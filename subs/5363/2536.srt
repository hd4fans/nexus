公元117年

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,750
罗马帝国的疆域从北非沙漠一直延伸到里海

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,670
而他们最渴望的是遥远的不列颠北部

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,600
在这片执拗的土地上

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,510
罗马人必须面对皮克特人凶狠的抵抗

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,240
通过使用游击战术并且利用地形优势

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,510
他们有效阻击了侵略者的步伐

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,100
这一僵局持续了20年之久

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,090
如今罗马人决心不惜一切结束这一局面

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,380
百夫长

17
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,960
我叫昆图斯・迪亚斯
My name is Quintus Dias.

18
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,880
是一名罗马士兵
I'm a soldier of Rome.

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,960
这不过是我人生的一个章节
And this is neither the beginning nor the end of my story.

20
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,020
两周前

21
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,660
英屈-图斯-伊尔  边境最北部的要塞

22
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,780
在前线奋战两年
Two years on the frontier.

23
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,660
这真是个鬼地方
This place is the asshole of the world.

24
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,620
万物都等着我们灭亡
Even the land wants us dead.

25
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,210
百夫长迪亚斯  这天站岗可真够冷的
Centurion Dias, it's too damn cold to be standing watch.

26
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,140
不是我的岗  
It's not my watch. 

27
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,210
我只想知道那边发生了什么
I'm just wondering what's out there.

28
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,690
巡逻队天亮就回来了  去睡会儿吧
The patrol returns at dawn. You should get some sleep.

29
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,710
在这里待得时间久了  
The longer we stay, 

30
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,650
刺骨的湿寒也侵入我们的身体
the deeper the cold and damp soaks into our bones.

31
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,410
雨水夹杂在北风中  
And the rain makes way only for the 

32
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,610
滴滴蜇人
stinging bite of the north wind.

33
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,450
腐蹄病和冻疮夺走了许多勇士
While we lose brave men to foot rot and frostbite,

34
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,050
皮克特国王高拉肯
the Pict King Gorlacon

35
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,440
肆意派遣士兵征战边境
sends his war parties to raid along the frontier at will.

36
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,090
-先生  -晚上好  长官
- Gentlemen. - Evening, Sir.

37
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,010
又是一个寒夜
A cold night on the front.

38
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,040
我父亲相信
My father believed that to truly defeat an enemy,

39
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,730
知己知彼才能百战百胜
you must know him better than yourself.

40
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,210
我对这伙人再熟悉不过
I know this enemy well.

41
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,300
他们只扬己长  
They play only to their strengths, 

42
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,220
绝不打亮堂仗
and will not be drawn into open combat.

43
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,550
只会揭你伤疤
Instead, they pick at the scab until we bleed,

44
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,520
他们藏身暗处   
hiding in the shadows like animals, 

45
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,320
手法凶残迅速
striking hard and fast

46
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,350
完事又立即闪入暗夜之中
then falling back into the night.

47
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,430
黎明之后  我们清点伤亡  掩埋亡卒
Come the dawn, we count our losses and sow the earth with our dead.

48
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,940
这是一场不同寻常的战争  
This is a new kind of war, 

49
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,510
没有荣誉  没有尽头
a war without honour, without end.

50
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,070
来人  来人啊
Come on! Come on!

51
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,640
马库斯  去找艾格里克拉
Marcus, ride to Agricola!

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,990
快开门
Gate. Move!

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,680
快
Move, soldier!

54
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
-格拉塔斯  -自己小心
- Gratus. - Save yourself.

55
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
去死吧

56
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,350
杀光得了

57
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,350
这个留着有用  让他跟我们一起走

58
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,670
威利鲁斯  威利鲁斯
Virilus! Virilus!

59
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,670
约克  第九军驻守要塞

60
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,550
赢家
The winner.

61
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,660
-干得漂亮  -没错
- That's the way! - Yes!

62
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,250
再来
Again!

63
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,930
够了
Enough!

64
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,140
你干得也不错  来跟我喝一杯
You put up a good fight, now you drink with me.

65
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,140
赛普图斯  再来点酒
Septus, more ale.

66
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,820
威利鲁斯  再来一局
Again, Virilus.

67
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,740
你喝高了  醉得不轻
You're a drunk. An ugly drunk.

68
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,310
还不太友好
And not too bright.

69
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,670
是不是输个10次才够啊
Isn't ten times enough to know when you're beaten?

70
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,670
去你的  再来
Damn you! Again!

71
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,590
来就来
Once more!

72
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,460
赛普图斯  你当裁判  盯紧点
Septus, your ruling. And watch my flank.

73
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,980
加油
Come on!

74
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,930
加油
Come on!

75
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,560
威利鲁斯  威利鲁斯  威利鲁斯 
Virilus! Virilus! Virilus! 

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,770
打败他  威利鲁斯  威利鲁斯
You beat him. Virilus. Virilus.

77
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,920
输不起的家伙
Sore loser.

78
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,100
赛普图斯
Septus?

79
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,020
你还等什么  
What are you waiting for, an order?

80
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,860
给我上
Get stuck in there!

81
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,810
妈的  一下子就清醒了
Damn, that'll sober a man up quick!

82
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,240
他们什么时候才明白第九军是惹不得的
When will people learn not to fuck with the ninth?

83
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,360
有人说难得见你当着
Some say it's irregular for you to be

84
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,090
士兵的面喝醉
seen drinking with the men of the legion.

85
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,340
哥们  他们都忘了  我也是军队一员
Septus, my old friend, they forget. I am a man of the legion.

86
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,310
打过仗吗  
Soldier, have you been fighting? 

87
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,760
战斗就是我的职责
Fighting is my job.

88
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,400
我来给你们将军稍信
I have a message for your general.

89
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,850
快点告诉我他在哪儿  否则小心我揍你
Now, point me in his direction before I have you flogged.

90
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,910
你是谁来着
Who are you?

91
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,630
我是艾格里克拉长官的特使
I'm the personal envoy of governor Agricola.

92
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,050
要是不想挨揍的话
I suggest you get down off that horse and give me your message

93
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,640
我劝你下马给我传话
before I have you flogged!

94
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,940
是  将军  这是我的荣幸
General, Sir! It would be my pleasure.

95
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,130
取消撤退
All leave is cancelled.

96
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,560
艾格里克拉动员九军奔赴杀场  
Agricola is mobilising the ninth. we're going to war, Septus.

97
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,920
赛普图斯  拆营  备战
Alert the senior legates to break camp and prepare the men.

98
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,920
对不起  将军 
Sorry, General, Sir... 

99
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,810
立即回艾格里克拉
Return to Agricola at once.

100
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,330
告诉他  我们一个小时之内出发  
Tell him we rode out within the hour. 

101
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,300
是  将军
Yes, General.

102
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,100
混蛋
Bastard!

103
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,100
死期到了  罗马人

104
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,120
艾侬
Aeron.

105
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,920
高拉肯曾是个农夫  后来他妻子被杀
Gorlacon. He was a farmer until his wife was killed. 

106
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,150
他便弃农从武
Then he put down the plough and took up the sword.

107
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,440
他成功改变了皮克特人的作战方式 
He changed the way the Picts fought. It worked.

108
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,580
他改变时局  因而称雄
He turned the tide, so they made him king.

109
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,600
我绝不屈服

110
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,370
艾格里克拉到底想干什么
What does Agricola intend for my people?

111
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,590
去你的  皮克特人  
Damn you, Pict!

112
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,240
他什么时候派兵北上
When will he send his armies north?

113
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,370
我是罗马士兵  绝不屈服
I am a soldier of Rome! I will not yield!

114
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,570
儿子  这就是你的敌人

115
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,400
罗马会让你为此付出血的代价
Rome will make you bleed for this.

116
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,410
百夫长  还是您先吧
You first, Centurion.

117
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,850
卡莱尔  不列颠总督朱利叶斯・艾格里克拉的总部

118
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,280
不管用什么手段  总之将他们斩尽杀绝
I don't care how you do it but wipe them out.

119
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,390
搞定高拉肯  以除我心头之患
And bring Gorlacon before me in chains.

120
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,550
长官  你是政治家  
Governor, you're the politician, 

121
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,960
我不过无名小卒
I'm just a simple soldier.

122
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,130
可我不能看着您
But I'm not so simple that I can't

123
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,810
撤兵回罗马
see you're looking for a way back to Rome.

124
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,060
罗马让我心痛  
My bones ache for Rome. 

125
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,420
而这里是野心的终结
This place is the graveyard of ambition.

126
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,290
还有人
And men.

127
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,810
我不能看着我的人做你游戏的筹码
And I won't sacrifice mine to be pawns in your game.

128
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
我理解
I see.

129
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,400
直说吧  将军
Let us be frank, General.

130
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,410
出兵英国失利是一切的根源
The conquest of Britain is a lost cause.

131
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,650
但我们重整旗鼓  必将扭转局面
With one bold stroke, we could change all that.

132
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,850
有你的第九军在  我们必将完败敌军
With the ninth legion at your command, we can crush this enemy.

133
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,930
你和兄弟们就可以载誉而归  尽享富贵
You and your men could retire with wealth and honour.

134
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,730
我的人不缺荣誉
My men have honour enough.

135
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,730
多到反抗命令吗
Enough to disobey a direct order?

136
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,470
好吧 
Well...

137
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,540
欲斩蛇先去其首
To kill the snake, you have to cut off its head.

138
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,190
我得先找到高拉肯
I need to find Gorlacon.

139
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,890
我已为你准备好人选
For that, I have someone special in mind.

140
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,880
威利鲁斯将军  这是艾坦
General Virilus, meet Etain, 

141
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,040
我们的侦查员  步里坎特人
my Brigantes tracker.

142
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,160
不能言语  却能在任何地形中寻到目标
Can't speak a word, but she can hunt anything over any terrain.

143
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,990
我保证她有狼族的血脉
I swear she's part wolf.

144
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,900
对于刚才的事情表示抱歉  只为证明
I apologise for the theatrics, but I wanted to prove a point.

145
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,490
几个奴隶不算什么  信任才是无价的
Slaves cost nothing. Trust is priceless.

146
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,490
我不知要与她为敌还是 
I don't know whether to fight her or...

147
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,260
她虽哑却不聋
She's mute, not deaf!

148
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,530
-我有自己的侦查兵  -比不上她的
- I have my own scouts. - Not like her!

149
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,240
她熟悉皮克特人  
She knows the Picts. 

150
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,990
他们的路线及藏匿处
Knows their ways, knows their hideaways.

151
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,610
她会带领你们入山的
She will guide you into the mountains.

152
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,070
她在那儿干吗呢
What's she sitting over there for?

153
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,100
-她整晚都盯着你  -我也注意到了
- She's been looking at you all night. - I've spotted it.

154
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,350
真是忍不住想看你啊
Can't take her eyes off you.

155
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,150
过来  过来
Come on, you.

156
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,650
她没法说话  你这个混球
She's speechless, you daft bastard.

157
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,010
她没有舌头  你这个蠢货  
She's got no tongue in her head, you fool. 

158
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,370
我不会过去的
I wouldn't get too close.

159
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,380
没有舌头岂不更爽 
No tongue, that's perfect, 

160
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,370
正好放这个
she'll have...more room for this.

161
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,790
你小心着点
You be careful. 

162
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,300
她肯定想说  "去你妈的"
I think that's pict for "fuck off".

163
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,010
她要能找到你家老二那还真是个好侦查兵
She must be a good scout if she can find your cock.

164
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,780
我相信她是在示爱
I think it's love.

165
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,170
这次真的跟这个蠢猪一起走了啊
I'll have a go with the mutt this time.

166
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,300
报告
Report.

167
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,000
3个皮克特骑兵  还有一个徒步的犯人
Three Pict riders and another, a prisoner, on foot.

168
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,210
我想他可能是罗马人
I think he might be Roman.

169
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,170
百夫长瑞姆斯  列队行进
Centurion Remus, take the column!

170
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,860
别动  趴着别动
Stay down! Stay down!

171
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,700
给我老实点
Stay down!

172
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,780
他完全没有利用价值
We'll get nothing out of him.

173
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
不能带着犯人上路  
We can't take prisoners on the march. 

174
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,890
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

175
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,820
-猜猜是哪面  -头像
- Head or ship? - Head.

176
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,840
我赢了
I win.

177
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,540
哥们  对不住了  有令在身
Sorry, mate. Orders are orders.

178
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
准备好了吗
Hey?

179
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,570
谢天谢地你们找到我了
Thank the Gods you found me.

180
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,340
该谢的不是天  是她
Not the Gods you should thank. It's her.

181
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,660
她叫艾坦  我们的皮克特人搜查者 
Etain, our Pict scout. 

182
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,800
是她发现了你
She found you.

183
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,030
你叫什么  士兵
What's your name, soldier?

184
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,870
昆图斯・迪亚斯
I'm Quintus Dias.

185
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,470
英屈-图斯-伊尔边塞副指挥
Second in command. Inch-tuth-il frontier garrison.

186
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,870
抱歉  我们来得不够及时
Well, sorry we couldn't get here sooner.

187
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,990
-你们是援军吗  -不算是
- Are you the relief column? - Not quite.

188
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,040
我是提图斯・弗拉维尔斯・威利鲁斯 
I'm Titus Flavius Virilus, 

189
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,230
第九军指挥
commander of the ninth legion.

190
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,070
我们来这里打仗
We've come here looking for a fight.

191
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,870
那算来对地方了
Then you'll get one.

192
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,730
-将军  -百夫长迪亚斯
- General. - Centurion Dias.

193
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,970
这才有点罗马人的样了  感觉如何
Now you look like a Roman. How do you feel?

194
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,660
遍体鳞伤  恐难短期康复
Cuts and bruises, Sir. Nothing that won't heal in time.

195
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,070
有时  有些伤疤是看不见的
Well, sometimes there are scars that cannot be seen.

196
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,080
你逃脱了高拉肯的魔爪
You escaped the clutches of Gorlacon,

197
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,920
我又得拉你入虎穴了
But I must ask you to return with us into the lion's den.

198
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,760
将军  我愿意投入战斗
Best to get back into the fight, General.

199
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,440
-是个军人  -是角斗士
- Spoken like a soldier. - Gladiator.

200
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,040
我父亲是西皮奥・迪亚斯
My father was Scipio Dias.

201
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,230
我亲证他赢得胜利  获得自由
I saw him win the fight that earned him his freedom.

202
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,190
他无与伦比
He was magnificent.

203
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,160
他教会我如何作战以及把握战机
He taught me how to fight, when to choose my battles.

204
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,040
来见见大家
Come meet the men.

205
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,520
-赛普图斯  -怎么了
- Septus. - Sir?

206
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,360
给他来杯酒  他可不容易
Get this man a drink. I think he deserves it.

207
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,210
一起喝一杯  暖暖身子  敬你一杯
Come and join us. Be warm. Have a well-earned drink.

208
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,750
谢谢
Thank you.

209
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,550
明天您与我并驾
Tomorrow you ride by my side.

210
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,450
也许你可以教教我皮克特的礼节
Perhaps you can teach me something about Pict hospitality.

211
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,140
-赛克斯  鲍特斯  -是
- Thax. Bothos. - Sir.

212
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,120
好的  将军
Sir.

213
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,310
赛普图斯  我再去巡视一下  
Septus, I'll be doing my rounds.

214
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,280
晚上好  将军  
Evening, General. 

215
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,090
这些皮克特人说话我一个字也听不懂
I can't understand a word of these Picts.

216
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,440
要是给他们逮住  那我可算完了
If they ever catch me, I'm fucked!

217
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,170
我从未见过哪个将军如此受人爱戴
I've never seen a general so beloved of his men.

218
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,320
在训练中  他是老师  
Well, in training he is our scholar, 

219
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,010
在餐桌上  他是父亲
at the feast he is our father,

220
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,330
在部队里  他是兄弟
in the ranks he is our brother.

221
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,150
在战场上  他是我们的神  
And in battle he is the God 

222
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,400
可以拯救我们的灵魂
we pray to save our souls.

223
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,120
-你从哪儿看来的  -那边厕所墙上写的
- Where did you read that? - It's written on the shithouse wall, Sir.

224
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,850
八成是他自己写的  
Probably wrote it himself. 

225
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,760
他是个无情  粗俗的混球
He's a ruthless, reckless bastard.

226
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,670
我愿意为他赴死  毫不犹豫
And I'd die for him without hesitation.

227
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,960
这是个陷阱
It's a trap!

228
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
列队  列队准备
Column! Form up! Form up!

229
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,400
快  快
Quickly! Come on!

230
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,250
下马  把马带到队末
Dismount! Get the horses to the rear!

231
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,350
严防  快
Tight! Quickly!

232
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,640
稳住  伙计们  
Steady, boys. 

233
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
驻盾
Shields!

234
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,400
注意
Watching!

235
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,130
不论出现什么  
Whatever comes out of that mist, lads, 

236
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,620
你们都得守住防线
you will hold the line.

237
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,820
昆图斯  你去队末
Quintus, ride to the rear.

238
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,940
让百夫长瑞姆斯把队伍带回来
Tell Centurion Remus to pull the column back.

239
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,290
-让道  -继续盯防
- Make a hole. - Keep watching!

240
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,090
准备好
Get ready!

241
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,900
注意了
Watching.

242
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,850
守住战线
Hold the line!

243
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,850
都给我起来
Stand tall!

244
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,740
-昆图斯  -鲍特斯
- Quintus. - Bothos.

245
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,940
-你还活着  -他救了我
- You made it. - Yeah. This man saved my life.

246
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,510
布里克  过来
Brick, here.

247
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,990
-将军呢  -不知道
- The general? - No.

248
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,910
我们得赶紧走了
We've got to move.

249
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,620
-你能行吗  -没问题
- Can you make it? - Yeah.

250
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,630
加油
Come on.

251
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,130
赶紧走了
Let's get moving.

252
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,870
在混战之中
In the chaos of battle,

253
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,260
当脚下的土地混杂血浆及各种污秽之物
When the ground beneath your feet is a slurry of blood, puke, piss,

254
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,410
以及人的内脏  无论是自己人还是敌人
and the entrails of friends and enemies alike,

255
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,400
你都会想到神灵  祈求他们的救赎
it's easy to turn to the Gods for salvation.

256
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,560
但战死沙场的永远都只有士兵
But it's soldiers who do the fighting and soldiers who do the dying.

257
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,520
神灵是不会染指血腥的
And the Gods never get their feet wet.

258
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
赛克斯 
Thax. 

259
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
谢天谢地  总算活下来了几个人
Thank the gods some of us made it.

260
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,390
只剩你了
Only you?

261
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,610
马克罗斯是二队的
Macros, second cohort.

262
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,270
里奥尼达斯是初级巡查  刀盾兵
Leonidas, junior scout and peltast.

263
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,030
-我们是仅存的人吗  -我们被算计了
- Are we all that's left? - We were outsmarted.

264
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,720
结束了  卸甲归田了
That's all. Time to go home.

265
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,500
我们得找到将军的尸体  
We need to find the general's body. 

266
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,750
得给他一个体面的墓地
He deserves a nobler tomb than this.

267
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,070
将军还活着
The general's still alive.

268
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,370
你确定吗  
Are you sure? 

269
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,900
我看见他们用链子把他绑走了
I saw them take him away in chains.

270
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,620
-哪个方向  -北方
- Which way? - North.

271
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,980
-那就北上  -你想跟着皮克特人吗
- Then we follow north. - You would go after the Picts?

272
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,230
他们会留巡逻队在森林里找生还者的
They'll have patrols sweeping these forests for survivors.

273
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,930
不如自行了断吧
We might as well slit our throats.

274
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,220
如果将军没死  这就是我们的职责
If the general's alive, it's our duty.

275
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,610
-你是哪儿来的  -炊事班
- Where did you come from? - From the kitchens.

276
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,890
干得好  士兵
Good work, soldier.

277
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,280
我叫泰力克
My name's Tarak.

278
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,000
我不是士兵  我是个厨师
I'm not a soldier, I'm a cook.

279
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,990
再也不是了
Not any more.

280
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,470
拣点有用的吧  食物或者兵器
Scavenge what you can, food supplies, weapons.

281
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,470
丢掉盔甲  得轻装上阵了
Ditch your armour. We travel light.

282
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,510
操  马克罗斯居然还能动
Shit! That Macros can move.

283
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,750
入伍之前他曾跑过马拉松
He used to be a marathon runner before he joined up.

284
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,260
你怎么知道的  
How do you know that? 

285
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,850
我们做饭的啥事不知
We make the food, we know everything.

286
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,720
我就知道不该相信那个臭婊子
I knew we should never have trusted that bitch.

287
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,480
我知道他们把将军带到哪儿了
I know where they've taken the general.

288
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,520
走
Move out.

289
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,910
这边  进洞
This way. The cave.

290
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,250
上山  快点
Get up the mountain, get up.

291
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,800
来  吃点东西
Here, some food.

292
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,410
别
No!

293
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,790
这是毒蘑菇  几分钟就能要了你的命
Death caps. They can kill you in minutes.

294
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,040
在一般人看来 
To the untrained eye, 

295
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,740
他们长得很像  而这个才是美味  
they look similar to these, which are delicious.

296
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,620
谢谢
Thanks.

297
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,480
泰力克  你是亚述人  对吧
Tarak. It's Assyrian, right?

298
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
没错
Yes.

299
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,870
但那不是我的真名  那是别人起的
But it's not my real name. It was given to me.

300
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,090
你真名叫什么  
What's your real name? 

301
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,260
不知道你会不会念
I doubt you could pronounce it.

302
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,980
我出生在兴都库什  那是一座山的名字
It's from the mountains of the Hindu Kush where I was born.

303
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,010
是里奥尼达斯吗
Leonidas, right?

304
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,920
-我父亲是希腊人  -靠火近点
- Greek father, sir. - Move closer to the fire.

305
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,080
-鲍特斯你来自哪儿  -军队
- Where are you from, Bothos? - I'm from the army.

306
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,600
打我记事起就在军队
It's all I've ever known.

307
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,260
他们把我从街头带到这里  训练我
They picked me up from the street, trained me,

308
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,170
告诉我这样能过上好日子
told me I could better myself.

309
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,590
告诉我  兄弟  你觉得怎么样呢
So, tell me, Bothos. Do you feel better or worse?

310
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,300
马克罗斯呢
Macros?

311
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,890
我从努米底亚逃出  捡回半条命
I escaped with my life by running from Numidia.

312
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,850
一直跑到希腊  在那儿做起运动员
Didn't stop until I reached Greece. Then I ran for sport.

313
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,170
现在又要为了活命起跑了
Now I'm running for my life again.

314
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,200
我们都背井离乡
We're all a long way from home.

315
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,410
-我以为这会是最后一程  -的确啊
- This was supposed to be my last tour. - Still could be.

316
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,330
我满脑子都是托斯卡纳农场  
Had my eye on a farm in Tuscany, 

317
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,630
阳光暖人
where the sun warms the skin.

318
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,970
布里克 
Brick...

319
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,030
这算哪门子的名字啊
What kind of name is that, anyway?

320
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,920
其实是  乌布瑞克琉斯的缩写
Short, sir...for Ubrickulius.

321
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,900
你妈妈可真是个 智慧的女人
Your mother must have been...wise.

322
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,460
她是个该死的喜剧演员
She was a fucking comedian.

323
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,280
所以就成"布里克"了
"Brick" it is, then.

324
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,580
睡会吧  我来站第一岗
Get some sleep. I'll stand first watch.

325
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,690
-将军  -我的人呢
- General. - Where are my men?

326
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,490
拜见阎王去了
With your gods.

327
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,530
叛徒
Traitor!

328
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,570
她听从指挥却从不开口说话  
She would answer your charge but she cannot speak. 

329
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,880
你知道这是为什么吗
Do you know why?

330
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,180
她找到我们寻求庇护的时候  还是个孩子
She was a child when she came to us seeking sanctuary.

331
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,240
她家所在的村庄惨遭屠杀
Her own village had been slaughtered

332
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,380
作为反抗罗马统治的惩罚
As punishment for resisting Roman rule.

333
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,920
这样说吧  罗马人烧了她父亲的双眼
To set an example, they burnt out her father's eyes.

334
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,670
强奸了她母亲  直到她祈求去死
They raped her mother until she was begging to die.

335
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,740
艾坦被迫在旁目睹
Etain was forced to watch

336
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,820
然后她也被强奸
before she too was raped.

337
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,450
最后罗马人割掉了她的舌头
And finally they cut out her tongue that she may not speak ill

338
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,890
以免她对血腥的罗马帝国出言不逊
of the bloody Roman empire.

339
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,340
她北逃到我们这里寻求庇护
She fled north and came to us for shelter.

340
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,710
等她成年  再送回你们身边
And when she came of age, we sent her back to you,

341
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,470
假装效忠于你们  好带你们入我的手掌
to feign allegiance and deliver you into our hands.

342
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,030
部队还没有集结
The army is still dispersed.

343
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,580
等天黑了  我们就潜入
When it's dark, we go in.

344
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,160
走 
Come.

345
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,280
快点
Come on.

346
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,970
布里克和鲍特斯  跟我来  
Brick, Bothos, with me. 

347
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,110
其他人  盯好周围
The rest of you, watch the perimeter.

348
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,000
将军
General.

349
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,900
军队呢  
The legion? 

350
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,980
只有我和一小队人幸存
Only myself and a small cohort remain.

351
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,210
我操
Oh, fuck.

352
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,330
真她妈的
Oh, shit.

353
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,700
快点
Come on.

354
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,280
别管我
Leave me.

355
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,840
闭嘴
Shut up.

356
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,310
-需要一把斧子  -快走
- We need an axe. - Leave!

357
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,840
我们不会丢下你的  将军
We will not abandon you, sir.

358
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,880
你现在就是军队指挥  马上给我走
What's left of the legion is yours to command. Now go.

359
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,790
我们必须走了
We have to leave.

360
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,910
快走
Go now!

361
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,950
把他们送回家
Get them home.

362
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,890
为了第九军
That's for the Ninth.

363
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,840
赛克斯呢
Where's Thax?

364
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,950
刚才解决了个小麻烦
Had to take care of a small problem.

365
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,850
我拿到将军的头盔了  他在哪儿
I've got the general's helmet. Where is he?

366
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,620
我们打不开锁  快走
We couldn't free him. Come on.

367
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,560
白费功夫了
We came all this way for nothing!

368
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,120
我操
Fuck.

369
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,720
看看你都干了些什么
See what you have done?

370
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,810
在你死之前
Before you die,

371
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,460
得让你知道那些人不会活着回去了
know that the men who did this will not live to tell your tale.

372
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,440
那就走着瞧吧
Well, let's get on with it, then.

373
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,710
你的同伴应该了解冷铁是不会弯曲的  
Your Roman friends should have known cold iron does not bend, 

374
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,070
只会折断
it breaks.

375
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,930
你们还等什么  怕了吗
Well, what are you waiting for? Do you fear me?

376
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,920
没一个纯爷们了吗
No man brave enough?

377
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,300
让我看看你是什么做的 小母狼
Let's see what you're made of...she-wolf.

378
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,850
走
Go!

379
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,710
快点儿  我们不能落下
Come on. We need to keep moving while we have the lead.

380
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,220
徒步吗  
On foot, over this? 

381
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,950
等他们追上来就晚了
Where they may hesitate, we must go.

382
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,120
我们继续赶路  向北
We keep moving. North.

383
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,080
我们的路线应该是向南
But our lines are to the south.

384
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,640
他们也是这么想的
And that's where they'll be looking for us.

385
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,440
听着  我们跑不过他们
Look...we can't outrun them.

386
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,950
所以我们必须比他们精明
So we have to outsmart them.

387
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,200
我们向北走  甩掉他们   
We head north, throw them off our trail, 

388
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,310
然后我们回去  先向西再向南
then double back, west, then south.

389
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,490
可能要几天  甚至几星期
It may take days, even weeks.

390
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,250
离我们的边界线还有很远  
But we're so far behind enemy lines, 

391
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,640
这是我们逃出去的唯一希望
it's our only chance of getting home.

392
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,740
走吧
Come on!

393
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,660
你会用到这个的  百夫长
You'll be needing this, then, Centurion.

394
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,190
艾坦  你代表了我的愤怒

395
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,440
杀了他们  拿他们的人头来见我

396
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,750
如果皮克特人在追捕  他们永远不会停歇
When the Picts come after you, they never stop.

397
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,410
他们能跑几个小时  骑马数日  
They can run for hours, ride for days. 

398
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,430
几乎不吃不睡
They barely eat and rarely sleep.

399
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,250
艾坦就像狼  从出生就学会了狩猎
Etain, like the wolf, has learned to hunt from birth.

400
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,670
这是她的直觉和本能
It is part sense, part instinct.

401
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,400
她能观察地形  寻找任何蛛丝马迹
She can read the terrain, search for signs of passing,

402
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,050
追寻她的猎物直至将其耗死
run her quarry to ground and close in for the kill.

403
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,330
现在  她的猎物就是罗马人
Now she hunts Romans.

404
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,050
而我们  正是她的目标
Now we are the prey.

405
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,410
快点儿  快
Move! Keep moving!

406
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,430
等等
Stop!

407
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,860
-利奥  我们不能停  -我们得歇会儿
- Leo, we've got to keep moving! - No. We need to rest.

408
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,330
我跑不动了  太冷了  
I can't go on, I'm too cold. 

409
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,670
过来  你扶着他
Come, take him.

410
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,630
布里克  找个避风的地儿
Brick, find shelter, anywhere out of this wind.

411
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,020
行  帮帮我
Enough. Help me.

412
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,050
他拖我们后腿了  
He's slowing us down. 

413
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,640
只要你一句话我就能解决掉
Just say the word and I'll take care of it.

414
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,520
我们是同生还是一个个惨死  由你决定
We live united or die divided...starting with you.

415
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,680
如果你愿意  可以坚持
You can stick this out if you want,

416
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,800
但是我一旦抓住机会就不会放过的
but first chance I get, I'm taking care of myself.

417
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,480
这事儿由你决定
It's your funeral.

418
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,700
当他们在脸上涂上蓝色时
When they paint their faces in the blue woad,

419
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,340
不仅是为了装饰
it is more than just a decoration.

420
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,420
那是一种宗教仪式
It is a sacred rite.

421
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,340
对于皮克特人来说  意味着失败了就得死
To the Picts, it means they'd sooner die than fail.

422
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,840
意味着他们没有回头路
It means for them...there is no turning back.

423
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,420
这些人是我所见过最棒的男人
These men are the best I've ever seen.

424
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,340
我能带他们走出去吗
Am I worthy enough to lead them?

425
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,630
父亲说过  
My father taught me that in life, 

426
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,830
责任和诚信是一生中最为重要的
duty and honour matter above all things.

427
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,920
一个人如果不能履行诺言就是禽兽不如
A man without his word is no better than a beast.

428
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,650
我答应过将军要带他们回去
I made a promise to a general to get his soldiers home.

429
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,780
这就是我的任务
That is my task.

430
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,090
我的责任
That is my duty.

431
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,780
还算是个希腊人  走
Not bad for a Greek. Come on.

432
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,340
趁热快喝
Drink while it's hot.

433
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,260
-这是什么  -胃
- What is that? - The stomach.

434
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,420
里面的苔藓还没消化完
The moss inside is half digested.

435
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,290
尝尝  味道不错
Try it, it's good.

436
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,220
昆图斯  他们会听到的
Quintus, they'll have heard him from miles away.

437
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,140
怎么了
What's wrong?

438
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,640
快跑  快
Move! Move! Move!

439
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,290
快跑
Move! Move!

440
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,440
这边
This way!

441
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,870
快  快走
Move. Come on, let's go.

442
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,360
这边  起来
Come on, get up!

443
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,090
他们追上来了
They're coming!

444
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,880
-他们越来越近了  -快跑
- They're closing. - Come on! Get your arses up here.

445
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,960
快  把你的手给我
Come on. Give me your hand!

446
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,640
不会吧
No!

447
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,900
操
Shit!

448
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,490
-我们必须跳  -你疯了吗
- We have to jump. - Are you out of your mind?

449
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,180
-快跳  -操你大爷的
- Do it! - Fuck it.

450
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,080
-我跳不了  -你能行
- I can't! - Yes, you can!

451
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,100
你能做到
You can do it!

452
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,860
不  泰力克
No! Tarak!

453
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,060
怎么样  这边来
Are you Ok? Come on up.

454
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,380
-拉住他  -拉住了
- Grab him. - I've got him.

455
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,900
泰力克呢
Where's Tarak?

456
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,940
他死了
I lost him.

457
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:33,040
赛克斯和马克罗斯呢
Thax, Macros?

458
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,710
过那边去 
Let's get out. 

459
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,420
来
Come on.

460
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,550
脱了盔甲  太沉了
Take off the tunics, they'll weigh us down.

461
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,870
操
Oh, shit.

462
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,970
-你还能走吗  -能
- Can you walk? - Yes.

463
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
那快跑吧
Then you can run.

464
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,680
他们在下游找我们
They've followed us downstream.

465
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:34,420
没错  继续
That's it. Keep going.

466
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,910
操
Shit!

467
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,550
她在往这边看  
She's onto us. 

468
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,290
该死的婊子  她怎么做到的
Damn witch. How can she do that?

469
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,530
不是魔法  她是个追踪者  
It's not magic, she's a tracker. 

470
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,720
正在我们下风口
And she's downwind of us.

471
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,820
什么情况  
What's happening? 

472
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,360
他们正在河谷扎营
They're making camp across the valley.

473
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,270
他们不在乎我们是否知道他们在哪儿
They don't care if we know where they are.

474
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,390
但是她不会想到我们会出现
But she won't expect it...us.

475
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,750
鲍特斯  看着利奥
Bothos, watch over Leo.

476
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,310
-你要干什么  -哪怕只有一线希望
- What are you going to do? - Going to even the odds.

477
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,220
过来
Come on.

478
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,080
昆图斯
Quintus!

479
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,830
她在哪儿

480
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,970
为什么追踪我们

481
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,800
你们的人杀了国王的儿子

482
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,930
高拉肯发誓

483
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:12,210
要你们的首级报仇

484
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,940
杀了他
Kill him and be done with it.

485
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,030
跟你过河的朋友已经死了

486
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,410
停下
No!

487
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,190
让他去死吧

488
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,150
他们把他的头拿走了
They took his fucking head.

489
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,750
-鲍特斯  -他们跟你想得一样
- Bothos! - They had the same idea as you.

490
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,830
他们没有捍卫他们的子民和国家
They're not defending their lives or their country any more.

491
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,010
只是起了一个要灭掉我们的血誓
They've sworn a blood vengeance against us.

492
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,830
他们不会停止
And they won't rest...

493
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,870
直到将我们耗死
...until we beg them...for death.

494
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,270
你打算下跪求饶吗
Are you ready to get on your knees and beg?

495
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,860
-我完了  没希望了  -你绝望了吗
- I'm finished. It's hopeless. - Hopeless?

496
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:38,860
那就正中他们下怀了
Hopeless is what they sing songs about, write poems about.

497
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,790
鲍特斯  决不能轻言放弃
Hopeless is the stuff of legend, Bothos.

498
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,520
那你就只有死路一条了
And being a legend will get you laid.

499
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,660
那我能怎么办
What do I have to do?

500
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,050
继续战斗  还有艰巨的任务等着我们
Keep moving, while we still have darkness on our side.

501
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,980
上帝已经不管我们了  
The Gods have forsaken us. 

502
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,940
现在只有自己救自己了
We make our own chances now.

503
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,080
马克罗斯  马克罗斯
Macros. Macros.

504
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,210
我 我不行了
I...I can't keep up.

505
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,290
起不来了
I can't keep up.

506
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,540
马克罗斯  至少我们俩能活一个
Macros, at least this way, one of us will make it.

507
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,470
-畜生  -马克罗斯  别喊了
- Bastard! - Don't cry out, Macros.

508
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,060
不喊的话  它们还能给你个痛快
They'll end it quicker if you don't cry out.

509
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,270
赛克斯别扔下我
Don't leave me! Thax!

510
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,950
赛克斯
Thax!

511
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,500
别过来
Come on!

512
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,970
此地不宜久留
We should give this place a wide berth.

513
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,850
我们得吃点东西好好歇一会儿
We need food and a place to rest.

514
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,470
这他妈的是什么鬼地方
Where the hell are we now?

515
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,020
-我去找点水  保持警惕  -好
- I'll get some water. Stay alert. - Yeah.

516
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,210
别怕别怕

517
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,320
我们不想伤害你

518
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,640
你是谁  在这儿干什么

519
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,340
布里克  进去
Brick, go back inside.

520
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,210
进去
Go back inside now.

521
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,250
这儿交给你了
I'll leave you to it, then.

522
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,380
我没什么用

523
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,880
我们不是强盗  我们是士兵

524
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,170
我们需要食物和藏身的地方

525
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,880
还有个人受伤  需要帮助

526
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,210
我们只是想回家

527
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:47,470
这个你拿着

528
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,090
我们不会伤害你的

529
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,520
我叫昆图斯・迪亚斯

530
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,710
我叫阿里安娜

531
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,930
你会讲我的语言
You speak my language.

532
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,020
我们的

533
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,140
你是驻军吗
Are you from the garrison?

534
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,670
我还以为你们再也不会来这儿了呢
I thought you'd stopped coming up this far north.

535
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,500
驻军  什么驻军
Garrison? What garrison?

536
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,230
他们往南走了两天了  
Two days south of here. 

537
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,840
他们来过这儿吗
They come here?

538
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,680
你怎么知道我会讲你们的语言
How do you think I know your language?

539
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,290
我尽我所能制止他们
I do what I can to discourage them.

540
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,970
但是他们以为我是个巫婆
They think I'm a necromancer...

541
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,690
然后就放了我
...and they leave me alone.

542
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,960
别人看见都会害怕
It usually works on the others.

543
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,360
为什么在你这儿不灵了
Why not you?

544
01:06:57,490 --> 01:07:00,000
我们已经累得不行了
We're too tired to be afraid.

545
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,770
我们3000人的军队现在只剩下3个了
We were 3,000 and now we are three.

546
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,450
给我吧
Here.

547
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,500
布里克  把那该死的刀放下
Brick, put the fucking knife down.

548
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,820
鲍特斯  罗马驻军离这儿就有两天的路程
Bothos, there's a Roman garrison two days from here.

549
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,460
一定是在门提斯的西防线军队
It must be the western frontier post at Mentieth.

550
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,300
两天吗
Two days?

551
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,490
看看你的朋友
Let's take a look at your friend.

552
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,280
昆图斯  她在干吗
Quintus, what's she doing?

553
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,290
她既是皮克特人  又是个女人 
She's a Pict and a woman...

554
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,970
两大不相信她的理由
Two good reasons not to trust her!

555
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,810
好了  这样就能止血了
Right, that'll stop the bleeding.

556
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,560
死亡之伞吗 
Death caps?

557
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,560
一种毒性蘑菇

558
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,940
味道不错
Smells good.

559
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,090
腿怎么样了  我们巫婆的魔法起作用了吗
Well, how's your leg? Has our witch worked her magic?

560
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,240
昆图斯  蘑菇有问题
Quintus, the mushrooms.

561
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,860
-怎么了  -她想毒死我们
- What? - She's trying to poison us.

562
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,430
治好你的腿就为了要害死你吗
Why heal your leg, only to kill you?

563
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,830
死亡之伞有白色菌丝
Death caps have white gills.

564
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,510
了解蘑菇得交点儿学费
It pays to know your mushrooms.

565
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,190
好极了
Good.

566
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,590
确实很好吃
It's really good.

567
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:26,920
-很好吃  -好吃
- It's delicious. - It's good.

568
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,220
你的人胆子很小
Your men are very nervous.

569
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,320
他们必须这样
They ought to be.

570
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,680
一个魔鬼日夜不停的追捕我们
A demon stalks us day and night.

571
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:51,920
魔鬼
A demon?

572
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,320
他们叫她艾坦
They call her Etain.

573
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,280
你知道她
You know her?

574
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,720
如果艾坦追捕你们  
If Etain is hunting you, 

575
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,440
你们早就该死了
you might as well be dead already.

576
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,630
听上去我很欣慰
That's comforting.

577
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,910
她的灵魂是一个空的容器
Her soul is an empty vessel.

578
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,350
只有罗马人的血才能够装满
Only Roman blood can fill it.

579
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,070
阿里安娜呢
Where's Arianne?

580
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,160
她出去给我们找早餐去了
She went to fetch us some breakfast.

581
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,180
你还好吗
Are you OK?

582
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,390
那算是鱼饵吗
Is that for bait?

583
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,010
在我们那里  
Where I come from it's considered rude 

584
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,960
打断人撒尿是不礼貌的
to interrupt a man midflow.

585
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,530
在我们那里  警告他不要往早餐里撒尿
Where I come from it's considered only fair to warn a man

586
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,320
是件好事儿
when he's pissing on his breakfast.

587
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,400
也对
Good point.

588
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,360
昨晚在山上肯定有场暴风雨
Must've been a storm in the hills last night.

589
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,040
快走
Come on!

590
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,670
-有麻烦了  -鲍特斯  快离开这儿
- Trouble. - Let's get out of here. Bothos.

591
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,500
晚了
Too late for that.

592
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,200
藏在谷仓里别出声
Hide in the grain store and don't make a sound.

593
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,040
女巫  我们在找罗马杂种

594
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,400
我没见过

595
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,100
你可以检查一下

596
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,650
只是别在我的房子留下臭味

597
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,300
这是我的一切

598
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,530
艾坦  有问题吗

599
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,000
你的舌头让猫吃了吗

600
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,870
艾坦  不要  

601
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,000
她死了我们的部落会受诅咒的

602
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,880
我们带给你太多的危险  我们要走了
We put you in too much danger. We'll leave.

603
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,520
现在走  她会傍晚前就将你们碎尸万段
Leave now and she'll have you gutted and skinned before nightfall.

604
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,290
待到明天早晨  那时你的朋友也能走路了
Stay until morning, and your friend will be fit to travel.

605
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,490
他们是你的同族
These are your people.

606
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,290
他们不是我的同族
They are not my people.

607
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,170
自从高拉肯说我是女巫  
Not since Gorlacon accused me of witchery

608
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,950
并在我脸上留下这个印记以后就再也不是了
and gave me this...

609
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,210
它代表驱逐
to mark me as an outcast,

610
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:21,250
并将我流放在这里  孤独终老
and banished me to live out my days here, alone.

611
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,540
我们还要面临怎样的厄运呢
What cruel devices does fate yet have in store for us?

612
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,700
在敌人的领地找到这样的庇护地
To find sanctuary in the house of our enemy.

613
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,300
她是个天使
Is she angel...

614
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:43,150
抑或是个恶魔
...or devil?

615
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:50,550
-一切安全  -好
- Clear. - All right.

616
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,700
休息一下吧
Get some rest.

617
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,880
我是个驴脾气的老兵
I'm a cantankerous old soldier...

618
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,040
但还不至于不敢承认自己的过错
...but not too stubborn to admit when I'm wrong.

619
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,480
我曾误会过你  对不起
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

620
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,080
希望你能原谅
There it is.

621
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,880
-外面冷  -谢谢
- It's getting cold. - Thank you.

622
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:59,070
你收留了我们  
You've given us the shelter of your home, 

623
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:00,820
给予我们温暖
the warmth of your fire,

624
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,420
并舍身相救
and risked your life for us.

625
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,060
为了什么
Why?

626
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:10,670
我只忠于自己选择的人
I owe allegiance to no man, but to whom I choose.

627
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,050
这是一些吃的
Here's some food for the journey.

628
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,650
谢谢
Thank you.

629
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,010
祝你们好运  罗马人
Good luck, Roman.

630
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,170
也祝你好运  女巫
Good luck, witch.

631
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,710
鲍特斯  起来  坚持住
Bothos, get up. Come on.

632
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,590
我的腿
My leg!

633
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,150
看  看  看那边的炊烟
Look! Look! See, the fire's burning.

634
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,830
有美食和温床  坚持住
Look, hot food and a dry bed. Come on.

635
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,950
艾格里克拉已经撤退
Agricola has fallen back.

636
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,370
哈德良国王命令
Emperor Hadrian has given orders to

637
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:49,710
组建新的南方防线
form a new defensive line to the south.

638
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,960
放弃我们所征战的土地
Giving up the ground we fought for.

639
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,720
-那我们去哪儿呢  -去他妈的
- And where does that leave us? - Fucked.

640
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,490
她是怎么知道的
How does she do that?

641
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,710
我不知道你们怎么想的  我是不想跑了
I don't know about you, but I'm tired of running.

642
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,460
我只能找到这么多  
This is all I could find.

643
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,160
这就是它们的价值
Make them count.

644
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,080
为了威利鲁斯
For Virilus.

645
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,800
为了第九军
For the Ninth.

646
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,600
鲍特斯  他们在西面侧攻我们
Bothos, they're flanking us. West wall!

647
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,450
布里克
Brick!

648
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,370
来吧
Come on!

649
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,890
-你觉得还有多远  -不知道
- How much further do you think? - I don't know.

650
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,480
一天  也许两天
A day's ride. Maybe two.

651
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,550
赛力克  差不多就行了
That's close enough, Thax.

652
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,100
我操
Oh, shit!

653
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,580
我以为你们是皮克特人呢
I thought you were Picts.

654
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:20,350
我们以为你死了呢
We thought you were dead.

655
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,750
马克罗斯呢
Where's Macros?

656
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,500
让狼给吃了
Wolves got him.

657
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,820
难道就剩下我们几个了吗
Is this it? Are we all that's left?

658
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,930
至少我们活下来了
Hey, at least the three of us made it!

659
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,550
-我们还没到家呢  -什么意思
- We're not home yet. - What are you talking about?

660
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,190
-我们现在应该是在边界上  -不
- We should be at the frontier by now. - No.

661
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,810
艾格里克拉已经下命令了
Agricola's been given his marching orders.

662
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,730
所以  罗马最终还是放弃了这个
So, Rome's finally given up on this 

663
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:13,750
见鬼的地方
shithole of a country, then?

664
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,430
那就不用遗憾了
Can't say that I'm sorry.

665
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,950
我们的战争一文不值
Then we fought for nothing.

666
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,810
赛克斯  你对那个男孩做了什么
What happened with the boy, Thax?

667
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,240
我不知道你在说什么
I've no idea what you're talking about.

668
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,280
这就是哈德良宏伟的计划吗  御城墙
This is Hadrian's big, fucking plan? A wall?

669
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,310
管他呢  我们终于到了
Hey, who cares? We made it.

670
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,640
-走吧  -鲍特斯  等等
- Let's go! - Bothos, wait!

671
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,350
百夫长  等等
Slow down, centurion.

672
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,390
赛克斯  你要干什么
Thax, what are you doing?

673
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,470
只是想沟通一下
Just making sure that we understand each other.

674
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,430
我们这么多好兄弟都是因你而死
I understand that many good men died because of what you did,

675
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:56,190
你敢于承认吗
and you will answer for it.

676
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:58,650
为什么我才知道你是这样想的呢
Why did I just know you were going to feel that way?

677
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,010
鲍特斯
Bothos!

678
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,840
这证实了我们最担心的事情
This report confirms our worst fears.

679
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,110
你是个战场上的好士兵  
You fought your war, soldier, 

680
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,710
罗马人感谢你
and earned the gratitude of Rome.

681
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:28,380
你跟他去我的私人房间  吃点儿东西
This man will show you to my private quarters, he will see you fed.

682
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,540
你一定饿坏了
You look half starved.

683
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:38,380
我们不能带着耻辱回去
We cannot return to Rome in disgrace.

684
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:41,370
让军团的事迹成为一团迷雾
Better that the fate of the legion remain a mystery

685
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,400
好过失败大白于天下
than the truth of their failure be known.

686
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,220
如果这事传出去  
If word gets out, 

687
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,540
所有的部落国家都会反击
every tribe and every nation will rise against us.

688
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,810
这样做太冒险了
It's too great a risk.

689
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,130
我们达成共识了吗
Are we agreed, then?

690
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,330
第九军的事迹将从历史上消失
The fate of the ninth legion will be struck from the record.

691
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,600
希望这些吃的合你胃口
I hope the food is to your liking.

692
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,120
给你带些红酒
I've brought you some wine.

693
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,750
我们只能为罗马的英雄做这么多了
It is the least we can do for a hero of Rome.

694
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
这就是罗马人对待他们英雄的方式吗
Is this how Rome honours her heroes?

695
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,750
你想杀人灭口隐藏事实吗
You want to bury the truth and me along with it?

696
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,310
你活着对我们是个威胁
You are too much of a risk.

697
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,870
你要去哪儿
Where will you go?
