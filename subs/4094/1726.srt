Come on.

476
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,870

ordered, mind you,

477
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,705
to stay out of Baghdad.

478

-Cut, dried, the end.
-LYNCH: General,

479
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,794
we should find him
a little wiggle room, don't you think?

480
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:15,049
You know, l knew another Lynch,
a ClA stooge.

481
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,051
Stationed in Laos, '68.

482
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
-No relation.
-Are you sure?

483
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,930
'Cause you remind me of him.

Forget about it, Hannibal.
Steer clear of this one.

493
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,097
Well clear of it.

494
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,976
This is a gauntlet run
right through the heart of Sadr City.

495
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,023
Saddam Hussein
was a certifiable madman,

496
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,192
but even he wasn't crazy enough

497
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,445
to go into that place
more than once in 30 years.

498

Well, this isn't about
you losing a step now.

-Hey.

507
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,637
the boys and l can get this done,
minus the bloodshed.

508

Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

509

Don't make me beg.

510

l'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

You've been my friend for a long time.

512
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,651
More importantly,

513
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,612
you and those boys have possibly been

514
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,117
the most valuable military asset
l have ever had at my disposal.

515
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,912
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

516
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,749
Right now, l'm begging you.

517
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,086
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

518
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:21,133
Russ, this is too big an enterprise.
We can't let these bozos do this.

519
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,843
lt's way too big.

520
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,430
And you'd do it
with or without my blessing?

521
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,515
No, that l wouldn't.

522
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,517
l need your blessing.

523
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,399
l'm not so sure that it is a blessing.

524
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,695
Good hunting, my friend.

525
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Thank you.

526

How'd it go with the old man?

527
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,205
Same old, same old. What you got there?

528
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,999
Pictures of my new baby.

Who's a proud papa?

Murdock gets to that van.

01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:55,972
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1543
01:29:57,808 --> 01:29:58,892
What?

1544
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:07,233
You had to know.

1545
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,241
You had to know if you left me alive,
that this was coming.

1546
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,124
How could you not?

1547
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:35,428
You taught me almost everything l know.

1548
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:40,600
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1549
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:53,446
We all do.

1550
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:58,868
Morrison?

1551
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,829
Hell, no.

1553
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:08,545
Not so sure that it is a blessing,
but good hunting, my friend.

Thank you.

You're not a general.

How could you do this to him?

1559
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,739
How could you do this to us?

1560
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,826
You know nothing about leading men.

1561

l knew if Lynch helped me escape,
you had to be part of it.

1562
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,170
You and Pike were making a play
on those plates with Lynch,

1563
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,504
and you turned on him.

1564
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:53,923
The way you turned on us.

1565

Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1566
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,763
He was gonna use us.

1567
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,267
He brought you on as insurance.

1568
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:08,021
He never thought you'd betray
your oldest living friend.

You're a liar and a traitor!

1571
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,862
Then don't draw this out. Kill me.

1572
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:18,489
That's a fantastic idea!

1573
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,116
B.A.: Whoa! Whoa!

1574
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,118
Bos, let me do this.

1575

Face, l ain't killing nobody.

You're not, Bosco. l am.

do not kill him, okay?

Just turn your heads.

-l wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

but he's our ticket out.

1581

about for once. Listen to him.

1582
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:41,429
-Face, he is our only evidence.
-Murdock, Murdock...

-MURDOCK: Do you understand?
-He put us here.

1584
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,850
MURDOCK: You can blow his head off
after he testifies, okay?

1585
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:46,893
He's ruined it!

Everybody outside.

HANNlBAL: Face, outside.

1593
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,495
Stand down, soldier.

1594
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:08,164
Face. Now!

1595
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,625
FACE: Fucking stupid.
MURDOCK: You okay, man?

1596
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:15,588
HANNlBAL: You knew Morrison
was masquerading as the Arab.

1597
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,840
-Why not share that?
-LYNCH: l wasn't 100% sure.

How about 99%?

1599
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,262
Would you think
it was worth mentioning then?

1600
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,305
Lynch, what did you think?

1601
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:26,599
You think l'd just kill him on the spot?

1602
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,102
l was certain of it. l still am.

1603

Do you have the plates?

1604
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:32,855
l wouldn't be calling you if l didn't.

1605
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,319
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison,
and reclaim your lives.

l'm gonna need a little more time.

1612

How much?

1613
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:03,886
Give me five minutes.

we die for them...

Don't push this off on them.
This is not about them.

stealing billions of dollars!

Who are you?

1624

l am a general. You are a colonel.

2003
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:45,974
LYNCH: Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

2004
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:48,727
HANNlBAL: Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

2005
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:54,482
Lynch...

2006
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,526
Where am l?

2007
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:01,239
Come on, Lynch.

2008
01:58:04,076 --> 01:58:05,285
Lynch.

2009
01:58:06,036 --> 01:58:07,954
Where am l, Lynch?

2010
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,124
Come on, Lynch.

2011
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:14,377
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

2012
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:17,255
Lynch!

2013
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:36,107
(WHOOPS) There you are, Hannibal.
Been looking all over for you.

2014
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:39,277
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

2015
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:43,448
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but...

2016
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:47,410
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

2017
01:58:47,495 --> 01:58:50,955
and the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

2018
01:58:52,249 --> 01:58:57,128
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

2019
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:00,548
There's your monkey wrench.

2020
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
MORRlSON ON RECORDlNG:
Hannibal, don't do this.

2021
01:59:02,134 --> 01:59:06,387
You know, Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world...

2022
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:08,348
-MORRlSON: You owe me that much.
-...but you drop a few bullets

2023
01:59:08,432 --> 01:59:10,058
-into the batter...
-Hannibal, don't do this.

2024
01:59:10,142 --> 01:59:12,310
-HANNlBAL: Lynch, no!
-Hannibal, please.

2025
01:59:12,394 --> 01:59:13,728
Oh, God.

2026
01:59:15,564 --> 01:59:17,607
...and that cake don't bake.

2027
01:59:17,691 --> 01:59:21,402
Uh-oh. Your witness,
your gun, your problem.

2028
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:27,367
You served your country well. Excuse me.

2029
01:59:33,123 --> 01:59:36,042
Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

2030
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:41,339
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

2031
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,883
l'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

2032
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:46,719
(TUTTlNG) Don't get up.

2033
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,769
God damn it!

2034
01:59:55,312 --> 01:59:58,147
Your muay Thai is as bad
as yourjujitsu, Lynch.

2035
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:02,068
Better stick with a gun.

2036
02:00:02,152 --> 02:00:05,405
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
l'll put a bullet in your head.

2037
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:23,798
l told you l would shoot you.

2038
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:26,968
Kevlar saved your life.

2039
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,138
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if l pop you in the head.

2040
02:00:30,222 --> 02:00:32,348
lt does if you melt it down.

2041
02:00:33,976 --> 02:00:35,518
MORRlSON: Hannibal, don't do this.

2042
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,770
-Hannibal, please.
-FACE: So, you beat a guy like that

2043
02:00:37,855 --> 02:00:39,814
by drawing him in with three things.

2044
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:42,901
-Distraction.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

2045
02:00:42,985 --> 02:00:44,485
Diversion.

2046
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:46,112
And division.

2047
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:50,742
MORRlSON: Hannibal, don't leave me alive.

2048
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:53,828
FACE: Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

2049
02:00:57,249 --> 02:00:58,625
What the...

2050
02:01:13,223 --> 02:01:14,641
That's good.

2051
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:18,269
Surprise.

2052
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:20,855
Agent Burress.

2053
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,691
What did you call me?

2054
02:01:24,526 --> 02:01:26,569
Agent Vance Burress?
lsn't that your name?

2055
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:29,197
At least that's the name l've got
on this warrant here,

2056
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:33,451
and unless you have a piece of paper
that looks exactly like...

2057
02:01:34,161 --> 02:01:35,578
That's funny. That's what l said.

2058
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,205
She's quoting me.

2059
02:01:37,456 --> 02:01:39,165
Easy, easy.

2060
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,252
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

2061
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,296
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

2062
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,883
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

2063
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,385
Easy.

2064
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,139
l guess the plan went okay,

2065
02:01:55,224 --> 02:01:58,810
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which l didn't account for at all.

2066
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:00,895
Bullets didn't go through.

2067
02:02:01,897 --> 02:02:03,606
MORRlSON: Hannibal, don't do this.
Hannibal, please.

2068
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:05,692
How are you feeling, man?

2069
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:07,402
Not... Not good.

2070
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:09,529
-What's wrong?
-Not good.

2071
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,781
-l feel sane.
-(LAUGHS)

2072
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:14,325
l should have shot you in the head
a long time ago.

2073
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:17,161
ls it crazy
that l'm feeling
