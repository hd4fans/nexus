7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,170
墨西哥某地

8
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,890
只有無比頑固的美國佬才會來這鳥不拉屎的地方
Only a hardheaded gringo... Would come down here...

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,100
執行什么援救計劃  而且居然是單槍匹馬
On a rescue mission... ALL ALONE

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,980
這美國佬不肯開口說話
This gringo is not going to talk.

11
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,600
那就殺了他
Then kill him.

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,690
速度點  將軍在等著我們呢
C'mon, the General's expecting us.

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,570
你不能用自己的槍
You can't use your gun...

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,870
用他自己的槍射殺他
...Shoot him with his.

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,340
這槍用不了
It's not working.

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,410
這兔崽子的槍連撞針都沒有
This asshole's gun has no firing pin.

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,230
別管他了
Leave him.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,190
狗狗們好久沒試過自己殺死獵物了
The dogs haven't had to kill for their food in a while.

19
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,900
朋友  下次
Next time, amigo,

20
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,150
先計劃好再來
plan ahead.

21
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,990
我真是個偽天主教徒
Oh, I'm such a bad Catholic.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,250
才不  你就是腦子有病罷了
No, you're just sick in the head.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,540
別忘了要拿給將軍的錢
Don't forget the General's money.

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,670
那美國佬賄賂錯警察了
That gringo bribed the wrong cop...

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,000
還帶了一把沒撞針的槍
...and brought a gun with no firing pin.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,700
撞針在這里

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500

"怪頭"  博斯克·拜庫斯

32

傻蛋  我心肝寶貝呢
Where's my girl, fool?

33
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,530
她很好  就在那里面  她好得不得了  
She cool, man. She in there. She's still fine as hell.

34
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,370
就這樣嗎  你在巴達被轟出局了嗎
So that's it? Bada-bing, you out of the game?

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,600
生意都吹了嗎
Done with the whole trade?

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,330
-對  -問題就在這  博斯克
- Yeah.  - Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

37
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,710
要么繼續  要么就在墨西哥
You either keep doing that,

38
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,580
監獄好好呆上十五年  
or you do a 15- year bid in a Mexican prison

39
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,630
和齊拓表兄一起
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

40
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,960
還是老一套  你自己收拾爛攤子吧  哥們
Same old shit. You choose how to flush the toilet, brother.

41
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,760
好了  吃軟的還是吃硬的
That's right. Easy way or the hard way.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
可憐蟲

43

注意點  怪頭  你連我這老朋友都要失去了
But watch yourself, B.A., now, you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,210
傻瓜

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,050
還好嗎  心肝  想我嗎
What's up, girl? You miss me?

48
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,390

Because l missed you. Yes, l did. It's been too long, baby.

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,310
太久太久了

這鬼地方還真漂亮
Just a heck of a beautiful place.

It's very Arizona, very Tex-Mex. It's good. It's good.

56
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,120
不如我們把我六點鐘方向的那人叫來
Maybe we can get the guy at my six

57
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,460

You're not so intelligent because you're stuck in some tires.

64
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,270
我很開心  真開心

69
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,780
但你卻在那和我妻子盡情云雨

你是在攔路搶劫嗎
You jacking me?

78
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,730
這算什么  太陽從西邊出來了嗎
What is this, opposite day?

我不是搶劫犯  但如果我不及時趕到  我朋友就會死
I'm not a thief. But if l don't reach my friend in time, then he dies.

Take your left hand off the wheel and your right hand off the shifter now.

You ain't gonna shoot me in the head, pops.

83
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,080
你自己心里清楚
You know that ain't happening.

84
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,040
你他媽的有病嗎  
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

85
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,500
隨隨便便就開槍打陌生人
You shoot a total stranger?

86
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,500
我都不認識你  操
l don't even know you, fool. Damn.

87
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,300
這點傷死不了

- Here, wrap it in this.  - l know how to make a tourniquet, fool.

l know it hurts, but l had to make a point with you.

90
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,720
你以為是這把我惹毛了嗎  才不是
That ain't what's pissing me off.

You shooting my van is what's pissing me off, man.

92

你腦子有病嗎
What's wrong with you?

93
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,190
你是陸軍游騎兵嗎  小子
You Army Ranger, son?

94
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,860
大叔  小心斟酌你要說的下一句話
Be real careful of what you say next, pops.

95
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,650
要是敢污蔑我的隊伍  就準備好被我塞進引擎箱吧
And be ready to empty that burner if you start shit-talking my battalion.

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,570
從不讓我的戰友失望

英勇的向全世界宣告我就是救世主
Gallantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected soldier.

98

我將在戰場上把他們擊敗

100
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,920
因為我比他們更強
for l am better trained.

101

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,840
這滋味肯定不好受

寶貝  我剛吐完  
Baby, l just threw up.

你看到了嗎  你看到圖克的臉色了嗎
Did you see that? Did you see Tuco's face?

144
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,940
你過來的時候簡直叫人難以相信
When you came over, that was unbelievable!

145

You know what? I'm sorry.

150
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,870
我很抱歉  沒按戰神大人的意思去做
I'm sorry l didn't have the Hannibal Smith How-to Manual.

151
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,870
-但是我必須得行動  -你的行動闖了大禍  小白
- Okay? l had to move.  - And that move snowballs, Face.

152
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,830
你差點害死你自己
You almost got yourself killed.

153
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,170
你還差點害死我  還差點害死他
Which almost got me killed and almost got him killed.

154
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,630

我有開槍打壞你的車嗎
Did I shoot up your van?

158

我穿走了你最中意的襯衣嗎
Am I wearing your favorite shirt?

159
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,180
這是你最中意的襯衣嗎
This is your favorite shirt?

160
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,810
是的  靚仔  這件就是
Yeah, pretty boy, that's my favorite shirt.

161
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,190
你還為我挨槍子了嗎
Did you get shot for me, too?

162
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,730
-車還被搶了  -我搶的
- And carjacked.  - By me.

163

我是拜庫斯  沒什么
Baracus. It's all good.

166
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,710
看到了吧  小白  這就是沒有按計劃來的下場
See, Face, this is what happens when we forget about plans

167
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,210
盲目開火
and just fire blind.

168
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
抱歉
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,340

Save her? How?

176
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,480
得了  你有什么計劃  說來聽聽  小白
Please, do share with us your plan, Face.

177
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,700
好吧  我還沒想過什么計劃
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

178
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,490

And don't bullshit me that this was about her, Face.

182
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,460
這只是為了干掉圖克
This was all about Tuco.

183
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,380

194
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,790
這是給你的

不需我提醒你  他們不能到了美國佬手中

How am l gonna just leave my girl like this, after all that?

200
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,480
我可是大打出手才把她搶回來
l had to fight to get her back.

201
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
取下車鑰匙  到時再回來取她
Leave the keys and we'll come back for her. Come on.

202

- This is worse than Colombia.  - I know Tuco, man.

Don't worry about it. I'll take her to war college in Saint Tropez.

- Face, look after the Corporal.  - Yeah. Okay.

208

And you're covered in gas, which I think is interesting.

209
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,550
去找大夫看看你的傷  下士  
Find a treatment room, Corporal.

210

大夫  你有空來看看這個傷者嗎
Hey, Doc, you got a second for a wounded vet?

212
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,990
小瘋魔  默多克上尉

花瓶戰斗機飛行員
Highly decorated combat pilot.

214
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,540
但你問他  他絕對會說自己最出色
You ask him, he thinks he's the best in the world.

215
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,620
但他是個還有點用的瘋子
But he's a functioning lunatic.

216
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,720
上周他想修好一輛救護車用來逃跑
Last week he tried to escape by jump-starting an ambulance.

- The old Ranger tat.  - Mr. Murdock?

- What ward?  - This man is a patient here.

230
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,910
是你嗎  別聽她的  她瘋了
ls this you? Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

231
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,120
老實說  我還是霍普金斯大學的實習醫生呢
Honestly, I'm a practicing doctor at Johns Hopkins University.

-我太喜歡你們游騎兵了   -你腦子注水了嗎
- You Rangers. I like you!  - Are you crazy?

238
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,640
喂  住手
Hey! Hey, come on!

239
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,480
下士  退后
Corporal, off. Back off!

240

244
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,160
看著我  小子
Look at me, son.

245
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,740
據說你是個超棒的直升機飛行員
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

246
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,990
是最好的  長官
The best, sir.

247
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,450
我才不坐這瘋子開的直升飛機
I'm not getting on a chopper with this nut job.

248
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,580
好極了  他也是你計劃的一部分嗎 
Yeah, that's a good... ls he another one of your projects?

249

我是貨真價實的戰士  我是個游騎兵 
I'm a real soldier. I'm a Ranger, baby.

250
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,540
壓力真大
I'm worried!

251

這對我來說就足夠了

你被我們接管  
You have been released into our care

謝謝你  長官
Thank you, sir.

256
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,470
我們離開這鬼地方吧

想我沒有
Did you miss your daddy?

259
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,820
小白  知道計劃萬無一失  最重要的是什么嗎
Face, what's the most important part of a well-oiled plan?

260
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,200
要占據先機  
To be one step ahead of the enemy,

261
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,120
-而不是落荒而逃  -誰說我們要逃跑了
- not to be running away from him.  - Who says we're running?

262
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,950
什么  我們要和那瘋子
What, we're going to go in this dinosaur

263
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,250
-一起鉆進這骨灰級灰機里嗎  -嗯哼
- with this freak show?  - Yep.

264
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,880
你把我迷得團團轉  團團轉
You spin me right round, baby Right round

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
-螺旋翼沒問題  長官  -這家伙到底是誰
- Rotors are good, sir.  - Who is this guy?

266
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,010
快點  我們走
Come on! Let's go!

267

干掉美國佬
We've got gringos to kill!

268
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,180
默多克  把這玩意弄上天去
Murdock, get this thing in the air.

269
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,720
抓緊咯  
Hold on, boys!

270
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,980
我要試試在卡通里看到的把戲
I'm gonna try something l saw in a cartoon once.

271
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,480
你說卡通是毛意思  快把我們弄走
What you talking about cartoons for? Get us the hell out of here!

272
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,190
六點鐘方向有敵方直升機
We got a hot chopper to your six.

273
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,740
金剛罩  你們打不到我  打不到我
I'm blocking bullets. We're bulletproof.

274
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,490
金剛罩  打不到我
We're bulletproof, boys!

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,160
小心
Oh, heads up.

276
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,830
我看見你了  美國佬 
I see you, gringo!

277
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,710
你把我的心肝寶貝壓成了薄餅  我要殺了你這混蛋
You pancaked my van! I'm gonna kill you, fool!

278
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,880
你不能停在那里  那是殘疾人專用的
You can't park there. That's a handicap zone.

279
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,380
-我就知道你是個瘋子  神經病  -我已經后悔了
- l knew you was crazy! l knew...  - This is a mistake.

280
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,230
開火
Fire! Fire! Fire!

281
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,400
把他們打下來
Blow them out of the sky.

282
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,910
我從來沒有這樣試過
I've never tried this before!

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,780
你看到了嗎
Did you see that?

284
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,040
你看到他讓直升飛機做空翻了嗎
Did you see how he turned the helicopter?

285
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,130
這空對空作戰真刺激  是不  老兄
Whoa! There's nothing like some good air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

286
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,670
別看我  看前面
Don't look at me! Look there!

287
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,460
他只剩熱感導彈了  
He's only got heat seekers left.

288
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,720
上尉  把我們弄走
Captain, get us out of here.

289
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,010
抓緊了  這可不好受  
Hold on, this could get ugly!

290
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,600
準備好  加油啊  寶貝  繼續爬升
Here we go! Come on, baby, climb!

291
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,310
發射導彈 
Fire the missiles.

292
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,780
哇哇  導彈  來吧
Whoa! Missiles! Come on, come on.

293
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,950
這就是對付熱感導彈的方法
That's how we deal with heat seekers, chaps.

294
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,990
我們熄火
We go cold.

295
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
搞毛
What the hell?

296
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,000
小白  快把他弄進來
Face, get him in here!

297
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,080
媽了個逼的
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

298
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,960
抓住他了
Got him!

299
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,340
重啟
Restart. Restart.

300
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
關好門
Close the door!

301
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,430
我知道你是空降兵  但那也太夸張了吧
l know you're Airborne Rangers, but that was ridiculous!

302
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,930
你會沒事的
You're gonna be okay.

303
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,890
頭兒  我們是要殺了圖克  不是被殺
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco, not the other way around!

304
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,770
搶先一步并不是計劃  小子
One step ahead of the game isn't a plan, kid.

305
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,150
而是要搶先兩三步
Two to three steps ahead.

306
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,820
搶在敵人出招前就將其拿下
Beating an enemy's move before it's even made.

307
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,660
這才是計劃
That's a plan.

308
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,580
斧頭  斧頭  瞄準尾隨我的目標
Hatchet, Hatchet, lock on my LC.

309
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,290
圖克將軍  你現在正未經許可
General Tuco, you are currently engaged

310
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,910
對美國軍事人員發動攻擊
in unauthorized warfare on United States military personnel.

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,460
滾你媽的  是你先挑起來的
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You engaged me.

312
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,000
重復一遍  
Repeat.

313
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,420
你現在正未經許可對美國軍事人員發動攻擊
You are engaged in unauthorized warfare on United States military personnel.

314

- ln other words, Adios! Mother- fu...!!  - Oh, no.

318
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,910
干得漂亮  上尉
Well done, Captain.

319
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,790
-酷斃了  -酷個屁
- That was awesome.  - That wasn't awesome.

320
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,450
-你真是個天才  -老子死也不坐飛機了  
- You are a genius!  - I'm never flying again in this thing!

321
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,250
相信你果然沒錯  頭兒
l never should have doubted you, boss!

322
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,920
凡事都在計劃之中  小子
There's a plan in everything, kid.

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,550
我就愛計劃圓滿的那一刻
And I love it when a plan comes together.

324
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,250
天龍特攻隊

325
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,250
八年

326
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,250
八十次成功任務之后

327
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,750
前線作戰基地  獵頭

328
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,750
美軍撤離伊拉克前最后的日子

329
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,330
沒有比這更好的烹飪了
Gunpowder cooking. Nothing like it.

330
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,460
小白  你想要用凝固汽油紅燒還是用原子彈油炸
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

331
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,960
原子彈油炸  
Nuke it.

332
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,540
油炸  
Nuke it!

333
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,130
默多克  他媽的給我煮熟一點
Murdock, burn the hell out of it,

334
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,300
給我狠狠地燒
like it was damned.

335
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,470
把整個地方都燒了算了  兄弟
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

336
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,850
阿帕奇   武裝偵察直升機

337
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,980
-你要私家秘調醬汁嗎  -不不不  不要防凍劑那玩意
- You want secret sauce?  - No, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

338
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,810
秘密就是  你有病  地球人都知道
The secret's out. You crazy. Everybody knows.

339
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,780
沒人能學會你的防凍腌泡汁  默多克
No one can do an anti- freeze marinade like you can, Murdock.

340
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,990
但我上次吃了以后就面癱了
But l got a little Bell's palsy last time l ate that.

341
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,490
只是局部面癱而已  來吧  有點男人樣
It's only partial paralysis. Come on, take it like a man.

342
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,280
是的  長官  正要準備和他們對話
Yes, sir. I'm having that conversation right now.

343
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,240
一定會讓他們明白的  一切都在我掌控  長官
We will enforce that. I've got it well in hand, sir.

344
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,750
我想你也不希望我局部面癱地上戰場吧
I don't think you want me to be in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

345
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,330
有客人喲
Visitors.

346
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,680
說真的  我還真吃了一驚
Wow, I'm a little taken aback. I'm not gonna lie.

347
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,640
中尉
Lieutenant.

348
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,640
很抱歉  我是不是也要叫你中尉
Oh, I'm sorry, am l supposed to call you Lieutenant back?

349
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,270
不  你得叫我上尉
No, you're supposed to call me Captain.

350
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,230
上尉 
Captain. Captain?

351
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,770
沒錯
That's right.

352
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,570
讓我想起吃的了  瞧瞧你
Captain Crunch. Look at you. Wow.

353
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,570
餐廳名

354
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,450
怪不得你不要孩子  也不要家庭
So, l guess you said no to the kids, no to the family.

355
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,320
就是要平步青云啊  
Just no ladder you can't climb, huh?

356
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,330
不  親愛的  我只是不要你而已
No, no, honey, l just said no to you.

Would you like some pork?

359
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,210
我要是把你丫手打折了  你還能再傻逼一點么
lf I broke every bone in your hand, could you still do that?

360
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,130
太不可思議了  三年了  
This is crazy. Three years?

361
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,170
我們三年沒見面了
We haven't seen each other for three years,

362
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,380
你就是來談這個的嗎
this is what we're gonna talk about?

363
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,390
那你想談什么

我那張斯蒂利·丹的CD帶來了么
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?

366
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,020
我都懶的搭理你
I'm not even going to respond to that.

367
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,190
我們一口氣聽了九遍
We listened to it, like, nine times in a row.

368
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,490
品著那難喝的解百衲葡萄酒  記得嗎
We were drinking that crappy cabernet. You remember that?

369
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,490
我們還干了點兒別的  咱干什么了
We were doing something else. What were we doing?

370
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,570
你還記得嗎  干什么了  在臥室里 
Do you remember what it was we were doing? It was in a bedroom.

371
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,990
你都忘了嗎
You don't remember?

372
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,580
我只記得我離開了你
The only thing I remember is leaving.

373
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,540
這是我對你最美好的回憶
Which is my fondest memory of you.

374
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,670
你們是最棒的  可別給我惹事
You guys are the best. Stay out of trouble, you hear me?

375
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,260
保重  謝謝
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

376
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,760
頭盔戴牢了
Keep that on.

377
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,900
上校  我叫林奇  中央情報局的
Colonel, my name is Lynch, I'm with Central lntelligence.

378
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,110
在之前第一次"沙漠風暴"行動時遇見一個中情局的人也叫林奇
l knew a company man named Lynch back in the first Desert Storm.

379
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,620
對  我們那有一堆人叫都叫這名兒
Yeah, l come from a long line of Lynches.

380
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,660
有想過人們為何不信任中情局嗎
You ever stop to consider that maybe the reason nobody trusts the CIA

381
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,870
因為沒人知道你們的真名
is because nobody knows your real names?

382
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,170
有什么可效勞的嗎  林奇先生
What can l do for you, Mr. Lynch?

383
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,670
我要你幫我阻止薩達姆的前任手下
I need you to help me to stop Saddam's former flunkies

384
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,420
在未來的30小時內竊取數十億美元
from stealing over a billion dollars in the next 30 hours.

385
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,720
現今我國境外唯一一個印制美元的鑄幣廠
Now, the only mint outside of the U.S. capable of printing our money

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,220
在伊朗境內  
belonged to the Shah of lran.

387
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,310
曾在兩伊戰爭期間失蹤
During the lran- lraq War, it went missing.

388
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,060
流言盛傳是薩達姆偷去了
Rumor was, Saddam had stolen it.

389
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,060
"沙漠風暴"時我們已經偷了回來
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

390
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,440
但是沒拿回模板
Well, you didn't get the engraving plates.

391
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,110
那不要緊
It didn't matter.

392
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,480
他們要想印鈔票就得重建鑄幣廠
They would have had to rebuild a mint just to print those bills.

393
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,070
沒錯  長官
Well, sir,

394
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,070
他們正在這么干
it's happening as we speak.

395
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,120
這群阿拉伯來的暴徒占用了廢棄的伊拉克國家鑄幣廠
Fedayeen thugs have seized what's left of the lraqi National Mint

396
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,500
印制了幾十億非法美國貨幣
to run off billions of dollars in unbacked American currency.

397
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,130
他們要如何把模板和十億美鈔
How are they planning on moving the plates and a billion dollars

398
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,460
-運出巴格達  -裝甲車
- out of Baghdad?  - Armored convoy,

399
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,090
由退伍的伊拉克特種兵駕駛
manned with former lraqi spec ops.

400
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,430
速度奇快  遇佛殺佛
You know, high speed, shoot-to-kill types.

401
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
你打算怎樣阻止他們
So how do you plan on stopping them?

402
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,560
聽著  最近有流言說薩達姆的黨羽
Listen, there's some rumors about some top-secret plates

403
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,190
要把一些高度機密的模板偷運出城
being smuggled out of the city by Saddam loyalists.

404
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,280
你聽說了嗎
Do you know anything about this?

405
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,320
你聽好了  要是你想借此事大顯身手
Seriously, if you're going to make a play for these plates,

406
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,110
我可得請你滾蛋了
I'm waving you off right now.

407
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,660
因為那是我的職責  我能搞定
'Cause it's my responsibility and it's my ass.

408
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,490
我是認真的  
I'm serious.

409
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,370
小白  
Face?

410
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,120
不然我把你告上軍事法庭
l will court-martial you.

411
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,380
-好吧  -嘿
- Whoo! Okay.  - Hey.

412
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,920
別拿我的話當耳邊風
Get the memo.

413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,340
記得告訴你家親愛的史密斯上校他媽的給我離巴格達越遠越好
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

414
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,930
你
You know,

415
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,470
你再也沒回來  我以為你會回來 
you never came back. l thought you were gonna come back.

416
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,850
我現在不是回來了么
Well, this is me, coming back.

417
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,020
你覺得那幾個小丑真敢插手
You think those clowns can really pull this off?

418
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,150
聽著  這話我從來說不出口
Listen, listen, l would never tell him this,

419
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,320
但他們確實是四個分隊里最牛逼的小組
but they are the best CIAndestine unit in the four branches,

420
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,490
而且最擅長那些不可思議的任務
and they specialize in the ridiculous...

421
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,910
我去找其他人
...shadow peck and the rest of them.

422
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,040
-給我盯緊了他們  -遵命  長官
- Do not let them out of your sight.  - Yes, ma'am.

423
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,000
"暗黑破壞神"是惡魔的意思嗎  -當然啦
- Doesn't diablo mean "devil"?  - Yeah, man.

424
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,510
去你娘的  漢尼拔  你想要我怎么樣
God damn it, Hannibal, what do you want me to do?

425
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,010
羅素·莫里森將軍

426
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,010
基地指揮官

427
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,760
如果這是我的行動    
If this were my operation and you wanted it,

428
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,970
-那你隨便插手  可這不是  -你竟讓"黑森林"執行這任務 
- you would have the mission.  - You let Black Forest deploy on this,

429
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,180
這是國際性事件  我向你保證
and it's an international incident, l promise you.

430
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,020
他們根本不算是士兵 
They're not soldiers.

431
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,770
就是群混在軍隊里的紈?子弟
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

432
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,520
-誰指揮地面部隊  -布拉德·帕克
- Who's running the ground team?  - Brock Pike.

433
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,070
帕克  
Pike.

434
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,820
他就是個搞笑的暴徒  得了吧
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character. Come on.

435
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,870
漢尼拔  我們有命令在身
Hannibal, we have been ordered, ordered, mind you,

436
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,700
明確要你別靠近巴格達  
to stay out of Baghdad.

437
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,490
-就這么定了  不得違抗  -將軍
- Cut, dried, the end.  - General,

438
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,790
我們得給他點回旋余地  您覺得呢
we should find him a little wiggle room, don't you think?

439
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,040
我還認識一個叫林奇的中情局走狗
You know, l knew another Lynch, a CIA stooge.

440
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,050
68年時駐扎在老撾
Stationed in Laos, '68.

441
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,470
-和我沒關系  -真的嗎
- No relation.  - Are you sure?

442
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,930
我一看你就想起他
'Cause you remind me of him.

443
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,180
我幾小時后得趕到喀布爾
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

444
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,310
希望我48小時后回來時已經萬事大吉
I'll be back here in 48. I'm assuming we're green and go.

445
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,230
要是干砸了別忘通知我
Notify me otherwise.

446
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,940
他在總部還穿著防彈衣
He's wearing body armor in the HQ.

447
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,230
能看出中情局的都什么貨色了吧
And that should tell you everything you need to know about the CIA.

448
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,920
老羅   現在沒其他人了  咱們談談
Russ, let's do some good on the way out the door here.

449
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,960
那些模板的危害性太大
Those plates are gonna do all kinds of damage.

450
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,510
讓我去搞定
Let me go get them.

451
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,630
算了吧  漢尼拔  這次你要置身事外
Forget about it, Hannibal. Steer clear of this one.

452
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,090
不要插手
Well clear of it.

453
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,970
這次行動是直刺薩德爾城的心臟 
This is a gauntlet run right through the heart of Sadr City.

454
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,020
薩達姆·侯賽因是個公認的瘋子
Saddam Hussein was a certifiable madman,

455
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,190
但還沒瘋狂到
but even he wasn't crazy enough

456
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,440
三十年后再去那地方
to go into that place more than once in 30 years.

457
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,530
我們一周前撤離   那里已經無法無天了
We pulled out of there a week ago and already it's the Wild West.

458
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,650
你聽上去還是很擔心的
You actually sound worried.

459
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,490
你還是生氣了
And you actually seem offended.

460
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,660
不是說你不如當年了  
Well, this isn't about you losing a step now.

461
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,080
我想你要明白這一點
l want you to know that.

462
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,080
我可比當年強大得多
I'm 10 times the man l was when you met me.

463
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,040
也迅捷得多
And twice as fast.

464
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,960
老羅
Russ,

465
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,630
我和弟兄們保證能全身而退
the boys and l can get this done, minus the bloodshed.

466
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,180
那些模板的危害性太大
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

467
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,640
別逼我求你
Don't make me beg.

468
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
我不想看到你求人
I'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

469
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,060
你和我是這么多年的老朋友
You've been my friend for a long time.

470
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,650
更重要的是  
More importantly,

471
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,610
你和那些小伙子們可能是
you and those boys have possibly been

472
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,110
我調遣過的最有價值的戰斗力
the most valuable military asset l have ever had at my disposal.

473
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,910
你請求我別逼你求我
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

474
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
但其實是我得求你
Right now, I'm begging you.

475
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,080
漢尼拔  求你了  這次你就放手吧
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

476
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,130
老羅   事關重大  不能讓那幫笨蛋上呀
Russ, this is too big an enterprise. We can't let these bozos do this.

477
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,840
事關重大呀
It's way too big.

478
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,430
你是否愿意帶著我的祝福出戰
And you'd do it with or without my blessing?

479
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,510
我不會不帶的
No, that I wouldn't.

480
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,510
我需要你的祝福
l need your blessing.

481
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,390
我不敢肯定這算不算是種祝福
I'm not so sure that it is a blessing.

482
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,690
祝你馬到功成  伙計  
Good hunting, my friend.

483
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
謝謝
Thank you.

484
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,570
和老家伙談的如何
How'd it go with the old man?

485
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,200
都是些陳詞濫調   你手上是什么
Same old, same old. What you got there?

486
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,990
我的新歡
Pictures of my new baby.

487
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,750
不錯呀  眼光不賴
Oh, look at her. Who's a proud papa?

488
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,790
這些是默多克近距離拍下的
These pictures are the closest Murdock gets to that van.

489
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,500
等我回到洛杉磯  它就會在那兒等我了
It's ready for me when I go back to LA.

490
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,920
聽著  怪頭  我們得多待一陣子了
Listen, B.A., we're extending our stay a little bit.

491
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,430
得回巴格達去
We're going back into Baghdad.

492
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,510
上頭不是命令咱別去巴格達嗎
l thought we was ordered to stay out of Baghdad.

493
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,260
-沒錯  可我   -史密斯
- That's true, but I'm...  - Smith.

494
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,140
-帕克  -我聽說你和你手下
- Pike.  - l understand you and your grunts

495
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,440
要搶我飯碗  我可不太高興
are now stealing my gigs. l don't like that.

496
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,690
我以為你們"黑森林"大軍忙著
I figured you Black Forest guys would be busy

497
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,940
在哪搞獨裁或推翻民主呢
installing a dictatorship or overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

498
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,740
現在是周末  那些事得上班時間處理  大叔
It's still the weekend, yet. That's nine-to-five stuff, pops.

499
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
看看你們這群小丑
Look at you clowns.

500
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,700
你們算哪門子士兵
You're not soldiers.

501
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,580
簡直就是穿著馬球衫的刺客
You're assassins in polo shirts.

502
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,960
你們折騰一年的活兒  我們一周就能拿下
We'll make in a week what you guys make in a year.

503
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,750
鈔票買不來勇氣  小子
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

504
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,460
也買不來智慧
or brains.

505
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,680
可惜你兩樣都缺
And you're short on both.

506
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,100
這是莫里森的基地  趕緊滾出我的地盤
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

507
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,560
怪頭  你都穿上黃色領騎衫了呀  
They make you wear the yellow shirt there, B.A.?

508
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,770
你名字是啥意思   廢物的意思嗎
What's that stand for, "Barely Able"?

509
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,740
讓開  廢物
Get out of my way, punk.

510
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,820
別怕他們
Hey, don't sweat them.

511
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,950
他們可幫我們大忙了
They might have just done us a favor. A big one.

512
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,700
看   只剩一輛中型坦克了
Let me see, we got one medium tank left.

513
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,960
我跟你說  她不會平白無故地回來
I'm telling you, there's a reason she came back.

514
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,370
小白  我都說了  忘了她
Face, l told you, forget about her.

515
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,880
這女人的野心簡直 
The levels of ambition on this woman...

516
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,880
打死我也不坐飛機了  漢尼拔
I ain't stepping foot in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

517
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,090
不論是滑翔機  紙飛機  還是輕型機
No gliders, paper planes, ultra-lights.

518
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,090
-你就是揪著這事兒不放吧  -沒錯
- You ever gonna let me live that down?  - No.

519
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,220
墨西哥那都多久前的事了  我還救了你的命
Mexico was a long time ago, and l saved your life.

520
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,390
那你怎么不謝我在醫院里沒揍爛你菊花
How about thanking me for not whooping your ass at the hospital?

521
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,970
沒遇見你之前我是空降兵
l was an Airborne Ranger until l met you.

522
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,600
可你嚇得跟什么似的  
And you chickened out just like...

523
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,100
-263次跳傘  -你就不能謝謝我嗎
- 263 jumps.  - Just a thank-you would have been nice.

524
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,270
可坐過一次你開的直升機后全毀了
And one helicopter ride with you screws it up.

525
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
空降兵卻恐飛  就是個棒槌
Airborne Ranger with a fear of flying. Like a punk!

526
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,360
怪頭  我保證  咱搶過卡車
B.A., for the last time, nobody leaves the truck

527
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,530
后就都在里面呆著  好吧
once we take it over. Okay?

528
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,950
我老表帶我來到這個派對  在那里有個超棒的伴奏樂隊
My cousin takes me to this party where this amazing cover band

529
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,910
演奏了鞭撻金屬版的萊昂納爾·里奇的懷舊金曲
does this trash metal version of Hello by Lionel Richie.

530
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,040
-哦  -唱起來就像這樣
-Yeah. -Yeah. It goes...

531
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,590
嗨  你是在找我嗎
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

532
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,250
伙計們   他們在里面多久了
Guys, how long have they been in there?

533
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,340
-三小時了  -三小時
- About three hours. - Three hours.

534
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,420
三小時
Three hours?

535
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,260
在里頭三小時了  沒出來嗎
They've been in there for three hours? They haven't come out at all?

536
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,720
都沒人出來尿尿或其他什么的嗎
No one came out to take a leak, nothing?

537
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,310
一個也沒
- No.  - Nope.

538
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,100
我站這兒才一會兒就已經感覺不對了
I've been here for three seconds and that sounds odd to me.

539
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,020
我就像獵鷹般的盯著他們
I've been watching that tent like a hawk.

540
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,190
是嗎  我怎么看到你們只是坐這兒吃意大利肉汁燴飯
Really? lt looks like you're eating some risotto and sitting on your ass.

541
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,610
我不知道了  我想來點湯
I don't know. I wanted the soup.

542
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,950
-我吃的不是意大利肉汁燴飯  -真不是
- I wasn't eating risotto. I had... -It's not risotto.

543
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,540
伙計們
Yeah, boys.

544
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,630
他想挑事呀
Yeah, he wants to fight, doesn't he?

545
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,800
靠這也太爽了  還給我們找了跳脫衣舞的妞呀 
Damn, this is awesome. They got us a stripper, too.

546
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,720
你眼神就像我們當兵的一樣性感  比如說我
You got that hot enlisted look. Me likey.

547
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,560
在我關你們禁閉之前  我想知道  他們哪去了
Before l throw you in the stockade, where are they?

548
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,190
沒跟我們說哦  上尉
They didn't tell us... Captain.

549
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,150
只給了我們一箱啤酒和每人五十塊
They just gave us a case of beer and 50 bucks apiece.

550
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,860
給我的是一百
I got a hundred.

551
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,650
給你的是一百塊呀
Oh, did you get a hundred?

552
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,660
這假發是不是歸咱們了
You think we get to keep the hair?

553
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,580
策劃  行動  部署
Staging, movement, action plan.

554
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,580
你們有得讀了
There's a nice read for you.

555
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,800
太給力了  漢尼拔  要的就是這個
Hell, yeah, Hannibal. This is it right here.

556
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,880
讓人難以置信
This is bat-shit insane.

557
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,260
-完美  -頭兒  太瘋狂了
- It's perfect.  - This is beyond nuts, boss.

558
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,560
習慣就好
It gets better.

559
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,690
怪頭  你去找一塊和你塊頭差不多大的金屬做滑板
B.A., you'll need a piece of contoured metal to make a skid plate.

560
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,820
快走  傻瓜
Let's go, fool.

561
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,440
默多克  去弄塊車用電池
Murdock, we'll need a car battery, too.

562
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,160
看看"黑森林"那群傻帽那邊有不
See if the boys at Black Forest can help us out.

563
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,870
我們還需要記者證
Press credentials, we need them.

564
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,450
到媒體中心的帳篷里去找找
Hit the media tent and see what's lying around.

565
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,750
抱歉  伙計  我看你
Sorry, my friend, l see you've put

566
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,580
剛把南非電視臺的話筒放下邊了
the South African microphone at the bottom.

567
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,790
你不能總讓CNN高高在上
You can't always put the CNN on top.

568
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,090
當兵的  這兒有兩個話筒  我不清楚是
Private, there are two mics. I don't know if there is something...

569
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,680
早先我曾是個帥小伙
I was a moving man in my younger days

570
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,050
默多克  我們得弄臺新聞攝影機
Murdock, we need a news camera.

571
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,640
就看你的了
See what you can do.

572
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,640
抱歉  抱歉
All right, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

573
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,310
你好  我
Hello. I'm...

574
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,310
我愛上你了
I'm in love with you.

575
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,940
聽著  我們正在做預備性會談  
Listen, we're doing a preliminary poll of...

576
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,320
是關于那個什么  對了  撤軍
What are we talking about? Of the pull-out.

577
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,320
還需要氣囊  越多越好
We're gonna need airbags, lots of them.

578
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,740
-你是哪個部門的  -法國世界報
- What bureau are you with, darling?  - Le Monde.

579
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,240
你是法國人
Are you French?

580
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,480
你好  我是帕克爾將軍  我需要
Hello, this is General Parker. I need...

581
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
找你的
Okay. It's for you.

582
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,800
要進行空襲  你自己去和上頭說
Hey, fool, you need to call an air strike on yourself.

583
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,430
-我們這沒問題了  老兄  再會  -不  我們得回去 
- We're good, mate. I'll meet you.  - No, I think we need to get going now.

584
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,680
你給我聽清楚了
You need to understand what I'm telling you right now.

585
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,260
怪頭  弄塊磁鐵
B.A., we're gonna need a magnet.

586
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,350
要磁力夠強的
A powerful one.

587
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,690
看過藍人樂隊的演出嗎
You ever seen Blue Man Group?

588
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,190
其他的交給我
I'll pick up the rest.

589
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,040
我想冒次險
I'm just gonna go for it.

590
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,050
你愿意付出一切  換取這個機會嗎
What would you give for one chance

591
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,720
那就是回來大聲告訴我們的敵人
to come back here and tell our enemies

592
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,390
他們也許能奪走我們的生命 
that they may take our lives,

593
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,560
卻永遠奪不走我們的自由 
but they'll never take our freedom!

594
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,560
惡搞《勇敢的心》

595
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,560
準備好進城了嗎  
Ready to go downtown?

596
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,900
祝君好運
Good luck.

597
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
-謝謝  -讓他們見鬼去吧
- Thank you.  - Give 'em hell.

598
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,750
莫里森將軍  漢尼拔·史密斯在他媽哪兒呀
General Morrison, where the hell is Hannibal Smith?

599
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,840
上尉   和首長說話要禮貌
Captain, you would do well to revise your tone and readdress me.

600
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,590
將軍  我奉命可以隨時取代你
General, I have authority under DClS that supersedes your command,

601
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,720
為免難堪  我最后再問你一次  
so last time, before this becomes embarrassing for the both of us,

602
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,390
漢尼拔在哪兒
where is Hannibal Smith?

603
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,270
你先出去下  將軍
Would you excuse us, General?

604
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,360
上尉  我從軍快四十年了
Captain, in nearly 40 years of being in this army,

605
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,780
已經不是剛當兵時的火爆脾氣了
I have learned to control my temper

606
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,200
特別是對待下屬時我更會和和氣氣
and my voice when in the presence of a subordinate officer

607
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,290
現在到底是誰他媽的說話這么不客氣
who, for at least the time being, seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

608
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,290
我理解是
Now, it is my understanding

609
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,300
你有事要問我  對吧
that you have a question for me. ls that correct?

610
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,880
是的
You are correct, sir.

611
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,130
你要記住  你還是一名美國軍官
Then when you are prepared to remember that you are still an officer

612
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,890
盡管你現在沒穿著軍裝
in the United States Army, in spite of your civilian attire,

613
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,890
當兵的就要有當兵的樣
and are ready to present that question in a military fashion,

614
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,100
這樣我們才能談的下去
then perhaps we could get somewhere with this discussion.

615
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,230
如果你派遣天龍特攻隊去了巴格達
lf you have sent an Alpha Team into Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

616
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,610
就已經違抗了國防部的命令 
that is a direct violation of a DoD order.

617
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,360
既然你都這么說了
Well, and as much as you have this kind of knowledge,

618
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,950
還問我作甚
I can't help wondering why it is that you need to ask anything of me.

619
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,870
我就當你是承認了
I will take that as your confirmation, sir.

620
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,050
他們三小時后出發
They go mobile in three hours.

621
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,930
在鑄幣廠里將模板和十多億美元
The plates and over a billion dollars

622
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,680
裝在一輛拖車后面
will be loaded into the back of a semi at the mint.

623
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,310
然后行駛7.4公里到達這座橋
They're overland for exactly 4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

624
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,730
這是我們的機會  但轉瞬即逝
That's our window, and it closes fast.

625
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,530
一有任何風吹草動  他們都會開大火力
These guys will go weapons hot at the first whisper of trouble.

626
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,710
小白  你得進入酒店地下
Face, your point of entry is under the hotel.

627
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,050
酒店上面肯定擠滿了外國記者和私人保鏢
It'll be packed with foreign press and private security.

628
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,780
怪頭  你帶著計時器等在這條巷子里
B.A., you're in this alleyway on a stopwatch.

629
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,360
車起碼要是雙氣缸引擎
Make sure the bike has V-tins or better.

630
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,740
我弄了輛比那強百倍的
I got something a whole lot better than that.

631
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,240
我干什么呀  頭兒
What about me, boss man?

632
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,750
我有架小型直升機
I had a little helicopter here someplace.

633
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,790
能不能空翻  或是空中熄火
You got some barrel rolls? Some mid-air stalls?

634
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,170
我等不及下一次瀕死體驗了
I'm looking for my next near-death experience.

635
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,180
你這次是支援行動  上尉  
Only air support this time, Captain,

636
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,680
下次會讓你大干一場  我保證
but I'll get you in on the next one. I promise.

637
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,270
怪頭  你六點半準時出發
B.A., I need you to pop that clutch at 0630.

638
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,600
我嗎
Is that me?

639
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,320
我都忘了  我在伊拉克的下水道里  太謝謝了  頭兒
Oh, no, l forgot. I'm in an lraqi sewer. Thanks, boss!

640
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,280
時間就是一切  小白
Timing is everything, Face.

641
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,450
關鍵要一擊即中
This is all about the bull's-eyes.

642
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,170
誰說不是
Why not?

643
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,550
在拖車下面  你得把跟在后面的卡車干掉
From under the semi, you'll take out the truck directly behind you.

644
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,770
然后會有人沖著你過來  小白
Now, these guys are gonna be onto you, Face.

645
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,610
怪頭  這時就該你上場了
B.A., that's your cue for throttle.

646
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,740
穿越前先看清兩旁的路
Be sure to look both ways before crossing.

647
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,820
還有別忘了給車加滿油
And have a nice full tank of gas.

648
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,830
車上會有重兵把守  怪頭
You'll have multiple hostiles on board, B.A.

649
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,420
把他們統統解決掉
Escort them from the premises.

650
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,740
要是有人從后面偷襲  別擔心  有我呢
If any stragglers sneak up behind, don't worry, l got your back.

651
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,670
抓住你了  小子
Gotcha, kid.

652
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,920
好樣的
Attaboy.

653
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,430
聽起來不錯  但我們要怎么離開巴格達呢
That's all fine in theory, but I still don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

654
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,510
我心中有數
I do.

655
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,550
怪頭  右轉  
B.A.! Hang a right!

656
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,890
好的  抓緊
All right! Hang on!

657
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
-小心  -低頭
- Watch out! Watch out!   - Heads down!

658
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,820
干得漂亮  怪頭
Oh! Nice one, B.A. !

659
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,150
小白  裝上氣囊
Face, get the airbags!

660
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,620
得保證一會兒不會脫落
Gotta make sure this thing stays locked for later!

661
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
完美
Beautiful!

662
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,080
一  二  三
One, two, three.

663
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,420
頭兒  氣囊是為了防撞擊的吧
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy on impact, right?

664
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,090
怪頭  到集裝箱里去
B.A., get in the container.

665
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,640
注意后方
Contact, rear!

666
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,220
靠
Shit!

667
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,030
我就覺得這部分最不靠譜
See, this is the part of the plan l don't trust!

668
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,530
別擔心  小白  繩子很牢
Don't worry, Face! The rope will hold!

669
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,620
我擔心會被釘在集裝箱上
If l was worried, l'd be nailing myself to the container right now!

670
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,460
抓住了  弟兄們
Hang on, boys!

671
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,400
老子來也  統統給我轟成渣吧
Bam! Come on! l smoked you!

672
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,060
你們看到下面的情況了沒
You boys see that down there?

673
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,360
那傻蛋來干什么  
Murdock? What is that fool doing here?

674
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,360
讓我出去  我不是開玩笑
Don't lock me in here. l ain't playing with y'all!

675
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,650
頭兒  你有沒有在游戲廳玩過
Hey, boss, you ever play that game at the fun fair

676
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,950
用爪子抓玩具的游戲
where you try to pick up a stuffed animal with the claw?

677
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,490
這感覺太像啦
This is a lot like that.

678
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,540
就是這樣
That's it!

679
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,370
你們鎖上了是么 
Did you lock this?

680
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,830
你們鎖上了是么  你們竟然我把鎖住了
You locked it, didn't you?

681
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,670
漢尼拔  快開門呀  伙計
Hannibal, open this door right now, man!

682
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,960
你是在把這車廂往哪兒掛嗎
What the... Are you hooking this thing?

683
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,090
-是往直升機上掛嗎  -掛好了
- You hooking this up to a helicopter?   - I got you.

684
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,260
到底他媽怎么回事  別這么瘋狂
What the hell's going on?   You ain't that crazy!

685
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,470
別他媽告我現在我在天上  看我怎么弄死你們 
Tell me we ain't flying! I'm gonna kill you, fool!

686
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,470
-頭兒  那是博斯克嗎  -快放我出去 
- Boss, is that Bosco?  - Get me out of here!

687
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,470
-糟了  -快放我出去  
- That's not good.  - Let me out of here!

688
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,470
這下糟了  他不高興了
That's not good. He is not happy.

689
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,850
林奇特工  我臨時從
Agent Lynch, I'm patching surveillance

將軍賬營中打給你

691
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,520
長官  現在有架可傾斜旋翼的V22型飛機
Sir, l have an inbound V-22 tilt-rotor

692
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,110
從西北方向接近

是友非敵  奉將軍之命在此降落
Identified friendly. Landing under the General's orders.

694
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,740
是天龍特攻隊撤退至此  不是敵人   
Alpha Delta Alpha, stand down. Checked, friendly.

695
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,290
喀布爾  阿富汗

696
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,790
是我們的人  在臨時著陸區的D區
Those are our boys. D-block perimeter around LZ

697
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,000
攜帶重要物品降落
for essential cargo touchdown.

698
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,730
老羅  大獲全勝
Russ, we are in the net.

699
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,940
收到  我五分鐘后到 
Copy that. l will be there in five.

700
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,360
用一大瓶尊尼獲加藍方為你們接風
I've got a big bottle of Blue Label waiting.

701
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,240
一瓶哪夠  最起碼一箱才行  吝嗇鬼
A bottle? Make it a case, Scrooge.

702
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,780
一會兒見
See you in a few.

703
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,950
誰去放他出來
Who's gonna let him out?

704
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,500
-你去  -你去
- You!  - You!

705
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,130
你們都小心著點  等我出去搞死你們
What you don't realize is, now l gotta kill all of y'all!

706
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,840
丫的搞死你們  先滅漢尼拔  然后是默多克
I'll kill all of y'all! Hannibal first, then Murdock!

707
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,800
-頭兒  -最后是小白
- Boss man.  - I'm gonna save Face for last!

708
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,590
-讓我試試  -去吧
- Let me try something.  - Go for it.

709
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,090
真是詭異  我覺得他比那任務還可怕
ls it weird that I'm more scared now than what we just did?

710
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,390
博斯克  我是默多克
Bosco, it's Murdock.

711
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,180
默多克  快開門 
Murdock, open this door!

712
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,730
乖  我給你做你愛吃的椰奶咖喱橄欖沙司喲
I'll make you some of that coconut-curry tapenade that you love.

713
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,480
這招估計管用
That might work.

714
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,480
有吐司嗎  
With toast points?

715
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,610
當然有吐司  不然
Hell, yeah, with toast points. What, you're gonna have that

716
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,360
要抹在土豆餅上吃嗎 
with plain old chips?

717
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,450
-你玩兒我  -猛虎出柵嘍
- Damn! You tricked me.  - There he is.

718

00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,280
-得了  -離我遠點  伙計
- Come on!  - Get away from me, man!

720
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,120
要不是寡不敵眾我真想揍扁你們
The only reason l don't kick y'all asses is 'cause you all outrank me.

721
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,040
你搞明白點  我討厭在天上飛
You should know better! You know l hate flying!

722
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,290
我滿身是汗  臭氣熏天  
I'm wet! I stink!

723
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,830
我還一毛錢都花不了
And l can't spend none of that money!

724
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,790
-用錢買不來幸福  -去你丫的
- Money can't buy happiness.  - Damn, man!

725
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,170
默多克  今晚你來做飯  穿上你的小花圍裙
Hey, Murdock, you cooking tonight. You better get your apron on.

726
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,470
我就愛計劃圓滿的那一刻
I love it when a plan comes together.

727
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,770
-漢尼拔  誰在里面  -是將軍嗎
- Hannibal, who was that?  - General?

728
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,190
-里面是將軍嗎  -老羅
- ls that the General?  - Russ.

729
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,730
-到這兒來  -將軍 
- Get there. Get in there.  -  General!

730
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,820
-老羅  -將軍  
- Russ!  - General!

731
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,530
將軍 
General!

732
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,150
天哪
Jesus Christ.

733
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,410
帕克
Pike.

734
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,040
注意后方
Contact rear!

735
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,330
過去
Get in there!

736
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,250
快過去
Get there, get there!

737
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,150
經過商議  我們決定將你
After conferring, we've decided to demote you

738
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,730
降級到中尉
to the rank of First Lieutenant.

739
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,610
索薩中尉  雖不是你的過失  
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing personal,

740
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,400
但你卻沒能弄回模板
but you lost those plates.

741
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,530
那便是你的責任
Those were your responsibility.

742
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,330
你就慶幸吧
Consider yourself lucky.

743
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,830
其他人要為此去蹲監獄
Others are going to prison over this.

744
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,370
您好  麥克雷迪檢察官
Good day, Director McCready.

745
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,330
中尉  你可以走了
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

746
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,880
史密斯上校  本庭無法證實
Colonel Smith, this court has been unable to recover

747
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,250
你執行的那項任務是遵從
any direct order from General Morrison for you to conduct the mission

748
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,340
莫里森將軍的命令
for which you're being tried.

749
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,800
法官大人  這是秘密行動
Your Honor, this was a covert operation

750
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,220
并無官方命令
and no official orders were given.

751
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,930
但唯一能證明此項行動合法性的人
So the one individual who can verify

752
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,770
已經去世了  對吧  上校
the legitimacy of this operation is deceased. Is that correct, Colonel?

753
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,900
不對  法官大人  不是去世
No, Your Honor, not deceased.

754
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,690
羅素·莫里森將軍

755
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,690
美國陸軍

756
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,190
莫里森將軍是被謀殺的
General Morrison was murdered.

757
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,780
上校  像你們這種不守軍規的人
Colonel, I've been around a long time.

758
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,780
我見的多了
I've seen units like yours. They're outlaws.

759
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,530
就是你們這種人
Units like that pose a direct threat

760
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,080
對我軍的軍威軍紀造成了巨大威脅
to the fabric and fundamentals of our military.

761
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,330
法官大人  為何"黑森林"沒有被問責
Your Honors, why hasn't Black Forest been brought to trial?

762
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,300
黑森林及其成員不在我們的管轄范圍內
Black Forest and its personnel are not subject to military jurisdiction.

763
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,840
你的計劃呢  頭兒  
Where's the plan, boss? Where is it?

764
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,760
逃跑計劃呢  我沒看到呢
Where's the escape hatch? Because l don't see it.

765
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,350
-這項任務還沒結束  中尉  -什么任務
- This mission isn't over, Lieutenant.  - What mission?

766
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,230
找到帕克和模板  就能洗清罪名
I clear our names. We find Pike and the plates.

767
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,190
不惜一切代價
No matter what.

768
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,360
法官大人  這些人只是依令辦事
Your Honors, these men were acting under my command.

769
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,240
所有處罰都應由我一人承擔
Any judgment should be levied against me, and me alone.

770
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,490
并非如此  長官 
Absolutely not, sir.

771
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,740
我們都是自愿參與此行動
We were all participating in this operation willingly.

772
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,990
我不贊成個人頂責 
I don't wanna be tried separately.

773
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,660
我也拒絕個人頂責  長官
I refuse to be tried separately, sir.

774
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,910
根據軍事審判統一法典
In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

775
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,790
本庭判決A小隊  即天龍特攻隊
this court is rendering guilty verdicts

776
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,290
所有成員罪名成立
for each member of this Alpha Unit, or A-Team,

777
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,400
并委托監獄對你們分開進行最嚴密監禁
and mandating incarceration in separate maximum-security facilities

778
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,170
在未來十年內 
for a period of up to 10 years.

779
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,800
撤銷你們的軍銜
You're all hereby stripped of formal rank

780
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,180
并開除軍籍  永不錄用
and dishonorably discharged.

781
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,390
簡直是放屁
This is bullshit, man.

782
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,190
現在休庭
This session is adjourned.

783
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,740
可恥
Disgraceful.

784
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,030
-別碰我  -上尉  退下
- Do not touch me, okay?  - Captain, stand down.

785
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,660
安靜
Order! Order!

786
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,950
絕對的誣陷 
Absolute disgrace!

787
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,200
你高興了吧  查瑞莎
You happy? Are you happy, Charissa?

788
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,870
上校  管好你的人
Colonel, control your men!

789
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,870
-把你的手拿開  -這是誣陷
- Get your hands off me!  - This is a disgrace!

790
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,870
六個月后

791
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
軍 事 監 獄

792
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,000
科羅拉多

793
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,000
卡森要塞

794
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,400
好久不見  林奇先生
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch. Long time.

795
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,900
在這么多攝像頭下  
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

796
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,490
你還能這樣放松
A lot of cameras in here.

797
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,280
確實挺多
Yeah, there are.

798
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,030
但現在它們都有些技術故障
Yeah, well, they seem to be having some technical issues at the moment.

799
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,660
看來錄像里是找不到我了  
May not show up till playback.

800
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,910
漢尼拔  能這么稱呼你嗎
Hannibal. Can l call you Hannibal?

801
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,330
不能再叫你上校了
I can't call you Colonel anymore.

802
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,920
我等了
Six months.

803
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,380
你六個月  等著你把這兒炸飛
Been waiting for you to bust out of here

804
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,470
再召回那幫小兄弟
and round up the rest of the Backstreet Boys

805
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,010
帶我去找模板
and lead me to those plates.

806
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,010
但六個月卻毫無音訊
Six months and not a peep.

807
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,980
所有人都以為你們是和帕克一伙兒的
Everybody thought you and your team were working with Pike.

808
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,690
除了你  
Mmm. Everybody except you.

809
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,990
帕克謀殺了莫里森  設計陷害我們  偷走了模板
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me and my boys up and stole those plates.

810
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,330
我知道他在哪兒
And I know where he is.

811
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,160
沒人知道他在哪兒
Nobody knows where he is.

812
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,880
這有一張他被拍到的照片
It's a single image of him.

813
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,550
一個月前在歐洲的某處
Taken about a month ago, somewhere in Europe.

814
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,130
大概是監控攝像頭的抓拍
We think it's a grab from a CCTV camera.

815
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,100
是德國的法蘭克福
Frankfurt, Germany.

816
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,430
你怎么知道 
How did you get that in here?

817
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,310
我需要的只是時間  林奇
Time, Lynch.

818
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,610
1分鐘我就能做到這樣  
Give me a minute and I'm good.

819
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,570
給1小時我會更出色
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

820
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,820
要是給我半年時間  我就無敵了
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

821
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,490
帕克我認識  
I know Pike.

822
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,780
那個阿拉伯人是誰
Who's the Arab?

823
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,910
不知道
We don't know.

824
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,080
我們覺得他是"深黑"  整個事件的幕后黑手
We think he's the deep, dark, hidden hand in this whole thing.

825
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,000
或是經紀人  或是買主
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

826
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,340
林奇  我們有共同的敵人  而你卻只有一個選擇
Lynch, we have common enemies and you have limited choices.

827
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,050
我的隊伍是你奪回模板的最好選擇
My team is still your best shot at getting those plates back.

828
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,380
這我得想一想  
I wouldn't be so sure.

829
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,880
那你干嗎大老遠跑到這兒來
Then why did you make the long drive out here?

830
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,760
你和中情局的伙計們正等著你的決定
You and your boys at Langley want your own private printing press.

831
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,350
行不行就取決于你的愛國心了
That's about as deep as your patriotism goes.

832
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,890
那你需要我如何協助
So, what would you need from me?

833
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,940
我答應過隊員們會為他們洗清罪名
I swore to my team that I would clear our names.

834
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,860
你們都該明白名譽的重要性
You of all people must understand the value of a name.

835
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,530
聽著  
Now, listen.

836
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,740
我要求復職與洗清罪名
I want full reinstatement and clean records

837
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,490
我和我的隊員們
for myself and my team.

838
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,830
我無法把你弄出去  
I can't get you out of here.

839
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,790
至少合法的途徑上不行
Not legally, at least.

840
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,500
這是中情局的拿手菜
This is something the boys at Langley do very, very well.

841
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,000
浸5毫升河豚毒素的古巴雪茄

842
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,260
劑量一定要準確
Make sure the dosage is right.

843
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,510
準確的意思就是毫厘不差
And when I say right, I mean perfect.

844
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,350
我的幸福鳥呀她還沒來到
Don't seem like happiness will come along

845
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,690
古巴貨 可惜了
Cuban. What a shame.

846
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,610
大家都往我床上丟石塊
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed

847
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,320
生活停滯不前
Just can't seem to get ahead in life

848
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,000
火葬室

849
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:52,910
為啥我就搞不定
Ooh, nothing I do ever turn out right

850
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
"戰神"  約翰·史密斯  被捕后死于心臟病

851
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,170
為啥沒人來幫幫我
Won't somebody help me, please?

852
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,260
我已寂寞很久了
'Cause I've been lonely for so long

853
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,050
我的幸福鳥呀她還沒來到
Don't seem like happiness will come along

854
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,890
我已寂寞
I've been lonely...

855
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,370
休想在我的 
You are not permitted

856
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,790
道場撒野
in my dojo!

857
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,380
看來  撒旦顯靈了
So, Satan walks into this bar...

858
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,510
等等  這都什么  泳池  
Wait a minute. What's this, a lap pool?

859
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,970
蒸汽房
A dry steam room?

860
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,590
是啊  還要用很久呢
Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.

861
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,510
你到底怎么弄來的
How in the hell do you pull this off?

862
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,060
這不在于和誰關系好  鮑勃  而在于你們關系有多好
It's not who you know, Bob, it's how you know them.

863
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,060

你兒子從阿富汗回來了嗎
Oh! Did your boy get back from Afghanistan?

867
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,770
對  多虧回來了  我和孩他媽都高興的不得了
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home. His mother and l are real grateful.

868
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,650
上尉 
Captain.

869
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,570
你忘東西在我床上了
You left something on the bed.

870
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,950
-你應該藏起來  -藏起來多浪費
- Could have hid those.  - Why would I want to do that?

871
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,950
太銷魂了  八點見  
Drive me crazy. I'll see you at 8:00.

872
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,210
-你還要建什么  -泳池和蒸汽房已經有了
-And now you want to build...  -A lap pool and a dry steam.

對了  還要一個日光浴場所
Overlooking a sundeck.

謝謝你的靴子 
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

875

客氣啥  我的榮幸  寶貝兒
Ah! Come on. It's my pleasure, baby!

876
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,940
漂亮
Beautiful.

877
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,200
聽著  我知道這對身體有好處
Listen, now l know this is good for the body,

878
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,990
但怎樣保護臉不被曬傷
but how do you protect the face?

879
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,620
小子  你的臉再黑也很帥
You don't mess with it, kid.

880
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200

Gotcha.

881

-謝謝請我做日光浴  -不客氣
- Thanks for the tan. - You got it.

882
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,420
史密斯越獄了  中尉
Smith has escaped, Lieutenant.

883
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,800
我去抓他回來
Let me go after him.

884
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,640
史密斯他們和布拉德·帕克的黑森林勾結
Smith and his team were working with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

885
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,970
找到他們就能找回模板  長官
I can get those plates back for you, sir.

886
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,060
相信我
You know I can.

887
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,270
哼哼哈嘿
Holla what? Holla who?

888

哼哼哈
Holla me.

889
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,910
放我出去
Hey! Let me out! Hey, hey! Hey!

890
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,950
我當時就看到他站在那兒  我都傻了  我還以為是鬼
I see him standing there, and I was like, "What?"

891
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:43,330
他全身烏黑  等我醒來   臉上還很麻木
And then it turned black and I woke up, and my face was numb,

892
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,880
我就
and l just...

893
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,340
你就把他的腳印都用拖把擦了
And you mopped up the footprints that led out,

894
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,670
連你的實驗大褂丟了也沒發覺
ignored the fact that your lab coat,

895
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,720
還有通行證  車鑰匙和你的車
pass card, car keys and car were missing.

896
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,430
胖得好像吞了史密斯在肚中
Looks like he ate Smith.

897
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,510
吉伯特  你或者蓄意
Gilbert, you've either deliberately

898
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,270
與一名聯邦罪犯策劃越獄 
aided and abetted a federal fugitive's escape,

899
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,270
或者就是你笨得可以
or you're the single dumbest human being I've ever come into contact with.

900
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,440
-你聞到了嗎   -啥也別說
- You smell that?   - Don't talk about it.

901
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,860
你想知道為啥我要傾著身子嗎
Would you like to know which way I'm leaning?

902
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,910
前鋒的職業病
Forward.

903
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,410
每小時給這家伙做一次尿檢
I would test this man's urine, on the hour.

904
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,680
距離我的假釋聽證會就差一周啊  
I was a week away from my parole hearing.

905
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,100
你曬得還真黑啊
You are really tan.

906
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,480
跟你說過了這任務還沒完
Told you the mission wasn't over.

907
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,780
我要重組天龍特攻隊
I'm putting the team back together.

908
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,860
天龍特攻隊不能沒有你  小白
I need you, Face. I can't do this without you.

909
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,990
獄長  為啥有人可以不經你同意去探望史密斯
Warden, how did Smith arrange a personal visit without your consent

910
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,660
你也沒簽字通過呀  這咋就發生了
or your signature? How does that happen?

911
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,410
這該死的家伙怎么辦到的
How the hell did this guy do that?

912
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,920
封鎖起來  誰都不許進去
Seal that up, nobody goes in there.

913
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,920
沒有探監那天的登記記錄
Log-in pages from the day in question have been removed.

914
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,550
-意料之中  -被撕掉了
- Why does that not surprise me?  - Torn out.

915
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,600
雪茄藏在那本書的書脊里
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

916
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,100
-真精密  這書不錯  -不錯
- Subtle. It's a good book.  - Right.

917
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,890
這是全方位監視犯人的攝像錄像
This is surveillance from all around the prison, right?

918
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,730
而屏幕上出現的扭曲是信號干擾 
What you're watching is a signal jammer.

919
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,940
每當他路過這些探頭時
Every time he walks through one of these things,

920
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,820
一拍到他的攝像頭都會受到信號干擾
we get massive interference. He waltzes in here and waltzes out.

921
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,740
沒人知道他是誰
Nobody knows who he is.

922
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,200
天呀
God.

923
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,490
哦  這就是那根幫助史密斯上校越獄的雪茄
Yes. The cigar that Colonel Smith broke out of prison with.

924
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,500
-知道比這更不可思議的是什么嗎   -是什么
- Yeah. Wanna hear the crazy part?  - Yes.

925
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,920
實驗檢測到這里面含有足以致命劑量的河豚毒素 
Lab reports show lethal amounts of, wait for it, tetrodotoxin.

926
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,130
河豚毒素   那是什么
Tetrodotoxin? What is that?

927
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,220
-可以瀕死的藥物  -能讓人成為睡美人的玩意
-The near-death drug. -Yes, that sleeping beauty thing.

928
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,260
你知道什么人會用這玩意嗎
Yeah. And you know who likes to use that, right?

929
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,590
-誰  -名字都叫林某某的那些人
-Who? -Our friends at Langley.

930
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,720
這是他們的拿手好戲
It's one of their favorites.

931
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,770
你覺得是中情局的人來找的史密斯嗎
Come on, do you really think that the CIA came to the prison to visit Smith?

932
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,730
雖然有些離譜  但我覺得是中情局幫他越獄的
This sounds kind of crazy, but l think the CIA broke him out.

933
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,020
誰幫的忙
Who put us on?

934
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,570
就是在巴格達的那個人  中情局的林奇
The same guy that put us on in Baghdad. Lynch, CIA.

935
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,450
為了什么  洗清罪名嗎  還是復職
What are we talking about? Clean records? Reinstatements?

936
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,200
都是
All of the above.

937
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,200
那帕克呢  還有模板
What about Pike and the plates?

938
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,040
要他們付出代價
Payback.

939
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,080
他們在交換什么  在做什么
What are they exchanging?  What is that?

940
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,590
他就是這樣進來的嗎
Is that how he got this in here?

941
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,180
找找兩張圖中的不圖之處
One of these things is not like the other.

942
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,430
這種游戲我可不在行
I suck at these games.

943
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,640
模板從哪座樓里帶出來的  模板上倒映的是什么
Where's this plate from? What is that plate?

944
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,890
字母F  德國法蘭克福 
It's an "F." Frankfurt, Germany.

945
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,020
哦  德國法蘭克福 
Oh, Frankfurt, Germany.

946
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,940
史密斯在向我們暗示什么  這不會是巧合
Smith is talking to us. This is not accidental.

947
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,980
這家伙總是胸有成竹  
With this guy, there's a plan and two to back it up.

948
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,150
你不是指什么因果報應吧
l take it you didn't get religion inside.

949
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,070
不  是復仇
No. l got revenge.

950
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,490
很好
Good.

951
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,870
我認識幾個人  剛好也有這念頭
I know a couple of guys that'll feel the exact same way.

952
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,830
正合我意
I'm counting on it.

953
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
塔霍湖

954
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000

Emergency exit now.

960
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,660
漢尼拔

00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,000
緊急出口

962
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,880
拜庫斯  別跑
Baracus, don't do it!

963
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,760
他去哪兒  他要干嘛
Where he going? What's he doing, man?

964
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,680
拜庫斯  真他媽見鬼
Baracus! God damn it!

965
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,180
我是索薩
Sosa.

966
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,600
中尉  派克也越獄了
Lieutenant, Peck's already gone.

967
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,730
什么
What?

968
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,060
還剩拜庫斯和默多克了  著手處理這件事  中尉
Baracus and Murdock are left. Handle it, Lieutenant.

969
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,320
好的
Right. Okay.

970
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,900
我不想再出這種丟臉的事了
I don't want to be embarrassed like this again. Do you?

971
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,570
好  別  別   我們馬上就開始部署人員進行抓捕
Okay. No, no, no, no. We're gonna catch and deploy from here.

972
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,650
派克越獄了
Peck escaped.

973
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,200
-靠  你覺得與史密斯有關嗎  -顯然啊
-Oh, hell. You think Smith is involved?  -Definitely.

974
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,030
立刻準備他們的照片  任何可以立馬識別出他們的
Get graphics on him and Smith. Anything that'll ID them instantly.

975
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,120
默多克被關在曼海姆精神病醫院
I know they got Murdock in a psych ward in Mannheim.

976
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,710
怪頭那家伙又他媽的在哪兒
Right. Okay. Where the hell is B.A. Baracus?

977
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,470
你怎么知道那個門
How did you know that once that door was extracted

978
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,600
-掉下來后能支撐他的體重  -我想嘛  
- that it would take his weight?  - l just did. He's...

979
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,220
-他大概有102 104公斤吧  -104公斤
- You know, he's what, 225, 230 pounds?  - 230. Yeah.

980
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,930
你記得我們七年前在委內瑞拉的那次任務嗎
Remember the gag we did in Venezuela seven years ago?

981
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,230
委內瑞拉  記得
Venezuela. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

982
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,020
但那人個子很小
But that was a midget.

983
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,520
我考慮到了
Yeah, I wouldn't go for that.

984
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,690
-嘿  大塊頭  他來了  -回來了
- Hey, big guy. There he is.  - Yeah! He's back.

再見到你們真高興
It's good to see you guys.

990
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,830

What, you don't like my new do, man?

992
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,220
啥  不是給你準備推子推頭了嗎  我以為 
Do I like it? Well, we got you the clippers. I thought...

993
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,090
我這不是用了嘛
Yeah, I used them.

994
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,430

996
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,020
伙計們
Guys...

997
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,440
我不能再殺人了
I can't kill anybody.

998
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,700
-什么意思  -我發過誓
- What do you mean?  - I've taken a vow.

999
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,030
-什么誓  -遠離暴力
- Vow?  - Of non-violence.

1000
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,410
我仍會跟你們合作
I'll still do anything for you guys, you know that.

1001
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,750
但我不會殺人  
But I just can't kill, man.

1002
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,290
雖然舊習難改
Old habits may die hard,

1003
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,500
但終將改過
but they still gotta die.

1004
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,680
小時候大家都說  
When l was a kid, all you heard in the hood was,

1005
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,600
博斯克是個大壞蛋  嗜殺如狂
"Bosco's a badass, out collecting scalps."

1006
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,310
所以我留莫霍克頭
That's where the Mohawk came from.

1007
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,310
于是我一直在戰斗  
Was always at war.

1008
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,480
這就是戰士的宿命
And that's what warriors are for.

1009
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,480
漢尼拔  伙計  我不想要這種生活
Hannibal, man. I don't miss that life.

1010
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:26,030
我會幫忙把默多克弄出來  扭轉我們的的不公待遇
I'll help you get Murdock, and right that wrong,

1011
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,570
-但不能殺人  -帕克也不殺嗎
- but I can't kill.  - Even Pike?

1012
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,120
即使殺掉他能洗清你的罪名
Even if killing him would clear your name?

1013
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,660
我現在只想對得起自己的良心
My conscience is the only thing l need clear.

1014
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,210
那么  那個小瘋子大蠢蛋在哪兒
Now, where's that crazy-ass fool?

1017
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,340
不能把感情全堆在心里
You can't warehouse these things, you know?

1018
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,850
你只有發泄出來才會有所好轉
You have to express to progress.

1019
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,270
要為你的情感大廈添磚加瓦
We gotta empower your emotional tower

1020
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,310
你要珍惜自己也要學會接受別人的愛
and send out a wavelength of self-love and acceptance.

1021
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,650
謝謝
Thank you.

He seems completely impervious to it. It's impossible to develop a base reading.

1026
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,380

Have you increased the voltage?

1027

1031
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:46,400
我覺得好像感覺到了什么
Yeah, I think I might have felt something there.

1032
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,330
我不會入睡的

01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,120
安娜貝拉   超越了自我  看看
Annabelle. You have outdone yourself. Look at this.

1044
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,370
-太真實啦  -真美

01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,460
給我撥專線電話  不管是誰  
Get me a direct line to whoever is running those drones.

1174
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,880
快讓那些無機停下來  我該遭批斗了
We gotta get these drones to stand down or I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

1175
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,680
我們要活捉那些人
I need to get those men alive!

1176
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,520
大家還好嗎
Everybody okay?

1177
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,230
他們會覺得我們已經掛了嗎
What are the chances they think we're dead?

1178
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,980
可能性不大
Not great.

1179
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:09,820
-我們不在飛機上了吧  -我們真不在那架飛機上了
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.  - We ain't on that plane.

1180
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,990
漢尼拔
Hannibal!

1181
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,700
只要在兩萬英尺以下  就死不了吧
If we're under 20,000 feet, we can still breathe, right?

1182
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,320
什么兩萬英尺
What are you talking about, 20,000 feet?

1183
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,290
-咱們啟動舊火力系統吧  -見鬼
- Let's fire up the old weapons system.  - What the hell, man?

1184
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,330
博斯克  這兒悶死了  我要開個窗
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy. I'm gonna pop a window!

1185
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,670
奶奶滴  看誰有能耐  比比吧
What you got, bitches? What you got?

1186
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,140
小白  也讓我來耍耍  快點嘛
Let me have a turn, Face! Come on!

1187
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,100
-我們怎么會呆在一個墜落的坦克里  -因為飛機爆炸了
- Why are we in a falling tank?  - Because the plane exploded!

1188
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,930
什么  啥時候  
What... What? When?

1189
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,310
就剛才
Recently!

1190
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,940
-被收割者擊落了  -什么收割者
- The Reapers shot it down!  - What Reapers?

1191
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,610
就是那些現在還窮追不舍的家伙
The same ones that are still trying to kill us!

1192
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,110
-漢尼拔  都怪你  -嚴格來講  我們沒在飛了嘛  
- l blame you, Hannibal!  - Technically, we're not flying.

1193
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,570
廢話  我們是在墜落  混蛋
I know! Because we're falling, fool!

1194
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,540
額滴神啊
Oh, Jesus!

1195
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,750
2號無人機墜落  我們損失了一架無人機
UAV-2 has splashed down. We just lost one of the drones.

1196
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,260
漢尼拔  這下我們慘了
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

1197
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,970
伙計們繃緊了
Brace yourselves!

1198
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,300
爽翻天了
Awesome!

1199
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,720
小白  你操縱主炮  
Face, get on to the main gun!

1200
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,060
離這八百米的地方有個湖
There's a lake a half-mile away from this position.

1201
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,060
-我操他媽的朝誰開火啊  -相信我
- What the hell am l trying to hit?  - Trust me!

01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,320
開火
Fire!

1205
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,080
他們是想再射落一架無人機嗎
Are they trying to shoot down that other drone?

1206
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,830
不  他們是在駕駛坦克
No. They're trying to fly that tank.

1207
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,370
-坦克飛起來咯  -坦克飛不起來  傻逼
- He's flying the tank!  - You can't fly a tank, fool!

1208

再轉到34度
Rotate 34 degrees now!

1211
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,590
-漢尼拔  -等下
- Hannibal...  - Wait...

1212
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,100
開火

1213
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,520
-控制中心  我們失去了無人機  -確定擊中了嗎 
- Control, we have lost...  - Is that a confirmed hit?

1214
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,690
右轉正前方  待命
Bring turret full-front and wait!

1215
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:12,980
默多克  關閉艙門 
Murdock! Close the hatch!

1216
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,650
收到  這樣能行不 
Hatch, okay! Did that work? Did that work?

1217
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,240
-頭兒  -加把勁呀

-加把勁  -關好艙口沒
- Come on.  - Hatch control?

1219
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,780
我還不想這么早死 
I'm too young to die!

1220
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,160
頭兒  現在都不用瞄準了
Boss! I'm aiming at nothing!

1221
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,160
加把勁
Come on.

1222

-先生們  我很榮幸  -加把勁  寶貝兒 
- It's been an honor, gentlemen.  - Come on, baby.

- Fire everything!  - Come on, baby!

1225
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
我的駕駛技術如何

1226
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,140
-上帝保佑呀  上帝顯靈吧  -加把勁
- Get right with God, y'all! This is it!   - Come on!

1227
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,610
這對魚類不公平
It's not fair to the fish!

1228
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,110
你作弊
You're cheating!

1229
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,620
真嘮叨
You with your nagging...

1230
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,120
把魚都嚇跑了
...you're chasing them away!

1231
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,120
中情局國外辦事處

1232

德國  法蘭克福

1233
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,020
好了  辛勤的小蜜蜂
All right. Busy bees, busy bees.

1234
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:31,690
把外套脫了吧  太他媽熱了
Guys, you can take your coats off. Hot as hell in here.

1235
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,360
熱得跟蒸桑拿一樣
I'm sweating like a whore in church.

1236
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,570
-長官  -什么事
- Sir.  - Yeah?

1237
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:37,860
史密斯一伙人在德國曼海姆劫了一架C1 30運輸機
Smith and his team were engaged in a C-1 30 over Mannheim, Germany,

1238
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,740
還擊落了兩架無人機
by two Reaper drones.

1239
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,030
不知道是不是數據加密出了故障
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch,

1240
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,160
但報告里說是被一輛坦克擊落
but it says that they were shot down in a tank.

1241
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:50,210
北美空防司令部想掩蓋為失蹤  但麻煩的是我們
NORAD's calling it an X-out, but there is a conflicting report.

1242
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,500
我就知道
I'm sure there is.

1243
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:55,090
一名德國老婦說她看到一輛坦克
I've got a German Hausfrau who says she saw a tank

drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee with a guy resembling Murdock...

1245
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,340
打擾一下  柏林怎么走
Excuse me, which way to Berlin?

1246
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:04,390
-問她柏林去怎么走  -這不可能
- ...asking for directions to Berlin.  - That's impossible.

1247
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:08,720
史密斯一周內都死了兩次了
Well, this will be the second time Smith has died this week.

1248
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,430
對他們來說還有什么不可能的呢
ls that possible?

1249
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,500
美國駐歐洲指揮部

1250
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,500

1251
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,730

- What have you got for me?  - Look at this.

1252
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,990
我們對史密斯的訪客圖像進行了還原
We just got the unscrambled composite of Smith's visitor in prison,

1253
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,450
但沒有查到該人身份
but with no lD on the subject yet.

1254
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,830
你好  帥哥
Hello, handsome.

1255
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,660
等下  我以前見過他
Wait, I've seen this person before.

1256

1257
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,090
巴格達
Baghdad.

1258
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,380
給我洗張清晰的出來  我們開始行動
Get me a clean patch to Langley. We're going fishing.

1259
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,010
我都沒聽說過
I barely even heard about it.

1260
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,680
我零碎地聽說了些  但這些怎么跟我們扯上了關系
I mean, I heard bits and pieces of it, but how much of that was us?

1261
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,100
-我已經  -我在說話呢
- So, l have a...  - l was talking.

1262
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,600
-不會和我們牽扯上的  -別說了好嗎  
- It's never us.  - Can you stop?

1263
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,980
國防部的索薩中尉打來電話

01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,730
她找林奇特工
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

1265
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,110
林奇特工沒空  一直沒空
He's not available, ever.

1266
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,190
巴格達的林奇特工
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

1267
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,700
在莫里森將軍的帳篷那次
General Morrison's tent?

1268
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,450
出去
Out.

1269
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,490
為什么雇她
Why do we have her?

1270
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,290
因為她超有個性
She's got a fantastic personality. That's why.

1271
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,210
請問哪位
With whom am l speaking?

1272
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:19,130
我是索薩上  中尉  你是林奇特工嗎
This is Capt... uh Lieutenant Sosa. ls this Agent Lynch?

1273
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,460
不好意思  我不知道你的名字  
I'm sorry, I don't have a first name.

1274
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,050
我也不知道  有何貴干  中尉
Neither do I. So, what can l do you for, Lieutenant?

1275
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,180
我看見一張你在卡森要塞
I'm looking at an image of you

1276
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,260
訓練營的照片
from the disciplinary barracks at Fort Carson.

1277
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,270
真性感
She's hot.

1278
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,230
你在監獄里探訪過前上校漢尼拔·史密斯嗎
Did you visit former Colonel Hannibal Smith in prison?

1279
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,730
我不知道你在說什么  前上尉
I don't know what you're talking about, former Captain.

1280
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,570
林奇特工  如果是你協助史密斯逃走
Agent Lynch, if you facilitated Smith's escape

1281
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,780
并且正在暗中協助和支持他的話
and are currently aiding and abetting him...

1282
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,870
那可真是 
Ooh. Buddy.

1283
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,830
要是換作是你  這么做的話
lf you can make something like that stick,

1284
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,410
可就一步登天了啊
your next promotion should be in the five-star range.

1285
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,540
如果你還要協助他們搶回模板
And if you're helping to retrieve those engraving plates,

1286
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,380
那我就不得不出手阻止你了
I'm going to have to go out of my way to disappoint you.

1287
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:17,020
查出她的電話  電腦和其它輔助設備
I want her phones, her computers, any support packages she operates.

1288
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,310
我要掌握一切  我要攔截她的所有情報
I wanna know everything. I want active intercept taps on everything she's got.

1289
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,230
從現在開始監視她的一舉一動
l want every move monitored from this moment forward.

1290
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,190
她可是國防部的人
You realize she's DoD.

1291
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,950
她是天王老子我也不怕  照做
I don't care if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1292
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,030
長官  看看這個
Boss, check this out.

1293
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,250
這張照片上  帕克是在法蘭克福的孔希斯銀行
We've tracked this photograph of Pike to the K?nigsbank in Frankfurt.

1294
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,040
監控錄像記錄了上個月
Our surveillance has him and an unknown Arab

1295
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,500
他一直和一個阿拉伯人一起
making regular trips from the train station to the bank

1296
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,540
從火車站到銀行去
all over the last month.

1297
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,710
-帕克大意了  -要是我們查到了
- Pike's getting sloppy.  - Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1298
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,380
史密斯那伙人會不會也盯上了他們
what are the odds that Smith and his team are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1299
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,800
不  不  這是國防部的高度機密信息
No, no, no, this is a direct pull-down from the Pentagon's database.

1300
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:53,560
史密斯他們絕不可能得到這情報
There's absolutely no way Smith and his team could have this stuff.

1301
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,390
不要低估他們  他們的情報遠比我們得要多
I think we should assume they have more information than us at all times.

1302
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,190
帕克自上個月以來  就一直把模板
Pike has been moving the stolen engraving plates

1303
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,150
往法蘭克福的孔希斯銀行大樓運送
to the Konigsbank Tower in Frankfurt over the past month.

1304
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,820
明天是最后一批箱子
Tomorrow, the last of the cases containing these plates

1305
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,240
之后將轉交給阿拉伯人
will be transferred to the Arab.

1306
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,570
這是過去六個月來
This will mark the only time in the last six months

1307
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,450
這些模板第一次集中出現
that all of the plates have been in one location.

1308
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,790
要奪回它們  這是最好也是唯一的一次機會
It's our best and only shot at getting them back.

1309
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,540
他們離開孔希斯銀行大樓  乘坐七點一刻到蘇黎世的火車
They leave the Konigsbank Tower for the 7:15 train to Zurich.

1310
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:24,670
先生們  我們可不能讓他們如愿了
Gentlemen, we're gonna make sure they miss that train.

1311
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,920
-小白  -在
- Face?  - Yeah.

1312
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,130
去找你的舊愛吧
Time to bring in your former flame.

1313
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,590
要是她真如我所料那般犀利
If she's as good as l think,

1314
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,300
現在就該去法蘭克福了  為了攔截那些模板
then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt to intercept those plates.

1315
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,310
-你為何要關照她  -她是個理想主義者 
- Why would you tip her off?  - She's a crusader,

1316
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,350
也許我們之后會用得到她
and we're gonna need her teed up at some point.

1317
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,900
提高警惕  伙計們
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

1318
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,690
查瑞莎·索薩
Charissa Sosa...

1319
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,650
查瑞莎·索薩
Charissa Sosa...

1320
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,150
問題在于  
Now the wrinkle.

1321
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,700
要是索薩盯上了我們  也就可以推測  林奇也盯上了她
If Sosa's onto us, we can assume that Lynch is onto her.

1322
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,540
要是林奇覺得她是個麻煩人物
And if he thinks she stands beteen him and those plates,

1323
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,540
他就會毫不猶豫地干掉她 
he won't hesitate to kill her.

1324
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,670
小白  去火車站
Face, get to the train station.

1325
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,170
我是索薩
This is Sosa.

1326
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,880
要是林奇威脅到她  你要負責搞定
If there's a threat from Lynch, deal with it.

1327
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,680
喂
Hello?

1328
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,060
可以開槍  重復一遍  可以開槍
Shoot is green. Say again, shoot is green.

1329
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,470
喂
Hello?

1330
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,730
不對勁
Something's wrong.

1331
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,820
我們成了靶子  快撤  這情況不妙
We're marked, guys. Pull back. I don't like this at all.

1332
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,620
記住  別被人看到
See. Don't be seen.

1333
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,330
-你好  美人兒  -你真夠膽
- Hello, beautiful.  - You have got some balls.

1334
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,960
-居然丟給我個手機  -沒辦法
- You put a drop phone on me?  - l had to, babe.

1335
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,830
只有這樣我才能跟你說話  林奇掌握著你所有的通訊線路
It's the only way I could talk to you. Lynch has all your comm lines.

1336
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,340
-你都快撤掉你的人  -我會找到你的  小白
- I want you to pull your team now.  - I'm gonna find you, Face.

1337
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,220
不要跟她或其他任何人直接接觸
But do not engage her or anyone else directly.

1338
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,670
我先找到你再說吧
Not if l find you first.

1339
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,350
別  好了  好了
Come on, all right... Okay. Okay.

1340
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,600
往 這 兒 看

1341
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,690
天啊
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1342
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:10,980
-你到底想怎么樣  -救你命
- What the hell are you doing?  - Trying to save you!

1343
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,490
查瑞莎
Charissa.

1344
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:21,040
你知道我們是無辜的  你心里清楚  
Come on, you know we're innocent. You know this.

1345
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,160
你在撒謊  就像你在巴格達那樣
You're lying. Like you lied in Baghdad.

1346
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,170
我不知道  我對模板的事一無所知
I did not know. l knew nothing about the plates.

1347
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,420
當時的確不知道
At that... At that time.

1348
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,960
你謊話連篇
You are completely full of shit!

1349
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,470
你就別一套一套的了
Will you stop selling yourself on that

1350
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,180
當時明明是你騙了我
and avoiding the fact that you lied to me!

1351
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,340
-明明是你騙我  -什么時候  
- You're the one that misled me.  - When?

1352
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,510
-得了  你想翻舊賬嗎  -不錯
- Come on. You wanna go there?  - Yeah, let's go there.

1353
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,390
你知道我是玩玩的  你也就想和我玩玩
You heard l was a player and you wanted to play.

1354
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:42,640
但我開始變得認真了  你就慌了
And then l got serious and you freaked!

1355
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,890
-我慌了嗎  我才沒有慌  -你慌了
- Oh, l freaked? l did not freak!  - Yes, you did.

1356
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:48,520
你驚慌失措  然后落跑
You panicked and you ran.

1357
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:56,360
想想吧  查瑞莎
Charissa, come on.

1358
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:59,660
我可是聯邦逃犯  你也知道我被通緝
I'm a federal fugitive. You know exactly how wanted I am.

1359
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:03,830
你覺得我干嘛來法蘭克福  來找老情人嗎  才不是
You think I came to Frankfurt to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1360
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,370
我之所以來這兒  因為不是我們干的  我們是被人陷害
I'm here because we didn't do this. I'm here because we were set up.

1361
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:11,090
我相信最終會真相大白  所以我來這里冒險
I'm here because, in the end, the truth is worth the risk.

1362
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:17,300
就算你不信任我  我也相信你
And I believe in you, even if you don't believe in me.

1363
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,470
天  我都忘了你原來這么美
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

1364
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,860
收好這部手機
Hold on to that phone.

1365
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,370
我的老天
OH MY GOD!

1366
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,580
他有槍
HE'S GOT A GUN!

1367
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,080
就在那兒  他有槍
RlGHT THERE! HE'S GOT A GUN!

1368
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,880
槍
A GUN!

1369
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,340
真廢柴
Sucker.

1370
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,130
-見鬼  -派克在哪兒
- Oh, shit.  - Where's Peck?

1371
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,220
別光是問  快去找他
Excellent question. Find him!

1372
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,550
請保持鎮靜  從最近的出口離開
Please stay calm and go to the nearest exit.

1373
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:11,090
孔希斯銀行大樓

1374
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,090
德國  法蘭克福

1375
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,090
三號通道見
Meet you up on corridor three.

1376
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,420
三號報告  現在一切正常
Three to base. We're all clear at this time.

1377
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:44,300
包裹安全后給我確認一下
Give me confirmation as soon as the package is secure.

1378
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,100
我們要看到視頻監視畫面
We need a video feed.

1379
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,290
好了  開始吧
Okay, let's dance.

1380
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,880
各就各位  準備行動
Coming down. Positions, prepare to move.

1381
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,460
像平時一樣  跟緊我  先生
As always, stay close to me, sir.

1382
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,150
正在關閉第十層
Closing off the 10th floor.

1383
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,770
十層的人   我們需要支援
Tenth floor, we need backup.

1384
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,650
回來
Get back! Get back!

1385
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,240
我什么都看不見
l can't see anything.

1386
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,650
頭兒  情況如何
How we doing there, big man?

1387
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,410
默多克  接好阿拉伯人 
Murdock, here comes the Arab.

1388
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,160
這是一個向左邊中場的
And here's a long drive

1389
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,160
長傳遠射
hit deep into left center field.

1390
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:52,210
默多克殺了回來  他是背水一戰  竟然接住了
Murdock's back, he's at the wall, and he makes the catch!

1391
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,500
我喘不過氣來了
I can't breathe.

1392
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,670
這是個圈套
It's a trap!

1393
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,800
皮特  我們需要支援
Pete, we need backup!

1394
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,020
怪頭  箱子丟了  
B.A., I lost the case.

1395
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,480
我受到攻擊  準備撤離
I'm taking fire. I'm out of here.

1396
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:31,160
怪頭  快去拿回模板
B.A., get to those plates.

1397
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,550
一群聯邦政府人員已經對
Deutsche Federal is responding to explosions and shots fired

1398
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,760
-孔希斯大樓的爆炸和槍擊做出了反應  -趕快離開這里
- at the Konigsbank building.  - Get us out of this mess and get us

1399
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,930
-趕去大樓那邊  -遵命  
- to that building as soon as possible.  - Yes, ma'am.

1400
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,210
是你逼我的  拜庫斯
You made me work for this one, Baracus.

1401
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:02,040
沒想到我會這么狼狽
I didn't think l was this out of shape.

1402
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,300
真不走運  
I am, unfortunately.

1403
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,380
其他人呢
Where's the rest of the team, huh?

1404
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,640
史密斯  派克  還有那個傻逼飛行員  他叫什么來著
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot, the asshole. What's his name?

1405
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,310
我要把你打得屁股尿流  拜庫斯  看看你有什么能耐
I'm gonna take this one out of your ass, Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1406
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,690
來啊  發什么愣  沒力氣了嗎  
Come on. What are you doing? What, are you tired?

1407
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,940
我不想傷害你  老兄
I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1408
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,030
不  你傷不了我  等著挨揍吧
No, you're not gonna hurt me, I'm gonna hurt you.

1409
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,700
-我不想殺了你  伙計  -你不想嗎  
- l don't wanna kill you, man.  - You don't wanna kill me?

1410
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,710
你根本殺不了我  我要殺了你  拜庫斯
You're not gonna kill me. I'm gonna kill you, Baracus.

1411
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:40,920
我沒在開玩笑  帕克
I'm not playing with you, Pike.

1412
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,040
來吧  我有兩把槍  記得吧  我是左撇子  
Here we go, because I got two guns. I'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1413
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:46,500
剛剛打斗的時候  槍已經上膛了吧
So, as soon as that hammer goes back, it's on.

1414
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,300
我發誓  我做得出來
I swear to God, I'll do it.

1415
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,380
你不是懦夫吧
You're not a coward, are you?

1416
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,090
是不
Are you?

1417
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:58,270
真難看
Whoopsy.

1418
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,430
去你媽的
Damn!

1419
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,100
-要搭車嗎  大塊頭  -你救了我一命  老兄
- Need a ride, big fella?  - You're a life-saver, man.

1420
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:02,270
我下不了手
I couldn't shoot him.

1421
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,200
讓開  趴下
Get out of the way! Get down! Get down!

1422
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,150
這么多條子
Yeah, this is about the right amount of cops.

1423
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:51,360
你真可愛  你應該慶幸周圍都是人  
That's cute. You're lucky there are people around.

1424
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,240
不  親愛的  你才應該慶幸
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1425
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,910
你不熱下再吃嗎
You eat that cold?

1426
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:04,670
我不講究
Any way I can get it.

1427
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,420
屋頂有處地方漏了
There's a leak in the roof.

1428
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,500
好多處都漏了
There's a lot of them.

1429
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,090
-他們回來了  -是的
- Is that them?  - I got it.

1430
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,850
好吧  我沒偷看過阿拉伯人
All right. Not a peep out of the Arab.

1431
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,760
索薩當時在火車站
Sosa was at the train station.

1432
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,100
-你見她了嗎  -是的
- You saw her?  - Yeah.

1433
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:24,140
你和她談過了嗎
Did you talk to her?

1434
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:26,940
我別無選擇  好嗎  相信我
I had no choice, okay? Just trust me on that.

1435
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,860
信你個頭  一涉及到女人你就頭腦發熱
I trust you to make historically bad decisions

1436
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,360
盡出昏招  
as far as women are concerned.

1437
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,780
你到底是怎么想的
What part of you is thinking at the moment?

1438
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,110
林奇的人要殺她  我必須阻止
Lynch's men moved in on her and l had to react.

1439
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,570
這不是你派我去的初衷嗎
That's why you wanted me there in the first place...

1440
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,740
是去阻止而不是去泡她
To stop them! Not to engage her!

1441
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:41,240
只有先泡上了她  我才能去阻止他們
I couldn't do one without the other.

1442
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,870
得了  我很懷疑 
Please. Somehow I doubt that.

1443
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,790
你干嘛這么生氣  我們找回了模板  
Hey. What are you so pissed about? We got the plates.

1444
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,210
她也得到了情報
You wanted her teed up. She's teed up.

1445
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,630
她知道我們沒偷
She knows we didn't steal them.

1446
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,970
她肯定急于查出真正的幕后黑手
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1447
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,890
什么
What?

1448
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:07,230
你一定知道
You had to know.

1449
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:15,240
你一定知道  如果你留我一條命  這一刻遲早會到來
You had to know if you left me alive, that this was coming.

1450
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,120
你怎么會不知道呢
How could you not?

1451
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:35,420
你教會了我一切
You taught me almost everything I know.

1452
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:40,600
漢尼拔  你認識這個人嗎
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1453
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,440
我們都認識
We all do.

1454
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,860
莫里森
Morrison?

1455
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,820
不是吧
Hell, no.

1456
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,490
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1457
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,540
不知道這算不算祝福  行動順利  朋友
Not so sure that it is a blessing, but good hunting, my friend.

1458
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:12,380
謝謝
Thank you.

1459
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,050
你個賤人
You son of a bitch.

1460
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:23,430
莫里森  真天殺的
Morrison? Holy shit.

1461
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,940
你不是將軍
You're not a general.

1462
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,400
你把他怎么了
How could you do this to him?

1463
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,730
你對得起我們嗎
How could you do this to us?

1464
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,820
你不配當將軍
You know nothing about leading men.

1465
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:44,700
我就知道  林奇如果協助我逃跑  那你肯定也有參與其中
I knew if Lynch helped me escape, you had to be part of it.

1466
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,170
你和帕克利用模板和林奇達成協議
You and Pike were making a play on those plates with Lynch,

1467
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,500
但你背叛了他  
and you turned on him.

1468
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,920
就像你背叛我們一樣
The way you turned on us.

1469
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,340
林奇本來就沒把我們算在內
Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1470
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,760
他只是在利用我們
He was gonna use us.

1471
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,260
為保險起見他才把你拉進來
He brought you on as insurance.

1472
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:08,020
你就沒想過  這是背叛了你的摯友嗎
He never thought you'd betray your oldest living friend.

1473
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,770
我只是先下手為強  漢尼拔  我是個戰士
I just hit first, Hannibal. I'm a fighting man.

1474
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,480
你是個騙子  叛徒
You're a liar and a traitor!

1475
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,860
別廢話了  殺了我
Then don't draw this out. Kill me.

1476
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,480
好主意呀
That's a fantastic idea!

1477
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,000
頭兒  讓我來
Bos, let me do this.

1478
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,740
小白   我可不殺人
Face, I ain't killing nobody.

1479
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:27,950
你不殺  我殺
You're not, Bosco. I am.

1480
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,210
不管他說啥  別殺他  好嗎
No matter what he says, do not kill him, okay?

1481
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,040
不想看就別過頭去
You guys don't wanna watch? Just turn your heads.

1482
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,880
-我不贊成殺他  -我也很想殺了他
- I'm not gonna be party to it neither.  - I wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

1483
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,250
但他是我們的救命稻草
but he's our ticket out.

1484
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,460
他終于不說瘋話了  聽他一回
He knows what he's talking about for once. Listen to him.

1485
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:41,420
-小白  他是我們唯一的證人  -默多克
- Face, he is our only evidence.  - Murdock, Murdock...

1486
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,840
-明白不  -我們現在都是他害的
- Do you understand?   - He put us here.

1487
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,850
等他給我們做完證再崩了他
You can blow his head off after he testifies, okay?

1488
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:46,890
他把一切都毀了
He's ruined it!

1489
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,510
-好好想想你在做什么  小白  -好了
- Think what you're doing, Face.  -  All right.

1490
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,310
-如果你不能  -夠了 兄弟們
- If you can't handle it...  - Boys, enough.

1491
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,690
夠了  小白
Enough! That's enough, Face.

1492
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,070
夠了  退下
Enough! Step down!

1493
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:58,820
大家都出去
Everybody outside

1494
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,530
我來
I got him.

1495
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,320
-還是讓我干掉他吧  -小白  出去
- I don't want you to have to do it.  - Face, outside.

1496
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,490
退下  
Stand down, soldier.

1497
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,160
小白  馬上
Face. Now!

1498
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,620
-真他媽愚蠢  -你沒事吧  伙計
- Fucking stupid.  - You okay, man?

1499
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,580
你知道莫里森偽裝成阿拉伯人
You knew Morrison was masquerading as the Arab.

1500
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,840
-為什么不告訴我  -我也不能百分之百肯定
- Why not share that?  - I wasn't 100% sure.

1501
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,420
只有99%的把握嗎
How about 99%?

1502
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,260
你不覺得這很重要嗎
Would you think it was worth mentioning then?

1503
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,300
林奇  你到底在想什么
Lynch, what did you think?

1504
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,590
你覺得我會當場殺了他嗎
You think I'd just kill him on the spot?

1505
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,100
我知道你不會  我相信你
I was certain of it. I still am.

1506
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,100
你拿到模板了嗎
Do you have the plates?

1507
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,850
當然  不然我會打給你嗎
I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

1508
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,310
史密斯  歸還模板  殺了莫里斯  你們就能洗清罪名
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison, and reclaim your lives.

1509
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,570
我要白宮  國務院
I want signed and authorized amnesty agreements

1510
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,070
和三軍參謀長聯席會議
for myself and for each of my men.

1511
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,110
所簽署并授權的赦免令
From the White House, the State Department

1512
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,240
給我和我的兄弟們
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1513
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:49,830
你聽到了嗎
You hear me?

1514
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:53,750
再給我點時間
I'm gonna need a little more time.

1515
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,330
要多久
How much?

1516
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,330
目標時間倒計時

1517
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,880
五分鐘
Give me five minutes.

1518
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,880
我等著
I'm waiting.

1519
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,690
還不明白嗎  漢尼拔
Don't you get it, Hannibal?

1520
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,400
我們為他們打仗  流血  犧牲
We fight for them, we bleed for them, we die for them...

1521
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,190
他們才不管我們死活
They don't give a rat's ass.

1522
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,320
死亡和毀滅
Death and destruction,

1523
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,700
對他們來說無足輕重
they're selling it like it was on the goddamn commodities exchange.

1524
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,660
你別指責他們   和他們無關
Don't push this off on them. This is not about them.

1525
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,500
你所謂的反戰已經造成了數十億美元的損失
Your war protest was stealing billions of dollars!

1526
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:37,960
你到底是誰
Who are you?

1527
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:40,590
我是將軍  你是名上校
I am a general. You are a colonel.

1528
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:44,340
我指揮  你行動
I say, "Jump," and you say, "How high?" End of story.

1529
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,420
你該上路了
It is now.

1530
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,600
我親眼看到你在阿靈頓的墓碑
l saw your tomb at Arlington.

1531
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,600
為國捐軀的軍人均葬于此

1532
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:55,770
你是為國捐軀的英雄
You died a national hero.

1533
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,990
死了太便宜你
Death's too easy.

1534
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:13,200
我們再也不想聽什么謊言了
And the last thing we need now is another lie.

1535
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,330
別這樣  漢尼拔  你欠我那么多
Don't do this. Hannibal, please. You owe me that much.

1536
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,000
是你欠我
You owe me!

1537
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,580
你要去告訴世人  我們是無罪的  
You're gonna tell them we're innocent.

1538
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,130
你欠我的
You owe me.

1539
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,050
漢尼拔  你們所為之而戰的東西
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1540
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,220
根本毫無意義
What are you fighting for now, you and those boys?

1541
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:34,100
你們的軍銜和名譽  
Your ranks? Your reputations?

1542
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:35,260
都是狗屁
They're shit!

1543
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,640
你們就是罪人  
You're convicts!

1544
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:41,100
不管有沒有模板   你們都是聯邦逃犯
Plates, no plates, you are federal fugitives,

1545
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:44,980
等他們利用完了你  漢尼拔  照樣把你丟棄
and when they're done with you, Hannibal, they just fucking burn you.

1546
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:50,030
祖魯一號  我是闊劍  準備行動
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword, you're clear to engage.

1547
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:52,450
闊劍  這名字你起的嗎
"Broadsword." Did you come up with that?

1548
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:54,910
好酷的名字   闊劍
That's awesome. "Broadsword."

1549
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,660
闊劍
"Broadsword."

1550
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,750
頭兒  你會那樣做嗎
Boss, could you do that?

1551
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,000
對我們  
To us?

1552
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,170
就像莫里森那樣對我們
What Morrison did?

1553
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,010
不  永遠不會
No. Not in a million years.

1554
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,550
是啊  但你卻失算了
Yeah, but you didn't see it coming, though.

1555
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,470
你什么時候就認出他來了
How long did you know it was him?

1556
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,850
你們瘋了嗎
Are you guys crazy?

1557
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,600
你本來就是瘋子  但  小白  你在譴責漢尼拔嗎
I know you are, but, Face, are you accusing him?

1558
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:26,020
我寧愿被特警隊亂槍打死也不會背叛你們
I'd rather face a firing squad than betray you boys.

1559
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:27,900
自己人不要吵起來
Don't let this tear us apart.

1560
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:29,570
至少現在不能吵
Not now.

1561
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,780
我們現在要比任何時候都團結才行
Not when we need each other like no other time before.

1562
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,700
快跑
Move!

1563
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,550
酷斃了
Wow. That's awesome.

1564
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:57,350
就像使命召喚里的場景  你覺得呢
That looks exactly like Call of Duty, doesn't it?

1565
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,600
好了  要求是  禁止發布新聞
All right. Here's the deal. No press release.

1566
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,980
不要當地法律機關和新聞媒體參與
Keep local law enforcement and media off-site.

1567
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,560
設立4.8公里的隔離和禁飛區 
Get a three-mile cordon, ditto the no-fly zone.

1568
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:09,110
派一支清理小隊過去把該死的模板找回來
Get an agency scrub team out there and get me the goddamn plates back.

1569
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:15,160
德國警方已經把你手下所有人都監禁在了孔希斯銀行大樓
The German police have your entire team in custody in the Konigsbank Tower.

1570
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:20,870
那不是我的人  是史密斯他們的  我單干
I don't do teams, babe. That's Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act.

1571
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,550
美 國 大 使 館

1572
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,050
我喜歡輕裝出行
I like to travel light.

1573
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:36,590
像忠誠這種東西  我可不帶
Stuff like loyalty doesn't fit in the overhead bins.

1574
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,890
我以為你和史密斯是同伙
I thought you and Smith were working together.

1575
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:43,100
你錯了
You thought wrong.

1576
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:46,560
我們是有武器  但你也管不著
Yes, we have weapons. No, you may not wand us.

1577
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,730
你想要做交易嗎  那就提條件吧
If you want to deal, we can deal.

1578
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:55,780
讓我費盡心思使你一敗涂地  
How about l dedicate my immediate future

1579
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,410
如何
to destroying yours?

1580
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:02,660
你怎么不聰明一些
How about you get smart and start dealing

1581
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,210
在別人出手之前  先下手為強呢
before somebody else does?

1582
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,630
前任上尉
Former Captain.

1583
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,710
除非你有像這樣的文件
Unless you've got a piece of paper that looks exactly like this one,

1584
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,880
不然這個不合作的麻煩家伙歸我管
then this troubled young loner belongs to me.

1585
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,260
我們走
Let's go.

1586
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,810
他們到底怎么搞來的引渡令
How the hell did they get an extradition order?

1587
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:23,680
抱歉  帕克  至少我們按規矩辦事
Sorry, Pike. At least with me, there are rules.

1588
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:27,000
中情局也有規矩  比你們更高級而已
CIA's got rules. Our rules are just cooler than yours.

1589
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:29,150
-走  -林奇
- Go.  - You know, Lynch,

1590
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:32,820
要是我把你關在這間屋子里  那可是做了一件大好事
if l could seal this room with you inside, l'd be doing the world a big favor.

1591
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,070
那可不好
That's not nice.

1592
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,200
是林奇干的  肯定是他
Lynch? Had to be.

1593
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,740
離火近一些  弟兄們
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1594
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:44,540
要是那架武裝機還在附近  那也測不出我們的體熱
lf that gunship is still around, it won't read our body heat.

1595
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:48,830
林奇個傻逼  這么心急要干掉我們  根本沒想要確定模板的位置
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill us, didn't even bother locating the plates.

1596
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,920
我們現在還能不用武力嗎  怪頭
Where do we stand on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1597
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,010
你生氣了嗎  你是該生氣
You pissed? You should be.

1598
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:57,510
現在模板有屁用  只有莫里森能幫我們洗脫罪名
Who gives a shit about the plates? Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1599
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:00,180
沒有了莫里森  一切都無濟于事
And without Morrison, we got nothing.

1600
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,020
-我們怎么辦  頭兒   -我不知道  默多克
- What do we do, boss?  - I don't know, Murdock.

1601
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,350
-我不知道  -我知道
- I don't know.  - I do.

1602
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:11,900
林奇個混球  我想我知道怎么對付他了
This guy Lynch, I think I got him figured out.

1603
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,530
-你有計劃了嗎  小子  -我們怎么離開這兒
- You got a plan, kid?  - How do we get out of here?

1604
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:17,320
給我二十分鐘先
Give me 20 minutes.

1605
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:25,660
所以莫里森和史密斯那伙人都死了
So, Morrison's dead. Smith and his team are dead.

1606
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:28,790
15分鐘后我們就能找到印刷模板
Another 15 minutes or so, we locate those engraving plates.

1607
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:30,420
你在幸災樂禍嗎
What is this? Are you gloating?

1608
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,880
不  我是在打擊你  誰讓你們背叛了我
No, this is me beating you after you burned me.

1609
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,300
-我們做了交易  記得嗎  -我們沒做交易
- We had a deal, remember?  - Not you and me.

1610
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,130
-你  我  還有莫里森  -我不是直接和你交易
- You, me and Morrison.  - Not you and me, directly.

1611
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,800
所以你倆自己密謀  把我排除在外
And you two collude and cut me out.

1612
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:44,680
你在干嘛  真要在車里殺人嗎
Hey. What are you doing? In the car?

1613
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,270
要在車里殺人嗎
Are we doing... Are we gonna do this in the car?

1614
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,430
-你來殺嗎  -不是  他來
- You doing this?  - He's gonna do it.

1615
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,020
好吧  在這兒死真是不錯
Way to go. That's brilliant, right there.

1616
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,770
你要干嘛  他在干嘛  老天
What are you doing? What is he doing?

1617
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,570
-天啊  -怎么樣了  凱爾  
- Jesus.  - How's it going, Kyle?

1618
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,730
-你還好吧  -還好
- You all right?  - I'm good.

1619
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,610
老兄  你好個鬼  你在干什么
Brother, you are far from good. What are you doing?

1620
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,660
歐版消音器
It's a European silencer.

1621
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,080
逆時針裝消音器  你就那樣拿槍嗎
It's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise. You're holding a gun like that?

1622
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,990
你以前也像這樣拿槍嗎  你居然能活到現在
You've held a gun like that before and you're still here?

1623
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,580
真是奇跡
That's amazing.

1624
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,330
-別指著我  -天啊  當作我最后的請求
- Don't point that thing...  - Jesus. Final request,

1625
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,000
不要讓這家伙開槍打我
don't let this guy shoot me, please.

1626
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,510
如果讓索薩知道我們還活著 
So, if Sosa knows we're alive...

1627
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,050
她就會相信莫里森也還活著
She'll believe Morrison is alive, too.

1628
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:26,100
但愿林奇還在監聽索薩的通訊線路
Let's just hope that Lynch still has Sosa's comm lines.

1629
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,060
我是索薩
This is Sosa.

1630
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:33,770
莫里森將軍在我手里
General Morrison is in my possession.

1631
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,440
什么  抱歉  我聽不清  你是哪位
What? I'm sorry. l can't hear you. Who is this?

1632
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,740
-還沒干掉他呀  -不是吧
- Okay, this was not well thought out.  - No shit.

1633
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,700
看著  我來教你怎么殺我 
I mean, look at this. Am I to teach you how to kill me?

1634
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,490
幫個忙  好嗎  拿起槍管
Hey, do me a favor, all right? Put the barrel...

1635
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,030
拿起槍管對準我的頭
Put the gun flush to my head.

1636
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,870
-確定嗎  -對了  就是這兒
- Are you sure?  - There you go, right there.

1637
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,370
-子彈會橫穿過去嗎  -在你先打傷其他人之前
- Is that going to go through?  - Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1638
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,750
好了  我們沒事了
There you go. We're okay. We're okay.

1639
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,670
絕不要反銬住一個坐著的人
Never cuff a man in a seated position with his hands behind his back.

1640
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,590
這樣就看不到他的手了
Makes it impossible to see the hands.

1641
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,170
太酷了
That was cool.

1642
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,220
-你喜歡嗎  -喜歡
- You like that?  - I like that.

1643
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,880
非常喜歡  
I like that a lot.

1644
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,680
你還好嗎  蠢貨
Are you all right, you idiot?

1645
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,640
-是的  這一下真帶勁  -給他拷上手銬
- Yeah. It was a good hit.  - Please handcuff him.

1646
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,640
我們還要手銬干嘛  不用了
We don't need to use them again. We don't need the cuffs.

1647
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:11,890
你知道自己在和誰說話嗎
Who are you talking to?

1648
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,810
-布拉德  要手機還是要槍  選一個  -天啊
- Brad, phone or gun.  - Jesus.

1649
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:15,000
手機還是槍  選一個
Phone or gun. Pick.

1650
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,360
-把槍放下  -我沒有背叛你  是莫里森的主意
- Put the gun down.  - Hey, l didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1651
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,740
我真想打死你
l really wanna shoot you.

1652
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,820
你得聽這個電話  長官
You gotta hear this, sir.

1653
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,530
你是史密斯嗎 
Is this Smith?

1654
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,410
前上校打給前上尉  真有趣
From a former colonel to a former captain,

1655
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:30,540
我知道大約三十秒你就可以鎖定信號
I know I've got about 30 seconds before you lock this signal.

1656
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:33,750
所以聽著  我們可以證明自己的清白 
So listen, we can prove our innocence.

1657
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,250
好吧  慢點說
Okay. All right. Now, go back.

1658
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,920
你剛說你抓了莫里森將軍嗎
Did you say you have Morrison? You have General Morrison?

1659
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,130
-是的  -他還活著嗎
- Correct.  - You have him alive?

1660
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:44,970
好得很  所以林奇想殺我們滅口
And well, despite Lynch trying to wipe us out wholesale.

1661
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,350
電話里說不清  但莫里森的證詞可以證明我們清白
Too much to explain now but Morrison's testimony frees us

1662
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,270
揭發林奇的罪行
and fries Lynch.

1663
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,400
沒有模板可不行
Well, not without the plates.

1664
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,310
也在我這兒
Also in mypossession.

1665
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,440
記住  林奇以為我們已經死了  不要讓他知道
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead, and I want to keep it that way.

1666
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,990
-好的  成交  -給我支筆
- All right. We'll deal.  - Give me a pen.

1667
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,530
-何時何地  -給我支筆  有誰有筆嗎
- Where and when?  - Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1668
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,410
-洛杉磯碼頭  四十八小時后的凌晨  -你還用筆呀
- LA docks, 48 hours, dawn.  - You still use a pen?

1669
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,950
我把莫里森和模板帶來
I deliver Morrison and the plates.

1670
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,000
作為回報  我要求在民事法庭上重審
In return, I want a retrial in front of a civilian court.

1671
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,670
好  成交 
All right. We'll deal.

1672
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,500
洛杉磯碼頭  四十八小時后見
LA docks, 48 hours from now.

1673
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:25,300
你們若敢耍花招  交易就取消
Any bullshit from your end, and that's it, deal's off.

1674
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:30,470
-找到他了嗎  -沒有
- Did we get him?  - No.

1675
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,430
帕克  
Pike.

1676
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,350
你相信有第二次機會嗎
You believe in second chances?

1677
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:40,400
現在相信了
I do now.

1678
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,480
說太多了嗎
Too much?

1679
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,860
還好  差點就被定位了
I thought you were spot-on.

1680
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,410
該我了
My turn.

1681
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:54,000
小白來電

1682
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,920
收好這部手機
Hold on to that phone.

1683
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,800
我是索薩
This is Sosa.

1684
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,260
你好  美人兒
Hello, beautiful.

1685
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:14,270
謝謝
Thank you.

1686
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,440
他們這下原形畢露了  看怪頭那樣  
They got the raw end of the deal, didn't they? Look at B.A.

1687
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:27,650
跟個大香蕉似的
He looks like a huge banana.

1688
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:30,070
早上好  朋友
Good morning, my friend.

1689
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,160
早上好
Good morning.

1690
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,210
你是賓基·拉賓諾維茲神父嗎
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1691
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:42,840
見鬼  我給錯護照了嗎
What passport did I give you?

1692
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,380
你從坦桑尼亞來的嗎  我媽媽也是坦桑尼亞人
You're from Tanzania. My mother is from Tanzania.

1693
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:46,960
-見鬼  -這什么情況
- Oh, shit.  - What the hell happened?

1694
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,350
-讓非洲人信猶太教  -這里是六號崗臺
- ...converting Africans to Judaism. - This is station six...

1695
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,480
我就是做這些事
Stuff like that.

1696
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,020
準備行動  我右邊有三個
Let's get ready to move. There's three to my right.

1697
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:04,820
后面有兩個  東北出口有一個
There's two behind me and one at the northeast exit.

1698
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,740
等等
Wait a sec.

1699
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,490
祝好
Shalom.

1700
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,830
-他在干嘛  -默多克  正在編他的生平事跡
- What's he doing? - It's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1701
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:27,420
上帝在我心
There is a God.

1702
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,420
-你會說斯瓦希里語嗎  -你不會嗎
- You speak Swahili?  - You don't?

1703
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:32,180
接下去有的忙了嗎  小子
You got enough to work with, kid?

1704
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:33,260
好吧
We will.

1705
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:36,970
咱現在選擇穿過大西洋
You and l have some major favors moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1706
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:40,100
到一艘做黑市交易的深海貨船上去
It's a deep-sea freighter, shipping strictly black-market merch.

1707
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,770
我們怎么離開呢
How do we get out to her?

1708
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,350
我說的就是一艘普通的舊船
A boat. A plain old boat.

1709
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,190
默多克  坐船渡海  太帥了
This is what I'm talking about, Murdock. Traveling the open seas in style.

1710
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:49,740
我就喜歡這種交通工具  沒的比  船這么安全  
This is the way l like to travel. classy-like. The way people used to, safe.

1711
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:50,900
還坐什么飛機
We don't need a plane.

1712
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:54,200
博斯克  但愿有一天我們能幫你克服飛行恐懼癥
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1713
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,370
什么
What?

1714
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:58,120
這原來不是船呀
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1715
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,710
只是今天還不行
Just not today.

1716
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,540
默多克  給我記住
Murdock, don't you remember what l said?

1717
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:06,290
-你得自己背他過去了  -你得自己背他過去了
- I said you have to catch him...  - You have to catch him...

1718
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,460
-你把他弄昏了之后  -你把他弄昏了之后
- ...after you inject him.  - ...after you inject him.

1719
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,800
我錯了
My bad.

1720
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,370
見鬼  我的頭痛死了
Damn it! My head, man.

1721
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:48,460
-你最愛的椰奶咖喱橄欖沙司喲   -快給我  傻蛋
- Coconut- curry tapenade, your favorite.  - Give me that, fool.

1722
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,920
吐司呢
You get them toast points?

1723
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,510
給  吐司這就來了
Voila! Toast points.

1724
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:59,220
你非得又把我弄暈嗎
Y'all knocked me out again, huh?

1725
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:03,180
聽好  把你弄昏的是
Okay, now, the whole injection, knocking out,

1726
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,690
漢尼拔和小白
Hannibal and Face.

1727
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,810
而我是給你做咖喱橄欖沙司滴
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1728
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:11,900
但我明明是臉朝地摔倒的  
Why do l feel like l fell on my face?

1729
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,110
還騙我
Huh? Tell me that.

1730
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,660
林奇是個矛盾體  
Lynch is a paradox.

1731
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,620
默多克  你發現了嗎
Murdock, you done with that?

1732
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:26,210
他本該匿名工作  卻偏喜歡受人關注
This is a guy who needs anonymity, but he loves theatricality.

1733
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,210
他是個行政官員  不是個執行者 
He's an administrator, he's not an operator.

1734
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,970
在哪兒
Where is it?

1735
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,010
漂亮
Very nice.

1736
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,760
所以他總是盡力遠離現場
So he stays as far away from the point of impact as possible,

1737
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,180
絕不會直接參與進去
and never gets his hands dirty if he can help it.

1738
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:45,810
但我們要改變現狀
But we're gonna change all that.

1739
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,560
你騙不了一個職業騙子
You can't hustle a hustler, fool.

1740
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,070
這玩意不能靠近火星和火苗  甚至閃光燈都不行
No sparks, no flames, not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1741
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,650
慢點
Easy, easy.

1742
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:59,910
這家伙絕不會出現在事發現場
This guy is never at the flashpoint of anything.

1743
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,200
而是在幕后高枕無憂地暗中操縱
He's safe and sound somewhere, pulling the strings.

1744
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,370
媽媽
Mama. Mama.

1745
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,750
頭兒  為什么搞得這么麻煩
Hey, boss. Why so many of these damn things anyway?

1746
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,880
因為亂花漸欲迷人眼  伙計
Because overkill is underrated, my friend.

1747
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:19,260
所以我們要揭開那家伙的保護繭
So we're gonna bring this guy down to ground level.

1748
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:20,720
媽媽
Mama. Mama.

1749
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,100
林奇  這邊
This way, Lynch. Lynch.

1750
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,730
他最害怕的一點
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1751
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:33,020
就是自己在眾目睽睽下被揭露真面目
Then you put him on display for the whole world to see.

1752
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,530
還有問題嗎
Any questions?

1753
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,240
怎么了  頭兒 
What's up, boss man?

1754
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:41,700
怪頭
Hey, B.A.

1755
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:44,080
這次任務艱巨吧
It's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1756
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:48,370
這我也說不好
Well, I can't promise you it won't.

1757
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:51,580
給你讀個東西  就一句
Let me read you something real quick.

1758
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:55,710
以暴力取勝  意味著失敗  
"Victory attained by violence is tantamount to defeat,

1759
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,670
因為這只是短暫的勝利
"for it is momentary."

1760
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:01,470
甘地
Gandhi.

1761
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:06,310
若是心中存在暴力  就把它發泄出來
"It is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts,

1762
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:09,730
這要勝過用非暴力來掩飾心中的脆弱
"than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence."

1763
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:13,810
這是誰說的
Who said that?

1764
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:15,440
還是甘地
Same guy.

1765
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:19,990
甘地從不懼怕為自己的信仰而戰
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight for the things he believed in.

1766
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,240
你又信仰什么  怪頭
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1767
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:46,350
人生如戲
For life is but an opera

1768
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:51,310
跑調了  是不
It's off, isn't it?

1769
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,440
應該唱得更高點是吧
I think it's higher.

1770
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:58,070
還不錯了  
No, it's good. It's not that, Murdock.

1771
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:59,610
小白  怎么了
Face, what's wrong? Come on, man.

1772
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,990
我也不知道  只是在想
l don't know, man. I'm just thinking past this.

1773
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:07,240
這一路上  我們每次都能全身而退
You know, we've always come back alive,

1774
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:11,040
都虧了老家伙的巧妙計劃
the four of us, 'cause of the old man.

1775
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,460
-我知道  -但我不是他
- l know.  - I'm not him.

1776
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,120
小白  我知道
Face, l know this.

1777
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,340
默多克  我不是漢尼拔
Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1778
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,960
這次行動誰的犧牲會最大  
Who has the most to lose on this, Face?

1779
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,510
是我  
Me.

1780
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,470
但我相信你
And I trust you.

1781
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,770
我明白
Yeah, l know,

1782
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:32,140
但是  你就是個瘋子
but you're crazy.

1783
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:38,480
還沒那么瘋
Not that crazy.

1784
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
洛杉磯港

1785
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
西漢堡號

1786
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:58,170
所有目標差不多到了  
Our eagles may have landed.

1787
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,380
大家準備好了嗎
Everybody ready to roll?

1788
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:00,750
收到  第一小隊準備行動
Copy Team one on the move.

1789
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,550
收到  第二小隊按計劃行事
Acknowledged. Team to en route.

1790
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:12,310
好啦  大家準備好了嗎  
All right, guys, everybody ready?

1791
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,850
好戲就要開幕了
Curtain's about to come up.

1792
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,310
演出開始
Show time.

1793
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,780
史密斯就在那里  盯緊他
That's Smith right there. Watch him.

1794
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,660
所有小隊都到位了嗎
Ground team is in position?

1795
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,160
準備就緒
Standing by.

1796
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:33,790
已經就位
In position.

1797
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:38,040
一隊狙擊手就位
Shoot Team One. Affirmative.

1798
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:39,880
一號觀測員  10到8點鐘方向
Spotter One. 10-8.

1799
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,250
注意聽好了
Let's chattermark on comms for now.

1800
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,050
莫里森是首要目標  模板就在集裝箱里
Morrison's the primary tango. Plates are the package.

1801
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,680
好了  他在跟索薩通話  把電話轉過來
Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa. I want this call.

1802
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:53,680
你騙我們  我們說好的
You lied to me, Sosa. We had a deal.

1803
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:55,850
快把那該死的電話轉給我  謝謝
I want that goddamn call in my... Thank you.

1804
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,100
是說好了  但我改了主意
We had a deal, but I'm changing the deal.

1805
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:00,190
耍我嗎  索薩
Are you kidding me, Sosa? Are you kidding me?

1806
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:03,280
情況起了復雜的變化  現在不由你了
This is a complicated exchange and you have no play here.

1807
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,490
聽著  不然就一輩子
Listen, or remain at-large fugitives

1808
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:07,650
-繼續做你的通緝犯  -哦 不
- for the foreseeable future.  - Uh oh. No! No, no.

1809
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:10,070
行行好  我已經把莫里森和模板帶來了
For God sakes, I've got Morrison here and the plates.

1810
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,580
我已經暴露了  索薩  暴露了
I'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!

1811
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,330
我們不在碼頭上交易
We're not doing this on the docks.

1812
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,040
給我聽好了  我們絕不會自首
Now listen to me, we're not turning ourselves in.

1813
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,670
給我聽好了  我們絕不會自首
Now you listen to me, we're not turning ourselves in.

1814
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,080
你必須按我的條件來  不然就沒的談
I need you to do it on my terms or nothing at all.

1815
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:23,000
去你媽的  見鬼去吧  索薩
To hell with that, and to hell with you, Sosa!

1816
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,210
她背叛了他
Ah. She burned him.

1817
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:27,840
小白  怪頭  我們撤  索薩耍了我們
Face, B.A., we're bugging out. Sosa's jammed us.

1818
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:30,890
默多克  放下十號位的箱子
Murdock, get the chopper down here in 10.

1819
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:34,350
他在轉移他  
Okay, he's moving him.

1820
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:35,680
盯緊他  他要轉移了
You got him? He's moving him.

1821
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:37,480
老天爺  你別緊張
For the love of God, relax.

1822
01:51:37,770 --> 01:51:39,770
我沒緊張  在轉移了
I am relaxed. He's moving him.

1823
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:41,730
不要這樣  漢尼拔  求你了
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.

1824
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:44,860
-那兒  莫里森就在那兒  殺了他  -等下  他拿了模板嗎
- That's Morrison, right there. Take him.  - Wait, does he have the plates?

1825
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,360
模板在史密斯手里  快行動
Smith has the plates. Go now.

1826
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,150
-干掉他  他就在那兒  開槍  -我來搞定莫里森  準備射擊  
- Take him, he's right there. Kill him.  - I've got Morrison, taking a shot.

1827
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:54,240
剛剛真險  小子
A little too close for comfort, kid.

1828
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,620
剛才怎么了
What just happened?

1829
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,160
天殺的他究竟想干嘛
What the hell is he doing?

1830
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,290
他們人呢  誰來告訴我
Where are they? Somebody talk to me.

1831
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:01,330
見鬼  那東西把他們壓死了嗎
Come on, did that thing crush them or what?

1832
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:06,050
好吧  玩三個塑料杯可比這個簡單多了
This was a hell of a lot easier when it was just three plastic cups.

1833
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,180
大家冷靜下來  提高警惕  不要魯莽
Everybody just be cool. Pay attention. No hasty moves.

1834
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:18,310
要打敗林奇那樣的人  有三個關鍵要素
So, you beat a guy like Lynch by drawing him in with three things.

1835
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:20,310
奇了怪了  他們到底要干嘛
What the hell are they doing?

1836
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,520
聲東擊西
Distraction.

1837
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:26,000
到底怎么回事
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1838
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:30,070
調虎離山
Diversion.

1839
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,120
這是要調虎離山  別亂  目標在集裝箱里
This is a diversion! Stay eagle on those containers.

1840
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,000
他們要借此逃跑  快開火
They're breaking for the exits! Open fire!

1841
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,830
不要暴露  回撤
Do not engage! Back off!

1842
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,580
地面隊伍  開槍
Ground teams, engage!

1843
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:48,760
他媽的
Holy shit!

1844
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,850
地面隊伍  開槍
Ground team, re-engage.

1845
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,600
你被史密斯耍了  他是想要
You are being played by Smith.

1846
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:00,560
吸引你的注意力  林奇  放聰明點
He's trying to draw your eye line, Lynch. Come on, be smart.

1847
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,850
抓住他  抓住他  快去
Take them! Take them! Take them! Take them!

1848
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:08,280
注意塔身還有塔腰  是派克和拜庫斯
Contact! Tower house and bow! It's Peck and Baracus!

1849
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:16,160
還要能全身而退
And division.

1850
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:20,250
這是個陷阱  快撤退  
It's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1851
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:22,080
-他媽的快離開那兒  -不
- Get the hell out of there!  - No, no, no.

1852
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:30,710
這是怎么了  到底怎么回事
What is happening? What is going on?

1853
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,550
這計劃不錯  小子
Nice one, kid.

1854
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,260
是派克和拜庫斯 
It's Peck and Baracus!

1855
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,930
-快開槍  -閉嘴  我知道該怎么做
- Shoot them!  - Shut up! l know what I'm doing.

1856
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:38,720
夠了  小朋友們  該我上了
Okay, paintballers, time to go pro.

1857
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,600
怪頭  執行下一步計劃
B.A., get to your secondary position.

1858
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,230
好了  扭轉局面的人來了  
Okay. Game-changer.

1859
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,230
你們該適可而止了
Here's what l think of your best-laid plans.

1860
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,400
媽的
Shit!

1861
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:58,700
我的天吶
Jesus Christ!

1862
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,450
偉大戰略家史密斯的計謀就到此終止了
So much for the grand scheme, Smith.

1863
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,660
他媽的到底怎么了
What the hell was that?

1864
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,540
怎么回事  小白  
Face, what the hell was that?

1865
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:07,670
他給船身開了個窟窿  
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW! He punched a hole in the hull!

1866
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,170
那計劃怎么辦
What about the plan?

1867
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,710
帕克把計劃給搞亂了  這是意外狀況
Pike just blew up the plan! We are ad-libbing!

1868
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,170
博斯克  快走
Bosco, get out of there!

1869
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,590
我去找漢尼拔
I'm going for Hannibal.

1870
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,590
-掩護我  我去找模板  -遵命
- Cover me. I'm going for those plates.  - Yes, sir.

1871
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,890
船要沉了  快走
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

1872
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:26,440
抓緊
Bos, hang on!

1873
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,170
天呀
Oh! Jeez!

1874
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:16,460
靠
Shit.

1875
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:19,920
博斯克  帕克占據有利位置  我快沒子彈了
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground. I'm running low on ammo, man.

1876
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,560
媽的
Shit!

1877
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:35,900
怎么了  帥哥  
How are you doing, handsome?

1878
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:38,650
你的槍還他媽能使嗎
Shit, can you cycle that weapon. Nice work.

1879
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,610
戰友和子彈  
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1880
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,070
最需要他們的時候都去哪兒了呢
Where are they when you need them?

1881
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:48,120
我和你沒私仇  但看著這兒   
Don't take this too personally, but look here,

1882
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,000
笑一笑  等著槍響
smile, wait for the flash.

1883
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,670
拜庫斯
Baracus.

1884
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:08,680
博斯克
Bosco!

1885
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,490
林奇
Lynch.

1886
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:31,540
林奇
Lynch.

1887
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:35,880
來吧  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1888
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:40,880
林奇
Lynch.

1889
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,970
出來吧  史密斯  別裝神弄鬼了
Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

1890
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:48,720
來呀  林奇
Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

1891
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:54,480
林奇
Lynch...

1892
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,520
你找得到我嗎
Where am l?

1893
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:01,230
來呀  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1894
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:05,280
林奇
Lynch.

1895
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:07,950
來找我吧  林奇
Where am l, Lynch?

1896
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:11,120
來呀  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1897
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,370
林奇  林奇
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1898
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,250
林奇
Lynch!

1899
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:36,100
終于找到你了  漢尼拔  你可真難找
There you are, Hannibal. Been looking all over for you.

1900
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:39,270
別以為我是白面小生  
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1901
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,440
我的泰拳還有兩下子  柔術還更好一點呢  但是
My muay Thai is pretty good. My jujitsu is a little better, but...

1902
01:58:43,610 --> 01:58:47,410
我手上這些功夫  比起那些集裝箱啊車啊爆炸啊
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing going with the containers

1903
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:50,950
裝神弄鬼啊什么的  還真是小巫見大巫  
and the cars, and the fireworks. "Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1904
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:57,120
真他媽煩人  但老天給了帕克一個火箭筒
God, that's annoying. But you give Pike a rocket.

1905
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,540
你沒想到吧
There's your monkey wrench.

1906
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
漢尼拔  別這樣
Hannibal, don't do this.

1907
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:06,380
你知道嗎  史密斯  本來一切都照你的計劃進行
You know, Smith, you could have the best recipe in the world...

1908
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:08,340
-你欠我這么多  -可惜你千算萬算
- You owe me that much.  - ...but you drop a few bullets

1909
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:10,050
-漏算一著  -漢尼拔  別這樣
- into the batter...  - Hannibal, don't do this.

1910
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,310
-林奇  不要  -漢尼拔  別
- Lynch, no!  - Hannibal, please.

1911
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:13,720
天
Oh, God.

1912
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,600
天不遂人愿
...and that cake don't bake.

1913
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:21,400
人證物證  都齊了  這下你有麻煩了
Uh-oh. Your witness, your gun, your problem.

1914
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:27,360
你也算報效祖國了  抱歉
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1915
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,040
好久不見  錢先生  我可等死你了
Hello, Ben, where have you been all my life?

1916
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:41,330
漢尼拔  看看  兩成年男子對決
Look at us, Hannibal. Couple of grown men.

1917
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:43,880
你流血了  你居然流血了 
I'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

1918
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:46,710
別起來
Don't get up.

1919
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:54,760
操你媽
God damn it!

1920
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:58,140
你的泰拳和柔術都那么差勁  林奇
Your muay Thai is as bad as your jujitsu, Lynch.

1921
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,060
你必須靠槍才行
Better stick with a gun.

1922
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:05,400
要是有把裝彈的槍你就死定了
You put a loaded weapon in my hand, I'll put a bullet in your head.

1923
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:23,790
我說過我會殺了你
I told you l would shoot you.

1924
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:26,960
防彈衣救了你一命
Kevlar saved your life.

1925
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:30,130
問題是  要是瞄準你的頭  這玩意還頂個球用
Thing is, it doesn't do much good if I pop you in the head.

1926
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:32,340
我要能與防彈衣合為一體的話可就不一定了
It does if you melt it down.

1927
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:35,510
漢尼拔  別這樣
Hannibal, don't do this.

1928
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:37,770
-漢尼拔  別  -要打敗林奇那樣的人
- Hannibal, please.  - So, you beat a guy like that

1929
02:00:37,850 --> 02:00:39,810
有三個關鍵要素
by drawing him in with three things.

1930
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,900
-聲東擊西  -怎么回事
- Distraction.  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1931
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,480
調虎離山
Diversion.

1932
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:46,110
全身而退
And division.

1933
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:53,820
在眾目睽睽下揭露他的真面目
Then you put him on display for the whole world to see.

1934
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,620
搞毛
What the...

1935
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,640
真不錯
That's good.

1936
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:18,260
真令人驚訝
Surprise.

1937
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,850
布里斯特工
Agent Burress.

1938
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,690
你叫我什么
What did you call me?

1939
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,560
文斯·布里斯特工  不是你的名字嗎
Agent Vance Burress? lsn't that your name?

1940
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:29,190
至少我的逮捕令上是這么寫的
At least that's the name I've got on this warrant here,

1941
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,450
除非你有和這張一模一樣的 
and unless you have a piece of paper that looks exactly like...

1942
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,570
真好笑  這是我曾說過的話
That's funny. That's what l said.

1943
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,200
以我之道還施我身
She's quoting me.

1944
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:39,160
慢慢來
Easy, easy.

1945
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:43,250
你被捕了  罪名是蓄意制造虛假謀殺
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

1946
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,290
以及盜竊政府最高機密的
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

1947
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:48,880
美鈔模板
and the theft of top secret government engraving plates.

1948
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:50,380
慢慢起來
Easy.

1949
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,130
看來這計劃還算順利
l guess the plan went okay,

1950
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:58,810
只是我沒考慮到帕克會把船給炸了
considering Pike did blow up the boat, which l didn't account for at all.

1951
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,890
子彈沒打穿呢
Bullets didn't go through.

1952
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:05,690
伙計  覺得怎樣
How are you feeling, man?

1953
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,400
不好  很不好
Not... Not good.

1954
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:09,520
-怎么了  -不舒服
- What's wrong? - Not good.

1955
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,780
我感覺精神正常了
I feel sane.

1956
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:14,320
早知道我早該往你腦袋上來一槍
I should have shot you in the head a long time ago.

1957
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,160
我怎么覺得你害怕了
Is it crazy that I'm feeling your anxiety right now?

1958
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,240
我看起來像害怕的樣嗎
Do I look anxious to you?

1959
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,240
你覺得我被打敗了嗎
You think I'm beaten?

1960
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:23,580
我只是在流血  沒有流虛汗
I'm bleeding, l'm not sweating.

1961
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:26,710
把他帶走  
Let's take him out of here, guys. Go ahead, princess.

1962
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:34,470
腦震蕩和撞傷有什么區別嗎
What's the difference between a concussion and a contusion?

1963
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:38,010
-沒事的  伙計  -默多克  干得不錯
-It don't matter, bro. You tore up.  - Murdock, that was beautiful.

1964
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,680
你沒事  頭盔很有用嘛
You were right. The helmet worked.

1965
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,760
番茄醬立功了
Ketchup worked great.

1966
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:44,680
你表現真棒  現在感覺怎么樣
You did a great job. You okay?

1967
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:45,940
-還好  -清醒點了嗎
- Yeah.  -  Got your bell rung?

1968
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:49,690
下次還是讓漢尼拔制定計劃吧
Just let Hannibal make the plans next time.

1969
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:52,320
-好吧  -好吧
- Oh. Okay.  - Okay.

1970
02:02:52,650 --> 02:02:54,280
你的良心感覺怎么樣  大塊頭
How's the conscience, big guy?

1971
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:57,280
平靜如水
At peace.

1972
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:09,080
別熄火
Keep it turning.

1973
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,340
我們要帶走他們
We already got them on the exits.

1974
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:14,010
現在方圓3公里都被封鎖了  -索薩是哪位
- We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.  - Which one of you is Sosa?

1975
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:15,670
-我是  -我要找索薩
- I am. I am. - I need to talk to Sosa.

1976
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,510
從現在開始  你的囚犯將遣回
As of right now your prisoner is to be remanded

1977
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,430
-聯邦關押  -我有他的逮捕令  
- into federal custody.  - l have a warrant for this man.

1978
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:22,100
-現在  -我來告訴你吧  我是醫生
-  As of right now...  - I'll tell you what... I'm a doc.

1979
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,680
讓我來治療你  我來幫你
Let me doctor you up. Let me help you out.

1980
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:26,020
你要縫針吧  
Do you need stitches? Please tell me you need stitches.

1981
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,520
我會幫你縫得很好喲
l can stitch you up really good.

1982
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:30,480
先生們
Gentlemen.

1983
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:33,980
中情局
The Central lntelligence Agency

1984
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,400
秉持高度的倫理道德
believes in and evinces a profound moral ethic,

1985
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:38,740
和堅定不移的職業標準
as well as an unshakeable professional standard.

1986
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:42,990
因此  我們為發生的一切
As such, we would like to extend our most sincere apologies

1987
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,490
向你們表達最誠摯的歉意
for what's happened here.

1988
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:48,790
-祝你們好運  -你們要帶他去哪里
- Good day and God bless.  - Where are you taking him?

1989
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,590
你說誰
Who?

1990
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,340
我不知道你的名字
I never got your name.

1991
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:03,600
我叫林奇
My name is Lynch.

1992
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:07,060
果然
Of course it is.

1993
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:11,020
他剛剛是說林奇嗎
Did he just say Lynch?

1994
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,490
別碰我
Hey. Do not touch me.

1995
02:04:25,330 --> 02:04:26,620
別緊張  伙計們
Take it easy, guys.

1996
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:29,370
所有人都給我退下
Everybody, stand down! Stand down!

1997
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:32,380
-去把拿上模板  -所有人給我退下
-Get those plates. - Everybody, stand down!

1998
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:35,210
-這是命令  給我退下  -你想干什么
- That's an order. Hey, you, stand down. -  What is wrong with you?

1999
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:36,500
中尉
Lieutenant.

2000
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:37,760
長官  你是幾時到的  我不知道
Sir, when did you arrive? l had no idea...

2001
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,720
-給我點時間  -遵命
- Just give me a minute.  - Yes, sir.

2002
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,300
把你的手拿開  肌肉男
FACE: Get your hands off me, tough guy.

2003
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:50,310
雖然搞得一團糟  但我們好歹拿回了模板
Well, that's one hell of a mess. But we did get the plates.

2004
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:54,980
但不幸的是  我得以逃脫合法監禁的罪名控告你們
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to charge you all with escaping lawful custody.

2005
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,770
什么  漢尼拔  那家伙在說什么
What? Hannibal, what is this guy talking about?

2006
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:00,570
怪頭  雖然是誤判  但我們越獄還是違法的
B.A., we were wrongly convicted, but it's still illegal to break out ofjail.

2007
02:05:00,650 --> 02:05:01,990
長官  史密斯他們為這次行動
Director McCready, Smith and his team

2008
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,530
立下汗馬功勞
were instrumental in recovering those plates.

2009
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:07,700
但他們仍是十級通緝犯  必須逮捕他們
They're still level-10 federal fugitives and l need that off my desk.

2010
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:09,790
這真他媽扯淡  長官
This is chickenshit, sir.

2011
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,290
也許對他們是很扯淡  
Yeah, well, you know what? Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

2012
02:05:12,370 --> 02:05:15,750
但是對你  上尉  我們決定將你重新升為上尉
but for you, Captain, we're re-promoting you to your former rank.

2013
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,170
他們馬上會被轉移
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

2014
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,800
交給長灘市的聯邦法警
to the U.S. Marshals Service here in Long Beach.

2015
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,720
-以最高的安全級別運走他們  -我理解  但
-And there should be a C-5 transport... -l understand, but...

2016
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,090
半小時后起飛
...on the tarmac in half an hour.

2017
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,590
-這勢在必行  -這很不公平長官
- This needs to be done. - This is really unfair, sir.

2018
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:27,350
-真他媽扯蛋  -我可是胡迪尼大師
- This is bullshit.  - I'm like Harry Houdini.

2019
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:27,350
逃脫術大師

2020
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:29,060
這手銬我很容易就能咬開
I chew through your cuffs.

2021
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:31,890
-起身  前進  進去  -往前走
- Get up. Step up. Get in there!  - Step up!

2022
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:34,230
-行動起來  -等下  停一下
- Let's go. Get moving. - Stop. Wait, stop.

2023
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,020
-走  -等等
- Move it. -Wait.

2024
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:38,270
-這太沒道理了  -不用擔心
- This is so wrong.  - It got a little aggressive.

2025
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:39,860
-不用擔心  -現在這樣真的大錯特錯了
- Don't worry about it.  - This is really, really wrong,

2026
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:42,450
我會不惜一切代價來彌補  
and I'm going to do everything l can to fix it.

2027
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:45,110
-我相信你  -我真的很抱歉  小白
- I know you will.  - I'm so sorry, Face.

2028
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,690
這計劃真不錯  小白
Nice plan, Face.

2029
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,030
好個毛  才抓住林奇  結果我們又進了監獄
Yeah. We just traded Lynches, and we're going back to prison.

2030
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,080
我們交還了模板  這下能抬頭做人了
We returned the plates. We can hold our heads high.

2031
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:30,370
我們做了應該做的
We did the right thing.

2032
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:33,620
但他們卻這樣對待我們  真他媽的
Yeah, and look what they did to us. This is some bullshit.

2033
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,870
他們又拋棄了我們  漢尼拔  
They burned us again, Hannibal.

2034
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,790
我們相信國家機關  但他們卻恩將仇報
We trusted the system and it turned on us.

2035
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:42,000
記住  小子們  無論表面上看起來多么混亂
Remember, boys, no matter how random things might appear,

2036
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:44,630
本質上總是有計劃存在  小子
there is still a plan. Kid.

2037
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:49,350
我不是故意搶你臺詞  頭兒  不過
Well, l don't mean to steal your line, boss, but...

2038
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:59,610
我就愛計劃圓滿的那一刻
I love it when a plan comes together.

2039
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:06,740
依舊被政府通緝
Still wanted by the government,

2040
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,950
但這些戰士們  一次次地神奇逃脫
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

2041
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:14,250
如果你遇到困難
lf you have a problem,

2042
02:07:15,250 --> 02:07:17,250
如果你走投無路
if no one else can help,

2043
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:20,210
你要是能找到他們  
and if you can find them,

2044
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:22,210
或許就能雇傭
maybe you can hire

2045
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,260
天龍特攻隊
the A-Team.
