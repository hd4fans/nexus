1
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,002
Dad...

2
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,518
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds! God be with you!

3
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,770
Port side, stick. Starboard side, stick.

4
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,190
Move fast and clear those mortar holes.

5
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,026
l want to see plenty of beach between men.

6
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,988
Five men is an opportunity. One is a waste of ammo.

7
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:49,365
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

8
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,201
Keep those actions clear.

9
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,328
l'll see you on the beach.

10
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,404
Open mortar holes!

11
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,130
Over the side!

12
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:54,722
Port and starboard, over...

13
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,501
Jesus.

14
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,920
Thank you...

15
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,687
l said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

16
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,232
Captain Miller!

17
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,317
Captain Miller!

18
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,320
Captain Miller!

19
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,240
Sergeant Horvath!

20
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,492
Move your men off the beach!

21
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,202
Go!

22
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:46,246
OK, you guys!

23
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,290
Get on my ass! Follow me!

24
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:51,125
What's the rallying point?

25
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,253
Anywhere but here!

26
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,225
The sea wall!

27
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:08,852
Move up to the sea wall!

28
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,728
Sir, l'm staying!

29
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,898
Clear this beach! Make way for the others!

30
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,276
This is all we got!

31
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:20,363
Every inch of this beach has been pre-sighted!

32
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,033
You stay here, you're dead men!

33
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,965
Mama!

34
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:40,675
Mama!

35
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,974
Stay down! Stay down!

36
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,147
What are you guys?

37
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,192
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

38
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,736
Here to set up field operations!

39
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,654
Get rid of that crap!

40
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:04,991
Grab yourselves some weapons. Follow me.

41
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,249
l'm hit!

42
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,500
Briggs!

43
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:20,882
Get me out!

44
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,593
l'm hit low. God!

45
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,178
Medic!

46
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,222
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

47
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:30,141
l gotta clear these obstacles for the tanks.

48
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,685
All the armour's foundering in the Channel.

49
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,020
Orders, sir.

50
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:36,731
You go somewhere else. l'm clearing this one!

51
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:37,982
Come on, Briggs!

52
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,322
Medic!

53
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,902
Move! Move!

54
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:33,037
Move! Come on!

55
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:34,497
Move!

56
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,978
Shore party.

57
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,980
No armour has made it ashore.

58
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:01,149
We got no DD tanks.

59
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:04,235
Dog One is not open.

60
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,779
Who's in command here?

61
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,865
You are, sir!

62
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,701
- Sergeant Horvath! - Sir!

63
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,995
You recognise where we are?

64
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,498
Right where we're supposed to be, but no one else is!

65
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,168
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

66
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,920
Shore party.

67
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,589
First wave, ineffective.

68
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:30,094
We do not hold the beach. Say again, we do not hold the beach.

69
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:33,348
Sir, we got the leftovers from Fox Company,

70
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,308
Able Company and George Company!

71
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,604
Plus we got some Navy Demo guys and a Beachmaster!

72
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,231
Shore party.

73
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,650
Shore party.

74
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,116
Cat-F, Cat-F, C...

75
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,622
- Reiben here, sir! - Anybody else?

76
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,290
Jackson, but that's about it.

77
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:01,626
Mellish here.

78
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,836
Caparzo! DeForest's back with Wade.

79
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,215
He's hurt so bad he says he sprung 100 leaks.

80
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:09,425
Wade says he's all used up.

81
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,219
Find somebody you can help.

82
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:14,639
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

83
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,435
Get his attention.

84
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,520
Wade!

85
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:21,563
Yo, doc!

86
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:24,023
Wade!

87
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:33,032
Get him off the beach.

88
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,326
l got it! We stopped the bleeding!

89
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,954
We stopped the bleeding!

90
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,497
Fuck!

91
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:43,418
Just give us a fucking chance, you son of a bitch!

92
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,461
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

93
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,047
Come on, Wade! lt's Mellish!

94
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,924
Wade!

95
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,846
We found Miller! Let's move! Let's move!

96
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,974
Oh, God. Oh, God.

97
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:05,148
This is all? This is all that's made it?

98
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,983
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.

99
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,943
There's bound to be more.

100
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:11,654
Not enough. This is not enough.

101
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,947
Dog One exit...

102
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,408
On the right. Or is it left? Shit!

103
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:19,287
No, Vierville is west of us. This is Dog One.

104
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,788
They're killing us!

105
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:24,167
We don't have a fucking chance, and that ain't fair!

106
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,502
Gather weapons and ammo!

107
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,214
Gather weapons and ammo!

108
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:32,383
Come on, drag 'em in off the sand!

109
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,810
Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,

110
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:44,395
where's your BAR?

111
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,273
Bottom of the channel, sir. Nearly drowned me.

112
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,317
Find a replacement.

113
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,239
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

114
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:57,492
Grenades, grenades!

115
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,244
Get 'em over here!

116
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,706
Bangalores up the line!

117
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,875
Bangalores up the line!

118
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,253
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

119
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,547
Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,714
Jackson here, sir!

121
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,007
Reiben back, sir!

122
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,976
One more. Give me one more.

123
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,190
Oh, my God, it hurts!

124
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,608
l'm gonna die!

125
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:33,111
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

126
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,320
Oh, my God!

127
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,407
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

128
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,200
Almost got it.

129
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,285
Jesus!

130
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,121
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,498
Keep it moving. You got it?

132
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:49,168
God! God, help me!

133
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,588
You're not gonna die.

134
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,424
You're fine. Don't look at it.

135
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:58,261
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

136
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:02,557
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

137
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,239
We're in business! Defilade!

138
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,241
Other side of the hole!

139
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,923
That's it! Let's go!

140
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,428
lnspected. Morphine.

141
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,391
Routine.

142
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,273
Priority.

143
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:56,945
He's gone.

144
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,210
Son of a...

145
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:14,379
Get in there.

146
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:15,838
Fuck. l can't move.

147
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,966
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

148
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,446
Two MG-42s and two mortars.

149
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,657
Add 20, left 30.

150
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,953
There's a little defilade,

151
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:50,290
but it's the perfect position if we get some armour.

152
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,251
We gotta open up this draw! Get this draw open.

153
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:55,336
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

154
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,506
Grab some cover and put some fire on that crew.

155
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,552
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk, get ready.

156
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,055
Covering fire!

157
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:11,936
Go, go, go!

158
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,118
Goddamn firing squad.

159
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:30,455
lt's the only way we can get everybody out.

160
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,999
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!

161
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,918
You're next!

162
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,380
- Why not hand out blindfolds? - All we'll do here is die.

163
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,299
Covering fire!

164
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,720
Go, go, go!

165
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,804
Come on!

166
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,723
Come on! Come on!

167
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,225
Go, Goddamit!

168
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,155
Jackson.

169
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,240
Sir.

170
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,950
See that impact crater?

171
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,159
Yes, sir.

172
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:12,372
That should give complete defilade from that machine gun.

173
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,707
Wait for my command.

174
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,047
Go!

175
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,728
Captain, if your mother saw that, she'd be very upset.

176
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:38,439
l thought you were my mother.

177
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,985
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

178
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,450
My God, l am sorry for offending Thee.

179
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:55,373
l detest my sins for having offended Thee, O Lord.

180
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:56,583
Listen to me, Lord.

181
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,757
All my strength...

182
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,718
haste Thee to help me.

183
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,570
Dog One exit! Right here!

184
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,363
We're in business!

185
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,617
Move! Move!

186
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:12,742
Reiben.

187
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,286
- Let's go, sarge. Go! - Reiben.

188
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,983
Come on, Doyle!

189
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,027
Sarge.

190
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,701
Flame!

191
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:56,578
Doyle, do it!

192
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:03,918
Don't shoot! Let 'em burn!

193
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:28,193
''Comrade?'' You son of a bitch!

194
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,237
Lie down!

195
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,726
Cease fire! Cease fire!

196
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:02,769
Cut it out!

197
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:05,355
Cut it out! Cease fire!

198
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,941
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie Three.

199
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:11,110
Say again, Dog One is open. Send in the dozers.

200
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:14,781
l'm waiting to tie in my flanks. Over.

201
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,407
What?

202
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:22,789
What? l'm sorry, l can't understand you.

203
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:33,174
What'd he say? What'd he say?

204
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:36,177
''Look, l washed for supper.''

205
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,025
- Hey, Fish. - Yeah?

206
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:54,737
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

207
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,198
Now it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

208
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,002
Keep it moving!

209
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:11,356
That's quite a view.

210
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,192
Yes, it is.

211
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,695
Quite a view.

212
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,167
''Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

213
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,002
''no doubt you have received information...''

214
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,295
''Dear Mrs Jensen...''

215
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:58,963
''..the death of your son.''

216
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:00,757
''..no words can relieve the grief...''

217
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,134
''We have felt his loss tremendously.''

218
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:06,179
''He was a fine soldier...''

219
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:07,889
''We were involved

220
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:11,142
''in one of the most important operations of this war.''

221
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:13,186
''Al held us all together.

222
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:14,979
''He was always first to volunteer...''

223
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,773
''..came to a clearing

224
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,525
''where 4,000 troops had passed.''

225
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:21,110
''Your husband served in a unit

226
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,738
''whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond...''

227
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:26,741
''..we all cherish and hold so dear.

228
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:30,745
''The loss of Lee and others like him is a distinct blow.''

229
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:32,914
''l understand your desire

230
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:36,751
''to learn about circumstances leading to his death.''

231
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:32,098
Colonel, l've got something you should know about.

232
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,187
These two men died in Normandy.

233
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,189
This one at Omaha beach.

234
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,649
Sean Ryan.

235
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,985
This man at Utah.

236
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:46,821
Peter Ryan.

237
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:53,786
This man was killed last week in New Guinea.

238
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,957
Daniel...

239
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,334
Ryan.

240
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,211
The three are brothers, sir.

241
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:03,213
l've just learned that this afternoon

242
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,757
their mother will get all three telegrams.

243
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,347
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.

244
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,184
He parachuted in the night before the invasion.

245
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,144
He's somewhere in Normandy.

246
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:21,523
- ls he alive? - We don't know.

247
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,527
Come with me.

248
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:13,009
'Goddamit.'

249
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:17,388
All four were in the 29th Division, but we split them up

250
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:20,433
after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau.

251
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,727
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

252
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:27,148
No, sir. He was dropped about 15 miles inland near Neuville.

253
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:29,150
That's still deep behind German lines.

254
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:33,154
There's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.

255
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:37,742
First reports out of SHAEF said the 101st is scattered to hell.

256
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:39,786
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

257
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:43,498
Assuming Ryan survived the jump, he could be anywhere.

258
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,125
ln fact, he's probably KlA.

259
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:50,129
And frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission,

260
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:53,007
flat-hatting through swarms of German reinforcements

261
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:54,759
along our axis of advance,

262
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,636
they're gonna be KlA, too.

263
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,786
l have a letter here...

264
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:27,166
written a long time ago to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

265
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,377
So bear with me.

266
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,423
''Dear Madam,

267
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:37,427
''l have been shown in the files of the War Department

268
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,805
''a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts

269
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,184
''that you are the mother of five...

270
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:49,814
''sons who died gloriously on the field of battle.

271
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:57,947
''l feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine

272
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:01,075
''that would attempt to beguile you from the grief

273
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,163
''of a loss so overwhelming.

274
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:07,749
''But l cannot refrain from tendering to you

275
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:11,169
''the consolation that may be found

276
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:15,798
''in the thanks of the republic they died to save.

277
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,137
''l pray that Our Heavenly Father

278
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:24,140
''may assuage the anguish of your bereavement

279
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:28,603
''and leave only the cherished memory of the loved lost...

280
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:31,356
''and the solemn pride that must be yours

281
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,775
''to have laid so costly a sacrifice

282
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:35,735
''upon the altar of freedom.

283
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:39,197
''Yours very sincerely and respectfully...

284
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,698
''Abraham Lincoln.''

285
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,971
That boy is alive.

286
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,932
We are gonna send somebody to find him...

287
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,728
and we are gonna get him the hell out of there.

288
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:11,813
Yes, sir.

289
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:27,620
We expected 32 tanks, 27 didn't make it.

290
00:36:27,704 --> 00:36:31,082
- Miller, Charlie Company. - Go in, Captain.

291
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:34,377
lf we don't off-load those Shermans by 0600,

292
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,088
we'll have an entire division stuck at Carentan

293
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,132
with its pants around its ankles.

294
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:41,176
Well, you let me know.

295
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:44,929
Have Charlie Company hold Vierville until we get there.

296
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,223
Yes, sir. Runner!

297
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:56,065
Airborne was supposed to win an open door for us.

298
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:58,985
They misdropped, scattered everything into the wind.

299
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,153
What's your situation?

300
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:02,739
Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

301
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,076
We took out towed 88s

302
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,913
here, here...and here.

303
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:11,664
They'd already gotten four Shermans

304
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:13,750
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

305
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,169
These two minefields are one big one.

306
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:17,670
We tried going through,

307
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:20,757
but it turned into a high-density field...

308
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,175
little bit of everything.

309
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:24,969
Spreng mine 44s, pot mines, A-200s...

310
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:29,182
the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.

311
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:33,144
This road here... they placed Teller mine 43s,

312
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:34,979
l guess for our tanks...

313
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:38,107
from here to the edge of the village.

314
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,818
So we marked 'em, called the engineers.

315
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:42,195
Resistance?

316
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:44,155
We had higher support expectations, sir.

317
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,783
There was an understrength company without artillery.

318
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:50,036
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry, von Luck Kampfgruppe.

319
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,163
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

320
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,415
We turned them over to MPs.

321
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:00,213
What about our casualties?

322
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:02,423
Well...

323
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:04,175
the figures...

324
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,761
were 35 dead...

325
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:08,137
times two wounded.

326
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:13,184
They just... didn't wanna give up those 88s.

327
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:16,145
lt was tough, that's why you got it.

328
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:17,772
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:20,149
John...

330
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:25,405
l've got another one for you.

331
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:28,575
- Yes, sir. - Straight from the top.

332
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:39,169
We're taking a squad to Neuville on a public relations mission.

333
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:41,212
You leading a squad?

334
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:46,176
Some Private lost three brothers and got a ticket home.

335
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:47,552
How come Neuville?

336
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:51,181
They think he's part of all those airborne misdrops.

337
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:55,059
lt won't be easy finding one particular soldier.

338
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:57,812
Like finding a needle in a stack of needles.

339
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,355
What about the company?

340
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:03,151
We take our pick, the rest get folded into Baker.

341
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:04,819
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:07,197
They took away your company?

343
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,409
lt wasn't my company. lt was the army's. So they told me.

344
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:15,163
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson, Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

345
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:16,956
Beasley's dead.

346
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,251
All right, Mellish, then. We got anybody speaks French?

347
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:22,795
Not that l know of.

348
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,130
What about Talbot?

349
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,549
- This morning. - Oh. All right.

350
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:29,177
l'll try to dig up another interpreter.

351
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,346
Assemble at battalion motor pool.

352
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,388
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:34,766
- What we doing? - Listen up... What?

354
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:36,142
What we gonna do?

355
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:39,979
You're going home with a hunk of cheese in your ass, Caparzo.

356
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:42,815
You like it in the ass.

357
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:44,776
Attention!

358
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,194
As you were.

359
00:39:46,277 --> 00:39:47,987
l'm looking for Corporal Upham,

360
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:50,240
- Timothy E. - l'm Upham, sir.

361
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:52,909
- You speak French and German? - Yes, sir.

362
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:53,952
Accent?

363
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:56,913
A slight one in French. My German's clean, sir.

364
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:59,582
You're reassigned to me. Grab your gear.

365
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,544
We're going to Neuville. When was this updated?

366
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:04,462
As of 0830, sir.

367
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:06,005
Uh, sir...

368
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:07,757
These two axes advance south...

369
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:09,759
Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.

370
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:15,348
- Yes, Corporal. - Sir, a LOT of Germans.

371
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:16,933
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

372
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:21,312
No, l've never been in combat. l make maps, translate...

373
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:24,315
l need someone who speaks French and German.

374
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,650
My guys were killed.

375
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,653
But l haven't held a weapon since training, sir.

376
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:32,073
- Did you fire the weapon? - Yes, sir.

377
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,659
- Then get your gear. - Yes, sir.

378
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,996
Sir, may l...

379
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,086
May l bring my typewriter, sir?

380
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,508
Yes, sir.

381
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,681
Thank you very much, sir.

382
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:59,267
- That a souvenir? - No, sir.

383
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,977
Take your time, Corporal.

384
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,066
Look on the bright side, Corporal.

385
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,318
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:12,322
For one thing... you don't need to carry those.

387
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:13,740
You'll need that.

388
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:16,659
Need this. Yes, sir. Don't need that...

389
00:42:15,718 --> 00:42:17,595
You want your head blown off?

390
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,640
Don't fuckin' touch me with those little rat claws.

391
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:22,976
Get the fuck back in formation.

392
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:26,855
l was wondering where you're from, that's...

393
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,653
Caparzo, is it?

394
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:35,238
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

395
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,447
Got you.

396
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:41,035
And saluting the captain makes him a target for Germans.

397
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,497
So don't do it, especially when l'm next to him.

398
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,251
Corporal, what's your book about?

399
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:50,879
- Watch your rifle. - Sorry.

400
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:53,590
lt's supposed to be about the bonds of brotherhood

401
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:55,633
that develop between soldiers during war.

402
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:57,719
Brotherhood?

403
00:42:57,802 --> 00:42:59,596
What do you know about brotherhood?

404
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,182
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

405
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:04,517
Ask the captain where he's from.

406
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,060
Yeah, ask the captain.

407
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:08,146
He'll tell you everything you wanna know.

408
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:11,024
You wanna explain the math of this to me?

409
00:43:11,107 --> 00:43:15,653
Why risk the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?

410
00:43:15,737 --> 00:43:18,406
20 degrees. Anybody wanna answer?

411
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:22,160
Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother.

412
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:24,037
l got a mother, all right?

413
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,623
l mean, you got a mother. Sarge has got a mother.

414
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:29,918
Shit, l bet even the captain's got a mother.

415
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:33,046
Well, not the captain, but the rest of us.

416
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:36,549
''Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die.''

417
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:42,222
What does that mean? We're all supposed to die?

418
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:45,225
Upham's talking about our duty as soldiers.

419
00:43:45,308 --> 00:43:46,601
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:46,684 --> 00:43:49,270
We have orders to follow. That supersedes everything,

421
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:50,730
including your mothers.

422
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:52,106
Thank you, sir.

423
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,609
Even if you think the mission's fubar, sir?

424
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:57,362
Especially if you think the mission's fubar.

425
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,947
What's ''fubar''?

426
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,741
Oh, it's German. Yeah.

427
00:44:01,824 --> 00:44:04,077
Never heard of that.

428
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,620
Sir...

429
00:44:05,703 --> 00:44:07,997
l have an opinion on this matter.

430
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:11,042
Well, by all means, share it with the squad.

431
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,253
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

432
00:44:13,336 --> 00:44:16,047
this entire mission is a serious misallocation

433
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,049
of valuable military resources.

434
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:19,843
Yeah. Go on.

435
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:22,011
Well, it seems to me, sir,

436
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:25,473
that God made me a fine instrument of warfare.

437
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:29,602
Reiben, pay attention. This is the way to gripe!

438
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:30,645
Continue, Jackson.

439
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:32,021
What l mean, sir,

440
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:37,151
if you put me and this rifle within one mile of Adolf Hitler

441
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:39,654
with a clear line of sight, sir...

442
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:43,116
Pack your bags, fellas. War's over. Amen.

443
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,659
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

444
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:48,037
So, Captain, what about you? You don't gripe at all?

445
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:51,040
l don't gripe to you, Reiben. l'm a captain.

446
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:54,294
There's a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down.

447
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:59,132
You gripe to me, l gripe to my superiors and so on.

448
00:44:59,215 --> 00:45:03,094
l don't gripe to you or in front of you.

449
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,054
l'm sorry, sir, but, uh...

450
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:09,642
Let's say you weren't a captain. What would you say then?

451
00:45:09,726 --> 00:45:11,060
Well, in that case,

452
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:14,022
l'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

453
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:16,024
with an extremely valuable objective, sir,

454
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:18,651
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

455
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:21,237
Moreover...l feel heartfelt sorrow

456
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:24,032
for the mother of Private James Ryan

457
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:28,411
and will lay down my life and the lives of my men,

458
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:31,581
especially you, Reiben, to ease her suffering.

459
00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:35,168
- He's good. - l love him.

460
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:46,638
Right.

461
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,223
Thunder!

462
00:46:30,306 --> 00:46:31,641
Flash!

463
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,017
Upham, over there.

464
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,103
Reiben, you four go.

465
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:46,364
Go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,413
You're a welcome sight.

467
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:54,998
Our relief showed up.

468
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:56,624
How many are you?

469
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:59,127
Just eight. We're not your relief. Sorry.

470
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,004
What do you mean, sir?

471
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:03,047
We're here for a Private Ryan.

472
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,841
Who? Ryan? What for?

473
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:07,343
- ls he here? - l don't know.

474
00:47:07,427 --> 00:47:13,391
Maybe on the other side of town. The Germans cut us in two.

475
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:17,228
- What's his name again? - Ryan. James Ryan.

476
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:18,646
He dropped in with 101st.

477
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,441
- Goldman, get me a runner. - Runner!

478
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:22,859
Come on.

479
00:47:27,113 --> 00:47:29,073
Jonesy, make a hole there!

480
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:34,037
We got stopped by intense rifle action from the eastward.

481
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,998
The Germans have been reinforcing regiments all day.

482
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:39,501
lt's been quiet for about 45 minutes.

483
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:43,004
Most of the German fire is concentrated to the westward.

484
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:44,631
Who's on the loudspeaker?

485
00:47:44,714 --> 00:47:46,049
That's Dagwood Düsseldorf,

486
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:48,801
our friendly neighbourhood morale officer.

487
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:51,012
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

488
00:47:51,095 --> 00:47:54,641
''The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.''

489
00:47:54,724 --> 00:47:56,267
That's disconcerting.

490
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:01,022
Take the second left...

491
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:05,026
Your father was circumcised by my rabbi, you prick!

492
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:08,029
Private Ryan, James, probably misdropped with 101 .

493
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:10,031
- Got that? - Cover!

494
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:18,873
Go!

495
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:44,315
Those sadistic fuckin' animals!

496
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,358
Get down.

497
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:48,611
They know we're not in contact, they'll get the runners.

498
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:50,196
Why keep shooting him?

499
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,032
Long as he lives, he carries the message.

500
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:55,618
- We'd do the same. - We wouldn't!

501
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:59,289
- Get ready to travel. - Yes, sir.

502
00:48:59,372 --> 00:49:02,667
Try again to let Captain Hamill know we're coming.

503
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,043
What's the rest of Neuville like?

504
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:08,006
Uh, next block's got two-storey buildings both sides.

505
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:11,384
A lotta windows and a square on the left.

506
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:13,928
- Show me. - Sarge, hold right here.

507
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:15,054
Yes, sir.

508
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,604
Let's stay out of this enfilade and use the buildings.

509
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,648
Try a left hook. Two of yours, two of mine.

510
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,775
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

511
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,445
Reiben, Caparzo.

512
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:32,363
Fundamentals. Short runs.

513
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:34,866
High and low at the corners.

514
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:37,243
Be prepared for close contact.

515
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:40,622
Go. Upham, stay with Sergeant Horvath.

516
00:49:40,705 --> 00:49:41,831
Stay right here.

517
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:43,625
l'll wear him like underwear!

518
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:44,792
Stay with me.

519
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:56,221
Past the end are the gates to the square.

520
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:57,305
Good.

521
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:06,814
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

522
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:09,651
Figure that out, you got yourself a prize.

523
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:11,069
300 bucks, l heard.

524
00:50:11,152 --> 00:50:14,781
Company's got a pool. Five bucks gets you in.

525
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:19,577
Easy.

526
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:24,958
lt's around this corner. Defilade up to those gates.

527
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,920
Somebody must know where he's from.

528
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:32,423
Been with him since Kasserine Pass, and l don't know.

529
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:34,050
My ankles are killing me.

530
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:37,011
l'll need a wheelchair before this is over.

531
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:39,639
Ow! That's it. Oh, my God.

532
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:41,641
Got ankles like an old woman.

533
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:43,017
Like an old...

534
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:47,438
Reiben.

535
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,649
So you don't even know where he went to school?

536
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:51,651
Captain didn't go to school,

537
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,571
they assembled him out of Gl body parts.

538
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:56,030
Pay attention to detail.

539
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:59,617
l know where he's from 'cause l pay attention to detail.

540
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:01,035
Hey, Upham...

541
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,746
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

542
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:10,003
Do it.

543
00:51:10,086 --> 00:51:11,045
Thunder!

544
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:13,631
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

545
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:26,019
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

546
00:51:38,948 --> 00:51:41,826
Ask where the Germans are.

547
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:47,624
What's he saying?

548
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:49,000
The children.

549
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,168
Take the children.

550
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:52,754
No, we can't take the kids.

551
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:56,841
We can't take the kids! No!

552
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:02,013
They think they'll be safe with us.

553
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:04,807
lt's not gonna be safe with us!

554
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:07,602
Are you nuts?! Listen to the Captain!

555
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:10,104
They think they'll be safe, sir.

556
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:12,065
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

557
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,026
Put that kid back!

558
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:20,448
Put that little girl back!

559
00:52:20,532 --> 00:52:22,617
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

560
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,453
Upham, how do you say ''lt's OK''?

561
00:52:25,537 --> 00:52:27,664
She reminds me of my niece, sir.

562
00:52:27,747 --> 00:52:29,624
Get the kid back up there!

563
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:33,545
Captain, we could take her down the road to the next town.

564
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,046
We're not here to do the decent thing!

565
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:36,756
We're here to follow fuckin' orders!

566
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,842
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

567
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:42,971
Cover! Cover!

568
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:51,688
Come on. No!

569
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:53,731
Goddamit! Where'd that come from?

570
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:58,486
He was on the ground before we heard.

571
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:05,869
That's where l'd be.

572
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:09,414
l didn't see it.

573
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:12,041
450 yards, Captain. Maybe a shade under.

574
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:14,043
l wouldn't venture out there, fellas!

575
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:16,504
This sniper's got talent!

576
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,637
Please don't cry. l'll take you back to your parents.

577
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,681
Please don't cry. Come on.

578
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,489
Captain.

579
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,867
Hold on, Caparzo.

580
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,035
Help me up.

581
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:48,786
l can walk. l can walk.

582
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,580
Caparzo, stay still!

583
00:53:58,505 --> 00:53:59,881
All right.

584
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:04,886
Two clicks, left wind.

585
00:54:17,148 --> 00:54:20,318
Captain, can you see him from there? How is he?

586
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:22,612
Wade, you stay put.

587
00:54:22,695 --> 00:54:24,113
Where's he shot, Captain?

588
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:29,077
- Can you see him? - Stay there!

589
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,621
Damn it, stay down!

590
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:33,039
What's up with you?

591
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:36,459
What if you get hit? Huh?

592
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,503
Fish, come over here.

593
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:40,421
Carpy, put your head down.

594
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:42,257
Put your head down.

595
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:53,810
O my God, l trust in Thee.

596
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:56,855
Let me not be ashamed.

597
00:54:56,938 --> 00:54:59,983
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

598
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:11,035
Copy it.

599
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,496
Copy it and send it for me.

600
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,999
You're gonna send it. Put it down!

601
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:18,418
- lt's got blood! - l see it.

602
00:55:23,173 --> 00:55:26,259
lt's... lt's to my dad.

603
00:55:26,342 --> 00:55:27,927
lt's got blood on it.

604
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,582
We got him.

605
00:55:57,665 --> 00:55:58,708
Stay down.

606
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:08,593
How bad is it?

607
00:56:08,676 --> 00:56:10,970
Chest, maybe lung shot.

608
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:29,113
Get that 30 up the street!

609
00:56:34,118 --> 00:56:35,620
Detail!

610
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,038
Clear up!

611
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,706
Clear down!

612
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:55,515
That's why we can't take children.

613
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:05,650
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

614
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:08,444
Upham... canteens.

615
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:09,779
Fill 'em up.

616
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:12,073
- Sergeant Hill. - Yes, sir.

617
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:16,536
Gather your men. We'll form up at the north-west corner.

618
00:57:18,788 --> 00:57:21,583
Mellish, check the tower.

619
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,084
Right now. Go!

620
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:36,306
Fuck Ryan.

621
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,652
- Thunder! - Flash!

622
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:51,070
Come on in.

623
00:57:56,117 --> 00:57:58,244
Hey, guys, we're looking for Captain Hamill.

624
00:57:58,328 --> 00:58:00,079
Somewhere across the square.

625
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:01,664
Across the square.

626
00:58:01,748 --> 00:58:04,042
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

627
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,127
Take it easy. Sit down.

628
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:25,688
Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill, bring him in here.

629
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,023
What? Up there?

630
00:58:27,106 --> 00:58:30,068
How should l know? Would you go look, please?

631
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:31,486
Thank you, you moron.

632
00:58:33,321 --> 00:58:35,073
All right.

633
00:58:35,156 --> 00:58:38,785
You guys just flake out here for a while.

634
00:58:40,328 --> 00:58:43,122
Let me get this goddamn hitchhiker out of my boot.

635
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:53,258
Jesus!

636
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,468
Drop your weapons!

637
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:56,678
Drop 'em now!

638
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:58,054
Drop the fucking weapons!

639
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:03,893
l'll shoot you! l'll shoot!

640
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:05,520
Drop! Drop! Drop 'em!

641
00:59:08,606 --> 00:59:10,400
Now! Put 'em down!

642
00:59:25,748 --> 00:59:27,083
Clear up!

643
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,256
Shit.

644
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:34,883
Shit!

645
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:36,301
Clear up!

646
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:39,095
Clear down!

647
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:53,193
Enough to make you old.

648
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,737
Let's hope so.

649
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:07,040
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.

650
01:00:07,123 --> 01:00:09,042
John Miller, 2nd Rangers.

651
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,169
Thank you.

652
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:13,505
We're looking for Private James Ryan.

653
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:17,383
He's part of your outfit. Any chance you policed him up?

654
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:20,678
- How was the road in? - Scenic.

655
01:00:20,762 --> 01:00:22,764
We lost most of our ammo.

656
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:25,016
And one of our men.

657
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,436
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka to the right side.

658
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,646
Yes, sir!

659
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,648
And get Ryan up here.

660
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:34,609
Ryan!

661
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:37,028
Ryan, front and centre!

662
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:38,780
Ryan!

663
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:43,618
Here comes our boy.

664
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:53,086
Told you he was an asshole.

665
01:00:55,421 --> 01:00:57,048
Sir, Private Ryan reporting.

666
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,633
At ease.

667
01:00:58,716 --> 01:01:02,220
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers. He wants a word with you.

668
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,057
This way.

669
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,642
All right.

670
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,102
Take a knee.

671
01:01:18,194 --> 01:01:20,864
Private, l have some bad news.

672
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:33,376
Well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh...

673
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:39,048
so l'll just say it - your brothers are dead.

674
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:44,888
We have, uh, orders to come get you...

675
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,472
'cause you're going home.

676
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:03,406
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

677
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:13,500
l was gonna take 'em fishing when we got home.

678
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:30,225
l'm so sorry, James.

679
01:02:30,308 --> 01:02:32,769
l can't tell you how much.

680
01:02:32,852 --> 01:02:35,647
How...how did they die?

681
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,608
They were killed in action.

682
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:42,820
No, that can't be. They're both...

683
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:45,031
That...that can't be.

684
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:49,077
My brothers are still in grammar school.

685
01:02:50,703 --> 01:02:52,747
You're James Ryan?

686
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,499
Yeah.

687
01:02:54,582 --> 01:02:57,794
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

688
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:00,672
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

689
01:03:06,344 --> 01:03:09,722
Well, does that...does that mean my brothers are OK?

690
01:03:09,806 --> 01:03:11,641
Yeah, l'm sure they're fine.

691
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:13,685
Are you sure they're OK, though?

692
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:16,729
We're looking for a different Private Ryan.

693
01:03:16,813 --> 01:03:18,606
How do you know?

694
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,859
How do you know the foul-up

695
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:23,486
isn't that his brothers are OK and that...

696
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,780
Lieutenant, l'm sorry for the trouble.

697
01:03:25,864 --> 01:03:30,702
l just wrote them a letter... l got to get home.

698
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:34,455
l got to get home right now.

699
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:36,166
Shh, take it easy.

700
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:38,585
- Where's our Ryan? - l don't know.

701
01:03:38,668 --> 01:03:40,336
You in touch with your CO?

702
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,131
- That figures. - What unit's he in?

703
01:03:43,214 --> 01:03:44,716
Baker Company, 506.

704
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,011
- The guy with the broken foot? - Charlie, l think.

705
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:49,304
You think? Yeah.

706
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:52,140
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

707
01:03:52,223 --> 01:03:54,392
Where was your drop zone?

708
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:55,852
Just inside of Vierville.

709
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:58,855
Vierville? How did you end up here?

710
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:00,064
You got me, sir.

711
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:02,025
C-47 took heavy fire.

712
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:05,111
Pilot tried to get out, turning every which way.

713
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:09,199
Took more fire in the drop. Got messy. l ended up here.

714
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:12,660
l haven't seen a single guy from my stick, sir.

715
01:04:12,744 --> 01:04:16,331
Anybody there have a big mouth, say where the drop was?

716
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:20,001
No, sir, but they had the same rally point as us.

717
01:04:20,084 --> 01:04:21,961
Show me.

718
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:23,588
My men are beat.

719
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:27,717
We'll hold up for three hours then pull out after dark.

720
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,721
Got anything left in this town like a three-star hotel?

721
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:34,641
Something with clean sheets and room service?

722
01:04:34,724 --> 01:04:36,643
How about a nice comfy church?

723
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:39,062
- We'll take that. - Any news?

724
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,647
How's it all falling together?

725
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,607
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

726
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,443
Problem is Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

727
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:48,071
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

728
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:49,155
That guy's overrated.

729
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:50,532
No argument here.

730
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:53,368
You got to take Caen so you can take Saint-Lo.

731
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:55,453
Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.

732
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:57,080
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

733
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:58,623
And Cherbourg, you got Paris.

734
01:04:58,706 --> 01:05:01,042
Paris, you get Berlin.

735
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,127
Then that big boat home.

736
01:05:05,255 --> 01:05:08,216
We sure could use you around here,

737
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:10,093
but l understand what you're doing.

738
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:11,344
You do?

739
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:14,681
Yeah. l got a couple of brothers myself.

740
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:17,100
- Oh. - Good luck.

741
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:18,309
Thank you.

742
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:20,061
No, l mean it.

743
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,689
Find him. Get him home.

744
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:33,158
What's with your hand?

745
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:35,535
l don't know.

746
01:05:37,162 --> 01:05:40,957
lt started when they brought us down for embarkation.

747
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,500
lt comes and goes.

748
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:45,795
You may have to get yourself a new job.

749
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:49,090
This one doesn't seem to agree with you any more.

750
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:55,471
What?

751
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:01,519
- What? - Nothing.

752
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:04,522
What was the name of that kid at Anzio?

753
01:06:04,606 --> 01:06:07,609
He was always walking around on his hands,

754
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:11,613
and singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze?

755
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,456
Yeah, Vecchio.

756
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:23,917
He was a goofy kid.

757
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,213
Remember he used to pee a ''V'' on everybody's jacket,

758
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:30,381
for Vecchio.

759
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:31,758
For victory.

760
01:06:31,841 --> 01:06:33,176
Vecchio.

761
01:06:36,012 --> 01:06:37,388
He was so short.

762
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:41,351
- Wasn't he a midget? - How did he become a Ranger?

763
01:06:43,978 --> 01:06:46,231
Got shot in the foot once.

764
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:48,733
He could walk faster on his hands.

765
01:06:50,735 --> 01:06:53,363
He could run faster on his hands than...

766
01:07:09,128 --> 01:07:15,677
You see, when...you end up killing one of your men,

767
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,847
you tell yourself it happened

768
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:26,062
so you could save the lives of two or three or 10 others.

769
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:28,106
Maybe a hundred others.

770
01:07:31,276 --> 01:07:35,363
Do you know how many men l've lost under my command?

771
01:07:35,446 --> 01:07:38,741
- How many? - 94.

772
01:07:38,825 --> 01:07:42,495
But that means l've saved the lives

773
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:44,831
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

774
01:07:44,914 --> 01:07:47,917
Maybe even 20, right?

775
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:49,377
20 times as many?

776
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,385
And that's how simple it is.

777
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:00,638
That's how you...

778
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:03,892
That's how you rationalise making the choice

779
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:07,145
between the mission and the men.

780
01:08:07,228 --> 01:08:10,190
Except this time, this mission is a man.

781
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:16,070
This Ryan better be worth it.

782
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:22,035
He'd better go home and cure some disease

783
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:26,039
or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.

784
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:31,002
l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

785
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:32,921
Amen.

786
01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:37,175
Look. There it goes again.

787
01:08:37,258 --> 01:08:38,593
Sir...

788
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:41,596
are you all right?

789
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,020
Look, we're gonna move out in two hours.

790
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:50,897
Why don't you get some sleep?

791
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,691
l don't know how he does it.

792
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:55,068
What's that?

793
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:57,779
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

794
01:08:57,862 --> 01:09:00,698
He's lights-out the minute his head's down.

795
01:09:00,782 --> 01:09:02,116
Clear conscience.

796
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,830
What's that saying? ''lf God's on our side, who's on theirs?''

797
01:09:06,913 --> 01:09:10,166
''lf God be for us, who could be against us?''

798
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,668
Yeah, what did l say?

799
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:13,169
Well, actually,

800
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:16,631
the trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

801
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,591
How is that, Wade?

802
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:23,346
My mother was an intern, she worked late nights,

803
01:09:23,429 --> 01:09:25,306
slept through the day,

804
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,602
so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.

805
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:34,274
So l used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake,

806
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:37,777
but it never worked 'cause the harder l tried,

807
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:39,904
the faster l'd fall asleep.

808
01:09:40,613 --> 01:09:43,158
That wouldn't have mattered in my house.

809
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:46,578
My ma would've shook me awake, chatted till dawn.

810
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:49,664
That woman was never too tired to talk.

811
01:09:49,747 --> 01:09:53,209
Probably the only time she could get a word in.

812
01:09:56,921 --> 01:10:01,885
Funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early,

813
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:04,387
and l'd pretend to be asleep.

814
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,223
Who? You...your mom?

815
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:08,474
Yeah.

816
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,479
She'd stand in the doorway looking at me.

817
01:10:14,564 --> 01:10:17,108
And l'd just keep my eyes shut.

818
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:23,448
l knew she just wanted to find out about my day,

819
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:25,325
that she came home early...

820
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,413
just to talk to me.

821
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:33,875
And l still wouldn't move.

822
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:36,503
l'd still pretend to just be asleep.

823
01:10:44,177 --> 01:10:47,764
l don't know why l did that.

824
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:03,738
We only got a couple hours. Go to sleep.

825
01:11:12,205 --> 01:11:15,667
Captain? Sir?

826
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,670
Corporal?

827
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:27,053
How you doin' there? You all right?

828
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:31,474
Yeah, l think this is all good for me, sir.

829
01:11:31,558 --> 01:11:33,935
Really?

830
01:11:34,018 --> 01:11:36,062
How is that?

831
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:41,860
''War educates the senses,

832
01:11:41,943 --> 01:11:43,945
''calls into action the will,

833
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:47,115
''perfects the physical constitution,

834
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:50,160
''brings men into such swift and close collision

835
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:53,538
''in critical moments that man measures man.''

836
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:56,332
Yeah, well, l guess that's Emerson's way

837
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,418
of finding the bright side.

838
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:02,797
- You know Emerson, sir? - l know some.

839
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:11,097
So where are you from, Captain? What'd you do before the war?

840
01:12:12,682 --> 01:12:14,726
What's the pool up to?

841
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:22,150
You know, l think it's around 300, sir.

842
01:12:22,233 --> 01:12:24,694
Well, when it gets up to 500,

843
01:12:24,777 --> 01:12:29,073
l'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?

844
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:33,119
Well, sir, l feel it's my duty under your command

845
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:37,248
to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.

846
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,794
What if we don't live that long?

847
01:12:44,172 --> 01:12:47,717
- 500? - 500 would be good, yeah.

848
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,760
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:50,220
Yeah.

850
01:12:52,347 --> 01:12:54,098
Get some sleep, Corporal.

851
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:55,225
Yes, sir.

852
01:14:01,457 --> 01:14:03,251
Who's got sulphur powder?

853
01:14:06,296 --> 01:14:08,673
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!

854
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:10,091
He needs a tourniquet!

855
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:12,177
- Wade. - Yes, sir?

856
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,679
- Do what you can. - Yes, sir.

857
01:14:14,762 --> 01:14:16,181
Hold on, fellas.

858
01:14:16,264 --> 01:14:17,765
lt won't be much longer.

859
01:14:17,849 --> 01:14:20,351
How we doing here?

860
01:14:20,435 --> 01:14:21,811
All right.

861
01:14:21,895 --> 01:14:24,272
Yeah, doing all right. Don't worry about it.

862
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:26,357
Doc's in town.

863
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:27,775
lt's all right. lt's all right.

864
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:31,779
The 29th lnfantry's breaking through, they'll be here soon.

865
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:34,199
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

866
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:38,244
- Captain. Hey, Captain. - Soldier, want to fill me in?

867
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:40,079
Uh, yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

868
01:14:40,163 --> 01:14:43,416
99th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying 327th Glider lnfantry.

869
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,253
This one was mine. l was the pilot. 22 dead.

870
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:51,466
l ended up without a scratch. Took my co-pilot's head off.

871
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,384
Well, who are these people?

872
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:57,764
The guys we came with, they headed off first night.

873
01:14:57,847 --> 01:15:01,893
Other guys keep showing up. One, two, half-dozen at a time.

874
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:04,938
Then some officer'll patch together a mixed unit,

875
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:07,315
head off to make trouble, sir.

876
01:15:07,398 --> 01:15:09,317
We're looking for Private James Ryan.

877
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,611
Baker Company, 506 of the 101st.

878
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:13,112
No, you got me, sir.

879
01:15:13,196 --> 01:15:14,447
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

880
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:16,616
Check that squad.

881
01:15:16,699 --> 01:15:20,537
- See if Ryan's in it. - Yes, sir.

882
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:26,084
Smell that leg right there. ls it south of cheese?

883
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:33,591
What?

884
01:15:39,138 --> 01:15:41,599
Keep moving. Keep moving!

885
01:15:43,768 --> 01:15:45,603
l'm Juden, you know?

886
01:15:45,687 --> 01:15:48,106
Ju-den.

887
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:51,192
Yeah, l couldn't pry him out of there,

888
01:15:51,276 --> 01:15:53,486
- l'd need a winch. - Yeah.

889
01:15:57,031 --> 01:15:58,032
Stars.

890
01:15:58,116 --> 01:16:01,244
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,

891
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:04,122
Deputy Commander, 101st.

892
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:06,624
Some fucking genius had the idea

893
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,626
of welding steel plates on

894
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,629
to keep the general safe from ground fire.

895
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:13,923
Unfortunately, they forgot to tell me

896
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:15,842
until we were getting airborne.

897
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:17,927
That's like flying a freight train.

898
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:19,137
OK?

899
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,555
Gross overload.

900
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:23,349
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

901
01:16:23,433 --> 01:16:26,436
l nearly broke both my arms keeping her level.

902
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:28,438
And when...and when we released,

903
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:32,525
l cut as hard as l could, tried to gain altitude

904
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:34,569
and still keep from stalling.

905
01:16:34,652 --> 01:16:36,613
Came down like a fucking meteor.

906
01:16:36,696 --> 01:16:39,532
Here's how we ended up.

907
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:41,659
And the others,

908
01:16:41,743 --> 01:16:44,287
they stopped easy enough OK, though, you know?

909
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,333
We were just...we were just too damn heavy, you know?

910
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,710
The grass was wet.

911
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:53,129
Downward slope and all.

912
01:16:53,213 --> 01:16:56,049
22 guys dead.

913
01:16:58,259 --> 01:17:00,094
All that for a general?

914
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:02,305
One man.

915
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:07,310
- Lot of that going around. - Fubar.

916
01:17:07,393 --> 01:17:08,728
Fubar.

917
01:17:08,811 --> 01:17:10,188
Fubar.

918
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,606
Fubar.

919
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:13,775
Y'all got that right.

920
01:17:14,984 --> 01:17:18,071
l looked in a German dictionary. There's no ''fubar'' in there.

921
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,239
- Upham. - Yes, sir?

922
01:17:19,322 --> 01:17:21,991
There's more paratroops. Find out if one's Ryan.

923
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:23,117
Yes, sir.

924
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:26,204
You might want to check these out, sir.

925
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:28,081
Dog tags.

926
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:31,751
More than l really want to count, sir.

927
01:17:31,835 --> 01:17:34,879
l've...l've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

928
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:37,090
Jackson...

929
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:38,675
start going through those.

930
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:39,759
Yes, sir.

931
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:43,179
l'll help.

932
01:17:44,722 --> 01:17:47,141
What do you think? He in there?

933
01:17:47,225 --> 01:17:49,435
lf he is, l'll find him.

934
01:17:49,519 --> 01:17:51,312
l bet he is.

935
01:17:51,396 --> 01:17:54,440
10 bucks says l nail him first.

936
01:17:54,524 --> 01:17:58,153
- Who we got...? - You don't stand a chance.

937
01:17:58,236 --> 01:18:01,739
- You think he's in here? - Just keep looking.

938
01:18:01,823 --> 01:18:04,033
All right. Gary lanico.

939
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:05,368
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

940
01:18:05,451 --> 01:18:07,704
All the Guineas are buying it, huh?

941
01:18:07,787 --> 01:18:10,123
Oh, come on, not the right name.

942
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:12,375
Wee Willie Winkie, that's your buddy.

943
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,669
We gotta find this prick.

944
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:21,176
Where is this sonofabitch?

945
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:24,387
Don't mix them up? Keep them in your pile.

946
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,389
How will l know who's here?

947
01:18:26,472 --> 01:18:29,267
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben, all right?

948
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:30,685
Everybody be friends.

949
01:18:30,768 --> 01:18:32,353
Cranky there, huh?

950
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:35,148
l got a winner.

951
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:36,608
What you talking about?

952
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:38,067
Ryan.

953
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:39,194
Ryan?

954
01:18:39,277 --> 01:18:41,112
Look at that, Mellish.

955
01:18:41,196 --> 01:18:44,866
You're a genius, you really are. R-l-E-N-N-E.

956
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:48,328
That's Rienne. That's French. You know what that means?

957
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,704
lt means nothing.

958
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:54,083
- Three of a kind. - All from New York.

959
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,668
Do you need a hand with that?

960
01:18:55,752 --> 01:18:57,170
l got a full house.

961
01:18:57,253 --> 01:18:59,172
Got you beat. Straight flush.

962
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:02,675
You were looking at my tags. You're cheating, you know?

963
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:03,843
Ryan.

964
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:05,553
Fuckin' unreal, this guy.

965
01:19:05,637 --> 01:19:07,055
Do you need a hand with that?

966
01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:08,431
Can you read that shit?

967
01:19:08,515 --> 01:19:10,850
Jesus, look at this poor bastard.

968
01:19:10,934 --> 01:19:12,602
They're not bulletproof, huh?

969
01:19:12,685 --> 01:19:14,103
Guess not. All right?

970
01:19:14,187 --> 01:19:15,605
What's between his ears?

971
01:19:15,688 --> 01:19:19,108
Sort of what you fellas got between your legs.

972
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:21,653
We got to give him that.

973
01:19:21,736 --> 01:19:23,571
Not bad, Jackson.

974
01:19:23,655 --> 01:19:28,117
What the hell are you doing? The whole Airborne's watching.

975
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:29,327
These aren't chips.

976
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,997
- All right, all right. - Put 'em back in!

977
01:19:56,938 --> 01:19:58,606
He's not here.

978
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:02,694
Put 'em back.

979
01:20:02,777 --> 01:20:05,613
Maybe we should split into groups, huh?

980
01:20:05,697 --> 01:20:08,324
Wander the woods, calling his name.

981
01:20:08,408 --> 01:20:10,994
He'll hear us sooner or later. Ryan!

982
01:20:11,077 --> 01:20:14,789
That might be a little hard to do, Captain.

983
01:20:14,873 --> 01:20:18,084
Maybe the locals... Hey, you know... uh, excusez-moi.

984
01:20:18,168 --> 01:20:20,128
Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?

985
01:20:20,211 --> 01:20:21,796
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

986
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,840
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan, 101st Airborne?

987
01:20:23,923 --> 01:20:26,050
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?

988
01:20:26,134 --> 01:20:27,969
Private James Ryan from lowa?

989
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:30,805
Anybody know a Ryan?

990
01:20:30,889 --> 01:20:31,931
James Ryan?!

991
01:20:32,015 --> 01:20:35,768
Hey, Joe, doesn't, uh, Michaelson

992
01:20:35,852 --> 01:20:38,897
pal around with a Ryan from ''C'' Company?

993
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,064
l think so.

994
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:42,275
Bring him up here, would you?

995
01:20:51,284 --> 01:20:52,619
You know Private Ryan?

996
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,162
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

997
01:20:54,245 --> 01:20:56,831
Speak up, sir! My hearing's not good!

998
01:20:56,915 --> 01:20:58,166
lt comes and goes!

999
01:20:58,249 --> 01:21:00,376
A grenade went off by me!

1000
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:04,088
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

1001
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:05,215
Who?

1002
01:21:05,298 --> 01:21:08,968
- Private Ryan? James Ryan? - Jimmy Ryan?

1003
01:21:09,052 --> 01:21:12,055
James. James Francis Ryan.

1004
01:21:12,138 --> 01:21:14,933
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

1005
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:18,019
Get me a pencil, something to write on.

1006
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:19,979
Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1007
01:21:22,315 --> 01:21:24,108
A small one, sir.

1008
01:21:24,818 --> 01:21:26,236
Write this down.

1009
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,071
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

1010
01:21:28,154 --> 01:21:30,448
lowa, question mark.

1011
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:32,659
Do you know know him?

1012
01:21:32,742 --> 01:21:33,952
Read the message. Look.

1013
01:21:36,621 --> 01:21:38,748
Yeah. Of course l know him, sir.

1014
01:21:38,832 --> 01:21:40,375
Where is he?

1015
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,921
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:21:45,004 --> 01:21:48,049
We missed our drop zone by 20 miles,

1017
01:21:48,132 --> 01:21:51,052
ended up by Bumville or some damn place.

1018
01:21:51,135 --> 01:21:54,305
We were coming here to the rally point,

1019
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:57,642
ran into a colonel who was gathering up men

1020
01:21:57,725 --> 01:22:01,020
- to go to, uh...Ramelle... - Ramelle.

1021
01:22:01,104 --> 01:22:03,898
Babysitting a bridge. That's all l know, sir.

1022
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:05,650
Great! Great! Thank...thank you.

1023
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:07,819
Write ''thank you.'' Read, and thank you.

1024
01:22:07,902 --> 01:22:09,154
You're welcome!

1025
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:10,405
Assemble on me.

1026
01:22:12,615 --> 01:22:14,200
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1027
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:19,539
Ramelle.

1028
01:22:19,622 --> 01:22:22,917
We're here. There.

1029
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,085
Ramelle...

1030
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:28,131
is on the Merderet river, just south-west of us.

1031
01:22:28,214 --> 01:22:31,926
You know anything about this bridge, Captain?

1032
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:35,388
Yep. The target has always been Cherbourg.

1033
01:22:35,471 --> 01:22:39,184
We can't push on Paris without a deep water port,

1034
01:22:39,267 --> 01:22:40,852
Rommel knows that,

1035
01:22:40,935 --> 01:22:45,398
so he's gonna try to get his armour across the river.

1036
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:50,445
Then he can hit us in the flank when we turn to Cherbourg.

1037
01:22:50,528 --> 01:22:55,658
That makes any village with a bridge solid-gold real estate.

1038
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,972
Let's go.

1039
01:23:26,773 --> 01:23:28,566
Captain.

1040
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:08,481
What the hell is that?

1041
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:13,444
A radar site. Must be out of action.

1042
01:24:13,528 --> 01:24:15,655
Looks like there's something in that...

1043
01:24:15,738 --> 01:24:18,199
sandbag bunker right under the station.

1044
01:24:19,242 --> 01:24:20,243
See it?

1045
01:24:20,326 --> 01:24:22,203
Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1046
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:26,249
What is it?

1047
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:28,626
Machine gun. Probably MG-42.

1048
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,004
Jesus. ls that what got those guys?

1049
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:33,590
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1050
01:24:33,673 --> 01:24:36,092
No, their patches are 82nd.

1051
01:24:36,176 --> 01:24:39,053
l don't know how fast you guys are,

1052
01:24:39,137 --> 01:24:42,932
but let's detour this way, they'll never know we were here.

1053
01:24:44,058 --> 01:24:48,062
So, Captain, let's just go around it.

1054
01:24:48,146 --> 01:24:51,858
l hear what you're saying, but we can't.

1055
01:24:51,941 --> 01:24:55,069
l'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

1056
01:24:55,153 --> 01:24:58,865
- We left them 88s. - For the Air Force.

1057
01:24:58,948 --> 01:25:02,952
The Air Force won't spend ordinance on one machine gun.

1058
01:25:03,036 --> 01:25:05,163
Uh, Captain...

1059
01:25:05,246 --> 01:25:08,249
We skip it and still accomplish our mission.

1060
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,919
l mean, this isn't our mission, right?

1061
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:14,547
That's what you want to do, just leave it here?

1062
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:16,674
Let them ambush the next company?

1063
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:21,221
No, sir, l'm simply saying, it seems like an unnecessary risk

1064
01:25:21,304 --> 01:25:22,555
given our objective, sir.

1065
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,933
Our objective is to win the war.

1066
01:25:27,894 --> 01:25:32,398
Sir, l just, uh, l don't have a good feeling about this one.

1067
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:37,570
When was the last time you felt good about anything?

1068
01:25:59,217 --> 01:26:02,262
All right, three runners with suppressing fire.

1069
01:26:02,345 --> 01:26:04,305
Mellish, you hook to the right.

1070
01:26:04,389 --> 01:26:06,182
l'll go up the middle.

1071
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:08,059
Who's going left?

1072
01:26:14,232 --> 01:26:15,942
Who's going left?

1073
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:22,240
l'll do it.

1074
01:26:22,323 --> 01:26:23,575
l'll go left.

1075
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:25,285
All right.

1076
01:26:25,368 --> 01:26:28,955
Upham, switch off with Jackson, and you linger in the rear.

1077
01:26:29,038 --> 01:26:30,582
Yes, sir.

1078
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:34,460
We keep pressure on till he has to change his barrels.

1079
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:38,256
l think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.

1080
01:26:38,339 --> 01:26:42,343
- l should take the middle, sir. - The way you run?

1081
01:26:42,427 --> 01:26:46,806
- Maybe l should go left, sir. - Maybe you should shut up.

1082
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,851
Reiben, base of fire.

1083
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:00,987
Mags and clips where you can reach 'em, and...

1084
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:03,740
and extra grenades for the base runners.

1085
01:28:28,283 --> 01:28:30,577
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

1086
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,997
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!

1087
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,040
We need water and extra dressing now!

1088
01:28:36,124 --> 01:28:38,126
Get the morphine out of the extra medical kit!

1089
01:28:38,209 --> 01:28:41,171
Get the morphine out of the extra medical kit!

1090
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,433
Son of a bitch!

1091
01:28:53,516 --> 01:28:55,393
Get some sulphur on there.

1092
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:56,644
Move my legs up.

1093
01:28:56,728 --> 01:28:58,521
More sulphur, Mellish.

1094
01:28:58,605 --> 01:29:00,899
You're gonna be all right, doc.

1095
01:29:00,982 --> 01:29:02,400
How's it look?

1096
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:04,652
Wade, you're going on a hospital ship.

1097
01:29:04,736 --> 01:29:06,112
More sulphur!

1098
01:29:06,196 --> 01:29:08,823
Put my legs up. Put my legs up.

1099
01:29:08,907 --> 01:29:11,659
l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.

1100
01:29:11,743 --> 01:29:13,578
Upham, give me your canteen!

1101
01:29:13,661 --> 01:29:17,415
Come on. Come on. come on.

1102
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:18,708
Put some pressure on it.

1103
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:21,461
- You'll be OK. - How's it look?

1104
01:29:21,544 --> 01:29:24,380
- Give him morphine. - How's it look?

1105
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:27,091
- All right. - How's it look?

1106
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:28,635
Here comes the morphine.

1107
01:29:28,718 --> 01:29:32,347
Am l shot in the spine?

1108
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,098
- You're OK, Wade.

1109
01:29:34,182 --> 01:29:35,642
Am l shot in the spine?

1110
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:37,560
Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.

1111
01:29:37,644 --> 01:29:39,103
Put some pressure on him.

1112
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:40,522
Easy, easy.

1113
01:29:40,605 --> 01:29:41,940
Lift him up.

1114
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,195
lt's OK, doc. lt's all right.

1115
01:29:47,278 --> 01:29:49,781
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1116
01:29:49,864 --> 01:29:51,533
lt's in the small of your back.

1117
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,202
How big...how big's the hole in the...

1118
01:29:54,285 --> 01:29:56,079
lt's about the size of an acorn.

1119
01:29:56,162 --> 01:29:57,330
You're fine.

1120
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:02,252
Put some pressure on it.

1121
01:30:02,335 --> 01:30:05,713
Put some pressure on it. Put some pressure on it.

1122
01:30:05,797 --> 01:30:06,923
lt's all right.

1123
01:30:07,006 --> 01:30:09,884
Put some more pressure on it!

1124
01:30:09,968 --> 01:30:13,012
ls there anything bleeding worse than the others?

1125
01:30:13,096 --> 01:30:14,973
Yeah, right here. Do you know what it is?

1126
01:30:15,056 --> 01:30:16,266
No.

1127
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:18,726
Here. l'll put your hand on it.

1128
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:20,728
Pressure on there.

1129
01:30:20,812 --> 01:30:22,772
Right there. OK? That's the one.

1130
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:27,026
Oh, my God, my liver! Oh, my God! lt's my liver!

1131
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,488
Tell us what to do. Tell us how to fix you.

1132
01:30:30,572 --> 01:30:33,324
What can we do? Tell us what to do.

1133
01:30:33,408 --> 01:30:35,118
Oh, shit.

1134
01:30:35,201 --> 01:30:39,622
l could use...l could use a little more morphine.

1135
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,959
More morphine, sir?

1136
01:30:49,299 --> 01:30:50,967
Give it to him.

1137
01:30:52,927 --> 01:30:54,304
Give it to him.

1138
01:30:59,017 --> 01:31:00,059
l don't wanna die.

1139
01:31:00,143 --> 01:31:03,646
Here you go, Wade. Here you go.

1140
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:05,273
There you go. There you...

1141
01:31:08,193 --> 01:31:10,528
Give him another one.

1142
01:31:17,702 --> 01:31:19,204
Mama?

1143
01:31:21,456 --> 01:31:23,666
Mama?

1144
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:27,504
l want to go home. l want to go home.

1145
01:31:27,587 --> 01:31:31,174
Mama! Mama! Mam...

1146
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,346
Reiben, hold him!

1147
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:40,702
Not yet.

1148
01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:46,499
First, make him mark and cover Wade's body for grave detail.

1149
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:51,504
Same thing for those paratroopers down there.

1150
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:53,673
Strip that stuff. Check for intelligence.

1151
01:32:53,756 --> 01:32:56,926
Ask if he's the one who shot Wade.

1152
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:59,888
- lt doesn't matter. - lt does matter!

1153
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:06,269
Shut up with that filthy Pig Latin.

1154
01:33:08,062 --> 01:33:09,355
Jackson, you're hit.

1155
01:33:12,317 --> 01:33:14,068
Shut up.

1156
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:17,280
- lt just skinned me, sir. - Get it dressed.

1157
01:33:17,363 --> 01:33:19,991
You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

1158
01:33:23,036 --> 01:33:24,829
He says please don't shoot.

1159
01:33:24,913 --> 01:33:26,915
l don't care, Upham.

1160
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:31,503
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

1161
01:33:31,586 --> 01:33:36,758
- This is not right, sir. - Help him with the bodies.

1162
01:33:39,093 --> 01:33:41,179
What is happening?

1163
01:35:31,414 --> 01:35:33,458
American.

1164
01:35:34,501 --> 01:35:36,878
l like American.

1165
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:46,346
Steamboat Willie.

1166
01:35:46,429 --> 01:35:48,223
Steamboat Willie.

1167
01:35:48,306 --> 01:35:51,100
Yeah, Steamboat Willie. American.

1168
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:03,446
He's says he's not finished.

1169
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,989
That's what you think.

1170
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,460
Please...

1171
01:36:17,544 --> 01:36:20,964
l like America.

1172
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:23,341
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1173
01:36:23,424 --> 01:36:27,011
Go fly a kite! Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

1174
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:33,685
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1175
01:36:33,768 --> 01:36:35,937
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1176
01:36:43,153 --> 01:36:45,530
l say can you see...

1177
01:36:45,905 --> 01:36:49,284
l say can you see...

1178
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:51,202
l...l say...

1179
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:59,794
Fuck Hitler.

1180
01:37:01,838 --> 01:37:03,882
Fuck Hitler.

1181
01:37:10,471 --> 01:37:13,892
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1182
01:37:13,975 --> 01:37:16,769
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1183
01:37:16,853 --> 01:37:18,855
Captain!

1184
01:37:18,938 --> 01:37:21,107
Captain, this isn't right!

1185
01:37:21,191 --> 01:37:23,443
You know this. He's a prisoner.

1186
01:37:23,526 --> 01:37:25,069
He surrendered.

1187
01:37:25,153 --> 01:37:27,197
He surrendered, sir!

1188
01:37:37,707 --> 01:37:39,626
Tell him...

1189
01:37:42,045 --> 01:37:46,090
To march a thousand paces, then he can take off the blindfold.

1190
01:37:46,174 --> 01:37:49,969
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in to Allied patrols.

1191
01:37:50,053 --> 01:37:53,264
- We're letting him go? - He's a POW, Reiben.

1192
01:37:53,348 --> 01:37:55,141
Can't take him with us.

1193
01:37:55,225 --> 01:37:57,602
Our guys'll pick him up.

1194
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:10,949
lf he isn't picked up by the Wehrmacht,

1195
01:38:11,032 --> 01:38:12,992
then thrown back into circulation.

1196
01:38:15,328 --> 01:38:17,705
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1197
01:38:17,789 --> 01:38:19,457
This is such bullshit.

1198
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,875
Y'all got that right.

1199
01:38:20,959 --> 01:38:23,545
Bullshit? This is bullshit?

1200
01:38:23,628 --> 01:38:26,798
Shooting prisoners is OK? lt's against the goddamn rules!

1201
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:29,884
The rules just walked off with your friend.

1202
01:38:31,344 --> 01:38:34,764
But l guess that was the decent thing to do,

1203
01:38:34,848 --> 01:38:35,849
huh, Captain?

1204
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:45,984
Get your gear. Let's go.

1205
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:50,572
You heard him. Gear up.

1206
01:38:50,655 --> 01:38:52,782
The Captain just gave you an order.

1207
01:38:52,866 --> 01:38:56,161
Yeah. Like the one to take this machine gun.

1208
01:38:56,244 --> 01:38:58,538
That was a real doozie, sarge.

1209
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:00,123
Soldier, you're outta line.

1210
01:39:00,206 --> 01:39:03,710
Yes, sir, one hell of a call, to take this nest.

1211
01:39:03,793 --> 01:39:07,130
But, what the hell, we only lost one guy.

1212
01:39:07,213 --> 01:39:10,800
l hope mama Ryan's happy knowing that little Jimmy's life

1213
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:12,969
is more important than our guys!

1214
01:39:13,052 --> 01:39:16,097
But then, we haven't found him yet, have we?

1215
01:39:17,557 --> 01:39:19,225
Get the hell off me!

1216
01:39:19,309 --> 01:39:20,685
Reiben, get up.

1217
01:39:23,062 --> 01:39:25,773
Gear up. Fall in.

1218
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:33,198
l'm done with this mission.

1219
01:39:41,456 --> 01:39:42,457
Sir.

1220
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:46,503
Don't walk away from your Captain, get back in line.

1221
01:39:46,586 --> 01:39:49,380
l'll go to the stockade if l have to.

1222
01:39:49,464 --> 01:39:51,799
- l won't ask again. - Captain!

1223
01:39:51,883 --> 01:39:53,176
This is bullshit!

1224
01:39:53,259 --> 01:39:54,260
Fall in!

1225
01:39:54,344 --> 01:39:57,847
- You'd shoot me over Ryan? - No, l don't like you.

1226
01:39:57,931 --> 01:39:59,849
Just let him go!

1227
01:39:59,933 --> 01:40:01,768
Are you letting this happen?

1228
01:40:01,851 --> 01:40:03,686
Captain! You see this?

1229
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:07,565
- Captain? Sir? Ryan's dead. - Bullshit!

1230
01:40:07,649 --> 01:40:12,028
- Sir, we have a situation. - l have a sixth sense, l know.

1231
01:40:12,111 --> 01:40:15,198
You don't kill Krauts, but you shoot me, huh?

1232
01:40:15,281 --> 01:40:19,661
- He's better than you. - Do it. Put one in my leg...

1233
01:40:19,744 --> 01:40:21,996
l'm gonna shoot you in your big goddamn mouth!

1234
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,873
Put your money where your...

1235
01:40:23,957 --> 01:40:26,709
You don't know when to shut up.

1236
01:40:26,793 --> 01:40:27,836
Captain, please!

1237
01:40:27,919 --> 01:40:30,296
What's the pool on me up to?

1238
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:31,506
What?

1239
01:40:31,589 --> 01:40:34,801
- You coward son of a bitch! - l'm waiting, sarge.

1240
01:40:34,884 --> 01:40:38,304
Mike, what's the pool on me up to now?

1241
01:40:38,388 --> 01:40:40,807
What...what's it up to?

1242
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:43,393
What is it, $300? ls that it, 300?

1243
01:40:43,476 --> 01:40:45,520
l'm a schoolteacher.

1244
01:40:49,482 --> 01:40:52,485
l teach English composition

1245
01:40:52,569 --> 01:40:55,113
in this little town called Addley, Pennsylvania.

1246
01:40:55,196 --> 01:40:57,907
The last 1 1 years,

1247
01:40:57,991 --> 01:41:00,493
l've been at Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1248
01:41:02,871 --> 01:41:05,874
l was the coach of the baseball team.

1249
01:41:08,668 --> 01:41:11,254
l'll be doggone.

1250
01:41:11,337 --> 01:41:14,924
Back home, when l'd tell people what l do for a living,

1251
01:41:15,008 --> 01:41:18,803
they'd think, ''Well, that figures.''

1252
01:41:18,887 --> 01:41:22,724
But over here, it's a...

1253
01:41:22,807 --> 01:41:26,311
a big...

1254
01:41:26,394 --> 01:41:28,104
a big mystery.

1255
01:41:28,188 --> 01:41:33,318
So l guess l've changed some.

1256
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:37,113
Sometimes l wonder if l've changed so much,

1257
01:41:37,197 --> 01:41:41,826
my wife will even recognise me whenever l get back to her.

1258
01:41:43,286 --> 01:41:48,541
And how l'll ever be able to...

1259
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:51,294
to tell her about days like today.

1260
01:41:53,922 --> 01:41:57,383
Ah, Ryan...

1261
01:41:57,467 --> 01:42:00,845
l don't know anything about Ryan. l don't care.

1262
01:42:00,929 --> 01:42:06,726
The man means nothing to me, just a name. But if...

1263
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:10,021
lf finding him so he can go home,

1264
01:42:10,104 --> 01:42:12,690
lets me get back to my wife,

1265
01:42:12,774 --> 01:42:16,945
well, then... then that's my mission.

1266
01:42:18,613 --> 01:42:20,490
You want to leave?

1267
01:42:20,573 --> 01:42:24,494
You want to go off and fight the war?

1268
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:28,748
All right.

1269
01:42:28,832 --> 01:42:31,835
All right, l won't stop you.

1270
01:42:31,918 --> 01:42:34,170
l'll even put in the paperwork.

1271
01:42:35,713 --> 01:42:40,718
l just know, every man l kill, the farther from home l feel.

1272
01:44:05,887 --> 01:44:09,098
By memories

1273
01:44:09,182 --> 01:44:12,977
Of days gone by

1274
01:44:13,061 --> 01:44:15,688
ln my solitude

1275
01:44:15,772 --> 01:44:18,024
You taunt me

1276
01:44:18,107 --> 01:44:19,317
With memories

1277
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,779
That never die

1278
01:44:22,862 --> 01:44:25,532
l sit in my chair

1279
01:44:25,615 --> 01:44:27,826
Filled with despair

1280
01:44:27,909 --> 01:44:29,744
There's no one

1281
01:44:29,828 --> 01:44:33,248
Could be so sad

1282
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:35,166
With gloom everywhere

1283
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:37,460
l sit and l stare...

1284
01:44:51,224 --> 01:44:53,017
Half-track! Cover!

1285
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:13,204
Who's doing the shooting? Who's doing the shooting?

1286
01:45:33,057 --> 01:45:34,934
Move on their left flank!

1287
01:45:35,018 --> 01:45:36,269
Take their left flank!

1288
01:45:36,352 --> 01:45:39,022
Hold on, make sure they're down!

1289
01:46:00,084 --> 01:46:03,254
101st! We're coming out!

1290
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:12,847
That was a recon element, second SS.

1291
01:46:12,931 --> 01:46:17,143
We've been expecting a probe. That must have been it.

1292
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:23,316
Captain Miller, Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1293
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:25,401
Corporal Henderson, Easy Company, Five-o-first.

1294
01:46:25,485 --> 01:46:27,153
Ryan, First of the Five-o-sixth.

1295
01:46:27,237 --> 01:46:29,531
PFC Toynbe, Third of the Five-o-sixth.

1296
01:46:29,614 --> 01:46:31,699
James Francis Ryan?

1297
01:46:31,783 --> 01:46:34,536
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1298
01:46:46,047 --> 01:46:49,300
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1299
01:46:49,384 --> 01:46:52,971
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1300
01:46:55,056 --> 01:46:58,351
They beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1301
01:47:04,357 --> 01:47:08,820
Sir, if you're our relief, l'm gonna file a complaint.

1302
01:47:08,903 --> 01:47:10,738
l wouldn't blame you.

1303
01:47:10,822 --> 01:47:13,825
Who's your CO?

1304
01:47:13,908 --> 01:47:16,786
lt would have been Captain Jennings, sir.

1305
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:20,165
The best we can muster now is a corporal.

1306
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:23,835
So, what are you guys all about?

1307
01:47:24,878 --> 01:47:28,464
We're here for him. Ryan.

1308
01:47:28,548 --> 01:47:30,091
Me, sir?

1309
01:47:39,559 --> 01:47:43,146
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1310
01:47:43,229 --> 01:47:45,857
Yes, sir. Payton, lowa, that's correct.

1311
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:48,526
What is this about?

1312
01:47:50,403 --> 01:47:53,281
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1313
01:47:59,954 --> 01:48:02,207
Which...which ones?

1314
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:06,127
All of them.

1315
01:48:12,342 --> 01:48:17,680
Uh...On...on the level?

1316
01:48:18,807 --> 01:48:20,725
Yeah. l'm afraid so.

1317
01:48:20,809 --> 01:48:25,271
Uh...You might want to take some time with this.

1318
01:48:25,355 --> 01:48:28,358
lf there's someplace you want to go and...

1319
01:48:37,534 --> 01:48:41,079
- What's this all about? - Ryan lost his brothers.

1320
01:48:41,162 --> 01:48:43,832
- Which one? - All of them.

1321
01:48:48,211 --> 01:48:49,629
You...

1322
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:54,968
You came all the way out here to tell me that?

1323
01:48:56,928 --> 01:48:58,972
Well, you're... you're going home.

1324
01:49:00,682 --> 01:49:03,393
Our orders are to bring you back.

1325
01:49:06,563 --> 01:49:08,273
Bring me back?

1326
01:49:10,358 --> 01:49:14,612
Corporal Henderson...l don't mean to leave you short-handed,

1327
01:49:14,696 --> 01:49:16,948
but orders are orders.

1328
01:49:17,031 --> 01:49:18,741
When are you being relieved?

1329
01:49:18,825 --> 01:49:21,369
Sir, we have no way to tell.

1330
01:49:21,452 --> 01:49:24,789
My orders don't include me abandoning my post.

1331
01:49:24,873 --> 01:49:27,834
l understand that, but this changes things.

1332
01:49:27,917 --> 01:49:30,253
l don't see that it does, sir.

1333
01:49:31,796 --> 01:49:35,717
The Chief of Staff for the United States Army says it does.

1334
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,052
Sir, we have to hold this bridge.

1335
01:49:38,136 --> 01:49:41,931
The 82nd have taken out every bridge across the Merderet

1336
01:49:42,015 --> 01:49:44,309
except two, at Valognes and here.

1337
01:49:44,392 --> 01:49:47,770
lf the Germans take 'em, we'll have to displace.

1338
01:49:47,854 --> 01:49:52,192
Private, your outfit stays, but your party's over here.

1339
01:49:52,275 --> 01:49:54,527
Sir, l can't leave until reinforcements...

1340
01:49:54,611 --> 01:49:56,905
You got three minutes.

1341
01:49:56,988 --> 01:49:58,948
Sir, what about them? There's barely...

1342
01:49:59,032 --> 01:50:00,909
Hey, asshole!

1343
01:50:00,992 --> 01:50:05,538
Two of our guys already died trying to find you, all right?

1344
01:50:09,876 --> 01:50:11,794
Sir?

1345
01:50:11,878 --> 01:50:13,171
That's right.

1346
01:50:22,555 --> 01:50:24,516
What were their names?

1347
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:27,310
lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1348
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:31,022
Wade and...

1349
01:50:32,524 --> 01:50:34,067
Caparzo.

1350
01:50:46,579 --> 01:50:49,165
lt doesn't make any sense.

1351
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:54,712
lt doesn't make sense, sir. Why do l deserve to go?

1352
01:50:54,796 --> 01:50:58,091
Why not these guys? They fought just as hard!

1353
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,932
ls that what they're supposed to tell your mother

1354
01:51:06,015 --> 01:51:09,435
when they send her another folded American flag?

1355
01:51:16,151 --> 01:51:18,820
Tell her that when you found me,

1356
01:51:18,903 --> 01:51:22,574
l was here with the only brothers l have left,

1357
01:51:22,657 --> 01:51:26,828
and that there's no way l was gonna desert them.

1358
01:51:26,911 --> 01:51:29,581
l think she'll understand that.

1359
01:51:29,664 --> 01:51:31,833
There's no way l'm leaving this bridge.

1360
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:16,753
What are your orders?

1361
01:52:18,796 --> 01:52:22,884
Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here.

1362
01:52:22,967 --> 01:52:26,304
The world has taken a turn for the surreal.

1363
01:52:26,387 --> 01:52:28,973
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1364
01:52:29,057 --> 01:52:33,102
l don't know. What do you think?

1365
01:52:33,186 --> 01:52:36,272
You don't want to know what l think.

1366
01:52:38,274 --> 01:52:40,318
No, Mike, l do.

1367
01:52:42,153 --> 01:52:45,448
Well... part of me thinks the kid's right.

1368
01:52:45,532 --> 01:52:47,784
What's he done to deserve this?

1369
01:52:47,867 --> 01:52:52,247
lf he wants to stay here, fine, let's leave him.

1370
01:52:53,373 --> 01:52:54,749
Yeah.

1371
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:57,085
But another part of me thinks...

1372
01:52:57,168 --> 01:53:00,338
what if by some miracle we stay

1373
01:53:00,421 --> 01:53:03,383
and actually make it out of here?

1374
01:53:03,466 --> 01:53:05,802
Someday we might look back and decide

1375
01:53:05,885 --> 01:53:10,348
that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing

1376
01:53:10,431 --> 01:53:17,188
we were able to pull out of this whole God-awful, shitty mess.

1377
01:53:17,272 --> 01:53:21,442
That's what l was thinking, sir.

1378
01:53:21,526 --> 01:53:24,195
Like you said, Captain,

1379
01:53:25,405 --> 01:53:29,784
if we do that...we all earn the right to go home.

1380
01:53:33,454 --> 01:53:35,290
Oh, brother.

1381
01:53:37,917 --> 01:53:41,337
This is everything.

1382
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:43,673
Two .30-calibre machine guns,

1383
01:53:43,756 --> 01:53:45,383
1 7 grenades,

1384
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:47,802
1 1 Hawkins mines.

1385
01:53:47,886 --> 01:53:51,222
You got two bazookas, but only eight rounds left,

1386
01:53:51,306 --> 01:53:53,183
and assorted small arms.

1387
01:53:53,266 --> 01:53:56,102
An arty round took out our .60 mortar.

1388
01:53:56,186 --> 01:53:59,731
Might as well be spit wads if they use tanks.

1389
01:53:59,814 --> 01:54:03,318
- Which they're sure to. - What you thinking, sir?

1390
01:54:03,401 --> 01:54:04,569
Well...

1391
01:54:04,652 --> 01:54:08,698
l think they're going to try to whip around the flanks...

1392
01:54:12,327 --> 01:54:15,914
Unless we draw them up here between these buildings,

1393
01:54:15,997 --> 01:54:19,501
where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.

1394
01:54:19,584 --> 01:54:21,794
- Disable him? - lf we can.

1395
01:54:21,878 --> 01:54:25,381
Make the tank a 60-ton roadblock, we'll have a chance.

1396
01:54:25,465 --> 01:54:28,092
Yes, sir, don't let them mass anywhere.

1397
01:54:28,176 --> 01:54:31,054
Hit hard and fall back to the bridge.

1398
01:54:31,137 --> 01:54:35,600
Machine gun moving, number two up high to piss on their heads.

1399
01:54:35,683 --> 01:54:38,186
That would be the idea.

1400
01:54:38,269 --> 01:54:40,438
Jackson?

1401
01:54:40,522 --> 01:54:42,690
lf we can, l'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1402
01:54:42,774 --> 01:54:45,985
- Yes, sir. - Give you company if need be.

1403
01:54:46,069 --> 01:54:47,987
Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt.

1404
01:54:48,071 --> 01:54:52,283
l'd say a .30 with about 1 ,000 rounds would be OK.

1405
01:54:52,367 --> 01:54:54,160
Parker, job opportunity.

1406
01:54:54,244 --> 01:54:56,371
Not the worst idea, Captain.

1407
01:54:56,454 --> 01:55:00,250
But it all depends on knocking out the tank here, right?

1408
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:03,253
So how do you plan on doing that?

1409
01:55:03,336 --> 01:55:04,838
Reiben's right.

1410
01:55:04,921 --> 01:55:07,924
As our esteemed colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1411
01:55:08,007 --> 01:55:13,096
what we got here is spit wads, so how do we stop the tank?

1412
01:55:13,179 --> 01:55:14,889
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1413
01:55:14,973 --> 01:55:18,560
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1414
01:55:18,643 --> 01:55:20,520
Yeah, but with what?

1415
01:55:22,897 --> 01:55:25,191
We could try a sticky bomb.

1416
01:55:25,275 --> 01:55:26,818
Sticky bomb, sir?

1417
01:55:27,944 --> 01:55:32,949
- Sir, are you making that up? - No. lt's in the field manual.

1418
01:55:33,032 --> 01:55:35,785
Well, we're out of field manuals, sir.

1419
01:55:35,869 --> 01:55:37,912
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1420
01:55:37,996 --> 01:55:41,499
Right, you have demolition - some TNT or composition B?

1421
01:55:41,583 --> 01:55:45,587
l got that bridge wired with enough to blow it twice.

1422
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:47,505
You can spare some, then.

1423
01:55:47,589 --> 01:55:51,092
You take a standard-issue Gl sock,

1424
01:55:51,176 --> 01:55:54,512
cram it with as much Comp' B as possible,

1425
01:55:54,596 --> 01:55:56,848
rig up a simple fuse,

1426
01:55:56,931 --> 01:55:59,851
then coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1427
01:55:59,934 --> 01:56:02,520
When you throw it, it should stick.

1428
01:56:02,604 --> 01:56:05,398
lt's a bomb that sticks. A sticky bomb.

1429
01:56:05,482 --> 01:56:10,570
You know a better way to knock the tracks off a tank, tell me.

1430
01:56:10,653 --> 01:56:14,574
This is good. Now we got to surrender our socks.

1431
01:56:28,463 --> 01:56:30,089
Haul away.

1432
01:56:43,686 --> 01:56:47,774
Select the field of fire. Cross with the bell tower.

1433
01:56:47,857 --> 01:56:50,276
l can cover 1 2 to nine here.

1434
01:56:54,531 --> 01:56:57,116
- Easy! - l got her!

1435
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,443
Here are the mines.

1436
01:57:43,371 --> 01:57:46,207
For being the best we can do,

1437
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:50,461
that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position.

1438
01:57:52,881 --> 01:57:54,883
And this position right here...

1439
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:59,637
this is the Alamo.

1440
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:03,516
They push us back here, last man blows the bridge.

1441
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,144
We only got a 30-second fuse,

1442
01:58:06,227 --> 01:58:10,648
so that last man better hurry, or he won't be alive long.

1443
01:58:11,774 --> 01:58:13,443
Captain?

1444
01:58:13,526 --> 01:58:15,945
Where am l during all this?

1445
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:20,116
Never more than two feet from me, and that's not negotiable.

1446
01:58:21,493 --> 01:58:23,745
l'll get some ammo. Come on.

1447
01:58:26,748 --> 01:58:27,999
- Upham. - Yes.

1448
01:58:28,082 --> 01:58:30,168
- Listen, all right? - Yeah.

1449
01:58:30,251 --> 01:58:31,753
- Listening? - Yes.

1450
01:58:31,836 --> 01:58:36,341
All right, we'll be displacing and falling back like crazy...

1451
01:58:36,424 --> 01:58:40,470
So be Johnny-on-the-spot with ammo or we're dead.

1452
01:58:40,553 --> 01:58:42,430
- Right. - Understand?

1453
01:58:42,514 --> 01:58:45,517
- Johnny-on-the-spot. - You all right?

1454
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,935
Yeah.

1455
01:58:48,019 --> 01:58:50,230
When we shipped out of England,

1456
01:58:50,313 --> 01:58:53,566
l told the supply sergeant handing out cigarettes,

1457
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,235
''l don't smoke.''

1458
01:58:55,318 --> 01:58:57,320
''l don't smoke.''

1459
01:58:58,905 --> 01:59:01,115
Quite a situation, huh?

1460
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,284
Unbelievable.

1461
01:59:03,368 --> 01:59:04,327
Here.

1462
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:08,873
Fucked up beyond all recognition, right?

1463
01:59:08,957 --> 01:59:10,917
Yeah, you got that right.

1464
01:59:13,545 --> 01:59:14,796
Fubar.

1465
01:59:18,299 --> 01:59:20,385
- Yeah, well... - Fubar.

1466
01:59:20,468 --> 01:59:23,096
lt'll be a real show, huh?

1467
01:59:30,687 --> 01:59:32,480
Take it easy.

1468
01:59:33,731 --> 01:59:35,150
Fubar.

1469
02:00:13,062 --> 02:00:14,731
Who's that singing, sir?

1470
02:00:16,357 --> 02:00:17,775
Edith Piaf.

1471
02:00:19,819 --> 02:00:22,197
What's she so upset about?

1472
02:00:23,281 --> 02:00:24,699
Her lover left her,

1473
02:00:24,782 --> 02:00:28,328
but she still sees his face everywhere she goes.

1474
02:00:29,704 --> 02:00:31,539
That would do it.

1475
02:01:00,693 --> 02:01:01,986
''Even life itself

1476
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:03,655
''only represents you.

1477
02:01:06,783 --> 02:01:09,619
''Sometimes l dream that l'm in your arms.''

1478
02:01:09,702 --> 02:01:13,206
What was that part? She sang that before.

1479
02:01:13,289 --> 02:01:14,958
The chorus.

1480
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:18,044
''And you speak softly in my ear...

1481
02:01:19,838 --> 02:01:22,048
''and you say things

1482
02:01:22,131 --> 02:01:24,300
''that make my eyes close,

1483
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:29,055
''and l find that marvellous.''

1484
02:01:29,139 --> 02:01:32,308
Uh, again...Upham, uh...

1485
02:01:32,392 --> 02:01:36,229
to be honest, l...l find myself curiously aroused by you.

1486
02:01:37,897 --> 02:01:41,359
Marvellous. No, it's... it's a melancholy song.

1487
02:01:41,442 --> 02:01:45,405
At the beginning, she says, ''And then one day, you left.

1488
02:01:45,488 --> 02:01:49,284
''You left me, and, uh... l've been desperate ever since.

1489
02:01:49,367 --> 02:01:52,704
''l see you all over the sky, l see you all over the earth.''

1490
02:01:52,787 --> 02:01:56,958
Any more of this, the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1491
02:01:57,041 --> 02:01:59,335
l'll just slit my own wrists.

1492
02:01:59,419 --> 02:02:01,838
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1493
02:02:01,921 --> 02:02:03,882
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1494
02:02:03,965 --> 02:02:06,843
You know what that song reminds me of?

1495
02:02:06,926 --> 02:02:10,388
What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz said when l left for Basic.

1496
02:02:10,472 --> 02:02:12,932
What, ''Don't touch me''?

1497
02:02:13,016 --> 02:02:15,768
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz is our super's wife.

1498
02:02:15,852 --> 02:02:21,316
She tries things on in my mom's shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE.

1499
02:02:21,399 --> 02:02:24,110
- Double-E? - These things are massive.

1500
02:02:24,194 --> 02:02:25,361
Those are big.

1501
02:02:25,445 --> 02:02:29,032
l've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42-D.

1502
02:02:29,115 --> 02:02:32,368
So she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut,

1503
02:02:32,452 --> 02:02:34,162
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1504
02:02:34,245 --> 02:02:35,997
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1505
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:39,250
And it's beautiful, she's just pouring out of it.

1506
02:02:39,334 --> 02:02:41,377
lt's beautiful, and she can tell

1507
02:02:41,461 --> 02:02:45,590
l got a hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1508
02:02:45,673 --> 02:02:47,717
And she says, ''Richard, calm down.''

1509
02:02:47,801 --> 02:02:50,261
And says, ''When you're over there,

1510
02:02:50,345 --> 02:02:53,264
''if you see anything that upsets you,

1511
02:02:53,348 --> 02:02:58,061
''just close your eyes and think of these. You understand?''

1512
02:02:59,896 --> 02:03:01,898
So l said, ''Yes, ma'am.''

1513
02:03:14,953 --> 02:03:17,247
Are you all right, sir?

1514
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:19,582
Yeah, just keeping the rhythm.

1515
02:03:25,755 --> 02:03:29,717
ls it true you were a teacher back home?

1516
02:03:29,801 --> 02:03:31,219
Yes.

1517
02:03:31,302 --> 02:03:33,721
See, that's something l could never do

1518
02:03:33,805 --> 02:03:38,226
Not after the way we treated our teachers. No, sir.

1519
02:03:40,854 --> 02:03:43,815
l had a thousand kids like you.

1520
02:03:49,404 --> 02:03:51,781
l can't see my brothers' faces.

1521
02:03:52,949 --> 02:03:56,119
l've been trying, and l can't see them.

1522
02:03:56,202 --> 02:03:58,413
Has that ever happened to you?

1523
02:03:58,496 --> 02:04:01,457
You gotta think of a context.

1524
02:04:02,959 --> 02:04:05,128
What does that mean?

1525
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:09,090
Well, you think about something specific...

1526
02:04:09,174 --> 02:04:10,758
something you've done together.

1527
02:04:14,679 --> 02:04:18,224
When l think of home, l think of something specific.

1528
02:04:18,308 --> 02:04:22,145
l think of my hammock in the backyard or...

1529
02:04:22,228 --> 02:04:27,442
my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.

1530
02:04:30,987 --> 02:04:34,407
Well, this one night, two of my brothers came

1531
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:38,203
and woke me up in the middle of the night,

1532
02:04:38,286 --> 02:04:41,623
and they said they had a surprise for me.

1533
02:04:41,706 --> 02:04:45,376
They took me to the barn, into the loft, and...

1534
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:47,670
there was my oldest brother Dan...

1535
02:04:49,255 --> 02:04:52,634
with Alice...Alice Jardine.

1536
02:04:54,928 --> 02:04:59,516
l mean...picture a girl who took a nosedive from the ugly tree

1537
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,935
and hit every branch coming down.

1538
02:05:04,145 --> 02:05:06,815
And...and Dan's got her shirt off.

1539
02:05:06,898 --> 02:05:09,901
So he's working on this bra,

1540
02:05:09,984 --> 02:05:13,613
and all of a sudden, Sean just screams out...

1541
02:05:13,696 --> 02:05:16,741
''Danny, you're a young man! Don't do it!''

1542
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:21,871
And Alice Jardine screams, and jumps up,

1543
02:05:21,955 --> 02:05:27,043
and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head,

1544
02:05:27,126 --> 02:05:30,713
and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.

1545
02:05:30,797 --> 02:05:34,717
So now Dan is so mad, he starts coming after us,

1546
02:05:34,801 --> 02:05:38,763
but Alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.

1547
02:05:38,847 --> 02:05:42,058
So he grabs her leg, and he's dragging her.

1548
02:05:42,142 --> 02:05:45,687
And he picks up a shovel and goes after Sean.

1549
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:50,984
Sean says, ''Why are you trying to hit me? l did you a favour.''

1550
02:05:51,067 --> 02:05:55,488
And this makes Dan more angry. He tries to swing this thing.

1551
02:05:55,572 --> 02:05:59,742
lt goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1552
02:05:59,826 --> 02:06:03,705
The thing explodes, and the whole barn almost goes up.

1553
02:06:19,262 --> 02:06:22,807
That was it...Dan went to Basic next day.

1554
02:06:22,891 --> 02:06:26,853
That was the last night the four of us were together.

1555
02:06:26,936 --> 02:06:28,980
That was two years ago.

1556
02:06:33,776 --> 02:06:37,572
Tell me about your wife and those rose bushes.

1557
02:06:38,948 --> 02:06:39,949
No.

1558
02:06:41,367 --> 02:06:45,121
No. That one l save just for me.

1559
02:07:49,602 --> 02:07:51,271
Enemy from the east.

1560
02:07:52,856 --> 02:07:55,608
He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em.

1561
02:07:55,692 --> 02:07:57,569
Panzer tanks, two of 'em.

1562
02:07:57,652 --> 02:07:59,612
lnfantry,

1563
02:07:59,696 --> 02:08:01,197
50 plus change.

1564
02:08:09,873 --> 02:08:13,918
Disperse! You know what to do! Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1565
02:08:14,002 --> 02:08:15,753
Upham, get some cover.

1566
02:08:15,837 --> 02:08:18,006
Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1567
02:08:18,089 --> 02:08:19,674
Everybody check your ammo!

1568
02:08:20,842 --> 02:08:22,260
Good luck, Reiben.

1569
02:08:22,343 --> 02:08:24,804
l was born lucky, sarge.

1570
02:08:38,485 --> 02:08:39,819
One in five tracer?

1571
02:08:39,903 --> 02:08:41,946
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1572
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:45,450
Yeah? Check her head space and she should run.

1573
02:08:53,708 --> 02:08:56,252
Upham! Hustle up!

1574
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:48,138
- Corporal Upham? - Yes, sir.

1575
02:09:48,221 --> 02:09:50,682
We don't have a .30-calibre here.

1576
02:09:50,765 --> 02:09:53,726
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson needs that.

1577
02:09:53,810 --> 02:09:54,894
Yes, sir.

1578
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:57,397
Upham! Jackson's fine.

1579
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:58,481
Turn around to Mellish.

1580
02:10:20,044 --> 02:10:23,673
l don't know if they took the bait, Captain.

1581
02:10:48,698 --> 02:10:51,075
You got any more of that?

1582
02:11:36,704 --> 02:11:38,665
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1583
02:11:43,753 --> 02:11:46,798
lnfantry's moving to the left.

1584
02:11:46,881 --> 02:11:50,260
Half-track just went by with about 20 troops.

1585
02:13:30,693 --> 02:13:32,904
Displace!

1586
02:13:53,883 --> 02:13:55,718
Do it now! Light it!

1587
02:13:55,802 --> 02:13:57,637
You! Light it!

1588
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,984
30 infantry on the right flank!

1589
02:14:11,067 --> 02:14:13,653
Get over there and stop 'em!

1590
02:14:13,736 --> 02:14:14,904
Displace!

1591
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:27,876
Upham!

1592
02:14:43,516 --> 02:14:44,684
Clear!

1593
02:14:46,936 --> 02:14:47,979
Krauts!

1594
02:14:49,981 --> 02:14:51,107
Right flank!

1595
02:15:03,536 --> 02:15:05,288
Sanitater!

1596
02:15:27,894 --> 02:15:30,939
Get down! Get down!

1597
02:15:37,278 --> 02:15:40,323
Upham! Upham! .30-cal! Hurry!

1598
02:15:40,406 --> 02:15:44,035
And find the captain! This flank's going to fold!

1599
02:16:38,798 --> 02:16:41,217
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1600
02:16:42,802 --> 02:16:45,763
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1601
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:24,135
- Ryan. - Get off me!

1602
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:26,721
- You all right? - Get off me!

1603
02:17:26,805 --> 02:17:28,807
l'm fine, too, Captain(!)

1604
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:31,476
OK, both sides!

1605
02:17:31,559 --> 02:17:33,520
Get a grenade in there!

1606
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:38,608
Grenade!

1607
02:17:40,652 --> 02:17:43,571
- 20-mil! - 20-mil!

1608
02:17:43,655 --> 02:17:45,490
Flak gun. Take it out!

1609
02:17:58,878 --> 02:18:02,215
Heavy weapon below! l ain't got a shot!

1610
02:18:06,886 --> 02:18:08,721
Pincer move, Parker!

1611
02:18:08,805 --> 02:18:10,265
Targets eight o'clock low!

1612
02:18:10,348 --> 02:18:11,307
Shit!

1613
02:18:11,391 --> 02:18:12,934
God grant me strength.

1614
02:18:26,906 --> 02:18:28,867
Come on! Displace!

1615
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:29,951
Come on!

1616
02:18:46,468 --> 02:18:48,052
Cover, Upham! Cover!

1617
02:18:48,136 --> 02:18:49,596
Cover!

1618
02:19:05,904 --> 02:19:08,072
l'm out of .30-calibre.

1619
02:19:10,658 --> 02:19:13,369
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,

1620
02:19:13,453 --> 02:19:15,788
which teaches my hands to war.

1621
02:19:24,756 --> 02:19:27,342
My goodness and my fortress...

1622
02:19:27,425 --> 02:19:29,636
my high tower and my deliverer...

1623
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:35,725
my shield and He in whom l trust.

1624
02:20:03,837 --> 02:20:05,255
Parker, get down!

1625
02:20:27,277 --> 02:20:29,571
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

1626
02:20:29,654 --> 02:20:32,157
We gotta try to flank it.

1627
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:35,827
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1628
02:21:21,998 --> 02:21:24,709
Upham, ammo, Goddamit!

1629
02:22:07,168 --> 02:22:09,963
l'm jammed! l'm jammed! Got any .30-cal?

1630
02:22:10,046 --> 02:22:11,798
- l'm out. - Shit.

1631
02:23:52,148 --> 02:23:55,902
l'm out! l need a bandolier! Anybody got a bandolier?

1632
02:24:21,302 --> 02:24:24,889
God! God!

1633
02:24:27,767 --> 02:24:28,977
You stupid...

1634
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:17,233
Let's stop. Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1635
02:25:17,317 --> 02:25:19,694
No! D-d-d-d...Stop. Stop.

1636
02:25:55,021 --> 02:25:57,690
Son of...son of a bitch!

1637
02:25:57,774 --> 02:26:00,527
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1638
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:02,111
Son of a bitch!

1639
02:26:03,196 --> 02:26:05,114
Son of a bitch!

1640
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:25,445
l'm out.

1641
02:27:25,528 --> 02:27:26,946
Those .60 rounds.

1642
02:27:28,823 --> 02:27:30,200
We can use them without the tube.

1643
02:27:30,283 --> 02:27:31,784
How?

1644
02:27:31,868 --> 02:27:35,205
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1645
02:27:50,136 --> 02:27:51,429
Panzer schreck!

1646
02:28:26,297 --> 02:28:28,341
We're going to the Alamo.

1647
02:28:38,351 --> 02:28:40,228
Alamo! Alamo!

1648
02:29:00,165 --> 02:29:02,208
We'll take it! You fall back!

1649
02:29:02,292 --> 02:29:03,793
You be right behind us!

1650
02:29:03,877 --> 02:29:05,879
Soon as we're in business!

1651
02:29:09,924 --> 02:29:11,176
Displace.

1652
02:29:14,512 --> 02:29:15,513
Reload.

1653
02:30:04,979 --> 02:30:06,564
All right, go.

1654
02:30:07,774 --> 02:30:10,568
We're blowing the bridge! Clear the bridge!

1655
02:30:34,634 --> 02:30:36,970
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1656
02:30:37,053 --> 02:30:41,015
- l just got the winded. - Get out of here!

1657
02:30:41,099 --> 02:30:43,184
We're gonna blow this bridge!

1658
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:46,896
Come on, come on!

1659
02:30:51,568 --> 02:30:53,945
Tiger coming! Coming across the bridge!

1660
02:32:41,719 --> 02:32:42,720
Captain.

1661
02:32:46,432 --> 02:32:49,519
Captain, where are you going? Get back here!

1662
02:35:15,123 --> 02:35:16,958
Hang in there, Captain.

1663
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:03,213
Medic!

1664
02:36:06,758 --> 02:36:07,842
Medic!

1665
02:36:07,926 --> 02:36:09,552
We got a medic?

1666
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:18,353
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51s.

1667
02:36:19,604 --> 02:36:21,439
Angels on our shoulders.

1668
02:36:27,654 --> 02:36:28,780
What, sir?

1669
02:36:34,577 --> 02:36:38,581
James... Earn this.

1670
02:36:43,294 --> 02:36:45,004
Earn it.

1671
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:17,537
My dear Mrs Ryan,

1672
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:20,081
it's with a profound sense of joy

1673
02:37:20,165 --> 02:37:24,961
that l write to inform you your son Private James Ryan

1674
02:37:25,044 --> 02:37:27,547
is well and, at this very moment,

1675
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:30,800
on his way home from European battlefields.

1676
02:37:30,884 --> 02:37:34,929
Reports from the front indicate James did his duty in combat

1677
02:37:35,013 --> 02:37:38,808
with great courage and steadfast dedication

1678
02:37:38,892 --> 02:37:41,561
even after informed of the tragic loss

1679
02:37:41,644 --> 02:37:45,482
your family has suffered in this great campaign

1680
02:37:45,565 --> 02:37:48,776
to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.

1681
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:52,322
l take great pleasure in joining the Secretary of War,

1682
02:37:52,405 --> 02:37:54,240
the United States Army

1683
02:37:54,324 --> 02:37:56,951
and the citizens of a grateful nation

1684
02:37:57,035 --> 02:38:00,330
in wishing you good health and many years of happiness

1685
02:38:00,413 --> 02:38:03,416
with James at your side.

1686
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:08,213
Nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son,

1687
02:38:08,296 --> 02:38:12,759
can compensate you or the thousands of other families

1688
02:38:12,842 --> 02:38:16,262
who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.

1689
02:38:16,346 --> 02:38:19,098
l share with you some words which sustained me

1690
02:38:19,182 --> 02:38:23,520
through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.

1691
02:38:23,603 --> 02:38:26,648
And l quote,

1692
02:38:26,731 --> 02:38:28,650
''l pray that our heavenly father

1693
02:38:28,733 --> 02:38:31,694
''may assuage the anguish of your bereavement

1694
02:38:31,778 --> 02:38:33,947
''and leave you only the cherished memory

1695
02:38:34,030 --> 02:38:35,865
''of the loved and lost

1696
02:38:35,949 --> 02:38:38,827
''and the solemn pride that must be yours

1697
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:41,579
''to have laid so costly a sacrifice

1698
02:38:41,663 --> 02:38:43,998
''upon the alter of freedom.

1699
02:38:44,082 --> 02:38:46,126
''Abraham Lincoln.''

1700
02:38:46,209 --> 02:38:48,795
Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

1701
02:38:48,878 --> 02:38:51,756
George C Marshall, General, Chief of Staff.

1702
02:39:42,932 --> 02:39:46,102
My family is with me today.

1703
02:39:46,186 --> 02:39:48,480
They wanted to come with me.

1704
02:39:50,690 --> 02:39:52,275
To be honest with you,

1705
02:39:52,358 --> 02:39:56,112
l wasn't sure how l'd feel coming back here.

1706
02:39:58,490 --> 02:40:02,202
Every day l think about what you said to me

1707
02:40:02,285 --> 02:40:04,329
that day on the bridge.

1708
02:40:05,497 --> 02:40:10,668
And l've tried to live my life the best l could.

1709
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:13,922
l hope that was enough.

1710
02:40:14,005 --> 02:40:17,091
l hope that, at least in your eyes,

1711
02:40:18,468 --> 02:40:22,305
l've earned what all of you have done for me.

1712
02:40:35,652 --> 02:40:36,945
James.

1713
02:40:39,239 --> 02:40:41,449
Captain John H Miller.

1714
02:40:49,916 --> 02:40:52,710
Tell me l've led a good life.

1715
02:40:52,794 --> 02:40:53,920
What?

1716
02:40:55,004 --> 02:40:57,465
Tell me l'm a good man.

1717
02:41:04,556 --> 02:41:06,182
You are.
