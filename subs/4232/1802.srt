MILES vests to score hits.
你们使用空包弹和激光感应背心来记录命中

the idea is not to get hit.

is straight out of the book.

to outside military forces.
长官，我记得那里外国军队禁止进入

当这个国家不再是比利时殖民地之后，大部分人早已搬走了

54
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,074

Hopefully, you don't find out.

So we're on babysitting duty tomorrow?

This is not a walk in the park.

别担心，伙计。在他们发现是谁揍了他们之前我们就会出来了

- 就像中国的舞会？
- 伙计，你就是头猪，知道吗？

78
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,743

What's that supposed to mean?
那是什么意思？

It means she'll want a man with brains,
and you ain't smart, even for a Marine.
她喜欢长脑子的男人
可惜你一点都不聪明，就算你是海军陆战队

85
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,350

哦，她在往这边看

那不代表什么

Guys, guys, settle down. We're almost there.
伙计们，伙计们，安静。我们就要到了

129
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,120
Mukana's 10 klicks north of here,
just past Uhuru.
再往北10公里就是Mukana，刚好经过Uhuru

130
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,706
What, they've got a town
named after the chick from Star Trek?
什么？他们把镇子取名星际迷航里那个女人？

131
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,209
That's Uhura, dick.
Uhuru is "freedom" in Swahili.
那是Uhura，笨蛋
Uhuru是斯瓦西里语，意思是“自由”

Check out the big brain on the...
检查下大脑子……

133
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,384
Bad joke,
不好笑

134
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,804
since the rebels have driven everyone
out of that part of the country.
叛军把所有人从这个国家的那部分赶出去

135
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,224

- Settle down, Vincent.
- 没错，我听说他们走了

136
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,978
Yes, this may not be Afghanistan or Fallujah,
是的，这可不是阿富汗或费卢杰

137
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,648
but be careful. It's the jungle of the Congo.
要小心。那里是刚果丛林

138
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,985
Okay, jungle faces on.
好的，丛林我们来了

139
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,238
Sounds like a holiday.
听起来像是度假

140
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,451
Hunters?
猎人？

Chandler and his rich European friends
come to get trophies.
Chandler和他的欧洲有钱朋友们来这抢战利品

142
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,837
I thought it was too dangerous
for Europeans in this area.
我认为欧洲人呆在这个区域里真是太危险了

143
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,424
Down here,
hunters are a big part of the economy.
猎人是这里主要的经济来源

144
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,678
They pay good money to the government
and they feed the local villagers.
他们给政府一大笔钱，还养活了当地村民

145
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,137
Keep your eyes open.

146
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,141

Can we speak to you please, sir?

I have no problem here.

Leave this place? I can't.

159
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,627
I'm afraid we're under orders.
我们得执行任务

160
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,879
Screw your orders.

This plantation was built by my father.
这个种植园是我父亲建的

162

and several small uprisings since.
它经历了刚果战争和几次起义

166

My wife is buried out there, for God's sake.
我的妻子就葬在外面，看在上帝的份上

167
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,319
You want me to walk out that door?

I'm sorry, but you have no choice.

带我去见你的指挥官。我要和他谈谈

Sir, I don't know what to say,
先生，我不知道该怎么说

175
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,048
but when the fighting is over,
you could come back.
不过一旦战争结束，你就可以回来

176
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,551
To what?
An empty field where this house once stood?
为了什么？
一块这座房子曾经待过的空地？

177
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,973
No. If you take me out of here,
this place dies, and so do I.

Yeah, great. Never better.
是的，很好。再好不过了

389
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,664
- You're lying.
- Was it at all convincing?
- 你撒谎
- 不相信？

390
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,082
No.
不

391
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,168
It's not much further. We'll make it.
没多远了。我们就快到了

392
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,171
Is that more lying?
又在撒谎？

393
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,966
If it is, then I'm lying to myself, too.
如果是，那我也在欺骗我自己

394
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,711
United Nations!
联合国！

395
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,275
I have to get back. I have to get back.
我得回去。我得回去

396
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,245
Medic! Radio the UN base!
医生！联系联合国基地！

397
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,581
His wound has gone septic.
We need to get him to the hospital now!
他的伤口腐烂了
我们得马上把他送到医院！

398
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,249
What will happen to him?
他会怎么样？

399
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,434
You do not want to feel any strain
on your muscles.
不要让你的肌肉绷紧

400
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:14,689
If you feel stressed, you will not be able
to hold that position without moving.
如果你感觉紧张，你就没法保持稳定

401
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,484
You move, you give away your position.
你动了，你就离开了你的位置

402
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,820
You move, you die.
你动了，你就死了

403
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,741
Now breathe and fire at will.
现在呼吸，自由射击

404
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,120
Once you have your mission,
当你执行任务时

405
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,166
the most important thing for you to do
is identify the location of your hide.
最重要的就是确定你的藏身之地

406
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,671
Now for this, you will use intel.
You will use satellite maps.
为了达到这个目的，你要运用智慧
要用到卫星地图

407
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,131
You will use good
old-fashioned reconnaissance.
也会用到过时但好用的勘测技术

408
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,426
Nakelski, what are we looking for
in the final firing position?
Nakelski，最佳射击位置有什么要求？

409
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,054
Maximum field of fire
and observation of target area,
最大观察和射击范围

410
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,140
concealment from enemy
and clear evac route.
高度隐蔽和安全撤退路线

411
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,018
God damn it, son. You are absolutely right.
小子。完全正确

412
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,189
A hide that seems good to you
will also seem good to the enemy.
在你看来不错的隐藏点，敌人一样会想到

413
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,776
So you want to avoid high spots like towers,
随意最好避开高处，比如塔

414
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,071
like crests of hills
that will get you silhouetted.
比如山顶会暴露你的身影

415
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,325
- Sir.
- Don't salute me, son. I have no rank.
- 长官
- 别向我敬礼，小子。我没有军阶

416
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,577
Thank you, all the same.
谢谢

417
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,454
Once you establish your FFP,
一旦你建立最终射击位置

418
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,040
you may have to hold this position
for several days.
你可能要在那里待上好几天

419
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,085
- Days, sir? How do you...
- You don't.
- 好几天，长官？要怎样……
- 不怎样

420
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,673
You piss your pants and learn to love it.
I love it so much I'm doing it right now.
你要习惯尿在内裤上
我喜欢这样而且现在我正这么做

421
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:29,931
You do not get to use the can
till your mission is completed. Savvy?
直到任务结束你才能去厕所。Savvy？

422
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,060
- Sir.
- Now breathe, fire at will.
- 长官
- 呼吸，自由射击

423
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,529
That must have been a bad one.
那一定是个噩梦

424
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,370
Yeah. I'm burning up.
是啊。我很热

425
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,665
Drink up.
喝掉

426
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,505
Slow down. You'll drown, Sergeant.
慢点。你会淹死的，中士

427
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,134
Where am I?
我在哪

428
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,887
Zimbala, the UN base.
Zimbala，联合国基地

429
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:55,642
It was touch and go for a while,
but your fever broke today.
有一段时间你很糟糕，不过今天你退烧了

430
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,976
You're really lucky you got here in time.
很幸运你能及时到这里

431
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,188
- The girl?
- She's safe. Safe and sound.
- 那个女孩呢？
- 她很安全。安然无恙

432
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,241
I count the holes.
我数过小洞

433
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,995
What?
什么？

434
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,087
Little holes there in the acoustic ceiling.
I count them.
在天花板上的小洞，我数过它们

435
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,213
It helps.
很有用

436
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,757
That helps you sleep?
帮助你入睡？

437
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,635
No.
不是

438
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,849
It helps me stop thinking
about the friends I lost, men I killed.
它让我不再想我死去的兄弟，我杀掉的人

439
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,934
You've killed a lot of men?
你杀过很多人？

440
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,354
Enough.
足够多

441
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:48,111
Killing ain't hard, kid.
It's just pulling the trigger.
杀人不难，孩子。扣下扳机就行

442
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,406
It's living with it after. That's hard.
难的是杀人之后活下去

443
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,118
Who are you, sir?
你是谁，先生？

444
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,370
My name is Miller.
我叫Miller

445
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,207
I'm a friend of your father's,
here to take you home.
我是你父亲的朋友，来带你回家

446
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,758
Excuse me.
抱歉

447
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,488
He cut us down like wheat.
他像割麦子一样杀掉我们

448
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,201
My men died. I should have died with them.
我的人都死了。我本该和他们一起死的

449
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,288
I fell down and I lived. They were killed.
我倒下了却活着。他们都死了

450
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,792
What you're feeling, kid,
it's called survivor guilt.
你现在的感觉，孩子，
通常被称为幸存者的内疚

451
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,461
It's irrational, but it's normal.
这很荒谬，但是也很正常

452
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,132
Someplace inside,
you know it's not your fault.
在内心某处，你知道这不是你的错

453
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,801
You just gotta find that place.
你只要找到那个地方

454
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,638
I know what I need to find.
我知道我要找到什么

455
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,807
What? The sniper? And then what?

456
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,602
Kill him.
杀掉他

457
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,772
You can't fight something
you don't understand.
你没法和未知作战

458
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,859
Hey.
嘿

459
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,365
Being a sniper is something completely
different than being a field trooper.
成为游骑兵和成为狙击手是完全不同的方法

460
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,121
So I should what? Become a sniper?
所以我该怎样？变成狙击手？

461
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,875
No way.
没门

462
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,379
All that sneaky shit?
那些鬼鬼祟祟的垃圾？

463
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,052
That's not fighting, sir.
那不是战斗，先生

464
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,055
Brandon, I know who your father is.
Brandon，我知道你的父亲是怎样的人

465
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,391
So do I.
我也是

466
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,977
Warfare is fighting face to face
in the battlefield.
战争是在战场上面对面的打仗

467
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,064
Sniping the enemy from a hiding place?
That's pure chicken shit.
躲在一个隐蔽的地方狙击敌人？
那完全是胆小鬼的玩意

468
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,900
You gotta face your enemy.
你得面对你的敌人

469
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,237
Is that how you're gonna fight your sniper,
up-close and personal?
那就是你对付狙击手的办法？单枪匹马冲上去？

470
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,281
- I'll figure it out.
- Newsflash, kid.
- 我会解决的
- 最新消息，小子

471
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,450
Half the Congo is at war. It is not our war.
半个刚果都在打仗。这不是我们的战争

472
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,953
It's time to go home.
该回家了

473
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,164
You can go if you want. I'm not finished here.
你想走你走。我在这里还没完

474
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,586
You're weak.
你很虚弱

475
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,007
Your wounds are still healing.
你的伤口还未痊愈

476
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,844
I think I'll stick around.
我想我还得多留几天

477
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,889
Do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me.
随你想做什么。都和我无关

478
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,977
Good night.
晚安

479
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,999
On your feet.
站起来

480
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,920
What are we doing?
我们这是干什么？

481
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,632
Quiet. Take this.
安静。拿着这个

482
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,803
There, by the perimeter tower.
那里，边上那座塔

483
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,730
- You see the sentry?
- I see the back of his head.
- 看到哨兵了吗？
- 我看到他的后脑

484
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,856
Good. Shoot him.
很好。向他射击

485
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,234
- You want me to shoot him?
- He is your target. Take him out.
- 你要我向他射击？
- 他是你的目标。干掉他

486
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,488
Who is he?
他是谁？

487
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,907
He's leaking information to the rebels.
他向叛军走漏情报

488
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,201
Now you have your assignment.
Take him out.
现在你有任务。干掉他

489
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,662
- Look, I don't even know who this...
- You don't need to know.
- 嘿，我甚至还不知道他是……
- 你不需要知道

490
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,830
What's the distance?
距离多少？

491
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,875
- Two hundred yards.
- And how do you know that?
- 200码
- 你怎么知道的？

492
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,545
- Through the scope. He's 10 mils high.
- Good. Switch him off.
- 通过望远镜。他只有1厘米高
- 很好。干掉他

493
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,218
What are you waiting for, sniper?
You have your assignment. Shoot.
你在等什么，狙击手？
你有任务。射击

494
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,607
- No.
- No?
- 不
- 不？

495
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,109
- I need to know more...
- What do you need to know?
- 我需要知道……
- 你想知道什么？

496
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,986
That man is the fucking enemy.
You put a bullet in his head.
那个人是他妈的敌人
你要把子弹射到他的头里去

497
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,530
I don't kill indiscriminately.
我不会随便杀人

498
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,741
Correction. You don't follow orders.
订正。你不会服从命令

499
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,869
You're not ready to take on a sniper, kid,
你还没准备好变成狙击手，小子

500
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,664
because he would shoot that man
on command.
因为狙击手会按照命令射击

501
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,916
Empty.
空的

502
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,001
So, end of the lesson.
所以，课程结束

503
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,683
Captain Ngoba, according to your report,
Ngoba上尉，根据你的报告

504
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,351
your men were in a direct attack,
你的人曾遭遇一次直接攻击

505
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,979
and you were separated
from the rest of the unit.
而你又和剩下的人被分开

506
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,024
Once you determined
your men had been killed
当你得知你的人被杀

507
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,486
and lacking sufficient cover,
you chose to retreat to base.
而你又缺少足够的掩护，你决定撤回基地

508
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,488
- And leave the rest of us to die.
- Sergeant!
- 不管我们剩下的人死活
- 中士！

509
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,076
- Is that a correct reading of your report?
- Yes, sir.
- 对你的报告的解释没错吧？
- 是的，长官

510
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,578
That will be all, Captain.
就这样，上尉

511
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,212
Lieutenant Abramowitz,
do we know who these attackers were?
Abramowitz中尉，知道攻击者从哪里来吗？

512
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,174
It seems like a squad-sized force.
看起来像是一小队武装分子

513
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,510
However, I think it may have been
one shooter.
但是，我认为只有一个射手

514
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,012
That seems unlikely, no?
那不太可能，是吧？

515
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:10,266
The medics removed a Russian .30 caliber
rifle round from his shoulder.
医生从他的肩膀里取出一颗苏制.30口径步枪子弹

516
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,395
One hundred forty-seven grains,
one in 11.5-inch twist.

Are you sure about the twist?

518
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,231
It's what it says here.

Colonel, the rebels use Soviet weapons.

11.5英寸。那是我们的武器

- 我们的？

523
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,749
uses that twist.
使用那个缠距

有人曾把苏制子弹装填进美军狙击步枪

of every caliber in this country.
在这个国家有几百万种武器，所有口径都有

Sir, if I may, just one more thing.
长官，还有一件事情

527
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,554
Ballistic suggests it was a sniper,
弹道分析结果认为那是一个狙击手

528
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,225
but it must have been a squad
that returned and sanitized the scene.
不过一定有一个小队回来过打扫战场

and made it look like looting.

So? We'll never know.

That's it?

Sergeant, we've done all we can do.

Doesn't look like you've done anything.
看起来你什么都没做

The Colonel means the UN doesn't have
the time or manpower to investigate.

Don't you care about what happened?

That's beside the point.

The conflict in the DRC is a flashpoint.

how this will affect diplomatic relations.

544
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,724
I can look into it on my own.

545

Oh, no. That's the last thing we need.
哦，算了。那是我们最不需要的

We cannot afford you
running into the middle
我们不会支持你

547
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,942
of an international incident
like a cowboy, Sergeant.
像个牛仔一样跑到一场国际事件中间去，中士

548
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,112
Until further notice,
you are confined to base.
在收到通知之前，你被限制在基地内

549
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,834
Yeah, Captain? What do you want?
I heard your story back there.
怎么，上尉？你想怎样？
我在后面听到了你的故事

00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,337
No, you did not, Sergeant.
不，你没有，中士

551
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,800
Your men do not respect my men.
We both know this.
你的人不尊重我的人，我们都清楚这点

552
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:14,265
But we are African soldiers
and you are Marines.
但是我们是非洲战士，而你们是海军陆战队

553
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,019
That does not mean you can judge me.
那不意味着你们可以审判我

554
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,813
This is my country.
这是我的国家

555
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,567
We did not ask for you and people like you
to come here.
我们没请求你和你这样的人跑到这来

556
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:31,866
It is unfortunate about your men,
but I did what I thought was best at the time.
你的人很不幸
可是我在那时做了我认为最好的行动

557
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,015
Brandon?

558
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,269
They told me you were still here.
I was surprised.
他们告诉我你还在这里。我很惊讶

559
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,941
They're still trying to contact my aunt.
They told me you might die.
他们还在尝试联系我的姑妈
他们告诉我你可能死了

560
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,654
The medics always make it sound
worse than it is
医生总是危言耸听

561
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,781
so they can look like miracle workers
when you pull through.
所以当你恢复健康的时候，他们就像是奇迹制造者

562
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,956
I brought you some DVDs.
The Michael Jackson movie, Jonas Brothers.
我给你带了一些DVD

You know, some of my favorites.

565

Maybe you can trade them.

Kelli, have you had any more thoughts about
who may have wanted to kill your father?
Kelli，关于谁想杀掉你父亲，你有没有别的想法？

I already told that woman.

I don't know anyone who would.
我不知道还有谁

In the house, there was a picture
of your father with some soldiers.
在房子里，有一张你父亲和一些士兵的合影

571
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,699
It wasn't there when we went back.
You know the one?
当我们回去的时候它没了。你知道吗？

572
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,451
Yes.
是的

Was your father in the army?

他和叛军、当地部落以及刚果军队都有生意

为了我们家的安全，他只能这么做

Sorry. I'm not used to the Officers' Mess.
抱歉。我不习惯军官餐厅

It's been a long time
since I've seen a tablecloth.

Here you go, sir.
这是你的，先生

No, no. This is great.

你邀请我共进晚餐
不会只是因为你发现我很有吸引力吧

I think you know more than you're letting on.
我觉得你在装糊涂

You spoke to Kelli.
You know her father traded with the rebels.
你和Kelli谈过

这事只在这说说

Chances are it was more than a rebel attack.

595
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,061
It would be a suicide mission.

So you joined the Marines?

I thought it would help me get over that.

to know something about you?

My father was a sergeant major
in the SAS at Hereford.

Fun? Who know.
有趣？谁知道

616
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,498

to grow up surrounded by people

617
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,919
that had dedicated their lives to something
grander than themselves. Their country.
在这些人中间长大确实很有意思

618
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,507
So, I followed in his footsteps.

Is that what you wanted to hear?

- No.

00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,701
Into the Congo?

If you go up against a sniper
in your condition,

Look, kid, last night was what we called
a "stress fire" exercise.
嘿，小子，昨晚我们进行的是“强迫开火”练习

Hell, I went through it. It's just a test.
每一个狙击手都要通过它
我也通过了。那只是个测试

640
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:55,726
And I failed, right? But you, you can save me.
我失败了，对吧？但是你，你会救我的

641
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,395
Not until you get yourself into trouble.

What did you think you were gonna do?

646
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,293
I needed help.
我需要帮助

647
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,296
In all of Africa, I knew there was one man
who could help me get to the rebels.
在整个非洲，我知道有一个人能帮我接近叛军

648
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,261

were getting these weapons,

649
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,639
including the one I was shot with.

650
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,975

Here.

654
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,732
Ma'am, it's okay. It's okay.
女士，没事。没事

655
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,273
I just came to bring your gun back.
我把你的枪带回来了

656
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,948
- Why the hell did you come back here?
- I need your help.
- 你他妈的为什么回来了
- 我需要你的帮助

657
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,618
The sniper who shot me,
he's out there working with the rebels.
那个击中我的狙击手，在为叛军工作

658
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,870

- How the hell can I help you?
- 我要找到他
- 我要怎么帮你？

659
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:48,500
Listen, I'll help you get your kids back
if you take me to the rebels.
听着，如果你把我带到叛军那里，我会帮你把孩子们找回来

660
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,966
I know where they're getting the guns.
我知道他们从哪拿到的武器

661
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,400
Come on, son.
来把，孩子

662
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,326
Africa is a place more alive
than any you've ever been to.
非洲是你去过的地方中最有活力的

663
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,578
You heed her rules,
and she'll take care of you.
你遵守她的规则，她就会关心你

664
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,957
You stray, and your bones
will bleach in tomorrow's sun.
如果你乱跑，明天的太阳就会照在你的骨头上

665
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,128
Now, if you're up against an enemy
that can kill you,
现在，如果你要对抗会杀掉你的敌人

666
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,381
that first clean bore shot
could save your life.
先清理干净枪管可能会救你的命

667
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,093
Another patch.
再补充一点

668
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,807
There is a chance that they can kill you
before you even get close to your target.
很可能在你接近你的目标前他们就会杀了你

669
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,309
I'll get to my target.
我会接近我的目标

670
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,477
Are you sure about that?
你能保证吗？

671
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,941
Soldiers just bull their way into situations.
It's the way they're trained.
士兵们总会用说大话使自己进入状态
他们就是这么训练的

672
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,359
But a hunter's got to stalk.
猎人必须保持隐匿

673
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,445

he's gotta use the terrain to his advantage.
当猎人潜行时，他会利用地形制造优势

674
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,281
It's basic training.
这是基本训练

675
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,575
No. There's more to it than that.
不，这里面有很多学问

676
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:49,955
When you're stalking your prey,
you gotta become one with the land.
当你潜行靠近猎物时
你要和大地融为一体

677
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,791
You probably know that
from your father, huh?
也许你已经从你父亲那学过，恩？

678
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,003
Unfortunately, no. I never knew him that well.
很不幸，没有。我从来不知道他有那么棒

679
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,506
I became a grunt to spite him.
我当兵就是为了气他

680
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,093
And what does he think about that?

681
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,014
I don't know.

The men who attacked my camp.

683
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,156
Criminals led by a man that claims himself
the spokesperson of God.
带领那些罪犯的人自称是神的代言人

684
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,327
- There will be no negotiating.
- I wasn't expecting any.
- 没法谈判
- 我也没指望过

685
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,215
Shit.
操

686
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,054
- Those are your kids.
- Yeah.
- 那是你的孩子们
- 没错

687
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,640
They're going to take them
to the other rebel camps.
他们要把孩子们带到别的营地

688
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,851
I got to get them out of there now.
我得马上把他们救出来

689
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,230
Okay, if you can distract them,
I'll make my way down there behind them.
好的，如果你能转移他们的注意力
我可以溜到他们后面去

690
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,356
Are you up for this?
你准备好了吗？

691
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,193
Let's do it.
干吧

692
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,236
Okay.
好的

693
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,386
Someone's helping us.
有人在帮我们

694
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,528
There's someone else out there.
外面还有别人

695
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,867
No! He's on our side.
不！他是我们这边的

696
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,133
Who the hell is this?

Martin Chandler, this is Richard Miller.

698
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,221
You never told me your rank.
你还没告诉过我你的军阶

699
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,099
Not important. How you doing?

700
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,392
So, you're a spook?
你是个密探？

701
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,019
Friendly ghost.
友好的幽灵

702
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:27,691
Okay, guys. Help each other, find everyone
and get on that truck, okay?
好了，伙计们。互相帮助
把所有人找齐然后上那辆卡车，好吗？

703
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:28,817
What are you doing here?
你在这做什么？

704
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,318
I'm here to save your life.
我来救你的命

705
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,862
Never met you before,
but you flew halfway around the world
我以前没见过你，不过你飞了半个地球过来

706
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,948
just to give me a ride home.

Right. You know something.
是的。你知道什么

708
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,411
I know snipers aren't sent
to kill squads of men.
我知道狙击手不会被派来杀掉一个小队

709
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,372
They're assigned a specific target.
他们应该被分配到特殊目标

710
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:46,418
Your men were collateral damage.
Van Brunt was the primary target.
你的人只是附带的
Van Brunt是主要目标

711
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,585
How do you know all of this?

- 什么？
- 他们叫他‘意大利人’

715
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,682
But he's not Italian,
he's not Russian or Somalian.
不过他不是意大利人
也不是俄罗斯人或索马里人

716
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:05,812
His name is Vincent Masiello,
and he's an American. He's a Marine.
他叫Vincent Masiello

717
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,606
We were shot by one of our own. Why?

718
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,608
I don't know why.
我不知道

719
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,820
All I know is that order had to come
from pretty high up in the chain of command.
我只知道命令是从很高级的管理层下来的

720
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,952
Operation like that, I have to assume
这种操作手段，我不得不推测

721
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,289
they wanted to keep Van Brunt
from revealing delicate information.
他们想要阻止Van Brunt泄露敏感信息

722
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,542
He was the one supplying U.S. weapons
to the rebels.
他是叛军的美军武器供应商

723
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,210
Then he must have got them
from somebody on our side.
他一定是从我们这里的某人那里拿到武器

724
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,505
That's the kind of something the military
would want to keep from the public.
那正是军队想对公众隐瞒的

725
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,675
Is that why you're here?
Are you part of this cover-up?
那就是你来这的原因？
你也是这个掩饰的一部分？

726
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,678
If I were, we wouldn't be talking.
You'd be dead.
如果我是，我们就不会在这谈话了

I'm not here on anyone's orders.
我来这不是任何人的命令

was ambushed in Africa,
当我听说Tom Beckett的儿子在非洲遭到伏击

and bring him back before he got killed.
我就决定赶过去，在他被杀掉前带他回来

730
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,521
Why do you care?

731
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,734
I care because I knew your father.
我担心是因为我认识你父亲

732
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,864
He was my friend. He was my teacher.

他是我的朋友。他是我的老师
他教我怎么做一个狙击手

733
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,824
And he saved my life.
而且他救过我的命

734
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,496
Look, I'm not going back until I'm done here.
恩，除非我把这事了了，不然我不会回去

735
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,166
Does that include your funeral?
Because you will never see Masiello coming.
要包括你的葬礼吗？
因为你永远不会看到Masiello

736
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,169
Then I need to make him come to me.
那么我就需要让他来找我

737
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,175
Hello?
喂？

738
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,761
- Ellen.

739
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,138
Where the hell are you?
你到底在哪？

740
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,807
I know who killed our men.
我知道是谁杀了我们的人

741
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,892
I need protection.
You have to send a team to come pick me up.
我需要保护。你得派支队伍来接我

742
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,852
You know I don't have the authority
to do that.
你知道我没有权力这么做

743
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,020
I'll be right on the border.
我会在边境线上

01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,026
Thanks.
谢谢

747
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,029
You can trust her?

I don't have to.
我没必要相信

749
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:45,328
If the conspiracy is coming from the base,
it won't be legit UN force that'll show up.
如果阴谋出自基地，联合国军队不会光明正大的来

750
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,038
It'll be Masiello, coming to kill me.

Uhuru，那个镇在Zimbala和刚果交界处。今天13：00

01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,174
I cannot risk any more of the men
in my command.
我不能让我的人再冒任何危险

754
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:02,303

who ambushed his men.
Beckett说他有关于伏击他们的人的证据

755
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,097

要从现在的临时政府

756
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,933
from whoever passes
for today's provisional government.

757
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,726
We won't need a full-scale operation.

I could get him myself.

Thank you, sir.
谢谢你，长官

Zambia. Maybe Namibia.

769
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,318
It's good hunting there.
At least they'll be safe.

I'm ready.
我准备好了

773

He's not coming alone.

You're gonna have to engage the primary

你得挨家挨户抵抗敌人进攻
选好你的位置

777
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,961
Is the com working?

- Loud and clear.

Here. It's an LAR Grizzly Mark I.

I didn't know we had an artillery piece.

A little souvenir your father gave me.
你父亲留给我的纪念品

以防他单枪匹马摸上来
另外，它一直在磨我的屁股

784
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,939
I don't know what to say.
我不知道该说什么

785
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,817
Let the weapon do the talking.

786
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,278
Where are you gonna be?

787
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,406
I'm going high.
我要去高处

788
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,950

- 藏在高处从来不是个好主意

789
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:12,744
Same person who taught you.
教你的那个人

790
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,330
Well, you're right.
This time, we're doing the ambush.
好吧，你是对的
这次，轮到我们来埋伏了

791
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,251
I still don't know why you're staying in this.
我还是不明白你为什么要待在这里

792
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:25,423
I told you. I trained Masiello.
I didn't train him to kill Americans.
我告诉过你。我训练过Masiello
我从没教过他杀美国人

793
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,091
What about when you get back to Pendleton?

You're gonna answer for this.

01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,097
We're not gonna live through this.
我们这次可能活不下去

Vehicle coming. Look alive.
有车来了。注意

until I make contact with him.
你在车上等，Ngoba上尉，等我和他接触

Beckett?

803
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,674
Beckett!

804
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,869

807
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,290

01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,708
Who is that young lady looking for?

- Me.

What is this?
这是什么？

811
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,046
It was supposed to be an ambush,
but you weren't supposed to be here.
这是个埋伏，但是你不应该在这里

812
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,549
Ambush?
Tell me exactly what's going on here.
埋伏？告诉我到底是怎么回事

813
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,595
We got company.

01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:40,308
UN 'flag, cute red hats. Doubt they're legit.
联合国徽章，可爱的小红帽
我觉得他们是真的

816
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,226
Anyway, they're taking position
around the perimeter.
不管怎样，他们正在周围抢占位置

817
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:43,394
I brought soldiers from the base.

They didn't come with me.

他们不是来带我回去的
他们要把我们都杀了

824
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,168
Beckett! Give yourself up.
Beckett！放弃抵抗

825
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,462
We have no choice.
我们别无选择

826
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,672
I'll explain later, if we live.
稍后我会解释，如果我们都还活着

827
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,984
Beckett?
You trained us well, no?
Beckett？你把我们练得不错，是不是？

828
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,031
No! They're still stacking up!

I see you.
我看到你了

830
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,964

- 一箭双雕
- 你见过吗？

831
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,178
- Are you all right?
- Are you kidding?

832
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:04,976
Lieutenant.

833
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,478
Ellen. We're ready to move.

What's the plan?

我会吸引他们的火力
你就直接跑出去

837
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,865

- 好的

838
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,744
Be careful.
小心

839
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,001
See you back at the base.
基地见

840
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:02,908
Go, go, go!

841
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,726
Chasing down Ngoba?
要追Ngoba？

842

Where is he? Masiello!

848
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,687
- I don't know.
- Who's behind this?
- 我不知道
- 是谁下的命令？

我没有证据

851
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,527
Jäger?

01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,548
And we are next.
然后就是我们

859
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:07,491

Miller, do you read me?

baby Beckett.
我的老教练没法说话，小Beckett

862
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:17,543
Masiello.

863
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,003
That saves introductions.
看起来不用介绍了

864
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,673
Last time we met, I missed you.

I'm gonna correct that mistake.

You still with me, baby Beckett?

Not good enough, Beckett.

Son of the great Thomas Beckett.

Your father wouldn't have missed.

Let's see how you handle night vision.

What are you dragging this out for?

Well, that wasn't even close.

Won't miss next time.

by midday.

Miller had disappeared.
Miller失踪了

01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,899
It took most of the next day for us
to get back to the base
我们花了很长时间才回到基地

879
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,695

who arranged to bring me back here.
我在那和美国领事馆联系
他们安排我回到这里

In your debriefing,
you said you believed a coalition officer
在你的报告中，你说你确信有联军军官

881
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,158
- was conspiring with the rebels.
- Yes.

to corroborate your accusation?

886
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,931
I'm afraid without further evidence,
如果没有足够证据

887
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,643
I have no choice but to proceed
with the court-martial.
恐怕我只能继续本次军事法庭审判

What are you gonna do about that?

The U.S. military can do nothing officially.
美军官方对此无能为力

891
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,612
We have rules to obey, regulations to follow.

892
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,133
Of course, you don't.
当然，你不需要

893
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:30,689
Peter? Hans?

I think it's broken.
我想它坏了

895
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,532
Your security detail
won't be coming, Colonel.

01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,412
You killed them?

I don't kill indiscriminately. I'm not you.

898
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:53,504

01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,848
You know how this works, right?

You're here to kill me?

906
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:09,978
Ngoba told you that?
Ngoba告诉你的？

907
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,105
Yes.
是的

908
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,565
Well, he's dead.
他死了

909
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,736
Think he would have testified?
