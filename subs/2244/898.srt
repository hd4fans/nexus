1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Blind Side 2009

2
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,470
There's a moment of orderly silence

3
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,220
before a football play begins.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,240
Players are in position, linemen are frozen,

5
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,320
And anything's possible.

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,750
Then, like a traffic accident, staff begins to randomly collide.

7
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,640
From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,090
Is closer to four seconds than five.

9
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,620
One mississippi.

10
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,880
Joe Theismann, the redskins quarterback

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,170
Takes the snap and hands off to his running back.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,670
Two mississippi.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,080
It's a trick play, a flea flicker,

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,110
And the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,210
Three mississippi.

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,355
Up to now the play's been defined

17
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:27,450
by the what the quarterback sees.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,650
It's about to be defined by what he doesn't.

19
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,980
Four mississippi.

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,730
Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,400
And has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie.

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,920
He will also change the game of football as we know it.

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,660
...and we'll look at it with the reverse angle one more time.

24
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,830
And I suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch ...

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,147
Legendary quarterback Joe Thiesmann

26
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:02,610
never played another down of football.

27
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,130
Now, y'all would guess that more often than not

28
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,680
The highest paid player on an NFL team is the quarterback.

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,020
And you'd be right.

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,920
What you probably don't know is that more often than not

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,620
The second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor,

32
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,960
A left tackle.

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,970
Because, as every housewife knows,

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,110
The first check you write is for the mortgage

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,890
But the second is for the insurence.

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,730
And the left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback

37
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,180
From what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side.

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,420
The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,490
He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs.

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,700
He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup.

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,520
This is a rare and expensive combination

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,410
The need for which can be traced to that monday night game

43
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,460
And Lawrence Taylor.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,470
For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life,

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,940
But mine as well.

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,720
Mr. Oher?

47
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,750
Mr. Oher?

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,650
Do you understand..? Do you know why I'm here?

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,200
To... investigate?

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,200
Yes. To investigate.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,150
Do you find the odd? Your predicament?

53
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,580
Michael?...

54
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,020
Iono.

55
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,130
Can I... can I leave now?

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,830
No. You can't.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,720
# strange face, with your eyes #

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,990
# so pale and sincere #

59
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,310
# underneath, you know well #

60
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,500
# you have nothing to fear #

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,730
# for the dreams that came to you #

62
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,760
# when you were young #

63
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,890
# told of a life where #

64
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,470
# spring has crawled #

65
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,310
# you would seem so frail #

66
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,150
# in the cold of the night #

67
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,550
# when the armies of emotion #

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,390
# go out to fight #

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,990
# but while the earth #

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,820
# sinks to its grave #

71
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,750
# you sail to the sky #

72
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,570
# on the crest of a wave #

73
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,370
They say you the coach.

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
Bert Cotton.

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,650
Tony Hamilton, but everybody just calls me big Tony.

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Hey, big Mike! Check it out.

77
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,210
Not even locked!

78
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,670
White people are crazy.

79
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,130
I promises my mama boo, on her deathbed

80
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,239
That I'd get my son Steven outta public school

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,930
And into a church school.

82
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,060
I appreciate that, Tony. But I'm not involved with admissions.

83
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,220
This figured maybe I'd come to talk to you,

84
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,370
Seeing as you might need some players.

85
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,920
What kind of sport is he playing?

86
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,080
Anything with a ball. Boy's good, too.

87
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,380
Classes start in a week.

88
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,430
It would have to be for the next semester.

89
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,025
I know, what you're thinking, coach. But,

90
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,910
look here, I got money, alright?

91
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,910
See I'm mechanic at wilson's auto t'other side of town.

92
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,410
Look, what if somebody drops out or moves?

93
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,670
Could they get in then?

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,150
"They?" you only mentioned one son.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,450
That's right, Steven. But there's another boy.

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,490
- Another boy?  - Yeah.

97
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,560
Big Mike.

98
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,580
Sleeps on my coach from time to time.

99
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,310
It's a bad deal. You know, his mama's on the crack pipe.

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,260
He ain't got nobody else.

101
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,220
He just wanted to come along for the ride.

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,370
- They're here? - Yeah.

103
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,520
The little one is Steven

104
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,260
And the big one...

105
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,810
Big Mike.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,990
Swish!

107
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,350
Mike!

108
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on!

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,670
Mother of god....

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,770
Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable to me.

111
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,070
And I believe he would do fine.

112
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,130
- but this other kid... - Big Mike.

113
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,720
Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe it,

114
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,390
Based on his record, that he would be successful here.

115
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,950
How bad could it be?

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,680
We're not exactly sure how old he is due to lack of records.

117
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,290
He has a measured iq of 80. Which is 6th percentile.

118
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,300
His grade point average begins with zero.

119
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,740
Zero-point-six.

120
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,890
Everyone passed him along

121
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,233
They gave him d's so they could hand

122
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,590
their problem off to the next school.

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,110
It's a brave kid.

124
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,580
For wanting to come here.

125
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,020
For wanting a quality education.

126
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,306
An education denied him by the poor

127
00:08:41,307 --> 00:08:43,670
quality of the schools he's attended.

128
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,310
I tell you most kids with his background

129
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,620
Wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place.

130
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,263
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest

131
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,730
in this young man's athletic abilities.

132
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,476
Now, he wouldn't be able to play sports

133
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:55,860
until he got his grades up anyway.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,860
Forget sports!

135
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,960
Look at the wall.

136
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,220
Christian.

137
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,720
We either take that seriously or we paint over it.

138
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,350
You don't admit Michael Oher because of sports,

139
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,120
You admit him because it's the right thing to do.

140
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,930
Class, this is Michael Oher and he's new here

141
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,750
So I expect you all to make him feel welcome.

142
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,350
Mike, just take any empty seat.

143
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,090
This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year

144
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,300
In your science curriculum.

145
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't worry. It's not gonna be graded.

146
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,170
I just want to see how much information we need to hit again.

147
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,720
Just answer whatever you know.

148
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,620
Thank you.

149
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,280
- Can I leave now? - Yeah.

150
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,240
Take your book.

151
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,760
Why should he always stay in our home?

152
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,100
- He's gonna eat all our food. - This is not true.

153
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,760
I try to be Christian abot the son, alright?

154
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,160
Let somebody else be Christian about this kid.

155
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,560
You want me to throw him out on the street like some dog?

156
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,550
Let somebody else take over the responsibility!

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,420
Should I throw him out on the street?

158
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,750
He's here all the time. I just want to be with you!

159
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,120
Alright. Alright.

160
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,400
You win. I'll take care of it.

161
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,540
I don't care if Patrick Ramsey approved the chair.

162
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,690
He's the NFL quarterback

163
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,340
not Martha frickin' Stewart.

164
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,581
Because there's a difference between

165
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:21,450
Bunny Williams and a la-z-boy.

166
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,210
No. See, when MTV cribs comes to his house

167
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,140
He's gonna be showing off his home theatre

168
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,560
All I'm gonna see is a brown barca-lounger.

169
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,710
No. No, listen to me. I'm the designer, my name's on it.

170
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,860
Deliver what I ordered! alright? Thank you.

171
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,220
- What'd I miss? - Collins has just got a dig.

172
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,020
It's a girl's volleyball, mom. You didn't miss anything.

173
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,510
- Come on Collins! move your feet! come on! - Good job, Collins!

174
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,060
Go!

175
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,100
Collins, we're gonna wait for you outside.

176
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,410
But don't double condition in the shower, you have homework!

177
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,210
I'm going over to Cannon's to study.

178
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,320
SJ! SJ, do not go to the girl's locker room again.

179
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,700
Come here! SJ, come here!

180
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,230
Well, the big kid's been here for a month

181
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,890
He's still not cutting in my class.

182
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,620
Why does admissions do this?

183
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,810
I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.

184
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,600
Just setting him up to fail.

185
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,080
I don't think, he has any idea what I'm teaching.

186
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,690
And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk.

187
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,560
- He writes. - His name. Barely.

188
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,060
He thew this in the trash can.

189
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,060
I look, and I see white everywhere

190
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,680
White walls, white floors, and a lot of white people.

191
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,347
The teachers do not know I have no idea

192
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,570
of anything they are talking about.

193
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,370
I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers.

194
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,700
They are giving homework and

195
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,830
Expecting me to do problems on my own.

196
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,630
I have never done homework in my life.

197
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,990
I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say,

198
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,400
"This is not Michael Oher."

199
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,950
He entitled it "White walls."

200
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,950
How's the spelling?

201
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,220
Hi.

202
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,170
Smile at 'em.

203
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,060
And that let them know you're their friend.

204
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,330
You're big Mike, right?

205
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm Sean. But everyone calls me SJ.

206
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,750
It's for Sean Junior,

207
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,250
My father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.

208
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,920
He was a basketball star at Ole Miss, point guard,

209
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,470
Now he owns like a million Taco Bells.

210
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,840
Maina'.

211
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,330
- Who's that SJ? - Big Mike.

212
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,460
Get you feet off my dash.

213
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Thank you. Put on your seatbelt!

214
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,720
Big Mike?

215
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,670
Mike, I got a call from someone at the police departement.

216
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,660
Do you remember the story in the papers while back about...

217
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,680
A man who fell off an overpass?

218
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,980
No one knew who he was and or he jumped, or...

219
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,520
Umm... anyway he... he passed away.

220
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,020
Mike, the man was your father.

221
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,440
They've been looking for somebody to notify and they...

222
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,340
They found your name on our registry.

223
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm really sorry, son.

224
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,190
You were close to him?

225
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,270
When's the last time you saw him?

226
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,170
Iono.

227
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
- He knows it! - Who knows it and what is he know?

228
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,940
The material. Michael Oher. I gave him this test verbally.

229
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,860
- That even allowed? - A C?

230
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,740
- On how big a curve?  - He's been listening all along.

231
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,865
It's amazing what he's absorbed. Trust me.

232
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,200
He's listening to you, too.

233
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,740
Now, his reading level is low

234
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,890
And he's got no idea how to learn in the classroom.

235
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:06,020
I'm not saying he's going to pass but Big Mike is not stupid.

236
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
What, mom?

237
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,840
- Good job. - Yes?

238
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,700
Good job. Hey, I got a question for you.

239
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,970
Go.

240
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,260
There was a little girl about two rows back.

241
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,540
What was her name?

242
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,000
- oh, that was Kinsey. - Kinsey. Yeah.

243
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,280
I saw your little indian feathers get all ruffle up.

244
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,930
Yeah. She's nice.

245
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,180
SJ, don't let this go to your head but I've thought you were

246
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,120
very convincing in the role of...

247
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,130
- Indian number three. - Yes.

248
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,770
I tried out for the chief but they gave it to Andy Sung.

249
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,917
I can't be sure, but I think there was

250
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:37,070
some multi-cultural bias thing working.

251
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,830
Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better chief.

252
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,860
Dad, he's like Chinese.

253
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,470
Yeah. You're Irish.

254
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,750
And if you weren't the chief, how did you get that headdress?

255
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,950
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of those free Quesadilla tickets.

256
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,140
And where does the acorn fall?

257
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,400
Hey, don't laugh too hard. The quesadilla saved our ass.

258
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,580
Don't use the a-word.

259
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,010
What is he wearing?

260
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,295
It's freezing.

261
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,030
What's his name again?

262
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,580
Big Mike.

263
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,250
Where's he going?

264
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,150
Hey, Big Mike! Where you headin'?

265
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,390
Gym....

266
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,510
Go ahead.

267
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,460
Turn around.

268
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,740
Big Mike... stop the car.

269
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,240
Big Mike.

270
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
Hey, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy.

271
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
My kids go to Wingate.

272
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,100
You said you're going to the gym?

273
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,615
The school gym's closed.

274
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,780
Why were you going to the gym?

275
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,330
Big Mike?! Why were you going to the gym?

276
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,170
Because... it's warm.

277
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,440
Do you have any place to stay tonight?

278
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,340
Don't you dare lie to me.

279
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,510
I've seen that look many times.

280
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,660
She's about to get her way.

281
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,030
Come on.

282
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,510
Come on.

283
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,310
SJ, make room.

284
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,300
Get in the car.

285
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,600
Come on.

286
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,320
- Where are we going?  - Home.

287
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,950
Oh no! That's my favourite part.

288
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,610
So cute.

289
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,420
How'd the dork do in the school play?

290
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,895
Umm... okay.

291
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,170
Collins, you know Big Mike from the school?

292
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,650
I'd give you the guest bedroom but it's full of sample boxes.

293
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,510
And the sectional in the family room

294
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:45,220
slides apart when you sleep on it.

295
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,510
At least that's what Sean says.

296
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,550
Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the coach?

297
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,310
Only when he's bad. Alright.

298
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,215
The powder room's right there

299
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:55,070
and we'll be upstairs if you need us.

300
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
Alright? Right.

301
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,080
Sleep tight, honey.

302
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,760
- Was this a bad idea?  - What?

303
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,753
Don't lie there and pretend like you're

304
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,300
not thinking the same thing as me.

305
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,690
Fine, tell me what you're thinking

306
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,230
so I know what's supposed to be on my mind

307
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,370
How well do you know Big Mike?

308
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,000
In case you haven't noticed he doesn't have much to say.

309
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,600
What's the big deal? It's just for one night, right?

310
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,790
It is just one night, right? Leigh Anne?

311
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,950
You don't think he'll steal anything, do you?

312
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,960
I guess we'll know in the morning.

313
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,160
Well if you hear a scream call the insurence adjustor.

314
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,880
Mike?

315
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,950
Big Mike?!

316
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,660
Mike?

317
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,380
Big Mike!

318
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,350
You're gonna make me walk the whole way?

319
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,220
Alright then.

320
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,960
Where are you going?

321
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,680
Iono.

322
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,330
Well, are you spending thanksgiving with your family?

323
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
- Come and get it, childs! - Yeah, baby!

324
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,170
SJ
SJ!

325
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,820
Come on!

326
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,770
We have a ramble turkey.

327
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,312
Everyone thank your mother for driving

328
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:10,490
to the store and getting this.

329
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,130
- Thank you, mama. - Thank you, mama.

330
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,810
Limp football.

331
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,560
Eat all you want.

332
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,110
Come on.

333
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,740
Hustle, hustle! We got to get back to the game.

334
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,920
Oh yeah!

335
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,790
- Don't take my space. - You rush us, SJ.

336
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,140
- SJ, sit down. - Come on.

337
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,430
- No. - That's just fantastic.

338
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,150
Oh, y'all forget the potato salad!

339
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,630
- How's Ole Miss doing? - They're kicking butt.

340
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Sean, salad.

341
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,080
- Thanks, mom. - Oh, good. Thanks, mama.

342
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,630
Yeah, mama.

343
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,260
- Come on! - Come on!

344
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,410
He wants to be bet.

345
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,460
- Hey! Mom! - Whoa.

346
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,870
But it's thanksgiving.

347
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,760
- Why are we in here?  - Shhh!

348
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,860
Shall we say a grace?

349
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,347
Heavenly father. We thank you for all

350
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,550
the many blessings on this family.

351
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,350
We thank you for bringing us a new friend.

352
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,960
And we ask that you look after us in this holiday season

353
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,510
that we may never forget how very fortunate we are.

354
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,900
- Amen. - Amen.

355
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,640
- SJ, the score? - Up by ten.

356
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,790
Collins, can you pass me the green beans, please?

357
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,410
Don't pick it with your fingers just take a spoon. Okay.

358
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,900
- SJ! Elbows!  - Sorry.

359
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,200
So, Big Mike. You like to shop?

360
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,220
Because tomorrow I think I'll have to show you how it's done.

361
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,140
I got clothes.

362
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,440
You "have" clothes.

363
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,490
And an extra t-shirt in the plastic bag does not a wardrobe make.

364
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,150
I have clothes.

365
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,800
Fine, let's go get 'em. Just tell me where I'm going.

366
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,270
Alright. Tell me everything I need to know about you.

367
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,340
Who takes care of you? A mother?

368
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,280
Do you have any mother? A grandmother maybe?

369
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,320
Tell you what, Big Mike.

370
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,753
We can do this the easy way,

371
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:26,840
or we can do it the hard way.

372
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,690
You take a pick.

373
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,230
Fine.

374
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,171
Tell me just one thing I should know about you.

375
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,550
Just... just one.

376
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,300
I don't like to be called big Mike.

377
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,780
Okay.

378
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:52,070
Tell you what, from now on, to me, you're Michael. Okay?

379
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,540
So... Michael, where we headed?

380
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,300
Right?

381
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,160
Savi. Savi, give it to me...

382
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,910
She's just the ...

383
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,170
- Hey, B.J.  - Hey.

384
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,670
- That's nice - Yo. Check it.

385
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,590
- Yay. - S7.

386
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,020
- For real. - Yeah.

387
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,590
You like that?

388
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,450
Do you know 'em?

389
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,770
Man, I got no idea.

390
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,550
It's where your mother lives?

391
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,480
- Let's go get 'em. - No. Don't get out.

392
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,230
Who's going to help you carrying your clothes, Michael?

393
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,640
Don't get out of the car.

394
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,520
No way.

395
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,010
Oh, that's Big Mike, man.

396
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,490
Oh, Big Mike is in the house!

397
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,440
Big Mike! Where you been?!

398
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,430
And who's that fine thing that driving you around like Ms. Daisy?

399
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,100
Hey, Dave.

400
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,562
You need to let me buy you new snickers,

401
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:10,320
Man. I'll take care, you know.

402
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,780
I run this over here and the whole village, baby. Got it?

403
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,290
Look at that.

404
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,170
Hey. Hey, D. Watch this.

405
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,160
They always go for the wing. Watch this.

406
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,710
Dear snowflake.

407
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,630
You like that? Yeah.

408
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,870
She wasn't home.

409
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,600
Well, we can come back.

410
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,040
She prolly moved to a nicer place.

411
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,457
I've lived in Memphis my whole life

412
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,650
And never been anywhere near here.

413
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,200
You're going to take care of me, right?

414
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,050
I got your back.

415
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,610
Just follow me yo.

416
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,310
Here we go.

417
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,540
Oh, we also got a parole for the ladies.

418
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,700
But everything we got that'd fit him is right here.

419
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,320
This is it?

420
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,778
If this is all you got,

421
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,750
why's it say "big and tall" on the sign?

422
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,900
Big and tall. You need "bigger and taller."

423
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,670
- Howl, if you need me. - Thank you.

424
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,060
You see anything, you like?

425
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,760
Hey. I got a just what you're looking for.

426
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,990
Well, one thing I know about shopping is

427
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,563
That if you don't absolutely love

428
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:35,180
it in the store, you won't wear it.

429
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,510
The store is, where you like it best.

430
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,760
So before you choose something think of yourself wearing it

431
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,910
and say to yourself, is this me?

432
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,100
No.

433
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,050
What about this one?

434
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,170
This isn't atrocious.

435
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,140
Alright, well, you go look over there I go look over here.

436
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,270
Who would imagine this many clothes are plastic?

437
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,240
Good lord... what is this made of?

438
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,870
That's the one?  That's the one you like?

439
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,950
Alright then.

440
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,920
Have a great day. Learn something!

441
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,210
Don't get your panties in a wad.

442
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,027
The best part about Paris was the food.

443
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:02,310
They use sauce like we use gravy.

444
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,650
I had to join a gym the day I got back.

445
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,060
Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town?

446
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,945
Where exactly are you talking about?

447
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,540
Alabama Street... Hurt village.

448
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,490
Hurt village, that sounds like a threat.

449
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,860
You're not far off.

450
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,939
I think it might "hurt" me to go there.

451
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,920
It'd hurt your reputation to go there.

452
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,650
Well actually I'm from there but didn't mind hard work

453
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,170
And look where I am now.

454
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,820
Eating an eighteen dollar salad.

455
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,060
And it's a little soggy to be honest.

456
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,340
Leigh Anne? What is this sudden interest in the project?

457
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,930
Is this another one of your charities?

458
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,800
Wait. A project for the projects.

459
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,020
Oh, that's catchy. Money would raise itself.

460
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,590
Okay. Count me in, leigh anne.

461
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,900
Sj, you have two more minutes on that playbox thing, alright?

462
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,450
Oh, mom!

463
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,410
Michael, do you want to stay here?

464
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,900
Because... if you want to stay here... for awhile longer...

465
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,320
I can find some time to figure out a bedroom for you.

466
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,547
Because look at this, you've practically

467
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:18,960
ruined a ten thousand dollar coach.

468
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,230
You want to stay here, Michael?

469
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,910
I don't want to go anyplace else.

470
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,110
Well alright then.

471
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,100
SJ, you'd better be off that playbox.

472
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,640
That wasn't two minutes.

473
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,520
Good night Mrs. Tuohy.

474
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,840
I see on the admission that we're Michael's contact

475
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,310
for medical emergencies?

476
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,020
Sean wrote that in last week.

477
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,530
We needed contact number

478
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,720
and the ones listed weren't in service.

479
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,770
Sean. Love that man.

480
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,910
What's this?

481
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,479
The state makes schools measure for

482
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,180
career aptitude in eight grade.

483
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,180
And this just came with his file.

484
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,690
What does it say about Michael?

485
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,340
Spatial relations - third percentile.

486
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:21,870
Ability to learn - fifth percentile.

487
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,485
It's funny though. He tested in the

488
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:27,630
98th percentile in one category.

489
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,170
- Which one? - "Protective Instincts."

490
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,460
So over here we have a desk. Chest o'drawers.

491
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,990
You have a night stand, a light, and alarm.

492
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,219
Sean says all the pro athletes use futons

493
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,010
if they can't find a bed big enough.

494
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,650
So I got you one of those

495
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:48,638
'cause frame was heinous.

496
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,123
It's not about to let that in my house.

497
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,820
But I got you something nicer.

498
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,500
- It's mine?  - Yes, sir.

499
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,740
What?

500
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,820
Never had one before.

501
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,120
What? A room to yourself?

502
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,870
A bed.

503
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,640
Well, you have one now.

504
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,510
Okay. Define osmosis.

505
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,680
I think I know what.

506
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,470
It's when water passes through the barrier.

507
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,260
That's basically right, Michael. Very good.

508
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,710
Name the combatants in the battle of Waterloo.

509
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,810
I know that one. Umm...

510
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,210
The little guy, Napoleon... he was on one side and...

511
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,120
- ...and Duke's on the other. - Duke of Wellington.

512
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,410
Yeah. And the Duke of Wellington and Russia or something.

513
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,960
Prussians.

514
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,930
Enough with the rugby shirts.

515
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,980
You look like a giant bumble bee.

516
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,156
That Taco Bell, KFC catty corner,

517
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:55,000
the Long John Silver's on the next block...

518
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,304
You own all of 'em?

519
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:58,010
Yeah. We've got like hundreds.

520
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,330
Eighty five.

521
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,470
Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to go to work?

522
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,350
Ho! Ho! Hey! I'm working even when I'm not working.

523
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,700
What?

524
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,780
And y'all eat at those places for free?

525
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,910
All you want. It's awesome.

526
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,660
What do y'all do with the leftover food? From the restaurant?

527
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,329
Well, we have to throw some of it out,

528
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,450
what's already been cooked.

529
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,510
- That's too bad.  - Yeah. I'd rather sell it.

530
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,030
Seems like you could give it away or something?

531
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,970
- You should check into that, daddy.  - Alright, I will, SJ.

532
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,790
How come we ain't eatin' at one of your restaurants tonight?

533
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,740
Because tonight is a special occasion.

534
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,010
What?

535
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,897
I talked to coach Cotton and

536
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:37,510
He said that Michael's grades had improved enough

537
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,220
that he can go out for spring football in March.

538
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,400
Isn't that great?

539
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,450
Oh, man! You are gonna crush some people!

540
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,720
- Hey, guys. How you doin'?  - Great. Thank you.

541
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,768
I've got a design book I need to get.

542
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:58,320
Sean, go check on our reservation.

543
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,170
They're gonna seat us right away. Can't you wait after dinner.

544
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,520
Might be closed by then! Come on, SJ.

545
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,130
- Please. - I need some new magazines.

546
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,700
Michael, come on. Come on.

547
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,870
Collins! Collins!

548
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,670
Collins. Come on! Your dad's already pilled.

549
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,350
- Lets' go. Come on.  - Over here.

550
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,450
Remember this one, mom?

551
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,400
You read it to us like thousand times.

552
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,671
"And he gnashed his terrible teeth

553
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:45,740
and he roared his terrible roar."

554
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,930
I always liked this one.

555
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,560
Oh, Ferdinand... Me too.

556
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,170
Michael, your mama ever read either one of those books to you?

557
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
No?

558
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,330
It was a good steak.

559
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,110
- Thank you, daddy. - Thank you for lovely dinner, papa.

560
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,710
Here we go.

561
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,430
Michael?

562
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,750
Who was that boy you were talking to, at the restaurant?

563
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,300
Marcus.

564
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,860
Marcus. And he works there?

565
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,400
Yeah.

566
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,630
How do you know him?

567
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,830
He's my brother.

568
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,830
Well, we'd really like to meet him someday.

569
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,310
Would that be okay with you?

570
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,030
I don't know where he stays.

571
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,850
When's the last time you saw him?

572
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,810
When I was little maybe.

573
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,990
"Once upon a time in spain, there was a

574
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,110
little bull and his name was Ferdinand.

575
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,880
All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump

576
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,430
and butt their heads together,

577
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,430
but not ferdinand.

578
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,620
He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers.

579
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,000
He had a favorite spot out in the pasture under a cork tree.

580
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,770
It was his favorite tree

581
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:08,010
and he would sit in its shade all day and smell the flowers."

582
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,850
- Good night.  - Good night.

583
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,170
What?

584
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,570
Why are you smiling?

585
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,610
I don't know. I'm just happy. Really happy.

586
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,490
Does this happiness have anything to do with Michael?

587
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,040
No.

588
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,960
It has everything to do with Michael.

589
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,810
Happy's good.

590
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,730
You know what I think we should do?

591
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,720
We should start a charity for kids like Michael.

592
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,510
Okay.

593
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,100
- Maybe fund a program at Wingate. - Sure.

594
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,890
Lord knows that school could use a little color.

595
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,440
Michael's like a flying and milking that place.

596
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,910
Are you listening to me?

597
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,170
I try to concentrate on one... thing... at a time.

598
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,380
You knew I was multi-tasker when you married me, right?

599
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,780
- I sure did.  - Alright. Okay.

600
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,060
Okay. Tuohy family. Big smiles everyone!

601
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,690
And, one , two, three...

602
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,140
Michael! Michael come over here and get in the next one.

603
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,380
Come on. Come on. Come over here.

604
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,625
Oh, come on.

605
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:44,870
It's not like I'm gonna put it on the Christmas card.

606
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,060
Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.

607
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,850
That's good.

608
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,170
Really big smiles.

609
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,830
Okay, one, two three... Say rebels!

610
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,430
Rebels.

611
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,750
I got it.

612
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,120
- Who's winning? - Tennessee.

613
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,800
- Who are they playing? - Clemson.

614
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,340
Your mom roots against Tennessee no matter who they're playing?

615
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,190
Oh, yes, I do. With gusto.

616
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,380
She can't stand Tennessee.

617
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,640
Collie-bell, I thought you were going to your boyfriend's?

618
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,590
I thought of hanging around here today.

619
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,630
I like that.

620
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,753
Hey, baby. There's a couple of messages on the machine

621
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:34,650
but I didn't check 'em.

622
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,200
Alright.

623
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,770
Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne, it's cousin bobby. Happy new years!

624
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,820
Listen, I've had about five cold ones...

625
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,663
Of course you had.

626
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:46,570
I'm just gonna go ahead and ask.

627
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,970
You know there's a colored boy in your Christmas card?

628
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,250
What?

629
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,410
You just looked teeny-tiny next to him. Right?

630
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,700
Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.

631
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,510
Hey, does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell?

632
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,010
Because if he does Sean's gonna lose a few stores.

633
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,550
He's a great kid.

634
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,900
Well, I say make it official and just adopt him.

635
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,740
He's gonna be eighteen in a few months.

636
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:19,140
Doesn't really make much sense to legally adopt.

637
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,580
Leigh Anne, is this some sort of white guilt thing?

638
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,450
What will your daddy say?

639
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,410
Umm... before or after he turns over in his grave?

640
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,050
Daddy's been gone five years Elaine,

641
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,390
Make matters worse you wear at the funeral.

642
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,860
Remember? You wore Chanel and that awful black hat.

643
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,820
Look, here's the deal.

644
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,920
I don't need y'all to approve my choices, alright?

645
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,730
But I do ask you to respect them.

646
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,700
You've no idea what this boy's been through.

647
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,540
And if this is going to be some running diatribe

648
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,140
I can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home.

649
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,150
Leigh Anne, I'm so sorry. We didn't intend to...

650
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,760
No. We didn't really.

651
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,080
I think, what you're doing is so great...

652
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,840
to open up your home... to him.

653
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,340
Honey, you're changing that boy's life.

654
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,610
No.

655
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,590
He's changing mine.

656
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,040
That's awesome for you, but what about Collins?

657
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,140
What about Collins?

658
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,090
Aren't you worried, I mean, even just a little?

659
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,490
He's a boy, a large, black boy,

660
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,990
sleeping under the same roof.

661
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,080
Shame on you.

662
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,450
I've got this.

663
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,670
Be honest with me, okay?

664
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,400
Is Michael being here making you uncomfortable?

665
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,700
They're stupid kids, who cares what they say.

666
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,290
What kids?

667
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,710
At school.

668
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,040
They're juvenile.

669
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,840
And what do they juvenile kids say?

670
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,890
It's really not worth repeating.

671
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,320
And don't worry about SJ, he likes all the attention.

672
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,920
He introduces Michael as his big brother.

673
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,590
- What about you? - It's fine.

674
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,630
I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street.

675
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,180
I can make other arrangements.

676
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,270
- Hi, Mike.  - Hi.

677
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
- Need a push?  - Yeah.

678
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,510
Higher, Mike! Higher!

679
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,880
Higher!

680
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,330
Higher!

681
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,120
Don't look down. Don't look down!

682
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,340
- Where are you going?  - Collins?

683
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,960
Quit looking at me like that.

684
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,710
I mean, we study together at home.

685
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,916
You know how much those things weigh?

686
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,210
This kid's gonna make us all famous.

687
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,520
Easy, Bert, man. It's only the spring.

688
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,000
He hasn't even been through his first practice yet.

689
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,850
No. He's a player.

690
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,390
Ready.

691
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,980
Get down, son. Get down in your stands.

692
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,570
In your stands!

693
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,340
Go!

694
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,740
Mike! son!

695
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,240
You fall off the block and then you

696
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:46,750
wanna shuck-shuck the blocker.

697
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,690
Right? Shuck it! alright? Let's go!

698
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,120
How's he doing?

699
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,740
Doesn't quite have the hang of it yet.

700
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,860
Hey, Mike. Son...

701
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,440
Shuck the blocker. Don't hold him!

702
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:17,210
No! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no.

703
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,520
Balloons! There are balloons!

704
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,800
Guys, quit looking at the balloons. Everybody.

705
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,060
Most kids from bad situations can't wait to be violent

706
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,920
and that comes out on the field.

707
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,260
This kid, he acts like he doesn't want to hit anyone.

708
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,160
He's Ferdinand the Bull.

709
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,290
- What?  - Nothing.

710
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,150
I thought sure he was gonna be a player.

711
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,190
I can't believe I used up my chiefs to get him in school.

712
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,490
I thought you said it was your Christian duty?

713
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,180
Look, Bert. He's never played before.

714
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,510
And he won't this fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then.

715
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,690
Who dad made him Bert Bright?

716
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,120
Unbelievable!

717
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,470
Oh, God bless me.

718
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,560
This is your summer workout sheet.

719
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,760
Now, first it says to warm up and get loose.

720
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Go ahead, get loose.

721
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,910
Are you loose?

722
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,170
Okay, next is five one hundred yard runs

723
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:27,370
to stretch out your legs.

724
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,990
Let's go home, play some video games.

725
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,627
Look, everybody at Wingate is expecting

726
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,150
you to be a star football player.

727
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,890
You don't want to let them down, do you?

728
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,680
I don't know.

729
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,030
What about dad and mom?

730
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,010
'cause you see, in our family everyone's an athlete.

731
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,720
Dad was a basketball star,

732
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,070
Collins plays volleyball and runs track.

733
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,650
And me, as you know, I do it all.

734
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,350
And mom... mom was a cheerleader,

735
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,550
which doesn't exactly count but don't tell her I said that.

736
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,950
- Okay?  - Okay.

737
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,160
Okay.

738
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,330
...Fifty, fifty one,

739
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,800
Fifty two, fifty three...

740
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,470
Come on and get it! Go, go, go, go, go!

741
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,290
Come on. Five seconds left in the game!

742
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,060
Just like! Just like!

743
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,140
High knees, high knees, high knees! Baby.

744
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,940
Run like the wind!

745
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,250
Go, Michael, go!

746
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,690
...Ninety eight, nine,

747
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,810
One hundred.

748
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,890
Move your feet! Move your feet! Come on! Come on! Come on!

749
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,790
Go. There you go.

750
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,750
Get on the tackle! Come on! Come on! Come on!

751
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,320
Come on, Michael!

752
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,650
Mrs. Tuohy?

753
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,280
I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my shoulder for my mother-in-law.

754
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:11,780
Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else.

755
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,520
- Can you help me get something? - What?

756
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,710
Driver's licence.

757
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,253
Why do you need a driver's licence

758
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:27,280
When you don't even have a car?

759
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,850
Michael, why do you want a driver's licence?

760
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,000
Something to carry. With my name on it.

761
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,750
There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system.

762
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,100
Another last name perhaps?

763
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,300
Look, I will sign something that says he lives with us

764
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,470
And we'll pay for all the insurence;

765
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:00,950
whatever it takes, okay?

766
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,660
What's it gonna take?

767
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,510
- You wanna do what?! - You heard me.

768
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,463
Shouldn't we at least talk about this?

769
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:08,890
What do you think we're doing?

770
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,250
And don't act like I'm going behind your back.

771
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,357
I know you put us down as

772
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:15,030
Michael's medical contact at school.

773
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,170
There's a huge difference between paying for broken arm

774
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,110
And being legally responsible for someone.

775
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,110
I mean the kid we barely know.

776
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,655
That's another thing.

777
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:25,450
We need to find out more about his past.

778
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,515
He won't talk about it. He's like an onion,

779
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:29,580
You have to peel him back a layer at a time.

780
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,780
Not if you use a knife.

781
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,110
What if we took him to a child psychologist or something?

782
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,750
- Do you really expect Big Mike - "Michael"

783
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,440
You really expect Michael to lie down

784
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:42,170
On a couch and talk about his childhood

785
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,540
Like he's Woody Allen or something?

786
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,370
I mean, Michael's gift is his ability to forget.

787
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,454
He's mad at no one and he really

788
00:56:48,455 --> 00:56:50,870
Didn't care what happened in the past.

789
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,860
You're right.

790
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,550
Excuse me?

791
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,260
"You're right?"

792
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,950
How'd those words taste coming out of your mouth?

793
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,650
Like vinegar.

794
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,110
At least promise me you'll think about it.

795
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,660
Alright.

796
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,658
"Alright" you'll think about it or

797
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:18,050
"Alright" we should do it?

798
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,200
Is there a difference?

799
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,596
Just tell Gerald to hold on the

800
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:27,020
Chiffonier and I'll get by after while.

801
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,340
You don't... I got to call you back. Bye.

802
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,520
Excuse me.

803
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,705
I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.

804
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,450
Let me tell you something, alright?

805
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,590
We've been sitting around here for over an hour

806
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,400
And when I look around and all I see

807
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,080
Is people shooting the bull and drinking coffee.

808
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,130
Who runs this place?

809
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:52,848
Well, I'd have it in shape in two days,

810
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,250
I can tell you that.

811
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,330
I'd bet you would. How can I help you?

812
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,570
- Oh, he was first. - No, you go ahead.

813
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,040
- I think I want to hear this - Me too.

814
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,760
I do not appreciate the attitude.

815
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,760
Ma'am, now you can tell me what you want

816
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,230
Or I'll make sure you wait all day.

817
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,250
Now how can I help you?

818
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,340
I'd like to become a legal guardian.

819
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,440
Lord help that child.

820
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,868
There's very little on Michael.

821
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:22,380
Most of his files have been lost.

822
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,810
- What is in there?  - A few case notes.

823
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,616
This one describes an incident where

824
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:30,850
Officers forcibly removed Michael

825
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,730
From Denise Oher's care when Michael was seven.

826
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,590
Quite a scene evidently. They had to split up the kids.

827
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,110
And it's far from the worst.

828
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,220
Where is she? His mother?

829
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,865
I don't know, if you find her

830
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,720
Will got a bunch more files we could add to.

831
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,936
How many kids does she have?

832
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:49,140
At least a dozen, probably.

833
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,560
If not more. With her drug arrest record

834
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,260
My guess would be she can't even remember.

835
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,420
May I see that?

836
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,430
So we'd need her permission, right?

837
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,630
No. Michael is a ward of the state.

838
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,880
Just apply and get a judge to sign off on it.

839
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,919
So you would just give him away

840
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,140
Without even telling his mother?

841
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,170
Mrs. Oher?

842
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,110
Hi.

843
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,700
Mrs. Oher?

844
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,620
- You from the state? - No.

845
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,276
My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy

846
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:57,380
And your son Michael lives with me.

847
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,520
And my family.

848
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,900
How's my boy? How's big Mike?

849
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,040
He's fine. He's doing really well.

850
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,690
We might have some wine in the kitchen, if you...

851
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,040
Oh, no, no, no. That's really kind.

852
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,490
When did you last see Michael?

853
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,280
I don't know.

854
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,080
How many foster kids you got living with you?

855
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,564
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.

856
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:33,270
We were just helping him out.

857
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,990
- State don't pay you nothing? - No.

858
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,630
And you feed him? You buy him clothes, too?

859
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,340
Well, when I can find them in his size.

860
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,700
You a fine Christian lady.

861
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,640
Well I try to be.

862
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,270
This is all really nice what you're doing,

863
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,770
But don't be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone.

864
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,440
- What do you mean?  - He's a "runner."

865
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,950
That's what the state called him after they took him from me.

866
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,080
Every foster home they sent him to,

867
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,300
He'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me.

868
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,044
No matter where I was that boy would

869
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:21,290
Come find me, take care of me.

870
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,150
I've had some health problems.

871
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,210
Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a different name?

872
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,820
Proctor. That was his daddy's last name.

873
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,730
- Where is he?  - Ain't seen him since he left.

874
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,920
And when was that?

875
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,390
Week after was Mike born?

876
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,990
Do you have his birth certificate?

877
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,020
It's alright. I'll figure it out.

878
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,900
Mrs. Oher, you'll always be Michael's mama.

879
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,740
Would you like to see him?

880
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:25,630
No. Not this way.

881
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,400
It's Williams.

882
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,610
His last name's Williams.

883
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,830
Couldn't even remember who the boy's father is.

884
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,590
The color is better, the graphic is bright. It's awesome!

885
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,590
Michael, we have something we'd like to ask you.

886
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,540
What?

887
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,170
Leigh Anne and I, we...

888
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,300
We'd like to become your legal guardians.

889
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,800
What's that mean?

890
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:29,755
What it means is, that we want to know

891
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,750
If you'd like to become a part of this family?

892
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,170
I kinda thought I already was.

893
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,920
Well alright then.

894
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,630
Right here.

895
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,000
We got a couple of steps.

896
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,300
- Watch your big foot. - One more.

897
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,200
One more. There we go.

898
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,810
Alright. Take off the belt.

899
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,930
Well, that's the one you want it, didn't it?

900
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,604
Here. Here you go. Go ahead. Take it for a ride. Go.

901
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,720
- Can I go too? - Yeah.

902
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,680
Michael? Be careful.

903
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,710
Shotgun!

904
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,900
- He wanted a truck?! - Michael thinks he's a redneck.

905
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:44,630
Come on, Michael!

906
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,378
Okay. See, you're the ketchup,

907
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:49,560
Here at left tackle. On the weakside.

908
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,800
The first play is simple. "Gap."

909
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,635
Now, see, dishes means you're going

910
01:04:56,636 --> 01:04:58,740
To block whoever is in front of you,

911
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,597
Or on your inside shoulder

912
01:05:00,598 --> 01:05:02,060
If you're not covered by a defender.

913
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,062
Now, I'll be the running back and you

914
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:05,910
Show me what you're supposed to do.

915
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,460
Ready.... hike!

916
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,450
You block him, you hit him,

917
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,860
Quarterback will hand it off, he gets the ball and...

918
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,800
Open lane to the end zone. All there is to it.

919
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,700
What's going on here?!

920
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,636
Player spice just scored.

921
01:05:20,686 --> 01:05:22,035
We're going through the playbook.

922
01:05:22,036 --> 01:05:23,630
Michael got move to offense.

923
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,024
Yeah. Well, when you're done, please,

924
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:26,550
Put the players back in the spice cabinet.

925
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,450
- Thank you. - No problem.

926
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:32,420
Oh, actually, Mom, we were kinda waiting for you.

927
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,132
You see, the new madden game came out

928
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:37,390
And me and Michael wanted to go get it.

929
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:39,230
I can't, baby. I've got a meeting in ten minutes

930
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,730
But he can drive!

931
01:05:41,498 --> 01:05:43,191
He can drive us.

932
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:47,885
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

933
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,290
What do you know about this?

934
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,240
I already know all about this!

935
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,408
Alright, show me something.

936
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,620
I'll tell you something, alright?

937
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,890
I'll start it. Follow my leads.

938
01:05:55,095 --> 01:05:56,395
- Ready? - Yes.

939
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,550
# next days function, high class luncheon #

940
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,570
# food is served and you're stone cold munchin' #

941
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,380
# music comes on, people start to dance #

942
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,410
# but then you ate so much you nearly split your pants #

943
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,710
# A girl starts walkin, guys start gawkin' #

944
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,640
# Sits down next to you and starts talkin' #

945
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,570
# Says she wanna dance cus she likes the groove #

946
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,120
# So come on fatso and just bust a move #

947
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,640
# If you want it, you've got it #

948
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,680
# If you want it baby you got it #

949
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:25,040
# If you want it, you've got it #

950
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,710
# If you want it baby you got it #

951
01:06:33,133 --> 01:06:36,102
This is not a 40,000 dollar oushak, Omeed.

952
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,750
You're crazy, Leigh Anne!

953
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,091
The borders have different width. They've been altered.

954
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:43,902
We'll give you seventeen tops, alright?

955
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:45,671
Hello?

956
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:51,018
Hey, hey, Ma'am. Ma'am, you can't get in.

957
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:53,518
Those are my kids. Those are my kids!

958
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,340
Oh my God!

959
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,950
- It will be okay.  - Where are they?

960
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,450
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. Oh my God!

961
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,290
- Michael, you okay? - I'm fine. SJ!

962
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,890
- Michael, you're alright? - Go help SJ!

963
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,590
I'm so sorry, so sorry!

964
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,690
Excuse me, Ma'am?

965
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,200
SJ  SJ
SJ! SJ!

966
01:07:14,424 --> 01:07:16,017
- Mom? - Yes, baby?

967
01:07:16,218 --> 01:07:19,218
Do you think the blood will come out of my shirt?

968
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:23,155
Yes, I think the blood will come out of your shirt.

969
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,750
Ma'am, an airbag deploys at 200 miles an hour.

970
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,490
Your son's too small to sit in the front seat.

971
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,320
But he's okay, right?

972
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,890
Busted lip, bruised face.

973
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,950
Usually when someone his size gets the airbag

974
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,340
It's fractured faces, a broken neck.

975
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,600
Maybe worse.

976
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:40,154
Like the air bag was coming for him then changed direction.

977
01:07:40,284 --> 01:07:42,820
Quite defective or something like that.

978
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:44,870
Your son's very, very lucky.

979
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:48,280
No idea. I called the insurence. He's fine. He's fine!

980
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,300
I'll talk to you later. I got to go. Bye.

981
01:07:54,465 --> 01:07:56,408
SJ's fine.

982
01:07:57,468 --> 01:07:59,630
He is. He's actually enjoying all the

983
01:07:59,631 --> 01:08:01,618
Attention he's getting back there.

984
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,576
Hey, Michael. Could happen to anyone,

985
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:07,290
Alright? It's not your fault.

986
01:08:08,604 --> 01:08:10,205
Honey, look at me.

987
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,680
Michael, what happened to your arm?

988
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:22,142
I stopped it.

989
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:42,012
Let's go!

990
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,860
Oher! you've got a hundred pounds on Collis

991
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,210
And you can't keep him out of our backfield?

992
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:55,180
Hold your block until the whistle blow. Hold it!

993
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,740
Alright, let's go!

994
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:59,086
What's with the camera?

995
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,127
Michael always does better when he

996
01:09:01,128 --> 01:09:03,236
sees what he's supposed to be doing.

997
01:09:08,905 --> 01:09:12,308
- Holding ... left tackle. - Michael! Come on!

998
01:09:12,946 --> 01:09:15,596
Oher? Come here, Son.

999
01:09:17,163 --> 01:09:19,505
You got to hold it. Hold it inside here, between the tits.

1000
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:21,263
You got it?!

1001
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,119
Would you look at me, Son.

1002
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:25,024
If you grab 'em outside here like this

1003
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:27,026
without horse colour thing, you just did,

1004
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:30,252
We're going to get flagged and I'm gonna get pissed.

1005
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:31,036
You hear me?

1006
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:32,036
Alright, let's go!

1007
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:35,489
Baby, watch my stuff, alright?

1008
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,436
Okay.

1009
01:09:39,227 --> 01:09:41,972
Well at least he'll look good coming off the bus.

1010
01:09:42,022 --> 01:09:45,472
They'll be terrified 'til they realize he's a marshmallow.

1011
01:09:47,777 --> 01:09:50,513
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

1012
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:54,434
Gimme a minute, Bert.

1013
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:56,210
We're in the middle of practice, Leigh Anne!

1014
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,010
You can thank me later.

1015
01:09:58,806 --> 01:09:59,866
Come.

1016
01:10:00,566 --> 01:10:01,951
Michael,

1017
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:03,386
Do you remember when we first met

1018
01:10:03,436 --> 01:10:04,897
We went to that horrible part of

1019
01:10:04,898 --> 01:10:06,496
town to buy those dreadful clothes?

1020
01:10:06,546 --> 01:10:08,706
And I was a little bit scared and you told me not to worry about,

1021
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:10,646
Because you had my back. Do you remember that?

1022
01:10:10,696 --> 01:10:11,446
Yes, Ma'am.

1023
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:13,428
And if anyone tried to get to me,

1024
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:15,596
you would have stopped them, alright?

1025
01:10:15,696 --> 01:10:17,591
And when you and SJ were in that car wreck,

1026
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:19,791
What did you do to that airbag?

1027
01:10:20,526 --> 01:10:22,596
- I stopped it. - You stopped it.

1028
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:24,430
You stopped it.

1029
01:10:24,896 --> 01:10:26,746
This team is your family, Michael.

1030
01:10:26,796 --> 01:10:29,056
You have to protect them from those guys.

1031
01:10:29,106 --> 01:10:30,466
Okay? Listen.

1032
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:33,866
Okay.

1033
01:10:34,136 --> 01:10:35,967
Tony here is your quarterback, alright?

1034
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:37,236
You protect his blind side.

1035
01:10:37,286 --> 01:10:39,246
When you look at him, you think of me.

1036
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:41,876
How you had my back. How you have his.

1037
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:44,206
Okay? Alright. Tony, go back.

1038
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:47,395
Alright.

1039
01:10:47,936 --> 01:10:49,736
Oomaloompah here is your tailback.

1040
01:10:49,786 --> 01:10:51,486
When you look at him, you think of SJ,

1041
01:10:51,536 --> 01:10:53,543
How you never let anyone or anything to hurt him.

1042
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:55,093
You understand me?

1043
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:57,196
Alright. Go back.

1044
01:10:58,096 --> 01:11:00,759
- You got it? - What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?

1045
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:02,886
Fine. They can be on the team too.

1046
01:11:02,936 --> 01:11:05,586
Are you gonna protect the family, Michael?

1047
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:06,676
Yes, Ma'am.

1048
01:11:06,726 --> 01:11:08,926
Good boy. Now, go have some fun.

1049
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:18,398
Yelling at him doesn't work, Bert. Doesn't trust men.

1050
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:21,165
In his experience they pretend to care about 'til

1051
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,335
they disappear.

1052
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:30,646
Wanna little play?

1053
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:35,541
SJ, you're gonna wanna get this.

1054
01:11:35,746 --> 01:11:36,786
Okay.

1055
01:11:39,246 --> 01:11:40,666
Come on, Mike!

1056
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,826
Alright. Michael! come on!

1057
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,786
- Yes! Michael! - Alright! Way to go!

1058
01:12:19,426 --> 01:12:20,626
Yes!

1059
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,546
Good boy.

1060
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,556
Okay. What'd you say to him?

1061
01:12:40,126 --> 01:12:42,566
Should get to know your players, Bert.

1062
01:12:42,616 --> 01:12:46,256
He tested 98 percent in protective instincts.

1063
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,908
I said you could thank me later.

1064
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,616
It's later, Bert.

1065
01:13:05,809 --> 01:13:08,235
So much for home field advantage.

1066
01:13:08,356 --> 01:13:10,846
You ever seen so many rednecks in one place?

1067
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:13,116
Nascar, not even close.

1068
01:13:16,026 --> 01:13:19,226
Crusaders! Get ready for forty eight minutes of hell!

1069
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,106
You have fat ass.

1070
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:24,586
Hey, back on the field.

1071
01:13:24,636 --> 01:13:26,576
Let me go. Hold on. Listen up! Listen up!

1072
01:13:26,626 --> 01:13:29,926
Don't let 'em get inside your head. Now, keep your focus.

1073
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:31,066
- You ready? - "Yeah"

1074
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:33,016
- Alright. Let's go! - "Go"

1075
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:38,556
- Come on! - Michael!

1076
01:13:39,726 --> 01:13:41,316
Damn, that ain't fair!

1077
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,586
They got big ole' black bear playing for 'em!

1078
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:45,886
- What is this, a circus? - Right.

1079
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:48,999
Eyes forward, SJ! Sticks and stones.

1080
01:13:49,156 --> 01:13:51,286
Sticks and stones! Come on!

1081
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,676
- Alright!  - Alright! Good start!

1082
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:20,906
Let's go o! let's go!

1083
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:24,606
Here we go. Look at this big bull we got right here.

1084
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,346
Coming after you! Coming after you!

1085
01:14:27,766 --> 01:14:29,656
All night. All night.

1086
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:42,296
Don't let him get through, Oher! Come on, Son!

1087
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:47,196
Boy! All night long, fat ass! all night long!

1088
01:14:47,346 --> 01:14:50,026
I got you, boy. All night long!

1089
01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:53,632
That's my boy!

1090
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:56,286
- it's alright, Michael! - It's alright. Come on!

1091
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:58,636
- Let's go! - Take it off. Come on!

1092
01:15:01,174 --> 01:15:04,702
Here we go! Round two, baby! Round two!

1093
01:15:09,556 --> 01:15:12,456
- Switch! Switch! - Get it! Get it! Get it! go!

1094
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:22,996
Oher, don't let them get the inside gap zone!

1095
01:15:23,046 --> 01:15:24,503
Come on! Use your head!

1096
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:26,446
What is Bert doing? Nothing.

1097
01:15:29,186 --> 01:15:31,436
Hey, fat boy. We're not done yet.

1098
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:34,236
All game long, boy! All game long!

1099
01:15:34,456 --> 01:15:35,906
Alright. Alright.

1100
01:15:37,536 --> 01:15:38,676
Go!

1101
01:15:40,296 --> 01:15:41,956
Pass! Pass! Pass!

1102
01:15:43,286 --> 01:15:44,696
Stop! Oh!

1103
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:50,296
Why another pass, Bert?

1104
01:15:50,436 --> 01:15:52,516
Hey! Where you going, fat boy?

1105
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:54,046
Better stay out of my field.

1106
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:56,846
You are not welcome here! This is my field!

1107
01:15:56,896 --> 01:15:59,140
Sixty six, get beck to your own bank.

1108
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,759
Bert! Be quiet! Bert!

1109
01:16:10,796 --> 01:16:11,876
Hello?

1110
01:16:11,926 --> 01:16:15,216
Enough with the trick plays, Bert. Run the dang ball.

1111
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:20,069
You heard it. Run the dang ball. Run it.

1112
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:23,106
Wait a minute, did he just hanged up the phone?

1113
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:26,556
- No, I think he lost service. - He did not lose service.

1114
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:30,146
That's my boy, Jimmy! number 66!

1115
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:32,606
Kicking that blue guy's ass.

1116
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:36,316
Hey crotch mouth!

1117
01:16:36,976 --> 01:16:38,036
Yeah, you!

1118
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:40,916
Zip it or I'll come up there zip it for ya!

1119
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,116
Sticks and stones?

1120
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,626
You know what, SJ? Just turn forward.

1121
01:16:47,676 --> 01:16:50,626
Just take up the camera and keep shoot. Come on.

1122
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,416
Lock it!

1123
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:09,426
It's alright. Alright. Alright. We come back.

1124
01:17:28,386 --> 01:17:29,136
Go!

1125
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:35,436
Come on! Get him!

1126
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:37,436
Gone. He's gone.

1127
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:49,158
Unbelievable. Three plays. Three plays.

1128
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:51,046
Where were we... 4.3?

1129
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:52,356
Come on.

1130
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:00,136
Baby, me and you. Me and you, baby. One more time.

1131
01:18:00,186 --> 01:18:01,463
Here we go!

1132
01:18:17,546 --> 01:18:20,496
Alright, we got to cut back! We got to cut back!

1133
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:21,996
Come on. Let's go!

1134
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:23,696
Black piece of crap!

1135
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:27,486
Raf! Are you gonna do something about this?!

1136
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,536
He just kicked my boy in the head and cussed him!

1137
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:32,336
Thank you!

1138
01:18:32,706 --> 01:18:36,156
Unsportsmanlike conduct... wingate! Fifteen yards!

1139
01:18:36,206 --> 01:18:37,006
What?!

1140
01:18:37,056 --> 01:18:39,806
You shut up, or you'll get another fifteen.

1141
01:18:42,476 --> 01:18:45,606
This young man plays for my team. My team!

1142
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:49,016
And I will defend him like he's my own son.

1143
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:53,066
Against you or any other redneck son of a bitch!

1144
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:57,396
Don't worry, coach. I got your back.

1145
01:18:58,306 --> 01:18:59,586
Alright then.

1146
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:09,486
Come here, Son. Come here.

1147
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:11,223
Try "gap."

1148
01:19:11,466 --> 01:19:12,866
- "Gap?" - "Gap."

1149
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:17,488
Alright, gun rip, 47 gap, on and on.

1150
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:18,296
Ready?

1151
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:27,066
Coach ain't here to protect you now, is he?

1152
01:19:34,226 --> 01:19:35,866
Ready!

1153
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:39,326
Team is your family, Michael.

1154
01:19:45,366 --> 01:19:46,286
Go!

1155
01:19:52,306 --> 01:19:54,506
Go back, go back! Block them all!

1156
01:19:54,896 --> 01:19:57,156
We got to hold! We got to hold!

1157
01:19:57,866 --> 01:19:59,366
Oh god!

1158
01:20:00,756 --> 01:20:02,476
- Run, Michael! - SJ!

1159
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,286
- Michael! - Run, Michael! Run!

1160
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:05,436
Go!

1161
01:20:09,296 --> 01:20:11,336
- Go, Mike! - Go, Michael.

1162
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:15,356
Touchdown!

1163
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:26,016
Yo! Deliverance! You see number 74?

1164
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:28,176
Well, that's my son.

1165
01:20:29,636 --> 01:20:32,596
Way to go big bro!

1166
01:20:32,646 --> 01:20:33,916
- Dead ball foul. - Now what?!

1167
01:20:33,966 --> 01:20:35,896
- Was he holding! - No.

1168
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:39,486
- Did he hit after the whistle? - I don't believe so.

1169
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:42,056
So what is the flag for?

1170
01:20:42,226 --> 01:20:44,546
I dunno... excessive blocking.

1171
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:47,796
You're kidding me.

1172
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:53,646
Sorry, coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle.

1173
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,126
Where were you taking him, Mike?

1174
01:20:56,176 --> 01:20:59,296
To the bus. That was the time for him to go home.

1175
01:21:01,716 --> 01:21:04,812
Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy! Go get 'em.

1176
01:21:04,813 --> 01:21:06,396
Go get 'em, Crusaders!

1177
01:21:54,506 --> 01:21:58,016
Rub the heads! Rub the heads! Alright! Let's go!

1178
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:04,426
Go!

1179
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:07,446
Stay!

1180
01:22:26,586 --> 01:22:29,416
Red, 41! Red, 41!

1181
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:56,506
Tom Lemming recruiting, please hold...

1182
01:22:56,686 --> 01:22:58,926
Tom Lemming recruiting, please hold....

1183
01:22:58,976 --> 01:23:02,326
Coach Saban wants his monthly recruitment update fedex.

1184
01:23:02,486 --> 01:23:04,527
Does he really think getting it one

1185
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:06,686
day early is gonna give LSU a leg up?

1186
01:23:07,486 --> 01:23:10,256
Hey, have you filled all the slots for the army all star game?

1187
01:23:10,306 --> 01:23:11,476
Yeah, why?

1188
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,831
You might want to open one up.

1189
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:53,956
What did I tell you?

1190
01:24:02,936 --> 01:24:04,836
I want him. I want him bad.

1191
01:24:05,986 --> 01:24:10,616
Y-e-l-l! Everybody yell! Say, everybody yell!

1192
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:14,416
Y-e-l-l! Everybody yell!

1193
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:17,206
Nice kick this time, Collins. Nice job.

1194
01:24:17,926 --> 01:24:19,916
What in the world?

1195
01:24:20,186 --> 01:24:23,106
Alright. Y'all keep practicing. Remember point your toes.

1196
01:24:23,156 --> 01:24:24,806
One, two, three, one!

1197
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:26,826
One, two, three, two!

1198
01:24:26,876 --> 01:24:28,616
One, two, three, three!

1199
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:30,736
You okay, Son?

1200
01:24:33,296 --> 01:24:36,396
Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might as well go home.

1201
01:24:36,486 --> 01:24:39,186
What to say, fellas? How's doing your life?

1202
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:42,466
I came all the way from Knoxville, to see for myself.

1203
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:45,366
Hey, Coach. We drove from Clemson, nine hours!

1204
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:47,596
Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.

1205
01:24:47,646 --> 01:24:48,982
Coach Cotton, my pleasure.

1206
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,356
I watched your program. You've done really well.

1207
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:51,853
I don't think there is any question

1208
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:53,426
that you'll be at the next level soon.

1209
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:56,576
Oh, well, you know, we do all we can, all we got.

1210
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:00,126
Is that Michael? Is that O'hair?

1211
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:01,616
It's Oher.

1212
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:03,956
Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.

1213
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:10,436
You think we might see some drills?

1214
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,516
Perhaps... I think all the coaches would appreciate it.

1215
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:14,716
- Yeah? - Oh, yes, Sir. You bet.

1216
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:19,586
Listen up, fellas! New board drill!

1217
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:21,616
Big Mike, Jay Collis.

1218
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:22,426
Best on best. Right here.

1219
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:24,426
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

1220
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,726
On my whistle, men!

1221
01:26:01,786 --> 01:26:03,056
Coach, thank you.

1222
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:05,846
- Where are you going, coach? - Back to South Carolina.

1223
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:09,106
You tell to Michael Oher, if he can qualify with his grades...

1224
01:26:09,156 --> 01:26:10,246
Clemson wants him.

1225
01:26:10,296 --> 01:26:12,496
Yeah. Good luck with that, Brad!

1226
01:26:13,046 --> 01:26:15,136
Coach, you've done a great job with this young man.

1227
01:26:15,186 --> 01:26:16,936
Oh, well he was little rough when we first got him

1228
01:26:16,986 --> 01:26:19,886
But we, you know, coached him up a little bit.

1229
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:31,856
Hello, Mom.

1230
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:34,456
Did you know that to be eligible for a division one scholarship

1231
01:26:34,506 --> 01:26:37,496
Michael's gonna need to make it a 2.5 gpa?

1232
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:38,956
Really?

1233
01:26:39,006 --> 01:26:41,306
His ACT is low and I don't see him doing

1234
01:26:41,307 --> 01:26:43,606
Any better if he retakes it right there.

1235
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:47,086
- What's his gpa now?  - 1.76.

1236
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:50,015
Oh, that's not too bad, when you consider where he started.

1237
01:26:50,065 --> 01:26:52,515
He's gonna make it all A's this year.

1238
01:26:53,106 --> 01:26:56,466
I'm serious. And that might not even be enough.

1239
01:26:56,826 --> 01:26:58,876
So he goes to junior college?

1240
01:26:59,356 --> 01:27:01,976
Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in the first year.

1241
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,406
His shot at the pros would go out the window.

1242
01:27:04,456 --> 01:27:05,382
Pros?

1243
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:07,896
Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers?

1244
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:13,121
Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.

1245
01:27:13,171 --> 01:27:15,957
I'm looking forward to you're coming down and visit us sometime.

1246
01:27:16,007 --> 01:27:18,418
Gready. I'm Lou Holtz form South Carolina.

1247
01:27:18,419 --> 01:27:19,076
I'm call...

1248
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:21,415
We're very interested in having Michael

1249
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,176
Over to Knoxville for a visit.

1250
01:27:23,836 --> 01:27:25,837
Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?

1251
01:27:25,838 --> 01:27:26,968
There's twenty more among there.

1252
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:29,668
And these things right here. Fifty of 'em.

1253
01:27:29,806 --> 01:27:31,086
Any of those from Ole Miss?

1254
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:32,894
No, they're not gonna start recruiting

1255
01:27:32,895 --> 01:27:34,376
Until they hire a another coach.

1256
01:27:34,426 --> 01:27:37,826
Does make any difference unless Michael makes his grades.

1257
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:42,306
So, what are we going to do?

1258
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:46,396
I understand you applied for a teaching position at Wingate?

1259
01:27:47,226 --> 01:27:49,476
I won't religious enough for 'em.

1260
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:52,152
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,

1261
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:55,196
but I have certain, shall we say... doubts.

1262
01:27:56,316 --> 01:27:58,706
Oh, I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.

1263
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,418
What's the situation with Michael?

1264
01:28:00,419 --> 01:28:01,988
He needs to be better in school.

1265
01:28:02,038 --> 01:28:04,193
Obviously. Why the big push?

1266
01:28:04,506 --> 01:28:06,586
Well, he's in line for football scholarship

1267
01:28:06,636 --> 01:28:08,526
If he gets his grades up.

1268
01:28:08,894 --> 01:28:11,183
Is he considering Ole Miss?

1269
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:11,794
He'd better be.

1270
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:17,146
- I'd love to work with him. - Well, when'd you like to start?

1271
01:28:18,366 --> 01:28:22,123
Mrs. Tuohy... umm... there's something you should know about me.

1272
01:28:22,446 --> 01:28:24,142
I don't usually tell many people, but

1273
01:28:24,143 --> 01:28:25,976
It's something you feel should be aware of

1274
01:28:26,026 --> 01:28:27,576
Before you hire me.

1275
01:28:29,786 --> 01:28:31,336
What is it?

1276
01:28:31,676 --> 01:28:33,476
I'm a democrat.

1277
01:28:35,286 --> 01:28:36,776
Okay.

1278
01:28:42,219 --> 01:28:44,478
- I don't understand it. - Yet.

1279
01:28:44,776 --> 01:28:46,776
You don't understand it yet.

1280
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:51,546
- how big is your head, Michael? - Big.

1281
01:28:52,396 --> 01:28:53,896
And what's in there?

1282
01:28:53,946 --> 01:28:55,446
- A brain. - A brain.

1283
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,166
It's full of knowledge

1284
01:28:57,216 --> 01:28:59,316
Like a file cabinet with maps;

1285
01:28:59,996 --> 01:29:02,496
And shortcuts for figuring things out.

1286
01:29:02,706 --> 01:29:04,476
You'll get there, Michael Oher

1287
01:29:04,526 --> 01:29:06,196
Because I'm to help you use those

1288
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:07,816
maps and reach your destination.

1289
01:29:07,866 --> 01:29:10,376
Like Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.

1290
01:29:10,686 --> 01:29:11,876
Sacagawea?

1291
01:29:12,076 --> 01:29:15,376
We'll get to that. And the history books have it wrong,

1292
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:18,766
All you need to know is I'll get you there.

1293
01:29:19,866 --> 01:29:21,656
Do you believe me?

1294
01:29:24,476 --> 01:29:26,416
You trust me, Michael?

1295
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:29,836
Yes, Miss Sue.

1296
01:29:32,316 --> 01:29:33,786
Try it again.

1297
01:29:35,126 --> 01:29:37,166
Now, what's the next one? Read that to me.

1298
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:40,566
Hey, what is it? As first, we have to find the constant.

1299
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:42,946
Now, where is the constant?

1300
01:29:43,136 --> 01:29:45,256
Good. See?

1301
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:49,156
Who'd thought we'd have a black son before we knew a democrat.

1302
01:29:50,704 --> 01:29:53,731
- Doorbell! - I got a guest.

1303
01:29:56,696 --> 01:29:58,166
Coach, how are you? Come in.

1304
01:29:58,216 --> 01:29:59,576
- Sean Tuohy. - Sean.

1305
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:01,516
- Nick Saban. Nice to meet you. - Nice to see you. Pleasure.

1306
01:30:01,566 --> 01:30:04,276
I appreciate the opportunity to come in your home.

1307
01:30:04,326 --> 01:30:06,626
- That's my daughter, Collins. - Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

1308
01:30:06,676 --> 01:30:09,586
- and you must be Leigh Anne. - that would be me, Coach Saban.

1309
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:11,256
- nice to meet you. - me too.

1310
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:12,366
Please, call me Nick.

1311
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:16,116
With an incredible home. The windsor valances are a nice touch.

1312
01:30:16,546 --> 01:30:20,525
Oh, thank you. You obviously have an excellent taste.

1313
01:30:20,566 --> 01:30:24,526
Well we appreciate the quality. And recognize it when we see it.

1314
01:30:26,096 --> 01:30:28,026
Michael, why don't you come over here and say hello to Coach Saban.

1315
01:30:28,066 --> 01:30:29,626
Hello, Michael. Nick Saban.

1316
01:30:29,676 --> 01:30:31,206
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1317
01:30:31,256 --> 01:30:33,506
- And you must be sj. - That's me.

1318
01:30:33,576 --> 01:30:37,326
Michael, why don't you and Nick go into the living room to talk?

1319
01:30:37,406 --> 01:30:38,406
Can SJ come?

1320
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:40,676
Absolutely. We'll recruit the both of you.

1321
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:42,106
Alright.

1322
01:30:44,636 --> 01:30:46,736
I find him extremely handsome.

1323
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:48,816
Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.

1324
01:30:48,866 --> 01:30:50,226
Yeah, I know.

1325
01:30:50,816 --> 01:30:53,746
So Michael, we'd like to get you down to LSU for visit.

1326
01:30:53,796 --> 01:30:55,986
We've got a great thing going there right now,

1327
01:30:56,036 --> 01:30:59,546
You have an opportunity to be successful as a person, as a student

1328
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:01,700
And an opportunity to be a part of

1329
01:31:01,701 --> 01:31:04,026
The next national championship team with LSU.

1330
01:31:04,076 --> 01:31:07,146
So what do you say? You'd like to commit to a visit?

1331
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:09,116
- Can I ask a question?  - Sure.

1332
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:11,226
My brother and I are very close.

1333
01:31:11,276 --> 01:31:15,146
And so... I'm very afraid that if he goes off to school,

1334
01:31:15,616 --> 01:31:17,566
I might not get to see him.

1335
01:31:17,624 --> 01:31:19,133
- So ... - Go on.

1336
01:31:19,456 --> 01:31:23,326
I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him.

1337
01:31:23,606 --> 01:31:26,036
Well, SJ, you'd have total access to Michael.

1338
01:31:26,086 --> 01:31:29,406
But better than that, in his first game at tiger stadium,

1339
01:31:29,456 --> 01:31:32,286
We would like for you to lead the team out of the tunnel.

1340
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:35,186
- What do you think about that? - Sounds good.

1341
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:50,656
Come on in!

1342
01:31:50,716 --> 01:31:53,985
Gready. I'm Lou Holtz. The university of South Carolina.

1343
01:31:54,035 --> 01:31:56,586
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you. Come and in.

1344
01:31:56,586 --> 01:31:56,986
Michael!

1345
01:31:57,036 --> 01:31:59,309
Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville. Albany university.

1346
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:01,646
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you. Michael!

1347
01:32:01,696 --> 01:32:03,647
Howdy, houston nutt. University of Arkansas.

1348
01:32:03,697 --> 01:32:05,316
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Very nice to meet you.

1349
01:32:05,366 --> 01:32:08,026
- Ole Miss cup, huh? - Michael!

1350
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:12,171
Oh, come on. You know this.

1351
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:13,976
It's logical.

1352
01:32:25,596 --> 01:32:28,236
I guarantee you come to the university of South Carolina

1353
01:32:28,286 --> 01:32:30,606
Will be the smartest decision you've ever made.

1354
01:32:30,656 --> 01:32:33,056
We want you, we need you, but the other thing is,

1355
01:32:33,106 --> 01:32:34,606
Mike, you need us.

1356
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,336
Knoxville is a tremendous place to live and...

1357
01:32:42,646 --> 01:32:45,496
I know there's lions, there's tigers, there's bears...

1358
01:32:45,546 --> 01:32:47,776
Hey, there's only one razorback in the world.

1359
01:32:47,826 --> 01:32:51,726
...and not only that, you'd look great in gamecock red!

1360
01:32:51,926 --> 01:32:53,076
What's in if for me?

1361
01:32:53,126 --> 01:32:56,706
Sj, I'd get you a hawkhat, and for whole family a hawkhat.

1362
01:32:56,756 --> 01:32:59,226
Are you telling me, that's the best you can do?

1363
01:32:59,276 --> 01:33:01,566
SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.

1364
01:33:01,846 --> 01:33:03,796
Coach, help me, help you.

1365
01:33:03,926 --> 01:33:07,826
I can get you a gamecock headdress. And with real feathers.

1366
01:33:16,476 --> 01:33:17,916
What you got for me, Phil?

1367
01:33:17,966 --> 01:33:20,806
SJ, I've been thinking a lot of about that and one of the things

1368
01:33:20,856 --> 01:33:22,643
That think will be special for both

1369
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:24,176
of us is we'll walk arm in arm

1370
01:33:24,226 --> 01:33:26,696
To center of union stadium at the first ball game,

1371
01:33:26,746 --> 01:33:28,626
And we'll do the coin toss together.

1372
01:33:28,676 --> 01:33:29,656
How's that sound?

1373
01:33:29,706 --> 01:33:32,037
Coach Fulmer, a pleasure doing a business with you

1374
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:34,987
My pleasure, SJ. Could be sure, buddy.

1375
01:33:45,306 --> 01:33:47,116
Congratulations on gettin' hired.

1376
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,866
Thank yew, ma'am. Ole miss is my dream job.

1377
01:33:50,486 --> 01:33:53,236
You're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard rebels

1378
01:33:53,286 --> 01:33:55,256
So I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map.

1379
01:33:55,306 --> 01:33:56,576
- Alright? - Got it.

1380
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:59,826
LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the nfl.

1381
01:34:00,016 --> 01:34:01,309
I don't wanna name names,

1382
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,806
but on Michael's first two recruitment trips

1383
01:34:02,856 --> 01:34:04,366
Somebody took him to the titty bar.

1384
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,276
- That's terrible.  - Tell me about it.

1385
01:34:06,326 --> 01:34:07,766
He'll have nightmares about for a weeks.

1386
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:08,666
So when he comes to visit

1387
01:34:08,716 --> 01:34:11,296
I want you to feed him Italian. He likes fettucine alfredo

1388
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:14,796
And I want you to take him to a movie - not chainsaw massacre

1389
01:34:14,846 --> 01:34:18,256
Because he'll just cover his eyes - and get him to bed by ten.

1390
01:34:18,306 --> 01:34:19,466
- You got it?  - Yes'm.

1391
01:34:19,516 --> 01:34:21,766
- Alright. - What about Tennessee?

1392
01:34:22,486 --> 01:34:25,026
It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt.

1393
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,966
Fulmer made sj a sweet deal.

1394
01:34:27,016 --> 01:34:29,766
I heard the kid can really pepper the gumbo.

1395
01:34:29,826 --> 01:34:31,496
He's his daddy's boy.

1396
01:34:31,836 --> 01:34:33,236
- You ready?  - Lets' do it.

1397
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:34,437
Alright.

1398
01:34:34,596 --> 01:34:36,926
Mike, do you like to barbecue? I tell you what, mike.

1399
01:34:36,976 --> 01:34:39,426
You can go to the gas station and get best barbecue,

1400
01:34:39,476 --> 01:34:40,966
You've ever got in your life.

1401
01:34:41,016 --> 01:34:43,656
It's a wonderful place to live, fried catfishes,

1402
01:34:43,706 --> 01:34:45,356
All the good food that we love to eat

1403
01:34:45,406 --> 01:34:46,896
But it's not good for us as football players,

1404
01:34:46,946 --> 01:34:49,276
You'd have to be aware, mike. I promise.

1405
01:34:49,326 --> 01:34:51,826
And for you, SJ, this is what I can do.

1406
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:54,036
At ole miss we have the grove by the stadium.

1407
01:34:54,086 --> 01:34:57,576
We walk it before every game, in front of thousands of people.

1408
01:34:57,626 --> 01:35:00,088
It is a sacrad ritual. And I'm in front.

1409
01:35:00,138 --> 01:35:02,181
Seen it a thousand times.

1410
01:35:02,276 --> 01:35:03,925
Ever seen it from the front of the line?

1411
01:35:03,975 --> 01:35:05,816
Next year, you and me; leading the team.

1412
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:09,566
Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin.

1413
01:35:13,016 --> 01:35:15,436
I'll throw in a sideline pass.

1414
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:27,466
Have you decided yet, Michael?

1415
01:35:27,526 --> 01:35:29,256
No, Miss Sue.

1416
01:35:30,206 --> 01:35:32,576
But you like Tennessee?

1417
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:35,430
It's a good school.

1418
01:35:35,956 --> 01:35:37,706
Not at academic level of ole miss,

1419
01:35:37,756 --> 01:35:40,706
But they have an outstanding science department.

1420
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:44,186
You know what they're famous for?

1421
01:35:44,716 --> 01:35:46,716
They work with the fbi

1422
01:35:47,046 --> 01:35:50,666
To study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts.

1423
01:35:51,216 --> 01:35:52,666
What's that mean?

1424
01:35:53,026 --> 01:35:54,738
Well when they find a body,

1425
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:56,406
the police want to know how long it's been dead.

1426
01:35:56,456 --> 01:35:59,396
So the fine fox at Tennessee help them out.

1427
01:36:00,486 --> 01:36:02,586
They have a lot of body parts.

1428
01:36:03,386 --> 01:36:09,566
Arms and legs and hands - form hospitals and medical schools.

1429
01:36:12,996 --> 01:36:15,346
And you know where they store them?

1430
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:21,206
Right underneath the football field.

1431
01:36:23,126 --> 01:36:26,054
So, while it's fine and dandy,

1432
01:36:26,055 --> 01:36:27,426
there're 100,000 fans cheering for you,

1433
01:36:27,806 --> 01:36:29,742
The bodies, you should be worried about are right underneath the turf

1434
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,380
Set to poke up through the ground and grab you.

1435
01:36:40,536 --> 01:36:43,526
But it's your decision where you wanna play ball.

1436
01:36:43,576 --> 01:36:45,526
Don't let me influence you.

1437
01:37:14,656 --> 01:37:16,237
All the other teachers are on board,

1438
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:17,776
I don't know, what your problem is.

1439
01:37:17,826 --> 01:37:18,806
I'm sorry.

1440
01:37:18,856 --> 01:37:22,096
I will not give a student a grade he, or she, doesn't deserve.

1441
01:37:22,146 --> 01:37:24,866
Well, Michael needs a b.

1442
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:28,616
What is he have to do to "deserve" that?

1443
01:37:29,936 --> 01:37:33,126
Right now is Michael doing c minus, d plus work.

1444
01:37:33,436 --> 01:37:35,766
His best chance at improving is with the written essay

1445
01:37:35,816 --> 01:37:37,266
At the end of the year.

1446
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:39,706
It counts a third of his grade.

1447
01:37:40,816 --> 01:37:42,796
Well that's it. We're sunk.

1448
01:37:44,594 --> 01:37:47,605
Why don't you write about "Great Expectations"?

1449
01:37:47,866 --> 01:37:49,726
You're a lot like Pip.

1450
01:37:49,926 --> 01:37:52,762
I mean he was poor, he was an orphan

1451
01:37:52,763 --> 01:37:55,126
and someone kind of found him.

1452
01:37:55,366 --> 01:37:57,816
You should be able to relate to that.

1453
01:38:01,576 --> 01:38:04,496
Fine, let's go through the reading list.

1454
01:38:04,596 --> 01:38:07,346
But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael.

1455
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:09,216
"Pygmalion"...

1456
01:38:12,406 --> 01:38:16,246
"A tale of two cities"..... "The charge of the light brigade"...

1457
01:38:16,296 --> 01:38:19,446
"half a league, half a league, half a league onward"

1458
01:38:19,996 --> 01:38:21,676
I love that one.

1459
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,586
He loves it.

1460
01:38:25,946 --> 01:38:29,106
Why don't you do this and I'll watch basketball?

1461
01:38:33,146 --> 01:38:34,496
Okay.

1462
01:38:38,146 --> 01:38:41,196
"all in the valley of death rode the six hundred."

1463
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:46,756
They named LSU's stadium death valley because of this story.

1464
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:50,086
Alfred, lord tennyson has writing about

1465
01:38:50,086 --> 01:38:51,086
LSU in Ole Miss.

1466
01:38:51,256 --> 01:38:53,876
- You're kidding? - No. It's a great story.

1467
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:55,426
It's a poem.

1468
01:38:56,316 --> 01:38:58,336
"forward the light brigade!"

1469
01:38:58,543 --> 01:39:00,156
It's like the offense.

1470
01:39:00,206 --> 01:39:02,386
"charge for the guns he said."

1471
01:39:02,626 --> 01:39:04,226
That's the end zone.

1472
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:06,793
"into the valley of death rode the six hundred."

1473
01:39:06,843 --> 01:39:08,793
"forward the light brigade!

1474
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:11,146
Was there a man dismay'd?

1475
01:39:11,346 --> 01:39:14,346
Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blundered."

1476
01:39:14,986 --> 01:39:16,736
Someone made a mistake?

1477
01:39:17,036 --> 01:39:20,576
Yeah, their leader, their coach.

1478
01:39:23,056 --> 01:39:26,696
But why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up?

1479
01:39:29,816 --> 01:39:34,706
"theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why,

1480
01:39:34,906 --> 01:39:37,906
theirs not to reason to die,

1481
01:39:38,796 --> 01:39:41,696
Into the valley of death rode the six hundred."

1482
01:39:44,616 --> 01:39:47,046
They're all gonna die, aren't they?

1483
01:39:48,556 --> 01:39:49,586
Yeah.

1484
01:39:53,206 --> 01:39:55,476
That's really, really sad.

1485
01:39:59,086 --> 01:40:02,486
I think you just found something to write about, Michael.

1486
01:40:18,266 --> 01:40:20,566
Courage is a hard thing to figure.

1487
01:40:20,776 --> 01:40:24,546
You can have courage based on a dumb idea or mistake,

1488
01:40:25,006 --> 01:40:27,216
But you're not supposed to question adults,

1489
01:40:27,266 --> 01:40:29,686
Or your coach or your teacher

1490
01:40:29,926 --> 01:40:31,926
Because they make the rules.

1491
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:34,126
Maybe they know best

1492
01:40:34,626 --> 01:40:36,606
But maybe they don't.

1493
01:40:37,326 --> 01:40:40,436
It all depends on who you are, where you come from.

1494
01:40:41,576 --> 01:40:42,932
Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys

1495
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:44,516
think about giving up.

1496
01:40:44,566 --> 01:40:46,766
And joining with the other side?

1497
01:40:46,956 --> 01:40:50,126
I mean, valley of death that's pretty salty stuff.

1498
01:40:53,216 --> 01:40:55,366
That's why courage it's tricky.

1499
01:40:56,046 --> 01:40:58,996
Should you always do what others tell you to do?

1500
01:41:00,186 --> 01:41:03,356
Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something.

1501
01:41:03,406 --> 01:41:05,836
I mean any fool can have courage.

1502
01:41:06,886 --> 01:41:09,053
But honor, that's the real reason you

1503
01:41:09,054 --> 01:41:10,986
either do something or you don't.

1504
01:41:11,456 --> 01:41:14,436
It's who you are and maybe who you want to be.

1505
01:41:15,846 --> 01:41:18,096
If you die trying for something important

1506
01:41:18,146 --> 01:41:20,496
Then you have both honor and courage

1507
01:41:20,746 --> 01:41:22,786
And that's pretty good.

1508
01:41:23,246 --> 01:41:25,646
I think that's what the writer was saying.

1509
01:41:25,696 --> 01:41:28,866
That you should hope for courage and try for honor.

1510
01:41:29,696 --> 01:41:31,733
And maybe even pray that the people

1511
01:41:31,734 --> 01:41:33,946
telling you what to do have some, too.

1512
01:41:39,336 --> 01:41:41,166
Kevin Lynn.

1513
01:41:45,996 --> 01:41:47,746
- Good job. - Excuse me.

1514
01:41:50,226 --> 01:41:52,426
Matthew Nicols.

1515
01:41:53,966 --> 01:41:55,686
2.52
2.52.

1516
01:41:57,016 --> 01:41:58,666
Michael's final GPA.

1517
01:41:58,766 --> 01:41:59,966
Got it off Paul's computer.

1518
01:42:00,016 --> 01:42:01,350
Jamie North.

1519
01:42:01,446 --> 01:42:03,396
He did it, Sean. He did it!

1520
01:42:04,176 --> 01:42:07,376
Baby, you've been broken to the principal's computer?

1521
01:42:09,196 --> 01:42:10,796
Michael Oher.

1522
01:42:18,076 --> 01:42:20,966
Where in the world did you find a baby picture of Michael?

1523
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:24,216
Scanned it off an internet ad for a toddler boutique.

1524
01:42:30,276 --> 01:42:32,176
Congratulations, mike.

1525
01:42:48,476 --> 01:42:50,226
Michael, our greetings.

1526
01:42:53,446 --> 01:42:54,956
Way to go, bro!

1527
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:58,116
Alright, that's enough. Young man...

1528
01:42:59,034 --> 01:43:01,044
I think I need a proper hug.

1529
01:43:05,586 --> 01:43:08,535
- Alright. You're gonna be staying in Deaton Hall - Where is it?

1530
01:43:08,585 --> 01:43:11,406
109. It's right there. And you're gonna be on a meal plan

1531
01:43:11,456 --> 01:43:12,641
So you're gonna be eating all the way here in Johnson Commons. Right there.

1532
01:43:13,876 --> 01:43:16,456
Johnson commons has all you can eat self-serve ice cream.

1533
01:43:16,506 --> 01:43:17,646
As much as you want?

1534
01:43:17,696 --> 01:43:20,496
Yes, that's how mama put on her freshman ten.

1535
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:23,296
Stop it!

1536
01:43:26,256 --> 01:43:27,506
Hello?

1537
01:43:29,606 --> 01:43:31,016
This is Mrs. Tuohy.

1538
01:43:31,066 --> 01:43:33,126
He just want ask you a couple of questions, Michael.

1539
01:43:33,176 --> 01:43:35,026
You have nothing to hide.

1540
01:43:36,296 --> 01:43:37,936
Ms. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?

1541
01:43:38,126 --> 01:43:40,056
My name is Jocelyn Granger

1542
01:43:40,106 --> 01:43:41,886
and I'm the assistant director Of enforcement for the NCAA.

1543
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:43,936
Please, call me Leigh Anne.

1544
01:43:46,956 --> 01:43:48,636
So, let's do this. Shall we?

1545
01:43:48,686 --> 01:43:50,711
Ms. Tuohy, if you wouldn't mind

1546
01:43:50,712 --> 01:43:52,736
I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.

1547
01:43:52,786 --> 01:43:55,536
- And how long is that gonna take? - Awhile.

1548
01:43:57,976 --> 01:44:00,846
Go, mike. Okay? Go.

1549
01:44:04,526 --> 01:44:08,276
Michael? Michael! I'll be waiting for you in the lobby, alright?

1550
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:16,446
I don't know, Sean. I just have a bad feeling about this one.

1551
01:44:16,778 --> 01:44:19,455
This woman is tough, tough... hold on.

1552
01:44:22,846 --> 01:44:25,036
The client wants what?

1553
01:44:25,606 --> 01:44:28,846
Were you aware that coach Cotton is accepting a job at Ole Miss?

1554
01:44:28,896 --> 01:44:29,856
No.

1555
01:44:29,906 --> 01:44:33,256
And that this job offer came after you signed with them?

1556
01:44:34,036 --> 01:44:36,736
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian went to Ole Miss.

1557
01:44:36,886 --> 01:44:38,466
He played basketball.

1558
01:44:38,516 --> 01:44:41,056
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.

1559
01:44:41,106 --> 01:44:42,806
She was a cheerleader.

1560
01:44:42,886 --> 01:44:45,466
Is this safe to say that Ole Miss is their favorite school?

1561
01:44:45,516 --> 01:44:47,635
Did they like any other universities?

1562
01:44:47,636 --> 01:44:49,266
What about, say Tennessee?

1563
01:44:49,556 --> 01:44:51,706
No. They can't stand Tennessee.

1564
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:55,246
- And your tutor... - Miss Sue.

1565
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:58,536
Miss Sue. Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.

1566
01:45:00,306 --> 01:45:03,606
Miss Sue ever tried to persuade you to attend Ole Miss?

1567
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:12,106
Did you know that the Tuohys make generous donations to Ole Miss?

1568
01:45:12,156 --> 01:45:14,836
That even Miss Sue makes donations?

1569
01:45:15,116 --> 01:45:17,346
That the Tuohys, they have a condo in Oxford

1570
01:45:17,396 --> 01:45:20,556
so they can attend as many athletic events as possible?

1571
01:45:20,606 --> 01:45:23,174
That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy

1572
01:45:23,175 --> 01:45:25,486
are by our definition... "boosters."

1573
01:45:28,146 --> 01:45:29,646
Mr. Oher.

1574
01:45:30,276 --> 01:45:31,666
Mr. Oher?

1575
01:45:32,336 --> 01:45:35,286
Do you understand... do you know, why am I here?

1576
01:45:36,346 --> 01:45:38,176
To... investigate.

1577
01:45:38,276 --> 01:45:40,246
Yes. To investigate.

1578
01:45:41,226 --> 01:45:45,076
I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament.

1579
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:49,266
Do you find it odd? Your predicament?

1580
01:45:51,626 --> 01:45:52,896
Michael?...

1581
01:45:53,986 --> 01:45:55,306
Iono.

1582
01:45:57,026 --> 01:45:58,746
Can I... can I leave now?

1583
01:45:58,796 --> 01:46:00,376
No. You can't.

1584
01:46:02,036 --> 01:46:04,166
- What do you want, ma'am?  - I want the facts!

1585
01:46:04,216 --> 01:46:05,966
- I need the truth.  - I didn't lie!

1586
01:46:06,016 --> 01:46:08,091
And I want to know what you think about all this.

1587
01:46:08,092 --> 01:46:10,166
Think about what?!

1588
01:46:18,656 --> 01:46:23,906
The NCAA fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened

1589
01:46:24,866 --> 01:46:26,896
That boosters from lots of schools in the south

1590
01:46:26,946 --> 01:46:29,426
will become legal guardians for young athletes without means

1591
01:46:29,476 --> 01:46:31,926
And funnel them to their alma maters.

1592
01:46:32,816 --> 01:46:36,116
I'm not saying I believe it and I'm not saying I don't,

1593
01:46:36,276 --> 01:46:38,146
But there're many people involved with this case

1594
01:46:38,196 --> 01:46:41,026
who would argue that Tuohys they took you in,

1595
01:46:41,516 --> 01:46:43,666
- They clothes you, they fed you. - No.

1596
01:46:43,716 --> 01:46:45,666
- They paid for your private education, - No.

1597
01:46:45,716 --> 01:46:47,096
- They bought you a car, - No!

1598
01:46:47,146 --> 01:46:48,776
- And paid for your tutor, - No.

1599
01:46:48,826 --> 01:46:50,281
All as part of a plan

1600
01:46:50,282 --> 01:46:53,876
to insure that you play football for the university of Mississippi.

1601
01:47:11,356 --> 01:47:13,936
Michael! We're not finished.

1602
01:47:14,776 --> 01:47:17,306
It's not available. Just like I told you three months ago.

1603
01:47:17,356 --> 01:47:19,676
So why don't we go with the canvas.

1604
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:21,781
The low napa, it's a beautiful---

1605
01:47:21,782 --> 01:47:23,066
Oh, I'll call you back. Bye.

1606
01:47:23,116 --> 01:47:25,016
Michael. So what happened?

1607
01:47:25,696 --> 01:47:28,136
- Why'd you do it?  - What?

1608
01:47:28,426 --> 01:47:30,936
All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

1609
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:33,236
Of course, I did. We love Ole Miss!

1610
01:47:33,286 --> 01:47:34,376
Why did you do this for me?

1611
01:47:34,426 --> 01:47:35,966
- What?  - Everything!

1612
01:47:36,016 --> 01:47:38,216
Was it for you or was it for me?

1613
01:47:38,406 --> 01:47:41,406
Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?!

1614
01:47:41,546 --> 01:47:43,806
Was it so I would do what you wanted?!

1615
01:47:43,856 --> 01:47:46,506
- Michael, no... - That's what she thinks.

1616
01:47:47,006 --> 01:47:48,256
Is she right?

1617
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:49,971
Michael, honey,

1618
01:47:49,972 --> 01:47:51,056
I need for you just listen to me, alright?

1619
01:47:51,106 --> 01:47:53,106
Don't you dare to lie to me.

1620
01:47:56,266 --> 01:47:57,826
I'm not stupid!

1621
01:47:58,176 --> 01:47:59,456
Michael?!

1622
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:01,136
Michael, of course, you're not stupid.

1623
01:48:01,186 --> 01:48:02,816
Michael?! Come on.

1624
01:48:07,316 --> 01:48:09,186
I should have followed him.

1625
01:48:09,236 --> 01:48:11,836
You had no way of knowing he'd disappear.

1626
01:48:14,206 --> 01:48:15,936
Was he right?

1627
01:48:16,776 --> 01:48:18,606
What he said about us?

1628
01:48:18,786 --> 01:48:20,196
Leigh Anne, be reasonable.

1629
01:48:20,246 --> 01:48:22,566
We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts.

1630
01:48:22,616 --> 01:48:24,316
We gave him a bed.

1631
01:48:24,606 --> 01:48:26,346
To hell with the NCAA,

1632
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:27,796
I'd do it again tomorrow.

1633
01:48:27,976 --> 01:48:30,126
What about all the rest of it

1634
01:48:30,676 --> 01:48:34,226
All the stuff we did to make sure that he got a scholarship?

1635
01:48:35,056 --> 01:48:37,236
A scholarship at Ole Miss.

1636
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,946
He could go whenever he wanted, he knew that.

1637
01:48:39,996 --> 01:48:42,516
Oh, did he? Did you ask him?

1638
01:48:43,226 --> 01:48:45,626
'Cause I sure as I know I never did.

1639
01:48:49,946 --> 01:48:51,146
Come here.

1640
01:49:07,976 --> 01:49:13,506
Am I a good person? Not a joke. Not rhetorical.

1641
01:49:16,486 --> 01:49:19,236
You're the best person I know.

1642
01:49:21,606 --> 01:49:24,176
Everything you do, you do for others.

1643
01:49:26,896 --> 01:49:28,656
And why is that?

1644
01:49:31,496 --> 01:49:33,296
I have not a clue.

1645
01:49:33,926 --> 01:49:38,126
But you obviously get some sort of sick satisfaction out of it.

1646
01:49:44,306 --> 01:49:46,206
- Sean... - Yeah?

1647
01:49:47,356 --> 01:49:49,356
What if he never comes back?

1648
01:49:56,386 --> 01:49:57,856
Oh, shit!

1649
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:03,786
Big Mike? Hey, get your ass in here, man.

1650
01:50:03,966 --> 01:50:05,516
I'm looking for my moms.

1651
01:50:05,566 --> 01:50:08,066
Your mama? Yeah, I seen dee dee around.

1652
01:50:09,036 --> 01:50:10,986
As a matter of fact...

1653
01:50:11,536 --> 01:50:15,046
Oh, yeah. She usually stop by for a taste around this time.

1654
01:50:15,286 --> 01:50:17,696
But I tell you what. Why don't you just come inside

1655
01:50:17,746 --> 01:50:19,330
I'll get you a forty

1656
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:21,346
and we're gonna chop it up like real fo,

1657
01:50:21,596 --> 01:50:23,346
Just 'til she get here.

1658
01:50:25,566 --> 01:50:28,186
Come on, man. Nobody gonna bite you, man.

1659
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,948
Hey! Big Mike! Man, go down there and have a seat.

1660
01:50:43,246 --> 01:50:45,436
Hey, baby, gimme a couple of cold beers from the refrigerator!

1661
01:50:45,486 --> 01:50:46,896
Sit down, man. Big Mike.

1662
01:50:46,946 --> 01:50:49,146
- What?  - I'm so glad to see you.

1663
01:50:49,506 --> 01:50:52,306
Yeah. You lookin' good. Too, you lookin' fit.

1664
01:50:52,686 --> 01:50:54,886
I heard you playin' little ball.

1665
01:50:55,376 --> 01:50:57,397
But you know that rich kid football

1666
01:50:57,398 --> 01:50:59,476
ain't like the public school league.

1667
01:50:59,526 --> 01:51:02,386
Niggers packing knives in their socks.

1668
01:51:03,356 --> 01:51:05,606
Hey, I played little ball myself.

1669
01:51:05,806 --> 01:51:08,126
Back in the day, you know that, alright?

1670
01:51:08,176 --> 01:51:09,236
Yeah, I heard.

1671
01:51:09,286 --> 01:51:11,996
A quarterback. Up there at MLK.

1672
01:51:14,366 --> 01:51:16,446
- Thank you, baby.  - What about you, Dave?

1673
01:51:16,496 --> 01:51:18,456
You still playing ball over at JC?

1674
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:19,706
- Naw. - No, man.

1675
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,616
Dave no longer a student.

1676
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:23,266
He with me now!

1677
01:51:23,396 --> 01:51:27,116
As a matter of fact... look, I can open a spot for you, too.

1678
01:51:27,456 --> 01:51:29,556
I got tired of going to class.

1679
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,806
People are tryin' tell me what to do.

1680
01:51:31,856 --> 01:51:34,266
Well, in that case, Dave, look here...

1681
01:51:34,316 --> 01:51:36,966
Turn it up, like that little bit of bitch!

1682
01:51:37,876 --> 01:51:39,226
Bitch!

1683
01:51:41,816 --> 01:51:44,356
Hey, man. Don't mess with D, man.

1684
01:51:46,406 --> 01:51:49,256
I heard you stayin' on the other side of town.

1685
01:51:49,766 --> 01:51:51,473
Yeah, that what dee dee said.

1686
01:51:51,474 --> 01:51:53,026
Said you got a new mama now.

1687
01:51:53,076 --> 01:51:54,966
- Yeah?  - Oh yeah!

1688
01:51:55,056 --> 01:51:57,256
- She fine too.  - Yeah. She fine.

1689
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,916
She got other kids?

1690
01:52:04,656 --> 01:52:06,206
She got a daughter?

1691
01:52:08,286 --> 01:52:09,776
You tap that?

1692
01:52:13,516 --> 01:52:15,786
Yeah, you taped that! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1693
01:52:15,836 --> 01:52:16,506
Big Mike!

1694
01:52:16,556 --> 01:52:19,476
Big Mike got his white babes!  He looks innocent.

1695
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:22,316
Hey, Big Mike!

1696
01:52:22,646 --> 01:52:24,676
You should enjoy 'em, man.

1697
01:52:24,866 --> 01:52:26,386
Hey, where you going?

1698
01:52:26,436 --> 01:52:28,986
Going to wait my mom to the apartment.

1699
01:52:33,096 --> 01:52:34,866
Hey, man, just don't go away now.

1700
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:35,986
Hey, sit down, man.

1701
01:52:36,036 --> 01:52:38,040
I'm just trying to find out little

1702
01:52:38,041 --> 01:52:39,986
bit about your fine white sister.

1703
01:52:40,056 --> 01:52:42,856
Because I like me some mommy/daughter action.

1704
01:52:43,156 --> 01:52:44,646
Shut up.

1705
01:52:49,086 --> 01:52:52,566
Shut up? Who the hell is you telling to shut up?

1706
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:58,756
I will bust and cap your fat ass.

1707
01:52:59,056 --> 01:53:02,216
And then drive east and pay a visit to your cracker mom!

1708
01:53:02,266 --> 01:53:04,366
And her sweet little daughter.

1709
01:53:36,356 --> 01:53:37,546
Mama!!!!!

1710
01:54:00,306 --> 01:54:02,686
He gone, snowflake.

1711
01:54:09,116 --> 01:54:10,566
Michael was here?

1712
01:54:10,676 --> 01:54:13,356
Yeah, but you tell him, I'll be seeing him around.

1713
01:54:13,406 --> 01:54:15,206
Or he gonna get this.

1714
01:54:15,436 --> 01:54:17,036
So Michael was here?

1715
01:54:17,326 --> 01:54:19,406
Last night. He come by here.

1716
01:54:19,407 --> 01:54:20,526
Sneaked me then run off.

1717
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,496
Yeah. Tell him, sleep with one eye open.

1718
01:54:25,056 --> 01:54:26,606
You hear me, bitch?

1719
01:54:32,656 --> 01:54:35,036
No, you hear me, bitch!

1720
01:54:35,866 --> 01:54:38,596
You threaten my son you threaten me.

1721
01:54:39,526 --> 01:54:42,866
You so much as cross downtown you will be sorry.

1722
01:54:43,026 --> 01:54:45,014
I'm in a prayer group with the D.A.,

1723
01:54:45,015 --> 01:54:46,506
I'm a member of the NRA.

1724
01:54:46,556 --> 01:54:48,316
And I'm always packing.

1725
01:54:53,276 --> 01:54:55,353
What you got in there, a .22?

1726
01:54:55,354 --> 01:54:56,576
A saturday night special?

1727
01:54:58,806 --> 01:55:01,756
And it shoots just fine, all the other days, too.

1728
01:55:27,036 --> 01:55:28,976
- Michael?! - Mama?...

1729
01:55:56,828 --> 01:55:59,678
You think the police is gonna come and get me?

1730
01:56:00,146 --> 01:56:02,366
I'd imagine the last thing they want at Hurt Village

1731
01:56:02,416 --> 01:56:04,666
is bunch of cops snooping around.

1732
01:56:08,306 --> 01:56:11,416
I swore I'd never ask this,

1733
01:56:11,417 --> 01:56:13,416
but how'd you get out of there, Michael?

1734
01:56:16,036 --> 01:56:19,136
When I was little and something awful was happening

1735
01:56:19,746 --> 01:56:22,536
My mama would tell me to close my eyes.

1736
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:24,187
She was tryin' to keep me from

1737
01:56:24,188 --> 01:56:26,871
seeing her do drugs or other bad things.

1738
01:56:27,406 --> 01:56:30,366
And then when she was finished or the bad things were over

1739
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:35,106
She'd say, "now when I count to three, you open your eyes

1740
01:56:36,176 --> 01:56:39,126
And the past is gone, the world is a good place,

1741
01:56:39,306 --> 01:56:41,676
And it's all gonna be okay."

1742
01:56:44,266 --> 01:56:45,916
You closed your eyes.

1743
01:56:49,266 --> 01:56:53,656
You know, when I was driving all over kingdom come looking for you

1744
01:56:53,926 --> 01:56:56,236
I kept thinking about one thing.

1745
01:56:57,646 --> 01:56:59,326
Ferdinand the Bull.

1746
01:57:02,696 --> 01:57:06,096
I know I should have asked this a long time ago, Michael.

1747
01:57:07,436 --> 01:57:09,836
Do you even wanna play football?

1748
01:57:10,756 --> 01:57:12,906
I mean do you even like it?

1749
01:57:14,196 --> 01:57:17,256
- I'm pretty good at it.  - Yeah, you are.

1750
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:22,322
Sean and I have been talking and...

1751
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:25,722
Michael, if you're gonna accept the football scholarship.

1752
01:57:26,836 --> 01:57:29,186
We think it should be to Tennessee.

1753
01:57:32,036 --> 01:57:37,096
And I promise that I will be at every game cheering for you.

1754
01:57:38,086 --> 01:57:40,236
- Every game?  - Every game.

1755
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:45,356
But I will not wear that gaudy orange. I will not.

1756
01:57:45,406 --> 01:57:48,656
It is not in my color wheel and I'm not gonna wear it.

1757
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:53,556
So you want me to go to Tennessee?

1758
01:57:54,946 --> 01:57:57,836
I want you to do whatever you want.

1759
01:57:58,566 --> 01:58:01,366
It is your decision, Michael. It's your life.

1760
01:58:03,346 --> 01:58:05,566
What if I want to flip burgers?

1761
01:58:09,106 --> 01:58:12,016
It's your decision; it's your life.

1762
01:58:14,896 --> 01:58:16,066
Okay.

1763
01:58:17,996 --> 01:58:19,276
Okay, what?

1764
01:58:21,806 --> 01:58:23,956
I'm sorry I left the other day.

1765
01:58:24,066 --> 01:58:27,296
- You were pretty upset. - You ask a lot of questions.

1766
01:58:27,346 --> 01:58:28,946
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.

1767
01:58:28,996 --> 01:58:32,276
But all questions you asked were about why everybody else

1768
01:58:32,326 --> 01:58:34,306
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

1769
01:58:34,356 --> 01:58:35,246
Okay...

1770
01:58:35,296 --> 01:58:38,246
Not once did you ask why did I want to go there.

1771
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,541
Alright, fine, Michael...

1772
01:58:42,542 --> 01:58:44,706
Why do you want to go to Ole Miss?

1773
01:58:45,386 --> 01:58:48,136
Because it's where my family goes to school.

1774
01:58:49,096 --> 01:58:51,696
It's were they've always gone to school.

1775
01:58:58,926 --> 01:59:01,006
College is going to be different experience for you, Michael.

1776
01:59:01,056 --> 01:59:02,326
SJ, stop it.

1777
01:59:02,376 --> 01:59:04,706
- There are lots of distractions. - Have a fun.

1778
01:59:04,756 --> 01:59:06,976
There's gonna be some nimrod in the dorm

1779
01:59:06,977 --> 01:59:09,196
who wants to play video games all night,

1780
01:59:09,246 --> 01:59:11,146
Or goof on the internet.

1781
01:59:11,196 --> 01:59:12,276
Just have fun.

1782
01:59:12,326 --> 01:59:15,396
And you will spend a lot of time at practice, which means...

1783
01:59:15,446 --> 01:59:17,774
Which means you have to

1784
01:59:17,775 --> 01:59:18,356
be very dedicated to your studies, alright?

1785
01:59:18,406 --> 01:59:19,986
SJ, if you don't stop it right---

1786
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:20,796
- Come here. - No.

1787
01:59:20,846 --> 01:59:22,476
Relax, mama.

1788
01:59:22,766 --> 01:59:24,436
I just got back from the library.

1789
01:59:24,486 --> 01:59:26,996
I reserved a private cubicle for the semester.

1790
01:59:27,046 --> 01:59:29,546
Here's your class schedule and our study hall hours.

1791
01:59:29,596 --> 01:59:31,648
Now, if y'all don't mind

1792
01:59:31,649 --> 01:59:33,016
I'm gonna go move into my new apartment.

1793
01:59:33,066 --> 01:59:35,580
- Thank you, Miss Sue. - "Thank you, Miss Sue"

1794
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:37,368
Yeah, yeah, yeah....

1795
01:59:37,556 --> 01:59:39,774
Let's see what you've got. College's writing,

1796
01:59:39,775 --> 01:59:41,526
Good, psychology, math lab...

1797
01:59:41,576 --> 01:59:43,196
It's gonna be good. Just...

1798
01:59:43,246 --> 01:59:45,596
I do not know why. A lot of good classes.

1799
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:47,686
You'll have a lot of fun.

1800
01:59:47,736 --> 01:59:48,836
SJ
SJ!

1801
01:59:51,816 --> 01:59:54,456
Michael Oher, you listen to me, alright?

1802
01:59:55,086 --> 01:59:56,613
I want you to enjoy yourself, but if

1803
01:59:56,614 --> 01:59:58,226
you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock.

1804
01:59:58,276 --> 02:00:00,907
I'll crawl in the car, drive up here to Oxford

1805
02:00:00,908 --> 02:00:02,426
and cut off your penis.

1806
02:00:02,876 --> 02:00:04,376
She means it.

1807
02:00:05,436 --> 02:00:07,106
- Yes ma'am.  - Alright

1808
02:00:10,456 --> 02:00:12,393
Now, 78's gonna be a parking lot.

1809
02:00:12,394 --> 02:00:14,566
So we should be going. Or everyone...

1810
02:00:14,906 --> 02:00:17,056
Say the goodbyes, alright? Here.

1811
02:00:17,316 --> 02:00:17,906
Bye, baby.

1812
02:00:17,956 --> 02:00:20,306
- Thank you, mama. - You're welcome.

1813
02:00:29,236 --> 02:00:31,206
Why'd she always do that?

1814
02:00:31,686 --> 02:00:33,736
She's an onion. Michael.

1815
02:00:33,737 --> 02:00:35,786
You have to peel her back one layer at a time.

1816
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:40,126
I'll be back.

1817
02:00:51,516 --> 02:00:52,816
What?

1818
02:00:59,386 --> 02:01:00,926
What, Michael?

1819
02:01:01,106 --> 02:01:02,776
I need a proper hug.

1820
02:01:26,356 --> 02:01:29,856
I read a story the other day about a boy from the projects.

1821
02:01:30,706 --> 02:01:33,556
No daddy, in and out of foster care.

1822
02:01:34,706 --> 02:01:37,896
He'd been killed in a gang fight at hurt village.

1823
02:01:38,966 --> 02:01:41,012
In the last paragraph they talked

1824
02:01:41,013 --> 02:01:42,996
about his superb athletic skills

1825
02:01:43,606 --> 02:01:45,376
And how different his life might have been

1826
02:01:45,426 --> 02:01:48,626
if he hadn't fallen behind and dropped out of school.

1827
02:01:48,816 --> 02:01:51,566
He was twenty-one years old the day he died.

1828
02:01:52,626 --> 02:01:54,316
It was his birthday.

1829
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:02,266
That could have been anyone.

1830
02:02:02,536 --> 02:02:04,996
It could have been my son, Michael.

1831
02:02:06,096 --> 02:02:07,586
But it wasn't.

1832
02:02:10,806 --> 02:02:13,506
And I suppose I have god to thank for that.

1833
02:02:16,856 --> 02:02:19,166
God and Lawrence Taylor.

1834
02:02:31,353 --> 02:02:32,726
One Mississippi.

1835
02:03:09,856 --> 02:03:12,736
The New England Patriots have traded the twenty third pick

1836
02:03:12,786 --> 02:03:14,586
to the Baltimore Ravens.

1837
02:03:15,576 --> 02:03:18,836
And with the twenty third pick in 2009 NFL draft

1838
02:03:19,196 --> 02:03:21,026
The Baltimore Raven select...

1839
02:03:21,076 --> 02:03:24,146
Michael Oher. Offensive tackle, Mississippi.
