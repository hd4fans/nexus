1
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,065
你沒被跟蹤?
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,447
沒有
No.

3
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,407
還是進來吧
Better come in.

4
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,619
吉姆 別信任任何人
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,787
尤其是大人物
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,753
坐吧
Sit down.

7
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,266
我知道你還有一個匈牙利的身份可用
I understand you still have one H ungarian identity running?

8
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,815
是的
I do.

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,323
我想派你去布達佩斯
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,412
這是秘密任務
'This is not above board.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,626
沒有其他人知道
'Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,672
他們要取我的命 吉姆老弟
'They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,088
你明白嗎?
'Do you understand?

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,823
我得到一個情報
'I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,495
一個匈牙利的將軍
'A Hungarian general wants to come over.

16
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,953
我想讓你跟他碰面
'I would lik e you to meet him.'

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,339
他有我想要的信息 吉姆
He has some information that I need, J im.

18
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,506
什么信息?
What information?

19
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,967
寶藏
Treasure.

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,685
他知道蘇聯人安插在英國情報機關的內線的名字
'He has the name of the mole

21
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,481
'the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,525
他們都是圓場高層 （圓場：英國情報機構的代稱，位于劍橋圓場）
'right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,243
這些爛蘋果 吉姆
'There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,536
我們要把他找出來
'We have to find it.'

25
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,653
來點燉雜肉吧？嘗過這個沒？

26
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,218
是的，我嘗過

27
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,224
這東西很好，比燉牛肉要強 但是你現在在布達佩斯吃不到了

28
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,059
為什么？

29
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,109
因為那些豬都去莫斯科了

30
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,817
我何時能見到你的朋友？

31
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,008
你會見到的，不吃點嗎？

32
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:13,694
容我失陪一下

33
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,812
住手!
Stop!

34
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:24,989
誰讓你開槍的？

35
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,450
誰他媽的讓你開槍的？

36
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,642
你會為我做見證嗎?
Would you witness this for me?

37
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,436
我希望能做得更多 老總
I wish I could done more, Control.

38
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,151
你已經盡力了 潘西
You did all you could, Percy.

39
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,986
哎 一個人應該知道什么時候退場
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.

40
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,328
史邁利呢?
What about Smiley?

41
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,623
史邁利和我一起走
Smiley is leaving with me.

42
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,233
你這個滑頭 伊斯特哈斯
You little prick, Esterhase.

43
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:05,294
《鍋匠 裁縫 士兵 間諜》

44
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,161
各位 我們可以開始了嗎?
Gentlemen, shall we start?

45
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,054
副部長拉康已經在等您了 潘西先生
U nder Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.

46
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,602
財政部不懂
The Treasury don't understand.

47
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,946
為什么情報局不能直接申請
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request

48
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,656
普通的增撥資金
for a general increase in funding

49
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,697
那不就可以支持你們的特殊任務了嗎?
and then you account for the spend on your special operation?

50
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,576
“巫術行動”需要保密
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.

51
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,667
-它有自己的一套 -這正是我們擔心的
- It's a fiefdom of its own. - Yes, that's what's worrying us.

52
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,411
這整一件事讓人摸不著頭腦 不是嗎?
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?

53
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,754
這個房子在倫敦哪兒大家都不知道
And this London house that nobody knows the address of,

54
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,501
真的有這個需要嗎?
is that really necessary?

55
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,005
絕對有必要 要保護我們在蘇聯的線人
Now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.

56
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,851
你要我們在哪里跟他碰面? 咖啡店嗎?
So where do you propose we meet? In a caf?

57
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,686
這房子的租金和花費差不多是平常的兩倍
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.

58
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,895
在核武上就花了好幾百萬
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

59
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,895
我們不過要幾千塊租個房子
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.

60
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,022
我好奇卡拉在克里姆林宮里 （卡拉：蘇聯情報機構頭目）
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

61
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,864
是不是有著同樣的煩惱
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

62
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,529
聽好 沒有人低估
Look, nobody underestimates

63
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,277
你們工作的重要性
the importance of the job you chaps are doing.

64
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,700
但去年在布達佩斯發生的事
But what happened in Budapest last year,

65
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,583
那簡直是一個災難
that was a disaster.

66
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,623
坦白說
With respect, sir,

67
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,793
被殺的人不是你們辦公室里的公務員
it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?

68
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,337
現在說的也不是戰壕里的士兵
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.

69
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,711
-是我們在前線的... -羅埃!
- We're the front line now... - Roy!

70
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,260
25年以來 我們唯一一次可以走近卡拉
For 25 years we've been the only thing standing between them and Karla

71
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,633
走近莫斯科 甚至走近了他媽的第三次世界大戰
and Moscow and the third bloody world war.

72
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,938
聽好了 大臣非常滿意你們目前的成果
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.

73
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,733
不過 他對你們
He's less pleased, though,

74
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,478
跟美國人缺少協作這點不甚滿意
with the lack of progress with our American cousins.

75
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,568
你看
You see,

76
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,737
在他們的眼里
in their eyes,

77
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,361
你們還是爛船一艘
you're still a leaky ship.

78
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,554
怎樣?
Yes?

79
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,720
電話有人找你 長官 像是急事
'Someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent. '

80
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,593
好的 把電話接進來
All right, well put him through.

81
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,766
-喂? -是副部長拉康嗎?
- Hello? - 'Ls this U nder Secretary Lacon? '

82
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,267
是的
Yes.

83
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,611
我叫里基·塔爾
My name's Ricki Tarr.

84
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,068
-你想怎樣? -我要見你
- 'What do you want? ' - I need to meet you.

85
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,740
如果你想確認我的身份 可以去找我在圓場里的上司
If you need to confirm who I am, you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

86
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,612
彼得·吉勒姆
Peter Guillam.

87
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,411
只能是吉勒姆 不能找別人
But only Guillam, no one else.

88
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,514
都處理掉了嗎?
You got clearance for that?

89
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,510
我不負責在外面捉人
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.

90
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,308
我提醒你 這里也許已經不安全了 到處是刺客
Mind you, no better off in here with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

91
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,978
連他們的牙齒里也藏著武器
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

92
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,648
我比布蘭德早一步瞅到一個新來的女孩 他見過她沒?
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

93
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,113
啊 對 金發美女 貝琳達
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

94
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,324
-他見過她沒? -他當然見過了
- Has he seen her yet? - Of course he has.

95
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,114
今早一來到的這兒的頭等大事
Came down first thing this morning.

96
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,952
貝琳達
Belinda.

97
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,007
-彼得·吉勒姆 -喂 彼得 我是奧利弗
- Peter Guillam. - 'Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

98
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,718
我打電話來問一下...
'Just ringing to find out...

99
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,339
'So Winston Churchill saved your life, Edie.'

100
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,058
'I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.

101
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,927
'And he was late, you see.'

102
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,429
- 'During a raid? ' - 'During a raid, you see.'

103
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,397
'He said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?"'

104
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,062
- 'Why weren't you? ' - 'Well, because... '

105
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,663
老總的事 我很遺憾 史邁利先生
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.

106
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,924
他說塔爾從電話亭打電話給他
'He said Tarr called him from a phone box.'

107
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,773
他說有只地鼠
He said there's a mole,

108
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,194
潛伏在圓場的高層
right at the top of the Circus,

109
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,986
已經好幾年了
that he's been there for years.

110
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,296
這就意味著
It does mean

111
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,424
你現在相當適合幫我們調查這件事
you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now,

112
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,597
不是嗎?
doesn't it?

113
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,387
作為一個局外人
Outside the family.

114
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,941
我已經退休了 奧利弗
I'm retired, Oliver.

115
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,284
你炒了我
You fired me.

116
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,278
事實上
The thing is,

117
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,326
之前老總還在的時候
some time ago before Control died,

118
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,040
他跟我提過類似的想法
he came to me with a similar suggestion.

119
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,415
圓場有地鼠
That there is a mole.

120
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,709
他沒有跟你提起過他的猜疑嗎?
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?

121
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,132
沒有
No.

122
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,883
我只是以為.... 你是他的人
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...

123
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,351
你怎么回應他的?
What did you say to him?

124
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,266
我當時以為他犯了偏執病
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had rather gotten the better of him

125
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,357
打算自己拆自己的臺
and he was going to pull his whole house down.

126
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,601
還有布達佩斯那個爛攤子
That bloody mess in Budapest.

127
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,990
去他的 喬治
Damn it, George.

128
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,201
這是你的時代 你的輝煌
It's your generation, your legacy.

129
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,990
我應該想到的 如果這屬實的話 你會想...
I would have thought, if there's any truth in it, you'd want to...

130
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,068
彼得留下給我用吧
I'll k eep Peter.

131
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,827
還有那個退休警察 孟德爾
And there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.

132
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,080
我也要
I should lik e to have him.

133
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,494
- Lift up.

134
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,503
And quickly down again.

135
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,014
我知道有個地方 在利物浦街附近的一家小旅館
There's a place I know, sir. A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

136
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,171
請小心點　這是喬治王朝風格的
Be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.

137
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,094
我朋友需要一個安靜的工作環境 蒲波-格雷漢姆太太
My friend wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.

138
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,342
沒有干擾的環境
No disturbances.

139
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,811
她的真名只有格雷漢姆
Her real name is just Graham.

140
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,056
加上“蒲波”是為了表示等級
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

141
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,871
彼得 你能拿到老總公寓的鑰匙嗎?
'Peter, did you get the k eys to Control's flat? '

142
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:05,629
# And did those feet in ancient time

143
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,008
# Walk upon England's mountains green #

144
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,811
噢!
Oh!

145
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,104
喬治!
'George! '

146
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,565
喬治! 給我進來!
George, get in here!

147
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,864
喬治
George.

148
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,580
坐下
Sit down.

149
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,083
看看這份不知所謂的東西
Tak e a look at this nonsense.

150
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,594
這是蘇聯最高指揮部
Report by Soviet high command

151
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,591
就近期他們在黑海的海軍演習發回的報告
on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.

152
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,389
這正是海軍部向我們
Just what the admiralty has been begging us

153
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,227
乞求的情報
for some information on.

154
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,606
-你從哪里搞到的? -不是我搞來的
- Where did you get this? - I didn't.

155
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,600
不是我 是潘西和他的小團伙拿來的
Percy and his little cabal walk ed in with it.

156
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,819
-老總 這... -閉嘴
- Look, Control... - Shut up.

157
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,984
文風差得令人發指
Style appalling.

158
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,109
明顯是徹頭徹尾地瞎編亂作
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.

159
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,363
-不過倒像是真的 -如果內容屬實就等于挖到了金礦
- Just could be the real thing. - Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

160
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,208
但這個話題總是惹人猜疑
But its topicality mak es it suspect.

161
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,625
史邁利生性多疑 潘西
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

162
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,590
從哪兒弄來的? 通過什么渠道得來?
Where did it come from? What's the access?

163
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,709
我的一個新線人
A new secret source of mine.

164
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,506
可是他怎么可能弄到…?
But how could he possibly have access?

165
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,802
他連最高決策層的機密都有辦法搞到
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.

166
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,308
我們把這個情報源稱之為“巫術”
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

167
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,395
史邁利 潘西和他的搭檔們已經繞過了我們
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.

168
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,684
直接去找部長了
Gone straight to the minister.

169
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:08,106
潘西可以對他新伙計的身份
Percy has been allowed to k eep the identity of his new friend

170
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,648
絕對保密
top secret.

171
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,400
部長與我一致認為這里充斥了太多不清不楚的事情
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.

172
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,446
接二連三的失敗 數不清的丑聞
Too much failure, too many scandals.

173
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,912
-可靠的情報卻少得可憐 -潘西說到點子上了 老總
- Too little solid intelligence. - Percy does have a point, Control.

174
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,657
我們該對抗的是共產主義 而不是自己人
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.

175
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,501
這些爭斗毀了我們的名聲 也讓我們失去了同盟伙伴...
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.

176
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,961
你們這些惡毒的美國佬!
Your bloody Yank s!

177
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,502
我們已經受夠了! 是時候改變了
We've had enough! There's going to be changes.

178
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,422
我們要想清楚 是要活在過去 還是要創造未來
We need to decide if want to be part of the past or part of the future.

179
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,671
從哪兒來的給我滾回哪兒去
I should have left you where I found you.

180
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,844
-聽好! -老總...
- Look! - Control...

181
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,683
滾! 全都給我滾!
Out, all of you!

182
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,792
如果“巫術情報”是真的...
If Witchcraft is genuine...

183
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,253
再也沒有東西是真的
Nothing is genuine any more.

184
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,606
喬治...
George...

185
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,647
你要我把東西搬到旅館去嗎?
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?

186
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,969
謝謝 隨便放
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

187
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,342
-彼得? -嗯?
- Peter? - Hm?

188
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,842
彼得 我需要你幫我做點事...
I need you to do something for me.

189
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,444
你到圓場去
I'd lik e you to go to the Circus.

190
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,159
在當值室里的文件柜里
'Ln the cabinet at the duty officers' station

191
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,528
放著近期退休人員的記錄
'are records of staff recently retired.

192
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,623
你拍成照片拿給我
'I'd like photographs of them

193
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:32,167
還有潘西·阿勒萊恩著手重組的圓場架構圖表
'and of the diagram of the Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

194
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,960
別漏了秘密行動基金的支出表
'along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.'

195
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,420
-有什么可以幫你的嗎? 比爾 -我在找老大
- Help you with anything, Bill? - I was just looking for his Majesty.

196
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,710
他在頂樓踱步呢
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

197
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,919
喔
Oh.

198
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:59,174
-聽說你出了點意外 彼得 -對啊 被抽屜拉手弄傷了
- Heard you had an accident, Peter. - Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

199
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,010
你們什么時候能在這里添些新家具啊?
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?

200
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,388
我會跟伊斯特哈斯反映的
I'll have a word with Esterhase. We'll mak e it a priority on the top floor.

201
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,560
我們樓上的人會優先考慮這件事

202
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,887
-你要去哪兒? -吃午飯
- Where are you off to? - Lunch.

203
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,104
一起好嗎?
Want some company?

204
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,232
根據人事文件
According to the personnel files,

205
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,945
有七個人是夠年齡退休
seven were due for retirement anyway.

206
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,315
其他四個人也看不出可疑的地方
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.

207
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,444
杰里·威斯特貝在12月4日被解職
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.

208
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,488
康妮·沙赫斯11月28日退休
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

209
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,788
也就是你和老總被迫出局兩周以后
That's just two week s after you and Control were forced out.

210
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,213
-回牛津 謝謝 -在一點十五分
- Return to Oxford, please. - That's 1. 15.

211
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,779
潘西一向反對
Percy has always resisted any proposal

212
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,700
擴大“巫術情報”的使用范圍的提議
of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.

213
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,697
別給我扯官腔 拉康
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

214
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,667
時至今日 我還是拒絕跟我們的盟國分享“巫術”情報 大臣
I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.

215
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,829
貪婪的家伙
Greedy boy.

216
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,458
毫無疑問地我的目標在一步一步地實現
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.

217
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,383
我看現在是時候去找我們的美國戰友了
I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-arms.

218
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,977
他們會再次拉我們入伙嗎?
- Will they tak e us back into bed? - I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

219
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:37,159
只做一次的買賣我沒興趣

220
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,603
我要的是能長期接觸到美國的情報
I want on-going access to American intelligence.

221
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,319
你認我們能辦到么?
You think we can get it?

222
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,191
只要掌握了“巫術”情報
With Witchcraft on our side, we can get anything we bloody well want.

223
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,409
我們想要得到什么都不成問題

224
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,954
好
Fine.

225
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,074
去做吧
Carry on.

226
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,790
謝謝
Thank you.

227
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,888
And I strik e thee down...

228
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,703
噢 我...
Oh, I, er...

229
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,751
不能喝酒的 醫生的命令
Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

230
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,426
討厭的喬治
Wicked, wick ed George.

231
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,412
我不知道你怎么樣 喬治
I don't know about you, George,

232
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,032
反正我覺得親臨其境
but I feel seriously under-fuck ed.

233
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,042
我聽說安恩又離開你了
I heard Ann left you again.

234
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,176
她不配擁有你 喬治

235
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,924
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.

236
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:31,096
連你的一根頭發都不配 根本都不配

237
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,299
我退休后不久你就離開了圓場
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.

238
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,928
不是我要離開 我是被炒的
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

239
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,933
像垃圾一樣被扔了 跟你一樣
Chuck ed out on the rubbish heap, lik e you.

240
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,058
什么理由?
Why?

241
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,694
波里雅科夫
'Polyak ov.

242
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,693
你記得他嗎?
'Do you remember him? '

243
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,992
蘇聯大使館的人
'From the Soviet Embassy? '

244
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,084
阿里克塞·波里雅科夫
'Alexsey Polyak ov, cultural attach?here in London.

245
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:02,283
在倫敦的文化參事 - 波里雅科夫

246
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,539
十五年前他來到的時候
'When he arrived here 15 years ago, I requested he be check ed out.

247
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,726
是我提出要查他的

248
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,336
對波里雅科夫的評級比洗衣粉還白 沒必要查
'He was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.'

249
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,593
但是你不認同?
'But you disagreed? '

250
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,511
你肯定聽過一個傳言
'There's a story you must have heard

251
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,602
卡拉組織了一個秘密組織
'that Karla has set up a secret cell.

252
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,686
成員都是前軍人
'The personnel are all ex-military,

253
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,900
專門受訓從事深入滲透的特工 地鼠
'trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.'

254
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,815
傳言從來就沒消停過 康妮
'There are always stories, Connie. '

255
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,439
但如果那些傳言是真的呢?
'But what if this story was true?

256
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,195
在研究中心的某個晚上 我看到了些東西 喬治
'One night in research I saw something, George.

257
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,823
我們的好朋友波里雅科夫在柏林的“五一閱兵”禮上
'There was our friend Polyak ov at a May day parade in Berlin

258
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,576
接受敬禮
'receiving a salute.'

259
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,500
為什么要向一個文化參事敬禮?
'Why would you salute a cultural attach? '

260
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,341
莫非波里曾是戰場上的前輩?
'Exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself.'

261
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,179
如果是真的 他為什么要隱瞞呢?
And if he was, why hide the fact?

262
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,968
那你怎么做了?
What did you do?

263
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,716
我直接走到伊斯特哈斯和阿勒萊恩面前
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

264
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,019
這里
Here.

265
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,561
如果我沒弄錯的話 波里雅科夫是卡拉訓練的爪牙
Polyak ov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.

266
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,809
如果他在這里出現 那他肯定是安插了地鼠
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.

267
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,027
你不要再管波里雅科夫的事
You're to leave Polyak ov alone.

268
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,272
你對他有點著迷了
You're becoming obsessed with him.

269
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,448
-你現在做事掌握不了分寸 -太荒謬了!
- You're losing your sense of proportion. - But that's ridiculous.

270
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,698
也許你是時候離開 回到現實世界中去了
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.

271
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:39,173
但又有什么關系呢? 圓場的老人已經散的差不多了
What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway.

272
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,028
看看這個
Here we are.

273
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,197
年少無知的我們
The N ursery in our day.

274
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,285
吉姆·普萊多
Jim Prideaux.

275
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,035
和比爾·海頓 兩個人必定站到一塊兒
And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.

276
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,541
形影不離
The Inseparables.

277
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,838
這是老總
There's Control himself.

278
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,633
大家都在
All my boys.

279
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,716
就像一個大家庭
All my lovely boys.

280
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,766
真是一段美好時光啊 喬治
That was a good time, George.

281
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,568
那可是戰爭啊 康妮

282
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,605
一場真正的戰爭
A real war.

283
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,902
會讓英國人感到自豪
Englishmen could be proud then.

284
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,950
那么 我是對的?
So I was right, then?

285
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,373
波里雅科夫的事
About Polyak ov.

286
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,371
有地鼠?
There is a mole.

287
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:02,424
如果沒處理好 就別來告訴我了
If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were.

288
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,641
我想把記憶定格在以前那個樣子

289
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,019
潘西 這是你干的好事嗎?
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?

290
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,976
哎呀 是我干的
Aye, I did so.

291
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,822
你這個吝嗇的蘇格蘭佬
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

292
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,113
你就不能向外訂餐嗎?
Can you nae learn to tak e a bloody order?

293
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,328
自己胡亂擺弄什么菜譜啊!
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

294
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,288
-我的確是按菜譜做的 -來
- I followed the recipe. - Come on.

295
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,534
跟猴子尿一樣 得喝上五個小時才會喝醉
It'll tak e us five hours to get drunk on this monk ey's piss.

296
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,712
# He's not the first

297
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,711
好吧
- # He's not the first - Oh, well.

298
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,839
圣誕快樂!
- # He's the second best secret agent - Merry Christmas.

299
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,886
# I n the whole wide world

300
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,510
# He's not number one

301
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,184
# But not the worst

302
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,023
# He's just the second best secret agent

303
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,894
# I n the whole wide world

304
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,691
# He's every bit

305
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,030
# As good as what's-his-name

306
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,031
# With a dame

307
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,449
# Any dame

308
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,951
# And all those bullet holes are in his vest

309
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,038
# To prove you work a little harder

310
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,460
# When you're second best... #

311
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,994
-P夫人向你問好 -嗯?
- Courtesy of Mrs P. - H m?

312
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,204
你一夜沒睡?
You been up all night?

313
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,991
是的
Yes.

314
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,045
那是什么?
What's this?

315
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:30,013
申請書 請求從秘密行動經費里提取一千磅現金
Request for ?1,000 in cash from the Reptile fund.

316
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,348
給一個叫埃利斯的人
To a Mr Ellis.

317
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,059
吉姆·普萊多的其中一個化名
It was one of J im Prideaux's work names.

318
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,059
普萊多一年前在匈牙利被殺了
Prideaux was killed in H ungary a year ago.

319
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,648
10月21日
October 21.

320
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,653
怎么會有人在他死后兩個月給他一千磅呢?
So why was someone giving him ?1,000 two months later?

321
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,617
我在想他現在在哪兒呢?
I wonder where he is then, sir.

322
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,769
別鬧了
Settle down now.

323
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,154
-發下去 -先生
- Hand those out. - Sir.

324
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,152
什么玩意啊? 我們的駝子老師?
What is it? The H unchback of Notre-Dame?

325
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,913
叮叮當 叮叮當!
The bells, the bells!

326
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,895
噢!
- Ohh!

327
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,285
過來這里
Come here.

328
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,345
-你叫什么來著? -羅奇 我叫比爾·羅奇 先生

329
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,886
-我是新來的 -新來的 嗯?
- I'm a new boy. - New arrival, eh?

330
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,178
-你什么來歷? -我父母...
- What's the story? - My mother and father.

331
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,261
我爸離開了 所以...
My father left, so...

332
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,728
嗯
Hm.

333
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,307
賬單 （Bill還有賬單的意思）
Bill.

334
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,150
欠費賬單
The unpaid Bill.

335
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,651
-有人這么叫過你么? -沒有 先生
- Anyone ever call you that? - No, sir.

336
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,866
我認識不少人叫比爾
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

337
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,116
都是不錯的家伙
They've all been good 'uns.

338
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,199
你有些什么本事呢?
What are you good at?

339
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,826
沒什么 先生
Nothing, sir.

340
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,796
你是個不錯的觀察者 是嗎?
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

341
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,464
孤獨的人都善于觀察
Us loners always are.

342
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,882
我敢說 比爾·羅奇是班里最好的觀察員
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'II bet.

343
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,678
只要他戴上眼鏡就沒什么能逃過他的眼睛 對么?
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right? - Yes, sir.

344
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:23,897
是的 先生

345
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,182
這個好 非常好
This is good, very good.

346
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,768
在嗎 里基
Hello, Ricki.

347
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,361
你丟了一個楔子
You've missed the wedge.

348
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,871
你去了哪了? 里基
Where have you been, Ricki?

349
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,587
他們要殺我
They're going to kill me.

350
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,255
-誰要殺你? -你們
- Who is? - Your lot.

351
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,723
你們 或者他們 被誰先找到就死在誰手上
Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.

352
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,895
我是無辜的
I'm innocent.

353
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,560
說得過去吧
Within reason.

354
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,309
我會盡力 你在這多久了?
How long have you been here?

355
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,358
抱歉 我已經沒有地方可以躲了
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

356
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,402
我要見你
I needed to see you.

357
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,783
為什么?
Why?

358
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,616
有一個女人
There's a woman.

359
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,618
我要你把她換回來 從卡拉手上把她換回來
I need you to trade for her. I need you to get her back off Karla.

360
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,581
什么女人?
A woman?

361
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,385
她叫伊琳娜
Her name's Irina.

362
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,475
在去年的12月
'This was last November.

363
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:12,438
吉勒姆先生派我去伊斯坦布爾查一個俄國貿易代表
'Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate

364
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,478
一個可能會轉投我們的人
'who might be persuaded to defect.'

365
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,443
-塔夫蒂·西辛格 駐外代表 -嗯
'Tufty Thesinger, resident.' - 'Yeah.'

366
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,028
-喂 里基 -最近好嗎? 兄弟
- H iya, Ricki. - All right, mate?

367
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,741
你認識他? 不 從來見過
'Did you know him? ' 'No, never met him.'

368
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,609
酒鬼一個
'Bit of a drink er.'

369
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,326
整天醉醺醺的
Hangover from hell.

370
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,537
一個蠢貨
'Bit of a fucking idiot.

371
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,746
這個叫鮑里斯的俄國佬
'Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,

372
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,336
在夜總會夜夜笙歌
'was spending high and wide in the nightclubs. '

373
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,046
你的任務就是游說他倒戈?
'So you were sent to persuade this Boris? '

374
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,543
沒錯 他是典型的俄國佬
'Yeah. He was your typical Russian.

375
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,762
貿易代表團就知道沒日沒夜地飲酒作樂
'Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.

376
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,756
好像都不用睡覺似得
'Didn't seem to sleep.

377
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,054
他們幾乎都能認出塔夫蒂了 所以他不方便跟蹤
'Tufty was worn out from following him around.'

378
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,054
我看今晚有的忙了 孩子
I think it's going to be a long night, son.

379
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,932
在塔克西姆 他最愛去的地方就是俱樂部
'His favourite haunt was this club in Tak sim.

380
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,606
那兒的地下室是藏污納垢的地方
'Lt had a hellhole in the basement where the sailors and the tourists went.

381
00:44:57,663 --> 00:44:59,780
供水手和旅客消遣的地方

382
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,233
反正我看了他一眼 就知道自己白來了
'Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

383
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,202
鮑里斯不是什么代表
'Boris was no delegate.

384
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,209
比起代表團 他們更符合酒鬼這個身份
'What delegate bothers to play drunk er than he really is?

385
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,413
你得面對現實 不是嗎? 史邁利先生
'You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr Smiley?

386
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:20,467
鮑里斯就是個流氓

387
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,210
莫斯科中心出來的人 （莫斯科中心：指蘇聯情報機構）
'Moscow Centre trained.'

388
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,884
# Someone is waiting

389
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,802
# I mean just for you

390
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,179
# Spinning wheel

391
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,770
# Keep on spinning through, Drop all your troubles... #

392
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,641
我猜他在等著接頭
'I guessed he was waiting for a connect.

393
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,777
或許在干投信的活兒
'Working a letterbox, maybe.

394
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,491
或許放線釣魚 等著像我這樣的人上鉤
'Or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from some mug like me.'

395
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,782
所以第二晚我就去了進出口部
'So the second night I went to the import/ export outfit

396
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:54,578
塔夫蒂在密室架了一臺加密電報機
'that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.

397
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,747
我給吉勒姆先生發了電報 “沒有交易”
'I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.

398
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,914
就是這樣了
'And that was that.'

399
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,592
你第二天就要搭飛機回去
You were due to fly home the next day.

400
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,130
是
Yes.

401
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,885
但你沒回去
But you didn't.

402
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,605
鮑里斯有個妻子
'Boris had a wife.

403
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,151
合法的妻子
'Common-law.

404
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,116
明顯她也是代表團的成員之一
'Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.

405
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,719
你曾經叫我相信自己對女人的直覺 史邁利先生
'You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr Smiley.

406
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,477
沒錯 我的直覺告訴我這個女人藏著寶藏
'Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.

407
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,104
有一晚鮑里斯不在酒店 我就探入了她住的旅館
'When Boris went out for the night, I found myself going into her hotel.'

408
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,104
所以你丟下了鮑里斯
'So you dropped Boris.'

409
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,608
我知道 那不合規矩
'I know. It was breaking protocol.

410
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,951
但可以說是我不由自主地行動起來
'But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were. '

411
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,076
你的男人就是個混賬東西 不是嗎?
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

412
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,295
我只是想確認一下你沒事 明白嗎?
I just wanted to mak e sure you were all right, OK?

413
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,539
所以你就沒有回來了?
'So you didn't come home? '

414
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,752
我本打算回來的
I would have.

415
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,004
鮑里斯那邊是沒門了 但是...
Boris was a dead end, but...

416
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,466
呃...
Um...

417
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,468
我能
I could...

418
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,726
我能感覺到她心里有事
I could sense something in her.

419
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,191
一個秘密
A secret.

420
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,781
你打算用什么方法把她的秘密套出來?
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?

421
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,075
我用商人邁克·特侖奇的身份
'I played this businessman, Michael Trench.

422
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,126
跟她發生了一段假期戀情
'Holiday romance.'

423
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,754
可惜時間緊迫無法好好享受…
'I thought I'd tak e my time with it.'

424
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,852
我知道你是誰
I know who you are.

425
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,690
我有話要跟你們的上司談
I want to talk to your boss.

426
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,404
老總
Control.

427
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,656
我有東西跟你們做交易
I have something to trade.

428
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,324
很重要的東西
Something big.

429
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,123
我想在西方開始新的生活
I want a new life in the West.

430
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,836
這就是我的開價
That's the deal.

431
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,128
你去告訴他們
You tell them.

432
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,682
你不能指望他們一下子就接受所有的開價
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.

433
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:33,152
既然你不愿多說 那我也無能為力
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.

434
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,493
如果我向你坦白所有
If I tell you everything,

435
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,533
就等于把自己的性命交到你手上
I'm putting my life in your hands.

436
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,000
還有其他人的生死
And the lives of other people.

437
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,439
她告訴我她想要的是什么
'So she told me what she had to trade.

438
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,150
她的秘密
'Her secret.

439
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,612
我指的是
'I mean,

440
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,948
是所有秘密的源頭
'the mother of all secrets.

441
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,578
我告訴她我意識到是關于圓場的
'I told her I'd alert the Circus.

442
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,325
她要我保證不會向倫敦透漏任何細節
'She made me promise I wouldn't give any of the details to London.'

443
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,328
-然后你同意了? -是的
'And you agreed? ' 'Yes.

444
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,293
我告訴你...
'I mean it was...

445
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,667
我都不敢相信自己掌握了這么重要的情報
'I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.

446
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,590
我回到進出口部
'I went back to the import/ export,

447
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,807
給圓場發了個消息 標注為“最高緊急級別”
'sent the message to the Circus, graded, "Flash, highest priority",

448
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,177
只是說 我找到了一個想叛變的莫斯科間諜
'just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.'

449
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:35,149
你怎么還沒走 倫敦站的人找上我了
You're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.

450
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,518
他們要知道你到底在玩什么花樣
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

451
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,032
滾你的
Fuck off.

452
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,243
還有嗎? 里基
'Anything else, Ricki? '

453
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,536
我知道 對于圓場來說 我不過是剝頭皮組的一個嘍羅 （剝頭皮組：圓場內負責搞暗殺、綁架、訛詐的機構）
I know what I am to the Circus. I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

454
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,584
做的是低賤卑鄙的差事
someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.

455
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,714
只是...
I just...

456
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,055
這件事我想由自己來解決
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.

457
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,516
我知道你的感受
Well, I understand how you felt.

458
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,062
你不想這么傻等著
You wanted to do something.

459
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:16,652
我匯報說 她聲稱掌握了

460
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,526
事關圓場生死的情報
Vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

461
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,481
還有別的嗎?
Anything more?

462
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,631
我還說了 她掌握的情報是關于雙面間諜的
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.

463
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:48,256
我不過是想...得到足夠重視 我想...
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...

464
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,388
我讓他們轉告吉勒姆先生 這是我沒有回去的原因
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.

465
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,762
而不是因為我叛變了
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

466
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,563
-接下來你做了什么? -等著他們回復
- What did you do then? - I waited for a reply.

467
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,443
我就等了幾個小時 我聽到在黎明前的禱告
'I hung around for hours. I heard the lmsak call to prayer.

468
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,447
那是幾點呢? 大約在凌晨的三點三十分
'So what's that? That's about 3. 30 in the morning.'

469
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,783
然后消息就發過來了
'Then the message comes through.

470
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,131
“知道了”
"'We read you."

471
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,427
那就是他們發過來的 什么也沒用
'That was all they sent. Nothing.

472
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,886
根本說不通 像是他們在拖延時間
'Lt didn't mak e sense. It was lik e they were stalling.'

473
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,520
然后的事呢?
'Then what happened?

474
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,610
接下來 突然間...
'Then, all of a sudden...

475
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,777
...俄國佬開始行動了
'... the Russians begin to move.'

476
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:25,106
干的很漂亮 比我干的漂亮多了
'Lt was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.'

477
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:35,496
信號非常明顯 我要警告她
'The message was quite clear. I needed to warn her. '

478
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,137
快接 快接 快接
Come on, come on, come on.

479
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,613
我四處尋找 我在飛機場找不到她
'I couldn't find her at the airport.

480
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,575
我甚至查了一遍航班表...
'I even look ed through all the flight lists and...

481
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,028
我跑去了碼頭
'I headed down to the harbour.

482
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,375
他們把她帶上了去敖德薩的船
'They put her on a ship to Odessa.

483
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,550
我就知道這些了
'That's all I know.'

484
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,186
我已經...
I've...

485
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,567
我已經盡了全部的努力 史邁利先生 但是...
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr Smiley, but...

486
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,164
我就是... 情不自禁地一直想著她
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.

487
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,549
她根本就不是我喜歡的類型
She wasn't even my type.

488
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,972
我想把她救出來 是我欠了她
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.

489
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,727
卡拉不會放過你
Karla will be looking for you.

490
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,646
有誰會放過我呢?
Everybody's looking for me.

491
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,439
你不可以留在這里
You can't stay here.

492
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,484
不安全
It isn't safe.

493
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:26,204
我說過 你可以上我的床 貝琳達 但是白天必須喊我長官
'I said, "You may fuck me but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning."'

494
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:31,755
知道了 就是來告訴你一聲
'OK. Just need to let you know.

495
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,876
上個星期有人用我們的掩護身份飛到了巴黎
'Someone flew into Paris last week on one of our escaped passports.'

496
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,346
-還有呢? -是里基·塔爾
'And? ' 'lt was Ricki Tarr.'

497
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,595
為什么要告訴我?
'Why are you telling me? '

498
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,686
-不過是巧合... -你這個臭侏儒
- 'Lt could be coincidence... ' - 'You are a poisoned dwarf.

499
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,304
為什么不死去找大臣呢?
'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

500
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,773
別想把我拉進你們的小丑團
'and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret? '

501
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:57,026
伊斯特哈斯先生 也許是巧合 但是...
'Mr Esterhase: "It could be coincidence but..."

502
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,826
海頓先生打斷了對話
'Mr Haydon interrupting.

503
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,616
你真是個臭侏儒 托比
"'You really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.

504
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,573
為什么不死去找大臣呢?
"'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

505
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,201
別想把我拉進你們的小丑團
"'and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?"'

506
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,431
你樣子很疲憊
You look tired.

507
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,682
睡得不好
I didn't sleep well.

508
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,149
我想要你幫我拿點東西 彼得
You're going to do something for me, Peter.

509
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,650
我需要值班室去年11月的登記簿
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.

510
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,573
我不得不讓你跑一趟樓上的虎穴
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions' den.

511
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,457
如果你被抓到了
If you're caught,

512
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,091
不能把我供出來

513
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,714
很抱歉 不過你得孤身奮戰
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

514
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,711
-去年11月的? -嗯
- Last November? - Hm.

515
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,605

- Oh, Christ! - Telephone, sir.

544
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,183
-誰啊? -外線電話 先生 說話聲沙啞
- Who is it? - Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

545
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,903
先生?
Sir?

546
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,321
-喂? -你的齒輪箱廢掉了
- Hello? - (Mendel) 'Your gearbox is bust, sir.'

547
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,785
去他媽 你就不能去修一修嗎?
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

548
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,028
沒法修了
'Can't be done, sir.

549
01:03:55,384 --> 01:03:57,542
恐怕你要換一個新的齒輪箱

550
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:01,202
好歹先找一下經銷商 你有他們的號碼嗎?
Well, phone the main dealership first. Have you got their number?

551
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,418
沒有
'No.'

552
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,538
別掛線 阿爾文!
Hang on. Alwyn!

553
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,129
-阿爾文 -在

554
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,717
包遞給我 可以嗎?
Get me my bag, will you?

555
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,586
-但是... -就一下子
- But... - J ust for a second.

556
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,100
謝了
Thank you.

557
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,722
別掛線
Hang on.

558
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,248
-喂? -我聽著
- Hello? - 'I'm listening.'

559
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:43,665
-嗯 9-4-6 0-3-3-5 -記好了 先生
- Yes. 9-4-60-3-3-5. - 'Be right on it, sir.'

560
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,287
謝謝
Thank you.

561
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,383
彼得·吉勒姆
Peter Guillam.

562
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,050
你還真是難找啊
Could we see you, please?

563
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,138
潘西有急事跟你說
Percy would lik e quite an urgent word with you.

564
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,179
你現在去一下六樓 幫幫忙
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.

565
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,768
行 沒問題
Yes, of course.

566
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,765
你替我把那玩意兒扔到電梯里去
Throw that into the lift for me.

567
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,438
把它送上三樓 省得我一直寫那些煩人的單子
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.

568
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,231
遵命 先生
Will do, sir.

569
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,132
你最近這些日子都在忙些什么呢...
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?

570
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,547
都在忙著泡妞吧
Apart from chasing our virgins.

571
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,048
有幾個阿拉伯人看起來挺靠譜的
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.

572
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,435
除此之外 乒乓球也打的不錯
Apart from that, I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

573
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,395
阿拉伯人
Arabs.

574
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,140
你可以租一個但是不能買下來 對吧 比爾?
You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right, Bill?

575
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,487
里基·塔爾最近怎么樣了?
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

576
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,528
還行 我們每天下午都在福特納喝茶
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.

577
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,158
我要知道你跟塔爾的談話內容
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.

578
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,452
我會跟他說的 他會很高興的
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

579
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,166
聳什么肩啊你?
What's that shrug for?

580
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,050
我跟你說的是你那個賣國賊
I'm talking to you about the traitor

581
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,675
那個在伊斯坦布爾殺了我們的人的賣國賊
who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.

582
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,144
我說的是你那個爛部門的叛徒!
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.

583
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:29,186
我現在追究的是 你背著我勾結敵方的特工!
I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.

584
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,651
別他媽對我聳肩
Don't damn well shrug at me!

585
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,737
你想坐牢嗎?
How would you lik e a term in prison?

586
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,535
我現在已經不跟他見面了
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

587
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,839
你好好弄清楚事實 少跟我?嗦!
So get your facts straight and get off my back!

588
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,801
那我告訴你 塔爾最近剛到巴黎
So... if I told you Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

589
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,716
你意外不?
would you be surprised?

590
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,009
塔爾做什么都不會讓我意外
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.

591
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:05,890
如果我告訴你 我們查到
And if I told you we happen to know ?0,000 mysteriously appeared

592
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,273
上個月有一筆3萬英鎊的資金

593
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,263
神奇地出現在他的銀行賬戶呢
in his bank account last month,

594
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,731
讓你驚喜不?
would that surprise you?

595
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,986
你的人是叛徒 吉勒姆
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

596
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,485
幾個月前被敵方收買了 現在他們把人送回來
Turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us.

597
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,409
-什么目的? -別管什么目的
- What for? - Never mind what for.

598
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,079
要我們雞犬不寧 那就是目的
To muddy the water, that's what for.

599
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:32,124
放一組煙霧彈耍得我們團團轉!
To spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

600
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,667
現在關鍵是
The point is this.

601
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,381
他要回來了
He's heading for home.

602
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:38,983
你要是一看到他 立馬給大人們報告

603
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,635
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.

604
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,469
明白嗎?
Understood?

605
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:44,136
現在在座的哪一位都可以 但不能對別的人透露!
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.

606
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,557
出去
Get out.

607
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,395
彼得?
Peter?

608
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,610
謝謝你 貝琳達
Thank you, Belinda.

609
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,035
# Oh, Mr Wu

610
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,911
# What shall I do?

611
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,169
# Oh, Mr Wu

612
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,092
# What shall I do?

613
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,760
# Mr Wu... #

614
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,399
一切順利嗎?
All go smoothly, did it?

615
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,314
我要去旅館見史邁利
I need to go to the hotel to see George.

616
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,439
史邁利先生不在酒店 改地點了
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.

617
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,827
喬治?
George?

618
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,257
吉勒姆先生...
Mr Guillam...

619
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,424
抱歉 我拖了那么久才回來
Sorry it took me so long to come home.

620
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,446
里基一直在幫我們 彼得
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

621
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,657
他告訴了我們他所有的冒險經歷
He's been telling us all about his adventures.

622
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,694
他是個雙面間諜! 喬治!
He's a double, George.

623
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,788
根本沒有地鼠!
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.

624
01:09:29,228 --> 01:09:31,001
整件事就是莫斯科那邊編出來的謊言

625
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,158
卡拉花三萬英鎊收買了他!
Karla bought him for ?0,000.

626
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,161
我偷這個 就因為你
I stole that because of you.

627
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,881
就因為他 弄得我自己監視自己
I spied on my own because of him. Do you know how that mak es me feel?

628
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,229
你知道我是什么感覺嗎?

629
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,249
里基...
Ricki...

630
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:45,004
你說你給圓場發了一封提及伊琳娜身份的電報?
you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information.

631
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,050
-沒錯 -哪一天?
- That's right. - What was the date?

632
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,174
他不會知道 因為根本就沒有電報
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.

633
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,802
-整件事都是編出來的 -11月20日
- The whole thing is a fabrication. - 20th November.

634
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,022
肯定是11月20號 傍晚的時候
It must have been 20th November. Evening.

635
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,687
'lrina k ept telling me in Moscow Centre

636
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,357
'everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

637
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:05,232
11月20號這一頁沒了
- 'She told me Karla... ' - November 20th is missing.

638
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:09,361
有人藏起了自己的記錄 難道你覺得
Someone is covering their track s, unless of course you think

639
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,362
這只是巧合?
that's just a coincidence?

640
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:17,084
那錢是怎么回事?
What about the money?

641
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,081
能換得他的地鼠的安全 3萬英鎊對卡拉來說不算什么
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.

642
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,507
恐怕圓場里有人知道了塔爾先生的事
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr Tarr

643
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,597
然后 用盡方法想誣陷他
and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

644
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,140
'... everything the Circus think s is gold is shit, made in Moscow.'

645
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,728
為什么不告訴我 你已經找到塔爾?
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?

646
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,571
萬一我在圓場失手了
In case I never made it out of the Circus.

647
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,166
我要休息一會兒

648
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,783
到時候你應該也看完了吧
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

649
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,835
上來
Come up.

650
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,799
我見過他一次
I met him once.

651
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,761
卡拉
Karla.

652
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,806
在55年的時候
In '55.

653
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,273
莫斯科中心四分五裂
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

654
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,491
大量的清洗行動
Purge after purge.

655
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,986
他們一半的特工外逃
Half their agents were jumping ship.

656
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,664
我四處奔走 把他們攬回來
I travelled around, signing them up.

657
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,662
幾百號人呢
Hundreds of them.

658
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,169
其中有一個人管自己叫格茨曼
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.

659
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,335
他在回俄羅斯的路上
He was on his way back to Russia

660
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:52,930
我們很確定他將會被處死
and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.

661
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:57,553
飛機在德里停留了24小時 就在那段時間里
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had

662
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,805
我必需說服他投奔我們
to convince him to come over to us

663
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,024
別回去送死
instead of going home to die.

664
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,489
一個很小的房間里...
There's a little room.

665
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,621
我坐這兒 他坐那兒
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

666
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,670
美國人對他施了刑
The Americans had had him tortured.

667
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,843
他已經沒有了指甲
He had no fingernails.

668
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,675
熱得要命
It's incredibly hot.

669
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:45,525
我很累 只想把這事了結了然后回家
I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home.

670
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,855
當時正跟安恩鬧矛盾
Things weren't going well with Ann.

671
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,451
我用老套路勸他..
I give him the usual pitch.

672
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:00,665
來西方吧 我們可以給你舒適的生活
"Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,

673
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,709
在審訊之后
"after questioning."

674
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,548
他怎么說?
What did he say?

675
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,513
想想你的妻子
"Think of your wife.

676
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,347
你有妻子吧?
"You have a wife, don't you?

677
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,729
還有 我給你帶了點香煙
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.

678
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,569
用我的打火機吧
"Use my lighter.

679
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:43,954
我們可以安排她與你團聚
"We could arrange for her to join you. We have a lot of stock to trade.

680
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:44,171
我們有一大批囤貨可以交易

681
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,163
要是你回去 她會被流放 為她考慮考慮吧
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her.

682
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,006
想想...
"Think about..."

683
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,255
我一直...
I kept on...

684
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,975
...說老婆的事兒
...harping on about the damn wife,

685
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,604
之后跟他說了很多我自己的事...
telling him more about me than...

686
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,277
其實我早該起身離去
I should have walk ed out, of course.

687
01:14:13,794 --> 01:14:18,080
但是出于某種原因 我覺得救出這個人很重要

688
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,532
我跟你其實沒有太多的不一樣
"We're not so very different you and I.

689
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,826
你和我花了一輩子時間
"We've both spent our lives

690
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,296
來尋找對方制度上的弱點
"looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.

691
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,668
難道你不覺得是時候承認
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

692
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:40,265
你的一方和我的一方都是沒有東西值得我們賣命的嗎?
"there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"

693
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,480
沒說一句話
Never said a word.

694
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,829
一個字都沒說
Not one word.

695
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,716
第二天早上他坐飛機回去了
And the next morning he got back on his plane.

696
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,008
把那包煙還給了我 沒有碰過
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.

697
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,180
這個老煙槍
This was a chain-smok er, mind.

698
01:15:23,677 --> 01:15:28,692
懷著必死的心飛走了

699
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:28,520
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.

700
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,230
他留著我的打火機
He k ept my lighter.

701
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,823
那是一份禮物
It was a gift.

702
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,161
“給喬治 安恩贈”
"To George from Ann.

703
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,449
“我的最愛”
"All my love."

704
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,287
他就是卡拉?
That was Karla.

705
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,258
他寧愿飛回去送死也不愿意投降?
He went back to die rather than giving in.

706
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,882
嗯 也就是這一次 我知道了他不是不可戰勝的
Yes, and that's how I k now he can be beaten.

707
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,062
他是個狂熱分子
Because he's a fanatic.

708
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,477
狂熱分子總是隱藏著猜疑
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.

709
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,900
他長什么樣?
What did he look lik e?

710
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,120
我記不起來了
I can't remember.

711
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,887
今天以后 彼得
After today, Peter,

712
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,773
你要小心他們在監視你
you have to assume they're watching you.

713
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,693
想想還有什么東西要收拾
If there's anything you need tidied up,

714
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,029
趁現在
now is the time.

715
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,129
快好了
Nearly done.

716
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,223
For God's sak e.

717
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,561
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.

718
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,861
如果你有了別人 可以坦白告訴我
If there's someone else, you can tell me.

719
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,244
我是成年人了
I'm a grown-up.

720
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:34,453
我知道 這是一個快樂的圣誕節
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.

721

抱歉
Excuse me.

722
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,633
# And I was too proud to give in

723
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:58,227
# I had to learn the hard way

724
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,563
彼得 你準備好了

732
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,706

01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,712
我覺得老總瘋了
I thought it was madness.

817
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:55,263
我知道是他們五個中的一個
I know that it is one of five men.

818
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,601
你只需要告訴我他們的代號
All I want from you is one code name.

819
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,026
阿勒萊恩
Alleline.

820
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,901
鍋匠
Tink er.

821
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,078
海頓
Haydon.

822
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,448
裁縫
Tailor.

823
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,618
布蘭德
Bland.

824
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,622
士兵
Soldier.

825
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,885
我們不用“水手” 因為與“裁縫”的發音太接近
We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.

826
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,174
“富人”好像不太適合
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.

827
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,682
伊斯特哈斯
Esterhase.

828
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,887
窮人?
Poor Man.

829
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,935
還有第五個?
And the fifth?

830
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,731
史邁利
Smiley.

831
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,699
這想法太瘋了
I thought it was madness.

832
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:01,241
竟然覺得你是他們其中的一個
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.

833
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,499
徹底地瘋了
Absolute madness.

834
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,341
但你還是去了
'But you still went.

835
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,585
為什么?
'Why? '

836
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,884
我去 是因為老總叫我去
'I went because Control ask ed me to go.

837
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,507
我是履行職責
'Lt's called doing one's duty.

838
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:33,524
我在車站與那個帶我去見將軍的跑腿碰面
'At the station I met the legman supposed to tak e me to the General.

839
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,651
侍應生被嚇壞了
'The waiter must have panick ed.

840
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,698
本來是一個簡單的小任務
'Lt was meant to be a simple snatch job.

841
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,995
他們把我送到了軍方醫院
'They drove me to some military hospital,

842
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,919
然后押上了運輸機
'and then put me on a transport plane.

843
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,337
一開始的時候我還分得清我們向著東方走
'I could tell by the stars we were heading east.

844
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,928
我們一直審我...
'Then they work ed me for...

845
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:03,762
...不知道審多久了
'... I don't know how long.

846
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,106
幾個星期 或許幾個月
'Week s, maybe months.'

847
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,227
你跟他們說什么了?
What did you tell them?

848
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,359
所有的事
Everything.

849
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:57,616
我盡全力堅持著 為所有人爭取時間逃出匈牙利
I held on for as long as I could to let everyone get the hell out of there.

850
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,198
他們有逃掉嗎?
Did they?

851
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:05,161
我的人都在匈牙利 他們逃出去了嗎?
My network s in H ungary, did they get out?

852
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,999
沒有 他們被端了
No, they were blown.

853
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,880
傳聞說你為了自保 把他們都供出來了
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.

854
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:28,430
他們審完了以后 有個小個子就出現了
'After the interrogators had cleared out, this little fellow turned up.

855
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,441
看上去像個神父
'Look ed lik e a priest.

856
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,321
那才是來真格的
'That's when they really started on me.'

857
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:40,067
你最后的防線是什么?
What was your last line of defence, hm?

858
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,324
地鼠
The mole.

859
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,824
老總的瘋狂理論
Control's crazy theory.

860
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:52,416
我一直深埋著 他們決不會從我這兒套出來的
I was going to bury that so deep they'd never get it out of me.

861
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,209
-結果卻成了笑話 -為什么?
- Which was a jok e. - Why?

862
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,254
因為他們早就知道
Because they already knew.

863
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:04,929
他們想知道的是老總調查到哪一步了
All they wanted to know was how far Control had got in his investigation.

864
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:22,488
不 我不認識她
No, I don't know her.

865
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:46,091
他們問了我什么事嗎?
Did they ask about me at all?

866
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,717
有
Yes.

867
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,721
那個小個子問了
The little fellow did.

868
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,896
他說了我什么?
What did he say about me?

869
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,730
他拿著個香煙打火機
He had this cigarette lighter.

870
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,901
他拿著打火機我面前晃來晃去
He k ept flashing it about for me to see it.

871
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,404
把題詞給我看
Showed me the inscription.

872
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,747
“給喬治 ...” “安恩贈”
- "To George..." - "...from Ann.

873
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:12,917
“我的最愛”
"All my love."

874
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:20,258
是卡拉
Karla.

875
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,162
很奇怪
'lt was odd.

876
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,211
他們把我送回了英格蘭
'They sent me back to England.

877
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,922
直接到沙拉特匯報情況 （沙拉特：圓場培訓新特務的機構，位于沙拉特）
'Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.'

878
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,714
他說他脫身后 在護理院受審的時候 有一個人找過他
He said when he was being debriefed at the N ursery, he had a visitor.

879
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:09,011
誰?
Who?

880
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:12,011
托比·伊斯特哈斯
'Toby Esterhase.

881
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,809
他給了吉姆一千鎊 和一輛阿爾維斯
'He gave him ?1,000 and an Alvis.'

882
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:19,192
叫他就此人間蒸發別再回來
Told him he was dead now. Couldn't come back.

883
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,812
像喝了孟婆湯一樣 忘掉所有發生過的事情
Had to become a lotus eater, forget everything that happened.

884
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,814
包括老總的那套說法
Control's theory.

885
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,158
鍋匠 裁縫... 所有所有
Tink er, Tailor. All of it.

886
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,196
這正是我不解的地方
Yes, that's what I thought.

887
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:35,621
伊斯特哈斯究竟是如何得知“鍋匠 裁縫”的呢?
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tink er, Tailor?

888
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,435
伊琳娜老是跟我說起 在莫斯科中心里
'lrina k ept telling me in Moscow Centre

889
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,897
大人物們那些笑得止不住的笑聲
'everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

890
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,438
她說卡拉非常為之驕傲
'She told me Karla was very proud of this.

891
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,778
圓場視為金礦的東西不過是垃圾 全是來自莫斯科
'She said everything the Circus think s is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

892
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:11,528
伊琳娜老是跟我說起 在莫斯科中心里
'Lrina k ept telling me in Moscow Centre

893
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:14,576
大人物們那些笑得止不住的笑聲
'everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

894
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,917
不 我知道附近有家旅館 他們有幾個小房子
'No, I had a hotel nearby. They do have some seedy rooms.

895
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,082
伊琳娜老是跟我說起 在莫斯科中心里
'Lrina k ept telling me in Moscow Centre

896
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:23,753
大人物們那些笑得止不住的笑聲
'everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

897
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,796
她說卡拉非常為之驕傲...
'She told me Karla was very proud of this... '

898
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:04,835
“圓場視為金礦的東西不過是垃圾”
'She said everything the Circus think s is gold is shit.'

899
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:38,331
不開會了 說的夠清楚沒?
This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?

900
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,117
很清楚 大臣
Perfectly, Minister.

901
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:51,007
在城里的某座宅子
There is a house somewhere in this city

902
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,849
是阿勒萊恩和其他幾個人 跟“巫術”的倫敦代表碰頭的地方
where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative.

903
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,093
我以為拉康跟你說得夠明白了
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.

904
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:01,847
“巫術”的事你別插手!
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.

905
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:03,814
我就是遵照著拉康的意思辦事
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

906
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,525
是你讓我跟老總的足跡調查下去
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.

907
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:11,318
我不管是誰的意思 老總給我們丟下這么個該死的爛攤子
I wouldn't consider that sound advice, given the mess Control left us with.

908
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:16,661
害得阿勒萊恩 不妨直說 還害我
It has tak en Alleline and, if I may say so, myself

909
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,825
花了多少時間才讓圓場重新走上正軌
this long to get us back in the game.

910
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:23,960
阿勒萊恩和其余幾個人要見的人正是波里雅科夫
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyak ov.

911
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:31,765
你以為他負責把“巫術情報”送到你手上

912
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:31,551
'From Witchcraft to you.

913
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,548
而實際上他是負責把地鼠的情報
'His real role is to receive information from the mole

914
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,265
送回給卡拉
'to tak e back to Karla.'

915
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:43,058
這...這不可能
That, er... That's not possible.

916
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,806
有可能
Made possible.

917
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:48,355
有你幫忙說服財政部支付了宅子的費用
By you in the house you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.

918
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:54,449
“巫術情報”千真萬確 是金礦啊!
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine. It's been gold.

919
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:58,866
看似誘人 其實都是雞毛蒜皮的東西
It's just enough glitter amongst the chick en feed.

920
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:01,865
老總不相信奇跡 也不相信“巫術”
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.

921
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,741
但因為你的怠慢失職和貪婪
But you were lazy and greedy

922
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:07,962
就想方設法趕他出局 從而讓卡拉趁虛而入
and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

923
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:14,885
你們已經跟美方展開談判 磋商交換情報的事宜
You opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans.

924
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,677
他們給圓場的情報也會一字不落去到克里姆林宮
What they tell the C ircus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.

925
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:24,271
“巫術”提供的所謂“金礦”情報
Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have,

926
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,515
他想引誘上鉤的不是你
it wasn't to lure you.

927
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:28,892
而是美國佬
It was to lure the Americans.

928
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,778
現在
Now,

929
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,023
你還想邀功嗎?
do you want to tak e credit for that?

930
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,404
我們能怎么辦?
What can we do?

931
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:47,623
我們手里有一樣地鼠想要的東西
We have one thing the mole wants.

932
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,173
-如果要我去巴黎... -你要去...
- If I go to Paris... - You'll go.

933
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:55,088
如果要我...去巴黎
If I go to Paris,

934
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,339
我要你們保證把伊琳娜帶回來
I want your word that you will get Irina back.

935
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:04,477
我不管你們拿誰去換 反正我不玩了
I don't care who you have to trade. And I am out.

936
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:11,313
我想要一個家 我才不想落得你們這些人的下場...
I want a family, thank you. I do not want to end up lik e you lot.

937
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:13,732
你們把她帶回來
You will get her back.

938
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:19,108
我會盡力的 里基
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

939
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:46,261
噢 你好 喬治
Oh, hello, George.

940
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,854
你好
Hello.

941
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,212
我想跟你談談忠誠 托比
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

942
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,215
老總招你進來的 是不是?
Control recruited you, didn't he?

943
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,514
他看你在維也納一個博物館里挨餓
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.

944
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:29,183
還是通緝犯
A wanted man.

945
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,351
聽說他救了你一命
Saved your life, I heard.

946
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,643
然而 到了關鍵時刻
And yet when the time came,

947
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,191
讓你在老總和阿勒萊恩之間作選擇的時候
when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline,

948
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:39,234
你就沒猶豫過?
you didn't hesitate.

949
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:44,035
或許這能歸因于你經歷過戰爭
That's understandable, perhaps, with your war experience.

950
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:48,907
這么多年來你能生存下來
You survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides.

951
01:40:46,209 --> 01:40:49,265
我想這跟你慧眼識主的能力不無關系

952
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,125
還真倒戈自如啊
Serve any master.

953
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,466
這話... 這話從何說起呀 喬治?
What? What's... What's this about, George?

954
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:03,797
從你改投哪方陣營說起 托比
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.

955
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,428
情報泄露了 托比
'I ntelligence has been leak ed, Toby.

956
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:13,432
有人一直從圓場盜取情報
'Someone's been taking files from the Circus.

957
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,775
不 不 不 不 不
'No, no, no, no. No.'

958
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,643
這是個誤會 你誤解了
This is a mistak e, a misunderstanding.

959
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,238
文件都交給了一個蘇聯外交參事 是不是?
Files were delivered to a Russian attach? weren't they?

960
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:22,482
是的
Yes.

961
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:27,032
我也承認是我送出去的
'And, yes, I delivered them.'

962
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:34,828
但潘西也有份
'But so did Percy Alleline.'

963
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:40,959
好孩子
Good boy.

964
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,211
比爾
'Bill Haydon.

965
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:47,056
還有羅埃·布蘭德
'And so did Roy Bland.'

966
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,352
有些事并非如我們想象中那樣 喬治
Things aren't always what they seem, George.

967
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,479
你是知道的
You should know that.

968
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,028
蘇聯當局以為波里雅科夫...
Look, Moscow think s Polyak ov's...

969
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:10,283
...是在為他們效力
...working for them.

970
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:12,907
所以我們時不時給他點無關重要的情報帶回去充數
Every now and then we give him the odd file to tak e back to them.

971
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,456
都是些雞毛蒜皮的情報 算是給他上司的交代
Chick en feed, just to k eep his bosses happy.

972
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:21,124
但其實波里雅科夫是我們的人
But Polyak ov's our Joe.

973
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,969
-是一項大行動的關鍵人物 -你指“巫術行動”嗎?
- He's a part of a big operation. - Operation Witchcraft.

974
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:27,467
這個我知道
Yes, I know.

975
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:30,091
喬治
George.

976
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:33,014
-拜托 我不該受到這樣的待遇 -是誰派你去見吉姆
- Please, I don't deserve this. - Who gave you the message

977
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,889
叫他忘掉“鍋匠裁縫”的事?
for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tink er, Tailor?

978
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,357
-布蘭德 -那么鏟除康妮·沙赫斯的事呢?
- Bland. - To get rid of Connie Sachs?

979
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:40,192
-威斯特貝呢? -布蘭德
- Westerby? - Bland.

980
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:42,528
也許是海頓
Or Haydon.

981
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:44,488
我不記得了 反正他們其中一個
I don't know. One of them.

982
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,566
也可能是潘西 不
Or maybe Percy. No.

983
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:50,410
我不知道是誰
Well, I don't know who.

984
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:52,746
你只是個信差
You're just the messenger.

985
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:56,450
在他們之間跑來跑去
Running between them all.

986
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,044
你有為“巫師”效力嗎?
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

987
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,707
我非常清楚你們的終極秘密
I know all about your secret source.

988
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,548
我也知道你所不知道的
And I know something you don't.

989
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:10,718
我知道他是誰
I know who he is.

990
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:15,186
他就是卡拉
He's Karla.

991
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:27,361
你們中有人給了波里雅科夫貨真價實的機密情報
'One of you has been giving Polyak ov the crown jewels. '

992
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,610
-我不知情 -你還在通緝名單上嗎? 托比
- I did not know. - Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

993
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:34,614
-看 喬治 我真不知情 我... -你站錯隊了
- Look, George, I didn't know. I... - You pick ed the wrong side.

994
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,615
你得相信我 我絕不會...
No, you've got to believe me.

995
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:39,084
喬治 別
George, please.

996
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,378
我是忠誠的!
I am loyal.

997
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:48,503
我... 我是忠誠的!
I... I am loyal.

998
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:01,979
不要... 不要... 不要送我回去
Don't... Don't... Don't send me back.

999
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:03,976
不要 喬治
Please, George.

1000
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,604
不要送我回去
Don't send me back.

1001
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:14,203
把地址給我
Give me the address.

1002
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,830
你們與波里雅科夫見面的地點
Where do you meet Polyak ov?

1003
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,758
嘿 嘿! 乖狗狗 別吵!
Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!

1004
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:39,641
怎么回事? 你是誰?
What is this? Who are you?

1005
01:44:39,995 --> 01:44:41,862
-麥克雷格太太? -是的

1006
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,786
-安全信號是什么? -通風管道
- What are the safety signals? - The air vent.

1007
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,285
打開的話表示一切正常 關閉則表示不能內進
Open and all's well, closed and you're not to enter.

1008
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:08,169
竊聽器在哪兒?
And the microphone?

1009
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,465
彼得?
Peter?

1010
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:36,069
“男孩站在燃燒的甲板上 除他外無人生還”
The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled

1011
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:38,662
“火焰照亮了戰爭的殘骸 火光中他孤零零地站在尸體堆中”
The flame that lit the battle's wreck shone brightly o'er the dead

1012
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,992
“他的身影卻是那樣絕美而明亮 命中注定駕馭暴風之上”
'Beautiful and proud he stood as born to rule the storm

1013
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:46,370
“血肉之軀 雖然渺小 卻為之驕傲”
'A creature of blood, a proud though child-lik e form'

1014
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:49,169
“火焰在翻騰...”
- The flames rolled on...

1015
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:03,266
謝謝 再見
Merci. Au revoir.

1016
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,971
繼續
Go on.

1017
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,891
局里出動了全部人馬在找你
The whole service is looking for you.

1018
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:51,394
他們找到你非活剝了你的皮不可
- They'll skin you alive if they find you. - Maybe I want them to find me.

1019
01:46:50,053 --> 01:46:52,242
或許我希望他們找到我

1020
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:56,278
你可以回家了 把書放回原處 鑰匙插到機子里
You can go now. Leave the book s and put the k eys in the machines.

1021
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:59,072
不 本 你留下
No, Ben stays here.

1022
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:04,574
里基·塔爾聲稱手中有更多關系圓場安危的情報
Ricki Tarr claims to have information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1023
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,768
史邁利先生?
'Mr Smiley? '

1024
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:32,601
有計程車駛進圓場
Taxi approaching Circus.

1025
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:46,452
鍋匠
Tink er.

1026
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:59,174
裁縫
Tailor.

1027
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,218
這個是士兵
Here comes Soldier.

1028
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:12,600
人齊了
'Full house.'

1029
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:31,207
好 繼續 大聲念出來
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud. - "Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1030
01:48:27,045 --> 01:48:31,425
“阿勒萊恩致塔爾的私人信息”

1031
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:36,673
“在滿足你的請求前我們需要澄清”
"Require clarification before meeting your request.

1032
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:43,844
“前引號 更多關系圓場安危的情報 后引號”
"Quote, information vital to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

1033
01:48:45,144 --> 01:48:49,387
“不足以說明情況 需提供更多的情報”
"does not qualify, send further information."

1034
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:52,606
這就對了嘛 姓潘西的 你就拖延時間吧
Ah! That's it, Percy, you k eep stalling.

1035
01:48:52,735 --> 01:48:55,568
我得警告你 本 園場里有奸細
I warn you, Ben. We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.

1036
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,937
你誰都不能輕信
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1037
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,034
“會議結束”
'The meeting's over.

1038
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:12,372
“他們要走了”
'They're leaving.'

1039
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,952
克拉道克斯說我不用幾天就可以離開了
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1040
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:21,492
我一直在想 在莫斯科我會有多惦念板球這游戲啊
I k eep thinking how much I'm going to miss the crick et in Moscow.

1041
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:32,678
我很希望你能幫我跑跑腿
I was rather hoping you might do a little light housek eeping for me.

1042
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:36,135
我會盡力的
If I can.

1043
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:41,478
有個女孩 你能替我給她點錢么?
There's a girl. Give her some money, would you?

1044
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:43,813
幫我編個故事
And give her a good cover story.

1045
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:48,861
如果能讓她好過點 就跟她說我愛她
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1046
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,695
全在那兒了
It's all there.

1047
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:54,908
還有個男孩 給他塞點堵口費
And there's a boy, too. Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1048
01:53:57,247 --> 01:54:01,331
我太清楚審訊人慣用的伎倆了
I know the inquisitors' bag of trick s. I taught most of them.

1049
01:53:59,638 --> 01:54:01,828
他們幾乎都是我教出來的

1050
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,998
我有點激動
It's just a reaction.

1051
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:10,503
也許是太激動了 隨便你怎么想
An over-reaction, if you lik e.

1052
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:13,342
我有一兩個問題
I did have one or two questions.

1053
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,049
-關于普萊多的 -該死!
- About Prideaux. - Goddamn it!

1054
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:22,098
-是我把他救回來的 不是嗎? -沒錯 是你
- I got him back, didn't I? - Yes, yes, you did.

1055
01:54:22,453 --> 01:54:24,403
那是你的功勞

1056
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:28,517
我很意外卡拉居然沒有斃了他
I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.

1057
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:32,817
還是你覺得
Or do you think he held back,

1058
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:35,737
他之所以退縮是出于對你的微妙情感?

1059
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:35,531
out of delicacy towards you?

1060
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:43,825
普萊多赴匈牙利執行任務前是不是去找過你?
Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1061
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,712
沒錯 事實就是這樣
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1062
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,376
為了說什么嗎?
To say what?

1063
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,715
為了警告你
To warn you.

1064
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:05,228
因為他心知肚明
Because he knew deep down

1065
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:08,397
那個人從始至終就是你
it was you all along.

1066
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:15,192
你也一樣
So did you.

1067
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,616
我不得不選擇立場 喬治
I had to pick a side, George.

1068
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:26,579
這是個兩難的抉擇 差不多就是個道德難題
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.

1069
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:31,004
西方國家越來越丑惡
And the West has become so very ugly.

1070
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:33,874
你不覺得嗎?
Don't you think?

1071
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:39,179
卡拉有沒有想過讓你接管圓場?
Did Karla ever consider having you tak e over the Circus?

1072
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,639
我才不是他的走卒!
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1073
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:44,259
那你是什么呢? 比爾
What are you, then, Bill?

1074
01:55:50,902 --> 01:55:53,143
我就是一個功成名就的人
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1075
01:56:06,918 --> 01:56:11,582
有什么需要我幫你帶給安恩的嗎?
Is there anything particular you want me to pass on to Ann?

1076
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:19,837
喔 那只是工作需要 喬治 我想你應該能明白的
Oh, that was nothing personal, George. I hope you understand that.

1077
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:22,339
卡拉說你是個厲害角色
Karla said you were good,

1078
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:25,593
不容小覷
the one we had to worry about.

1079
