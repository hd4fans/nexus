1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,496
# Hey, Mister Tambourine Man #

2
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,541
# Play a song for me #

3
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,587
- # In the jingle-jangle morning... # - "B."

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,965
- # I'll come following... # - "A."

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,884
Man: You having fun, sweetheart?

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,053
Girl: Yes.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,847
Ahh.

8
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,850
Well, I hope you're doing better than me, baby.

9
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,436
- What are you making? - A necklace for Mom.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,688
Yeah? Let me see.

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,066
Wow. Another one?

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,693
- Yes. - Woman: Honey?

13
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,528
That's two today.

14
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,405
- Yeah. - Yeah.

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,990
Honey?

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,785
- Yeah? - Waiting for the help to get that?

17
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,704
I thought you and I were the help.

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,793
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin. - Okay.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,420
Mmm, smells nice. That takeout?

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,965
Mommy, look at-

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,850
No!

22
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,353
No! Ahh!

23
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,027
Oh! No no no!

24
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,655
You can't fight fate.

25
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,253
Man: We gotta get the fuck out of here. Come on!

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,882
Oh! Oh no!

27
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,304
Thug: No!

28
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,182
- What the fuck are you doing? - No!

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,643
Fucking stop! Let's go!

30
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,812
Just shut the fuck up!

31
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,154
No!

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,664
It's cool.

33
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,332
Kids like me.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,502
No! Heather!

35
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,049
No no!

36
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,400


37
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,691
- Nick. - Bray, what's happenin'?

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,111
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine. Where are we on his kid's case?

39
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,696
- Willis? - Yeah.

40
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,615
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie. - Why did you do that?

41
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,700
'Cause the case was a dog. The kid was only 15 years old

42
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,494
when he committed the murder.

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,497
You wouldn't want to jeopardize your 95% conviction rate.

44
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,624
- It's actually 96%. - 96% now?

45
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,126
Yes. You gotta keep your books better than that.

46
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,673
You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were gunning for my job.

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,299
You do know better.

48
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,802
And you know that I'm aiming much higher than that.

49
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,513
Woman: They filed a motion to dismiss,

50
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,515
but there's no way that Judge Abrams honors it.

51
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,891
I think that we can get him on RICO.

52
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,560
All that time and that's what you come back with, Sarah?

53
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,563
You might want to reevaluate your research skills.

54
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,565
- What else have we got? - Nick: She's right.

55
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,858
Mr. Rice?

56
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,485
RICO's designed for this kind of thing.

57
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,071
Check out section 901 of the Organized Crime Control Act.

58
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,448
And you should let Sarah try this case too.

59
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,618
Mr. Rice, last I checked, I was running this room.

60
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,121
She's already done the leg-work. I'll oversee it.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,081
I mean, Helen Keller could try this case.

62
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,836
Okay, Boy Wonder, she fucks up, it's on you.

63
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,927
Cantrell wants to see you.

64
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,387
All right, I'll be right there.

65
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,057
No, Nick. He wants to see Nick.

66
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,768
You still torturing Bringham?

67
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,146
Nick: Let's just say I'm less impressed with his Harvard degree than he is.

68
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,647
Well, we can't all have gone to Fordham.

69
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,065
I went to Fordham night school.

70
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,443
You know what I learned in Fordham night school?

71
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,902
Law school's got nothing to do with law.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,322
Guess you skipped the course on inter-office politics.

73
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,241
All I need is a jury to like me. Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

74
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,286
The Shelton case- where are we?

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,163
It went sideways last night- Judge Burch.

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,706
Ahh.

77
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,666
Bad news. What now?

78
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,544
- Let's make the deal. - They killed a little girl, Nick.

79
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,589
- It's an imperfect system. - And we its imperfect servants.

80
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,343
- However you could win this case. - No, can't take that chance.

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,137
Some justice is better than no justice at all.

82
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,306
You need to tell the husband.

83
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,683
Okay. That's part of my job.

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,811
Good, because he's waiting for you right now.

85
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,646
What?

86
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,825
- How are you doing? - Good. How are you doing?

87
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,578
Good. Sit. Sit.

88
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,247
Well, I didn't hear back from you

89
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,584
and made some notes on the case.

90
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,670
I had some good ideas.

91
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,506
Yeah, let me take a look at it.

92
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,884
Well, they're just-

93
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,517
I was gonna talk to you about those.

94
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,895
Do you trust me?

95
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,942
Do you trust me, Clyde?

96
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,694
Yeah, of course.

97
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,575
Darby has agreed to testify against Ames.

98
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,328
With Darby's testimony,

99
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,288
Ames will go to death row.

100
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,296
Um, what about- what about Darby then?

101
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,967
Darby will plead guilty to murder.

102
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,803
- In what degree? - Third.

103
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,431
He serves, what? Five years...

104
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,183
at best?

105
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,228
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

106
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,232
We had a setback. The judge ruled that the DNA was inadmissible.

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
- What? - Exclusionary rule.

108
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,362
The opposing counsel maneuvered it.

109
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,698
You said this part of the case was clear-cut.

110
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,366
We had the blood on his shirt-

111
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,201
It's covered under the same rule.

112
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,703
What about the rest of the forensic evidence?

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,498
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

114
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,087
Okay, that's okay. 'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

115
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,299
I saw them do it. I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

116
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,343
You blacked out, Clyde. Your testimony won't be reliable.

117
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,263
You get on the stand and the defense will tear you apart.

118
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,849
No no, the jury's gonna believe me though.

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,144
- Because it's the truth! We can- - We can lose.

120
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,063
And then we'd have nothing.

121
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,608
You will waste a whole year, spend millions of dollars,

122
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,693
and then both of them could end up going free.

123
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,405
Nick, both of them are guilty, especially Darby!

124
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,574
- You know that. - It's not what you know, Clyde.

125
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,160
It's what you can prove in court.

126
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,416
Please don't make a deal with this man.

127
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,627
Please don't make a deal with this man. He's a monster-

128
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,296
I'm sorry, the deal is done. I'm sorry.

129
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,298
I made the deal.

130
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,426
What? How could you do that?

131
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,180
This is just how the justice system works.

132
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,434
Listen, I know you don't think it right now,

133
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,354
but this is a victory for us.

134
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,276
Woman: Your office has certified this agreement?

135
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,694
Yes, Your Honor.

136
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,740
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights to share with the court today?

137
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,910
I'm a defense attorney, Your Honor. I don't have many of those.

138
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,166
No, Your Honor. No insights.

139
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,127
Good, then I trust that we can move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

140
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,798
unimpeded by continuances. A triaI date is imminent.

141
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,761
Yeah?

142
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,305
There's no cell phones in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

143
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,807
- We've been over this- - I'm sorry.

144
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,100
- and over this, over this...

145
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,936
Yeah, I had some exigent business I-

146
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,063
Next time it's mine.

147
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,736
- Ah, you married? - Excuse me?

148
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,905
Are you married?

149
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,035
Please fuck this up so I can destroy you.

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,876
I wish ill for no man,

151
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,714
but Ames deserves to suffer for what he did.

152
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,050
I mean, you can't fight fate, right?

153
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,266
Nick.

154
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,019
Cantrell: Once you make a decision, live with it- move on.

155
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,354
This job, your best asset's a short memory.

156
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,566
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other people out there doing that already.

157
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,984
Look, there's some of them right now.

158
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,112
Isn't this where you tell me some type of old fable

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,073
or wives' tale-

160
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,075
All right, all right, I got one.

161
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,161
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant to walk behind him

162
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,912
as he made his way through the Roman town square.

163
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,165
And this servant's only job

164
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,001
was to whisper in his ear when people praised him,

165
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,463
"You're only a man. You're only a man. "

166
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,048
- Okay, man? - Okay, man.

167
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,466
- Okay, man. - That's some bullshit.

168
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
That's good.

169
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,093
Nick: I don't think you even know what that story means.

170
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,387
You're missing the point, Nick. It doesn't matter what they say.

171
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,056
Okay, I got this now.

172
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,853
All right, ladies and gentlemen, one at a time, one at a time.

173
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,772
So you'll be seeking the death penalty?

174
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,940
- For Rupert Ames, we will be. - And for Darby?

175
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,610
He has pled guilty to murder, but he is a cooperating witness.

176
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,154
The DA's office has committed all of its resources

177
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,823
to ensure that justice will be served.

178
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,659
Woman: Did you make any kind of-

179
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,577
Man: Do you think this is a fair sentence for Darby?

180
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,125
I just wanted to say thanks for being in my corner.

181
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,295
It's nice when the system works, right?

182
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,589
Get away from me.

183
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,092
Officer: Move. Move.

184
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,349
Let's go.

185
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,298
- Nick? - Hey.

186
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,105
Nuh-uh, what happened?

187
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,524
What happened to what?

188
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,861
What's wrong?

189
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,198
You call my job boring. "C-"?

190
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,908
Yes.

191
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,163
Well... okay now...

192
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,206
you gonna tell me what's wrong?

193
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,918
Can I talk to my daughter for a little bit?

194
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,046
- Oh, please. No no no. - Gonna lay down.

195
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,549
Please?

196
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,843
First of all, this is your father speaking.

197
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,720
- Yeah, she didn't know that. - You never know.

198
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,681
I want you to stay in there as long as you can.

199
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,017
'cause there's a lot of crazy-ass people out here.

200
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,935
Language.

201
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,147
Your mother's a hardass, but-

202
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,565
I'm right here.

203
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,319
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to come out and be Daddy's little girl.

204
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,155
Woman: I want her to come out 'cause she's on my bladder.

205
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,157
Nick: Ahh!

206
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,786
Anybody seen my phone?

207
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,502
- Hey, have you seen my phone? - It's not strapped to your hand?

208
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,629
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

209
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,506
- Daddy? - Yeah?

210
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,132
You're not gonna have some of my French toast?

211
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,051
- French toast? You made French toast? - Mm-hmm.

212
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,095
I can't, honey. I'm running late.

213
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,514
Okay.

214
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,767
All right, here- Mmm.

215
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,560
- Mmm, that's good. - Thank you.

216
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,770
- You did this by yourself? - Mm-hmm.

217
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,647
I'm just gonna take this whole plate to work.

218
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,274
All right- no.

219
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,109
You're only 10 years old?

220
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,278
- You better than your mother. - I heard that.

221
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,031
Smells good in here. Your lifeline.

222
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,033
'Morning, baby. Give me a kiss.

223
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,245
Mmm! You going to your daughter's recitaI this afternoon?

224
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,124
Um, I thought you were gonna order the DVDs.

225
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,960
Video's not the same, Nick.

226
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,129
Mom, it's okay. Dad's got to work, I know.

227
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,174
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work. And what is Dad doing today?

228
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,009
- Lock up bad guys. - And why does he do that?

229
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,511
- To keep us safe. - Yeah.

230
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,597
She understands. 'Cause he wants us to be safe.

231
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,558
- Baby, get your cello. - All right.

232
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,768
- Thank you so much. - You're welcome.

233
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,813
- Little Julia Child. - Mmm.

234
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,525
You know she's 10 years old, right?

235
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,943
- You know that? - I know that.

236
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,653
She doesn't understand why you're never around.

237
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,822
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff- that's just talk to her.

238
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,657
Don't do this, come on.

239
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,534
I can't come today.

240
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,870
You know you have not been to one recitaI-

241
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,621
- How many has she had? - Enough.

242
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,124
Okay. Well, we'll get the video,

243
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,420
we'll sit down and we'll watch it together as a family.

244
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,714
I love you.

245
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,173
All right?

246
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,426
- Thank you for the toast. - Love you.

247
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,719
- Love you too! - Bye.

248
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,804
Love you.

249
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,848
Huh.

250
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,767
- So how's Chip? - It's Chester.

251
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,311
What happened to Chip? I liked Chip.

252
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,104
There is no Chip.

253
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,648
And now there's no Chester. He kept calling.

254
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,151
- Sarah, that's a good thing. - I know, but I kept cancelling.

255
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,153
My caseload's crazy.

256
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,989
You know you don't have to go to this if you don't want to.

257
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,700
Yeah, I do. I...

258
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,285
What's it like?

259
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,746
No biggie. Like watching somebody fall asleep.

260
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,915
Except for the not-waking-up part.

261
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,917
Does it bother you?

262
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,668
Not anymore.

263
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,759
Sarah, your legs are looking real good in those heels.

264
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,012
Fuck off.

265
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,807
What are you doing here, Reynolds? Your DVD player broken?

266
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,394
Ames has no family. I felt like someone should be here for him.

267
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,980
Wow, that's nice.

268
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,151
Breathe.

269
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,797
Rupert Ames, do you have anything you want to say?

270
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,925
Yeah.

271
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,343
Uh-huh.

272
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,141
Ames: What I did that night was wrong.

273
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,061
I should have never been there.

274
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,858
But I swear to God, I didn't kill those people.

275
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,448
The wrong man's dying here today.

276
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,746
The wrong man's dying.

277
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,998
That's all.

278
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,483
Look at me.

279
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,819
Look at me!

280
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,716
Ahh! Fuck!

281
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,262
Fuck!

282
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,431
Ahh! Fuck!

283
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,225
Oh, God.

284
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,728
- Oh, God. - Take her- take her out.

285
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,106
- What the hell is going on? - I don't know.

286
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,403
Ahhh!

287
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,764
Man: What could have caused the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

288
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,933
We'll keep you informed.

289
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,352
You okay? Huh?

290
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,188
Yeah.

291
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,150
So somebody killed the guy you were trying to kill?

292
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,568
What are we calling this?

293
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,361
Clear violation of his Eighth Amendment rights-

294
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,322
- cruel and unusual punishment. - Law schooI.

295
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,699
Yeah. The machine- how does it work on a good day?

296
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,035
It's designed to be pain-free.

297
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,746
It's three drugs administered in a specific order.

298
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,081
From this point on, we're operating under the assumption

299
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,666
that the machine was corrupted.

300
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,753
We're gonna need a list of all the people with access to that machine.

301
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,505
- My people would not do this. - I appreciate that, Warden,

302
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,051
but I'm gonna need more than a hall pass and a note from Mom.

303
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,261
Detectives, got this off the back of the machine.

304
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,680
- Check it out. - Let me see it.

305
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,807
Man: Right there.

306
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,809
"Can't fight fate. "

307
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,645
Cantrell: What is it, Nick?

308
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,064
During the home invasion, Ames's accomplice

309
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,399
said to one of the vics, "You can't fight fate. "

310
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,861
And then he said the same thing to me in the courtroom- prick.

311
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,739
I can't remember his name, though.

312
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,450
Detective: Have a look at this- your guy?

313
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,827
- Nick: Clarence James Darby. - Detective: He's a cutie.

314
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,913
- You got history with him? - Nick: Put him away.

315
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,791
All right, three years. That the going rate for murder these days?

316
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,501
There was extenuating circumstances.

317
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,963
The only extenuating circumstances should be he didn't do it.

318
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,840
Still, three years at Marion? Fucking gladiator academy.

319
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,801
You expect him to come back a modeI citizen?

320
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,387
Well, if you scholars wouldn't contaminate the crime scenes,

321
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,930
I could keep them locked up longer.

322
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,140
TV reporter: Authorities have refused to comment at this point,

323
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,268
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

324
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,979
The prisoner had been on death row for the past 10 years-

325
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,605
his name, Rupert Ames.

326
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,148
Female reporter: All we know at this point

327
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,609
is what was supposed to be a painless execution

328
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,570
has turned into something out of a horror film.

329
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,870
Yeah?

330
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,123
- Disguised voice: Clarence Darby? - Who's this?

331
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,293
That's strike three for you: coke on the table,

332
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,045
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

333
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,674
Who the fuck is this?

334
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,552
Voice: Look out your window, south side.

335
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,681
- Is this a joke? Get up! - Ahh!

336
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,100
South side.

337
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,897
Motherfucker.

338
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,859
Shit. Out of the way!

339
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,081
- Stay down! - You're all crazy!

340
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,001
He's heading north! Go go!

341
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,962
- Damn. - Move it, move it. Go on!

342
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,848
- What now? - Wipe the prints off the gun.

343
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,142
- Get rid of it. - No no.

344
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,021
You fired six times, genius. You bring any ammunition?

345
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,898
- Lose it. - Why are you doing this?

346
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,733
I want to keep you out of prison.

347
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,652
See the abandoned factories? Go toward them.

348
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Why?

349
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,781
There's a cop car there with a cop in it.

350
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,115
What the fuck?

351
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,910
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up in about 90 seconds,

352
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,912
so you'd better move.

353
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,058
Rise and fucking shine, bitch. Wake the fuck up!

354
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,060
Let's go! Start the fucking car!

355
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,311
- Okay! - Do it.

356
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,772
- Take it easy, take it- - Come on!

357
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,607
- Okay, let's go. - Take it easy.

358
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,652
Let's go! Get in gear, shithead, now!

359
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,154
Do it! Go go go!

360
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,880
Get the fuck out.

361
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,304
Let's go.

362
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,432
Get the fuck down there!

363
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,602
Okay. What about my wife? My little girl?

364
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,981
- I'll never see them again. - Fucked up, ain't it?

365
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,025
Oh oh oh.

366
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,611
You don't mind if I take this, do you?

367
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,030
My guardian angel.

368
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,032
I am impressed.

369
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,245
You know why I'll never see my wife and little girl again?

370
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,210
'Cause you took 'em from me.

371
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,595
You remember me?

372
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,182
Sure you do.

373
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,059
You came over to my house once before.

374
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,270
You don't remember?

375
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,651
This tetrodotoxin...

376
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,155
should be nicely into your system by now.

377
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,075
It's isolated from the liver of a Caribbean puffer fish.

378
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,829
So it paralyzes you,

379
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,041
but leaves all the other neurological functions

380
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,084
perfectly intact.

381
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,588
In other words, you can't move...

382
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,300
but you feel everything.

383
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,805
It does absolutely nothing to blunt the pain.

384
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,767
And you're about to experience more of that

385
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,311
than you could ever fucking imagine.

386
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,739
These are tourniquets

387
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,993
so you don't bleed out, 'cause you may be here a while.

388
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,246
Saline solution-

389
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,957
that should keep us going.

390
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,211
Clamps- nice and secure.

391
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,257
Comfortable?

392
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,051
You really are shaking.

393
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,470
Sure you're all right?

394
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,891
You'll love this-

395
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,143
adrenaline.

396
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,398
Now this is so you don't pass out.

397
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,151
There you go.

398
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,488
How's that feel? Good?

399
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,118
Now what we don't want is you swallowing your tongue,

400
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,412
so bear with me.

401
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,297
Now this is for your penis, but we'll get to that later.

402
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,176
Scalpel...

403
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,304
for your eyelids,

404
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,307
in case you insist on fucking shutting them.

405
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,519
You see,

406
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,356
I know what it feels like to be helpless.

407
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,943
just like when I watched you slaughter my whole family.

408
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,283
You know you can't fight fate, right, Darby?

409
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,536
Oh!

410
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:07,124
And look- I made this especially for you.

411
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,422
You like it? Yeah, I didn't want you to miss anything.

412
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:19,094
Now you have the best view in the house.

413
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,138
You hear that?

414
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,516
Your heart is beating so fast.

415
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,646
No, me too.

416
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,272
Okay.

417
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,362
Now they get to watch you suffer.

418
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,742
They'll be the last thing you ever see

419
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,204
as I cut off every single one of your fucking limbs.

420
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,666
See, I wasn't lying

421
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,544
when I told you that I wanted to keep you out of prison.

422
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,591
That was the truth.

423
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,963
Thanks for the car.

424
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,199
Sarah: Okay, these are all the case files on Darby.

425
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,035
I vetted through what I could. We have crime-scene photos-

426
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,037
Don't need to see 'em.

427
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,749
Okay.

428
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,215
- What's bothering you? - It's Darby.

429
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,218
All the crimes he's committed have one thing in common,

430
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,554
and that was violence. But yesterday at that execution,

431
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,723
- that wasn't violence. That was- - What?

432
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,184
- That was intellect. - Okay.

433
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,520
- What are you thinking? - I don't know.

434
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,357
I'm just thinking maybe we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

435
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,078
Jesus Christ.

436
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,384
Rice.

437
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,471
Detective: Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

438
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,724
I gotta say though, he's looked better.

439
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,645
Sarah: They found him in about 25 pieces:

440
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,273
no legs, no arms, eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

441
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,275
- Nick: Shedding tears for Darby? - Not quite.

442
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,445
- Cantrell: I see your wheels turning. - Nick: Think motive- who has one?

443
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,281
Cantrell: The husband, the father. What do we know about him?

444
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,200
He owned the warehouse where they found Darby.

445
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,701
- What else? - He's a tinkerer-

446
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,622
uh, little inventions, gizmos. He holds two dozen patents

447
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,374
that made him some money.

448
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,377
He liquidated most of his wealth a few years ago

449
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,172
to buy some industrial properties around airports,

450
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,216
chemical plants, raiI yards.

451
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,885
- It doesn't add up. - No, it's weird, right?

452
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,512
Search 'em all, Sarah. See what you find.

453
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,674
Freeze!

454
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,928
- Get down, go! - On your knees!

455
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,723
- Face down, face down! - Pull him down and cuff him!

456
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,054
Crazy men scare the shit out of me.

457
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,348
Detective: Is this guy a lawyer?

458
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,975
No.

459
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,770
He's an engineer.

460
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,982
Sarah: Nick, look at this.

461
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,105
Cantrell: We have zero evidence. Gonna need a confession.

462
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,024
He give you any trouble on the way in?

463
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,400
No, nothing.

464
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,319
He wasn't too happy when we took his bracelet, though.

465
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,789
- Can I help you? - Package for the Rice family.

466
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,876
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

467
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,256
Mom, the video from my recital came. Can we watch it?

468
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,967
- Please? - No, not you.

469
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,720
No, please, we said we were gonna wait for your father, remember?

470
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,972
- Please? - No, not now.

471
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,224
Okay.

472
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,770
Uh-huh, yes.

473
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,774
Yes, absolutely.

474
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,878
Mommy!

475
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,106
Don't worry, he's just disarming the guy, letting him feeI easy.

476
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,485
What I'm about to tell you I don't want anybody else to hear.

477
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,404
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking all the rules right now,

478
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,282
and I don't give a damn because I'm a father.

479
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,368
I have a little girl.

480
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,288
And what you did... bravo.

481
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,461
The world is better without Darby and Ames.

482
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:36,133
You're not gonna see a tear shed from me or anybody in my office.

483
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,515
With that being said...

484
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,892
I have a job to do.

485
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,522
I'm gonna ask you some very simple and direct questions.

486
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,568
I suggest that you answer them in the same fashion.

487
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,736
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

488
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,822
Yes, sir.

489
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,740
And you've waived your right to counsel, correct?

490
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,703
- Yes, sir. - You sure you want to do that?

491
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,079
Yes.

492
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,666
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

493
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,628
I wanted him dead.

494
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,463
He killed my wife and child.

495
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,842
Rupert Ames- did you murder him as well?

496
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,387
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

497
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,515
They both deserved to die.

498
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,269
So you arranged both of those murders?

499
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,771
Yes, I planned it...

500
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:35,775
in my head, over and over again. It took me a long time.

501
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,780
All right.

502
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,116
I guess we're done here.

503
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,869
Counselor?

504
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,291
You might want to canceI your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

505
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,919
Excuse me?

506
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,421
In fact, you might want to cancel the rest of the week,

507
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,299
'cause you're gonna be busy. Sit down.

508
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,678
We're done here. We have your confession.

509
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,181
Mmm. Oh, you do?

510
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,933
On tape.

511
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,936
See, in our profession, we consider that a slam-dunk.

512
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,855
Oh, really? I don't think so. Let's think back.

513
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,690
What did I say?

514
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,860
That I wanted to kill Clarence Darby?

515
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,363
Yeah, sure. What father wouldn't?

516
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,157
That both Darby and Ames deserved to die?

517
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,951
I think most people would agree with that.

518
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:29,471
That I planned it over and over again in my head?

519
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,891
Yeah. Who wouldn't fantasize about that?

520
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,769
None of these are an admission of guilt, Nick.

521
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,646
- You might want to check the tape. - We know you did it.

522
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:42,150
Well, it's not what you know, it's what you can prove in court.

523
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:43,777
Didn't you tell me that once?

524
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:45,278
The only problem with your theory

525
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,572
is that Darby's body was found on your property.

526
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,909
One of my many properties- an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

527
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:53,995
Junkies, they trespass there all the time.

528
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,247
Isn't Darby involved in the drug trade?

529
00:37:56,415 --> 00:37:59,125
That's an unsavory world. I bet you a jury would agree.

530
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:02,337
Or perhaps someone was trying to frame me.

531
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,214
You know, Clyde,

532
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,467
there's a lot of assholes in prison that thought they were smarter than me.

533
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,178
Let's stop fucking around.

534
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:13,306
Nick, unless you have any hard evidence,

535
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:15,850
then why are we even here? Why are we having this-

536
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,436
- What do you want? - -conversation?

537
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,732
Well, that's easy.

538
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,194
Now you're the one who makes deals with murderers, yeah?

539
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:28,571
So I've come to make mine.

540
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:33,243
I will give you a confession, a reaI confession.

541
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,578
You just have to give me something in return.

542
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,915
Yeah, well, since you are a murderer, what might that be?

543
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,251
A bed.

544
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:46,214
But a nice bed.

545
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:48,800
I want a nice new one for my cell.

546
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:50,468
Very simple.

547
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:53,179
You're gonna have to deal with that, because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

548
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:55,390
It's making me crazy.

549
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:58,143
Clyde, I think you've got me confused with detail people.

550
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,395
See, I don't deaI with prison conditions.

551
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,814
I believe those cots are bolted into the cells.

552
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:06,067
Well, that's what wrenches are for, dumbass.

553
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,487
You know, one of those new Duxiana beds

554
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,991
with the adjustable- you know, adjustable lumbar support,

555
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,492
- that's the one. - I've seen the commercial.

556
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,077
- That's the one I want. - Those are nice.

557
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:18,079
- 'Cause really- - Comes on late at night.

558
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,914
- And frankly I don't think- - Two old people laying on the bed.

559
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,499
- I'll be able to focus on anything

560
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,835
untiI I've had a good revitalizing night's sleep

561
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:26,254
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

562
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:28,131
So that's the deal:

563
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,843
you get me my bed, you get your confession.

564
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:34,846
Okay, let me think about that for a second.

565
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:37,140
How about...

566
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,100
fuck no.

567
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,112
Hey, what are you doing?

568
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,406
- What do you mean? - Why did you tell him no?

569
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:56,701
A mattress? He doesn't make those kinds of decisions.

570
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,038
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's got a point: this case is shit.

571
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,540
We need a confession. And a mattress for a murder confession?

572
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,918
- That's a pretty good deal. - He's playing us, Jonas.

573
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:06,586
Well, then we will play him.

574
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,338
Nick?

575
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,049
There's an urgent call from your office. They say you're not answering your cell.

576
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:14,052
I need to finish up here and then I will be home as soon as I can.

577
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,137
Listen to me: the things on this video-

578
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,932
Nick, I have never seen anything like it.

579
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:20,433
Please come home.

580
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:24,437
Listen, you need to calm down. Tell her that it's not real...

581
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:26,272
- Okay. - ... and that I love her.

582
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,482
Come home. Come home soon, please.

583
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,484
- Kelly, did you see his face? - No.

584
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:31,736
It was covered with something. I couldn't see.

585
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,906
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

586
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,950
Okay.

587
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:40,203
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house of him killing Darby.

588
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,164
- What? - My daughter saw it.

589
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,501
He recorded it? We've got him.

590
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:50,129
No no, he had on a mask. We need that confession.

591
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,423
You still want to bargain with this man?

592
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:54,801
The art of the possible, Warden.

593
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,469
Make the deal.

594
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,100
Man: Hey, come on, man! Give us one!

595
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:18,032
Back problems, Warden- the worst.

596
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,618
You got bigger problems than that.

597
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:23,371
It's the have-nots in here, son.

598
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:27,208
I don't know that I want to be the one "have. "

599
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,463
Turn around.

600
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,136
I don't think he likes me.

601
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,515
Nice bed.

602
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,352
Thank you.

603
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,022
It's a single.

604
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:53,735
I'd watch my fucking back around here, you hear?

605
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:56,529
In the cell, let's go.

606
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:02,243
We can't put Clyde Shelton anywhere-

607
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,495
not in a job, not in a city, not even the country.

608
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:07,707
So I dug a little deeper and I found something from his missing years:

609
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:11,377
a couple of contract payments to Clyde from the Department of Defense.

610
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:14,213
- And his real estate? - He bought nine properties

611
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,299
under his own name, then he transferred them

612
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,634
to some corporation in Panama.

613
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,795
We can't get to the addresses.

614
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:21,262
A lack of reciprocity is our problem.

615
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,014
So I'm gonna circle back to the farmhouse.

616
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:26,392
That's a waste of time. He wanted us to find it and find him there.

617
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,770
It's the industrial stuff that's curious.

618
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,439
All right, I don't care what you have to do and who you have to piss off.

619
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:34,108
If we have to invade Panama again, fine.

620
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:36,778
Clyde is hiding those properties for a reason. Find him.

621
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,196
Got it.

622
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:53,002
- Baby, you leave it cracked? - Hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

623
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,880
- Night light? - Isn't she too old for a night light?

624
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:58,299
Yeah, I left a night light.

625
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,343
- Good. - Look,

626
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,345
I told her that that video wasn't real.

627
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,764
- Okay. - It's some sort of horror film-

628
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:06,432
something she shouldn't be looking at anyway.

629
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,309
- Okay, good. - She'll be okay.

630
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:09,977
Yeah. And you?

631
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:13,064
- Am I what? Okay? - Yeah.

632
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:15,274
Of course. Don't I look okay?

633
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:17,318
- Hmm? - Yeah.

634
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:21,864
Nick is always okay.

635
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,659
Always- I'm extra good.

636
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:28,287
I love you.

637
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:29,872
I love you too.

638
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,214
In light of Mr. Shelton's economic means

639
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,091
and his potential flight risk,

640
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:43,678
the egregious nature of both Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

641
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:47,682
the state requests that bail be denied, Your Honor.

642
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,018
Judge: Seeing as how you've...

643
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:54,188
waived your right to counsel, Mr. Shelton,

644
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,607
do you have anything to say?

645
00:43:56,775 --> 00:43:58,776
Mr. Shelton?

646
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,281
Do you have anything that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

647
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,783
Yes yes yes, Your Honor.

648
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:08,828
- Should I stand? - Please.

649
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,964
Your Honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

650
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:22,008
I'm just a regular guy.

651
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:24,969
I am not a flight risk.

652
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:27,722
And this is my first alleged offense.

653
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,518
And the prosecution has not presented one single piece of evidence against me.

654
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,063
Now in these circumstances,

655
00:44:36,231 --> 00:44:38,733
unless the state has obtained some new piece of information

656
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,652
relating to my involvement in the matter in question,

657
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,740
then I find it highly prejudiciaI, even constitutionally offensive,

658
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:48,201
to keep me detained without bail.

659
00:44:48,368 --> 00:44:50,453
It's a slippery slope, Your Honor.

660
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,748
Haven't we seen the result of such violations,

661
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:56,334
both internationally and domestically? Case in point

662
00:44:56,502 --> 00:45:00,797
would be Day v. McDonough, docket #041325.

663
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:07,553
I am actually inclined to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

664
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,891
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has agreed to give us a full confession.

665
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,019
Has he given it, Mr. Rice?

666
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:16,646
No, Your Honor.

667
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,482
Well, then in my opinion,

668
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,401
the state has failed to establish a compelling basis

669
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,738
for its motion, and I will grant bail in the amount of-

670
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:28,074
Your Honor, I would caution you not to do that.

671
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,910
Thank you.

672
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:32,620
Excuse me?

673
00:45:32,788 --> 00:45:35,414
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

674
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:37,458
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

675
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:40,545
You were about to let me go. Are you kidding me?

676
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:44,131
This is why we're here in the first place.

677
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:48,052
You think I don't remember who you are, lady?

678
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,055
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

679
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:52,932
Well, how carefully should I tread?

680
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,810
Because apparently I just killed two people,

681
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:59,438
and you were about to let me walk right out that door!

682
00:45:59,606 --> 00:46:01,983
How misguided are you?

683
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,486
I feed you a couple of bullshit legal precedents,

684
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:08,739
and there you go- you jump on it like a bitch in heat.

685
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:11,367
- Folks, you all hang out- - I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

686
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,452
- -in the same little club. - You will be held in contempt!

687
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,830
And every day you let madmen and murderers back on the street.

688
00:46:15,998 --> 00:46:18,416
- You're too busy treating the law- - One more time!

689
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:19,959
- -like it's a fucking assembly line! - One more time.

690
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,836
- Do you have any idea what justice is? - You are now-

691
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,921
- Whatever happened to right and wrong? - -in contempt of court.

692
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:27,174
- Whatever happened to right and wrong? - Remove this man.

693
00:46:27,342 --> 00:46:29,802
- Whatever happened to the people? - Bail denied!

694
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,929
- Whatever happened to justice? - Bail denied!

695
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:35,308
And I bet you take it up the fucking ass, bitch.

696
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:36,642
Bailiff.

697
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,603
Clyde: Hey, see you later, Nick.

698
00:46:39,855 --> 00:46:42,064
Nick: Insanity?

699
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,985
That's what you're building your defense on? Insanity?

700
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:50,823
Nick, I told you I would give you a confession.

701
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:52,700
And I- I meant it.

702
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:54,952
- I saw a movie today. - You did?

703
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,955
My daughter saw the same movie.

704
00:46:58,123 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, you taught your daughter about good versus eviI?

705
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:02,835
I don't have to.

706
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:06,464
Well, that's what this movie was about: good conquering evil,

707
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:08,966
the righteous prospering, the wicked suffering.

708
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:11,052
I didn't get that.

709
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,221
I'm gonna give you one more chance, Clyde.

710
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:17,892
And don't test me 'cause I will run you over.

711
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,977
Fair enough.

712
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:22,688
You did get me my bed.

713
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:25,149
A deal's a deal.

714
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:28,027
That was you on video killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

715
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:29,946
Yes, that was me.

716
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:35,743
Okay, fair enough. That was me, Clyde Shelton,

717
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:37,787
on the video, killing Clarence Darby.

718
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,039
Not good enough, Clyde. I need specifics.

719
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:46,045
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

720
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:47,421
his toes with tin snips,

721
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,924
his balls with a hacksaw,

722
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:53,386
and his penis with a box cutter.

723
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,262
How's that for specifics?

724
00:47:56,348 --> 00:47:57,723
And Ames?

725
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:01,519
Switching the canisters was easy. Everything's automated these days,

726
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:03,938
so I just hacked into the shipping company's server

727
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:07,024
and swapped a few numbers around so the package came to me.

728
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:09,402
Then I switched the potassium chloride

729
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:13,864
with something a little more... deliberate.

730
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,243
Well, I'm tired of hearing your bullshit.

731
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,328
I got everything I need.

732
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,664
What now?

733
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,582
I go home; you go to prison.

734
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,168
You know, the righteous prospering, the wicked suffering.

735
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,587
That ought to make you feel better about the system.

736
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:30,047
What if I had another confession to make?

737
00:48:30,215 --> 00:48:31,924
Call a priest.

738
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:33,968
But another confession would mean another deal, Nick,

739
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:37,179
so you would have to give me something in return.

740
00:48:40,392 --> 00:48:44,395
You ever been to Del Frisco's? They cater.

741
00:48:44,563 --> 00:48:48,399
So for lunch, I would love a 20oz porterhouse steak,

742
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,027
medium, maybe a little bit charred,

743
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,489
with all the trimmings- pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

744
00:48:55,657 --> 00:48:58,200
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

745
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,371
I'll tell you what: can I have my iPod as well?

746
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,374
I'd love a little bit of music with my meal.

747
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,419
First rule of negotiating, Clyde: you gotta have something to bargain with.

748
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:12,089
Would the life of Bill Reynolds suffice?

749
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:20,598
Open it.

750
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:25,102
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

751
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,937
Darby's attorney.

752
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:29,523
Tell me you located him.

753
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:33,277
I've got his wife. She reported him missing three days ago.

754
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:35,321
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

755
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:38,532
Clyde: Well, looks like I got something to bargain with after all, Nick.

756
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,703
At the moment, Bill Reynolds is still alive.

757
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:45,748
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

758
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,752
Just bring me my meal and my music at 1:00 exactly.

759
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,338
00 sharp.

760
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:54,632
00, Nick.

761
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,523
That's good, right there.

762
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,237
All right, up!

763
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:26,122
- It's 5 to 1:00. - I don't take orders from him or you.

764
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,165
And inmates don't have access to the time.

765
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:31,252
- We tell them what time it is. - I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

766
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:33,462
We need to stick to the timeline that was agreed to.

767
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,756
Fuck him, Nick. Let him wait.

768
00:50:35,924 --> 00:50:37,633
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

769
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,969
Whether you like it or not, we are on his time.

770
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,012
Check it again.

771
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:48,394
Inmate: Are you shitting me with this?!

772
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:52,690
This motherfucker!

773
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,905
Man, come on! I'm fucking hungry!

774
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:07,913
Steamed asparagus,

775
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,916
- lobster macaroni and cheese... - Wow.

776
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,629
...porterhouse steak, seared, medium rare.

777
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:18,757
Mmm!

778
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:24,889
Hmm.

779
00:51:25,056 --> 00:51:27,141
- Napkin, Nick. - Napkin.

780
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:32,438
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

781
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:35,649
You might want to put 30% down for yourself, my man.

782
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:41,614
- Hey, what time is it? - It's 1:00.

783
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:44,450
Is that right, Nick?

784
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:48,329
- It's 1:08. - That's disappointing, Warden.

785
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,706
I mean, how can you expect me not to fuck with you

786
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,416
when you can't even be honest with me?

787
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:56,462
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

788
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,547
Can I have some silverware, gentlemen?

789
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,132
Silverware.

790
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,593
You get a spork.

791
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:05,638
Idiot.

792
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:09,642
Thanks.

793
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,527
Come on, Clyde.

794
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,700
Okay.

795
00:52:26,868 --> 00:52:29,620
Here we go:

796
00:52:29,788 --> 00:52:34,667
39N57'...04",

797
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:38,504
075W10'22".

798
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,297
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

799
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:43,008
'Cause by anybody's watch but the warden's, you're already late.

800
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:45,886
- Open the door! - Inmate: Where's my lunch?

801
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,853
I'll take a ground unit!

802
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,628
So I suppose if I don't share this with you, you're gonna-

803
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,255
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

804
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:23,424
I'm gonna cock back my right hand,

805
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:27,177
and I'm gonna split your whole fucking skull in two. How about that?

806
00:53:28,722 --> 00:53:32,016
Well, come on over here. Join me. There's plenty to go around.

807
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,982
Here, enjoy. Have some pasta.

808
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,276
It's good.

809
00:53:42,444 --> 00:53:44,069
What about some steak? You want steak?

810
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:45,738
- Mmm. - Here, have some steak.

811
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:48,032
Here's a big piece for you.

812
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,326
There you go.

813
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,497
Good, huh?

814
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:07,593
What'd you do to get in here, anyways?

815
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:12,097
I did what I had to do.

816
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:19,521
So you got a girl or something?

817
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,902
Mmm, it's a long story.

818
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:30,783
Pilot, how much longer?

819
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,036
Two minutes.

820
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,291
How about you? You have a girl?

821
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:41,960
- Got a few girls back home. - Oh, yeah?

822
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:43,796
Yeah.

823
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:46,965
- You have a boyfriend in here or no? - Get the fuck out of here.

824
00:55:01,189 --> 00:55:03,023
This is- it's Reynolds's.

825
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,527
- Not a good sign, Nick. - Just dig.

826
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,376
- Jesus Christ! - Reynolds!

827
00:55:22,544 --> 00:55:25,587
- He's unconscious. - Reynolds!

828
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,757
He's gone, Nick. He's gone.

829
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,968
- Oxygen? - Get something to get him out!

830
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:34,756
Detective: He's got IV lines going to his-

831
00:55:34,806 --> 00:55:37,050
He's got him cuffed!

832
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,222
Nick: Listen, you got your keys to the cuffs?

833
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,641
- Mmm! - Mmm.

834
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,400
Shit.

835
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:49,236
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

836
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:51,905
Your lucky day, huh? Get some food.

837
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:54,950
Here, wanna take a shot at this?

838
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,244
- What is it? - Know how to use it?

839
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:59,663
No.

840
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:19,308
Inmate: Oh, shit! Check this out!

841
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:24,646
He's crazy!

842
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,315
Don't stop now, partner!

843
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,318
Finish him, come on! Take his head off!

844
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:33,739
Take it off!

845
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:05,938
I need a shower, Warden.

846
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:07,314
Get him out of there!

847
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,320
Nick: Dunnigan, what time do you have?

848
00:57:15,573 --> 00:57:16,865
37.

849
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,825
Took us roughly 15 minutes to get here.

850
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:20,077
Yeah?

851
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:22,746
Reynolds's air was rigged to shut off at 1:15.

852
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:25,666
If Shelton would have got his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

853
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,125
Fuck this guy, Nick.

854
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:31,046
He wants to play games, we can play games too.

855
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,549
We need to take the gloves off.

856
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,425
No.

857
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,599
Nick, it's Sarah. Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

858
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:46,645
The warden is furious. He's moving him to solitary.

859
00:57:46,813 --> 00:57:49,064
That's all I know right now.

860
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,764
How are we doing?

861
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,851
Great. Can you believe this?

862
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:29,146
Checking his iPod for clues.

863
00:58:29,314 --> 00:58:30,856
I do the same thing with my daughter's.

864
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:32,733
Learn anything?

865
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,319
Yeah, they both got shit taste in music.

866
00:58:37,363 --> 00:58:39,740
We got a game plan with this guy or what?

867
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,491
Game plan?

868
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:43,535
I tell you, I got a game plan.

869
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:46,413
Give me five minutes alone with him and I'll cripple the fucker.

870
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:49,583
I don't give a shit what happened to his family.

871
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:51,209
It's no excuse.

872
00:58:58,301 --> 00:58:59,885
Wow.

873
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:08,685
Stop right there.

874
00:59:17,362 --> 00:59:19,071
Step into the cell.

875
01:00:05,284 --> 01:00:07,746
We found Reynolds.

876
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:10,833
Moments too late, from what I hear.

877
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:14,961
I had to call his wife and tell her that her husband had been buried alive.

878
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:17,793
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

879
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:20,486
but especially for those who denied it to others.

880
01:00:20,528 --> 01:00:23,183
And your cell-mate? What was that about?

881
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:29,903
You murdered a man because your lunch was late.

882
01:00:29,946 --> 01:00:31,909
No.

883
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:36,233
No. No, you murdered him because you couldn't keep your word.

884
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:39,629
We made a deal, you and I: 00 PM.

885
01:00:39,665 --> 01:00:42,854
That's a pretty important principle I'd like you start learning, Nick:

886
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:44,948
- keeping your word. - Oh, really?

887
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,975
What principle was at work when you tortured and killed those people?

888
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:51,706
That everyone must be held accountable for their actions.

889
01:00:57,804 --> 01:01:00,707
You think your wife and daughter would feel good

890
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,592
about you killing in their name?

891
01:01:29,322 --> 01:01:32,943
My wife and daughter can't feeI anything.

892
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:36,234
They're dead.

893
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:14,297
Hey, Nick?

894
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,665
On Clyde's real estate, Judge Stansfield shut us down.

895
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,293
He's looking for some sort of legal precedent that I'm not sure exists.

896
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:21,503
- But? - But...

897
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,963
I think I may have found a way around it.

898
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,298
- I'll call in a favor from a friend. - Who's your friend?

899
01:02:25,466 --> 01:02:27,634
You don't name your friends or they stop doing you favors.

900
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:29,469
Something else Cantrell said.

901
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:33,640
No, that was all you. Jonas, hi.

902
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,769
She's thinking just like you, Nick. Guess you trained her well.

903
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:40,939
- One day she'll have my job. - Let's get some air.

904
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:46,319
Clyde's government contract payments were bothering me,

905
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:49,072
so I pulled some ancient strings. We're meeting someone.

906
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,699
Who might that be?

907
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:54,703
Someone who does some really nasty shit so we can live the American dream.

908
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,842
So Clyde finally lost it?

909
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:11,136
Somebody must have really pissed him off.

910
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:13,638
You worked with Shelton, is that right?

911
01:03:13,806 --> 01:03:17,517
Okay, first of all, I was never here and we never spoke.

912
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:20,312
Tell us what we're dealing with. Shelton was a spy or-

913
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,064
Spies are a dime a dozen. I'm a spy.

914
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,735
Clyde is a brain. He's a think-tank type guy.

915
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,404
His specialty was low-impact kinetic operations.

916
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,948
Is this a hell of a fancy way to say that he kills people?

917
01:03:32,116 --> 01:03:33,241
We kill people.

918
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,911
He figured out how to do it without ever being in the same room.

919
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:39,414
It was his gift, and he was the best.

920
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,000
One time we're tasking this tricky target.

921
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:44,669
I mean, we're using cruise missiles and predators

922
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:48,632
and we even had a B-2 bomber flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

923
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,425
All right? We're burning up millions in ordnance

924
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:51,927
and we're getting nowhere with this guy.

925
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:55,013
So we call Clyde and we ask him to solve our problem.

926
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:57,098
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

927
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,935
with a high-tech ratchet made of carbon fiber

928
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,978
put in a necktie.

929
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:04,731
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy comes home,

930
01:04:04,899 --> 01:04:07,609
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead on the bathroom tile,

931
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,110
choked to death.

932
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:13,782
What I'm saying is, just assume that this guy can hear and see

933
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,617
everything that you're doing.

934
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,911
Nick: No, we've got him locked away, maximum security.

935
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,081
Man: If he's in jail, it's because he wants to be in jail.

936
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:24,918
He's a born tactician. Every move that he makes, it means something.

937
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,421
That cell-mate that he killed- you think that was random?

938
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:31,758
No.

939
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:34,552
That's a pawn being moved off the board.

940
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,974
If I were you, I'd be looking for the next piece.

941
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,810
Anybody who had anything to do with that case,

942
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,979
he's gonna be coming after you.

943
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:49,192
So what are you saying? You saying we can't stop him?

944
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:54,114
Walk into his cell and put a bullet in his head.

945
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:58,952
Aside from that? No, you can't stop him.

946
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,638
If Clyde wants you dead, you're dead.

947
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:16,052
- Hello? - Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

948
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,971
Set up a meeting with Judge Burch.

949
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:20,140
We need her to help us keep Clyde on ice.

950
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,934
Help us with what, Nick? The man's in prison.

951
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:24,811
He's worse than we thought.

952
01:05:24,979 --> 01:05:27,439
- Chester's your boyfriend, right? - Chester.

953
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:29,441
Yeah.

954
01:05:29,608 --> 01:05:32,819
Good. Maybe stay a few days at his place.

955
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:36,031
And have Dunnigan send a patroI car to my house.

956
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,949
Sorry about this, Sarah.

957
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,417
Judge Burch: I can't supersede the penal code.

958
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:49,044
You've already got him in solitary.

959
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,463
A half-decent paralegal will have him out of there by next week.

960
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,298
We just want to limit his options;

961
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:55,133
give him less contact, less access,

962
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:58,651
even if it's just rescinding his mandatory exercise period for a week.

963
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,089
- Under what cause? - Whatever cause you want.

964
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,390
Wrap it around whatever piece of legal doctrine

965
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:07,093
that helps you rationalize it, Your Honor.

966
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:10,204
So let me get this straight:

967
01:06:10,238 --> 01:06:13,072
you want me to violate his God-given civil rights

968
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:15,874
in the name of some murky sense of the greater good.

969
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:18,007
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen?

970
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:27,387
Okay. I'm game.

971
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:32,529
Just don't plan on it sticking for long, all right?

972
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,805
Wait, you're gonna take that,

973
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:40,007
after all the grief you've given me over cell phones?

974
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:43,280
That's one of the benefits of being a judge, Mr. Rice.

975
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:46,346
I can pretty much do whatever I want.

976
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:50,194
Hello?

977
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:54,530
Oh my God.

978
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:57,231
Nick: Back out. Back out.

979
01:07:00,032 --> 01:07:03,993
Female reporter:... at city hall, though we are unable to confirm the details,

980
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:06,287
we do know that at least one person is dead

981
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,581
in what officials are calling a possible murder.

982
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,000
We have reporters on the ground...

983
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:12,418
Up.

984
01:07:17,508 --> 01:07:19,342
Somebody's helping this guy-

985
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,761
a bomb in that phone, and she doesn't know about it.

986
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:24,889
Who had access?

987
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:26,766
Are you okay?

988
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:29,602
I've survived the war and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

989
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,439
How are you holding up?

990
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:35,900
I'm good.

991
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,794
So you're killing judges now?

992
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:58,034
In my experience, Nick, lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten.

993
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,872
And vengeance keeps you warm at night.

994
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,707
Vengeance?

995
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,573
That's what you think this is about? Vengeance?

996
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,448
What else could it be?

997
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:13,786
No, Nick, I had 10 years for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

998
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:17,624
You don't think that I watch you go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

999
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:21,688
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise to schooI, 8:15?

1000
01:08:21,732 --> 01:08:25,634
No, I could have slaughtered you or your family anytime I wanted!

1001
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,537
You even think about touching my family-

1002
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:32,202
you even think about touching my family...

1003
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:43,011
I do my job.

1004
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:45,455
I'm the best at it.

1005
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:47,982
- It works. - You were doing yourjob

1006
01:08:48,027 --> 01:08:52,361
the way that best served you, Nick- the way that best served you.

1007
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:55,698
- That has to change. - What do you want, Clyde?

1008
01:08:55,736 --> 01:08:58,466
You at war with the whole world? It's not gonna bring anybody back.

1009
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:01,732
No, I'm at war with this-

1010
01:09:01,775 --> 01:09:04,703
this- this broken thing-

1011
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:07,372
this thing that brought you and I together.

1012
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:10,043
This broken thing works for people that are sane.

1013
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:12,484
You think doing what you're doing is gonna change anything?

1014
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,216
You and whoever else you have helping you

1015
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:17,247
are gonna pay.

1016
01:09:18,993 --> 01:09:23,795
I don't think you have any idea who's helping me or what I'm doing.

1017
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:25,163
It's a matter of time.

1018
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,532
See, you see the bodies, you see the smoke,

1019
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:30,697
but the larger picture still eludes you.

1020
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:32,866
Do tell.

1021
01:09:34,043 --> 01:09:37,275
I would like to...

1022
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:39,179
but I would rather show you.

1023
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:45,347
I still have faith in you, so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

1024
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:46,753
Here's the deal:

1025
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:51,421
release me and drop all charges by 6:00 AM.

1026
01:09:51,462 --> 01:09:54,260
- 6:00 AM, Nick. - Or what?

1027
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:59,701
Or I kill everyone.

1028
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,941
- Hello? - Nick: Yeah, Sarah,

1029
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:16,114
he has to have an accomplice- probably somebody inside the prison.

1030
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:19,570
We have to go through all the prisoners' files to find some sort of connection.

1031
01:10:19,608 --> 01:10:21,499
Do you want the files brought to the office?

1032
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:24,881
No, there isn't time. Get everybody together and bring them to the prison.

1033
01:10:24,918 --> 01:10:26,464
We're moving in.

1034
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,034
Stop looking at your watch.

1035
01:10:49,276 --> 01:10:51,098
Anything from your friend?

1036
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:52,960
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1037
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,592
We can't access anything about specific property holdings,

1038
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,636
but my friend found this tiny loophole

1039
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:01,015
that grants us access to Clyde's corporate expenses.

1040
01:11:01,065 --> 01:11:03,178
Does that help?

1041
01:11:06,904 --> 01:11:10,941
So we match sale prices of industrial properties sold in Philly

1042
01:11:10,991 --> 01:11:13,819
up against purchases made by his corporation.

1043
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:18,088
Okay, I got it.

1044
01:11:25,923 --> 01:11:29,862
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something? - Hmm?

1045
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,214
Would you do it the same way now?

1046
01:11:34,264 --> 01:11:37,820
Would you still cut a deal for Darby?

1047
01:11:38,602 --> 01:11:42,598
This is the job, Sarah. We have to make choices.

1048
01:11:42,648 --> 01:11:47,732
- But did you make the right choice? - We made the right choice, right?

1049
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:51,440
I don't know.

1050
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,026
I'm 35, Nick.

1051
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,153
And there are things- there are possibilities

1052
01:11:56,203 --> 01:11:57,954
that I'm not gonna have now.

1053
01:11:59,123 --> 01:12:03,042
And it's okay. I know it's part of the deal.

1054
01:12:04,878 --> 01:12:08,047
And don't get me wrong. I love working for you.

1055
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,054
But I just want to make sure I gave up those things

1056
01:12:15,222 --> 01:12:18,641
for more than just a high conviction rate.

1057
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:40,329
Do you want any more coffee?

1058
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:41,747
No.

1059
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,931
All right.

1060
01:13:40,098 --> 01:13:42,433
All right, let's just get focused here. This guy's not God.

1061
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:45,019
He's not the All Powerful. He's just well-prepared.

1062
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,188
We need to be equally well-prepared.

1063
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,067
Take a couple of hours, go home, come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1064
01:13:51,235 --> 01:13:52,610
Okay?

1065
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:06,457
Man: Come on, old man, let's see if we can find you some breakfast.

1066
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:23,558
Hey, Nick, get some rest.

1067
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:28,062
Give Chester my regards. When do I get to meet him?

1068
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,482
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1069
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,277
'Night, Jonas.

1070
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:47,873
I don't know how this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1071
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,042
We're gonna stop him. That's how it's gonna turn out.

1072
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:53,011
Ahh!

1073
01:15:00,938 --> 01:15:02,149


1074
01:15:02,306 --> 01:15:05,016
Sarah.

1075
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:12,106
Sarah.

1076
01:15:45,515 --> 01:15:49,046
Reporter: In the past 48 hours, six officials from the Justice Department

1077
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:52,521
have been killed in a series of vicious and premeditated attacks.

1078
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:55,358
This marks the first time in the history of the United States

1079
01:15:55,525 --> 01:16:00,529
where government officials have been, by all appearances,systematically murdered.

1080
01:16:00,697 --> 01:16:03,532
We'll continue to follow this story and bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1081
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:10,539
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now, but we've got something here.

1082
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,570
Found this right outside the wall-

1083
01:16:13,606 --> 01:16:15,542
radio beacon-

1084
01:16:15,577 --> 01:16:18,242
sent an arming signal to the car bombs when they went through the gate.

1085
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,049
Dunnigan: Security said they checked every car before anybody got in them.

1086
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:24,619
They didn't check the gas tanks. That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1087
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:26,325
Real precise stuff too.

1088
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:28,598
Could have taken out a lot more if he wanted to.

1089
01:16:28,637 --> 01:16:31,370
- Cantrell: What about Nick's car? - That's the weird thing.

1090
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:34,074
It's clean- hadn't been touched.

1091
01:16:35,284 --> 01:16:37,277
I gotta go.

1092
01:16:45,138 --> 01:16:47,074
Woman: Jesus Christ.

1093
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:57,727
Privacy, please.

1094
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:02,498
So let me get this straight:

1095
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,569
not only do we know who did it,

1096
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:09,884
we have him locked up and he's still killing people?

1097
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:15,428
You boys sure fucked this one up.

1098
01:17:15,467 --> 01:17:19,635
The press is gonna kill us.

1099
01:17:19,675 --> 01:17:21,669
Can someone explain this to me?

1100
01:17:21,714 --> 01:17:23,273
We can't yet.

1101
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:32,065
How did this get away from you, Jonas?

1102
01:17:32,102 --> 01:17:34,368
It's complicated, April.

1103
01:17:34,406 --> 01:17:37,037
He's very smart. He's very angry.

1104
01:17:37,078 --> 01:17:39,675
We assume he has an accomplice helping him on the outside.

1105
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:43,521
I'm not having this conversation.

1106
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:47,191
I don't care how smart he is or who's helping him.

1107
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:56,510
We'll release a statement saying we have suspects, we're following leads-

1108
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:59,649
- nothing alarming. - Mayor, you have my word,

1109
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:03,654
we are gonna stop this guy. He's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1110
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:11,176
I'm assigning security to each of you from now on.

1111
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,020
Get this situation under control, gentlemen.

1112
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,352
Dad?

1113
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,854
I bet you don't remember when I did that.

1114
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:41,440
I bet you I do.

1115
01:18:56,456 --> 01:18:58,249
What?

1116
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:00,125
Nothing.

1117
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:03,587
You and your mother are going away on a little vacation, that's all.

1118
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:05,339
- You like vacations, right? - Yeah.

1119
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,383
Good.

1120
01:19:07,551 --> 01:19:09,260
But why?

1121
01:19:09,427 --> 01:19:11,595
Why not now?

1122
01:19:11,763 --> 01:19:13,931
Okay.

1123
01:19:14,099 --> 01:19:16,934
Don't need an excuse, right?

1124
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,772
All right.

1125
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,901
No phone calls, no credit cards, no computers- just cash.

1126
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:27,653
Daddy, are you coming?

1127
01:19:27,821 --> 01:19:30,698
Oh, yeah, of course.

1128
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:33,200
- Of course I am. - You'd better, Nick.

1129
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:40,666
It was first grade, hmm?

1130
01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:43,002
Your mother helped you with the spelling.

1131
01:19:43,169 --> 01:19:45,337
It was my birthday.

1132
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:48,299
- Man: We need to go! - Let's go.

1133
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:50,134
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.

1134
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:52,636
- Love you, Daddy. - Love you too.

1135
01:19:57,517 --> 01:20:00,060
- Nick, your phone lines are clear. - Good.

1136
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,272
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with. You're good.

1137
01:21:51,548 --> 01:21:53,716
You should have taken my deal.

1138
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:02,801
That's six fucking innocent people. Is that how you want to play it? Huh?

1139
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:05,887
It's okay. It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1140
01:22:05,937 --> 01:22:08,807
That's good. That's what it takes. That's how it has to be.

1141
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:10,524
What if I said you was right and I was wrong?

1142
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,485
What if I had said, "Well, let's take them to trial"? Huh?

1143
01:22:13,653 --> 01:22:15,279
Then I would say you're making progress.

1144
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,657
And we might have lost! And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1145
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:21,285
Don't you get that?

1146
01:22:21,453 --> 01:22:22,703
Fuck.

1147
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,080
You didn't care, Nick. You didn't even try.

1148
01:22:25,248 --> 01:22:27,958
You could have walked out of that courtroom with your head held high.

1149
01:22:28,126 --> 01:22:29,877
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1150
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,837
I keep my head up.

1151
01:22:32,005 --> 01:22:35,799
And you will end this.

1152
01:22:37,594 --> 01:22:39,720
I'm just getting warmed up.

1153
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:42,639
This is Von Clausewitz shit- total fucking war.

1154
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:44,725
You fuck.

1155
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:51,440
No.

1156
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:03,702
I'm gonna pull the whole thing down.

1157
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:06,830
I'm gonna bring the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1158
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:09,458
down on your head.

1159
01:23:09,626 --> 01:23:12,211
It's gonna be Biblical.

1160
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,731
Cantrell: Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1161
01:23:33,733 --> 01:23:36,110
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1162
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:40,823
Absolutely not.

1163
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:45,536
You don't actually believe that, do you?

1164
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,835
Gentlemen? Sorry, but we need to get going

1165
01:23:53,002 --> 01:23:55,420
if we're going to make it to the press conference.

1166
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:07,307
I want to read you something from my speech before we go.

1167
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,479
"We must not give in to the fear.

1168
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,399
We must face those things we fear the most.

1169
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:17,901
We must appeaI to our better angels. "

1170
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:20,028
Too much?

1171
01:24:20,196 --> 01:24:22,114
I'm sorry.

1172
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:25,868
It's just before, when you asked if we brought this on ourselves-

1173
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:28,120
we didn't.

1174
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,872
I did.

1175
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:36,044
When I was young, I really wanted to change the system.

1176
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:40,883
You know, I was ready to fight. I was gonna be the best no matter what.

1177
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:43,260
You give an inch here, you give an inch there,

1178
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:46,096
you get caught up in the game.

1179
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:49,766
And then you realize that the system that you're trying to change-

1180
01:24:49,934 --> 01:24:52,436
it changed you.

1181
01:24:52,604 --> 01:24:54,521
Jonas, I've lost my way somewhere.

1182
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:57,191
Look, remember what I told you?

1183
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:01,028
The hard part isn't making the decision.

1184
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:05,115
It's living with it.

1185
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,496
Man: Everybody stay sharp.

1186
01:25:11,664 --> 01:25:13,248
We're on the move.

1187
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:36,325
- We all right? - Dunnigan: It's dead.

1188
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:38,512
Electrical system's fried.

1189
01:26:38,557 --> 01:26:40,844
Man over radio: What's going on back there?

1190
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:46,230
Dunnigan, tell them to get Jonas away from here.

1191
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,429
What the fuck is that?

1192
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,287
Get down, get down!

1193
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:26,673
Jonas! Jonas!

1194
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,301
- Jonas! Jonas! - No, Nick! Get back!

1195
01:27:30,762 --> 01:27:33,096
Nick: Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1196
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:35,932
Jonas! Get out of the car! Jonas!

1197
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,185
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1198
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:39,770
Dunnigan: Please listen to me!

1199
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:48,362
Jonas!

1200
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,322
Jonas.

1201
01:28:10,843 --> 01:28:13,809
I told you to handle this.

1202
01:28:13,843 --> 01:28:15,741
You didn't.

1203
01:28:15,776 --> 01:28:17,469
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1204
01:28:17,509 --> 01:28:21,033
that's managed to bring this entire city to its knees.

1205
01:28:22,143 --> 01:28:24,734
One of my friends was just murdered.

1206
01:28:25,743 --> 01:28:29,835
More than one of my friends is gone, Mayor.

1207
01:28:29,876 --> 01:28:32,774
What I should do is fire you.

1208
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:35,174
Hmm? Right now.

1209
01:28:36,243 --> 01:28:39,175
I resign.

1210
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:43,472
- Is that your real answer? - I think that's best.

1211
01:28:48,177 --> 01:28:49,643
No.

1212
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:53,403
I'm not gonna allow that to happen. Bring me the Bible.

1213
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:58,068
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1214
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,542
As of now, you're acting District Attorney.

1215
01:29:00,577 --> 01:29:03,668
We'll have a formal swearing in later.

1216
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:07,073
For now this will suffice. Stand up.

1217
01:29:08,644 --> 01:29:11,303
Put your left hand on the Bible. Raise your right hand.

1218
01:29:11,343 --> 01:29:13,309
Repeat after me.

1219
01:29:13,343 --> 01:29:15,400
- I, Nicolas Rice... - I, Nicolas Rice...

1220
01:29:15,443 --> 01:29:17,568
- ... do solemnly swear... - ... do solemnly swear...

1221
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:19,633
- ... that I will support... - ... that I will support...

1222
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:20,938
- ... obey... - ... obey...

1223
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:23,602
...and defend the Constitution of the United States...

1224
01:29:23,644 --> 01:29:25,667
...and defend the Constitution of the United States...

1225
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:28,835
...and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1226
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,474
People aren't going to work; kids aren't going to schooI.

1227
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:43,101
They're scared, and I don't blame them.

1228
01:29:43,269 --> 01:29:47,481
So I'm implementing the emergency provision of the Philadelphia code.

1229
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:48,940
We're gonna lock this city down.

1230
01:29:49,108 --> 01:29:52,277
Starting now, no one moves in this city unrestricted.

1231
01:29:52,737 --> 01:29:55,071
I want a show of force for the public-

1232
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:57,824
uniforms, detectives, 12-hour shifts.

1233
01:29:57,992 --> 01:29:59,868
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1234
01:30:00,036 --> 01:30:02,662
If you have to give shotguns to the meter maids, do it.

1235
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,915
There should be no doubt in people's minds

1236
01:30:05,082 --> 01:30:08,376
that this city is secure and under our control.

1237
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,089
Okay.

1238
01:30:18,638 --> 01:30:22,307
Okay, Clyde. I get it.

1239
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,105
Dunnigan: Listen, that contraption that killed Cantrell,

1240
01:30:29,273 --> 01:30:32,526
it was a weaponized bomb-disposal robot.

1241
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:33,735
Can you believe that?

1242
01:30:33,903 --> 01:30:36,821
Damn thing had video, night vision- you name it.

1243
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:40,116
It's like military APl, for Christ's sakes.

1244
01:30:40,284 --> 01:30:43,161
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1245
01:30:43,329 --> 01:30:45,247
I think he's saving you for last.

1246
01:30:47,917 --> 01:30:50,293
Nick, I'm serious.

1247
01:30:51,963 --> 01:30:54,881
I appreciate the insight.

1248
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:01,972
Nick, you gotta get in front of this guy if you want to stay alive.

1249
01:31:04,809 --> 01:31:06,851
I may have a way-

1250
01:31:07,019 --> 01:31:10,605
something a friend is helping me out with.

1251
01:31:10,773 --> 01:31:12,148
Who's your friend?

1252
01:31:12,316 --> 01:31:14,943
A friend named Chester. I'll call you back.

1253
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:18,989
Thank you, Sarah.

1254
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:29,124
This is Nick. Give me the real-estate listing

1255
01:31:29,292 --> 01:31:32,711
of every industrial property sold here in the last 10 years.

1256
01:31:58,237 --> 01:32:00,655
Motherfucker.

1257
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:20,800
You're kidding me, right?

1258
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,220
You're saying Clyde owns this place?

1259
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:27,307
Something about it sticks out, right?

1260
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:29,392
Yeah.

1261
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,732
What- are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?

1262
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:40,487
- What about his civil rights? - Fuck his civiI rights.

1263
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:45,325
Yes!

1264
01:33:30,287 --> 01:33:32,706
There's got to be something in here.

1265
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:34,582
Dunnigan: Yeah.

1266
01:33:50,307 --> 01:33:52,934
Remember this from outside the house?

1267
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:01,443
Yeah.

1268
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,486
Get that right there.

1269
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,797
Dunnigan: Un-fucking-believable.

1270
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:38,730
Look at this.

1271
01:34:44,028 --> 01:34:45,904
Nick: Watch your step.

1272
01:34:51,243 --> 01:34:53,870
This guy tunneled into prison?

1273
01:35:21,565 --> 01:35:23,858
Nick: Oh, shit.

1274
01:35:28,781 --> 01:35:30,782
Dunnigan: Fuck- Semtex.

1275
01:35:35,037 --> 01:35:38,665
Got police uniforms, other disguises.

1276
01:36:02,273 --> 01:36:04,315
Nick: He tunneled into every cell.

1277
01:36:05,317 --> 01:36:07,026
Over here.

1278
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:15,910
He wanted to be transferred to solitary.

1279
01:36:16,078 --> 01:36:18,788
Surprise, motherfucker.

1280
01:37:01,707 --> 01:37:04,834
- He's not here! - If he's not there, then where is he?

1281
01:37:10,549 --> 01:37:12,175
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1282
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:13,843
Oh, long story.

1283
01:37:14,011 --> 01:37:16,971
Stop right there, sir.

1284
01:37:17,139 --> 01:37:19,265
Let me see your ID, please.

1285
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,476
- Yeah, sure. - Thank you.

1286
01:37:21,644 --> 01:37:24,187
Turn around, sir. Extend your arms.

1287
01:37:25,898 --> 01:37:27,523
Something going on tonight?

1288
01:37:27,691 --> 01:37:31,110
- The mayor. - Mmm, mayor.

1289
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:40,620
Look at this.

1290
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:43,247
He tapped into the prison cameras.

1291
01:37:43,415 --> 01:37:45,500
Jesus, he's got cameras everywhere.

1292
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,418
- Shit. - Is that your house?

1293
01:37:47,586 --> 01:37:50,421
Yes.

1294
01:37:51,423 --> 01:37:53,883
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

1295
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:55,510
Denise- where is she?

1296
01:37:55,678 --> 01:37:57,387
Is she with you? Are you sure?

1297
01:37:57,554 --> 01:37:59,305
Okay.

1298
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:01,933
Stay where you are. I'll explain later.

1299
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:03,935
I love you.

1300
01:38:10,946 --> 01:38:13,855


1301
01:38:13,946 --> 01:38:16,155
Nick: Von Clausewitz.

1302
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,203
Look at that.

1303
01:38:29,586 --> 01:38:31,379
He's at City Hall.

1304
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:34,924
You're free to go, sir.

1305
01:38:35,092 --> 01:38:38,094
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. - No, don't worry about it.

1306
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:42,140
Better to be safe than sorry, right?

1307
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,643
Dunnigan: Get ready to evacuate the building.

1308
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:47,812
We'll need a tactical unit and a bomb squad.

1309
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,230
Bad idea. Have them come in soft.

1310
01:38:49,398 --> 01:38:52,066
If Shelton spots them or any of us, we're fucked.

1311
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:18,134
Hey.

1312
01:39:20,679 --> 01:39:22,305
- Where's the tactical team? - En route.

1313
01:39:22,473 --> 01:39:24,682
- They're coming in soft- no sirens. - Bomb squad?

1314
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:26,392
You're looking at it.

1315
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,854
Right, okay. We take the north surge; you take the west.

1316
01:39:30,022 --> 01:39:31,439
We'll call.

1317
01:39:36,487 --> 01:39:38,071
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa. - IDs, please.

1318
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:40,656
- He's the fucking DA. - Good for him. IDs, please.

1319
01:39:40,824 --> 01:39:42,825
What's going on here tonight?

1320
01:39:42,993 --> 01:39:45,203
- Security meeting with all the brass. - What floor?

1321
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,288
6th floor- caucus room.

1322
01:39:50,209 --> 01:39:53,961
- What floor is this? - That's the 5th floor, sir.

1323
01:39:54,129 --> 01:39:56,172
Directly below the caucus room.

1324
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,093
You catch this motherfucker red-handed, we gotta take him alive.

1325
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:24,033
Where is he?

1326
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:26,786
What the fuck are we looking for?

1327
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:29,038
Wait wait wait.

1328
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:30,414
Right there.

1329
01:40:30,582 --> 01:40:33,292
Garza: Stand back. Don't touch anything.

1330
01:40:34,586 --> 01:40:37,338
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1331
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:18,337
Can I see your ID, please?

1332
01:41:25,387 --> 01:41:27,763
All right, next car, pull forward!

1333
01:42:02,299 --> 01:42:05,843
Garza: Malglinite.

1334
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:08,512
That's napalm, basically. This shit'll take out the entire floor

1335
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,514
and the one above us.

1336
01:42:10,682 --> 01:42:14,685
Looks like it's- looks like it's triggered by this cell phone here.

1337
01:42:14,853 --> 01:42:18,981
What? So an incoming call arms it?

1338
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:23,110
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds till boom time.

1339
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:26,405
- Jesus. - Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1340
01:42:26,573 --> 01:42:28,241
- I'm calling the mayor's security. - We can't.

1341
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:31,786
Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate and he will detonate this thing.

1342
01:42:31,954 --> 01:42:34,580
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1343
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:39,335
So what do we do?

1344
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,347
Man: Wait a second.

1345
01:42:51,515 --> 01:42:53,391
We've got something.

1346
01:42:53,558 --> 01:42:55,393
Man over radio: He's pulling up.

1347
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:19,583
Man: Mayor April Henry.

1348
01:43:29,177 --> 01:43:31,846
Thank you for coming in on short notice.

1349
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:40,021
Mayor: I have one simple question.

1350
01:43:42,482 --> 01:43:45,484
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1351
01:43:47,446 --> 01:43:49,572
Now I refuse to believe

1352
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:54,160
that one man is smarter than Homeland Security,

1353
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:58,748
the FBl, the sheriff's department, or Philly PD.

1354
01:43:58,915 --> 01:44:01,167
I don't care how we do it, or what kind

1355
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:04,587
of obscure legaI justification we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1356
01:44:04,755 --> 01:44:07,798
I don't care what laws we have to bend.

1357
01:44:07,966 --> 01:44:11,886
I am sure that there is a provision of the Homeland Security Act

1358
01:44:12,054 --> 01:44:14,638
that we can activate.

1359
01:44:14,806 --> 01:44:17,933
Just get him out of here by tomorrow.

1360
01:44:24,649 --> 01:44:26,150
Nick: Clyde?

1361
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,782
Nick.

1362
01:44:32,949 --> 01:44:34,867
I wasn't expecting company.

1363
01:44:38,288 --> 01:44:41,415
Yeah, I would have- I would have cleaned up a little.

1364
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:44,377
Never seen anybody tunnel into prison before.

1365
01:44:50,175 --> 01:44:54,136
And the solitary confinement? That was clever.

1366
01:44:54,304 --> 01:44:56,639
Well, that's how winners play.

1367
01:44:56,807 --> 01:44:59,975
We convince the other guy he's making all the right moves.

1368
01:45:00,977 --> 01:45:03,479
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1369
01:45:03,647 --> 01:45:05,314
Yeah, I did.

1370
01:45:05,482 --> 01:45:07,858
It's the end of the road for you now.

1371
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,865
You played us, Clyde. You played us real good.

1372
01:45:15,033 --> 01:45:16,909
Thank you.

1373
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:20,121
You know, I'm glad you finally get to appreciate

1374
01:45:20,288 --> 01:45:22,206
some of the effort that I put into all of this.

1375
01:45:22,374 --> 01:45:24,625
Well, you set out to make a point, Clyde.

1376
01:45:24,793 --> 01:45:25,876
You made it.

1377
01:45:26,044 --> 01:45:27,753
No, people still don't get it.

1378
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:31,674
They don't appreciate what I'm trying to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1379
01:45:31,842 --> 01:45:33,717
A man I cared about once told me

1380
01:45:33,885 --> 01:45:36,053
that we can't retract the decisions that we've made,

1381
01:45:36,221 --> 01:45:38,764
we can only affect the decisions we're going to make from here.

1382
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:41,725
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick? - I'm giving you a way out.

1383
01:45:41,893 --> 01:45:43,519
Big difference.

1384
01:45:43,687 --> 01:45:45,771
Stand up for those principles you've been preaching.

1385
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:49,525
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde. That includes you.

1386
01:45:49,693 --> 01:45:51,360
Why don't we do the right thing here?

1387
01:45:52,362 --> 01:45:54,864
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

1388
01:45:56,867 --> 01:45:58,534
You just have to see it that way.

1389
01:45:58,702 --> 01:46:00,077
By murdering all those people,

1390
01:46:00,245 --> 01:46:03,080
all you're doing is destroying the memory of your daughter

1391
01:46:03,248 --> 01:46:06,792
and causing the same pain that you're suffering from.

1392
01:46:13,508 --> 01:46:17,928
So what do you suggest, Nick? Make another deaI?

1393
01:46:18,096 --> 01:46:21,182
One finaI offer? Is that what it is?

1394
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:27,813
I don't make deals with murderers anymore, Clyde.

1395
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:29,982
You taught me that.

1396
01:46:34,529 --> 01:46:38,240
Finally.

1397
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:42,995
Well done. Bravo.

1398
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:46,123
Maybe I wasn't such a bad teacher after all.

1399
01:46:46,291 --> 01:46:48,501
If you go through with this, Clyde, it's a decision

1400
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:51,253
you'll have to live with for the rest of your life.

1401
01:47:15,111 --> 01:47:16,987
I'm sorry, Nick.

1402
01:47:19,658 --> 01:47:21,575
Me too.

1403
01:47:31,753 --> 01:47:33,629
Like I said, Clyde,

1404
01:47:33,797 --> 01:47:36,757
it's a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life,

1405
01:47:36,925 --> 01:47:40,261
which I figure by now is about 25 more seconds.

1406
01:50:46,925 --> 01:50:55,261


1407
01:51:10,305 --> 01:51:12,848
# Ain't seen a night #

1408
01:51:13,016 --> 01:51:15,684
# Things work out right #

1409
01:51:15,852 --> 01:51:19,229
# Go by #

1410
01:51:21,357 --> 01:51:23,734
# Things on my mind #

1411
01:51:23,902 --> 01:51:26,361
# And I just don't have the time #

1412
01:51:26,529 --> 01:51:29,990
# And it don't seem right #

1413
01:51:32,744 --> 01:51:34,828
# Ain't seen a day #

1414
01:51:34,996 --> 01:51:37,790
# That I don't hear people say #

1415
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:41,043
# They know they're gonna die #

1416
01:51:44,088 --> 01:51:46,965
# This may seem a little bit crazy #

1417
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:51,345
# But I don't think you should be so lazy #

1418
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:57,810
# If you think you've heard this before #

1419
01:51:57,977 --> 01:51:59,812
# Well, stick around #

1420
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:03,690
# I'm gonna tell you more #

1421
01:53:30,278 --> 01:53:33,113
# One just like the other #

1422
01:53:33,281 --> 01:53:35,240
# Sin's a good man's brother #

1423
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:39,119
# But is that right? #

1424
01:53:41,539 --> 01:53:44,041
# You tell me that I don't #

1425
01:53:44,208 --> 01:53:46,418
# Then I say I won't #

1426
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:50,339
# But then I might #

1427
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:55,761
# You said this is the way it's supposed to be #

1428
01:53:55,929 --> 01:53:58,430
# But it just don't seem right to me #

1429
01:53:58,598 --> 01:54:02,559
# And that's outta sight #

1430
01:54:04,145 --> 01:54:07,064
# Some folks need an education #

1431
01:54:07,231 --> 01:54:11,610
# Don't give up or we'll lose the nation #

1432
01:54:15,531 --> 01:54:18,283
# You say we need a revolution? #

1433
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:19,785
# It seems to be #

1434
01:54:19,953 --> 01:54:23,914
# The only solution. #
