1
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,437
Okay, Miss Mike, you're in.

2
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,364
Watch your ass.

3
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,454
Definitely Taliban presence here.

4
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,082
Not a lot, but they're here. Over.

5
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,544
If you see Bin Laden, You can
give him a big New York kiss.

6
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,297
Then chop his nuts off. He
can wear them as earrings.

7
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,299
Roger that.

8
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,886
Some old guy is making eyes at me.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,805
God damn!

10
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,557
I can't see anything out of this.

11
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,767
You should bring that
outfit back to the States,

12
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,644
you can wear it again for Halloween.

13
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,188
Next time, you're wearing the dress.

14
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,859
Craig, I've got a
problem with the old guy.

15
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,402
Take it easy.

16
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,656
He's not taking his eyes
off me, This guy knows.

17
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,950
I think he knows.
- Hang in there, Mike.

18
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,476
Control, we have an unexpected
visitor. Request positive I.D. Over.

19
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,936
Go.

20
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,067
Visitor is a friendly VIP.

21
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,029
Repeat, visitor is a CIA contractor.

22
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,114
Abort mission. Over.

23
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,664
This is not good. Craig, do you read?

24
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,208
I'm in deep shit, man.

25
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,168
The old man's ratting me out.

26
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,796
Did you get that?

27
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,132
Captain McCenzie, do you understand me?

28
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,426
You are to abort this mission.

29
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,856
If you're in trouble and
you can't speak, just cough.

30
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,380
What the hell are you
doing here, soldier?

31
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,050
Where's the rest of your unit?

32
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,763
Listen, these ragheads would
love to slit your throat.

33
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,223
Now, I need to know how
many of you there are

34
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,727
and what you're doing here, so
I can try to save your necks.

35
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,565
You just don't get it, do you?

36
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,342
Let me spell it out to you.

37
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,221
I work for CIA.

38
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,599
I cannot allow one lost soldier

39
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,352
to compromise my entire operation.

40
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,357
Okay, your choice.

41
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,293
You know what I think, soldier?

42
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,589
I think you are dressed like a woman,

43
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,427
because secretly you
don't want to be a man.

44
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,002
Captain McCenzie, your orders are
to stand down. You are not to...

45
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,006
Now, when I'm done cutting you,

46
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,218
these boys will finish
making a woman of you.

47
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,809
Boy, am I glad to see you.

48
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:56,935
Craig!

49
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,194
You all right?

50
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,612
Oh, man!

51
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,448
My wife is gonna be relieved.

52
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,492
But control is gonna
cut your balls off, man.

53
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,535
That guy was CIA.

54
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,123
It seems to me, you party with the
devil, God ain't ever gonna help you.

55
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,917
Come on, let's go.

56
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,514
I'm all in.

57
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,100
Come on, let's see what you've got.

58
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,986
How about you give me a loan

59
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,779
and hold on to my bike as collateral?

60
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,447
When are you going to learn, soldier?

61
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,449
You're out of luck, not cash.

62
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,035
I've never seen anyone
unluckier than you.

63
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,790
So, how did you get out
of the army alive, anyway?

64
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,168
You know what they say, "Lucky in war,

65
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,713
unlucky in life."

66
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,553
So how about the loan?

67
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,516
There you go, soldier. A
nation's grateful thanks.

68
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,353
Until the end of the month.

69
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,023
Deal.

70
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,698
All right, hands on
the table. Nobody move!

71
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,408
Cool it, kid. What's the problem?

72
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,909
The problem?

73
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,246
Two aces of spades?
<i>-</i> lt's just a silly mistake.

74
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,040
You stacked the deck, Tony?

75
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,250
I let you win every once in a while.

76
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,757
Didn't you hear what my friend said?

77
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,008
Put your hands on the table.

78
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,802
Trust me, this is not the
way you want to resolve this.

79
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,056
Shut up, all right? You think you can
cheat us like your loser buddy over here?

80
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,974
We're taking the money.

81
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,230
Look, kid,just take the money
and get the hell out of here.

82
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,857
Lucida, give them your purse.

83
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,151
All right, put the money in the bag.

84
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,322
Jeez!

85
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,366
All right, you're next, cowboy.

86
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,743
Your turn. Put the money in the bag.

87
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,828
Put the money in the bag!

88
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,962
All of it.

89
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,715
All of it.

90
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,478
You can put the gun down now.
It's only loaded with blanks.

91
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,188
Really? Let's check!

92
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,357
You really want me to pull this trigger?

93
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,693
Let her go, McCenzie.

94
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,153
Hey! What the hell is going on?

95
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,709
What the hell is going on?

96
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,919
They hired stunt guys.

97
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,882
They want to do business with you.

98
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,724
Just wanted to see if you
still had it in you, soldier.

99
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,604
Captain McCenzie, we
need a man like you.

100
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,946
Well, I don't need you.
All I want is my loan.

101
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,533
Thanks for the show.

102
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,910
Crazy.

103
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,789
We'll do it your way, Sister.

104
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,459
Trust me, little brother.

105
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,220
Cheers.

106
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,601
So, what do you think they wanted?

107
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,355
There's only one thing I'm good at.

108
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,862
You know, Craig. I'm so broke, man.

109
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,993
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make some money.

110
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,245
Anything. Anything.

111
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:12,125
The banks, fucking banks, they
already took everything, you know?

112
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,924
There's no work here, man.
There's nothing for a man

113
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,177
der unehrenhaft aus der
Armee entlassen wurde.

114
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,433
We both fought for our country,
Mike, we got nothing for it.

115
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,772
Well, maybe now we need to
start fighting for some money.

116
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,234
Some of the guys from the old
unit are pulling in loads of cash

117
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,653
as mercs in Mexico.

118
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,196
And then...

119
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,450
Hey, baby. What are you doing up?

120
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,204
It's not me who can't sleep, Daddy.

121
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,373
It's Winston.

122
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,418
Come on, darling. Let's
get Winston back to bed.

123
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,712
Look at that, look at
what your nuts made.

124
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,591
I saved those nuts.
<i>-</i> Good night, Daddy. Good night, Craig.

125
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,638
Good night, guys.
- Good night.

126
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,060
You love Joanna and Elize?

127
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,688
Of course.

128
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,982
Then forget about fighting.

129
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,609
We'll find some other
way to make some money.

130
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,863
I've got about two more weeks before
the banks change the locks on my doors.

131
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,997
Soliders of Fortune.

132
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,791
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

133
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,918
If you've received this link,

134
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,795
then your net worth pre-qualifies you

135
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,506
for the Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

136
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,134
the ultimate in extreme vacationing.

137
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,096
On your adventure mission you'll
experience the adrenalin rush of combat

138
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,890
in an actual war zone,

139
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,309
but without the risk
of losing your life.

140
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,270
After all, you've worked
too hard for your millions

141
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,647
not to enjoy them until a ripe old age.

142
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,150
Whether you're sniping
enemy mercenaries,

143
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,360
clandestinely delivering
a cache of weapons,

144
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,154
or blowing up a compound,

145
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,655
you'll be protected
every step of the way

146
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,658
by our qualified action teams.

147
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,538
Every member on our staff
is a highly decorated

148
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,624
special operations veteran.

149
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,459
You prove your manhood,

150
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,836
they ensure your complete safety.

151
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,632
All the proceeds support the freedom
fighters of a small island nation.

152
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,300
And, unlike other charities,

153
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,553
you'll be able to personally oversee
how your contribution is delivered.

154
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,515
While your peers boast about
that luxury cruise in the Caymans,

155
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,019
you fought for liberty
and freedom in a war zone.

156
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,898
We offer the ultimate
in bragging rights.

157
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,569
And the best part is,
it's all tax deductable.

158
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,727
Would you knock it off?
I'm trying to sleep.

159
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,270
Good morning.

160
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,358
Have you had breakfast yet?

161
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,947
You know, I'm warning you,
you're wasting your time.

162
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,908
Sit down, Craig.

163
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,328
How's business. Slow?

164
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,123
Thriving.

165
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,543
Now!

166
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,379
Whoa! Nice!

167
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,799
So how's your brother's beak?

168
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,552
Who told you Ernesto is my brother?

169
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,595
Thank you.

170
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,848
How did you find me, the Yellow Pages?

171
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,559
I know almost everything about you.

172
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,979
Captain Craig James McCenzie.

173
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,817
Twenty-three special ops and not
one soldier dead under your command.

174
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,028
You were a legend.

175
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,989
And then you were court-martialed
for insubordination

176
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,366
and unbecoming conduct.
- That's old news.

177
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,994
And dishonorably discharged.
- No, no, no.

178
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,039
There's nothing dishonorable about
saving your best friend's testicles.

179
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,042
Your unit was disbanded in disgrace.

180
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,086
I can just imagine how many
people told you thanks for that

181
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,798
Just one guy, and his
wife. That's plenty for me.

182
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,676
Look, thank you for the breakfast, but,

183
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,928
I got some things I gotta do.

184
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,518
You lost everything because of this man.

185
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,854
Carter Mason.

186
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,274
All right, look, no more games.
Who the hell do you work for?

187
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,777
We're not playing
games. We need your help.

188
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,906
And you need the money. Your
friend, Captain Reed, needs it.

189
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,575
I am through with fighting.

190
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,703
That's good. Because we don't
need you to kill anybody.

191
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,414
We need you to make
sure nobody gets killed.

192
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,208
You want me to protect him?

193
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,377
No, we need you to protect
some people from him.

194
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,804
And this man is Colonel Lupo.

195
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,055
Nice casting.

196
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,686
In Eastern Europe, by the
northern seaboard of the Black Sea,

197
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:27,315
is Ostriv Zmiinyi, also
known as Snake Island.

198
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,694
Its mountains are rich in
minerals and rare Earth metals.

199
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,199
During the Cold War, there was
an Allied military base there.

200
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,620
Now nobody knows who owns
it, Romania or Ukraine.

201
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,914
So it's no man's land.

202
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:48,086
Colonel Lupo seized power there four
years ago with a mercenary force.

203
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,755
His head of security is Mason.

204
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,469
Colonel Lupo's regime
is brutal and oppressive.

205
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,767
They kill anyone who dares
to speak up against Lupo.

206
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,979
There is a resistance,

207
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,314
but we don't have the weapons to fight.

208
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,525
Our freedom fighters have been unable

209
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,610
to resist Colonel Lupo's mercenaries.

210
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,156
All, criminals on the
run. The scum of the Earth.

211
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:20,076
They make life a living hell
for the people of Ostriv Zmiinyi.

212
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,911
So, who's the girl?

213
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,413
That's Magda,

214
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,373
she's Colonel Lupo's daughter,

215
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,209
and the only person he cares for.

216
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,253
She's pure evil.

217
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,224
As long as Lupo finds buyers
for the island's metals

218
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,479
he can finance his mercenaries
and brutalize the people.

219
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,858
All right, so those are the bad guys.

220
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,194
Who are the good guys? You?

221
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,325
I was born on the island.
I want to set it free.

222
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,370
The resistance is dying,
but now there is hope.

223
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,623
Ernesto and I

224
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,043
have found five very rich
men who are willing to help.

225
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,922
You know something, lady?
I've never met a rich guy

226
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,216
who's willing to give
away something for nothing.

227
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,343
What do your backers
want for their money?

228
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,596
Kicks and thrills.

229
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,808
With our Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

230
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,896
we've set up a basic training
camp for our clients in Romania.

231
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,190
With their charitable contributions,

232
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:36,444
we've purchased the firepower
to finally resist Colonel Lupo.

233
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,991
Ernesto leased a ship
to transport the weapons.

234
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,118
We know that Lupo's mercenaries

235
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,538
do not patrol the uninhabited
east side of the island.

236
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,750
Our financiers'
adventure mission will be

237
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,169
to escort the weapons to shore

238
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,463
and get them to the resistance base camp

239
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,299
protected by bodyguards at all times.

240
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,551
Wait a second, let me get this straight.

241
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,179
You and Ernesto are
pimping out your revolution

242
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,890
as some kind of tourist attraction
for a bunch of millionaires,

243
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,226
and you expect me to be your guide?

244
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,687
Yes. We need your credentials

245
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,856
to assure our clients of their safety.

246
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,943
One last op, Craig.

247
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,237
You're lucky in war,
you said so yourself.

248
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,864
With you, everybody comes home.

249
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:32,333
Our clients will never be
near actual combat, Craig.

250
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,128
And you can save your friend's home.

251
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,922
And everybody will be happy.

252
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,193
Our wealthy warriors have arrived.

253
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,237
Tell me what we're dealing with.

254
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,824
The first of our soldiers of fortune

255
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,201
is Charles Herbert Vanderbeer.

256
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,663
Vanderbeer is a genuine
American aristocrat.

257
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,208
One of his ancestors bought
Manhattan from a drunk Indian

258
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,836
for twenty-four silver dollars
and a bottle of moonshine.

259
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,047
Vanderbeer runs a
Wall Street hedge fund.

260
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,174
He made a fortune from subprime loans,

261
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,509
and then another from the bank bailout.

262
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,971
It's a shame a lot of ordinary
folks lost their homes,

263
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,765
but that's Wall Street for you.

264
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,560
The rich get richer and
the poor can go to hell.

265
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,771
I'm gonna enjoy watching him under fire.

266
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:38,900
Our second millionaire is Roman
St.John. A metals magnate.

267
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,196
St. John traded vodka and
bluejeans on the black market

268
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,031
before the Berlin Wall fell.

269
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,949
And then, in the anarchy
that followed somehow

270
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,453
all his business rivals got
murdered but he survived

271
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,415
Now he owns a huge
mining and smelting empire

272
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,959
and lives the life of
an international playboy.

273
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,588
He was last sighted off the
coast of Somalia, fishing.

274
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,883
St.John does have
practical weapons exposure,

275
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,555
but he claims, without any
verifiable military record

276
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:15,103
that he has experience leading
troops in naval warfare.

277
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:20,817
He demanded an entourage
of five. He settled for one.

278
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,903
Our next client is Sam Haussmann.

279
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,740
I've heard of this guy.
- Who hasn't?

280
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,953
A cell phone pioneer and a
permanent resident on Forbes List.

281
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,705
Haussmann's lived enough
for three ordinary men.

282
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,878
He's been married five
times, he has eight kids.

283
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,383
He's made two huge
fortunes and lost one.

284
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,552
He's climbed Everest and fought bulls

285
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,595
and hunted every kind of big game.

286
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,973
Even three species that are now extinct.

287
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,643
And he's beaten two major
heart attacks, as well.

288
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,484
And now for the bad. Our fourth client.

289
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,445
The Grim Reaper.

290
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,324
Grimaud Tourneur. Born in French Africa.

291
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,494
Very little is known about this
international man of mystery,

292
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,831
before becoming the world's
most notorious arms dealer.

293
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:22,295
Our angel of death sold weapons to
both sides in the civil war in Sudan.

294
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,630
Then he started a revolution in Congo

295
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,549
just to peddle more guns.

296
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:30,386
Grimaud makes even mercenaries
seem like Sisters of Mercy.

297
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,430
He's a profiteer of war,

298
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,057
but he's never participated in one.

299
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,852
He's selling our new friends
their weapons, as well.

300
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,148
And finally, at the bottom of
the barrel, we have Tommy Sin.

301
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:48,321
Sin is the creator of Death Porn,
the mega-violent fantasy video game.

302
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,575
Five teenagers decapitated their parents

303
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,702
after playing his smash hit game.

304
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,538
But each time Sin is accused
of incitement to murder

305
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,873
he's acquitted.

306
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,667
Sin probably thinks
war is just a game, too.

307
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,420
Apart from his addiction to video games,

308
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,508
this lunatic just broke his leg.

309
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,781
Welcome to our training camp, gentlemen.

310
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,867
I'm Captain McCenzie,
this is Captain Reed.

311
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,537
These five men are going
to be your bodyguards.

312
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,872
You will obey their every command.

313
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,542
Whose buck is this?

314
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,212
How about they obey our orders?

315
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,090
If any of them is going
to be my bodyguard,

316
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,176
it is they who need
the training, not me.

317
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,137
Yes, sir, Captain, sir.

318
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,223
Three bags full, sir.

319
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,020
The barracks over there are
going to be your accommodations.

320
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,480
Uh, excuse me.

321
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,067
Uh, I trust we all have
our own rooms. I mean...

322
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,321
Over the next few
days you're gonna learn

323
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,532
how to survive in a hot zone.

324
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,075
Just remember,

325
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,120
the only thing worse in action
than a coward is a hero. You got it?

326
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,582
Now, go stow your bags. Dismissed.

327
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,418
Oh, hey, uh, General? Uh, Colonel?

328
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:30,464
Can, uh, can someone carry my
bag for me, 'cause my leg's done.

329
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,844
I can't I can't carry it.

330
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,346
Got a bum leg!

331
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,895
Jesus!

332
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:54,655
Jesus Christ. No, I told you
about the fucking pharmacy.

333
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,844
Oh, it's like that, huh?

334
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,812
Helen and I will take the dining room.

335
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:49,502
What you playing there, son?
- Baby Killer. On the top level.

336
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,629
I'm in the maternity ward.

337
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,638
Hey, Grimaud, can you feel it?

338
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,473
Feel what?

339
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,392
The thrill of being a kid again.

340
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,561
Playing war games with
pop guns in your backyard.

341
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,605
This isn't a kids' game.

342
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,983
We're playing with real weapons now.

343
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,281
The Grim Reaper.

344
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:22,910
Hmm, big gun.

345
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,995
It's small.

346
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,706
Son, you know

347
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,208
it's not the size of
your gun that matters,

348
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,168
it's where you stick it.

349
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,046
Let me show you a real hunter's weapon.

350
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,300
Now this, here, is Irene.

351
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,927
Irene's a bitch.

352
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,389
She would have sniped that Grim
Reaper of yours at a thousand yards

353
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,766
before you even knew she was there.

354
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,893
Oh, that's nice. May I?
- Yeah, sure.

355
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,228
Oh, thanks!

356
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,323
What're you doing?

357
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,285
Idiot.

358
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,455
You know,

359
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,541
I lost twenty-million dollars

360
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,461
when Lehman Brothers
collapsed on Wall Street.

361
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,213
Sucker

362
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,506
Uh, yeah?

363
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,842
Screw you, too, banker.

364
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,722
Screw you, too, game boy.

365
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,684
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Simmer
down! Simmer down now, boys.

366
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,269
Take it easy, big fella.

367
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,689
How about we have a party

368
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,984
to celebrate you two
losing your cherries.

369
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,111
I agree.

370
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,464
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

371
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,633
Cheers.
<i>-</i> Here's mud in your eye.

372
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:13,229
1975! Damn, that was a vintage year.

373
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,147
Was she that pretty, Sam?

374
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:19,777
Yeah, well, whatever she was,
she's probably a grandmother by now.

375
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,862
Here's to good living!

376
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,657
And a quick death.
<i>-</i> Cheers, Sam.

377
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,661
Champagne, sir?

378
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:32,998
Thank you.

379
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:46,637
I bet you I kill more
bad guys than you do.

380
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,019
Make it a hundred grand and you're on.

381
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,730
A hundred thousand? Deal.

382
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,108
I bet a million bucks

383
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,026
you both get blue balls.

384
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,280
Neither of you are man
enough to kill a man for real.

385
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:09,368
It's a draw.

386
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,707
I hate a party when I'm not invited.

387
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,834
Let 'em have their fun.

388
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,086
We're getting paid, aren't we?

389
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,755
You know, those bastards are right.

390
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,341
Their bodyguards do need to train.

391
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,349
You look like an angel. An
angel when you're dancing, angel.

392
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,772
How is your hedge fund?

393
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,275
Fine.

394
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,528
Why do you ask?

395
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,033
Nothing.

396
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,744
I just heard some rumors, that's all.

397
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:56,457
You know, how when the tide
goes out, the wrecks get exposed?

398
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,044
Nonsense.

399
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:04,423
Ich mag die Art, wie du dich
bewegst, Méidchen. Oh, du bewegst mich.

400
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,927
Hey!
Videoboy!

401
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,814
Damn. We're being attacked!

402
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,026
Let's make a run for it.

403
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,961
Gentlemen! Your throats
have all been cut.

404
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,090
Sorry to interrupt your party,

405
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,927
but, after all, you did say that
your bodyguards do need to train.

406
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,388
Thank you, bodyguards.

407
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,769
Now at least we know who
the most vulnerable are.

408
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,647
Vanderbeer and Sin will be
killed on our first contact.

409
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,191
Grim doesn't stand much of a chance.

410
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:09,029
And, uh, Haussmann and St.John,
I don't see them lasting very long.

411
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,532
Thank you, gentlemen.
If anybody is interested,

412
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,701
training begins
at oh-six-hundred

413
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,121
That's, like, six in
the morning, isn't it?

414
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,008
Do you think your adrenalin
junkies will show up?

415
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,885
If they don't, let's just go home.

416
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,597
I got a bad feeling
about this op, anyway.

417
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,934
Oh, shit.

418
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,443
What happened to your lady?

419
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:52,740
I, uh, I sent her away.
It's time for business.

420
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,703
What about you? Huh? What
did you do with your valet?

421
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:01,206
I, uh, gave him a vacation.

422
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:08,630
He's been asking for, uh, well, years.

423
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,680
All right, let's get started.

424
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,308
Drop and give me fifty.

425
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,103
Drop!

426
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,903
There you go, boys. Kiss that anthill.

427
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,869
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it.

428
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,081
Come on, kick ass! Let's go, Vanderbeer.

429
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,001
Now, Haussmann, get your ass
over that wall. Let's go! Come on!

430
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,379
Move it! Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

431
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,298
Move your ass! Move your ass!

432
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,949
Come on, Haussmann, move your
ass! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

433
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,617
What's that noise?

434
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,953
What are you doing?
What the hell is that?

435
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,496
Is that a phone?

436
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,165
Hey, Alma. What did you do now?

437
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,590
Hang up that phone! Hang up that phone!

438
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,675
Uh, I'll call you back.

439
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,928
You do that again, I'll kill
you myself. Come on! Move it!

440
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,930
You're moving like a senior citizen.

441
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,684
Come on, Vanderbeer. Your
valet's not here to do it for you.

442
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,678
Work with your bodyguards.

443
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,473
Protect the money!

444
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,018
Hello?
<i>-</i> Another cell phone addict?

445
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,646
You're all dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

446
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,190
Pathetic! Pathetic!

447
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,526
Now, gentlemen, the rules are simple.

448
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,779
Protect your ﬂag at all costs,

449
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,156
and capture theirs.

450
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,451
And try to work together as a team.

451
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,537
Shoot at anyone with a green armband.

452
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,500
Vanderbeer, you stay in the
bunker and protect the ﬂag.

453
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,378
St. John, Sin, you ﬂank left.

454
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,755
Me and Haussmann will ﬂank right.

455
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,725
All, right.

456
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,521
Let's see what you wealthy
warriors are made of.

457
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,362
What is wrong with you?
You must obey my orders.

458
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,489
Since when is this your command?
- Since now.

459
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,409
I am the one with the most
military experience here.

460
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,285
Son,

461
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,496
just because you peddle a lot of
guns to a bunch of tin-pot dictators,

462
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,374
that don't make you our leader.
<i>-</i> Don't call me "son," old man.

463
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,751
You're not my father.
- How do you know?

464
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,837
I should be in charge!

465
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,464
My last game, War Whore,
sold fifty-million units.

466
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,341
That's five-zero.
<i>-</i> So what?

467
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,760
My great great uncle was a
general in two World Wars.

468
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,888
I should be in command.
<i>-</i> Oh, wow, your uncle was in a war.

469
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,724
That must mean you're
an incredible warrior.

470
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,685
Look, that makes no sense.

471
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,481
Why don't we take off these helmets
and I'll punch you in the throat?

472
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,693
I'm not obeying a virgin.
<i>-</i> Who are you calling a virgin?

473
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,112
You've never killed a man, have you?

474
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,033
That's what men are made
for. Fighting, not fucking.

475
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,328
Maybe I'll shoot you
just to pop my cherry.

476
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,414
You just try it. And I'll
cut your bourgeois throat.

477
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,124
Come on, try it.

478
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,172
Excuse me, ladies.

479
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,257
Hey, where are you going?

480
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,428
I've got nothing to
prove to you pussies.

481
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,138
I signed up for a fight.

482
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,773
Ah! Not my face!

483
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,063
Now, that's what I
call a hostile takeover.

484
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,817
You know the only rule in
life? You've got to win.

485
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,777
We won!

486
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,529
We're dead, but we won!

487
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,841
Come on, come on! Through the tires

488
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,176
Come on! Come on! Move it!

489
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,803
All right.

490
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,767
Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on! Keep moving!

491
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,978
No, no. Right in there.

492
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,566
I know you've got a
bum leg. I don't care!

493
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,776
I don't care. You signed
up for this, didn't you?

494
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,288
Get through there. Hop over it.

495
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,290
There you go.

496
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,462
All right. Good.

497
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,467
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it!

498
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,636
Let's see why they call
you the killer. Let's go!

499
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,680
Cover the money!

500
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,267
Good. Good.

501
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,659
Game over.

502
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,119
Gentlemen,

503
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:40,457
tomorrow we leave for Snake
Island. For your own safety,

504
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,710
all of your personal possessions
are now going to be collected.

505
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,379
Place them in this bag.

506
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,881
Anything you can think of

507
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,550
hat can be used to
positively identify you.

508
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:55,222
Cell phones, documents, wallets.
You're not taking anything with you.

509
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,392
Until our mission is complete
you will have no names.

510
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,480
Come on, move it, Vanderbeer.
Put your cell phone in there.

511
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,320
Now get some shut eye. We
leave at oh-five-hundred.

512
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,269
How long until we take off, Captain?

513
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,021
As soon as we're done
loading the weapons.

514
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,485
All right, guys, let's
keep loading up boxes.

515
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,779
Hurry up! Move it! Move it!

516
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,948
Aw! Come on, kid.

517
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,549
Five minutes to landing.
- Roger that.

518
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,018
We've got a problem, buddy.

519
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,770
I hear you. Where's it coming from?

520
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,105
Okay, take her out. Fire!

521
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,491
Beautiful.

522
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:20,909
Craig, it's getting hot!

523
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,494
What the hell is going on, Captain?

524
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,705
She said this shoreline
was safe. Lying bitch!

525
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,298
Give them a scare. Fire!

526
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,229
Look who we have here.

527
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,438
Again!

528
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,072
Spin the wheel!

529
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,324
I know how we can beat the system.

530
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,742
What are you talking about?

531
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,495
The shells take five seconds to arrive.

532
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,958
The fire-control computer projects
target movement five seconds ahead.

533
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,420
If you zigzag fast enough
you can beat the computer.

534
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,755
All right, Mike. Zigzag.

535
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,091
Zigzag. Head for the coast.

536
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,676
Head for the coast!

537
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,044
Port-side boat. Fire!

538
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,678
Mike!

539
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,638
Mike!

540
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,235
Get down. Get down!

541
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:36,211
Okay, grab whatever gear you can
and take cover in those rocks.

542
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,300
Come on! Come on!

543
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,260
Welcome to Snake Island, gentlemen.

544
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,387
You may never leave.

545
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,681
Come on, come on! Move
it! Move it! Move it!

546
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:51,893
Fire.

547
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,368
God damn!

548
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,662
That'll pucker your rear end.

549
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,874
Any injuries?
- No.

550
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,217
This is Tommy Sin.

551
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,470
Didn't I say no cell phones?

552
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,641
And you, how much are you getting?

553
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,726
What are they paying
you? My friends are dead!

554
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,062
Grimaud Tourneur does
not sell people out.

555
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,647
Well, then how did you
know about that cannon?

556
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,192
I sold it to Colonel
Lupo. He didn't pay me.

557
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,486
That's why I'm on this trip.

558
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,197
To kill him or get paid.

559
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,117
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

560
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,744
Come on. Come on! Move it! Move it!

561
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,329
Cover! Cover!

562
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,510
You! You said the sea
route would be safe.

563
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,430
Because of you, my men are dead.

564
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,234
I knew you were bad news.

565
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,155
Before I met you, I never
lost a man under my command.

566
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,325
What am I supposed to do
with your precious sponsors?

567
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,707
Fulfill your contract.

568
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,627
Lead them to safety.

569
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,802
These men need your skills now, Craig.

570
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,056
Their survival is in your hands

571
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,272
Once we get to the resistance base camp,

572
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,776
Ernesto can arrange
for their evacuation.

573
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,950
Come on.

574
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,515
Let's get the fuck off this island.

575
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,266
Grimaud, give me your cell phone.

576
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,394
But you wanted to kill man-prey.

577
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,562
You haven't completed your mission.

578
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,815
Yeah, that's very clever.
Give me your cell phone.

579
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,483
I don't have one.

580
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,652
Hey, Sam. Do you have a cell phone?

581
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:52,031
Now, son, I know things
aren't going according to plan,

582
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,743
but Sam Haussmann didn't come all
this way just to turn tail and run.

583
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,870
And I'm not sure using a cell phone

584
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,164
is such a swift idea, either.

585
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,792
This isn't what we paid for!

586
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,133
How you holding up, Sam?

587
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,927
Getting old, Captain. Slowing down.

588
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,096
Enjoy it while you can, Captain.

589
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,598
You're a long time gone.

590
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,316
I'm hungry. What have we got to eat?

591
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,943
We eat at the camp.

592
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,655
Just remember, I'm on
a low-carb diet, okay?

593
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,177
It's over.

594
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:57,013
Without those weapons, we
can't resist any longer.

595
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,517
Tomorrow, you'll evacuate our sponsors.

596
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,563
I'll find us a boat. You'll be
paid in full for your services

597
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,077
Definitely not low-carb.

598
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,496
I should have brought my chef.

599
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:25,166
Charlie, why the hell did you
pay to come on this mission?

600
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,585
Just so's you could
whine about everything?

601
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,670
Bragging rights.

602
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:34,133
Such is life on the street. Wall Street.

603
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,762
He who dares, wins.

604
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,267
We already know why Grimaud's here.

605
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,646
He's being shot at
with his own merchandise

606
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,107
and he hasn't been paid for it.

607
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,154
Why are you here, Tommy?

608
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,407
Doctor's orders.

609
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,287
My psychiatrist said that I am
addicted to shooter video games.

610
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,666
She suggested a dose of healthy reality.

611
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,086
So you're here to feel the real?

612
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,466
All right, that takes
care of the logistics.

613
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:20,012
But I'm not leaving this island
until we figure out one thing.

614
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,557
Why my men were killed.

615
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,725
Somebody talked.

616
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,979
If I were you, I would
move this base right now.

617
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,939
How about you, Sam?

618
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:34,277
Well, Sam just wants to hang a
human head in his trophy cabinet.

619
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,446
I don't plan on going home.

620
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,076
My present wife, I just
call her "number five,"

621
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,870
she's suing me for divorce.

622
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:48,624
And according to that prenuptial bullshit
I was an fool in love enough to sign,

623
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,794
if we split, she gets
half of everything I own.

624
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:56,299
Whereas, if I get killed, my
kids inherit the whole she-bang.

625
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,594
Hell, I've already
survived two heart attacks

626
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,847
I've done pretty much everything
there is to do on this old planet.

627
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,141
And I've enjoyed the
hell out of it, too.

628
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,436
No, this here is all there is.

629
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,818
I say we stay here for the
night, break camp in the morning.

630
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,197
Okay, fine, that's your choice.
But I'm taking my men out of here.

631
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,824
At least what's left of them.

632
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,244
Die in battle...

633
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,458
That's a hell of a way
to screw a gold-digger.

634
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,377
And what are your reasons?

635
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,935
Get your things, we're
getting the hell out of here.

636
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,386
Yes!

637
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,596
Oh, we got 'em, we got 'em.

638
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,390
Here, take a look.

639
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:31,519
Ernesto!
<i>-</i> Cecilia, save yourself!

640
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,334
Okay, left ﬂank, move in. Wipe 'em out.

641
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,931
What's up, Captain?

642
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,352
You wanted to see what war
looks like? Take a look.

643
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,919
All right, wait here. Don't
give way your position.

644
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,504
Hey, where you going?

645
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,358
Get the bitch!

646
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,855
Jesus, they're getting
torn to shreds down there.

647
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,262
So this is what our money bought us?

648
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,266
To play war safely, from a distance?

649
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,186
So, we're going to just hide?

650
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,523
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

651
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,777
Let's go kill some bad guys.

652
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:30,239
We start firing, they'll
spot our position.

653
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:36,912
Shoot, you can't bake a cake
without breaking some eggs.

654
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,430
Jackpot!

655
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,516
There's a sniper! There! There!
The enemy sniper, you see him?

656
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,194
The Grim Reaper is next.

657
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:48,317
Come on. Come on.

658
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,703
Incoming!

659
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,275
What the fuck happened?

660
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,485
Which one of you is responsible
for giving away our position?

661
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,738
Seemed to me our friends
down there needed some help.

662
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,004
Where's Vanderbeer?

663
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,298
Last time I saw him he was in the...

664
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,593
Looks like I won that bet.

665
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,970
It's a bet, you'll never call in.

666
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,098
Shit! Come on, come on!
Move it! Move it! Follow me.

667
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:03,809
Come!

668
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,885
Everybody behind the tree. Take cover!

669
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,905
Can they see us?
<i>-</i> Sin, stay down!

670
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,450
Where is that chopper coming from?

671
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:05,162
I said, where is that
chopper coming from?

672
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,414
Cecilia, you've got to snap out of it!

673
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,584
That helicopter's coming from
a helipad that serves the mines

674
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:14,713
It's about three kilometers from here.

675
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:01,427
How do you know about this base?

676
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,973
I used to play in these
woods when I was a boy.

677
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,393
My father served here
during the Cold War.

678
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,187
And what do they mine here? Gold?

679
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,066
Coltan.

680
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,194
It's a rare Earth metal.

681
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,365
And you trade metals, don't you?
- Yes.

682
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,870
You want to tell us
now why you are here?

683
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:31,290
Business with Colonel Lupo.

684
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,792
I need that metal.
- Business?

685
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,463
You bastard.

686
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:41,425
People died because of your business.

687
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,094
We all believed you wanted
to help free this island.

688
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:48,015
Maybe it's you. You who
betrayed us for fucking money.

689
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,939
Your greed has left you
with blood on your hands.

690
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:05,783
Here.

691
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,085
Wait here until I get back.

692
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,392
Cecilia!

693
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,772
It's too exposed up here.

694
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,858
We've got to get back to the group.

695
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:50,994
Look, I'm sorry about your brother.

696
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:53,747
And I'm sorry about your friends.

697
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,000
But there is nothing I
can do to bring them back.

698
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:02,256
Just like there's nothing
I can do to bring back mine.

699
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,059
Boys, this is our chance.

700
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,356
Sam, do you think you
can pilot that thing?

701
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,693
Piece of cake.

702
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,823
Let's wait for Craig.

703
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:30,617
It's a trap. I can smell it.

704
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,620
We capture it. We wait for them there.

705
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,789
You really want to die on this island?

706
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,042
Any moment now, that
chopper could take off again.

707
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,628
What do you say, gentlemen?

708
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:43,964
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

709
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,465
I'm in.

710
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,718
Let's do it.
<i>-</i> Come on.

711
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,305
Let's go.

712
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:11,408
Craig.

713
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,952
See how easy it is to
trap fools like you?

714
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,537
All you need is the right bait.

715
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,957
Take them away!

716
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,010
Those stupid bags of money.

717
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,139
Oh,Jesus Christ

718
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,170
What is this place?

719
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,589
It was a NATO base during the Cold War.

720
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,883
The whole mountain is
tunneled out from the inside.

721
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,177
Nice tomb.

722
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,555
Think we'll ever get out of here alive?

723
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,271
Hello again!

724
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,318
Your accommodation awaits.

725
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,117
Nice here, huh?

726
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,077
Private pool.

727
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,455
Room service

728
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,416
Concierge.

729
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,088
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

730
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,299
Thank God, you're here!

731
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,218
Charlie!

732
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,058
Hey, Tommy.

733
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,269
I don't believe it.

734
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,106
Hey, Sam. Hey, buddy.

735
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,816
Well, we thought you were dead.

736
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,486
Me? Dead?

737
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,446
Of course not.

738
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,409
So what happened to you?

739
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,286
Well, I don't know about you guys,

740
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,997
but I have never been so
scared in my whole life.

741
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,418
I go outside to take a piss

742
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:14,591
and then all the shells started dropping
and the sound and the noise and the smoke.

743
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,635
I got completely disoriented.

744
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,846
I did not know where the fuck I was.

745
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:24,601
So I eventually found my way back and
the tent was destroyed you guys had gone,

746
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,603
and soldiers came and...

747
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,688
Now here I am.

748
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:32,442
Does anyone have a cell phone?
- No.

749
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,985
Just hoping.

750
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:38,448
Hey, Charlie. Have you got any of
those fancy cigars of yours left?

751
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,493
Sure, Sam.

752
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,914
Hey, Tommy, what happened
to our Captain and that girl?

753
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:49,167
Oh, he is...
<i>-</i> They are dead.

754
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,590
Yeah. Dead.

755
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,300
Yeah.

756
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,719
Do you mind if I have one of those?

757
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:00,929
Of course not.
- Thanks.

758
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,140
Only fifty bucks a smoke.

759
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,438
So, uh, how did they get killed?

760
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:11,648
Tank shell.

761
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,901
Kapowl Boom! Awful.

762
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,738
I think I've still got some of
the Captain in my hair, Charlie.

763
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,171
Well, some trip this
turned out to be, huh?

764
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,134
What are you looking at?

765
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,610
Open up!

766
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,069
Open up!

767
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,488
You fucking piece of piss.

768
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:02,616
You sold us out!

769
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,120
Yeah, well. Big deal.

770
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,081
Get over it.

771
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,667
I'm going to kick your ass.

772
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,435
Eat shit and die, old man.

773
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,896
Fucking hell. Okay.

774
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,859
You can inform Colonel Lupe

775
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,363
that Captain McCenzie
and the girl are dead.

776
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,365
Satisfied?

777
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,956
Ooh, the wild bunch.

778
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,668
So, you see, gentlemen,

779
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:58,338
we do know who you really are.

780
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:03,760
Mr. Sin.

781
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:08,556
I always wanted to be a nemesis
character in one of your video games.

782
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:13,687
Why would anyone want to play
a tin-pot criminal like you

783
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:16,231
in one of my video games?

784
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,694
Because he can get to do shit like this.

785
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:25,448
That's why!

786
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,744
He shot me in the leg!

787
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,962
We can stay dry under here.

788
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,011
Think there are any snakes in here?

789
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,221
No.Just me.

790
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:53,435
I'm sorry for this
challenging assignment.

791
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,769
I'm all in.

792
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,105
Now we get to save the others.
- What do you mean?

793
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,774
Well, what did you think I was
gonna do, leave them all here to die?

794
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,826
Come on, Sam!
<i>-</i> Yeah.

795
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,244
Breathe hard, Sam.

796
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,579
Breathe hard. That's it.

797
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:15,957
Well, you wanted to
feel the real game, boy.

798
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,917
Now you know.

799
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:19,794
It hurts.

800
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:24,007
How does it look? Am I going to die?

801
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,259
Yes.
<i>-</i> What?

802
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:30,847
Someday. But not from
this little scratch.

803
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,935
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Hold him down.

804
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,854
I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm all right.

805
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:40,607
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

806
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:44,736
1899. I saved the best for last.

807
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,488
It's a goddamn shame

808
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:49,324
to waste good cognac on a ﬂesh wound.

809
01:12:52,077 --> 01:12:53,912
Here you go, son.

810
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,247
Have a little hair of the goat.

811
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,470
Is it finished?
- Yes, yes.

812
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,180
Is it over?
- Yeah.

813
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,766
You should put that around your neck.

814
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,374
Go!

815
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,342
Good morning, gentlemen.

816
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,469
We're looking well this morning.

817
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,305
Come on, come on, line 'em
up. We've got business.

818
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,745
Good morning, gentlemen.

819
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:21,291
I trust you've got no illusions
as to why you're still alive.

820
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,627
Half of your net worth.

821
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,505
That's my price for
letting each of you go.

822
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,467
Once we agree,

823
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:35,555
my new financial consultant
will work out the details.

824
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,519
And if we don't agree?

825
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,356
Then where you are going,

826
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:48,526
you don't get to take anything with you.

827
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:55,867
The Grim Reaper always
gets paid. You owe me.

828
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,413
And what about you, old man?

829
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:04,000
Old enough to know
bullshit when I step in it.

830
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,177
Would you rather lose
your lives than your money?

831
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:19,724
Are you rich bastards
really that tight-fisted?

832
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,526
That's your choice.

833
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,449
Kill this liar first.

834
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,411
And what about me?

835
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,748
I might want to buy an extra life.

836
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,041
Tommy!

837
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,461
We're not in a fucking video
game. This man will kill us.

838
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:55,802
Mr. Vanderbeer, how much do
you calculate Mr. Sin is worth?

839
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:04,644
My daughter.

840
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,731
Next time, I'll kill you.

841
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,692
Hey, Lupo!

842
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,239
Hold your fire!

843
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:19,993
If you want your daughter
back, you'll let these men go.

844
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,375
Release the prisoners!

845
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:41,889
Go!

846
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:47,103
Don't shoot!

847
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,404
Secure the base!

848
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,698
I want those bastards killed!

849
01:16:58,823 --> 01:16:59,907
Come on!

850
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,493
Come here, my darling.
- You heard him. Go!

851
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,053
Craig!

852
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,139
Cecilia! You go!
We'll find another way.

853
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,558
Get the hell out of here!

854
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,608
That bitch tried to kill me!
- Magda, stop!

855
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,610
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
- After her!

856
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:36,861
Follow me!

857
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:45,036
All right, come on. We are
going this way. Go! Go!

858
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,751
Hey! Where did they
go? Where did they go?

859
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,836
On the right, guys!
On the right! Come on!

860
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,130
Take this boat back to Colonel Lupo.

861
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,550
There is no one here. Raise the boom!

862
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,869
You lose.

863
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,663
Hey, Captain.

864
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,135
This is my merchandise.

865
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:44,387
Help yourselves.

866
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,996
Shit! We've got to get
the hell out of here!

867
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,749
If a bullet hits one of those
barrels, we're all dead.

868
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,042
Give me a push.

869
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:18,004
What are you gonna do?

870
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:20,673
No worries, I'm only
going along for the ride.

871
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,344
Push, god damn it!

872
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,268
Push! Come on!

873
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,279
Stay down! Stay down!

874
01:20:01,756 --> 01:20:04,175
You find those guys or I
get the fuck off this island.

875
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:05,968
There they are!

876
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,310
Cover me!

877
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,980
Take him outwith grenades. Okay?
- No!

878
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,065
What do you mean, "no"?
<i>-</i> There are barrels of explosives.

879
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,609
If they ignite, this
whole place will blow up.

880
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,946
Okay, look. You take care of that old
man. I'll see you're well paid for it.

881
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,544
I'll be back.

882
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,720
Where is everyone going?

883
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:39,979
Shoot!

884
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,272
Shoot him!

885
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,626
Remember me?

886
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,671
I told you I'd kill you.

887
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,059
Hey, Tommy.

888
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,686
Looking for somebody?

889
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,172
Before you kill me, Charlie,

890
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,593
just answer me one thing.
- Yeah.

891
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,887
Why did you do it?

892
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,349
Nothing personal, Tommy.

893
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,685
I had no choice.

894
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:04,647
You see, I knew my hedge
fund was going to crash.

895
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,400
I didn't want to spend the
rest of my life in jail,

896
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:10,277
so I transferred the
rest of my funds here.

897
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,156
I thought this would make
quite a nice a retirement home.

898
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:16,909
My mistake.

899
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,204
My fucking leg!

900
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,749
Stop messing around, you little junkie.

901
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,169
Charlie! Don't do it.

902
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,134
Video boy! Do it!

903
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,779
Fucking banker!

904
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:04,832
I hope you guys are long gone.

905
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,217
Bye, bye, number five.

906
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:06,060
Nice! Nice work, frog's legs.

907
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,488
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

908
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,553
Breathe! Come on.

909
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,760
Nice work.

910
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:58,232
A toast. To Sam Haussmann!
