1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,670
Winter Wonderland
冬季仙境

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,940
Mairead - Violinist

3
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,120
Meav - Vocalist

00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,070
Lisa - Vocalist

00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,470
Susan - Vocalist

6
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,340
Celtic Woman

7
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,320
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,210
In the lane, snow is glistening

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,110
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,970
Walking in a winter wonderland

11
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,570
Gone away is the bluebird

12
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,210
Here to stay is a new bird

13
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,310
He sings a love song, as we go along

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,710
Walking in a winter wonderland

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,810
In the meadow we can build a snowman

16
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,420
And pretend that he is Parson Brown

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,290
He'll say: Are you married? We'll say: No man,

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,670
But you can do the job when you're in town

19
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,780
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,360
To face unafraid the plans that we've made

21
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,700
Walking in a winter wonderland

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
In the meadow we can build a snowman

23
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,930
And pretend that he's a circus clown

24
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,310
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,

25
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Until the other kids knock him down

26
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,320
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening

27
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,150
In the lane, snow is glistening

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,250
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

29
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:13,720
Walking in a winter wonderland

30
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,340
What Child Is This
孰为此儿

31
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:40,200
What child is this,
who laid to rest on Mary’s lap is sleeping

32
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,410
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet

33
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,170
While shepherds watch are keeping

34
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:03,770
Raise, raise the song on high
His mother sings her lullaby

35
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,650
Joy, joy for Christ is born

36
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:16,070
The Babe, the Son of Mary

37
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,060
This, this is Christ the King

38
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,810
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

39
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,270
Haste, haste to bring Him praise

40
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:42,100
The babe, the son of Mary

41
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,510
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh

42
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,690
Come, peasant, king, to own Him!

43
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,730
The King of Kings salvation brings

44
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,810
Let loving hearts enthrone Him!

45
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,870
This, this is Christ the King

46
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,060
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

47
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,130
Haste, haste to bring Him praise

48
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:35,030
The babe, the son of Mary

49
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,460
This, this is Christ the King

50
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,980
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

51
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,690
Haste, haste to bring Him praise

52
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,528
The babe, the son of Mary

53
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,120
This, this is Christ the King

54
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,380
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

55
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,250
Haste, haste to bring Him praise

56
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:52,230
The babe, the son of Mary

57
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:09,440
The babe, the son of Mary

58
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,050
Thank you so much, thank you

59
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,260
I can't tell you how obviously delighted
we are to be back here in the Helix

60
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,160
This is where all started for Celtic Woman

61
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,890
So it's like our spiritual home

62
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,700
Delighted you could be here with us

63
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,450
So many of you that travelled,

64
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,470
and for the home crowd as well

65
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
Very nice to see you here tonight

66
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,590
And we are having a ball
so please feel free to join in

67
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,300
You definitely know the next song,

68
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,600
even my four year old daughter knows it

69
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,970
and she's been singing it in the car
with me when I have been practising

70
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,430
And it is
"We wish you a merry Christmas"

71
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,570
We Wish You a Merry Christmas
祝你圣诞快乐

72
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:08,280
Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin

73
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:17,600
Good tidings for Christmas
and a Happy New Year

74
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,940
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas

75
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,050
We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year

76
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,420
Oh so bring us a pudding

77
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,580
bring us a pudding

78
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,850
bring us a pudding

79
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,590
and a cup of good cheer

80
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,410
We won't go until we get some

81
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,560
won't go until we get some

82
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,750
We won't go until we get some

83
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,750
so bring some out here

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,670
We wish you a Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas

89
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,050
Good tidings we bring

90
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,730
to you and your kin

91
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,410
Good tidings for Christmas

92
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:21,060

I'll Be Home For Christmas
圣诞回乡

103
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,100
I am dreaming tonight

104
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,830
of a place I love

105
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,990
Even more than I usually do

106
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,650
And although I know

107
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,110
it's a long road back

108
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:27,970
I promise you

109
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,570
I'll be home for Christmas

110
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,990
You can count on me

111
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,440
Please have snow and mistletoe

112
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,390
And presents by the tree

113
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,160
Christmas Eve will find me

114
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,190
Where the love light gleams

115
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:17,440
I'll be home for Christmas

116
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:30,280
If only in my dreams

117
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,090
I'll be home for Christmas

118
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,970
You can count on me

119
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,540
Please have snow and mistletoe

120
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,880
and presents by the tree

121
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,750
Christmas Eve will find me

122
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,260
Where the love light gleams

123
00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:00,420
I'll be home for Christmas

124
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:24,670
If only in my dreams,
if only in my dreams

125
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,700

00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,510
Peace on earth and mercy mild

129
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:25,360
God and sinners reconciled

130
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,050
Joyful, all ye nations rise

131
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,680
Join the triumph of the skies

132
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,290
With the angelic host proclaim:

133
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,330

Christ by highest heaven adored

137
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,620
Christ the everlasting Lord!

138
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,640
Late in time behold Him come

139
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,410
Offspring of a Virgin's womb

140
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,500
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see

141
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,360
Hail the incarnate Deity

142
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,790
Pleased as man with man to dwell

143
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,010
Jesus, our Emmanuel

144
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,990
Hark! The herald angels sing

145
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,010
"Glory to the newborn King!"

146
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,930
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!

147
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,610
Hail the Son of Righteousness!

148
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Light and life to all He brings

149
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,180
Risen with healing in His wings

150
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,570
Mild He lays His glory by

151
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,710
Born that man no more may die

152
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,680
Born to raise the sons of earth

153
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,880
Born to give them second birth

154

Hark! The herald angels sing

155

You better not cry

All is calm, all is bright

263

Round yon virgin , mother and child

Silent night, Holy night

268
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:06,630
Shepherds quake at the sight

269
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,680
Glories stream from heaven afar

270
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:23,020
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!

271

Silent night, Holy night

Son of God, love's pure light

276
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:25,400
Radiant beams from Thy holy face

277
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:33,790
With the dawn of redeeming grace

278

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

279

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

280

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

281
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,920
It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas
圣诞将至

282
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:39,140
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

283
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,700
Everywhere you go

284
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,020
Take a look in the Five and Ten

285
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,350
Glistening once again

286
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,830
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

287
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:09,060
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

288
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,660
Toys in every store

289
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,740
But the prettiest sight to see

290
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:30,350
Is the holly that will be on your own front door

291
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,400
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots

292
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,530
Is the wish of Barney and Ben

293
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,150
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk

294
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,210
Is the hope of Janice and Jen

295
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,330
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait

296
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,570
for school to start again

297
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,840
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

298
00:40:54,850 --> 00:41:00,390
Soon the bells will start

299
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:06,650
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

300
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,510
Soon the bells will start

301
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,070
And the thing that will make them ring

302
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:20,060
Is the Carol that you sing right within your heart

303
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:25,430
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

304
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,860
Everywhere you go

305
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,450
But the prettiest sight to see

306
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,800
Is the holly that will be

307
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:46,510
on your own front door

308
00:41:48,200 --> 00:42:01,210
So it's Christmas once more

309
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,340
The Light of Christmas Morn
圣诞节之光

310
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,860
The winds of chill December sound

311
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,890
The farewell of the year

312
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,460
And evening shadows gather round

313
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,470
And cloud the soul with fear

314
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,160
But rest you well good Christian men

315
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,140
Nor be of heart forlorn

316
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,660
December's darkness brings again

317
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,210
The light of Christmas morn

318
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,350
The welcome snow each Christmastide

319
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,410
Falls shining from the skies

320
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,050
On village paths and uplands wide

321
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,280
All holy white, it lies

322
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,960
It crowns with pearl, the oaks and pines

323
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,270
And glitters on the thorn

324
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,680
But purer still the light that shines

325
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,680
On gladsome Christmas morn

326
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,070
The shepherds poor, how blest were they

327
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,960
The angel song to hear

328
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,660
In manger cradle, as he lay

329
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,750
To greet the Saviour dear

330
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,100
The Lord of heaven's eternal height

331
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,950
For us a babe was born

332
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,910
And He, the very light of light

333
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,680
Shone forth that Christmas morn

334
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,820
The chapel lights above the snow

335
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,150
Do warm the coldest chill

336
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,450
And manger scene, by candle glow

337
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,990
Inclines us to goodwill

338
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,440
Ablaze in wonder and in awe

339
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,490
As every heart adores

340
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,220
But brighter still, the light that falls

341
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,010
On gladsome Christmas morn

342
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,580
December's darkness brings again

343
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:09,370
The light of Christmas morn

344
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,660
It Came Upon A Midnight Clear
星夜颂赞

345
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:47,240
It came upon a midnight clear

346
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,710
That glorious song of old

347
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,210
From angels bending near the earth

348
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:07,070
To touch their harps of gold

349
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:13,900
Still through the cloven skies they come

350
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,360
With peaceful wings unfurled

351
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:26,630
And still the heavenly music floats

352
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:33,200
O'er all the weary world

353
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,740
Peace on the earth

354
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,610
Good will to men

355
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:46,050
From heaven's all gracious King

356
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:52,790
The world in solemn stillness lay

357
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,740
To hear the angels sing

358
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:08,870
It came upon a midnight clear

359
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:14,580
That glorious song of old

360
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:20,860
From angels bending near the earth

361
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:29,420
To touch their harps of gold

362
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:41,090
[hear the angels sing]

363
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:54,810
It came that glorious song of old

364
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:00,670
From angels bending near the earth

365
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,770
To touch their harps of gold

366
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,020
Peace on the earth

367
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,920
Good will to men

368
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:22,880
From heaven's all gracious King

369
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:31,110
The world in solemn stillness lay

370
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:42,320
To hear the angels sing

371
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,150
Peace on the earth

372
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,520
Good will to men

373
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,250
Good will to men

374
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,920
Peace on the earth

375
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:12,790
Peace on the earth

376
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,320
Ladies and gentlemen, the Discovery Gospel Choir!

377
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,030
Good evening everybody

378
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,870
Are you having fun?

379
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,230
Good

380
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,820
We are obviously thrilled that
you are all here with us to celebrate Christmas scent

381
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,820
What a night spin and thank you all
so much for such a beautiful warm welcome

382
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,120
And it is so lovely to see so many beautiful kids

383
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:54,310
eagerly awaiting Santa Claus here with us tonight

384
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,440
Thank you all for being here with us it's fantastic

385
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,840
I want to take you all across the sea to Scottland

386
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,080
This is one of the very oldest traditional songs

387
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,650
That's sung around this time of the year

388
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,440
And this song, it's by saying

389
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,070
Farewell to one year

390
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,510
And welcoming in the new

391
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,380
This is,
Auld Lang Syne

392
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,890
Auld Lang Syne
友谊地久天长

393
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:28,800
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

394
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:33,670
and never brought to mind?

395
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:39,570
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

396
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,330
for auld lang syne?

397
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:50,940
For auld lang syne, my jo

398
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,500
For auld lang syne

399
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:01,150
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

400
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:08,790
for auld lang syne

401
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,910
We two have run about the braes

402
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,710
and pu'd the gowans fine

403
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,930
And we've wandered many a weary stop

404
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:32,100
since auld lang syne

405
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:37,090
For auld lang syne, my jo

406
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,750
For auld lang syne

407
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:48,040
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

408
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,160
for auld lang syne

409
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:01,960
We two have paddled in the burn

410
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:06,360
from morning sun till dine

411
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,300
But seas between us broad have roared

412
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:17,700
since auld lang syne

413
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,730
For auld lang syne, my jo

414
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,540
For auld lang syne

415
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:34,450
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

416
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:49,240
for auld lang syne

417
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,920
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much

418
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,240
You have been such a fantastic audience

419
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,470
Good night, and merry Christmas!

420
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,450
Joy To The World
普世欢腾

421
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,800
Joy to the world! The Lord is come

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns

428
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:15,950
Let men their songs employ

429
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,720
While fields and floods,
rocks, hills and plains

430
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,010
Repeat the sounding joy,
repeat the sounding joy

431
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:33,070
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy!

432
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,240
He rules the world,

433
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,790
with truth and grace

434
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:50,530
And makes the nations prove

435
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:56,190
The glories of His righteousness

436
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,920
And wonders of His love

437
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,710
And wonders of His love

438
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:08,210
And wonders and wonders of His love

439
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,880
Joy to the world! The Lord is come

440

Let every heart prepare Him room

442
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,340
And heaven and nature sing
