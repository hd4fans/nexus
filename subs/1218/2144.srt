1
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,438
Attention!

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:24,157
DEVILS ON THE DOORSTEP

3
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,631
Left!

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,235
Forward!

5
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,451
Little Thresher!

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,460
Er Bozi!

7
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,261
Er Bozi!

8
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,034
Sensei!

9
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,199
Have you all been good?

10
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,106
Have some candy.

11
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,281
Good boys!

12
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,048
Watch this.

13
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,223
Which hand?

14
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,793
Smart kid. Try again.

15
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,486
Which hand?

16
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,153
No.

17
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,358
This one!

18
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,837
Clean water, no dirty water.

19
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,530
One, two, three.

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,437
Or I'll knock your block off.
Understand?

21
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,238
Yes. You'll have clean water tonight.

22
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,196
1945, NORTH CHINA
THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION

23
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,026
- Let me look at you.
- What for?

24
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,433
Please, let me look!

25
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,832
At what? No!

26
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,162
Come on!

27
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,297
Be quick

28
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,874
Don't stop!

29
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,383
- Who's there?
- Me

30
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,716
- Who?
- Me

31
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,291
- Hurry!
- What'll you do?

32
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,859
The usual

33
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,866
- Who is it?
- Me

34
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,875
Close your eyes

35
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,041
Name

36
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,617
Dasan Ma

37
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,786
What's this village called?

38
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,479
Rack-Armor Terrace

39
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,354
What are you doing up so late?

40
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,948
Thinking

41
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,694
Well, think away

42
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,632
Listen to me

43
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,030
I'm leaving two things with you

44
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,198
I want them both back. Both

45
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,799
Don't let the Jap devils find out

46
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,002
Any slipup

47
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,945
and you're a dead man

48
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,646
But they've got a blockhouse here

49
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,240
It could be hard

50
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,446
It'll be all right

51
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,756
“The darkest place
is under the candlestick.”

52
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,461
- Understand?
- Yes

53
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,794
If there's trouble,
who's responsible?

54
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,395
You

55
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,090
Who was it?

56
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,664
Don't know

57
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,972
It's alive!

58
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,838
I'll tell that guy!

59
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,216
Dasan Ma!

60
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,586
Listen. In your spare time,
interrogate them

61
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,360
We'll collect them on
New Year's Eve

62
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,692
together with their statements

63
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,666
Understand?

64
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,361
Yes

65
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,734
Who'll collect them?

66
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,136
Me!

67
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,066
It was like this

68
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,546
Just like this!

69
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
Then he jumped the wall and ran off

70
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,077
So what was his name?

71
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,022
Didn't say.
called himself “me.”

72
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,957
So, what'd he look like?

73
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,823
Don't know. My eyes were closed

74
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,295
How about his clothes?
Was he tall?

75
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,366
With your eyes closed,
can you see me?

76
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,399
How many were there?

77
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,160
I didn't dare open my eyes!

78
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,239
So what exactly did he say?

79
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,366
He said he'd leave ‘em here
till New Year's Eve

80
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,570
when he'd come for ‘em

81
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,442
He sounded really fierce

82
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,016
He said, “The darkest place
is under the candlestick.”

83
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,683
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!

84
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,914
You can talk family business later

85
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,719
Dasan's been with your son's widow
for some time

86
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,555
We have to talk

87
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,892
With these good-for-nothings?

88
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,089
Go to bed!

89
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,666
Dad, have some water

90
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,203
Don't call me dad.
Shameless slut

91
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,295
A father-in-law
can't talk this way

92
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,876
Go for me, then!
I'm fed up with you!

93
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,877
- I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
- cut it out!

94
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,823
Good fortune is having no troubles,
but misfortune can't be avoided

95
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,897
Well, is it fortune or misfortune?
What should we do?

96
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,168
Take ‘em to the blockhouse.
I'm in with their chief

97
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,069
- What?
- Hand ‘em over

98
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,270
That's no good. What'll I say?
when that guy comes back for ‘em?

99
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,313
Tell him to see the Japs.
What would he dare do?

100
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,211
You kidding?

101
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,683
This guy ties up Japs in sacks!
What wouldn't he dare do?

102
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,016
- What are you? A collaborator?
- Seems like it!

103
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,592
I'll throttle one with each hand
and then we'll bury ‘em!

104
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,033
That's it!

105
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,829
We'll just dig a hole.
I'll do that

106
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,803
You would? But that guy said

107
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,899
if anything happens to ‘em
or if the Japs find out

108
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,477
we'd be killed!

109
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,205
- Killed?
- Who'd be killed?

110
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,305
He said he'd kill everyone
in the village

111
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,213
Nothing

112
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,983
- What?
- What?

113
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,114
Forget it

114
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,192
Speak

115
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,620
I thought we could run away

116
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,027
and leave the sacks here.
What could he do to us?

117
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,565
Sit down!

118
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,827
You made me say it

119
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,797
If we all have to die anyway,
why don't I just kill you?

120
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,468
Stop it! If you don't, I'm going

121
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:39,736
come back

122
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,985
Sit down

123
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,454
It's unheard of.
He's threatening us all?

124
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:56,260
I'll throttle ‘em, and we'll bury ‘em

125
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,059
Bury ‘em

126
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,033
No good will come from this

127
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,165
Such deeds are not
the work of idle men

128
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,636
Provoke neither those
who dwell in the hills

129
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,337
nor those who come from the sea

130
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:21,520
New Year's Eve is five days away.
On that day they'll come

131
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,488
Steal away with them

132
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,253
and disaster will be averted

133
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,662
San

134
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,895
For the sake of the village,
act with care these next few days

135
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,801
- Er Bozi.
- Yes, Old Uncle?

136
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,170
Don't tell your mother about this

137
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,266
She's got a big mouth

138
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,404
I'll keep it to myself, all right?

139
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,948
All right. We can go home

140
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,145
Wait!

141
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,153
There's something else

142
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,953
That guy said
we should interrogate them

143
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,829
Interrogate them?

144
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,491
About what?

145
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,517
Sensei!

146
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,650
Have some candy

147
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,123
Boy good!

148
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,960
Have another

149
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,730
Er Bozi, come here!

150
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,361
coming. Sensei

151
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,133
Late no good

152
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,935
If you're late once more

153
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,835
one, two, three

154
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,140
I'll knock your block off!
Understand?

155
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,038
Now, go away!

156
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,001
ORAL STATEM ENT

157
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,739
Name?

158
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,534
Speak

159
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,916
Go on

160
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,928
Name?

161
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,657
Speak

162
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,438
Don't kill us

163
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,875
DON'T KI LL US

164
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,612
- First tell me your name.
- Hanchen Dong

165
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,554
- Age?
- 2 8

166
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,421
- Occupation?
- Translation official

167
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,757
What sort of official is that?

168
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,196
I turn Japanese into Chinese
and Chinese into Japanese

169
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,432
So… what's his name?

170
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,869
Kosaburo Hanaya

171
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,606
Have him tell us himself

172
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,082
Shoot me. Kill me.

173
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,660
If you've got the guts. Cowards

174
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,496
How come his name's so long?

175
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,565
Come on,
we don't want to be killed

176
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,430
We don't understand.
Turn it into Chinese

177
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,163
H is name's Kosaburo Hanaya.
He's 2 5

178
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:04,333
Has he killed Chinese men?
Violated Chinese women?

179
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,571
Have you killed Chinese men?
Raped Chinese women?

180
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,138
Of course.
That's what I came to China for!

181
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,750
He's new to china.
Hasn't seen any women yet

182
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,290
He's killed no one. He's a cook

183
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,792
What's all this talk?
They kill me now or I'll kill them.

184
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,385
Why are you doing this?

185
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,830
I want to anger these cowards.
I won't cooperate with swine!

186
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,937
Will you two stop chattering?
Speak slower

187
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,006
Wait for the questions

188
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,699
He begs you not to kill him

189
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,749
What else?

190
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,282
could you ask him
who was that me,, person?

191
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,989
Who was me,,?

192
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,731
Listen

193
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,495
I want you to tell me who is "me"?

194
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,334
You?

195
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,968
Now I'm stumped

196
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,199
How would I know who you are?

197
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,076
Not me.
The me,, who nabbed you

198
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,640
Just tell us who brought you here

199
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,320
If we knew,
we wouldn't have let him get us

200
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,216
You mean you don't know either?

201
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,316
Where are we anyway?

202
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,987
Who's interrogating whom.
Stick to the questions

203
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,721
Just do it

204
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,892
He begs you not to kill him

205
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,661
Don't be afraid. Listen

206
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,365
I'll read it back to you

207
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,736
Don't kill us

208
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,707
Hanchen Dong. Chinese

209
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,442
2 8. Translation official

210
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,949
Don't know

211
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,317
Kosaburo Hanaya. 2 5

212
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,889
Japanese

213
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,084
Just arrived in china.
Hasn't killed anyone

214
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,060
cook. Don't kill me.,

215
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,830
Is that correct?

216
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,497
Is it?

217
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,232
More or less

218
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,971
Well then do what must be done

219
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,302
Hold on!
I've got more to say!

220
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,466
Kill me!
I'm not afraid to die!

221
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,066
It's a small unit!
There are five machine guns!

222
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,976
You can kill us, but never insult us!

223
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,878
They have nine telephones,
two radio sets --

224
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,076
I'll never surrender!
Or betray the motherland!

225
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,652
An ammunition depot!

226
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,812
We'll be victorious!
Long live the emperor!

227
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,152
- And 1 4 horses!
- Shoot me!

228
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,588
That's it!

229
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,568
Good. I'm old enough
to be your grandfather

230
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,008
To me, you're still kids

231
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,808
This business,
we were asked to do it

232
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,806
Give us your fingerprint.
We'll transfer you

233
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,347
Old Uncle. He's wounded

234
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,151
It's bleeding

235
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,656
Escape

236
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,622
We've got to escape

237
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,854
We've got to

238
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,428
No matter what it involves

239
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,528
Fool. There's no escape.
Better to die now

240
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,268
These peasants won't allow it

241
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,604
It's the guys who captured us

242
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,213
who'll decide our fate

243
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,444
Idiot. I want to die

244
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,218
You don't get it, do you?
Pig-brain

245
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,120
Bastard. What'd you say?

246
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,220
I said, “You're a clever man. ”

247
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,236
Bastard

248
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,832
- Sensei.
- Have some candy

249
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,062
We're in here!
Hurry! Help us!

250
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,432
San, what'll we do?

251
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,903
Help!

252
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,667
Shut him up!

253
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,202
Stop shouting!

254
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,642
Bastards!

255
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,840
- San!
- Help!

256
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,849
- Yell, Dong, damn it!
- Hel p!

257
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,546
Don't smother him

258
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,781
- Use Japanese!
- Hel p!

259
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,415
- Help!
- Try and shout now

260
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,455
San, what'll we do?

261
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,028
Help!

262
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,858
San!

263
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,032
San!

264
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,607
Er Bozi!

265
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,971
Er Bozi!

266
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,110
San, are you crazy?

267
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,884
Get down!

268
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,421
Get down!

269
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,249
- What are you doing? Get down.
- Move

270
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,730
Help! We're in here!
Quick! Help us!

271
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,866
- Go on, shout.
- Hurry! Help!

272
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,911
What's wrong? Shout

273
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,314
I'll help

274
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,852
Save us!
Save us! Help!

275
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,487
A gunboat is passing by

276
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,859
You think they can hear you?

277
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,225
I tried out front,
and they couldn't hear

278
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,330
How noisy is that

279
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,836
It passes here every day.
Shout your head off if you like

280
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,495
It seems it passes here everyday

281
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,038
What were you thinking?

282
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,005
We'll try again next time

283
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,302
Forget it

284
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,004
Between the noise of the boat

285
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,310
and the band, they'll never hear us.

286
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,749
All right, enough talk. Eat

287
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,578
Nothing beats a good meal

288
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,587
But we'd better change
your bandage first

289
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,218
I'll change your bandage

290
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,924
- I'll change your --
- Move over

291
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,523
It's for your own good, you idiot

292
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,104
Dong, tell this woman

293
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,637
she may touch me now,
but I'll touch her later

294
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,936
- More than once or twice.
- What did he say?

295
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,607
-And more than just touch.
-Just ignore him

296
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,511
Hanaya, she's helping you

297
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,913
Don't you have a conscience?

298
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,457
It's the Chinese
who've got no conscience

299
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,255
- First they shoot, then they help.
- Stop talking

300
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,423
Mongrels can't even shoot straight

301
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,898
If they could, you'd be dead

302
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,334
I'll kill myself now

303
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,768
San!

304
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,076
What the hell is going on?

305
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,474
What now? You faking it?

306
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,953
You want to kill yourself?
Use a sharp stone, not wood

307
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,113
You stupid fucker

308
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,555
- Sister-in-law, ignore him.
- I'm not your sister-in-law

309
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,751
Shut up and eat

310
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,290
Thank you, brother.
Brother, do me a favor

311
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,127
Let me go.
We're both Chinese, after all

312
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,461
Will you shut up?

313
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,125
- Hurry.
- I am

314
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:48,070
I was captured once before.
captain Eight let me go

315
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:52,769
Don't give me that.
I have nothing to do with this

316
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,402
We'll be pals
if you do me a favor

317
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,037
Of course. Name it

318
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,879
come as you are,
leave as you are

319
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,453
Don't make trouble.
And don't die on me

320
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,014
All right?

321
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,252
I'm treating you well enough.
Why are you so thoughtless?

322
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,394
He's coming to

323
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,561
I'll tell you one thing.
If you keep this up

324
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,700
I could get nasty

325
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,128
- Who's there?
- It's me

326
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,992
Wake up. It's dawn

327
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,527
Was it cold last night?

328
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,101
It wasn't warm

329
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,730
- What's happening in there?
- Quiet so far

330
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,809
If they don't settle down,
they'll be the death of me

331
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,499
Have a look

332
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,123
Brother. I'm so hot.
can't you take this off me?

333
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,752
I won't kill myself, I promise

334
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,658
Better hot than dead.
Show some thanks, will you?

335
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,703
I'd be damn pleased if someone fed me
and wiped my ass every day

336
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,500
But why suffer like this, brother?

337
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,066
I heard you coughing all night

338
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,769
You were freezing

339
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,609
Let's make this simple. Release us

340
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,584
I'm not putting your life in danger.
So don't put mine in danger

341
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,256
All right? If I let you go,
I'm a dead man

342
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,356
Why aren't you eating?
You've got to eat something

343
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,726
Why isn't he eating? Move over

344
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,727
You

345
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,203
Lighten up

346
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,398
You can't live without eating.
You're human

347
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,032
come on, have some.
Eat

348
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,709
That's good

349
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,881
What the hell?

350
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,044
Bastard!
Humiliating an Imperial Army soldier!

351
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,679
I'll kill you! Chinese pig!

352
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,754
- What's he want?
- White flour

353
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,727
White flour?
Where am I gonna get that?

354
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,598
I wouldn't mind some myself.
Just eat

355
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,794
Don't try to act like
a captain-san here

356
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,200
If he doesn't eat, he'll starve

357
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,839
Starve?

358
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,570
Don't eat, then. But this is it

359
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,103
Let's go

360
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,881
I sent them to get flour--

361
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,385
Bastard! I'm not eating,
And neither are you!

362
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,422
They'll never find flour

363
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:55,120
Without it,
you can go on a hunger strike

364
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,923
They're scared we'll die

365
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,862
They'll let us go

366
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,627
We'll be saved

367
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,236
Fool

368
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:10,104
What? Flour?
Do I look like I'm made of flour?

369
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,234
- Eat me, why don't you?
- Now that's silly

370
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,145
Isn't it a capital crime
to hoard that stuff?

371
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,080
Trying to send me to the gallows?

372
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,981
Auntie. This is a matter of decency

373
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,555
Decency?

374
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,992
You've a mistress in your bed
and  Japs in your cellar

375
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,926
You've got some nerve
talking about decency

376
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,257
Son of a bitch

377
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,561
- You swearing at me?
- No, not you. Er Bozi

378
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:39,603
I'm his mother.
curses at him travel straight to me

379
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,673
You don't understand.
He swears at me too

380
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,335
He hasn't kept his word.
He said he wouldn't tell you

381
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,911
If he lied to me

382
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,414
he wouldn't be my son.
He'd be yours

383
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,147
Whatever you say

384
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,019
But I really need your help

385
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,450
Auntie.
You're fond of me, aren't you?

386
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,663
I've done so much for these two men --
for the sake of the village

387
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,701
I've slept with my clothes on.
I've spent nights in the cellar

388
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,737
I've used all my bedding

389
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:19,639
to pad the walls and floors.
I've wrapped those men in my blankets

390
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,041
That's your fault

391
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,276
I had no choice.
The Jap's threatening suicide

392
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,374
He won't eat

393
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,454
unless his food's made of white flour.
Otherwise, he'll starve himself

394
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,022
It's a mess

395
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,416
If you care about me

396
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,296
you won't let me leave empty-handed,
will you?

397
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,664
That's exactly how you'll leave today

398
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,294
A man's going to starve

399
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,169
Let him starve.
Japs are monsters anyway

400
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,041
That's no good. If they starve,
our village is done for

401
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,511
I'd rather die than be a collaborator

402
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,912
What are you talking about?

403
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,015
This guy risks his neck to bring ‘em,
asks us to look after ‘em

404
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,052
And we let ‘em starve?

405
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,129
What's a collaborator?
That's a collaborator

406
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,700
Keep talking, there's no flour

407
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,860
Then…

408
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,698
what's in here?

409
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,207
- Nothing.
- There's flour inside the chest

410
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,278
in a cloth bag

411
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,404
- Who told you that?
- Who?

412
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,248
The one who keeps secrets.
He tells me stuff too

413
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,378
That dam n son of mine.
I don't care anyway. There is none

414
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,822
Auntie

415
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,383
How's this?
I'll repay you double what I take

416
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,760
- Triple it. There's none.
- Four times

417
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,298
Five times
and there's still none

418
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,794
How about six?

419
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,530
Seven and I'll give none

420
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,101
All right, eight then

421
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,542
Dong. Teach me some Chinese

422
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,181
- Why?
- I want to swear at them

423
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,581
To use the most terrible words

424
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,712
I'll infuriate them

425
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,983
and they'll have to kill me

426
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,319
The Chinese hate people

427
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,351
who curse their ancestors

428
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,759
Bastard!
Teach me now

429
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,670
Yes, sir

430
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,369
cut it out

431
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,881
At a time like this,
thinking of that

432
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,948
You've heard them call us
brother and sister-in-law

433
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:49,155
Besides, when I saw Auntie,
I told her all about us

434
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,727
What'd you say?

435
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:55,128
I said… it is what it is

436
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,030
Have you no shame?

437
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,932
She said no story, no flour

438
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,506
She wasn't nasty about it

439
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,571
Things are what they are.
Why not just admit it?

440
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,807
Don't push it

441
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,582
They've all been too busy
to think about us

442
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,811
After tonight, when those two leave

443
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,878
how can I walk in the streets
with everyone talking behind my back?

444
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,784
What can I do?

445
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,493
If a big man like you doesn't know,
why ask me?

446
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,467
Well

447
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,238
I'll… marry you

448
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,075
You have to anyway

449
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,405
- What are you saying?
- You have no choice

450
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,314
- Who's there?
- Me

451
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,408
It's him

452
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,226
It's me

453
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,420
Don't use that word.
It scares me

454
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,988
I've got their statement.
When that guy comes

455
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,159
give him this.
I'm glad I didn't forget

456
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,336
Anyway, we've done it

457
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,699
Right

458
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,834
Once they've left

459
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,105
we can celebrate New Year's
all over again

460
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,893
They're here, Dong

461
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,929
The time's come

462
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,741
I hear their footsteps

463
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,777
I can see them taking up
their weapons

464
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,649
I want to turn the curses
you've taught me

465
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,651
into bullets to fire at them

466
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,951
I want to enrage them

467
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,091
Insult them

468
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,893
Enrage them

469
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,097
Insult them

470
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:14,905
Dong

471
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,804
Good-bye forever!

472
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,080
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!

473
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,275
You're my granddad,
I'm your son!

474
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,483
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

475
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,113
You're my granddad

476
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,584
I'm your son

477
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,288
The words are nice.
Why does he sound so angry?

478
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,366
Japs sound the same
whether they're happy or angry

479
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,264
Why do you think we call them devils?

480
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,933
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!

481
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,234
You're my granddad

482
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,634
I'm your son

483
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,871
Enough, enough

484
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,413
I get the message

485
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,541
But your generations are mixed up.
If I'm your granddad

486
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:05,180
you're my grandson.
Not my son. See?

487
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,723
How come they're not angry?

488
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,691
The Japanese are always cursing them

489
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,056
They're used to it

490
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,493
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!

491
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,033
Okay, okay. Shush.
Twice is enough

492
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,035
We've made you dumplings

493
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,329
Just what you asked for

494
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,839
- Did you teach him that?
- Yes. It's the spring festival

495
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,467
I taught him propitious phrases
to thank you both

496
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,135
Nice of you

497
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:32,409
Now, eat up. It's your last chance

498
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,153
By tonight, you'll be on the road

499
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,481
- Let's bring the table over.
- Okay

500
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,085
Hold on. We'll set this up.
Eat heartily

501
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,550
Hoarders

502
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,888
I'll kill you for sure

503
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,161
- No chance of that.
- Why not?

504
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,431
“On the road” means “to die”
in Chinese

505
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,530
This is our last meal

506
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,875
We're goners

507
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,935
Why don't they act
like they're gonna kill us?

508
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,015
Even when the Chinese kill someone,
their expression doesn't change

509
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,413
How are they gonna kill us?

510
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,219
- You afraid of dying?
- Of course not

511
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,124
I just feel stupid dying this way

512
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,355
But I'm not afraid

513
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,558
I won't beg for mercy.
I won't

514
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,105
Shall we do it?

515
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,108
Move aside

516
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,011
Let ‘em finish their meal

517
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,573
Untie them

518
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,652
Please, one favor

519
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:54,596
Send my parents a message for me,
in the northeast

520
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,328
Of course. Don't worry

521
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,830
You'll be on the road soon

522
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,933
And whatever happens, happens

523
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,412
Enjoy your dumplings

524
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,773
All right! I will!

525
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,982
And then I'll go on the road

526
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,114
I lived by my mouth.
Now I'll die by it

527
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,454
If only I hadn't learned Japanese

528
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,021
In my next life,
I'll come back a mute

529
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,620
Eat up

530
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,531
Or we'll be late

531
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:36,029
Tell him we've still got to trouble you
to get back into those sacks

532
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,107
What?

533
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,438
They're putting us back
into those sacks

534
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,883
What now?

535
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,352
The Japs are like this.
They cry, they sing

536
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,497
Well, maybe

537
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,893
before he goes,
we should give him a drink?

538
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,326
I want a drink

539
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,529
He'd like a drink

540
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,703
Just what we were thinking

541
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,672
Let's get some wine from old man Qi

542
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,016
San

543
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,292
Do you think
they'll give us a reward?

544
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,559
Advance

545
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,501
- It's time for lunch.
- I'm not going

546
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,366
Not going to the block house
For lunch?

547
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:51,032
No. We're having
Chinese chicken today

548
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,109
You serious?

549
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,644
Knowhow to get a chicken
from a Chinese?

550
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,838
“Excuse me, may I have a chicken?”

551
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,781
Idiot. You wouldn't get
a fart that way

552
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,181
Watch me

553
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,080
Bastard! Handover that chicken!

554
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,621
Bastard! Handover that chicken!

555
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,130
You're pathetic. You'll get thrashed.
Watch me

556
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,397
You gotta stare 'em down.
Act like a devil and scare 'em

557
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,800
Get it?

558
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,967
Bastard! Give me that chicken!

559
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,837
Holy crap!

560
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,873
What the hell?
Halt!

561
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,851
Bastard

562
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,683
You scared the shit out of me

563
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,847
What you do?

564
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,754
I'm from the village

565
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,326
No leave village

566
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,861
- You go back.
- Go

567
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,562
Go over there

568
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,932
Come here

569
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,373
Head down

570
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,438
Here, have another.
Come here

571
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,853
Stand back

572
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,290
- No go out, understand?
- Yes

573
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,953
- No go out.
- I understand

574
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,224
Understand? Son of a bitch

575
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,758
- Understand?
- Yes

576
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,732
- Good.
- Yes

577
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,132
Let's go

578
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,365
See?
That's how you deal with them

579
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,998
I see

580
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,202
Hold on. Get it

581
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,787
Don't let it get away

582
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,083
Halt

583
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,193
You're back?

584
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,228
What's wrong? Speak

585
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,530
What's all this?
Say something

586
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,072
I'm going to eat you

587
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,533
Look, it's him

588
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,281
You. Damn it.
What are you doing here?

589
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,079
I ordered you to stay
inside the circle. Bastard!

590
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:19,850
Japanese

591
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,520
Japanese

592
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,753
You must be dreaming

593
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,430
No step out. Understand?

594
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,637
- Yes.
- Maruyama. The chicken

595
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,114
captain-san.
This what you're after?

596
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,450
- Bastard. Handover that chicken.
- Forget it, moron

597
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,817
captain-san

598
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,551
Want me to kill it?

599
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,052
- Now you're talking.
- Let's sit over there

600
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,289
- No.
- Bastard!

601
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,198
I heard it. “Bastard.”

602
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,036
It's for real

603
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,707
Japanese speaking Japanese

604
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,835
Soldiers of the Imperial Army

605
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,111
You stay here.
I'll get some kids to make noise

606
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,209
The Japs want more water

607
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,847
It's true.
There are Japanese up there

608
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,049
Thank heavens

609
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,559
- How'd they get here?
- I ran into them

610
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,754
- You idiot.
- Knock your block off

611
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,928
captain-san

612
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,598
Go fan the fire

613
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,503
Our chicken is nearly ready

614
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm going to scream

615
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,308
They still won't hear you

616
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,877
Hanaya.
I've got an idea

617
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,253
Don't worry about us

618
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,845
We've got our own lunch

619
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,388
We'll save you the bones

620
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,585
It's goddamn delicious

621
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,525
Why did he hit you?

622
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,325
- I said knock your block off.,,
- can't you say the opposite?

623
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,399
Well, you try

624
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,092
I can only say bakayaro.
It's worse

625
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,533
Say baka-no-yaro

626
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,072
cut the crap. I'll watch them.
If they head for the cellar

627
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,435
I'll take ‘em on

628
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,086
Please save us

629
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,888
Please save us!

630
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,286
Attack!

631
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,415
Son of a bitch

632
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,421
Sensei

633
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,655
San, he's gone inside

634
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,957
Move. Move

635
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,428
What are you doing with that?

636
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,969
captain-san.
It's for killing the donkey

637
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,771
- Donkey?
- Eat donkey

638
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,074
This moron is terrified
at the very sight of us

639
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,044
He thinks we can eat
a donkey

640
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,478
Idiot

641
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,950
♪That pretty maid♪

642
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,997
♪Is a bird on high♪

643
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,797
♪I'm going to do my best --♪

644
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,029
Maruyama. Get your gun

645
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,132
What are you doing?

646
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,868
I'm getting you another chicken

647
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,449
This guy-- very good

648
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,380
Save it. We eat next time

649
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,475
- Understand?
- Yes

650
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,351
- We should be at our posts.
- Right. Playtime's over.

651
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,656
Two telephone lines to set up

652
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,126
Why's he always waving
a knife around?

653
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,524
Go back. No move

654
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:52,164
- You scared?
- Course not. Not with you around.

655
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,299
Sensei

656
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,771
Look at this

657
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:00,844
Dam n it

658
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,939
What now?

659
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,640
That idiot is still inside the circle

660
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,980
You're something else.
You've got these mongrels worked out

661
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,144
My respects

662
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,382
I can teach you a few things.
I'm still learning too

663
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,392
- You? Still learning?
- You're never too old to learn

664
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,121
How was that chicken?

665
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,787
Delicious

666
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,891
- Fucking bastards.
- What are you doing?

667
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:25,969
Where's he going?

668
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,467
Japanese soldiers!
They're coming!

669
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,202
Fuck you, J ap. Fuck

670
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,301
Fucking bastards!

671
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,884
Move!
Turtle-fuckers!

672
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,449
What the fuck is this about?

673
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,156
So you pull this on me?

674
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,432
Trying to get me killed?

675
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,930
Get this straight

676
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:02,165
You try and get me killed
and I'll kill you first

677
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,904
I left the village

678
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,535
crossed the river

679
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,170
climbed the mountain

680
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,872
entered the town

681
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,574
went to ask for Pockmarked Li

682
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,016
- Get to the point.
- This is the point

683
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,054
You always leave the village,
cross the river

684
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,318
If I didn't leave the village,
how could I cross the river?

685
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,188
- Give me some water.
- Go on

686
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,725
- Where was I?
- crossing the river --

687
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,023
Get to the point

688
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,531
- You saw Pockmarked Li.
- I didn't say that

689
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,228
- Yes, you did.
- I said I saw captain Five

690
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,305
What did captain Five say?

691
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,135
He said,
“Didn't I tell you what to do?”

692
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,869
I said,
“No, I've never met you before.”

693
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,740
He said, “Are you from Lower Village?”

694
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,336
I said, “No.
I'm from Rack-Armor Terrace.”

695
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,006
He said, “Rack-Armor Terrace?

696
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,085
We've never left anyone there.
Do whatever you have to.”

697
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,983
I said, “Like what?”

698
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,249
He said, “Isn't there
a blockhouse there?

699
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,087
What are you waiting for?
Do the deed.”

700
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,728
So this captain said “do the deed.”

701
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,265
Yeah.
He gestured like this

702
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,299
“Do it.”

703
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,931
Tell us again.
What was that gesture?

704
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,505
Was it like this? Or like that?

705
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,404
- Show me again.
- Like this? Or like that?

706
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,072
- Like this.
- So he meant kill ‘em

707
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,080
- No.
- What do you mean?

708
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,343
Like this. Like this

709
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,510
Of course he meant kill ‘em

710
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,515
Looks like it

711
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,084
There's an old saying:
Better to obey than have respects to pay

712
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,661
Well, better obey then

713
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,393
Old Uncle, if he wanted us to kill ‘em,
why didn't he say so?

714
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,467
Why say “do the deed”?

715
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,095
Men in high positions
can't always say what they mean

716
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:45,505
It was so clear. First those guys
yelled out to the brass band

717
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,208
Then, today,
they tagged the chicken

718
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,041
What's next?
Our necks are on the line

719
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,017
Did he say how to do it?

720
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,450
No

721
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,145
Or who should do it?

722
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,351
No. He doesn't know us.
How could he?

723
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,029
He knows you

724
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,624
He thought I was from Lower Village.
I never saw him before

725
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,337
- This is a hard one.
- What's so hard?

726
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,531
There's peeling the skin.,

727
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,369
Japs are all bastards.
More water

728
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,204
You peel one, I'll throttle ‘em

729
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,073
Twist their necks and bury ‘em!

730
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,168
Shut up

731
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,053
Bury ‘em?
That's an idea

732
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,715
So…

733
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,882
- San.
- Old Uncle

734
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,285
It's not that I'm afraid.
How can I put this?

735
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,654
It's just not right

736
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,997
We were told to look after them

737
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:49,001
We can't just decide to kill them.
It's not good

738
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,337
Besides, that captain Five
who Li u Wang found

739
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,433
didn't drop ‘em on us

740
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,572
H is orders don't count

741
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:02,215
What if captain Four or captain Seven
comes for ‘em? What then?

742
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,050
So why don't you go yourself?
Go find captain Four or Seven

743
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,748
Don't be stupid

744
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,954
It's up to you really.
You got them here. Shouldn't you do it?

745
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,221
What? I got them here?

746
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,268
You think I went to their homes
and invited them round?

747
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,005
I had a gun to my head.
That's how I got them

748
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:26,038
He forced me to look after them.
If we don't, he'll kill us all

749
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,537
These last six months, I've eaten badly,
hardly slept, and I'm in debt

750
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,274
While you all slept soundly

751
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,149
I haven't been under a quilt
all winter

752
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,849
Why? Isn't it for our whole village?

753
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,155
Give me that water

754
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,887
Slurping all over the place

755
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,454
Dasan's got a point

756
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,294
- Of course I do.
- Well…

757
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,435
- Er Bozi?
- Don't look at me like that

758
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,735
I'm not a coward.
You must have a good reason to do that

759
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,742
I've got a big mouth.
Just like my mother

760
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,870
One slip of the tongue
and we're all done for

761
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:07,644
We are still here
because I've kept my mouth shut

762
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,952
I sensei this and that all day long
to keep from talking

763
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,522
That's my contribution

764
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,650
Some contribution. Sensei.
You collaborator

765
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,320
- You do it then.
- Well, Li u Wang?

766
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:23,957
Me? I could do it. What am I afraid of?
But let's get this straight

767
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,662
You know the saying
stick your neck out,,? That's me

768
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,035
I was nearly killed today

769
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,577
Why do I go on about the village,
the river? Because it makes me sick

770
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,670
In my dreams it's leave,
cross, leave, cross

771
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,315
And you scold me for slurping?
Give me that

772
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,051
I'll throttle ‘em
and we'll dig a pit and bury ‘em

773
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,952
Shut up! Shut up!

774
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,654
If none of you will do it, I will

775
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,620
- That's not right.
- No?

776
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,722
We'll draw lots then.
Fate will decide

777
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,568
Whoever gets the red bean is it

778
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,565
Old Uncle,
it's too big a job for one person

779
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,803
Well, add a second one

780
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,565
Forget it.
I've got both

781
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,680
Give me some water

782
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,183
Give him some water

783
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,514
Here you go, San

784
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,161
San

785
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,558
What can I say?

786
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,264
What's there to say?
Leave ‘em to me. I'll throttle ‘em --

787
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,931
Shut up!

788
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,376
I need two people.
Helpers

789
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,544
- I'll dig the pit.
- So will I

790
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,620
Good

791
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,814
You two dig the pit.
Dasan will do the deed

792
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,892
Let's not put it off.
Let's move tonight. Agreed?

793
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,085
Yes

794
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,319
San. The hole's ready

795
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,188
It's right here.
We'll wait down there

796
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,366
They've brought this over for you

797
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,632
To help you over the shock

798
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,304
Er Bozi's mother says

799
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,780
don't worry about repaying the flour

800
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,584
She says try and put it
out of your head

801
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,218
- Eat up. I'm off.
- Yu'er

802
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,221
What is it?

803
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,551
Yu'er

804
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,800
Don't touch me!
Whatever you do, don't touch me

805
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,327
If for nothing else

806
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,167
for the child in my belly

807
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,469
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me

808
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,152
- Who's there?
- Me

809
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,549
Stop saying me.,

810
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,122
Here's some food

811
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,292
- Where's your mom?
- She's not coming

812
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,459
No?

813
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,700
This is terrible!

814
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:13,981
Uncle San

815
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,779
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!

816
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,338
I didn't kill anyone

817
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,206
That's it

818
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,391
Advance!

819
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,772
- You.
- What's with you?

820
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,072
Anybody see you?

821
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,649
No one

822
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,215
Quick. Shut the door

823
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,041
Ma, I'm back

824
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,912
So you are

825
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,815
Only one candy today.
What's with Uncle?

826
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,615
Nothing. Don't worry

827
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,316
- I'm going to Grandpa's.
- Off you go

828
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,231
Yu'er

829
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:49,669
Let's…

830
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,037
run away

831
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,474
We'll take Little Thresher

832
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,874
and the old man

833
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,947
Well?

834
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:05,185
Starting tomorrow,
don't take them any food

835
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,849
What?

836
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,823
If I don't, who will?

837
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,895
There are Japanese captives
inside the Great Wall

838
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,854
There are Japanese captives
inside the Great Wall

839
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:20,334
Too long.
The kid'll never remember it.

840
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,135
True

841
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,035
Nihonjin means uncle

842
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,630
Chojo is candy

843
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,176
Iruyo is give

844
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,677
Repeat after me

845
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,942
Nihonjin chojo iruyo

846
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,386
“Japanese inside the Great Wall. ”

847
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,013
You say it

848
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,991
Japanese inside the Great Wall

849
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,626
He can do it!

850
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,100
Japanese inside the Great Wall

851
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,551
Japanese. Japanese

852
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,821
Japanese

853
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:26,936
Japs?

854
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,597
Sensei

855
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,468
Sensei

856
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,505
The great Japanese

857
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,746
The great Japanese have no candy
for you today

858
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,952
- chop off my head!
- What are you doing?

859
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,285
Me too! Go ahead!

860
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,359
I can explain!

861
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,452
- Those guys are at Fenghuotai?
- Yes, inside the wall

862
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:54,996
You taking them food?

863
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,224
They still alive?

864
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,266
- Yes. Listen --
- Why?

865
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,835
Enough's been said

866
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,769
First they shout out to the brass band

867
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,073
then they tag the chicken

868
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:10,373
Now they're using Little Thresher.
Three times unlucky

869
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,475
We're going to lose our heads

870
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,982
No doubt about it

871
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,915
- I ask you. Should they be killed?
- Sure

872
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,285
So why didn't you do it?
It's either them or us

873
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,985
Where'd those guys come from?
Who brought them?

874
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:28,291
What are you saying?
I don't know who brought ‘em here

875
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,390
You don't?
It would take at least two men

876
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,969
to drag those two sacks.
Even four

877
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,970
Four? Try five or six

878
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,336
And you saw nothing?

879
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,466
- Don't you have eyes?
- They were closed

880
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,445
Really? You opened the door?
You did it with your eyes closed?

881
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,447
No, I closed ‘em after

882
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,813
I say you saw everything

883
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,978
I didn't. It was dark.
I couldn't see a thing

884
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,148
cut it out.
Tell us what you're getting out of this

885
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,953
Nothing

886
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:01,463
Nothing? I don't believe it.
If not, why protect them?

887
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,965
You said you'd pay me back eightfold.
Where's that coming from?

888
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,400
Yes, we all see through it now

889
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:10,495
You're just bullshitting about
the threat to the village

890
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,632
Who is this killer? Let him come

891
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:17,372
I'll sit at home and wait.
Is he going to kill me? Would he dare?

892
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,777
Only your life's in danger

893
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,941
- can you pipe down?
- Pipe down?

894
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,179
What am I afraid of?
The Japs have been here for eight years

895
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,085
Eight years

896
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,090
And have they touched a hair
on my head?

897
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,990
My behavior is right and proper

898
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,928
Wherever I go, they look up to me

899
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,623
Ma. Enough

900
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,201
Little Thresher, don't hide.
You speak Japanese?

901
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,395
You can go to the blockhouse

902
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,135
but First show Uncle San
what you've learned

903
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,673
Go on

904
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,572
The Japanese are inside the Great Wall

905
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,506
Don't hit him!
H it me if you dare!

906
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,047
come on!

907
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,342
I'll be frank

908
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,888
The child in my belly was conceived
the night those men came here

909
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,651
If Dasan kills ‘em,
it will curse my baby

910
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,286
You want us to kill ‘em?
And then you ignore us?

911
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,856
Dasan looks like a ghost

912
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,534
Now that they're still alive,
you come at us with this business

913
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,332
We can't do anything right.
You know all the answers

914
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,237
We didn't kill anybody.
We can't kill and we won't!

915
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,704
We can't

916
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,773
I'm afraid. I couldn't do it

917
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,451
Yu'er, how can you talk like that?

918
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:39,358
We all see what's going on
between you and Dasan

919
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,259
but have we said anything?

920
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,856
You defend him
like he's your husband

921
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,800
If you can't kill anyone,
why should we?

922
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,600
You're scared to bear a cursed child.
And us?

923
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,698
We'll all be cursed souls soon enough

924
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,939
Dasan. I want my flour back.
Eightfold. Pay me back now

925
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,675
Look at yourself.
Do you look like a man?

926
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,718
Whether Dasan's a man or not
is for me to say

927
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,788
Don't tell me
you'd know better than me

928
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,220
Wanna go to the blockhouse?
Go then!

929
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,759
I'll lead you there!

930
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,359
No big deal!

931
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,759
I'll tell you this, though

932
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,959
If they come down after us,
no one will escape

933
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,896
We'll all pay with our lives.
Who are you threatening?

934
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,073
If we go, we die

935
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,442
and if we stay, we die

936
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,811
If it's all the same,
just behead me now

937
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,884
Please, get it over with.
Otherwise, I'm not moving

938
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,182
Say something, Old Uncle

939
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,280
Good fortune is having no troubles,
but misfortune can't be avoided

940
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,052
I'm the youngest.
Kill me first

941
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,618
I'm in this too.
Let him kill us all. Here

942
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,623
Don't push me

943
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,737
If you push me,
I could do anything

944
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,942
Fine. It's not too late for action

945
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,876
- I'll help you dig the trench.
- Me too

946
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,848
- Let's do it.
- Me?

947
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,951
Do it?

948
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,281
I'll run away

949
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,559
Next

950
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:22,731
Come here

951
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,235
- It's all beans.
-All right

952
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,675
- Move.
- Hold on! Halt!

953
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,147
Show me

954
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,925
Show me

955
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,300
This way

956
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:08,370
Beard, different with photo

957
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,873
Cut short

958
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,470
Understand?

959
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,783
- Cut short.
- Short

960
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,882
- Understand, you?
- I understand

961
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:20,956
Move it

962
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,059
Next

963
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,960
Bearded guy, come here

964
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:31,690
Welcome the Japanese
to the neighborhood

965
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,894
800 years ago,
we were all one brood

966
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,766
We all write with characters

967
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,737
and our soups use pickles

968
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,434
When they beat us,
it really tickles

969
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,171
If they call me bakayaro,
I think it's good

970
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:47,909
The Imperial Army
gives us “mixi” food

971
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:54,889
We love the Imperial Army
like family --

972
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,444
- Where you from?
- Rack-Armor Terrace

973
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,777
- Name?
- Dasan

974
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,275
- Who sent you?
- Old Uncle

975
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,952
Old Uncle?

976
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,155
No wonder you called me
brother-in-law

977
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,456
What's up?

978
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,959
Well, where to start?

979
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,334
You want to hi re an assassin

980
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,804
Am I right?

981
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,703
Didn't Old Uncle tell you
about my marksmanship?

982
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,110
He said you can hit a fly
at 1 00 paces

983
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:56,947
That's right -- but with a gun.
A nine-chamber automatic

984
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,013
The further the target,
the more accurate the shot

985
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,645
Naturally

986
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,749
There's a blockhouse
at Rack-Armor Terrace, yeah?

987
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,690
Yeah

988
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,592
- The village is as small as an ass cheek?
- Yeah

989
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,722
How can you use a gun then?

990
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,891
This is a job for a sword

991
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:16,529
But Old Uncle is asking you.
You can't say no, can you?

992
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,539
- can't do it.
- You can't do it?

993
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,938
can't do it

994
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,940
All right

995
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,375
- What are you doing?
- Going home

996
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,505
You can go,
but you gotta leave the beans

997
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:30,446
What? You won't help,
but you want the beans?

998
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,216
I can't help you out,
but you gotta leave them

999
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,391
You want to kill a Jap

1000
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,157
but don't want anyone to know, right?

1001
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:40,491
Right

1002
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,530
- It's a secret, right?
- Yeah

1003
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:46,294
So, I'll keep your secret.
It's like this

1004
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,861
If I don't take something as payment

1005
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,166
how can you trust me to keep quiet?

1006
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:57,977
I don't need your beans.
I just want you to feel okay about this

1007
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,612
Silly man.
You've simply come to the wrong place

1008
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:07,213
I make tofu. If you throw in sorghum,
would it still be tofu?

1009
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:11,054
The more sorghum you put in,
the less it'll be like tofu

1010
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,560
In the future, remember:
if you want a swordsman

1011
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,860
don't go to the one with the gun.
Do you get my logic?

1012
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,333
- No.
- No?

1013
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,194
Let me show you what I mean

1014
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,863
Attention!

1015
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,316
Attention!

1016
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,628
What'll we do?
Take a detour

1017
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,994
Halt.
What are we afraid of?

1018
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,066
Running means
we've done wrong

1019
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,039
Sensei

1020
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,947
Get down

1021
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:16,683
They must have lost this battle.
They usually kowtow before me

1022
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,158
They're back.
Yayoi. Look

1023
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,024
They've been gone so long

1024
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,329
At last they're back

1025
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,257
Yayoi, what's wrong?

1026
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,531
Matsuno?

1027
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,607
Matsuno!

1028
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,110
Idiots! Go back Inside!

1029
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,280
What's all this fuss?
Shameless hussy

1030
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,853
Look at him

1031
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,692
You need wits and bravery

1032
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,926
Silly man

1033
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,558
It's not just a family matter

1034
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,927
Besides,
I've got a Chinese heart too

1035
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,292
So you do

1036
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,669
Let's go

1037
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,141
Brother-in-law.
Where are you taking me?

1038
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,339
- To the military police.
- What?

1039
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,482
To the bathhouse

1040
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,420
You know the em press Tz'u-hsi?

1041
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,497
Yeah

1042
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,626
How about the eight ministers?

1043
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,963
Yeah. U h, no

1044
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,533
Didn't think you would

1045
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,130
Darlings of the court.
All beheaded

1046
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,539
Know who wielded the sword?

1047
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,505
No

1048
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,872
- Old man Li u.
- Really?

1049
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,651
The day of the beheadings,
a sea of people surrounded North Gate

1050
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,222
It was packed

1051
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:57,224
- South Gate.
- Right, South Gate

1052
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,385
Did they come to see
the eight ministers?

1053
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:00,462
No

1054
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,929
They cheered at every head
old man Li u cut

1055
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,695
Watching him use his sword
was like tasting the finest wine

1056
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,727
They even celebrated it in poems

1057
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:17,268
Old man Li u, does he worry
that people will hate him?

1058
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,940
No. They never hate him.
They're grateful

1059
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,445
The descendants of those he's executed
bring him gifts

1060
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,044
every day, every year,
every generation

1061
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,283
Old man Li u,
which generation are we up to?

1062
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,887
See? The fifth generation

1063
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,022
Do you know why?

1064
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,767
No

1065
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:42,098
Because he's helped them
up to heaven

1066
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,832
H is blade is like a passing breeze

1067
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,137
Before they know it,
they're in the land of the immortals

1068
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,270
Their last vision
is of Li u with his sword

1069
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,046
Gratitude wells up within them

1070
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,074
You know how they show it?

1071
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,013
No

1072
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,718
Their head
rolls exactly nine times

1073
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,950
looks back at him
and blinks three times

1074
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,650
The corners of their mouths turn up

1075
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,197
You've heard of greeting death
with a smile,,? That's it

1076
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,391
Say no more

1077
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,429
What can I give you to do this job?

1078
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:19,940
Oh. If old man Li u likes you,
he won't take a cent

1079
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,909
If he doesn't,
mountains of gold won't move him

1080
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,277
Say no more. Old man Li u

1081
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,247
I can't even offer you beans

1082
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:32,087
But I'll kowtow on behalf
of my whole village

1083
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:39,319
“The Great Wall still stands,

1084
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:43,996
yet the emperor ch'in Shih Huang
is no more!”

1085
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,672
Few Imperial Army soldiers
get taken prisoner

1086
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,170
Fewer still are
the prisoners of peasants

1087
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,604
I might be the only one

1088
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,039
Oh, Fate

1089
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:38,085
At least I've killed about
20 Chinese

1090
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,719
Worthless though their lives were

1091
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,460
Aren't 20 lives worth your one?

1092
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,858
Sure

1093
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,260
The Chinese are people too

1094
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,557
It's a pity

1095
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,169
A soldier should die in battle

1096
01:12:57,272 --> 01:13:00,571
To die at the hands of these peasants

1097
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,671
is so unheroic

1098
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,247
Heroic?

1099
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,349
I can help you

1100
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,513
How the hell can you help me?

1101
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,052
I could eat your flesh

1102
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,452
like sashimi

1103
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:19,356
Shut your traps.
For fuck's sake

1104
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,079
What do you think?

1105
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,474
I'm speechless.
You're a master

1106
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,884
How's the time?

1107
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,045
The moon is bright, the stars are few.
Perfect

1108
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,452
And how are they?

1109
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,320
- They've eaten their last meals.
- Let's do it

1110
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,457
A Jap?

1111
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,227
I'm speechless

1112
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,724
A Chinese?

1113
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,464
- Words fail me.
- The Jap first

1114
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,626
collect the corpses

1115
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,425
- You've worked hard.
- It was nothing

1116
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,838
He's still alive! Grab him!

1117
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,869
- They're not dead!
- Impossible

1118
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,446
They're jumping around!

1119
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,981
Headless chickens
jump around too

1120
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:49,747
Stop

1121
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,116
But their heads are still
on their shoulders

1122
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,155
Let me go!

1123
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,190
- Got him?
- Grab him

1124
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,122
- What's going on?
- They're not dead

1125
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,024
Try again!

1126
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,860
I'm not called
“One Strike Liu” for nothing.

1127
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:09,700
They're just not fated to die

1128
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:14,569
My brilliant reputation has been
destroyed in an instant

1129
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:19,636
I never imagined that because of you
I'd lose my honor

1130
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,579
Especially this late in life!

1131
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:27,779
Heaven help me!

1132
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,492
Old Uncle.
The slate is clean between us

1133
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,124
All of you take care.
We'll meet again

1134
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,007
But -- But --

1135
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,611
Teach me to curse my emperor.
They'd love that

1136
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,339
They don't know who he is

1137
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,178
Teach me to say nice things.
I'll do anything not to be killed

1138
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:59,413
Hanaya, you've said all the n ice things
there are to say

1139
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:00,488
What?

1140
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,216
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1141
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,121
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.,

1142
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,057
- I won't say that again.
- Remember?

1143
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,992
I'll never curse them again

1144
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,392
You never did curse them

1145
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,866
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1146
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:17,166
You're my grand dad,
I'm your son.

1147
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,633
That's what it meant

1148
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,804
You tricked me!

1149
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,342
Educated people are so evil

1150
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:35,112
I hate you educated people!

1151
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:39,057
- What sort of shitty samurai are you?
- I'm no samurai! I'm a peasant!

1152
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,324
My family raises silk
Not samurai!

1153
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,559
If a warrior dies with no witnesses,
he's no warrior!

1154
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,795
You're no fucking actor either,
just a sergeant

1155
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:53,841
I hate stupid Japanese people like you!

1156
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,475
Low life peasant!

1157
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,606
No fucking dignity at all!

1158
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,651
You're the lowlife!

1159
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,583
- Worse than the peasants!
- Bastard

1160
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,520
The people here gave up

1161
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,320
their own rations

1162
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:14,293
to keep us alive these six months

1163
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:19,700
That woman even dressed my wounds

1164
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,167
She's got feelings for me

1165
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,898
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1166
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,100
She'd do the same for me
if I was wounded

1167
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,509
- You're so pathetic!
- Bastard!

1168
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,011
Stop it. Stop it

1169
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,377
- Shut up!
- Shut up

1170
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,145
It's not going to save
your fucking life

1171
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,656
I've got an idea

1172
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:45,651
Hanaya says

1173
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,162
if we take them back home,
we'll get two carts of grain

1174
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,428
It'll be New Year's Day every day

1175
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,432
Lives for grain

1176
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:02,710
- You go.
- You go

1177
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,335
- You first.
- You first

1178
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,743
Speak

1179
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,474
I say no deal

1180
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,914
- I agree. No deal.
- No deal

1181
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,486
- Why not?
- Don't know. Doesn't feel right

1182
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,214
- I say let's do it.
- Why?

1183
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,221
Why not?

1184
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,315
I al ready said why.
It doesn't feel right

1185
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:21,692
That's not enough.
What'll we gain by not doing it?

1186
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,833
If you say no, take ‘em home yourselves
and look after ‘em like a wife

1187
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,231
What'll we gain?

1188
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,030
You tell us
what the disadvantages are?

1189
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,571
What if that guy comes back for ‘em?

1190
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:35,575
He said he'd be here on New Year's Eve.
Half a year has passed

1191
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,108
What if he never comes?
We gonna keep ‘em our whole lives?

1192
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:42,308
Does a deal
count as collaboration?

1193
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,853
collaboration?
You always throw that word around

1194
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,745
You help Japs kill Chinese,
you're a collaborator

1195
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:50,757
But asking them for some grain?

1196
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:54,488
If you return the Jap but don't ask
for grain, that's collaboration

1197
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,032
Who grew it anyway?
We Chinese did

1198
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,364
We've got our backs to the sun.
Our sweat flows, irrigating the soil

1199
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,438
Why should the Japs
get it for free?

1200
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,067
I'll take the grain from their mouths
and put it in ours

1201
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:13,576
And not just ours.
All our relatives will get their share

1202
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,285
That's collaborating?
You'd call me a collaborator for that?

1203
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,374
Well, no

1204
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,284
If everyone was like us

1205
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,685
and took the Japs
and traded ‘em in

1206
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,024
what would the world be like then?

1207
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,096
The Japs would be the collaborators

1208
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,788
Say we agree

1209
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,089
- I say no.
- Explain yourself

1210
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,464
You're in with sensei,
but I slapped Hanaya

1211
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,662
True.
And what about One Strike Liu?

1212
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,967
- Say we disagree.
- What do you mean?

1213
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,905
I was gonna say

1214
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:44,342
Li u Wang,
the fact you hit Hanaya hardly counts

1215
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,946
How often have the Japs hit you?

1216
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,810
One Strike Liu
is a more serious matter

1217
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:52,546
What do we do then?

1218
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:54,485
I've been thinking about it

1219
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:58,047
We'll say the guy
who captured ‘em came back

1220
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,284
to kill them

1221
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,058
We talked ourselves blue in the face,
but got rid of him

1222
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,134
saving their lives.
That's believable

1223
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:10,000
- I believe it.
- And why not? They're not dead

1224
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:15,133
We saved ‘em, didn't we?
And for that, they're gonna punish you?

1225
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,102
They've got to reward you

1226
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,645
It still doesn't feel right

1227
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,374
Why not?

1228
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,013
I found One Strike Liu,
and I'm not worried

1229
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,985
You won't eat food that's
put in your mouth? Are you a coward?

1230
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,719
I give you men. You give us grain.
I've done you no wrong

1231
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,626
Would you treat me badly?
Aren't our hearts made of flesh?

1232
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,028
I'll throttle ‘em both

1233
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:41,224
- and twist their necks like fried dough.
- Forget the fried dough

1234
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,667
No flour, no fried dough

1235
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,772
Li u Wang is right.
No flour, no fried dough

1236
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,036
If we don't go,
we can't get the grain

1237
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:52,312
Grain.
There'll be enough grain

1238
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,049
to feed the whole village for a year

1239
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,849
Auntie, I said
I'd pay you back eightfold

1240
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,388
It'll be eighty-fold

1241
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,718
- You said it, not me.
- I sure did

1242
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,458
Forget the two carts of grain

1243
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:10,087
If it was two carts of shit,
I'd still do it

1244
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,722
I'd do it for nothing

1245
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,630
I don't want them another day

1246
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,496
If you're scared, don't come.
Fine. I'll go myself

1247
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:20,498
I'll take those two carts of grain
bag by bag

1248
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,635
I'll bring it back to you myself.
I'll deliver it

1249
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,675
and put it in your mouths if I have to.
You'll eat it and be grateful

1250
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,018
And you'll feel remorse in your gut

1251
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,556
cal m down.
No one said they weren't going

1252
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,352
- No.
- No

1253
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,155
So, we're going?
What an effort

1254
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,719
Give me some water

1255
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,232
Why do you have to make him cry?

1256
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,858
Yes.
I'll make the decision for us

1257
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,867
Hanaya wants to see you

1258
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,767
Yes

1259
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,678
Hanaya.
I want to ask you three things

1260
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,079
Answer truthfully

1261
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:06,119
How will you guarantee our safety

1262
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:10,716
and how will you raise
the question of the grain?

1263
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,423
I'll tell you how

1264
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,056
We all come
from the same county

1265
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,065
Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka
is from my village

1266
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,931
We grew up together. We're friends.
Translate

1267
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,834
He says:

1268
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:28,069
We all come from the same village.
I know captain Sakatsuka

1269
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:29,643
We grew up together.,

1270
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:32,406
No wonder. The same village

1271
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:36,075
- So he's a peasant too. Just like us.
- A son of the soil

1272
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:37,412
Yes, that's it

1273
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:38,645
I'm a son of the soil

1274
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:42,450
But I'm a sergeant too,
in charge of food supplies

1275
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:47,119
The Imperial Army has a policy
of rewarding those who help it

1276
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:50,095
So I can promise
you will get your grain

1277
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:51,460
He says --

1278
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:55,696
And I also want to say
that I've been well treated here

1279
01:22:55,804 --> 01:23:00,104
You saved my life.
You'll be perfectly safe. Translate!

1280
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,576
I'm a sergeant
in charge of foodstuffs

1281
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:08,115
The Imperial Army rewards those
who help it. You'll get your grain

1282
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,878
You've looked after me well

1283
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,717
You saved my life.
Your safety is guaranteed.,

1284
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,990
I thought he was a cook.
Now he's a sergeant?

1285
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,587
Brother, I was afraid you were going
to kill us. So I made that up

1286
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,029
Made it up?

1287
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,499
Maybe you've made up all this too

1288
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:31,094
At a time like this, would I dare?

1289
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,195
What?

1290
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,242
They're afraid I'm making this up

1291
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,410
You better not be, Dong!
It's a matter of life and death!

1292
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,412
Stop lying

1293
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:43,040
If I was playing games now

1294
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,852
I'd be the loser

1295
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,387
- What are you talking about?
- He's afraid I'm lying

1296
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:50,652
If I was, I'd only be hurting myself

1297
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:58,499
Sit back down

1298
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,634
Sit down

1299
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:07,069
Listen.
I don't care what rank you hold

1300
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:10,201
Since you've been in our village,
we've fed you

1301
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:13,542
looked after your wounds,
cut your hair and beard

1302
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:17,278
In your heart, you know
we've treated you well

1303
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,751
- Very well. What else is there?
- Ask him

1304
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:21,947
He says they've fed you, healed you

1305
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,321
cut your hair
and treated you well, right?

1306
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:34,267
Like members of their own family

1307
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:39,870
Especially Dasan and his pregnant wife.
They've been great

1308
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:45,476
You've treated us like family,
especially Dasan and his wife

1309
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,481
Look, let's not talk about that

1310
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:49,914
Don't talk about that

1311
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,151
What's the second question?

1312
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,222
And the second question?

1313
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,725
You answered it

1314
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,557
before I even asked

1315
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,229
Well

1316
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,898
is there anything else?

1317
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,663
You've answered everything.

1318
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,271
He finally looks happy

1319
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:25,341
The swordsman wasn't one of you

1320
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,017
I could tell from his accent
he was one of those who captured us

1321
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,322
You persuaded him to leave
and saved our lives

1322
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:34,691
I've told him this. We thank you

1323
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,564
It was nothing

1324
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,498
We were talking about the swordsman

1325
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,628
- Nothing to do with you people.
- That's right

1326
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,706
So long as you know that

1327
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,104
That's fine

1328
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,838
Sit back down

1329
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:56,748
Since that's the case,
I'll read this back to you

1330
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,484
If you've no problem with it,
you can sign it

1331
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:03,181
They've got an agreement to sign

1332
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,786
The Japanese Kosaburo Hanaya
arrived in our village at year's end

1333
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:13,630
It was cold. He was frightened

1334
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:18,465
disheveled, and wounded by a bullet

1335
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:21,474
Who brought him here, we do not know

1336
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:26,103
Six months passed.
Winter turned to summer

1337
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:29,672
The villagers were kind and righteous

1338
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:33,884
They did all they could to help --

1339
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:38,281
clothing, sheltering and feeding him
despite the hardship

1340
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:43,189
We've all been through this turmoil.
We'll never forget this experience

1341
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:47,564
Hanaya in gratitude promised us

1342
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,503
two carts of grain as a reward

1343
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:55,508
We happily accepted this offer

1344
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:59,904
Now Hanaya and his translator
return to you

1345
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:04,547
And hereafter,
both sides will live in peace

1346
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:09,913
Signed by the Chinese and the Japanese.,

1347
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:12,292
Captain!

1348
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:16,396
Captain!

1349
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,492
Hanaya is back!

1350
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,764
Captain!

1351
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:23,069
Hanaya is back!

1352
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:31,201
- What's happening?
- Hanaya is back!

1353
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,387
Captain!

1354
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:42,012
Hanaya is back?

1355
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:45,185
Yes. Hanaya is back

1356
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,265
I'm back

1357
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,662
I'm really back!

1358
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,340
I'm back!

1359
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,577
- How come he's still alive?
- What happened to h is uniform?

1360
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,738
Did he get taller?

1361
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,645
Attention!

1362
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:16,724
Captain, sir!
Kosaburo Hanaya

1363
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,316
has returned to the ranks!

1364
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:21,317
Dasan. Look. What a mess

1365
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,615
Oh, no

1366
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:29,392
This is terrible.
Get off. Off. Give me a hand

1367
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,633
Pull 'em apart

1368
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:35,532
- Push.
- He won't budge

1369
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,433
We didn't plan this

1370
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,196
“We didn't plan this. ”

1371
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,076
We didn't tell him to do that

1372
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:45,407
“We didn't tell him to do that. ”

1373
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,676
Fucking hell

1374
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,848
captain-san.
We're so sorry

1375
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,356
Turn around!

1376
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:01,424
-Attention.
- Yes, sir

1377
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,861
- Know why we're beating you?
- No

1378
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:06,559
What? Stupid pig.

1379
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,668
- Now you understand?
- Yes, sir

1380
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,205
Say it. Why are we beating you?

1381
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:20,239
I shouldn't have come back alive

1382
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,012
You think dying would've solved it?

1383
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,641
Yes, but --

1384
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:30,217
Your name's inscribed
in the Yasukuni Shrine

1385
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,682
I've already. informed your father

1386
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:36,525
You're the goddamn hero of the village.
And now you're back, alive

1387
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:39,862
You have lost face for the village
and the Imperial Army

1388
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:44,131
Worse, you've returned
with a herd of Chinese swine

1389
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,868
Bastard

1390
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:51,406
They weren't the ones who captured me.
They saved me

1391
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:55,549
First they captured you,
then the pigs saved you

1392
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:59,814
You know how many died in that battle?
If they didn't ambush us, who did?

1393
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:02,981
I was taken to them
only after I was shot.

1394
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,854
I never meant to surrender. I--

1395
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,361
What are you saying?
Swine

1396
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:13,557
Tell us, were you a prisoner or not?

1397
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,659
Speak

1398
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:18,599
Yes

1399
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,102
I passed out,
and when I a woke

1400
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:25,011
I was tied up in a sack

1401
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,806
Because you passed out,
you think it's all right?

1402
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,985
Couldn't you have committed suicide?

1403
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,611
I had no opportunity!

1404
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,919
Bastard! You need an opportunity
to commit suicide?

1405
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,185
But --

1406
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,825
- You think you deserve to live?
- Move!

1407
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,434
You bastard.
Why aren't you helping?

1408
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:51,200
Feel sorry for him, do you?

1409
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,671
You want to forgive him?

1410
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,607
Hanaya wants to say something

1411
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,375
- Bastard!
- I'm sorry

1412
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:06,042
Truly sorry.
So truly sorry

1413
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,428
And that makes everything all right?

1414
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:31,376
Let him speak.
Soon they'll have you on the rack

1415
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:34,107
with chili water up your nose.
Scared?

1416
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,844
Get a grip on yourself

1417
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:40,011
What are you scared of?
Everyone's here

1418
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:43,147
A chopped-off head leaves a big scar.
Blame it all on me

1419
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,088
You can say I captured the Jap

1420
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:48,357
If we were scared,
would we be here?

1421
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,430
We're just hanging around.
Why can't we talk?

1422
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,591
I thought everything was fine

1423
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,467
until your donkey started acting up.
He's got no sense of timing

1424
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:00,040
He could have chosen
another horse besides the Jap's

1425
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:01,506
Please forgive me

1426
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:03,369
Please forgive me

1427
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,679
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry

1428
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,806
Hanaya,
let me read this letter to you

1429
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:09,883
Yes, sir

1430
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,652
The son of the Hanayas'
is a great hero

1431
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:17,214
Each time I pass by their door,
I lower my head in shame

1432
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:19,793
Hanaya is the pride of our village

1433
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:22,419
Son. Kill more Chinese pigs
for your father

1434
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:27,194
Serve the emperor well.
Solemnly yours --

1435
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,997
San. You kept Hanaya
locked up for six months

1436
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,072
couldn't they do the same to us?

1437
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:35,068
Why do you always think the worst?

1438
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:37,804
You call that locked up?
I call it looking after them

1439
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:41,507
Besides, we didn't capture him.
He wasn't our prisoner

1440
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,584
But now we're locked up here

1441
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:47,085
with nothing to eat or drink.
So aren't we the prisoners now?

1442
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:48,678
Prisoners?

1443
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,387
Don't you have two legs?
You came here yourself

1444
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:56,259
If you're a prisoner,
you're your own prisoner

1445
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:59,265
Dad.
How can you sleep?

1446
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,392
- This is no good. Move.
- San

1447
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:03,299
I've got something to say
to your captain-san

1448
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:04,735
Get back!

1449
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:06,568
- I've got something to say --
- Get back!

1450
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,908
- I've got --
- Get back!

1451
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,001
- But I must talk to him.
- Get back!

1452
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:14,609
Move again and I'll kill you

1453
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,574
Then --

1454
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:22,748
Kosaburo Hanaya

1455
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:26,225
On August 15, 1945

1456
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,318
Zixuan Zhao, Dasan Ma

1457
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:31,398
Kosaburo Hanaya, Hanchen Dong,
solemnly agreed to these terms.

1458
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,967
- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir

1459
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:46,670
You groveled enough.
Why not mention this as well?

1460
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:49,276
I was about to

1461
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:50,941
- Bastard.
- Shut up

1462
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:54,180
Captain,
you don't have to honor the agreement

1463
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,256
Shut up! Fool!

1464
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,222
Hanaya left h is fingerprint

1465
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,230
Unlike the Chinese,
the Japanese are honorable people

1466
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:07,099
Get out!

1467
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:08,463
Yes, sir

1468
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:13,797
- I humbly take my leave.
- Get out

1469
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,575
- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir

1470
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:24,277
You've signed an agreement

1471
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,320
The Imperial Army honors
its pledges.

1472
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,550
I have no choice
but to carry this through

1473
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:36,028
Hold on. In my experience,
the Chinese are unreliable mongrels

1474
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,598
If they say east, think west

1475
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:43,466
I'm sure it's not as simple as it seems.
There must be someone behind this

1476
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,869
Shut up. Bastard

1477
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,669
Hanaya. Standup

1478
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:01,150
This matter--

1479
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,155
I'll do this for you

1480
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:08,392
All right?

1481
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:11,298
Yes, sir

1482
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:12,558
Attention!

1483
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,300
Who signed this agreement?

1484
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:29,874
What, afraid to admit you signed?

1485
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:33,253
I signed

1486
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:36,883
Good. Come here

1487
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:45,795
Dasan Ma

1488
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:48,993
Dasan Ma

1489
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:51,970
Good.
Here, come

What is it, Inoue?

1498

Urgent phone call

From Western Fortress Town

1501
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,408
They haven't called in
over a month

1502
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,675
They must have a mission for us

1503
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:37,307
Charge!

1504

Old Uncle here

1507
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,491
It's me, Dasan

1508
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:58,003
- Is that San?
- Yeah

1509
01:37:58,539 --> 01:37:59,631
What's up?

1510
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,607
The grain will be there tonight

1511
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:06,137
It'll arrive by dusk

1512
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:09,307
- What?
- Get everyone together

1513
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,475
Everyone must be there

1514
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,580
Do you understand me?

1515
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:17,657
- What?
- can you hear me?

1516
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:20,352
Huh? What?

1517
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:24,261
I said, do you understand me?

1518
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,322
I hear you

1519
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,391
I hear you

1520
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,472
Gather everyone together

1521
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:34,905
- Right?
- Right

1522
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,306
San

1523
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,538
- Have a safe journey.
- I will

1524
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:41,607
Take care

1525
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:42,977
Yeah

1526
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,812
I'm finished

1527
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:49,917
Yes, we know

1528
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:53,121
Captain.
Lieutenant Nonomura would like a word

1529
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:57,424
Hello?

1530
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:02,664
Yes, organize a celebration
with the navy and infantry

1531
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:07,436
He's so far away. But he sounded like
he was in the next room

1532
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,600
Wasn't that amazing?
It's no wonder --

1533
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:13,045
What are you talking about?

1534
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:15,945
He says the captain is
the kindest of men

1535
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:18,484
and the Imperial Army has
the finest of things

1536
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,822
Hanaya stayed with you
for six months

1537
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:28,123
He consumed much food
and put you out

1538
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:29,959
So

1539
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,532
I will give you
the two carts of grain.

1540
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:36,899
and add four carts as a reward.
Six in all. How's that? Translate

1541
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,330
The captain said,
because of the grain eaten by Hanaya

1542
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:43,410
he will add four carts as a reward.
Six in all. How's that?

1543
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:46,604
- Six carts of grain?
- Thank the captain-san

1544
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:48,807
I'm speechless

1545
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,542
What's he saying?

1546
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:55,611
His gratitude knows no bounds.
He wishes to kowtow before you

1547
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,694
All right. Load the carts.
Get their people together. Hurry up

1548
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:04,559
Quickly, load the carts,
before the Japs change their mind

1549
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:06,860
- Load the carts? Great.
- come back

1550
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:10,394
- You've got to bow to the captain-san.
- captain-san

1551
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:32,822
- Well, San?
- What happened?

1552
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:39,164
You're going on the rack
with chili water up your nose

1553
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:44,167
They've given us the two carts
pl us four more. Six in all

1554
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:46,501
That's wonderful!

1555
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:47,596
Let's load ‘em up

1556
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,836
You can slap me if you like

1557
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,550
Go right, Captain

1558
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,706
can you take this for me?

1559
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:30,511
I want to pick up Yu'er
and collect a few others as well

1560
01:41:30,617 --> 01:41:32,175
Won't the old man get angry?

1561
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:35,449
Don't tell him. Let him brood.
Forget him

1562
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:36,853
Okay

1563
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:04,574
Long live the emperor!

1564
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:34,737
Company, attention

1565
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:40,386
- Nonomura at your service.
- Sakatsuka at yours

1566
01:42:49,429 --> 01:42:52,262
Old Uncle!

1567
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,759
We're back!

1568
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:56,961
Right turn!

1569
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:59,862
We've got the grain!

1570
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,583
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1571
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:16,987
You're my granddad,
I'm your son

1572
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,892
Where's my stool?
Rabbit-fucker

1573
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:22,689
Eat up

1574
01:43:23,463 --> 01:43:25,556
We walk the straight
and narrow path

1575
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:28,226
A healthy foot doesn't fear
a twisted shoe

1576
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:30,770
Eat, drink and be merry

1577
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:38,140
Lieutenant Nonomura,
strike up the band

1578
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:41,947
I want to say a few words.
Can they play the army theme?

1579
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:45,450
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
The naval tune is the only one we know

1580
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:48,146
We're just navy reserves, you see

1581
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:50,882
Music is our little hobby

1582
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:55,056
Then play your navy song

1583
01:43:56,129 --> 01:43:57,596
You don't mind?

1584
01:43:59,866 --> 01:44:01,766
Attention!

1585
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,930
Straighten up, Horie

1586
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:13,540
- Well?
- Excellent

1587
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:14,614
Thank you

1588
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,945
How is it? Good?

01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:57,640
and sung a song

1616

The captain praises your singing

1655
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:52,553
Your mother's a real tease

1656
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:55,423
If there are more songs like this,
there'll be trouble

1657
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,826
Pity they're all sung in chorus

1658
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,533
We sing ours individually

1659
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:08,033
Why don't you sing one yourself,
to entertain us?

1660
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:12,942
All right

1661
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:18,845
Kosaburo Hanaya,
give these people a song

1662
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,450
Hanaya, standup

1663
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,789
Were you speaking Chinese just now?
Let's hear it.

1664
01:49:27,193 --> 01:49:28,751
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1665
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:29,624
And?

1666
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:33,165
You're my granddad,
I'm your son

1667
01:49:33,266 --> 01:49:34,597
Translate, Dong

1668
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,635
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law

1669
01:49:36,736 --> 01:49:39,034
You're my granddad,
I'm your son

1670
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:46,473
Give me a gun

1671
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:57,516
Kosaburo Hanaya
is the scum of the Imperial Army

1672
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:01,991
I invite you to shoot him

1673
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:03,626
with this gun

1674
01:50:04,397 --> 01:50:07,833
for our drinking entertainment

1675
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:10,463
Well? Who'll do it?

1676
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:14,165
Hanaya represents the scum of the army.
The captain invites you to shoot him

1677
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:16,174
For our drinking entertainment.
Any takers?

1678
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:20,009
How can he be scum?

1679
01:50:20,914 --> 01:50:24,042
For six months you lived
under Nonomura's blockhouse

1680
01:50:26,419 --> 01:50:27,886
Is that true?

1681
01:50:27,988 --> 01:50:29,888
It's no small amount of time

1682
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:32,718
Why didn't you contact Nonomura?

1683
01:50:32,826 --> 01:50:35,818
If he was on the h ill,
don't tell me he couldn't see you

1684
01:50:35,929 --> 01:50:38,124
We had no opportunity

1685
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:39,960
What do you mean?

1686
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:43,160
- We were locked up in the cellar.
- I didn't ask you

1687
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:45,464
Hanchen Dong spoke the truth

1688
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:47,165
What?

1689
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:50,071
You didn't do too badly

1690
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:53,377
So

1691
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:56,779
besides learning some Chinese,
what else did you do?

1692
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:05,857
It's only on account of your promise
that I'm feeding these mongrels

1693
01:51:06,559 --> 01:51:08,527
So that explains it

1694
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:14,757
So, asking them to kill you now

1695
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:18,530
is rather appropriate, isn't it?

1696
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:28,105
Come on.
Execute him, why don't you?

1697
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:30,776
come on, everyone, shoot him

1698
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:43,685
If you don't

1699
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:47,295
then I take it you forgive him?

1700
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:49,835
If you don't,
that means you forgive him

1701
01:52:01,581 --> 01:52:03,742
Turtle-fucker!

1702
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:07,377
Nonomura. A favor

1703
01:52:07,487 --> 01:52:10,217
Can we hear the whole tune
from the top?

1704
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:13,653
Yes, sir

1705
01:52:21,968 --> 01:52:24,493
This is our first visit here

1706
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:30,468
We'd never heard of Rack-Armor Terrace.
It means “put down weapons. ”

1707
01:52:30,977 --> 01:52:34,378
The story goes, a long time ago

1708
01:52:34,481 --> 01:52:38,577
a famous general retired from battle
and came here to live an ordinary life

1709
01:52:38,685 --> 01:52:41,518
The Chinese say to “rack one's armor”

1710
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:44,615
and return to the fields

1711
01:52:44,724 --> 01:52:47,784
is an extreme form of virtue

1712
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:50,624
I wish to express my deep respect

1713
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:55,500
Although the Japanese Army
is fighting in China

1714
01:52:56,035 --> 01:52:58,799
this won't go on forever

1715
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:04,106
One day. I too will rack my armor.

1716
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:08,771
And yet

1717
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:13,316
in a place that so dislikes warfare

1718
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,352
a Japanese soldier
of the likes of Hanaya

1719
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:18,890
was kid napped and held captive

1720
01:53:19,259 --> 01:53:22,854
It appears Rack-Armor Terrace

1721
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:26,490
doesn't deserve its name

1722
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:31,498
And you are not
as wise as your fore fathers

1723
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:47,243
I've given you your grain

1724
01:53:47,987 --> 01:53:49,818
I've fulfilled my end of the bargain

1725
01:53:53,927 --> 01:53:56,327
But I have a question for you

1726
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:03,363
Who was it
who brought this scum here?

1727
01:54:15,048 --> 01:54:18,040
I don't know.
You have to ask Hanaya

1728
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:23,153
- Hanaya, answer the question.
- I really don't know

1729
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:27,891
Look. Even he doesn't know.
How could I answer?

1730
01:54:27,994 --> 01:54:29,962
Why not drop it?

1731
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:32,896
He's been returned.
Isn't that the end of it?

1732
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:38,334
Well, where's Dasan Ma gone?

1733
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:41,006
To fetch Yu'er

1734
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:47,411
Yu'er?
How many men is she bringing?

1735
01:54:47,513 --> 01:54:49,071
How many guns?

1736
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:53,109
She's pregnant.
She's staying at her mother's

1737
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:56,711
As for people, probably two or three.
But no guns

1738
01:54:57,423 --> 01:55:01,189
They'll be back soon. We're waiting
for him to divide the grain

1739
01:55:07,367 --> 01:55:10,302
Divide the grain? Surely not

1740
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:13,495
He's gone to get the men

1741
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:16,370
who captured Hanaya

1742
01:55:18,511 --> 01:55:22,277
It looks like he's scared you.
Don't be afraid

1743
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:24,009
He'll be back soon. You'll see

1744
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,681
You think I'm afraid?

1745
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:31,816
course you are.
You've got your guns out

1746
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:33,950
If that's not fear, what is it?

1747
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:37,120
Look at me.
I'm eating and drinking

1748
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:40,290
I'm not worried about anything.
Just relax

1749
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:45,170
Bastard!

1750
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:48,099
Why all the cursing?
I understand bakayaro

1751
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:49,970
How can you say that?

1752
01:55:52,078 --> 01:55:53,807
You fucking --

1753
01:55:53,913 --> 01:55:54,880
Li u Wang!

1754
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:00,315
Don't let anyone get away

1755
01:56:02,322 --> 01:56:04,722
Don't stop. Keep playing

1756
01:56:06,559 --> 01:56:09,027
Bastards! Surround them!

1757
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:21,396
Don't! Don't go!

1758
01:56:22,742 --> 01:56:26,701
Mongrel.
We should've killed you long ago

1759
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,281
You've got the heart of a wolf

1760
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,850
- Translate.
- We should've killed you long ago

1761
01:56:32,952 --> 01:56:34,385
New soldiers

1762
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,781
-A rare opportunity
- Yes, sir

1763
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:46,855
Pull it out yourself

1764
01:56:51,871 --> 01:56:53,930
Harder. Twist it

1765
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:06,749
Who was it who brought
this scum here?

1766
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,445
Where's Dasan Ma?

1767
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:12,519
The baby's nearly due.
We'll get another share of the grain

1768
01:57:12,992 --> 01:57:15,017
and I'll marry you

1769
01:57:15,128 --> 01:57:19,121
Turtle-fucker!
I'll kill you, Jap turtle-fucker!

1770
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:24,529
Ma!

1771
01:57:34,514 --> 01:57:36,744
Get up. Standup

1772
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:52,262
Japanese inside the Great Wall

1773
01:57:54,267 --> 01:57:56,132
Let go. Go away

1774
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:00,771
Nonomura.
You've been with them for too long

1775
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:02,500
You're getting too close to them --

1776
01:58:02,608 --> 01:58:05,873
like an auntie to these b rats

1777
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:10,349
- Brat!
-Japanese inside the Great Wall

1778
01:58:32,338 --> 01:58:34,067
Grab him!

1779
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:37,069
You bastard!

1780
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,311
Drag the old bastard over!

1781
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:45,179
I'll throttle you, turtle-fucker!

1782
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:46,808
Let go, you old swine!

1783
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:48,978
You'd dare strangle
an Imperial Army soldier?

1784
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,055
Hold him!

1785
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:57,387
How come it's not cutting through?
Let me try

1786
01:59:00,299 --> 01:59:03,029
Stop dicking around! Bastard!

1787
01:59:03,503 --> 01:59:05,266
Let me do it. Move

1788
01:59:18,117 --> 01:59:19,414
Throw him on the fire

1789
01:59:20,853 --> 01:59:24,380
Die, you old mongrel!

1790
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:28,452
Ma!

1791
01:59:28,561 --> 01:59:32,224
Swine.
You wanna die? I'll help you.

1792
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:35,594
Hurry! Come on!

1793
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:39,663
Throw him in! Hurry!
You haven't seen me rest, have you?

1794
01:59:46,412 --> 01:59:48,607
Let's burn the grain and the village!

1795
01:59:48,948 --> 01:59:51,712
Charge! Advance!

1796
02:00:04,764 --> 02:00:08,063
Long live the emperor!

1797
02:00:09,168 --> 02:00:10,863
No need for you to die

1798
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:15,066
The emperor has made a proclamation

1799
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:18,240
The Imperial Army

1800
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:21,673
has racked its armor

1801
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:27,713
But we weren't defeated
on the battlefield

1802
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:33,790
Such a pity.
On account of this imperial order

1803
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:37,027
we have to stop fighting

1804
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:41,194
The war situation is no longer

1805
02:00:41,867 --> 02:00:44,392
to Japan's advantage

1806
02:00:44,503 --> 02:00:48,997
The enemy has employed
a new, cruel bomb

1807
02:00:49,475 --> 02:00:54,242
which has taken
a toll of many innocent lives

1808
02:00:55,248 --> 02:01:00,242
and has an incalculable
destructive power

1809
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:04,852
Should we continue to fight

1810
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:09,819
not only would the Japanese nation
be obliterated

1811
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:14,231
but human civilization
would be extinguished

1812
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:17,468
Such being the case

1813
02:01:18,104 --> 02:01:20,868
how are we to save our subjects

1814
02:01:20,973 --> 02:01:23,942
and atone before the spirits
of our ancestors?

1815
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:27,470
This is why we accepted

1816
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:32,581
the joint declaration of the powers

1817
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:45,160

02:08:12,451 --> 02:08:14,419
Dasan Ma!

02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,545
What are you doing?

1906
02:08:16,655 --> 02:08:17,622
Turtle-fucker!

1907
02:08:24,997 --> 02:08:27,261

Thank you, Chinese Army.
Thank you

1910
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,187
The Japanese have surrendered.
The war is over

1911
02:08:56,295 --> 02:08:58,126
Peace has come at last

1912
02:08:58,897 --> 02:08:59,989
Yet in the last few days

1913
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:04,695
one man has violated the agreement
which Generalissimo Chiang

1914
02:09:04,803 --> 02:09:09,069
President Truman,
Prime Minister Churchill and Stalin

1915
02:09:09,174 --> 02:09:13,270
in the interest of world peace,
signed at Potsdam

1916
02:09:13,378 --> 02:09:17,007
thus disturbing the social order
and terrorizing people

1917
02:09:17,416 --> 02:09:20,351
That person is Dasan Ma,
who you see before you

1918
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:24,852
Perhaps some will say
Dasan Ma only killed Jap devils,

1919
02:09:24,957 --> 02:09:27,858
and call it “resistance.,,
But what is ”resistance,,?

1920
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:31,953
Battles fought with Japanese troops,
the struggle against invasion

1921
02:09:32,331 --> 02:09:34,128
Those are acts of resistance

1922
02:09:34,233 --> 02:09:39,170
But Dasan Ma's wanton slaughter of POWs
who had lost the will to resist

1923
02:09:39,271 --> 02:09:40,898
was a false resistance

1924
02:09:42,307 --> 02:09:45,071
Perhaps some will argue
that such profound hatred

1925
02:09:45,177 --> 02:09:47,111
was the result of Japanese atrocities

1926
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:52,510
Who of our 400 mill ion com patriots
doesn't hate the Japanese?

1927
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:57,180
My own parents
were killed by Japanese bombs

1928
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:58,881
My left leg

1929
02:10:01,894 --> 02:10:04,863
was shattered in the final battle

1930
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:10,861
Who could be more motivated to kill
former Japanese soldiers?

1931
02:10:10,969 --> 02:10:14,336
Who has the best reason for revenge?

1932
02:10:14,706 --> 02:10:16,367
Me. Major Gao

1933
02:10:17,142 --> 02:10:20,134
And who is most constrained
from such action?

1934
02:10:20,245 --> 02:10:21,974
Me. Major Gao

1935
02:10:22,514 --> 02:10:25,347
Because I am a soldier,
I must follow orders

1936
02:10:26,151 --> 02:10:27,914
I take this opportunity

1937
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:32,320
to reissue this warning:
only Nationalist soldiers

1938
02:10:32,424 --> 02:10:35,052
can legally accept the surrender
of Japanese troops

1939
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:40,356
War hasn't only brought
catastrophe to china

1940
02:10:40,899 --> 02:10:43,561
but to the people of Japan as well

1941
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,432
Are they not human too?

1942
02:10:46,471 --> 02:10:48,530
I ask you.
Who among you

1943
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:53,134
would tolerate
to see your husband's head chopped off?

1944
02:10:53,745 --> 02:10:54,803
Anyone?

1945
02:10:54,913 --> 02:10:55,880
No one!

1946
02:10:55,981 --> 02:10:58,415
I ask you too.
Who among you

1947
02:10:58,517 --> 02:11:02,112
would wish to see your wife,
on her way to buy a bolt of cloth

1948
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:04,519
have her hand cut off?
Anyone?

1949
02:11:04,623 --> 02:11:05,715
No one!

1950
02:11:06,258 --> 02:11:09,250
Dasan Ma. Do you have
anything to say for yourself?

1951
02:11:10,095 --> 02:11:11,824
Is there anything you can say?

1952
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:27,510
Gag him

1953
02:11:29,047 --> 02:11:30,071
Listen, everyone

1954
02:11:30,182 --> 02:11:31,809
Ever heard a cry to heaven,,?

1955
02:11:31,917 --> 02:11:34,511
- He is braying like a mule.
- That's a cry to heaven.,

1956
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:38,021
What distinguishes man from a beast?

1957
02:11:38,523 --> 02:11:41,458
You don't deserve
to be called Chinese

1958
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:43,619
You don't even deserve
to be called human

1959
02:11:44,096 --> 02:11:48,396
How can a Chinese soldier sully
his hands with the blood of such scum?

1960
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,524
Inokichi Sakatsuka

1961
02:11:50,068 --> 02:11:51,194
Inokichi Sakatsuka

1962
02:12:06,551 --> 02:12:07,813
Attention!

1963
02:12:12,157 --> 02:12:13,124
I nokichi Sakatsuka

1964
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:19,126
I order you
to execute Dasan Ma

1965
02:12:19,598 --> 02:12:20,565
Shoot him

1966
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:23,328
He orders you to carry out
the execution

1967
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,164
Really?

1968
02:12:27,272 --> 02:12:28,398
That's what he said

1969
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:31,570
What?
You dare to disobey my command?

1970
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:37,305
We've put down our weapons.
We cannot use firearms

1971
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:41,446
I could obey your order,
using a Japanese sword

1972
02:12:41,553 --> 02:12:43,214
It's our customary weapon

1973
02:12:43,755 --> 02:12:46,383
Translate that bit
about the sword accurately

1974
02:12:48,694 --> 02:12:51,925
Reporting to Major Gao:
We've al ready handed in our firearms

1975
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:54,021
We're not permitted
to use them anyway

1976
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:57,727
However,
we must obey your order

1977
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:00,964
The Japanese warrior always
carries a sword

1978
02:13:01,406 --> 02:13:03,670
could he use a sword?

1979
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:06,004
What a pain.
Okay, give him a sword

1980
02:13:06,111 --> 02:13:08,636
- What a good story this is.
- Indeed

1981
02:13:08,747 --> 02:13:11,011
We'll write a great skit about this

1982
02:13:23,095 --> 02:13:24,562
Kosaburo Hanaya

1983
02:13:31,536 --> 02:13:32,833
Hanaya

1984
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:38,635
Reporting to Major Gao:

1985
02:14:38,737 --> 02:14:40,602
The preparations are complete

1986
02:14:40,705 --> 02:14:42,696
Please issue the go-ahead

1987
02:14:42,808 --> 02:14:44,469
The preparations are complete

1988
02:14:44,576 --> 02:14:46,407
Please issue the go-ahead

1989
02:14:46,878 --> 02:14:48,641
- Do it!
- Yes, sir!
