1
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,050
We've been living peacefully outside the border

2
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:07,589
Why must we come back here?

3
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:10,438
lt's been 10 years. Have you come back for her ?!

4
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:16,743
No. The reason for my return is that, l hear...

5
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,174
the Plum Blossom Bandit has reappeared

6
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,308
Yes, what's that got to do with us?

7
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,039
Twenty years ago, the Plum Blossom Bandit

8
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:26,692
was a well known master in the martial world

9
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,382
He has harmed a lot of people

10
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,436
l wanted to look for him 10 years ago

11
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,493
He just vanished suddenly

12
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:39,206
l think he might want to look me up now

13
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,127
lnspite of knowing all this...

14
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:42,827
then what are you doing back?

15
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:48,357
He must have gone to look for me at my old house

16
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,112
Are you worried that he might hurt your cousin?

17
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,908
lf you love her so much...

18
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,925
Why did you let her marry Long Xiaoyun?

19
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,432
l know that he once saved your life

20
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:03,322
But l've never heard of anyone who would...

21
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,512
give up his fiancee and property for gratitude

22
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:09,130
That happened ten years ago

23
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:14,143
There's no need to bring it up

24
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,608
Aren't you cold? You want a sip of wine?

25
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:11,968
Are you deaf?

26
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:18,122
So you're not deaf. Have a sip

27
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,246
l can't afford it

28
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,298
Don't worry, it's my treat

29
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,646
l don't want to take things from others

30
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:28,943
l don't want to drink wine which l didn't buy

31
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:32,396
Have l made myself clear?

32
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:34,823
Yes, quite

33
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:35,874
Then please leave

34
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,199
l will

35
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:41,468
Say, when you can afford it...

36
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,757
will you treat me to a drink?

37
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,231
Certainly

38
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:10,107
Sit down please

39
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,908
Over there

40
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:24,821
Your wine, young master

41
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:36,787
There're a few from the Golden Lion Escort Agency

42
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,562
They're escorting something from out of town

43
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,596
Number two

44
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,400
Do you remember that time we came across

45
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:45,173
... the Four Tigers of Tai Xing?

46
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,303
How can l forget? That day they tried

47
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,735
... to steal from you

48
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,312
But they are no match for you

49
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:10,959
So you're 'Sudden Wind Sword' Zhuge Lei?

50
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:13,428
May l ask your names? Sorry l didn't recognize

51
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:17,813
You aren't worthy of knowing our names

52
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:20,519
Just leave what you are escorting

53
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,296
... and we'll spare your life

54
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:23,964
Put down your swords

55
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,609
And we'll let you live

56
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:03,113
Are you 'The Black and White Snake?''

57
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:07,175
Well, at least you've heard of us !

58
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,070
Since the two want this package

59
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:11,633
Go on, take it

60
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,434
Looks like there's another grand master here

61
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,041
We've almost missed you

62
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:27,634
lf you're interested in this package

63
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,082
And if you can defeat us;

64
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:33,139
Not only we'll give this to you

65
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,836
We're willing to give you our heads

66
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,211
Your heads are worth nothing

67
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:46,495
Did you say that?

68
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:47,674
Yes

69
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:52,516
lt's a pity mine is worthless

70
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,895
lt's too much, l just want 50 taels

71
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,679
Fine, if you can kill me...

72
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:00,967
l'll give you 50 taels

73
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,076
My money !

74
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:25,570
Take it, take all of it

75
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,142
So, it's you !

76
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,594
l can afford to buy you a drink now

77
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:14,380
With pleasure

78
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,230
l look for good drinking company

79
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,547
... and a good place

80
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,949
l hate crowds

81
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:33,341
Please

82
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,788
Judging from the awe they had in their eyes...

83
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:43,258
you seem like someone well known

84
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:50,357
lt's not a good thing to be famous

85
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,279
My name is Li Xunhuan, and yourself ?

86
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,183
Ah Fei

87
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,017
Ah Fei ?

88
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,231
Right

89
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:59,821
l'm an orphan who grew up in the wilderness

90
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,228
l envy the birds flying in the sky

91
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,762
Hence my name !

92
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,128
Strange name indeed. Cheers

93
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,388
You shouldn't be drinking while coughing

94
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,812
Yes, l shouldn't touch any alcohol

95
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,412
Then why do you drink?

96
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,648
Do you have a sad past?

97
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:29,909
Have l asked anything you don't want to answer?

98
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,198
No

99
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,987
Then why did you ask?

100
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:36,799
Okay, l won't

101
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:40,039
Even if you want to ask, it'll have to wait

102
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,295
We've got company

103
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:47,061
Yes, one on the tree on the left

104
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,169
Four at the temple ruins

105
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,318
One behind the tree

106
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:33,058
Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss! So overrated

107
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,925
Give up the package

108
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,697
And we'll leave you alone

109
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:52,752
l've got the package

110
00:12:56,587 --> 00:13:00,513
Let's have another drink before l head off

111
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,661
Go! Chase...

112
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,359
Wait for me here

113
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,290
Who are you?

114
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:14,824
Li Xunhuan

115
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,432
Finally you are here

116
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,642
You've been waiting for me?

117
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,939
A hero called Ah fey has killed many

118
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,368
except one; he told me to keep an eye on him

119
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,688
And wait for you

120
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:23,310
Where's the person?

121
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,436
Here

122
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:33,581
What are you doing here?

123
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:37,024
This is the only house around

124
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,947
After l've got the package

125
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,110
... l wanted to rest here for a night

126
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,901
Who'd have known that your young friend's here !

127
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,266
Have some tea

128
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,736
Thanks

129
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,306
Are you alright, sir?

130
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,841
l'm not used to drinking tea

131
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:08,446
Then have some wine

132
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:09,276
-Do you have any? -Yes

133
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:09,767
Great

134
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,906
Just a minute

135
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:14,079
l'll give you the package

136
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,613
Please let me go

137
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,912
What's inside the package?

138
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:21,279
Why are so many after it?

139
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,230
You honestly don't know?

140
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,148
Now that the Plum Flower Bandit reappeared

141
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:27,815
lnside the package

142
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:29,460
is the unique

143
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,784
Gold Threaded Vest. lt's like an armour

144
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,477
No wonder !

145
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,246
Wine, sir

146
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,410
Thanks

147
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,121
Please let me go

148
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:44,140
l'll give you everything

149
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,601
l've an old grandmother

150
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,857
Three children

151
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,475
A lot of people are after this package

152
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,088
So are you

153
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:18,166
l kept my mouth shut before you had your tea

154
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,371
Now that you've had a sip of poison tea

155
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:24,014
... at the most l can wait here one more hour

156
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,173
You'll die of poisoning

157
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:29,164
l wasn't a part of it

158
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,049
Who are you?

159
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,766
Maybe you should know...

160
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,816
who killed you !

161
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,161
What a pretty girl

162
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:45,235
l'd watch out should l see you again

163
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,151
Do you think you'll see me again?

164
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,527
Of course, you know the tea is poisoned

165
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,144
But you didn't know that when l was coughing

166
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,468
... l spit out the tea

167
00:16:58,461 --> 00:16:59,397
Come on

168
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,716
lmpressive !

169
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,692
Don't fight them. lf you use your energy

170
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:55,925
... the poison inside you will circulate faster

171
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:02,682
The girl forced me into poisoning the tea

172
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:08,907
But l was responsible for poisoning the wine

173
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,786
The wine too?

174
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,700
Couldn't you taste it?

175
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,174
You are ...

176
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:19,623
One of the Seven lncredible Men

177
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:24,041
The mean and shameless one ... Hua Feng

178
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,001
l see

179
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,257
Not anymore

180
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:32,491
Now l'm the richest man in the martial arts world

181
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:35,869
For l own the Gold Threaded Vest

182
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,512
You ... you ...

183
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,920
lt's called, Fisherman gains when snipe & clam fight

184
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,459
You ... you ...

185
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:58,275
Master

186
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,865
Chuanjia

187
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,908
Master

188
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:04,570
Chuanjia

189
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,657
Master

190
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:06,664
Hurry, go after him

191
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:07,710
Sure

192
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:18,659
He is over there

193
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,890
Dead !

194
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:30,877
Maybe he's got the antidote

195
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,099
Be careful

196
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,196
He could have other poisonous weapons

197
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,312
Don't scratch yourself

198
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,255
l know

199
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,424
Nothing at all

200
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,139
l knew it

201
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,914
l'm never that lucky

202
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:57,178
Excellent wine

203
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,543
Where do you think you're going?

204
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,292
Despite charging us, you didn't treat the patient

205
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,388
What'd you mean by coming here and drinking wine ?

206
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,632
Haven't you heard

207
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,331
... that l've a habit ?

208
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,682
What habit?

209
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:27,135
l don't treat patients when l drink

210
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:30,582
Damn it, l'll kill you

211
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:36,182
l wouldn't treat the patient, if you want to kill me

212
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,286
Let's talk this over

213
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:41,713
No one needs to get hurt

214
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,734
Mind your own business

215
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,294
Don't run

216
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:54,904
Don't run

217
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,398
Don't run

218
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:01,027
Odd indeed that the one who is telling us not to run

219
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:06,341
... is instead running away himself !

220
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:14,239
Do you now know who l am?

221
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:17,414
Sorry, may l know your name?

222
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:19,355
ln that case...

223
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,731
You save me not because you wanted my cure

224
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,376
Why do we need your help to cure us?

225
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,361
Your master's poisoned by my Cold Chicken powder

226
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,002
l'm the only one who can cure him

227
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,124
No one else can

228
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,288
Someone stole the powder from me a year ago

229
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,102
And now you've been poisoned

230
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,283
Come on,

231
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:50,705
Nothing is better than drinking to death

232
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:54,015
Let's have a drink first

233
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:56,447
Mr. Mei, you said you'll cure my master

234
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,182
Why are you drinking?

235
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:04,478
Why should trivial matters such as life and death

236
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:06,291
... get in the way of drinking?

237
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:11,611
lf you don't give me some wine, l won't help

238
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:20,517
Master

239
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:22,643
Come on

240
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:28,140
You know that our master...

241
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,850
can only live for two more hours?

242
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,434
Why aren't you doing anything?

243
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:40,981
l wouldn't be Mei Er...

244
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:43,202
if you know when l've cured you

245
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:46,307
l've already cured him

246
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:59,390
The wine is the antidote

247
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,860
Thank you, doctor

248
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,923
What are you doing?

249
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,739
What are you doing here?

250
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,211
l'm Tian Qi

251
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:14,386
Please excuse my two friends

252
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,400
l'm here to apologize for them

253
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:20,088
Sounds good

254
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,708
Someone's hurt by the Plum Blossom Bandit

255
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,733
Could you treat him first?

256
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,456
ls he badly injured ?

257
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:33,555
A minor wound on his shoulders

258
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,066
ls that it? Then l don't have to go personally

259
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:40,059
Just take the medicine. Where is he ?

260
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,413
Xingyun Manor

261
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:42,522
Who's the injured person?

262
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,620
Master Long Xiaoyun

263
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,383
Xunhuan

264
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:03,263
Yes, it's me

265
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:07,754
You're really here

266
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,655
l brought some medicine from Mei Er for you

267
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:17,392
Plum Blossom Bandit has resurfaced !

268
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,604
Right, he's now in Baoding City

269
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,856
He has injured many

270
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,561
Where did it all take place ?

271
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,200
My back garden. The Plum...

272
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,885
Blossom Forest in front of Cold Fragrance Chamber

273
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,629
Why there?

274
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:38,161
Because Lin Xianer lives there

275
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,931
Who's Lin Xianer?

276
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:45,538
The number one beauty of martial arts world

277
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,699
Do you have any idea...

278
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:51,350
how many have fallen head over heels for her?

279
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:57,781
What's her connection to you, Brother Long?

280
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:00,039
Why's she living in the Cold Fragrance Chamber?

281
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:02,724
Let me fill you in the details

282
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,194
l heard that Miss Lin's father...

283
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,936
was killed by the Plum Blossom Bandit

284
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:11,658
She has announced that...

285
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:13,851
she'll marry whoever kills the Plum Blossom Bandit

286
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,020
... regardless of age, status and wealth

287
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,547
She'll marry that person

288
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,885
She's going to meet with a group of heroes

289
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,585
... here today

290
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:27,004
Hence she has been putting up at the chamber

291
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:29,441
Master Long

292
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,606
Master Gongsun and many heroes

293
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:32,992
... have arrived

294
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,728
lf it weren't for Lin Xianer's beauty...

295
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,088
l doubt so many important guests will show up

296
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,825
Even if it were a great feast

297
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:45,522
Clean up the guest rooms in the East Chamber

298
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,493
Yes

299
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:51,674
You must be tired after yourjourney

300
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:53,802
Take a rest in the guest room

301
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:57,028
Then l'll introduce you to everyone

302
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,119
lt's time of the red plum season

303
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:11,506
Wonder how plum blossoms are like at the pavilion !

304
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,619
Fallen plums like the snow...

305
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:04,290
lt's been 10 years. Wonder how the plum blossoms are

306
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:15,875
You're back

307
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,945
10 years. You're still drinking as you were

308
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:36,012
Ten years seems like a long time, but it passed by

309
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,954
lf l don't drink, life seems like such a burden !

310
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:48,928
Who told you to do so?

311
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:51,463
Myself

312
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:54,179
Why?

313
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,297
Because l owe my life to someone

314
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:03,148
To be benevolent to your savior you feigned idiocy

315
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:08,686
You got drunk all the time, frequented the brothels

316
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:14,074
Yes, l was hoping you'd give up on me

317
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,684
... and marry Long Xiaoyun

318
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:20,371
Do you think l'd be happy?

319
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:26,599
After you've left

320
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:29,419
l found out the truth

321
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:33,775
l wanted to kill myself

322
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:37,491
And then l thought...

323
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:39,194
l'd better stay alive

324
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:46,364
Because there's a chance we'll see each other again

325
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,347
Too bad, things have changed now

326
00:28:54,374 --> 00:29:03,485
The past is in the past

327
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:17,266
Lady Lin

328
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:27,766
Where's Master Li?

329
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,615
He's right here

330
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,825
Master Li, all the guests have arrived

331
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,638
Master Long invites you to Cold Fragrance Chamber

332
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:42,272
Please

333
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:46,764
Let me introduce you

334
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,164
My sworn brother Li Xunhuan

335
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:50,734
Li Ning of Wudang Clan

336
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:51,458
Pleased to meet you

337
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,639
Golden Fist Deng Lie

338
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:53,372
Delighted

339
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,457
Wang Chen, Golden Palms of Hua Shan

340
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:55,074
Pleased to meet you

341
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,992
Master Tian Qi, the lron Sword

342
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,350
Delighted

343
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:01,865
This is the renowned Master Gongsun

344
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,742
Pleased to meet you

345
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,683
Master Li was a legendary character ten years ago

346
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:12,270
l'm glad to finally meet you

347
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,931
Same here

348
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:24,793
He's Longsheng, young master of Hidden Sword Manor

349
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:30,006
He's proud and aloof, with incredible swordplay

350
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:34,249
Nonetheless he is infatuated with Lin Xianer

351
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:38,043
He's most eager to have Plum Blossom Bandit dead

352
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,932
Master Zhao is here

353
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:45,595
Master Zhao

354
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,935
Sorry l am late

355
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,718
No problem

356
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:55,058
Master Zhao, why are you here with so much gold?

357
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:56,487
There is a saying:

358
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,445
lt's everyone's duty to rid the society of evils

359
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:04,277
l hate the pests of the society

360
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:06,929
That's why l'm here today

361
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,183
l hope to eliminate a public enemy

362
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:11,170
And l brought along 10,000 taels of gold as...

363
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:13,534
a reward for the one who kills Plum Blossom Bandit

364
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:19,456
Where's Miss Lin?

365
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,308
Miss Lin ...

366
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:53,021
Please sit down

367
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,876
My father was murdered, l can't wait to get my revenge

368
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,101
That's why l take this opportunity here

369
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:04,956
... to say this in person

370
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:07,841
Whoever kills the Plum Blossom Bandit

371
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:10,317
regardless of age, status and wealth

372
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,345
l, Lin Xianer, will keep my promise to marry him

373
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,463
What Miss Lin is about to do...

374
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,344
has set a good example forjustice

375
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:24,231
l admire your courage

376
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:25,696
l don't deserve such praise from Master Zhao

377
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:34,502
This is ...

378
00:32:34,607 --> 00:32:38,153
My sworn brother Li Xunhuan

379
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,915
No wonder he's so good with the daggers

380
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:44,859
Have you two met?

381
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:48,095
Yes, and l've offended him

382
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,915
Can l have a word with Master Li alone?

383
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,203
Certainly

384
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,015
You should know why l'm here

385
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:04,108
You need that Gold Threaded Vest

386
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,951
because you'll go up against the Plum Blossom Bandit

387
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,925
That's right

388
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:08,627
ls that it?

389
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,425
lf you want to find out more...

390
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,235
Meet me here at midnight

391
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:16,807
And l'll let you know the details

392
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:09,375
There have been two deaths here

393
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:12,367
One is the younger brother of the Master lron Flute

394
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:15,394
The other is the only son of Master Zhao Zhengyi

395
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,659
They died at midnight

396
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:20,718
Why at midnight?

397
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:23,496
Because people say the Plum Blossom Bandit

398
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,792
always shows up around midnight

399
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:30,870
The Plum Blossom Bandit ?

400
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:53,320
Longsheng... young master of Hidden Sword Mansion

401
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,707
That's me

402
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,346
Why do you want to kill me?

403
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,227
Someone wants me to kill you

404
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,977
Hurry... inside

405
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:16,578
Look

406
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,205
Master You?

407
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,257
Someone over there

408
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:29,760
What's going on?

409
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:31,116
Who told you to come here?

410
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:31,878
Miss Lin Xianer

411
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,380
Bullshit

412
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:36,121
Miss Lin Xianer has left in the evening

413
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:38,040
l saw her off personally

414
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,093
That can't be,

415
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:42,671
l was just talking to her earlier

416
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,961
lf she hasn't told me to meet her here

417
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:46,320
... what would l be doing here?

418
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:47,640
To kill

419
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:48,932
To kill?

420
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,108
That's right

421
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:59,789
At midnight the Plum Blossom Bandit will show up

422
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:01,034
A concerned person

423
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:04,131
At midnight,

424
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:05,941
you killed Master You

425
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:06,813
Get him

426
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,785
You've got it all wrong

427
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,481
We all were set up in a trap

428
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:22,957
Let's sit down and talk this over

429
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,075
We're not interested

430
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,945
Looks like all of you...

431
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:32,943
are hell bent to kill me now

432
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:36,451
Don't come any closer

433
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:40,740
That was a warning,

434
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:44,285
next time it's gonna be for real

435
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,421
Zhao Zhengyi, you said earlier that

436
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,374
you want to get rid of the pests in society?

437
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,841
Why don't you do something !

438
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:04,216
Right, are you waiting for Master Tian Qi ?

439
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,797
Or Master Gongsun ?

440
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,502
Xunhuan, Xunhuan

441
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,242
That's so strange, you all wanted me dead

442
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:16,011
Why don't you do something?

443
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:18,068
l think you've got it wrong

444
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:19,493
My sworn brother won't be the Plum Blossom Bandit

445
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:20,956
Xunhuan, please hold your temper

446
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,595
Brother Long

447
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:27,740
Master Zhao, we must kill him today

448
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,204
What are you doing?

449
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,577
Stop it, everyone

450
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,294
Let him go first

451
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,953
No matter what crime he has done

452
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,872
... l'll take full responsibility

453
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:40,510
We just can't let the Plum Blossom Bandit walk away

454
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,208
That's right

455
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:46,138
Xunhuan, why don't you tell them ...

456
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:47,429
that you're no Plum Blossom Bandit?

457
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:51,506
lt took them a while to catch a suspect

458
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,380
l don't want to ruin their excitement

459
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:00,855
Chuanjia

460
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:08,790
Let's go, young master

461
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:10,636
Chuanjia

462
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:12,070
Xunhuan

463
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:16,132
Do you remember the day we first met?

464
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:17,491
The Justice Eight accused you for

465
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:19,785
... killing their head Meng Tianjie

466
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,853
l told you to leave just like you're doing now

467
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,490
You remember what you said then?

468
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:25,841
l said l didn't kill anyone

469
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:27,862
l won't leave...

470
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,002
before this matter is cleared up

471
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,761
Then why are you telling me to leave now?

472
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:36,005
l think you won't believe l'm the Plum Blossom Bandit!

473
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,030
But before they get to the bottom of all this...

474
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:40,525
they shouldn't hurt you now

475
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:43,790
There's no need for further investigation. We're right

476
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:44,842
He is the Plum Blossom Bandit

477
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,980
Shut up

478
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,047
Ah Fei

479
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,985
Who are you? What do you want?

480
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,907
Who are you? What do you want?

481
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,143
l want to teach you a lesson

482
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,277
My friend

483
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:24,157
Very impressive, at such a young age

484
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:27,383
l'm Zhao Zhengyi, the impartial person

485
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,717
And your name is ?

486
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:31,942
l want to be your friend

487
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:34,071
l don't have a name,

488
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,053
and l don't want you as my friend

489
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:43,048
Your package

490
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,718
So you killed Hua Feng

491
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:48,789
That's right, he was carrying the package

492
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:50,806
l knew he couldn't be a good person

493
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,797
l went back to look for you, but you weren't there

494
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:56,017
Then l found out you're here

495
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,429
What's going on?

496
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,216
They said l'm the Plum Blossom Bandit

497
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:03,924
Bullshit

498
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:05,553
Come on, let's go for a drink

499
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,602
Wait

500
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,489
lt's just the Plum Blossom Bandit we're after

501
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:13,725
You shouldn't get involved

502
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:15,539
Who said he's the Plum Blossom Bandit?

503
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:17,905
l said so

504
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:31,338
Shiyin

505
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,347
What's going on?

506
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,702
l have no idea

507
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:55,167
Tell the others that you're the Plum Blossom Bandit

508
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:56,249
Are you crazy?

509
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:58,505
How would l be the Plum Blossom Bandit ?

510
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,541
l'll ask you one more time

511
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,289
This is your last chance. Are you ?

512
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,038
Yes, l'm the Plum Blossom Bandit

513
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,501
You heard him, everyone

514
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,660
lf his word is to be trusted...

515
00:42:22,765 --> 00:42:24,389
He is the Plum Blossom Bandit

516
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:28,085
Young man, that's not fair

517
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:30,968
l mean this is how the martial world functions

518
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,369
The one with the quickest sword is the boss

519
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,454
So?

520
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,813
Anyone else?

521
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,356
Let's go

522
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:00,265
Wait

523
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:04,339
How do you know l'm not that Bandit ?

524
00:43:05,107 --> 00:43:08,405
l grew up in the wilderness, like an animal

525
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:11,612
l've an instinct to distinguish good and evil

526
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:13,490
lf l leave now...

527
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:14,700
They will be more certain that

528
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:17,067
... l'm the suspect

529
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,605
Xunhuan is right

530
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,973
He can leave when we're sure of the facts

531
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,793
Right

532
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:27,192
Fine, l'll be in the deserted temple in the outskirts

533
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,312
Come look for me should you need me

534
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:29,069
Great

535
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:31,027
Young brother

536
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:36,588
l don't need the Gold Threaded Vest, you take this

537
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,463
l got it, bye

538
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:15,903
So you're here for the package

539
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:21,612
The Plum Blossom Bandit?

540
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:30,827
You got hit with my Plum Blossom Nails

541
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:32,219
You shouldn't be able to move

542
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:48,602
Li Xunhuan was right

543
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:51,220
He knew someone would come after this vest

544
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,227
Before l left

545
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:55,005
He told me to wear it

546
00:45:20,691 --> 00:45:22,315
Very impressive

547
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:36,615
What are you doing here?

548
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,983
Here's your belongings. Leave now

549
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:40,649
Why must l leave?

550
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:44,480
Can't you tell they're doing this on purpose?

551
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:48,375
l've suspected it,

552
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,122
since the first day l came back to the country,

553
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:53,741
there's a trap waiting for me

554
00:45:54,404 --> 00:45:57,665
The Gold Threaded Vest, Lin Xianer

555
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,997
and now they call me the Plum Blossom Bandit

556
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:02,885
Who is trying to hurt me?

557
00:46:02,998 --> 00:46:04,979
Since you know that someone's trying to hurt you

558
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,030
You should better leave soon

559
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:10,442
Have you seen the spider webs?

560
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,350
Yes

561
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,607
We're like the spiders

562
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:22,370
We all want to make our own web

563
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,095
Then we can live in it forever

564
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:32,740
For everything that we've done

565
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:38,650
For money, love, friendship, for ourselves

566
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:42,865
We've made our own web to tie us up

567
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,799
Then we're trapped in it

568
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:49,610
No matter what we do, we can't get out

569
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:54,417
Some people call this fate

570
00:46:55,848 --> 00:47:00,118
Why are you back, cousin?

571
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:02,663
Destiny !

572
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:04,823
Xunhuan...

573
00:47:05,972 --> 00:47:08,569
Shiyin, what are you doing here?

574
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,016
She's here to see me

575
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:16,371
Although l released your vital points the other day

576
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,423
But l worried for your health

577
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:20,192
Here's some herbal tea for you

578
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:21,314
Thanks, Brother Long

579
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,711
Xiaoyun,

580
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,896
you know that he's not the Plum Blossom Bandit

581
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:28,229
Why don't you help him clear all this up?

582
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:29,314
Don't worry,

583
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:31,959
we'll soon know the truth

584
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:32,966
They've already sent someone...

585
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:35,363
to inform Master Xinmei of Shaolin Temple

586
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:36,863
They'll send a representative here soon

587
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,030
The Shaolin Temple is famous forjustice

588
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:41,561
They won't wrongly accuse people

589
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,026
Master, master

590
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:45,874
What is it?

591
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:47,642
Master Zhao said it's urgent

592
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:49,037
He's waiting for you in the hall

593
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:55,301
Folks, what's going on?

594
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:57,837
We've just received news

595
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,011
Master Xinmei will arrive soon

596
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,509
That's great

597
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,882
The bad news is ...

598
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:08,170
Mr. lron Flute is also on the road

599
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,715
He's famous for retaliation

600
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:12,413
lf he launches a fight,

601
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:15,553
We're no match for him

602
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,736
lf he gets here earlier than Master Xinmei

603
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:19,132
... and kills Li Xunhuan

604
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,675
Then what can we tell the Shaolin Temple?

605
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:27,866
Li Xunhuan's friend is a problem too

606
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:29,400
We must watch out for him

607
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:33,706
Don't worry, l've an idea

608
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,943
What? Your master is in danger

609
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:39,169
l heard that someone will kill my master tonight

610
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:40,980
He's a martial arts expert

611
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:41,744
Where is your master now?

612
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:43,103
Locked in the stock room

613
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:09,959
Li Xunhuan

614
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:17,928
So this is a trap !

615
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,536
l presumed you to be just

616
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,508
l told you to mind your own business

617
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:25,305
Get him

618
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:55,264
Don't worry, he won't run far

619
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,186
Mr. lron Flute

620
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:29,465
You're hurt? Got ambushed?

621
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,772
Why are you asking me? Since you've observed it

622
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,584
l don't like to attack people behind their back

623
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,537
lf they didn't attack me from behind

624
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:43,344
There's no way they could hurt me

625
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:47,865
You're very arrogant

626
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:53,607
l don't want to harm you since you're hurt

627
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,116
But l must teach you a lesson...

628
00:50:56,225 --> 00:50:58,277
for being arrogant

629
00:51:00,296 --> 00:51:04,258
Since you're hurt, l'll let you take three moves first

630
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:14,175
Why are you leaving?

631
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:17,057
l don't want you to die here

632
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:19,877
Why would l die?

633
00:51:19,988 --> 00:51:22,620
Because no one can take my three moves

634
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:26,691
You want to try ?

635
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:34,799
Forget 3, no one can take one move

636
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,410
l said l'll let you take three moves first

637
00:51:41,524 --> 00:51:44,121
That was one

638
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,284
Two more

639
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:56,718
Two

640
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,769
Three

641
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:03,300
Fine, that's it

642
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:33,603
lmpressive ! You were right

643
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,336
lt's hard to hurt you unless from behind

644
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:40,144
l've learnt one thing today

645
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:42,578
l can't let anyone to take three moves first

646
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:47,616
And you should have learnt one thing

647
00:52:47,733 --> 00:52:52,596
Every move should be fatal

648
00:53:09,722 --> 00:53:12,354
Mr. lron Flute, have you met the young man?

649
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:14,136
Yes

650
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,567
Did you kill him?

651
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:19,077
No

652
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:22,483
l'm here to kill Li Xunhuan

653
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,091
Xunhuan

654
00:53:35,363 --> 00:53:38,032
Why would they let me out of the stock room

655
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:39,605
... and drink here?

656
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:40,853
l heard that Master Xinmei...

657
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:42,908
will arrive tonight

658
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:44,405
You'll go to Shaolin Temple tomorrow

659
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:45,937
No he won't

660
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:52,263
Why not?

661
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:56,928
Because l'll kill him tonight

662
00:53:58,465 --> 00:53:59,568
Mr. lron Flute

663
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:06,874
Why don't you ask me why l want you dead ?

664
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:11,050
l don't want to offend you. And anyway...

665
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,225
lf l explain anything, you won't believe me

666
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:15,788
Then why would l bother !

667
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:18,884
Right, l'd kill you no matter what

668
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:02,715
Mr. lron Flute

669
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:10,375
No wonder my younger brother died at your hands

670
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:12,323
You're very good

671
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:16,355
So l killed your brother

672
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,908
You should tell me

673
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,784
What does he look like

674
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,948
So that l can say hello to him in hell

675
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,062
Bullshit

676
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:37,970
Amitabha Buddha

677
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,065
Master Xinmei

678
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:47,325
Master lron Flute,

679
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:50,528
why the rush to kill Li Xunhuan?

680
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:53,509
l must avenge for my brother

681
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,733
l heard that you'll always get even

682
00:55:58,845 --> 00:56:01,276
You'd never do anyone any favors

683
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:04,089
l wonder if you could make this an exception

684
00:56:04,203 --> 00:56:07,501
Let me and Li Xunhuan go to Shaolin Temple

685
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:09,486
Because my chief said he doesn't believe...

686
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:12,822
Li Xunhuan to be the Plum Blossom Bandit

687
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:18,115
Fine. With you here...

688
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:20,762
lt won't be easy for me to kill him

689
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:24,344
But if you're sure that he's the Plum Blossom Bandit

690
00:56:24,452 --> 00:56:27,334
... then l want to be the one to kill him

691
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,050
Thank you

692
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:21,677
Where am l ?

693
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:26,057
The guest room

694
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,145
You saved me?

695
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:33,268
You fainted outside

696
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:38,413
Where are my clothes?

697
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:41,478
l helped you change

698
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:48,051
l feel dizzy

699
00:57:48,162 --> 00:57:49,858
Take a nap

700
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:10,913
What is it, Zhaolong?

701
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:12,194
Our master said that...

702
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:15,261
Li Xunhuan will head for Shaolin tomorrow

703
00:58:20,344 --> 00:58:22,775
Take the Gold Threaded Vest to your master

704
00:58:22,883 --> 00:58:25,587
lnform him that Ah Fei is injured; that he's here

705
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,718
l'll make sure he recovers slowly

706
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:28,548
Yes

707
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:33,033
lnform the Five Poisons Kid

708
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:35,579
That Li Xunhuan will be on the road tomorrow

709
00:58:35,687 --> 00:58:37,489
Tell them to kill him on the way

710
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,899
100,000 taels of gold, 5 pearls will be delivered soon

711
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,018
Yes

712
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,933
Li Xunhuan, you must die

713
00:58:54,789 --> 00:59:00,352
Take care of yourself on the road

714
00:59:00,459 --> 00:59:01,988
Don't drink too much

715
00:59:02,895 --> 00:59:03,998
l know

716
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:05,843
Why don't you clamp his vital points?

717
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:07,094
Lock him up in chains

718
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:07,718
That's right

719
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,009
lt's not necessary

720
00:59:09,123 --> 00:59:11,175
He might run

721
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:15,870
He'd be already gone if he wished

722
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:30,065
Chuanjia, what are you doing here?

723
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:33,121
l heard that the master will head for Shaolin today

724
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:35,035
l'm here to escort

725
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,833
lt's an arduous journey

726
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:43,175
Twenty years l've worked for you

727
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,684
However tough the journey, l'm not afraid

728
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:51,174
Very loyal indeed !

729
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:56,115
Let's go, Master Li

730
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,420
Another bowl

731
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,047
Come... serve the guests

732
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:32,929
Master, they don't have the wine you like

733
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,143
Only the local stuff

734
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:35,229
lt's fine

735
01:00:40,173 --> 01:00:41,347
Don't touch anything

736
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,685
What's going on?

737
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,831
lt's poisoned

738
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:51,367
How do you know?

739
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:54,741
Look

740
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:00,730
Who did this?

741
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:01,218
l um...

742
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:02,297
Speak up

743
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:07,861
Not him, or he'd be gone already

744
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:09,595
What do you think he's staying here for?

745
01:01:10,512 --> 01:01:12,528
Right, l don't know what happened

746
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,056
My brother cooked the dishes

747
01:01:16,357 --> 01:01:17,566
That's my brother

748
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,531
What's going on?

749
01:01:24,637 --> 01:01:26,713
Who did this?

750
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:30,618
Look

751
01:01:35,075 --> 01:01:37,328
Five Poisons Kid

752
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:38,164
That's him

753
01:01:38,276 --> 01:01:40,185
Looks like you've got friends

754
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:42,582
But you've got more enemies

755
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,819
l've heard that the Five Poisons Kid

756
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:48,111
... has many ways to poison a person

757
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:50,824
And if he is determined to kill someone...

758
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,600
then the person will die for sure

759
01:01:53,618 --> 01:01:57,544
That's right. Unless he never eats !

760
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:45,107
Let's take a break here

761
01:02:45,215 --> 01:02:46,567
Sure

762
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:49,143
Let's take a break here

763
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:52,346
You have a rest too, Master Li

764
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:07,721
Master Tian, you must be starving

765
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:12,453
Of course. We haven't eaten in three days

766
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:44,882
Old man, here's 10 taels

767
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,134
Can l have the steamed buns?

768
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:48,910
Ten taels?

769
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:51,597
That's right

770
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,653
Dear, honey

771
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:04,497
We have ten taels

772
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,287
Look, we've got food

773
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,065
You can't eat the buns

774
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:15,557
Nonsense

775
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:18,864
You saw him eating it

776
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:20,711
But we can't eat it

777
01:04:22,424 --> 01:04:25,484
Because the Five Poisons Kid isn't after him

778
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:29,172
How come he won't be poisoned?

779
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:30,902
There's antidote in the soup

780
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:33,798
He drank the soup beforehand

781
01:04:56,137 --> 01:04:57,939
How do you know it's poisoned?

782
01:04:58,051 --> 01:05:01,206
l know the man has left

783
01:05:01,322 --> 01:05:02,531
The house is empty

784
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:10,709
Steamed buns

785
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,489
Steamed buns

786
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:19,544
Fresh and hot

787
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,944
Steamed buns

788
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:28,110
Behave children

789
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,753
Come here and eat your noodles. Be quiet

790
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:33,527
l'll give you five taels

791
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:34,852
l'll take the buns

792
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:37,361
That ...

793
01:05:37,922 --> 01:05:40,175
Since the children want to eat the buns

794
01:05:40,288 --> 01:05:41,948
l'll swap the buns with noodles

795
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:43,902
That won't be fair to you

796
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:44,770
Never mind

797
01:05:45,229 --> 01:05:46,438
Say thank you

798
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:47,831
Thank you!

799
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,419
Let's go eat the buns, open up

800
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:57,612
l think l can have these noodles now

801
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:06,275
lf the Five Poisons Kid could predict that

802
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:08,778
the kids don't want to eat the noodles

803
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:12,186
and that l'd swap with them

804
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:14,894
And he's poisoned the noodles

805
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:18,136
Then l have nothing to say even l'll die

806
01:06:18,455 --> 01:06:19,807
Go on

807
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:22,977
Let's eat

808
01:06:23,361 --> 01:06:25,092
l know what you're trying to do

809
01:06:25,205 --> 01:06:26,758
You want us to starve

810
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,499
So that you can escape easily

811
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:30,246
You can't eat that, Master Tian

812
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:33,271
This place is deserted

813
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:36,476
There's not another house around here

814
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:38,205
You know, if l'd want to poison someone

815
01:06:38,322 --> 01:06:39,531
... l'd rather do it here

816
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:42,453
Go take a look inside

817
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,262
l think the whole family is gone

818
01:06:53,525 --> 01:06:56,929
lt's really empty

819
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:29,429
Finally we're almost there

820
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,653
l don't understand you. Why do you insist...

821
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:33,814
on bringing my master to Shaolin temple?

822
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:36,725
We invited Master Li

823
01:07:36,842 --> 01:07:37,565
... because there've been thefts

824
01:07:37,676 --> 01:07:41,045
of martial arts scriptures in Shaolin Temple

825
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:43,208
What's that got to do with the Plum Blossom Bandit?

826
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:45,080
When the scripture thief

827
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:46,994
... killed our people,

828
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,049
He left a mark of the Plum Blossom Bandit

829
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:50,924
You think my master is the Plum Blossom Bandit?

830
01:07:51,036 --> 01:07:54,191
No, but l do suspect someone

831
01:07:54,307 --> 01:07:57,568
l haven't said anything for l've got no proof

832
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:02,192
lf anything happens to me...

833
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,361
please tell my fellow Shaolin disciples

834
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:05,782
The name of the suspect is written

835
01:08:05,893 --> 01:08:08,075
...on the last page of my journal

836
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:11,767
The last page of yourjournal

837
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:16,530
Throw it away, don't touch it

838
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,701
A poisonous toad... Run !

839
01:08:21,758 --> 01:08:24,604
Chuanjia

840
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:28,569
Master, l think l've been poisoned

841
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,715
You must be working for the Five Poisons Kid

842
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:41,998
That's right

843
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:19,860
Chuanjia

844
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:23,854
l know l'm dying

845
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:25,661
Take care of yourself

846
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,444
Chuanjia...

847
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:30,493
Look

848
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:34,638
Poor snake

849
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:39,436
lt's a shame ...

850
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:55,408
Are you the Five Poisons Kid?

851
01:09:55,522 --> 01:09:58,926
That's right

852
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:04,671
l've been expecting you...

853
01:10:04,777 --> 01:10:10,411
for l promised someone l'll kill you

854
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:11,974
Master, be careful

855
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:15,380
Five poisonous cold needles

856
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,889
You know quite a lot

857
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:28,288
Don't worry about me, just run!

858
01:11:41,985 --> 01:11:47,584
The Legendary Master Li and your daggers

859
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:51,644
Master Li, l'm delighted to meet you

860
01:11:51,762 --> 01:11:53,458
Thank you

861
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:57,533
Master, l'm just an ordinary man

862
01:11:57,642 --> 01:12:00,975
l'm lucky to meet you today

863
01:12:01,086 --> 01:12:02,401
lt's a pleasure

864
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:04,243
There's no need to be so modest

865
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:08,105
Thank you for escorting Master Xinmei here

866
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,330
l appreciate it very much

867
01:12:10,445 --> 01:12:11,974
You're very welcome

868
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:13,153
Master

869
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:15,517
How do you know he didn't hurt Master Xinmei?

870
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,219
Shut up

871
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:20,489
Don't you know that Master Xinmei...

872
01:12:20,604 --> 01:12:23,236
has been poisoned by Five Poisons Needles?

873
01:12:23,353 --> 01:12:29,153
Anyone could have poisoned him

874
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:30,547
You are right

875
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:33,643
Do you think that ...

876
01:12:33,756 --> 01:12:36,081
l've hurt Master Xinmei?

877
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:39,417
Only you could answer that

878
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:41,643
No, someone else can give you an answer

879
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:42,658
Who?

880
01:12:43,497 --> 01:12:45,857
Master Xinmei himself

881
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:48,540
Why don't you ask him when he wakes up?

882
01:12:56,127 --> 01:12:57,336
Time for dinner

883
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,840
Where do you think you're going?

884
01:13:40,904 --> 01:13:42,398
What happened?

885
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,755
You killed Master Xinmei while we were eating

886
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,547
And you're pretending you didn't do it?

887
01:13:49,254 --> 01:13:49,739
What?

888
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:50,711
Get him

889
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,327
Stop it

890
01:14:16,392 --> 01:14:17,601
Master Li

891
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:20,489
What's going on?

892
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:23,373
Master Xinmei was killed

893
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,186
You're the murderer

894
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,027
You're wrong

895
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:29,775
About the scriptures thief, Master Xinmei said...

896
01:14:29,892 --> 01:14:33,047
He has the name of the suspect

897
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:34,858
He's written the name on the last page

898
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,023
... of his journal

899
01:14:44,156 --> 01:14:46,729
The last page has been torn off !

900
01:14:47,218 --> 01:14:47,869
That's simple

901
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,043
l would tear out the last page...

902
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,739
and make up a story if l was the murderer

903
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:56,884
How would the thief know...

904
01:14:56,994 --> 01:14:59,496
about Master Xinmei's journal?

905
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:29,485
You can get up now

906
01:15:31,682 --> 01:15:34,386
Do you want your golden vest back ?

907
01:15:34,499 --> 01:15:37,239
No, l'm here to see you

908
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,588
l always thought flowers are the most beautiful...

909
01:15:56,524 --> 01:16:01,316
things on earth... but today l've seen a woman

910
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:03,131
... who is more beautiful than flowers

911
01:16:03,586 --> 01:16:05,459
You think l'm pretty?

912
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:15,307
Have you been in love before?

913
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:18,116
No

914
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:21,006
You know nothing about me

915
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:26,572
l was in a coma for the past few days

916
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:30,651
This is the first time we've spoken

917
01:16:32,012 --> 01:16:34,752
Don't ponder upon this

918
01:16:36,465 --> 01:16:37,401
Don't move

919
01:16:42,796 --> 01:16:43,970
What is it?

920
01:16:46,032 --> 01:16:49,851
There's a poisonous spider on your neck

921
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:54,790
Thank you

922
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:08,084
lt's so strange

923
01:17:08,195 --> 01:17:09,618
A poisonous spider in such a beautiful environment

924
01:17:11,186 --> 01:17:15,148
You can'tjudge a book by its cover

925
01:17:15,918 --> 01:17:18,385
l've heard that poppy is a pretty flower too

926
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:23,983
You were holding the spiderjust now

927
01:17:24,094 --> 01:17:26,798
lf you got bitten, you could die

928
01:17:27,818 --> 01:17:32,373
Hmm, l didn't think about that at all

929
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:36,121
Maybe l was in a hurry

930
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:43,467
There's only one kind of love...

931
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,220
which makes you disregard your own life

932
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:49,281
That's the love between a man and a woman

933
01:17:50,536 --> 01:17:53,240
You'll understand more later

934
01:17:54,259 --> 01:17:57,628
But l'll always remember that

935
01:17:57,738 --> 01:17:59,505
You've saved my life today

936
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:02,571
And l'll remember you've been kind to me

937
01:18:03,897 --> 01:18:04,797
So...

938
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:07,123
Have you heard anything about Master Li?

939
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:13,629
Why do you care about Li Xunhuan so much?

940
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,455
Because he's my only friend

941
01:18:19,345 --> 01:18:22,571
l heard that Master Xinmei was murdered

942
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,952
Shaolin Temple has kept Master Li in house arrest

943
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:29,075
... until they've found the Plum Blossom Bandit

944
01:18:31,904 --> 01:18:35,343
Now that a second Bandit has surfaced...

945
01:18:35,453 --> 01:18:36,733
lt's proof enough that,

946
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,646
Li Xunhuan is not the Plum Blossom Bandit

947
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:40,844
Would you know of anyone...

948
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,823
who is rich and nasty that l should kill ?

949
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:54,690
You are Shen Laosan ?

950
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:58,410
Do you know why l'm here?

951
01:19:13,724 --> 01:19:14,732
Let go

952
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,009
From Shaolin ?

953
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:23,283
Stop it, master

954
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:28,576
Why do you want to catch him ?

955
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,904
He's the accomplice of the Plum Blossom Bandit

956
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,474
Of course we can catch him

957
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:35,357
My friend is innocent

958
01:19:36,513 --> 01:19:38,386
l hope you'll let him go

959
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:41,307
lf he's the Plum Blossom Bandit

960
01:19:41,419 --> 01:19:44,609
Then you're his accomplice; just as guilty

961
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:48,197
Zhao Zhengyi, you've gone too far

962
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:49,374
What if l have?

963
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:53,905
You must be fair

964
01:19:54,013 --> 01:19:56,515
For your namesake

965
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:59,505
You can't bully someone like this

966
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:15,853
Master Zhao, no one else is here

967
01:20:15,967 --> 01:20:19,300
No spies, only you

968
01:21:48,305 --> 01:21:49,443
What do you want?

969
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,023
We want to nab the Plum Blossom Bandit

970
01:21:52,131 --> 01:21:53,411
We want to find the scriptures stealer

971
01:21:54,428 --> 01:21:57,239
What if they are two different persons?

972
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:59,887
lf we can locate the scriptures

973
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:02,283
l promise you, Shaolin won't get involved

974
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:05,384
You must return the scriptures in three days

975
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:08,091
Three days? That's a long time

976
01:22:08,901 --> 01:22:10,324
l only need an hour

977
01:22:17,947 --> 01:22:18,598
Yuanfeng

978
01:22:18,712 --> 01:22:20,099
Yes master

979
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,523
Search the rooms of Dongning Chambers

980
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:26,395
Yes master

981
01:22:26,784 --> 01:22:27,792
Follow me

982
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,259
Why are you searching our rooms?

983
01:22:30,368 --> 01:22:33,428
Because Master Xinmei told me

984
01:22:33,535 --> 01:22:36,002
... you are the scriptures stealers

985
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:40,069
The Yijin Scripture which was stolen...

986
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,460
recently is still inside this temple

987
01:22:43,311 --> 01:22:44,864
Master, we've found the scriptures

988
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,154
... in their rooms

989
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:49,634
They must have planted the stolen scriptures

990
01:23:00,777 --> 01:23:02,508
Here's the Yijin Scripture

991
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,900
We've been framed for sure

992
01:23:05,543 --> 01:23:06,966
How would you know that...

993
01:23:07,074 --> 01:23:08,983
where we placed the scriptures?

994
01:23:09,683 --> 01:23:11,900
Look, they are not the scripture stealers

995
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:13,543
Wouldn't find even if they try hard

996
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,878
l'd say, even if we planted the scriptures here

997
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,587
We couldn't have placed it in the secret compartment

998
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:31,003
Master Xinmei has told me that...

999
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:33,925
He suspects the scriptures stealer is an insider

1000
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,777
One who has access to the library

1001
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:40,472
And only the senior masters at Dongning Chambers

1002
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:43,846
... are eligible; that's why l took a risk

1003
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:47,360
lf Mater Xinjian would've been a little more calm...

1004
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:49,519
My plan wouldn't work

1005
01:23:56,687 --> 01:23:57,303
Don't move

1006
01:23:57,418 --> 01:23:58,770
Let me get hold of the Plum Blossom Bandit

1007
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:04,954
Don't move

1008
01:24:07,646 --> 01:24:09,448
Master Zhao, if you want to take the credit

1009
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,920
l'll pass him to your custody later

1010
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:16,341
The martial world wouldn't have that many grudges

1011
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:18,287
... if not for people like them

1012
01:24:18,397 --> 01:24:21,137
A bunch of hypocrites !

1013
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,317
Let's go

1014
01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:29,065
Wait

1015
01:24:32,488 --> 01:24:35,157
l've promised Master Xinmei...

1016
01:24:35,272 --> 01:24:37,110
that l'd catch the scriptures stealers

1017
01:24:37,881 --> 01:24:40,976
A promise is a promise

1018
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:46,713
C'mon, let's see how you actually catch me

1019
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:53,771
Don't move

1020
01:24:58,095 --> 01:24:59,103
Come on

1021
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:15,836
Who's the Plum Blossom Bandit? Who told you to steal?

1022
01:25:23,806 --> 01:25:24,837
What did he say?

1023
01:25:28,642 --> 01:25:30,029
He said it's me

1024
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:34,196
What are you trying to do?

1025
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:35,700
To seize the Plum Blossom Bandit

1026
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:36,988
You are too rash

1027
01:25:37,096 --> 01:25:38,720
l'll kill you if you move again

1028
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,670
You ...

1029
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:52,645
Ever thought the Bandit perhaps mightn't be a man ?

1030
01:25:53,135 --> 01:25:54,724
Not a man? Then what?

1031
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,413
A woman of course

1032
01:25:58,702 --> 01:25:59,805
A woman?

1033
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,936
Right... since the beginning

1034
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:05,790
The Plum Blossom Bandit has been trying to set you up

1035
01:26:05,905 --> 01:26:07,008
And these people who are against us

1036
01:26:07,122 --> 01:26:10,241
... are all male, martial arts experts

1037
01:26:10,984 --> 01:26:13,759
Only a very beautiful woman...

1038
01:26:13,872 --> 01:26:16,232
Could make this happen

1039
01:26:16,795 --> 01:26:18,811
And there's only one woman who knows that...

1040
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:20,861
l was going to kill Shen Laosan

1041
01:26:46,228 --> 01:26:49,347
l heard the news from Shaolin Temple

1042
01:26:49,464 --> 01:26:51,337
l knew you'd come here to look for me

1043
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:08,626
You've been trying to kill Master Li... why?

1044
01:27:08,739 --> 01:27:11,135
He killed my father

1045
01:27:11,243 --> 01:27:12,381
Who might he be ?

1046
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:14,928
My father worked for the Plum Blossom Bandit

1047
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:18,511
You killed him ten years ago by Tai Lake

1048
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:22,817
That's why you try to set him up

1049
01:27:23,003 --> 01:27:24,212
There was a monk called...

1050
01:27:24,325 --> 01:27:27,136
Xinjian who contacted me

1051
01:27:27,248 --> 01:27:30,996
He said that the Plum Blossom Bandit is still alive

1052
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:33,850
l could have my revenge. We set up a trap

1053
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:35,386
... for you

1054
01:27:36,225 --> 01:27:38,063
We used the martial arts experts...

1055
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:41,232
as pawns. They all lust after beauty

1056
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,936
Then the deaths of Zhao Zhengyi's son

1057
01:27:44,365 --> 01:27:45,894
... and Mr. lron Flute's brother

1058
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:48,532
We were hoping that they'd get rid of you

1059
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:51,979
So you knew who's the Plum Blossom Bandit all along?

1060
01:27:52,089 --> 01:27:53,298
No. Didn't have a clue

1061
01:27:53,412 --> 01:27:56,152
l've only contacted Monk Xinjian

1062
01:27:56,786 --> 01:28:00,225
Now it doesn't matter who's the Plum Blossom Bandit

1063
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:03,528
Because l must kill you

1064
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:10,283
l'd advise you not to

1065
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:12,263
Because even if you practise for another 10 years

1066
01:28:12,373 --> 01:28:14,033
You're not Master Li's match

1067
01:28:14,147 --> 01:28:15,356
That's my problem

1068
01:28:21,732 --> 01:28:23,570
Miss Lin, have you ever thought that...

1069
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:25,863
l did everyone a favor by killing your father?

1070
01:28:25,977 --> 01:28:27,186
He's my father after all

1071
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,442
Miss Lin, l owe you a favor

1072
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:46,014
l don't wish to see you die here

1073
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:47,401
You better leave

1074
01:28:55,793 --> 01:28:59,019
Mr. lron Flute, you heard her

1075
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:03,166
She's the one who killed your brother

1076
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:12,561
What are you doing?

1077
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:13,603
Avenging my brother

1078
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:16,486
l didn't kill him

1079
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:18,365
The real Plum Blossom Bandit did

1080
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:19,127
Who'd believe you?

1081
01:29:19,243 --> 01:29:20,251
Come on then

1082
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:23,796
You all spread out

1083
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:28,806
Mr. lron Flute, this is a duel

1084
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,221
C'mon, move

1085
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:52,082
Wait

1086
01:29:52,435 --> 01:29:55,768
Mr. lron Flute, Zhao Zhengyi, if you want your revenge,

1087
01:29:55,879 --> 01:29:57,860
you should find the real killer

1088
01:29:58,697 --> 01:30:00,012
Where is the real killer?

1089
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:01,059
l know

1090
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:03,180
Shiyin

1091
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,806
Cousin, l think you know who's the real

1092
01:30:07,917 --> 01:30:09,269
... Plum Blossom Bandit

1093
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:12,959
Tell them

1094
01:30:13,067 --> 01:30:14,691
l will if you don't

1095
01:30:17,903 --> 01:30:18,934
Shiyin

1096
01:30:22,773 --> 01:30:25,548
-Shiyin... -Miss Lin

1097
01:30:25,869 --> 01:30:27,043
Shiyin

1098
01:30:28,271 --> 01:30:32,197
Cousin, you ...

1099
01:30:32,306 --> 01:30:34,702
You should know

1100
01:30:34,812 --> 01:30:41,905
You ... it's been ten years ...

1101
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:44,131
Shiyin

1102
01:31:09,568 --> 01:31:10,635
Wait

1103
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:20,770
Don't go

1104
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,305
l know where he is

1105
01:31:24,042 --> 01:31:27,031
l'll take care of it

1106
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:50,513
l've been expecting you

1107
01:31:50,623 --> 01:31:52,496
Why did you kill Shiyin?

1108
01:31:52,606 --> 01:31:53,993
That's because...

1109
01:31:54,102 --> 01:31:56,699
l must kill all those who know my secret

1110
01:31:57,616 --> 01:31:59,074
That includes you

1111
01:32:02,766 --> 01:32:04,390
This duel should have...

1112
01:32:04,505 --> 01:32:07,695
taken place ten years ago at Tai Lake

1113
01:32:08,332 --> 01:32:11,736
Nevertheless it's happening today

1114
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:15,945
So you're the real Plum Blossom Bandit?

1115
01:32:16,056 --> 01:32:20,575
Yes, you tried to catch me ten years ago

1116
01:32:20,683 --> 01:32:23,529
l knew l was no match for you then

1117
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:26,802
That's why l set a trap

1118
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:28,892
And pretended to save your life

1119
01:32:28,998 --> 01:32:31,429
Then l've been living in Xingyin Manor

1120
01:32:31,538 --> 01:32:35,500
l sent Xinjian to steal the scriptures from Shaolin

1121
01:32:35,609 --> 01:32:38,455
And l've been practising all these years

1122
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,800
So even if you attempt to take my life today...

1123
01:32:43,054 --> 01:32:45,723
lt won't be as easy as ten years back

1124
01:32:46,568 --> 01:32:50,173
So you've never loved Shiyin !

1125
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:51,572
No

1126
01:32:52,413 --> 01:32:56,825
And frankly speaking, l didn't save your life then

1127
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,987
Ten years ago...

1128
01:33:00,102 --> 01:33:02,390
At the time when you thought l saved you;

1129
01:33:02,503 --> 01:33:08,481
lt was in fact the beginning of a revenge.

1130
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:09,943
Only that l used sentiments rather than weapons

1131
01:33:17,011 --> 01:33:21,139
However, when it comes to using sentiments...

1132
01:33:21,256 --> 01:33:25,110
You've got to be like me... heartless !

1133
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:28,971
Otherwise l'd be like you

1134
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:32,108
Your whole life's been controlled by sentiments

1135
01:33:32,215 --> 01:33:35,405
You were living in regrets and pain

1136
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:40,351
Before Xinjian died, he told me that...

1137
01:33:40,461 --> 01:33:44,802
you're the Plum Blossom Bandit. l didn't

1138
01:33:44,914 --> 01:33:46,990
... blow your cover for l still had faith in you

1139
01:33:48,324 --> 01:33:51,348
That's your main weakness

1140
01:33:52,777 --> 01:33:57,083
You believe in sentiments among people

1141
01:33:58,275 --> 01:34:01,916
You easily gave up the woman you love...

1142
01:34:02,032 --> 01:34:04,772
and your property and wealth

1143
01:34:06,172 --> 01:34:12,874
Of course, the world might say you're sentimental

1144
01:34:12,991 --> 01:34:16,810
But you're just a silly fool

1145
01:34:18,837 --> 01:34:22,478
Let me tell you once again

1146
01:34:22,594 --> 01:34:27,244
You can't be a sentimental swordsman

1147
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:32,813
And the sword you wield...

1148
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:35,881
ought to be a merciless one

1149
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:47,147
Are you done with your tale, Long Xiaoyun?

1150
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:48,957
l said that before

1151
01:34:49,836 --> 01:34:53,346
lt's a simple story...

1152
01:34:53,455 --> 01:34:56,087
about revenge of the Plum Blossom Bandit

1153
01:34:57,665 --> 01:35:02,706
Now it's my turn to tell my story

1154
01:35:07,128 --> 01:35:10,638
l want to know how you dodged my daggers

1155
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:20,585
Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss!

1156
01:35:21,218 --> 01:35:25,108
You never expected me to use this magnet

1157
01:35:30,786 --> 01:35:34,949
The last 10 years l managed to find a lot about you

1158
01:35:35,797 --> 01:35:40,873
You never carry more than 12 daggers

1159
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:08,533
There's a sword at the back

1160
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:15,735
To kill an unarmed man

1161
01:36:15,842 --> 01:36:17,229
lt's something very novel to me

1162
01:37:19,754 --> 01:37:23,015
l wanted to use Lin Xianer's eagerness for revenge

1163
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:23,924
And l also wanted to exploit the hypocrites

1164
01:37:24,034 --> 01:37:26,774
... as my pawns

1165
01:37:26,888 --> 01:37:28,477
But l'd never have thought that...

1166
01:37:28,591 --> 01:37:30,737
l have to kill you personally

1167
01:38:30,069 --> 01:38:33,473
l've told you before, l must kill you

1168
01:38:34,244 --> 01:38:39,665
Because you're sentimental, and l'm ruthless

1169
01:38:47,534 --> 01:38:49,787
Another sentimental man

1170
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:57,612
Don't move

1171
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,666
Maybe you didn't think l've the Gold Threaded Vest

1172
01:39:10,775 --> 01:39:11,783
Hold it !

1173
01:39:13,107 --> 01:39:15,183
lf you step one inch further

1174
01:39:15,299 --> 01:39:17,101
l swear that this broken sword

1175
01:39:17,212 --> 01:39:19,014
... will be pierced through your throat

1176
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,162
The magnet is too far away

1177
01:39:28,555 --> 01:39:31,853
Even with the broken sword...

1178
01:39:31,964 --> 01:39:34,704
l still have time to kill him

1179
01:40:28,014 --> 01:40:29,816
Although you could avoid...

1180
01:40:29,928 --> 01:40:33,083
all the man-made weapons

1181
01:40:33,442 --> 01:40:35,838
But you can't escape

1182
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:38,200
... from the ice made by the gods !
