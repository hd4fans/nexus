片名  公众之敌

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,600
这是经济大萧条时期的第四年，但对于
约翰・迪林杰，阿尔文・卡佩斯和
娃娃脸尼尔森来说这是抢劫银行的黄金年代

5
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,668
到了，从里面出来
All right,
get out of there.

6
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,214
我们走
Let's go.

7
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,880
往前走，找个位子坐下
All the way down
and take a seat.

8
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,426
快点走，别磨磨蹭蹭的，快点！
Let's go. Stop your
dragging. Let's go! Move!

9
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,058
走，快走
Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,030
- 动手！排队，都排好队！
- 都起来！到右边去
Let's go! Line up! Line up!
DIETRICH: Move! Move! Right turn!

11
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,204
- 跟我走
- 把头低下
Stay with me! PIERPONT:
Keep your head down!

12
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,789
排成一排
Line up! Line up!

13
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,124
大家都准备好了？我们走
DIETRICH: Everybody ready?
Come on.

14
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,292
- 排好队！
- 滚开！
Line up!
Get off me!

15
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,587
- 来啊

Come on.
PIERPONT: One...

16
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,881
- 现在带我们去更衣室
- …2，3
Now march us to the changing
rooms. ...two, three.

17
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,507
- 走，我们走
- 排好队！
Go. Let's go.
Line up!

18
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,137
我认得你
I know you.

19
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,808
你刚被假释出去还没多久吧
You just got paroled out of
here. You didn't last very long.

20
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,519
是什么时候来着？
When was that?

21
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,146
8星期前
Eight weeks ago.

22
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,857
关了9年
Did nine years.

23
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,359
约翰，约翰・迪林杰
John. John Dillinger.

24
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,777
没错
That's right.

25
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,988
我的朋友都喊我约翰
My friends call me John.

26
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,160
但是像你这种狗娘养的杂碎
最好称呼我迪林杰先生
But a son-of-a-bitch screw like you
better address me as Mr. Dillinger.

27
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,333
打开，打开门，不然我一枪崩了你
Open it! Open it or
I'll blow you in half.

28
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,461
靠墙站好
Against the wall.

29
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,177
现在把你们的衣服脱掉
Take your
clothes off, now!

30
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,970
干得好，小子
DIETRICH: You did it, kid.

31
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,180
那当然，沃特
Sure did, Walter.

32
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,517
把那件该死的夹克给我
Give me
the goddamn jacket.

33
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,727
瑞德！
Red!

34
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,576
快脱，快点
脱衣服，把你的衣服脱了
Come on. Hurry up! PIERPONT: Get
undressed. Take your clothes off.

35
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,786
快点
Come on.

36
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,414
你还敢瞪我！操你妈的！
You eyeballing me,
you son of a bitch?

37
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,875
住手！肖斯！
Cut it out,
Shouse!

38
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,336
肖斯！肖斯！
Shouse! Shouse!

39
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,055
封锁监狱！
Lockdown!

40
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,979
把他们赶到院子里去！
Bring them in
from the yard!

41
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,365
他们在那里！
There they are!

42
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
沃特！顶住
Walter! Come on.

43
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
沃特・迪崔克死了，都是你搞出来的
Walter Dietrich's dead
'cause of you.

44
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,274
那个该死的警卫不听他的话，强尼
The bastard guard wouldn't
do what he was told, Johnny.

45
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,069
霍莫尔？
Homer?

46
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,695
他得付出点代价，强尼
Just let him
have it, Johnny.

47
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
皮特？
Pete?

48
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,239
随便你
It's up to you.

49
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,891
农庄有多远？
How far is the farm?

50
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,976
3.2英里
3.2 miles.

51
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,087
我们都好了
We're ready!

52
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,214
好，我们走
Okay. Let's go!

53
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,218
把这些烧了好吗？宝贝儿
Burn these,
okay, honey?

54
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,096
谢谢你把我们弄出来，瑞德
Thanks for
getting us out, Red.

55
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,305
是强尼定的计划
It was Johnny's plan.

56
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,640
是的，但还是谢谢你
Yeah, but thanks.

57
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,109
先生，让我跟你走
Take me with you, mister.

58
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,028
对不起，我做不到，亲爱的
I can't, darling.
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,842
欢迎回来，皮特
Welcome back, Pete.

60
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,597
我们去芝加哥搞点钱花花
Let's go to Chicago
and make some money.

61
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
佛洛伊德，别跑！
Floyd, halt!

62
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,635
梅尔文，当心！
Melvin, look out!

63
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,101
小白脸佛洛伊德，你被捕了
Pretty Boy Floyd,
you are under arrest.

64
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,062
是查尔斯，查尔斯・佛洛伊德
It's Charles.
Charles Floyd.

65
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,526
- 你是谁？
- 梅尔文・普韦斯，调查局
[备注：联邦调查局（FBI）的前身]
Who are you? Melvin Purvis,
Bureau of Investigation.

66
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,445
你的朋友哈里・坎贝尔呢？
Where is your friend,
Harry Campbell?

67
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,282
我快要死了
I believe
you've killed me.

68
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,286
你就等着烂在地狱里吧
So you can go
rot in hell.

69
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,702
史波特，去看看
Sport.

70
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,338
- 瑞德，打电话给奥斯卡
- 好
Red, call Oscar.
Okay.

71
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,092
- 嗨，洋娃娃
- 我们得去换内裤了
Hi, there, doll.
Let's switch out the shorts.

72
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,302
我们要用到伯曼？
We gonna
use Berman?

73
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,763
对，搞辆普利茅斯还有埃塞克斯
[备注：都是克莱斯勒当时推出的车型]
Yeah. Get a Plymouth
and an Essex.

74
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,266
其他妞呢？
Where them other gals?

75
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,352
- 你叫了马蒂没？
- 当然叫了
You get a hold of Marty?
Sure did.

76
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,478
你还好吗，强尼先生
How you doing,
Mr. Johnny?

77
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,729
很不错，史波特
Doing great, Sport.

78
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,866
上面的主弹簧太紧了
卡壳了两次
The main spring's too tight
on this one. Jammed twice.

79
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,993
我割掉了两圈
I cut off
one coil.

80
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,000
朝右边偏了
And it rides up
and to the right.

81
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,794
我会把卡口弄大的
I widen port.

82
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,679
- 嘿，瑞德
- 嗨，哈里
Hey, Red.
Hi, Harry.

83
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,393
哈里，这是皮特
皮特，这是哈里・伯曼
Harry, this is Pete.
Pete, this is Harry Berman.

84
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,977
嗨，皮特.你好
Hi, Pete.
How you doing?

85
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,563
- 你带了什么车来？
- 这几辆都是直排八缸的
So, what do we got? Got a
couple of nice straight eights.

86
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,400
里面都动过，我改了化油器
Bored them out. Rebuilt
the carburetors myself.

87
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,984
这些车绝对快
These are some
really fast cars.

88
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,778
给各位用那就是绝配
Perfect work cars for
a couple of gentlemen.

89
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,865
- 强尼，过得怎么样？
- 不错
Johnny, how are you?
Good.

90
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,370
马蒂
Marty,

91
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,332
我和我的弟兄们安全了么
tell me that me
and my boys are okay.

92
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,583
只要你还呆在东芝加哥
As long as you stay
in East Chicago,

93
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,086
这里随时随刻都是你的庇护所
you're in safe haven,
any time you want.

94
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,756
这是你的那份
Extra cake's in here.

95
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,966
谢谢
Thanks.

96
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,843
嘿，安娜
Hey, Anna.

97
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,055
我现在的店在芝加哥的哈斯特
到时候过来看看姑娘们
I opened up in Chicago on Halsted
now. Come by and see the girls.

98
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,491
你好吗？
PIERPONT: How are you?

99
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:11,665
- 趴下！
- 现在趴下，快点！趴下！快点！
On the floor! Now! Now! Do it!
Do it! On the floor, now! Now!

100
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,002
我们玩个游戏吧，经理先生
名字叫做转数字
Let's play a game, Mr. President.
It's called Spin the Dial.

101
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,880
你，把手举高！快点！
还有你，坐下！
PIERPONT: You, hands up!
Come on. And, you, sit down!

102
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,133
趴下！
On the floor!

103
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,718
放轻松
Relax, pops.

104
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,722
打开
Open it up.

105
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,309
都拿来，动作快！都闭嘴！
Empty it! Move, move!
Shut up!

106
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,852
钥匙很多
It's one of these.

107
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,066
英雄都要死，胆小鬼才能活着
你自己选
You can be a dead hero
or a live coward.

108
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,361
- 打开
- 全部！
Get it open.
All of it!

109
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,947
你，举手，快点！
PIERPONT: You, hands up.
Come on!

110
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,783
全部搬干净！
Empty it! All of it!

111
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,660
嘿，坐下！
PIERPONT: Hey, sit down!

112
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,953
把钱推过来！
Push it to me!

113
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,082
别动！
And don't move!

114
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,557
我们有伴了！
PIERPONT: We got company!

115
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,778
走开！
Move out of there!

116
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,625
这钱你留着
我们不抢你的钱，只要银行的钱
You can put it away. Not here for
your money. Here for the bank's money.

117
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,168
我说了，让路！
I said,
move it out of there!

118
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,378
凭什么？
What for?

119
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,468
小姐你过来，我们去兜个风
Come here, sister.
Let's take a ride.

120
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,734
趴下！
DETECTIVE: Get down!

121
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,523
都上车，小姐，你也是
Beat it.
You, too, sister.

122
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,778
过来
Come here.

123
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,872
美女，你会记得的
因为我抓你当过人质
There you go, doll.
Something to remember me by.

124
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,047
你知道不，我不干这活的时候
是个星探
You know, when I'm not doing
this, I'm a scout for the movies.

125
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
真的？
Really?

126
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,972
手放一起
Join hands.

127
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,098
我们会在这里冻死的！
We'll freeze here!

128
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,226
不，用不了10分钟你们
就能把手弄出来
No. You'll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes.

129
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,126
我们要这些干什么？
Why do we
need this?

130
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,296
因为罪犯们现在飞车四处流窜
跨州犯案
Because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines,

131
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,839
当地的执法机构管不到他们
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction

132
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,217
也没有联邦警察来阻止他们
because there is no federal
police force to stop them.

133
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,511
在我看来，你的调查局为了抓他们
By my tally, your
Bureau wants to spend

134
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,805
花掉了太多纳税人的钱
more taxpayers' dollars
catching crooks

135
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,349
比你抓到的强盗们偷走的钱还要多
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place.

136
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,393
这实在荒谬，调查局抓住的绑架犯
Well, that's ridiculous.
The Bureau has apprehended

137
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,811
和银行抢劫犯
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have

138
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,146
- 数量超过了…
- 真的？
stolen up to and in excess of... Really?

139
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,358
你抓了几个？
How many have you
apprehended?

140
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,778
我们逮捕了213个被通缉的重案犯
而且把他们送上了法庭
We have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons.

141
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
不，我是问你？
胡佛主管，你抓了几个？
No, I mean you, Director
Hoover. How many?

142
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,282
作为管理人员，我负责指挥
Well, as Director,
I administer.

143
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,452
你个人又抓了几个呢？
How many have you
arrested personally?

144
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,376
我谁都没抓过
I have never
arrested anybody.

145
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,796
你从来没有抓到过罪犯？
You've never
arrested anybody.

146
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,464
当然没有，我是个管理者
Well, of course not.
I am an administrator.

147
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,633
没有现场经验的？
With no field experience.

148
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,345
你不觉得自己非常不称职吗
You are shockingly
unqualified, aren't you, sir?

149
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,431
在你的工作生涯里，从来没有到现场
You have never
personally conducted

150
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,267
参与过罪案调查
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life.

151
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,477
我认为你空有虚名
I think you're a front.

152
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,815
你所谓执法者的形象
I think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth

153
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,610
不过是你手下做宣传的桑丹先生
用头条新闻自吹自擂出来的谎言
created from the hoopla of headlines
by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there.

154
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,864
罪案敢死队，罪恶克星
你想把自己塑造成沙皇么？
[备注:G-Men是1935年的一部电影
Goverment man，不携带武器
只拥有警察的部分权限]
Crimebusters, G-men, you're
setting yourself up as a czar?

155
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
跟我预想的大不同
That's running wild
in my estimation.

156
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,659
罪案总是出乎意料
A crime is what
runs wild.

157
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,245
如果这个国家需要像你们这样的机构
If this country requires
a Bureau such as yours,

158
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,789
对于你是否适合执掌它，我表示怀疑
I question whether you are
the person fit to run it.

159
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,418
我可不想让由一群贪财政客
私设的公堂来审判我
Well, I will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians.

160
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,879
你的增加拨款申请被否决了
Your appropriation
increase is denied.

161
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,640
把下面这些话发给沃特・温切尔
Feed the following
to Walter Winchell.

162
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:25,270
麦凯拉就是个原始人
他和我有私仇，一直想弄垮我
McKellar is a Neanderthal, and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me.

163
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,522
我们不在他的会议室里和他斗
We will not contest him
in his committee room.

164
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,483
我们要在头版头条上搞他
We will fight him
on the front page.

165
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,194
约翰・迪林杰在哪儿？
Where is John Dillinger?

166
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,455
普韦斯探员，恭喜
Agent Purvis,
congratulations.

167
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,123
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

168
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,167
- 我能问为什么恭喜我吗？
- 他们都准备好了
May I ask why?
They're ready for him.

169
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,836
这位是亨利・桑丹
他是我们公关方面的专家
This is Henry Suydam. He is
our expert in press relations.

170
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,589
首先恭喜你
关于小白脸佛洛伊德的事
Congratulations
for Pretty Boy Floyd,

171
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,925
另外，我个人要向您表示感激
for which you have
my personal gratitude.

172
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,010
然后，从现在起
Second, you are,
as of this moment,

173
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,013
你将是负责芝加哥办事处的特别探员
the Special Agent in Charge
of the Chicago field office.

174
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
你能胜任吗，普韦斯探员？
Are you up to that
task, Agent Purvis?

175
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,517
毫无疑问，先生
Absolutely, sir.

176
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
下午好，先生们
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

177
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:16,071
今天，我在此代表美利坚合众国
向众多的罪犯首次宣战
Today, I am declaring the United
States of America's first War on Crime.

178
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:22,536
请允许我向大家介绍我们最好的
执法人员之一，梅尔文・普韦斯探员
And I'd like to introduce one of our
finest G-men, Agent Melvin Purvis.

179
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
普韦斯探员将会负责芝加哥的办事处
Agent Purvis will be in charge
of the field office in Chicago,

180
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,416
这里也是席卷全美的犯罪大潮的中心
the center of the crime
wave sweeping America.

181
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,879
他的任务是抓住头号公敌
约翰・迪林杰
His task will be to get Public
Enemy Number One, John Dillinger.

182
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,340
- 长官？
- 普韦斯先生？
Director?
Mr. Purvis?

183
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,800
能不能说几句？
Say a few words,
would you?

184
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,515
普韦斯先生
你怎么搞定小白脸佛洛伊德？
Mr. Purvis, how did you
run down Pretty Boy Floyd?

185
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,019
在苹果园里
Through an apple orchard.

186
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,399
托尔森先生，等他
接受完采访后告诉他
Mr. Tolson, when he's done, you
tell him if he needs anything,

187
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,276
需要什么，就来找你
you'll get it for him.

188
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,279
还有告诉他，他可以喊我J.E
And tell him
he may call me J. E.

189
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,532
大家都说约翰・迪林杰很狡猾
很难对付
Yeah, but people say John Dillinger's
a lot smarter and a lot tougher.

190
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,201
不管怎么样，我们都会抓到他
Well, nevertheless,
we will get him.

191
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,911
你为什么这么肯定？
What makes
you so sure?

192
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,872
有两样东西
我们有，迪林杰却没有
We have two things
Dillinger does not.

193
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,039
是什么？
What are they?

194
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,002
调查局用于打击犯罪的
先进仪器和高科技
The Bureau's modern techniques
of fighting crime scientifically

195
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,795
以及我们的长官J・艾德加・胡佛
and the visionary
leadership

196
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,630
有预见性的领导才能
of our Director,
J. Edgar Hoover.

197
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,763
那妞一直在看着我
The broad over there is looking at me.

198
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,307
她喜欢我
She likes me.

199
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,183
亲爱的，你好啊？
How you doing,
sweetheart?

200
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,750
阿尔文，很高兴见到你
Alvin.
Good to see you.

201
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,084
好啊
How you doing?

202
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,461
霍莫尔，皮特
Homer. Pete.

203
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,926
我，佛莱蒂和医生想绑架一个人
Me, Freddy and Doc are
looking to snatch a fellow.

204
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,347
他叫艾德・布雷默，圣保罗银行的
我们需要帮手
He's a Saint Paul banker, Ed
Bremer. We need a few more hands.

205
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,183
我不喜欢绑架
I don't like kidnapping.

206
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,519
但是，抢银行越来越难了
Well, robbing banks
is getting tougher.

207
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,605
公众不喜欢绑架案
The public don't
like kidnapping.

208
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,732
谁他妈的管这些人喜不喜欢？
Who gives a damn
what the public likes?

209
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,567
我关心，我得混在他们中间
I do.
I hide out among them.

210
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,319
我们必须考虑他们怎么想的
We gotta care
what they think.

211
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,863
我们还盯上了一辆邮车
We also got a mail train
we're looking at, too.

212
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,451
话说，如果有人被抓了
怎么把他搞出来
By the way, if somebody was to get
pinched, who knows their way around?

213
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:32,040
联合会有个叫皮卡特的律师
路易斯・皮卡特，我们都找他
Syndicate lawyer named Piquett,
Louis Piquett. We all use him.

214
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,875
这邮车又是怎么回事？
What's it all about,
this train?

215
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,711
需要两三个机灵点的人盯着
Needs two or three more real
right guys to stick it up.

216
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,463
这两个月就准备动手
Be ready in
a couple of months.

217
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,218
大概有170万，是联邦储备
About $1,700,000. It's a
Federal Reserve shipment.

218
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,596
正好做完一票后远走高飞
It's the kind of score
you go away on after.

219
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,015
你想去哪里？
Where you gonna go?

220
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,603
不知道，巴西，古巴
我喜欢瓦拉德罗海滩
I don't know. Brazil,
Cuba. I like Varadero Beach.

221
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,480
你呢？
What about you?

222
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,565
没想过
No plans.

223
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,526
是啊，那么你可以想了
Yeah, well,
you ought to.

224
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,487
我们没法一直搞下去
What we're doing
won't last forever.

225
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,739
我们都是今朝有酒今朝醉
We're having too
good a time today.

226
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,908
从来不去想明天的破事
We ain't thinking
about tomorrow.

227
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,830
- 你记得帮我盯着火车的事，啊？
- 好
Keep me in mind on the train,
would you? All right. Thanks.

228
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,918
你知道他们为了把哈姆・布鲁利
弄出来，花了多少钱？
You know how much they made
taking that Hamm Brewery guy?

229
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,087
- 10万块
- 别激动，霍莫尔
$100,000.
Simmer down, Homer.

230
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,007
别想了，伙计，我们去酒吧
Come on, fellas.
Let's go to the bar.

231
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,009
我骗到3个小娘们
我说这地方是我开的
I got three broads
convinced I own the place.

232
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,553
再见
See you.

233
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,933
霍莫尔最近靠谱么？
Is Homer staying
steady enough?

234
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,144
霍莫尔没事
Homer's fine.

235
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,896
沃特・迪崔克让我学到了一件事
One rule I learned
from Walter Dietrich,

236
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,648
永远别和亡命之徒一起干
never work with people
who are desperate.

237
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,443
好吧，我也学到一条
别去碰女人
Yeah, well, I got a rule,
too. Stay away from the women.

238
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,490
没有了女人，和回到号子里
有什么差别
Without women, it's
like back in the stir.

239
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,701
所以他们才发明了婊子啊
That's why they
invented whores.

240
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,579
嘿，嘿，安娜
Hey, hey, Anna.

241
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,247
好啊，大个子
How are you doing,
big boy?

242
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,207
- 这是？
- 维罗尼卡
Who's this?
Veronica.

243
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,751
维罗尼卡，这是瑞德
Veronica, Red.

244
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,627
- 嗨，强尼
- 嘿，安娜
Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Anna.

245
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,069
我不知道你为什么当那家伙是空气
I don't know why you gave
that fellow the go-by,

246
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
不过我要说你做的好
but I'm awful glad
you did.

247
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,408
你叫什么？
What's your name?

248
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,618
比莉・弗莱切特
Billie Frechette.

249
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,705
我请你喝杯？
Can I buy you a drink?

250
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,915
好
Okay.

251
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,712
你有名字么？
You got a name?

252
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,549
嗯
Yeah.

253
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,511
- 杰克
- 跳舞么，杰克？
Jack.
You dance, Jack?

254
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,722
我不会
I don't know how.

255
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,058
别装了
Come on.

256
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,562
你怎么可能不懂跳舞
How come you don't
know how to dance?

257
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,856
弗莱切特
Frechette.

258
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,900
法国人？

259
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,862
嗯，我爸爸是
名字的最后有个“e”
On my father's side.
There's an "e" at the end.

260
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,864
这首是两拍子的

262
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,499
<i>有人在等我</i>

263
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,548
<i>糖很甜蜜，他也甜蜜</i>
Sugar's sweet, so is he

264
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,639
爸爸是法国人，那妈妈呢？
Daddy's French.
What's on the other side?

265
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,395
我妈妈是美浓米尼族的印第安人
My mama's
a Menominee Indian, okay?

266
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,814
大部分男人都不喜欢这血统
Most men don't like that.

267
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,484
我不是大部分
I ain't most men.

268
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,652
真的？
Yeah?

269
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,282
我当过赌场的荷官
在斯都本俱乐部保管衣服
And I've been a dice girl, and I
check coats at the Steuben Club.

270
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,080
你做什么呢？
And what do you do?

271
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,501
我是个偷心的贼
I'm catching up.

272
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,089
为了遇见像你这样的人
Meeting somebody
like you,

273
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,342
黑暗又美丽
dark and beautiful,

274
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,055
就像歌里的鸟
like that bird
in that song.

275
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:22,395
<i>黑鸟，再见</i>
Blackbird, bye-bye

276
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:28,610
<i>这里没有人能爱你</i>

277
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,532
<i>或是懂你</i>

278
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,163
你冷了？
You cold?

279
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,482
你到底是做什么的？
What is it exactly
you do for a living?

280
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,778
我是约翰・迪林杰，我抢银行
I'm John Dillinger.
I rob banks.

281
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,243
银行就是所有人都去存钱的地方
That's where all these
people here put their money.

282
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,788
你为什么要告诉我呢？
Why did you
tell me that?

283
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,958
你可以编个故事
You could have
made up a story.

284
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,584
我不会对你撒谎
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

285
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,089
对于一个刚认识的女孩来说
说这事太严肃了吧
That's a serious thing to
say to a girl you just met.

286
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,340
我了解你
I know you.

287
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,967
是吗，我了解你
Well, I don't know you.

288
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,428
我哪里也没有去过
I haven't been anyplace.

289
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,847
我以前呆的也不是什么好地方
Well, some of the places
I've been ain't so hot.

290
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,477
我要去个更好的地方
Where I'm going is
a whole lot better.

291
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,771
你要一起去吗？
Want to come along?

292
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,190
哇，你很性急啊！
Boy, you are in a hurry!

293
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,069
如果你看到我看到的东西
你也会性急的
If you were looking at what I'm
looking at, you'd be in a hurry, too.

294
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,612
好吧
Well,

295
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,615
这次，他们都在看我
it's me they're
looking at this time.

296
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,534
你很漂亮
You're beautiful.

297
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,953
他们看着我是因为
They're looking at me
because they're not used to

298
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,871
没见过有姑娘会穿3块钱的衣服
having a girl in
their restaurant

299
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,707
到他们的餐厅来
in a $3 dress.

300
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,835
听着，洋娃娃
Listen, doll.

301
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,630
那是因为他们只关心你是从哪里来的
That's 'cause they're all
about where people come from.

302
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,135
而我们要去哪里，才是唯一重要的
The only thing that's important
is where somebody's going.

303
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,513
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

304
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,225
随我想要去哪里
Anywhere I want.

305
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,735
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

306
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,582
嘿，强尼！
Hey, Johnny!

307
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,463
到外面去等我
Go wait for me outside.

308

在给弗兰克・尼蒂做事
Ever since I got out, I've
been working for Frank Nitti.

310

想到这个，我就对你很感兴趣
where you give the customers
back their money, you crack me up.

314
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,841
如果你需要什么，就找吉尔伯特
You need anything,
ask Gilbert.

315
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,551
吉尔伯特知道怎么找我

how to find me.

316
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,136
谢谢
Thank you.

317
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,113
- 那女孩跑哪里去了？
- 我不知道，先生
Where'd that girl go?
I don't know, sir.

318
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,989
她找了辆计程车，就走了
She jumped in a cab
and took off.

319
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,079

谢谢你，包姆探员
Thank you, Agent Baum.

333
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,201
全国各个办事处的人

334
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,248
都在查卖衣服的店

United States that sold this overcoat.

出售这件外套的店
Then we will cross-reference

寻找所有迪林杰相关的线索

that coat was sold.

337
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,298
他肯定是藏在哪儿了
He was in a place.

338
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,842
他得了感冒，所以买了件外套

He bought a coat.

339
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,678
除非他还在四处流窜

不然就一定躲在附近

and a.351 Winchester
semi-automatic rifle.

00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,760
我们要追捕的是棘手的杀人犯
他们很危险
We are pursuing hardened
killers. They will be dangerous.

350
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,764
你们中谁没准备好的，最好回家去
And those of you who aren't
prepared for that should go.

351
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,227
如果你们谁要走，现在就离开
And if you are going

00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,282
你走的时候把钥匙放在地板下面
When you drop it, leave
the keys on the floorboard.

356
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,535
- 我搞到辆德索托
- 很好
[备注：也是克莱斯勒的车型]
I got a DeSoto.
Okay.

357
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,203
车里面挺糟的
Interior's no good.

358
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,955
我们怎么去找这个伯曼？
How did we get
to Berman?

359
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,331
从迪林杰的外套入手
Off the Dillinger coat.

360
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,083
衣服是在伊利诺伊州的西西洛买的
The coat was bought
in Cicero, lllinois,

361
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,460
离伯曼的店没多远
a few doors down from
Berman's dealership.

362
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:23,381
我们调查过伯曼
从卡彭时代起，他就给联合会提供车辆
[卡彭：20世纪初期美国纽约黑帮老大]
Now, we know Berman. He's been supplying
cars to the Syndicate since Capone.

363
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,258
迪林杰肯定是趁在伯曼那里换车的时候
When Dillinger
bought that coat,

364
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,218
买了件衣服
he must have been at
Berman's switching cars.

365
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,012
他们下次打电话交易车子的时候
我们就跟上
As soon as they call to drop
the DeSoto, we'll tail it.

366
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,974
找人轮流监视
I want men on this
around the clock.

367
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,735
先生，需要帮您存衣服吗？
May I check
your coat, sir?

368
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,028
好的，谢谢
Yes, thank you.

369
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,156
你逃走了
You ran out on me.

370
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,033
是你把我丢在街边
You left me standing
on the sidewalk.

371
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,577
如果你要当我的女人
If you're
gonna be my girl,

372
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,913
就发誓绝对不会再这么一走了之
you're gonna have to swear to me
that you'll never ever do that again.

373
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,207
- 嘿，我才不是你的女人
- 棕色的外套
Hey, I'm not your girl.
Brown overcoat.

374
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,584
我才不会答应你呢
And I'm not
gonna say that.

375
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,752
- 我等你说
- 我也在等
I'm waiting.
So am I.

376
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,131
“我再也不会从你身边跑掉”照着说
"I'm never gonna run out on
you ever again. " Say the words.

377
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,924
- 不说
- 我的衣服
No.
My coat.

378
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,218
好吧，那我保证
我绝对不会离开你
Well, I ain't ever gonna run
out on you, and that's a promise.

379
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,554
但是我现在要走
所以，女士…
Well, I want to run
out of here, so, lady...

380
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,824
滚吧，老兄，不用小费了
Hit the road, sport.
Keep the tip.

381
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,787
你再也不用帮人递衣服帽子了
You ain't getting other people's
hats and coats no more neither.

382
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,122
你要干吗？
Why'd you do that?

383
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,957
因为现在你跟我了
'Cause you're with me now.

384
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,084
但是我根本不了解你
I don't know
anything about you.

385
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,795
我在印第安纳州的穆尔斯维尔长大
I was raised on a farm
in Mooresville, Indiana.

386
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,005
我3岁的时候妈妈死了
My mama died
when I was three.

387
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,634
我爸不知道怎样养小孩
只知道狠命地揍我
My daddy beat the hell out of me 'cause
he didn't know no better way to raise me.

388
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:54,972
我喜欢棒球，看电影，高档衣服
靓车，威士忌，还有你
I like baseball, movies, good
clothes, fast cars, whiskey and you.

389
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,975
你还要知道什么？
What else
you need to know?

390
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,429
坐吧
Have a seat.

391
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,392
你住在这里很久了？
You been living here long?

392
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,643
对
Yeah.

393
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,603
昨天开始
Since yesterday.

394
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,900
嘿
Hey.

395
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,122
我给你准备了些东西
I got you something.

396
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,018
我还是小女孩的时候
BILLIE: When I was a girl,

397
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,604
我们住在弗兰德利的福利院里
we went to live on the
reservation in Flandreau

398
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,522
因为我爸爸死了
'cause my daddy died.

399
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,277
在弗兰德利，什么事情都没发生
In Flandreau,
nothing ever happened.

400
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,782
13岁之后我去了密尔沃基
和我的姑姑伊恩丝住
And when I was 13, I went to live
in Milwaukee with my Aunt Ines.

401
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,203
我们有很多的印第安朋友
We had a lot of
Indian friends,

402
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,165
我们一起去教堂，一起演出
and we went around to
churches and put on plays.

403
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,712
不过那里也没什么有趣的事发生
And nothing exciting ever
happened there, either.

404
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,801
所以除了想到芝加哥来
过自己生活外
So I haven't been anywhere or done
anything except come to Chicago

405
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,720
我哪里都没去过
也没有经历过什么大事
and try to make my way.

406
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,161
你把行李都打包了
You're all packed.

407
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,544
宝贝
Well, baby,

408
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,967
我会带上你
I'm gonna
take you with me.

409
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,057
你将会过上全新的精彩生活
And you're gonna start a whole
new exciting kind of life.

410
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,898
你想要什么？
And what do you want?

411
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,112
一切
Everything.

412
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,658
就现在
Right now.

413
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,708
我是普韦斯
Purvis.

414
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,086
20分钟前，伯曼把德索托
停在了施隆公寓前
Berman dropped the DeSoto at
Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago.

415
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,757
租给一位薇・史考特小姐的
房间里有人进出
Men go in and out of an apartment
rented to a Miss Vi Scott.

416
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,344
他们都提着很重的手提箱
有个人看起来很像迪林杰
They carry heavy suitcases. One
of them looks like Dillinger.

417
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,395
你的人在哪里？
Where are your men?

418
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,564
在卡兰多和威尔森大街
都在车里
In cars on Clarendon
and Wilson Avenue.

419
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,149
拦截的车呢？巷子里没人管？
Blocking vehicles?
The alley?

420
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,444
有人盯着那辆德索托么？
Who has a line of sight
on the DeSoto to you?

421
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,621
他们知道我们在这儿吗？
有什么可疑行动吗？
Are they aware that we are
here? Any rapid movements?

422
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,830
没有
No.

423
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,167
卡特
Carter,

424
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,421
你到那里去，看着那辆车
you keep an eye on
the DeSoto from there.

425
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,843
巴顿，你跟我走
Barton, you're with me.

426
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,792
什么事？
Yes?

427
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,380
史考特小姐
我是特别探员梅尔文・普韦斯
I'm Special Agent Melvin
Purvis, Miss Scott.

428
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,173
你一个人？
Are you here
by yourself?

429
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,467
不是，和我的未婚夫一起
No. I'm here
with my fiancé.

430
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,969
你未婚夫的名字是？
And what is
your fiancé's name?

431
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,096
莱纳德・麦克亨利
Leonard McHenry.

432
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,641
我们可以进去吗？
May we come in?

433
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,809
好的，请进
Well, please.

434
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,769
我很安全，不过都请进来吧
I'm perfectly safe,
but come on in.

435
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,316
怎么了？
Something wrong?

436
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,819
你有证件吗？
You have identification?

437
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,530
有，当然有
Yeah, sure.

438
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,617
亲爱的，能帮我拿驾驶证过来吗？
在我夹克的口袋
Honey, would you get my driver's
license? It's in my jacket pocket.

439
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,743
没问题
Sure.

440
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,121
我认识你
I know you.

441
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,289
你是…
You're...

442
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,792
你是梅尔文・普韦斯，对吧
You're Melvin Purvis.
Right?

443
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,295
没错，我见过你的照片
Yeah. I seen your picture.

444
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,882
莱纳德，你是做什么工作的？
And what do you do
for a living, Leonard?

445
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,968
我卖女人鞋子
I travel
in ladies' shoes.

446
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,679
亲爱的，给他看看
Show him, honey.

447
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,849
很可爱的鞋子，是吧
Cute, huh?

448
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,606
请你们继续享用晚餐吧
麦克亨利先生
Well, you enjoy the rest
of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.

449
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,734
- 谢谢
- 晚安
Thanks.
Good night.

450
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,662
不准任何人进出
我去叫其他人，你留在这里
No one in or out. I'll get
the others. You stay here.

451
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,123
你就在这里看着那扇门
You watch that door
from right there.

452
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,756
把喜来登那边的人叫来
Get the men
from Sheridan.

453
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,663
调查局，你叫什么名字？
Bureau of Investigation.
What's your name?

454
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,666
你要知道我的名字？
You wanna know
my name?

455
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,176
走吧
Come on.

456
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,388
包姆，你盯着巷子
Baum, you keep an eye
on the alley.

457
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,401
巴顿？
Barton?

458
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,446
巴顿
Barton.

459
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,988
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

460
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,584
他们朝东边去了！
They're headed east!

461
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,752
谁在拦截车里的？
Who was in
the blocking car?

462
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,171
是我们
That was us.

463
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,092
我们听到有枪声，就赶过来了
We heard gunfire
so we came here.

464
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,638
是谁？迪林杰？
Who was it?
Dillinger?

465
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,020
我们放跑的不是迪林杰
The man we let get away
wasn't John Dillinger.

466
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,063
是娃娃脸尼尔森
That was Baby Face Nelson.

467
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,841
趴到地板上！现在过去！
Get on the floor!
Now! Go!

468
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,301
你们都起来，靠墙站
Y'all get up
against that wall.

469
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,428
都站过去，你们所有人，这是抢劫！
Go on, all of you. PIERPONT:
This is a stick-up! Up!

470
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,388
把手举起来！
Put them up! Up!

471
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,015
趴下，现在，都趴好
Down on the floor,
now! Down!

472
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,600
把钱拿出来！快点！拿出来！
Put them up! Come on.
Put them up!

473
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,101
这是抢劫！
This is a stick-up!

474
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,145
快走，快点！手举高！
Let's go. Come on.
Up!

475
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,855
举高，让我看到！
Where I can
see them, up!

476
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,484
顾客们，请冷静，不要动
Customers, stay calm.
Don't move.

477
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,153
嘿！你！手举起来！
Hey! You! Up!

478
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,824
- 手举起来！
- 快点！拿走！
Hands up!
Move! Empty it!

479
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,662
约翰・迪林杰从银行抢走了7万4千块
John Dillinger held up
a bank for $74,000

480
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,956
而你连尼尔森都没抓住
while you failed
to arrest Nelson.

481
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,166
长官，我会负全部责任的
Sir, I take
full responsibility.

482
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,586
我还想提个要求
And I would like
to make a request.

483
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,506
我希望能够调些有能力的人
That we transfer men with
special qualifications

484
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,508
把芝加哥这里的人手换掉
to augment the staff
here in Chicago.

485
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,593
有些原来在德克萨斯
和俄克拉荷马做事的
There are some former
Texas and Oklahoma lawmen

486
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,887
现在在达拉斯那边
currently with
the Bureau in Dallas.

487
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,015
你应该知道我要组建什么样的队伍
I thought you understood
what I'm building.

488
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,644
一支最好的，年轻的，专业精英队伍
A modern force of professional
young men of the best sort.

489
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,481
恐怕现在手上的人没法搞定这活
I'm afraid our type
cannot get the job done.

490
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,650
什么？我听不见你说什么？
Excuse me,
I cannot hear you.

491
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,611
我们的人搞不定
Our type cannot
get the job done.

492
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,071
我听不清
I cannot hear you.

493
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,741
我们的人办不成这事
Our type cannot
get the job done.

494
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,202
如果没有合适的人手帮忙
Without qualified help,

495
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,746
我就只能向你辞职了
I would have to resign
this appointment.

496
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,124
不然的话，我的人
会被杀地一干二净
Otherwise, I am leading
my men to slaughter.

497
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,671
托尔森先生会打电话通知你的
普韦斯先生
Mr. Tolson will call you,
Agent Purvis.

498
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,077
他有没有说他长什么样？
Did he say what
he looked like?

499
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,370
没有说
Didn't say.

500
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,496
先生们需要帮忙吗？
You gentlemen
need any help?

501
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,664
谢谢你，不用
Thank you, no.

502
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,390
- 擦亮点
- 早上好
WINSTEAD: Shine?
Morning.

503
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,434
- 你好吗？
- 我挺好
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.

504
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,564
文斯特探员？
Agent Winstead?

505
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,941
- 没错
- 很高兴能帮忙
That's right.
It's a pleasure.

506
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,071
欢迎来到芝加哥，我们有很多事要做
为了抓住迪林杰先生
Welcome to Chicago. We have a lot
of work to do here on Mr. Dillinger.

507
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,947
下一次擦吧
好的，先生，谢谢，先生
Another time.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

508
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,240
祝你今天愉快
Have a nice day.

509
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,973
把强尼・帕顿放到其它四道的前面去
Put Johnny Patton down front
on the other four tracks.

510
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,103
外面很热，是吧？
It's hot out, right?

511
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,604
是啊，弗兰克
Yes, Frank.

512
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,524
上次被那群白痴打中以后
我就再也没有热的感觉了
Ever since those pricks
shot me, I can't get warm.

513
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,403
什么事？
What?

514
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,279
芝加哥来了些人
Some people from
Chicago over there.

515
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,373
强尼
Johnny.

516
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,834
我们25号在图克松碰头
你看怎么样？
What do you say we meet you
in Tucson around the 25th?

517
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,502
- 好的
- 那好
Okay.
All right.

518
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,712
今天我在印第安纳报纸上看到的
I heard one today.
Indiana paper,

519
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,966
通缉约翰・迪林杰
要死的，或者是尸体
"Wanted, John Dillinger,
dead or dead. "

520
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,639
这阵子，我们要让中西部的
条子受累了
I think we wore out
the Midwest for a while.

521
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,228
怎么了？
What?

522
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,940
今晚上来殖民地酒店
是我们自己的店，别客气
Come out to the Colonial tonight.
It's our joint. Be my guest.

523
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,276
有迈阿密最好的牛排
The best steaks in Miami.

524
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,945
你不会要给我们拍照吧？
You're not gonna
take our picture, are you?

525
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,697
不拍照
No pictures.

526
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,198
好，我们会到的
All right.
We'll be there.

527
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,077
谢谢你带我一起旅行
Thank you for taking me
on this trip.

528
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,664
你要去别的地方？洋娃娃
我说对了？
You going somewhere,
doll? Am I?

529
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,584
- 没有
- 别朝骗子撒谎
No.
Don't kid a kidder.

530
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,794
那就不要再耍我
Then don't play me
for a fool.

531
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,881
到最后我肯定还会回斯都本俱乐部
帮人存衣服，我们都清楚
We both know I end up back
checking coats at the Steuben Club,

532
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,299
明摆着的
one way or the other.

533
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,675
什么意思？
What does that mean?

534
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,304
你从来不去想将来
You don't think past today
or tomorrow. And eventually,

535
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,972
他们迟早会抓住你，或者杀了你
they will catch you
or kill you

536
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,516
我不希望亲眼看到这一幕
and I don't want to be
there when that happens.

537
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,935
谁给了你预测未来的水晶球么？
Who gave you
a crystal ball?

538
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,812
我不需要
I don't need one.

539
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,272
去问霍莫尔
Ask Homer.

540
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,232
问霍莫尔什么？
Ask Homer what?

541
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,902
还有他那个该死的笑话
“死的，或者是尸体”
And his goddamn joke,
"dead or dead. "

542
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,910
你哪里都不准去，听见了吗？
You ain't going nowhere,
you hear me?

543
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,370
我会在你的怀里老死的
I'm gonna die an old man
in your arms.

544
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,372
我们比他们强太多了
We're too good for them.

545
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,709
他们不够胆，不够聪明
手脚也不够快
They ain't tough enough,
smart enough or fast enough.

546
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,337
我随时都能去抢银行，随便挑个
I hit any bank
I want any time.

547
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,632
他们却要一直守着所有的银行
They got to be at
every bank all the time.

548
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,052
所以我们才是最厉害的
That's why we're
on top of the world.

549
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,638
没有人能挡住我们
Ain't nobody
lay a glove on us.

550
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,681
没有人
No.

551
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:36,353
我哪里都不去，你也不准去
I ain't going nowhere.
Neither are you.

552
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,939
你觉得怎样？
What do you got
to say about that?

553
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,934
嗨，老兄
Hi, folks.

554
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,771
下午好
弗兰克・萨利文夫妇，有预定
Afternoon. Got a reservation for
a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan.

555
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,112
如果你们喜欢的话
我们可以提供三明治和啤酒
I can send up some sandwiches
and beer if you like.

556
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,488
再好不过了
That'd be swell.

557
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,574
我有些朋友应该到这里了
Some friends of mine
should be here already,

558
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,659
J.C.戴维斯
还有一位克拉克先生
a J.C. Davies
and a Mr. Clark?

559
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,036
我想他们大概出去买东西了
Out shopping, I believe.

560
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,621
他们回来的时候，我会告诉说你来了
I'll let them know you're
in when they get back.

561
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:37,831
好，就这么办
Okey-doke.

562
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,419
电梯朝那边走
The elevator's
right down that way.

563
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,962
谢谢
Thank you very much.

564
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,415
看起来你很需要有人陪啊
You look like you
could use some company.

565
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,170
我和我朋友阿尔伯特王子
能进去坐坐吗？
How's about me and my friend Prince
Albert come and pay you a visit?

566
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,507
你们两个，都请进来吧
Get on in here,
both of you.

567
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:42,145
强尼！强尼！
BILLIE: Johnny! Johnny!

568
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,275
小姐，请穿上衣服
Put some clothes on, miss.

569
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,115
弟兄们，出什么事情了？
What the hell
happened, boys?

570
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,660
宾馆起火了
There was a fire
in the hotel.

571
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,165
消防员发现了我们的枪
他们叫了条子
Firemen found our guns.
They called the cops.

572
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,291
他们带你去哪里？
Where they taking you?

573
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,876
他们要把我们送去俄亥俄州
We're getting
shanghaied to Ohio.

574
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,086
比莉人呢？
Where's Billie?

575
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,014
你的女人坐上巴士回芝加哥了
Your girl's been put on
a bus back to Chicago.

576
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,849
我们不准备关押她
We ain't holding her.

577
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,455
这边
Right this way.

578
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,759
哟
Well,

579
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,306
这不是干掉小白脸佛洛伊德的人么
here's the man who
killed Pretty Boy Floyd.

580
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,811
幸亏他只是帅而已，对吧
可惜他不叫聪明人佛洛伊德
Damn good thing he was pretty,
'cause he sure wasn't Whiz Kid Floyd.

581
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,485
实话告诉我，普韦斯先生
Tell me something,
Mr. Purvis.

582
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,156
那个家伙，死在施隆公寓的那个
That fellow, the one who got
killed at the Sherone Apartments,

583
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,327
报纸说你发现他的时候，人还活着
the newspaper said
you found him alive.

584
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,416
你能感觉到吧
It's the eyes,
ain't it?

585
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,587
他的眼睛一直在背后盯着你
They look at you
right before they go.

586
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,178
然后突然消失无踪
And then they just
drift away into nothing.

587
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,809
在你熬夜的时候一定帮了不少忙吧
That'll keep
you up nights.

588
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,856
你晚上不睡又靠得什么呢
迪林杰先生？
And what keeps you up
nights, Mr. Dillinger?

589
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,695
咖啡
Coffee.

590
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,079
你表现地像个很有自信的人
普韦斯先生
You act like a confident
man, Mr. Purvis.

591
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,706
你有点本事
You got a few qualities.

592
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,459
也许你远程指挥起来是很不错
Probably pretty good
from a distance,

593
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,961
特别是你人多势众
especially when you got
the fellow outnumbered.

594
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,713
但如果是面对面来斗一场
But up close,
toe to toe,

595
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,383
不死不休，就不好说了
when somebody's about to
die right here, right now,

596
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,888
我早就习惯这种场面了
I'm used to that.

597
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,724
你呢？
What about you?

598
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,060
再见，迪林杰先生
Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.

599
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,854
我们外面见
I'll see you
down the road.

600
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,692
不，你见不到了
No, you will not.

601
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,072
你离开监狱的唯一方式
The only way that you
will leave a jail cell

602
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,616
就是他们带你去处刑
is when we take you out
to execute you.

603
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,454
是么，我们走着瞧吧
Well, we'll see
about that.

604
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:52,001
你该给自己再找份工作了，梅尔文
You ought to get yourself
another line of work, Melvin.

605
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,139
嘿，我只是开玩笑
Hey, I was just kidding.

606
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,309
我就让你们再多关我几天
I believe I'm gonna let you
boys keep me here a while.

607
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,398
我们很乐意这么做，强尼
但是不要太得意了
We'd like that, Johnny, but
don't get too comfortable.

608
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,483
他们准备遣送你
They're moving you.

609
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,568
去哪里？
Where to?

610
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,944
印第安纳
Indiana.

611
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,655
为什么？
Why?

612
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,617
我和印第安纳可没有什么感情呢
I have absolutely nothing
I want to do in Indiana.

613
00:55:58,476 --> 00:55:59,643
他到了
He's here.

614
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:07,609
让开，伙计们，退后
Back up, fellas.
Back up.

615
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:16,160
现在交给我们吧
把镣铐去掉
We'll take custody now.
Take the manacles off.

616
00:56:24,169 --> 00:56:25,586
再见到印第安纳，你高兴吗？
Are you glad
to see Indiana again?

617
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,588
我猜，就像印第安纳
很高兴见到我一样
About as glad as Indiana
is to see me, I suppose.

618
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:31,091
你是不是把枪偷偷弄进了
印第安纳州立监狱
Did you smuggle the guns into
Indiana State Penitentiary

619
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:32,926
策划了9月26日的越狱
for the big break
of September 26th?

620
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,179
伙计，你好奇心太重了
Right now, you're
too inquisitive, buddy.

621
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:37,431
来，搂住迪林杰
Put your arm
around Dillinger.

622
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:43,687
嘿，上次你待在穆尔斯维尔
是什么时候？
Hey, when was the last time
you were in Mooresville?

623
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:45,981
10年前吧
Ten years ago.

624
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:50,527
我是个冲动的小子
还有，大概还很傻
I was a wild boy, and,
well, I was foolish.

625
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:52,529
我抢了一家杂货店
I held up a grocery store,

626
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:55,866
我真不该那么干的
因为摩根先生是个好人
which I never should have done
'cause Mr. Morgan was a good man.

627
00:56:56,576 --> 00:57:01,038
就因为偷了50块，他们判了我10年
把我关进了州立监狱
And they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a $50 theft.

628
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,835
在监狱里的时候我碰到很多好兄弟
When I was in prison,
I met a lot of good fellows.

629
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:08,962
所以
So sure, yeah,

630
00:57:09,923 --> 00:57:12,674
我帮他们策划了密歇根市的越狱
为什么不呢？
I helped set up the break
at Michigan City. Why not?

631
00:57:13,218 --> 00:57:15,719
我和我的弟兄们，秤不离砣
I stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me.

632
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:18,764
强尼，你抢一家银行要多久？
Johnny, how long does it
take you to go through a bank?

633
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:23,769
哦，大概1分40秒吧
Oh, about one minute,
40 seconds.

634
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:24,812
精确地说
Flat.

635
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:27,981
我们走
Let's go.

636
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:51,296
强尼先生，你的律师来了
Mr. Johnny,
your lawyer's here.

637
00:58:07,939 --> 00:58:10,899
阿尔文・卡佩斯向我大力推荐你
You come highly
recommended by Alvin Karpis.

638
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,695
等到传讯的时候
At the arraignment,

639
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:17,990
他们准备把我转去州立监狱
they're gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen.

640
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:20,909
你能为我做什么？
What can you do for me?

641
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:23,161
你脑子里想的是什么？
What's on your mind?

642
00:58:24,747 --> 00:58:26,123
电椅
The electric chair.

643
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,806
法官大人，我国的法律可曾允许
在传讯中出现如此赤裸裸的偏见么？
Your Honor, are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation

644
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:47,477
或者说，这是州政府
刻意要营造的氛围？
or is the State to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice?

645
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:51,857
这里的空气中弥漫着憎恨
以及令人不堪忍受的恶意
The very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice!

646
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:55,569
这些叮当作响的镣铐让我想起了
The clanging of shackles
brings to our minds

647
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:57,237
沙皇时代的地牢
the dungeons of the czars,

648
00:58:57,322 --> 00:59:00,240
而不是自由旗帜飘扬的美国法庭
not the flag-bedecked liberty
of an American courtroom.

649
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:03,702
我请求法庭批准，立即取下这些镣铐
I request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith.

650
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:05,746
这是个非常危险的人物
法官大人
This is a very dangerous
man, Your Honor.

651
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,623
我需要对这个囚犯的安全负责
And I'm responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner.

652
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:11,084
你是律师吗？
你有什么权力去指使法庭？
Are you a lawyer? What right do
you have to address this court?

653
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:14,963
好了，将囚犯的镣铐取走
All right. Remove the
shackles from the prisoner.

654
00:59:15,506 --> 00:59:18,926
法官大人，我们希望
更改囚犯的关押地点
Your Honor, we would like
to relocate the prisoner.

655
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,386
只有密歇根市的州立监狱
Only Indiana State
Penitentiary in Michigan City

656
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,889
才能够保证迪林杰不会越狱逃走
can guarantee
Dillinger will not escape.

657
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:25,641
- 霍莉治安官，你认为呢？
- 法官大人，我同意
Sheriff Holley?
I concur, Your Honor.

658
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:28,894
霍莉治安官，我觉得你那里的
监狱也很不错
Sheriff Holley, I think this is a
very nice jail you have right here.

659
00:59:28,978 --> 00:59:31,104
是哪里让你觉得不妥了？
What makes you think there's
something wrong with it?

660
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:32,648
我的监狱没有问题
There's nothing
wrong with my jail.

661
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:34,149
那是印第安纳最坚固最严密的监狱
It's the strongest jail
in Indiana.

662
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:35,984
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

663
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:38,904
当然了，我不是想让霍莉女士难堪
But of course, I don't want
to embarrass Mrs. Holley.

664
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:41,949
我理解，她是位女性
她害怕越狱的发生
I appreciate she's a woman
and she's afraid of an escape.

665
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:43,867
哦，不不，我不是害怕越狱发生
Oh, no. I'm not afraid
of an escape.

666
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:47,079
我可以接收约翰・迪林杰
或者其他罪犯
I can take care of John
Dillinger or any other prisoner.

667
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,749
很好
Okay.

668
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:52,834
迪林杰将会待在这里
Dillinger will stay here.

669
00:59:52,919 --> 00:59:54,378
谢谢你，法官大人
PIQUETT: Thank you,
Your Honor.

670
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:57,673
我们需要4个月的时间准备辩护
The defense will need four
months to prepare itself.

671
00:59:57,757 --> 00:59:59,549
最多给你10天
It should take 10 days.

672
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:02,928
10天后开庭，可以认定这位律师
是想滥用私刑
To go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad.

673
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:04,262
法律严禁滥用私刑
There's a law
against lynching.

674
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,514
法律同样制裁谋杀！
There's a law
against murder!

675
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:07,391
那你就好好去读读法典吧
Then observe
the law part.

676
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:10,978
或者干脆让迪林杰站到墙那边去
Or just stand Dillinger
up against a wall

677
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:13,772
打死他，朝他开枪就是了
and shoot him.
Just shoot him.

678
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:16,692
那样的话，就不用浪费国家的钱
来耍这场猴戏了
Then there's no need to throw away
the State's money on this mockery.

679
01:00:16,776 --> 01:00:18,193
肃静
Calm down.

680
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,779
我向庭上道歉
I apologize to the court.

681
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:23,907
我和鲍勃很尊敬彼此
Bob and I respect
each other very much.

682
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:28,078
鲍勃你当心噢，要不然他就准备
跟你勾肩搭背了
Watch out or he'll be putting
his arm around you, too.

683
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:32,874
3月12日，一个月之后开庭
Trial starts in one
month on March 12th.

684
01:00:37,672 --> 01:00:38,964
律师先生，干得漂亮
Attaboy, counselor.

685
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:19,004
开门
Open the gate.

686
01:01:27,555 --> 01:01:28,805
嘿，卡洪！
Hey, Cahoon!

687
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:32,809
你过来下
Come here a minute.

688
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,523
过来，萨姆
Come on, Sam.

689
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:41,026
我们找个地方谈谈
You and me's going places.

690
01:01:47,825 --> 01:01:49,284
喊布赖恩特过来
Call Bryant.

691
01:01:50,495 --> 01:01:51,661
布赖恩特？
Bryant?

692
01:02:04,509 --> 01:02:05,675
叫麦克斯
Call Max.

693
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:08,720
乱来我就干掉你，别以为我不敢
I'll kill you if I have
to. Don't think I won't.

694
01:02:11,182 --> 01:02:12,349
开门！
Open up!

695
01:02:52,598 --> 01:02:54,182
当心我捅死他
I'll plug him right here.

696
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:02,315
打开枪械库，快点，打开！
Open the gun safe.
Go on. Open it up!

697
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:20,234
把监狱长关起来
Lock up the warden.

698
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,986
这不是真的吧
That wasn't real, was it?

699
01:03:28,285 --> 01:03:29,494
我们走
Let's go.

700
01:03:52,226 --> 01:03:53,267
把手举起来
Put your hands up!

701
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:55,269
哪辆车最快？
Which one of these
here cars is the fastest?

702
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:57,814
那边的福特，装了最新的V8引擎
That would be that Ford right
there. It's got the new V-8.

703
01:03:57,898 --> 01:03:59,732
我们就挑那辆，走吧
We're gonna take
that one. Go on.

704
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,822
那是莉莉安・霍莉治安官的私人用车
That's Sheriff Lillian
Holley's personal car.

705
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:07,031
正好
Good.

706
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,616
扬布拉德先生，我们没被跟踪吧？
Mr. Youngblood,
are we clear now?

707
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:34,368
没有
We are.

708
01:05:47,382 --> 01:05:48,633
好吧，接下来
Okay, then.

709
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:51,802
哦，别这样，老兄
Oh, come on, buddy.

710
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:56,390
你需要放松一下，不要紧张
You gotta relax a little
bit. Just take it easy.

711
01:05:56,475 --> 01:05:59,644
你还记不记得“最后的围捕”的歌词？
[备注，20世纪30年代的热门西部歌曲
描述捕猎小牛的场景]
Do you know the words
to The Last Round-Up?

712
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:03,439
小牛，快点跑
Get along,
little dogies

713
01:06:03,523 --> 01:06:05,358
快点跑，快点跑
Get along, get along

714
01:06:05,442 --> 01:06:08,152
小牛，快点跑，快点跑
Get along, little dogies
Get along

715
01:06:08,654 --> 01:06:12,740
小牛，快点跑，快点跑，快点跑
Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along

716
01:06:13,492 --> 01:06:15,993
小牛，快点跑，快点跑
Get along, little dogies
Get along

717
01:06:17,663 --> 01:06:21,832
我要去参加最后的围捕
I'm a-headed for
the last round-up

718
01:06:22,918 --> 01:06:24,794
他是什么表现？很开心？
How did he act?
Was he jolly?

719
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:26,671
在路上他还唱歌
Yes. He sang
part of the way.

720
01:06:27,923 --> 01:06:32,677
小牛，快点跑，快点跑，快点跑
Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along

721
01:06:33,178 --> 01:06:36,097
今天，在华盛顿，罗斯福总统说
While in Washington today,
President Roosevelt said,

722
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:37,807
“约翰・迪林杰愚弄了
"John Dillinger
is making a mockery

723
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:40,184
这个国家的司法体系”
"of the system of justice
in this country. "

724
01:06:40,894 --> 01:06:44,438
纽约巨人队的经理
约翰.J.麦克格劳去世
The passing of John J. McGraw, long-time
manager of the New York Giants...

725
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:55,866
- 你好
- 嘿，洋娃娃，是我
Hello.
Hey, doll, it's me.

726
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:57,743
听着，我不能讲太久，你还好么？
Look, I can't talk long.
You okay?

727
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:58,869
嗯
Yeah.

728
01:06:58,954 --> 01:07:01,455
我听见电台里说的了，你怎么样？
I heard it on the radio.
How about you?

729
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:03,291
我很好，很不错
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

730
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:05,710
别来芝加哥，强尼
Don't come
to Chicago, Johnny.

731
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:08,379
这话是什么意思？
What's that
supposed to mean?

732
01:07:09,381 --> 01:07:10,923
我发誓要照顾你的，不是吗？
I promised I'd look
after you, didn't I?

733
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:12,216
嗯
Yes.

734
01:07:12,301 --> 01:07:13,592
很好，这就是我要做的
Well, then that's
what I'm gonna do.

735
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:16,637
我说到做到，你应该知道？
You know that,
don't you?

736
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:18,055
嗯
Yes.

737
01:07:20,058 --> 01:07:21,934
听着，我猜他们在监视我
Look, I think
they're watching me.

738
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:25,813
我会过去把你救出来，然后照顾你
I'm gonna come get you out
of there and take care of you.

739
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:28,441
宝贝，别来芝加哥
Baby, don't come
to Chicago!

740
01:07:28,525 --> 01:07:29,775
说你知道了
Say you know it.

741
01:07:33,155 --> 01:07:34,572
跟我说
Say it.

742
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:39,493
我知道你会照顾我的
I know you will
take care of me.

743
01:07:43,582 --> 01:07:44,665
我爱你
I love you.

744
01:08:07,356 --> 01:08:09,106
早晚
Sooner or later,

745
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:12,109
她会去找他的
she will go to him

746
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:15,446
或者他回来看她
or he is gonna
come for her.

747
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,469
- 史波特！
- 强尼先生，你最好呆在那里
Say, Sport! Mr. Johnny, you
got to hold it right there.

748
01:08:43,392 --> 01:08:45,935
你不能再来这里了，强尼先生
Can't stay here
no more, Mr. Johnny.

749
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:50,231
谁说的？
Says who?

750
01:08:50,315 --> 01:08:53,317
史波特只是听命行事，我也是
Sport's only following
orders. So am I.

751
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:55,569
他们觉得你可能会来这里
They thought
you might come here.

752
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:57,822
我没懂
I don't get it.

753
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:00,408
去问你的兄弟吉尔伯特吧
Talk to your
pal Gilbert.

754
01:09:00,492 --> 01:09:01,826
问什么？
About what?

755
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:04,245
你得去和吉尔伯特・卡廷纳谈
You gotta talk
to Gilbert Catena.

756
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:19,677
过来，过来，都滚出去！
都闪开，滚！
Come on. Come on, get out
of here! Beat it! Scram!

757
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:23,347
竟然没人欢迎我回来
The welcome mat
was not out.

758
01:09:23,432 --> 01:09:26,183
他们一直让我来找你
现在，我来找你
I kept hearing your name.
Now, I'm going to ask you once.

759
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:28,519
我只问一遍
And I just did.

760
01:09:51,668 --> 01:09:53,127
有人看到他进来了吗？
Anybody see him come in?

761
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:54,420
我想没有
I don't think so.

762
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:06,348
你不是想知道我们有没带枪吗？
You want to know
if we're armed?

763
01:10:07,476 --> 01:10:08,726
我们带了
We're armed.

764
01:10:11,897 --> 01:10:13,105
冷静
Calm down.

765
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,942
冷静，冷静
Calm down. Calm down.

766
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:20,362
嘿，都回去做事
Hey, back to work.

767
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,408
怎么说，菲尔？
What's the deal, Phil?

768
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:26,494
看看周围，你看到什么了？
Look around.
What do you see?

769
01:10:27,746 --> 01:10:28,829
一大堆的电话
A whole bunch
of telephones.

770
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:29,955
你应该看到钱
You see money.

771
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:32,917
上个月开始，有人开始
提供私人连线服务
Last month, there were
independent wire services

772
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:36,670
告诉下注的人
运动员跑马场的第三场比赛谁赢了
letting bookies know who won the
third race at Sportsman's Park,

773
01:10:36,755 --> 01:10:41,091
本来全国上下有300多家干这个的
现在只有我们一家了
300 of them nationwide.
Now there's only one, ours.

774
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:44,678
10月23号的时候
你在印第安纳的绿堡抢劫了一家银行
On October 23rd, you robbed a
bank in Greencastle, Indiana.

775
01:10:44,763 --> 01:10:47,640
你带走了74802块
You got away
with $74,802.

776
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:49,683
你觉得大赚了一笔
You thought that
was a big score.

777
01:10:49,768 --> 01:10:51,727
这些电话每天都能赚这么多
These phones
make that every day.

778
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:55,356
今天，明天，后天
And it keeps getting made,
day after day after day,

779
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,859
源源不断的钱啊，而且会越赚越多
a river of money, and
it gets deeper and wider,

780
01:10:58,944 --> 01:11:03,239
每一周，每一个月
装进我们的口袋里
week in and week out, month in
and month out, flowing right to us.

781
01:11:07,452 --> 01:11:09,411
除非有条子进来
Unless the cops
come through that door.

782
01:11:09,496 --> 01:11:11,455
但是你收买了条子
让他们离这里远点
Which you pay them
not to do.

783
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:12,998
没错
Right.

784
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:16,335
除非你在附近出现
Unless you're around.

785
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:19,255
那样的话，给多少钱他们也会冲进来
Then they gotta come through
that door no matter what.

786
01:11:19,339 --> 01:11:20,673
你明白意思了？
What does that tell you?

787
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:22,007
我大受欢迎
I'm popular.

788
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:25,219
就是说你很坏事
It tells us you're
bad for business.

789
01:11:26,304 --> 01:11:28,389
所以联合会现在有新制度了
So the Syndicate's
got a new policy.

790
01:11:29,099 --> 01:11:33,102
卡佩斯，尼尔森，坎贝尔
像你们这样的人
All the guys like you,
Karpis, Nelson, Campbell,

791
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:37,022
我们不会帮你洗钱了
也不想再有来往
we ain't laundering your
money or bonds no more.

792
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:39,400
你也别想再躲到我们的妓院里去
You ain't holing up in
our whorehouses anymore.

793
01:11:39,484 --> 01:11:44,822
没装备，没医生，没避难所
毛都没有，你懂了没？
No armorers, no doctors, no safe
havens, no nothing. You get it?

794
01:11:51,204 --> 01:11:53,831
私底下说，我有什么
能帮你渡过难关的吗？
Personally, you need
something to tide you over?

795
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,255
愿你好运
Good luck to you.

796
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:08,095
汉密尔顿在底特律
有个34岁的姐姐，逮捕她
Hamilton has a 34-year-old
sister in Detroit. Arrest her.

797
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:12,474
把所有迪林杰认识的人
医生，家人都抓起来
Pick up all known Dillinger
associates, doctors, family,

798
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:14,602
皮尔蓬特的妈妈在印第安纳波利斯
Pierpont's mother
in Indianapolis,

799
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:16,604
迪林杰的家人住在穆尔斯维尔
Dillinger's family
in Mooresville.

800
01:12:16,688 --> 01:12:18,856
我们怀疑他们帮助窝藏逃犯
We suspect them
of harboring.

801
01:12:18,982 --> 01:12:22,026
但是汉密尔顿一家
已经很多年没有联系瑞德了
But Hamilton's family has not
had word from Red in years.

802
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,862
你去说服他们联系瑞德
You convince them
to get word.

803
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:27,448
制造消息，然后放出去
普韦斯探员
Create informants,
Agent Purvis.

804
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:30,367
对嫌犯进行长时间的
最严格的审讯
The suspects are to be
interrogated vigorously, grilled,

805
01:12:30,452 --> 01:12:32,828
我们决不同情姑息
no obsolete notions
of sentimentality.

806
01:12:32,912 --> 01:12:34,955
我们进入了新的时代
我们在创造历史
We are in the modern age.
We are making history.

807
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,291
采用最直接，最有效的手段
Take direct,
expedient action.

808
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,461
就像他们在意大利说的
“摘下白手套！”
As they say in Italy these days,
"Take off the white gloves!"

809
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:43,339
我们说得够明白了吧，普韦斯探员？
Do we understand each
other, Agent Purvis?

810
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,222
这都是些好小伙子
你叫什么名字，孩子？
These are fine young men
here. What's your name, son?

811
01:12:52,307 --> 01:12:53,390
哈里斯
Harris.

812
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,811
全国各地的探员们重拳出击
G- men all over the country
have picked up the gauntlet

813
01:12:57,896 --> 01:13:00,522
给不法分子和穷凶极恶的歹徒
以沉重打击
flung down by the outlaws
and the wanton murderers.

814
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:01,940
而这些年轻的斗士们
And these junior
crime fighters here,

815
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:04,652
作为犯罪克星中的新人
these Junior G-men, has,
every one of them,

816
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:06,570
每一个人都曾经阻止过罪案的发生
stopped some crime
from occurring

817
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:09,698
抢先一步将罪案扼杀在萌芽之中
and forestalled an entry into
the black book of criminal deeds.

818
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:12,534
今天，我将向他们颁发奖章
Today, I am rewarding them
with these medals.

819
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:15,329
我的朋友哈里斯将是第一个
获得奖章的，干的好，孩子
My friend Harris here is
the first. Well done, son.

820
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:17,831
汤米，你做事赚钱的本事没人可以比
You can size up a score like
nobody's business, Tommy.

821
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,208
你是个好样的
You're a good egg.

822
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:22,670
但是我不喜欢娃娃脸尼尔森
But I don't like
Baby Face Nelson.

823
01:13:22,754 --> 01:13:26,423
你误会尼尔森了，约翰
他站在你那一边
You got Nelson all wrong, John.
He thinks the world of you.

824
01:13:27,634 --> 01:13:30,219
该死的，整个国家都觉得你是个英雄
Hell, the whole country
thinks you're a goddamn hero.

825
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:33,013
那银行在哪里？
Where's the bank?

826
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:34,515
苏福尔斯
Sioux Falls.

827
01:13:34,599 --> 01:13:37,351
尼尔森说那里大概有80万
Nelson says there's
$800,000 in there.

828
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:39,770
他还说，他给我们找了个
不错的藏身地点
Says he's got us a sweet
little place to hole up

829
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:42,189
可以躲到风头过去
till after the heat
blows over.

830
01:13:42,273 --> 01:13:43,649
那他来这里干什么？
What's he here for?

831
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:49,863
约翰，我们要友好相处，好吗？
不然成不了事
John, we gotta all be friends, all
right, or this ain't gonna work.

832
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:54,201
瑞德告诉你了，抢完这次
我们就把皮尔蓬特和马克利踢掉
Red told you, after the bank,
we bust out Pierpont and Makley.

833
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:56,203
我们需要仔细合计一下
It'll take a lot
of careful planning.

834
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,038
是啊，然后？
Yeah. So?

835
01:13:58,123 --> 01:14:01,458
这就是头号公敌…约翰・迪林杰
...and Public Enemy
Number One, John Dillinger.

836
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:05,796
他可能就坐在你的身边
They may be sitting
amongst you.

837
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,843
也许就在你那排
They may be in your row.

838
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,687
看看你的右边
Turn to your right.

839
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,817
再看看你的左边
And turn to your left.

840
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,406
如果你看见他们
给调查局或者当地警局打电话
If you see them, call the Bureau of
Investigation or your local police.

841
01:14:45,754 --> 01:14:46,962
等抢完银行
After the bank,

842
01:14:47,046 --> 01:14:50,257
我们再商量要不要踢了他们，好吗？
we'll figure out if we
can bust them out. Okay?

843
01:14:55,472 --> 01:14:56,638
好吧
Okay.

844
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:11,862
“不和不认识的人干活”
"You don't work with
people you don't know

845
01:15:11,946 --> 01:15:13,238
“走投无路的时候不干活”
"and you don't work
when you're desperate. "

846
01:15:13,323 --> 01:15:15,407
沃特・迪崔克，还记得吗？
Walter Dietrich.
Remember that?

847
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,201
沃特忘记的是
Walter forgot.

848
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:20,788
当你绝望的时候
就是你别无选择的时候
When you're desperate,
that's when you got no choice.

849
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:38,305
我干掉了一个！
I got one!

850
01:15:47,482 --> 01:15:50,317
你干什么？举起手！举起手！
What are you doing? Get your
hands up! Get your hands up!

851
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:58,325
过来，宝贝儿，我们走，快走
Come on, sugar,
let's go. Come on.

852
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:02,037
我们要搞的钱在哪里？该死
Where's all the damn money
we came here for?

853
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:11,004
快点
Come on.

854
01:16:11,339 --> 01:16:12,965
- 开门
- 你在看什么？啊？
Open the door. What
are you looking at, huh?

855
01:16:14,592 --> 01:16:16,093
你在看什么？
What are you looking at?

856
01:16:39,784 --> 01:16:40,951
汤米
Tommy.

857
01:17:02,473 --> 01:17:03,932
约翰，我们走！
John, let's go!

858
01:17:09,522 --> 01:17:12,441
快走！该死的，进车里去！
Let's go!
Get in the goddamn car!

859
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,069
快走！快走！快走！
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

860
01:18:26,808 --> 01:18:28,141
你怎么找到这地方的？
How'd you find
this place?

861
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:30,769
别担心，没有人能找到我们，走吧
Don't worry. Nobody
will find us. Come on.

862
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:41,822
有多少钱？
How much?

863
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:44,825
46120块
$46, 120.

864
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:50,163
没到80万，是吗？
That'd be less than
$800,000. Am I right?

865
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,084
是不是？
Am I right?

866
01:18:54,752 --> 01:18:56,128
每个人8千
It's $8,000 a man.

867
01:19:01,259 --> 01:19:02,843
把我的份留下，都出去
Leave me
my share and get out.

868
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:26,616
我们得摆脱尼尔森
We gotta cut loose
from Nelson.

869
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:28,326
你得休息会儿
You gotta
rest up a while.

870
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,162
不
No.

871
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:34,332
不行，如果我们不明天一早就离开
No. If we don't get out of
here first thing in the morning,

872
01:19:35,126 --> 01:19:36,126
我们就挂定了
we're gonna wind up dead.

873
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,794
只有你才办得到
Only you're
gonna make it.

874
01:19:41,132 --> 01:19:43,592
去他妈的，别说这种丧气话，瑞德
God damn it, don't talk like that, Red.

875
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:46,636
不，约翰
我有种感觉，我的时代到头了
No, Johnny. I got a
feeling that my time is up.

876
01:19:47,555 --> 01:19:49,806
时代结束，就是真的结束了
And when your time is up,
your time's up.

877
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:55,312
瑞德
Red,

878
01:19:56,814 --> 01:19:57,814
看这儿
look here.

879
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:03,945
明天早上，霍莫尔
你和我一起去雷诺
Tomorrow morning, Homer,
you and me will go to Reno,

880
01:20:04,989 --> 01:20:06,364
一切都会好的
and everything
will be fine.

881
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:27,260
给我打止疼针
Give me a shot.

882
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:29,346
只要你告诉我他们藏在哪里
我就给你打针
I'll give you the shot if you
tell me where the gang's holed up.

883
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,972
- 我什么都不知道
- 娃娃脸尼尔森在哪里？
I don't know anything.
Where's Baby Face Nelson?

884
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:32,182
- 我不知道！
- 迪林杰在哪里？
I don't know!
Where's Dillinger?

885
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:33,308
- 我要知道他们在哪儿？
- 我不知道！
I wanna know where
they are. I don't know!

886
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:34,726
告诉我！他们在哪儿？
Tell me!
Where are they?

887
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,062
子弹穿过了他的后脑
The bullet entered
the back of his head.

888
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:38,605
留在了他的右眼里
It's resting
over his right eye.

889
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:39,731
不要打岔
Do not interfere.

890
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:41,691
不要打岔
他的脑子里有水肿，他马上就要死了！
Do not interfere. His brain is
swelling! He will be dead soon!

891
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:43,693
他很痛苦，我得给他打镇静剂
He's suffering and I
need to sedate him!

892
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:44,903
还不是时候
Not yet.

893
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:46,822
如果你敢插手，我就逮捕你
If you interfere,
I will arrest you.

894
01:20:46,906 --> 01:20:50,909
我不知道，求求你，给我打止疼针
妈妈啊，求你了
I don't know! Please, give
me a shot! Oh, mother, please!

895
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:52,786
- 告诉我他在哪儿！
- 我不知道！
Tell me where he is!
I don't know!

896
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:53,954
好吧
All right.

897
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:56,832
在哪儿？
Where?

898
01:21:00,336 --> 01:21:01,336
告诉我！
Tell me!

899
01:21:03,005 --> 01:21:04,756
小波西米亚，小波西米亚
Little Bohemia.
Little Bohemia.

900
01:21:04,841 --> 01:21:06,424
威斯康辛镇的曼尼塔沃什
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

901
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:08,385
操你妈！
Fuck you!

902
01:21:12,098 --> 01:21:13,473
给我打止疼针
Give me a shot.

903
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,615
小波西米亚在威斯康辛镇的
曼尼塔沃什
Little Bohemia is in
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

904
01:21:30,992 --> 01:21:32,492
萨姆，你来开
Sam, you drive up.

905
01:22:56,118 --> 01:23:00,914
马达拉和克雷格，你们从南边包抄
Madala and Clegg, you cut through
the woods. Stay in the trees.

906
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:02,332
躲在树林里
Come up on it
from the south,

907
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:05,418
看清楚他们在不在酒吧里
close enough to see if
they're in the barroom there.

908
01:23:05,503 --> 01:23:07,504
莱斯，罗尔
Rice, Rorer,

909
01:23:10,007 --> 01:23:12,842
你们从北边过去，那里是厨房
come up on it from the
north. The kitchen is there.

910
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:16,721
你看看他们是不是在客厅里
你们也要躲在树林里
You see if they're in what is probably
the dining room. You stay in the trees.

911
01:23:16,847 --> 01:23:18,765
如果他发现了我们
我们就冲进去
And if he sees them in there? We go in.

912
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:20,183
如果他没发现呢？
And if he doesn't?

913
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:24,187
我们照样冲进去
We go in anyway.

914
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:27,899
这里的房子太多了
There's too much
real estate out here.

915
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:29,234
他要很多条路可以逃出去
Too many ways for him
to get out,

916
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,611
我们人太少了，没法围捕他
too few of us
to block him in.

917
01:23:31,696 --> 01:23:33,571
我们必须把身后的路封住
We need to blockade
the roads behind us.

918
01:23:33,656 --> 01:23:36,408
我们必须等考利的人包围他
We need to wait for Cowley's
group to surround him.

919
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:38,702
普韦斯先生，你这么安排不行
Mr. Purvis, this is
not the way to do it.

920
01:23:41,872 --> 01:23:44,207
我不能让他们从手底下逃走
我担不起那个风险
I will not risk their
escaping the Bureau again.

921
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:48,795
你和赫特去东北方向的转角
You and Hurt take the northeast
corner where the road turns.

922
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:53,091
坎贝尔，你负责掩护前边
包姆跟我一起走
Cover that and the front.
Campbell, Baum, you're with me.

923
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:00,807
谢谢，但是我们得走了
Thanks,
but we gotta go.

924
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:02,475
别走了，留下来吧
我们继续开派对
No, come on, stick
around. Let's have a party.

925
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,602
- 我们明天还要干活
- 傻瓜才干活呢
We gotta work tomorrow.
Aw, work's for mugs.

926
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:05,895
出去吧！
Get out of here!

927
01:24:18,242 --> 01:24:19,659
你们想看我演詹姆斯・卡格尼吗？
[备注：30年代的电影演员]
You wanna see
my James Cagney?

928
01:24:19,744 --> 01:24:22,162
你们想看我演詹姆斯・卡格尼吗？
啊？啊？
You wanna see my James
Cagney act? Huh? Huh?

929
01:24:22,246 --> 01:24:24,664
你看见什么了？你想说什么？
你知道什么？
What do you see? What do
you say? What do you know?

930
01:24:24,749 --> 01:24:27,917
美女你叫什么名字？
这是你老婆么？傻蛋
What's your name, doll?
This your wife, you dumb egg?

931
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:41,264
走吧
Go ahead.

932
01:24:58,783 --> 01:24:59,991
停车！
Stop that car!

933
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:02,577
调查局！
Bureau of Investigation!

934
01:25:04,622 --> 01:25:05,705
停车
Stop that car!

935
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:09,626
开火！
Fire!

936
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:06,307
- 别开枪
- 趴到地上！
Don't shoot!
Get on the floor!

937
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:18,027
强尼！
Johnny!

938
01:27:07,828 --> 01:27:08,995
走啊！
Go!

939
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:50,286
有人跑了！
Someone got out!

940
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:53,456
是不是迪林杰？
Is it Dillinger?

941
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:55,041
我想是的！
I think so!

942
01:27:56,502 --> 01:27:59,462
包姆，往旁边开，顺着林子追
Baum, you drive around
the woods. You flank him!

943
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:32,680
走
Go.

944
01:29:34,516 --> 01:29:35,683
走！
Go!

945
01:29:49,114 --> 01:29:51,866
加油，瑞德，坚持住
我们就要出去了
Come on, Red, come on. Come
on. We're getting out of here.

946
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:05,463
嘿，把车钥匙给我
Hey, give me the keys
to that car.

947
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:32,573
你有没有...
Have you...

948
01:30:36,787 --> 01:30:38,413
你们这些混蛋都穿着防弹背心
All you bastards
wear vests,

949
01:30:38,497 --> 01:30:41,582
我应该打上面呢，还是打下面呢
so I'm gonna give it to you high
and I'm gonna give it to you low.

950
01:30:57,599 --> 01:30:58,808
卡特？
Carter?

951
01:31:04,189 --> 01:31:06,232
是谁干的？ 迪林杰？
Who was it? Dillinger?

952
01:31:06,316 --> 01:31:07,984
尼尔森
Nelson.

953
01:31:29,506 --> 01:31:31,841
长官，有人拦在路中间
Sir, there's somebody
on the road.

954
01:31:33,677 --> 01:31:35,261
考利，你看到车开过没有？
PURVIS: Cowley!
Did you see a car?

955
01:31:35,345 --> 01:31:36,763
有辆福特，朝另外一个方向开去
A Ford, yeah,
it's going the other way.

956
01:31:36,847 --> 01:31:39,724
掉头，马达拉进来
车里是尼尔森
Turn it around! Madala,
get in. It's Nelson!

957
01:31:55,532 --> 01:31:57,909
进来，你这个白痴，进来！
Get in, you dumb bastards!
Get in!

958
01:31:59,912 --> 01:32:02,163
进来，快点，我们走，快
Get in. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

959
01:32:02,706 --> 01:32:03,956
你从哪里搞来这车的？
Where'd
you get the car?

960
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:05,249
我在路边干掉了一个条子
I killed a Fed
by the road.

961
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:11,214
开快点，萨姆！
Faster, Sam!

962
01:32:23,101 --> 01:32:25,102
他们就在后面，霍莫尔！
给他们点颜色瞧瞧
They're behind us.
Let them have it, Homer!

963
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:32,151
稳住，该死的！
Steady the car,
God damn it!

964
01:32:42,412 --> 01:32:43,538
他妈的！
Shit!

965
01:33:01,265 --> 01:33:03,099
霍莫尔！霍莫尔！
Homer! Homer!

966
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,949
来啊！
Come on!

967
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:03,409
你见过人死吗？
Have you never seen
a man die before?

968
01:34:03,493 --> 01:34:04,660
闭嘴
Hush up.

969
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:08,831
约翰，让他去吧
You gotta let go, John.

970
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,208
狗屎！
Bullshit.

971
01:34:15,339 --> 01:34:17,256
你也离开比莉吧
And you gotta
let Billie go, too.

972
01:34:23,013 --> 01:34:24,388
我了解你
I know you.

973
01:34:26,183 --> 01:34:27,892
你绝对不会让任何人失望
You've never let
nobody down.

974
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:30,811
但是这一次
But this time,

975
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:33,314
你要想开点
you gotta go on.

976
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:36,984
你必须学会放手
You gotta let go.

977
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:12,895
到现在为止
Right now,

978
01:35:14,564 --> 01:35:16,482
迪林杰的所有朋友都死了
all of Dillinger's
friends are dead.

979
01:35:19,569 --> 01:35:20,820
他人就在那里
He is out there.

980
01:35:22,698 --> 01:35:24,073
只剩下他一个人
He is alone.

981
01:35:26,118 --> 01:35:30,037
要追捕他，没有比现在更好的机会了
And there will not be a
better chance to run him down.

982
01:35:31,164 --> 01:35:32,832
是啊，但是他可能出现在
任何一个地方
Yeah, but he could
be anywhere.

983
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:34,667
也许是这样
He could be anywhere.

984
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:37,753
但他哪里也不会去
因为他要的东西在这里
But he is not anywhere, because
what he wants is right here.

985
01:36:01,111 --> 01:36:03,195
我不信任政府
I don't believe
in the government,

986
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,531
我也不相信政府会投入所有的钱
and I don't believe in the
government spending all its money,

987
01:36:05,615 --> 01:36:08,451
所以我不愿意参与进去
and hence I don't
take any part of it.

988
01:36:09,244 --> 01:36:11,912
你如果拒绝，你…
And you say no, you...

989
01:36:28,722 --> 01:36:31,557
我应该拒绝接受这些钱
这是政府的钱
I ought to refuse to accept the
money. It's government money.

990
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:34,185
我不相信政府的拨款
I don't believe in
the government spending.

991
01:36:34,394 --> 01:36:36,645
我不会拿的
I'm not gonna take it.

992
01:36:40,108 --> 01:36:41,484
她在做什么？
What's she doing?

993
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:43,986
还在听广播
Still listening
to the radio.

994
01:37:41,002 --> 01:37:43,796
长官，我们询问了一个线人
约翰・普罗巴斯克
Sir, we have questioned
a source, John Probasco.

995
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,049
我们相信，他们可能…
We have information that leads
us to believe that they're...

996
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:16,704
不过从某个方面来说
迪林杰确实推动了法制建设
But Dillinger did aid
law enforcement in one way.

997
01:38:17,664 --> 01:38:21,584
他被认为是议院考虑实施
第一个全国性法案
He's cited as the reason Congress is
considering the first national crime bill,

998
01:38:21,668 --> 01:38:25,254
将犯罪集团跨州犯罪认定为
触犯联邦法令的主要原因
making criminal enterprise across
state lines a federal offense.

999
01:38:25,338 --> 01:38:26,505
与此同时，在北达科他的法戈…
Meanwhile, in Fargo,
North Dakota...

1000
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:28,299
我们的业务已经遍布全国了…
We're building
coast-to-coast.

1001
01:38:28,383 --> 01:38:30,885
我们只想要不动声响地赚我们的钱
他们却搞了这么一出
We want it nice and quiet,
and they bring this on us?

1002
01:38:31,428 --> 01:38:34,430
弗兰克，冷静点
他们只是抢劫银行
Frank, calm down. They rob banks. Right.

1003
01:38:34,764 --> 01:38:38,350
先是一个州，再是另一个，这叫跨州
In one state, then another
state, that's called interstate.

1004
01:38:38,435 --> 01:38:40,811
我们这也是跨州，你清醒点
We're coast to coast.
Wake up!

1005
01:38:40,896 --> 01:38:42,563
现在他们可以用这些法律
来对付我们了
Now they can use
these laws on us.

1006
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,667
现在什么时间了？
BILLIE: What time is it?

1007
01:39:05,212 --> 01:39:08,130
星期天早上4点，怎么了？
It's 4:00 a. m., Sunday
morning. What's wrong?

1008
01:39:09,466 --> 01:39:10,925
我不想睡了
I don't want to sleep.

1009
01:39:11,009 --> 01:39:12,134
为什么？
Why?

1010
01:39:13,678 --> 01:39:15,679
因为我要珍惜两个人
在一起的每一刻
Because I want
all the time we got.

1011
01:39:27,651 --> 01:39:28,984
如果…
What if

1012
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:32,529
我们能够一起离开这里？
we could get out
of here altogether?

1013
01:39:35,825 --> 01:39:36,992
去哪里？
Where?

1014
01:39:39,246 --> 01:39:40,412
比如古巴？
Like Cuba?

1015
01:39:41,331 --> 01:39:42,373
也许更远的地方
Maybe further.

1016
01:39:44,626 --> 01:39:48,379
阿尔文有笔生意，是笔大生意
能赚不少
Alvin's got this job. It's
a big job, a lot of dough.

1017
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:52,675
有了钱我们就可以走了
We could go away on it.

1018
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:55,970
我们找架潘・安姆小型飞机
飞去加拉加斯
We grab a Pan Am
Clipper to Caracas,

1019
01:39:56,846 --> 01:39:59,640
然后跑到里约热内卢去晒太阳
吃喝玩乐
scoot on over to Rio
for some fun in the sun,

1020
01:40:02,227 --> 01:40:03,519
从地图上消失
slide off the map.

1021
01:40:07,357 --> 01:40:08,732
我们可以随时随地
We could go dancing

1022
01:40:09,734 --> 01:40:11,318
一起跳舞
and have
a lot of laughs

1023
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:14,154
调笑
any time we want.

1024
01:40:20,078 --> 01:40:21,870
愿意和我一起去吗？
Want to take
that ride with me?

1025
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,503
好的，我愿意跟你一起去
Yeah, I want to take
that ride with you.

1026
01:40:54,988 --> 01:40:56,363
哪里的公寓？
BILLIE: Where's
the apartment?

1027
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,698
在奥克利和伯托姆街
Oakley and Potomac.

1028
01:40:57,782 --> 01:41:00,284
负责吧台的人叫拉利・斯特朗
All right, the bartender's
name is Larry Strong.

1029
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,161
他会把钥匙给你
He'll give you the keys.

1030
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:36,820
谁带你来的？你怎么过来的？
Who brought you?
How did you get here?

1031
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:41,116
出租车啊，我打出租来的
A taxi. I took a taxi.

1032
01:42:04,974 --> 01:42:07,184
我们走，快点
弟兄们，把她带出去
Let's go. Let's go, guys.
Come on! Get her outside.

1033
01:43:26,723 --> 01:43:27,890
他在哪里？
Where is he?

1034
01:43:28,892 --> 01:43:30,893
你们在哪里碰面？
你们躲在哪里了？
Where were you meeting?
Where were you hiding out?

1035
01:43:30,977 --> 01:43:34,229
回答他，不然他们会把你丢进
库克郡黑乎乎的监狱里去
REINECKE: Answer him or they'll drop
you in a black hole in Cook County.

1036
01:43:41,112 --> 01:43:42,404
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

1037
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:45,532
我要去厕所
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1038
01:44:21,945 --> 01:44:23,737
上帝啊，看看你都干了什么
Christ, look what you did.

1039
01:44:26,783 --> 01:44:28,742
你本来要跟他在哪里见面的？
Where were you
supposed to meet him?

1040
01:44:32,914 --> 01:44:34,206
我听不见
I can't hear you.

1041
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:37,042
我听不见！
I can't hear you!

1042
01:44:48,513 --> 01:44:50,973
我们本来要在我们的公寓里见面的
We were supposed to
meet at our apartment.

1043
01:44:52,267 --> 01:44:53,433
在哪儿？
Where?

1044
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:55,686
爱迪生大街
On Addison.

1045
01:44:56,145 --> 01:44:57,396

What number?

1046
01:44:59,774 --> 01:45:01,608
1148号
1148.

1047
01:45:01,693 --> 01:45:03,151
什么时候见面？
When?

1048
01:45:06,489 --> 01:45:07,739
就现在
Right now.

1049
01:45:14,998 --> 01:45:17,499
罗伯茨小姐，你能联系上
普韦斯探员吗？
Miss Roberts, can you
reach Agent Purvis?

1050
01:45:17,584 --> 01:45:20,252
不行，他正从印第安纳的
穆尔斯维尔赶回来
No. He's on his way back
from Mooresville, Indiana.

1051
01:45:20,336 --> 01:45:22,212
他会直接去库克郡监狱
He's going directly
to Cook County Jail.

1052
01:45:25,466 --> 01:45:28,427
约翰・迪林杰躲在爱迪生大街1148号
John Dillinger's holed up
at 1148 Addison.

1053
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,547
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

1054
01:46:09,344 --> 01:46:10,385
好吧
Well,

1055
01:46:13,306 --> 01:46:16,391
他现在已经跑远了吧？
way the hell away from
here by now, isn't he?

1056
01:46:18,144 --> 01:46:21,730
你想要知道他在哪里？
你这个白痴警察
You wanted to know where
he is, you dumb flatfoot.

1057
01:46:24,442 --> 01:46:27,903
普韦斯先生，他们不能
这样对待一位女士
Mr. Purvis, those men cannot
treat a woman in this way.

1058
01:46:30,865 --> 01:46:33,575
在司推特街的时候
你就从他身边走过
You walked right past him
on State Street.

1059
01:46:34,619 --> 01:46:36,912
你紧张的要死，根本顾不上看周围
You were too scared
to look around.

1060
01:46:37,622 --> 01:46:39,956
他就坐在那辆黑色别克的驾驶座里
He was at the curb
in that black Buick.

1061
01:46:41,167 --> 01:46:43,835
你问我怎么来的？
我告诉你说我打车来的
You asked me how I got there,
I told you I took a taxi,

1062
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,088
你居然相信了
and you believed me?

1063
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:50,008
他把我放下，然后在那儿等我
He dropped me off
and was waiting for me.

1064
01:46:50,593 --> 01:46:53,512
你就直接从他身边走过
And you walked
right past him.

1065
01:47:02,397 --> 01:47:07,109
如果我的强尼知道你打了他的女人
And when my Johnny finds out
how you slapped around his girl,

1066
01:47:08,444 --> 01:47:11,697
死胖子，你知道会发生什么事吗？
you know what happens
to you, fat boy?

1067
01:47:20,248 --> 01:47:21,456
放开她
Uncuff her.

1068
01:47:35,471 --> 01:47:37,472
厕所在下面的大厅
Restroom is
down the hall.

1069
01:47:44,647 --> 01:47:46,064
我站不起来
I can't stand up.

1070
01:48:05,918 --> 01:48:07,085
罗杰斯小姐
Miss Rogers.

1071
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,936
你好
Hello.

1072
01:48:25,521 --> 01:48:29,024
我是马蒂・扎克维奇
有人让我打电话给你，尼蒂先生
I'm Marty Zarkovich. I was
told to call you, Mr. Nitti.

1073
01:48:30,067 --> 01:48:32,027
我想我可以安排她去跟警方合作
I think I can get her
to play ball.

1074
01:48:33,529 --> 01:48:34,696
一定要搞定
Make sure.

1075
01:48:37,742 --> 01:48:38,950
是的，尼蒂先生
Yes, sir, Mr. Nitti.

1076
01:48:48,586 --> 01:48:50,045
他们怎么说，安娜？
What did they say, Anna?

1077
01:48:53,049 --> 01:48:55,675
他们说要把我送回罗马尼亚
They say they send me
back to Romania.

1078
01:48:57,094 --> 01:48:58,386
你知道该怎么做吗？
You know what to do.

1079
01:49:05,394 --> 01:49:08,063
他们能收回驱逐出境的法令么？
他们可以么？
Can they fix deportation?
Can they do that?

1080
01:49:09,565 --> 01:49:11,316
这群家伙无所不能
These guys
can fix anything.

1081
01:49:21,369 --> 01:49:22,452
很好
Okay.

1082
01:49:48,604 --> 01:49:49,855
我要你保证
I want guarantee.

1083
01:49:52,275 --> 01:49:55,360
如果你帮我们逮捕约翰・迪林杰
If you aid us in
apprehending John Dillinger,

1084
01:49:55,987 --> 01:49:57,529
我向你保证
I give you my word

1085
01:49:58,155 --> 01:50:00,824
我会通过一切方法
I will do everything I can to
influence Bureau of Immigration

1086
01:50:00,908 --> 01:50:02,367
要求调查局帮你留在美国
to let you stay
in America.

1087
01:50:02,451 --> 01:50:03,577
这条件不够
Not enough.

1088
01:50:04,954 --> 01:50:06,413
最多就这样了
Well, that's all there is.

1089
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:08,748
我要你保证
I want guarantee.

1090
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:11,960
你得不到任何保证
Well, you're not
gonna get one.

1091
01:50:13,629 --> 01:50:15,130
我觉得这一切都是你干的
I think you did this.

1092
01:50:15,214 --> 01:50:18,633
是你让移民局把我抓起来
把我遣返回罗马尼亚
I think you told Immigration to pick
me up and send me back to Romania.

1093
01:50:21,012 --> 01:50:22,804
你怎么和他联系？
How do you
socialize with him?

1094
01:50:26,726 --> 01:50:27,893
我们一起出去
We go out.

1095
01:50:30,354 --> 01:50:33,106
也许明天晚上，也许不是
Maybe tomorrow night.
Maybe not.

1096
01:50:34,275 --> 01:50:37,485
可能是这一周，这个月
也可能永远都不出去
Maybe in a week, a month.
Maybe never.

1097
01:50:40,573 --> 01:50:43,325
我无法保证移民局会做什么
I will not guarantee
what Immigration will do,

1098
01:50:43,409 --> 01:50:45,577
但我可以确定我能做些什么
but I can guarantee
what I will do.

1099
01:50:45,661 --> 01:50:48,038
你如果不合作的话
If you do not cooperate,

1100
01:50:49,373 --> 01:50:52,709
48小时之内你就会在
离开这个国家的船上
you will be on a boat out
of this country in 48 hours.

1101
01:50:53,336 --> 01:50:55,170
不要和我玩游戏了
Do not play games
with me.

1102
01:51:02,511 --> 01:51:03,678
我们是指谁？
Who is "we"?

1103
01:51:05,014 --> 01:51:08,308
我，他，还有我手下的一个女孩
波莉・汉米尔顿
Me, him, Polly Hamilton,
one of my girls.

1104
01:51:10,645 --> 01:51:12,270
我们怎么知道呢？
How will we know?

1105
01:51:13,856 --> 01:51:15,857
等我知道的那天通知你
I call you on the day
when I know.

1106
01:51:41,634 --> 01:51:42,634
你进去了？你见到她了？
Did you get in there?
Did you see her?

1107
01:51:42,718 --> 01:51:44,094
是的
Yes, I did.

1108
01:51:45,388 --> 01:51:46,846
她塞了张纸条给我
She palmed me
this note.

1109
01:52:02,863 --> 01:52:04,406
她告诉我上面写了什么
PIQUETT: She told me
what it said.

1110
01:52:05,491 --> 01:52:06,741
这主意不错
That's good advice.

1111
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:11,913
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

1112
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:16,334
和人见面
Meeting people.

1113
01:52:31,934 --> 01:52:35,020
星期二，这辆列车会负责运送
洛克弗德附近7家工厂的工资
On Tuesday, it'll carry the payrolls
for seven factories around Rockford.

1114
01:52:35,104 --> 01:52:36,938
入口和出口各有两条
There's two ways in,
two ways out.

1115
01:52:37,023 --> 01:52:39,816
医生会提前5分钟切断电话线
Doc cuts the telephone lines
five minutes before.

1116
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:42,193
列车到站之后你和我冲进去

1117
01:52:42,278 --> 01:52:44,029

吉米和佛莱蒂开车
Jimmy and Freddy drive.

1119
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:49,701
你算算大概有多少？
What do you figure?

1120
01:52:49,785 --> 01:52:53,246
150万到170万
About $1,500,000
to $1,700,000.

1121
01:52:53,914 --> 01:52:55,874
每个人30万
$300,000 each.

1122
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,459
- 老天爷啊
- 嗯
Holy cow.
Yeah.

1123
01:52:59,462 --> 01:53:01,963
我们星期二动手，星期三我就闪人
We pull this Tuesday,
I'm gone Wednesday.

1124
01:53:02,048 --> 01:53:03,548
去哪儿？ 古巴？
Yeah. Where? Cuba?

1125
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,175
不
No.

1126
01:53:06,093 --> 01:53:08,970
我要走的话得找个比古巴更远的地方
No. Where I go, I'm gonna have
to go a lot farther than Cuba.

1127
01:53:10,514 --> 01:53:11,765
哦
Yeah.

1128
01:53:22,068 --> 01:53:23,068
嗨，吉米
Hi, Jimmy.

波莉，吉米回来了！

跟你说啊
I tell you what, doll.

1132
01:53:45,132 --> 01:53:47,967
你，我和波莉今晚去看电影怎么样？
How about you, Polly and me
go out to a movie tonight?

1133
01:53:48,052 --> 01:53:49,552
休息一下，消消暑
Get in some refrigeration.

1134
01:53:50,221 --> 01:53:51,679
你想去哪里看？
Where do you

1135
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:54,349
玛宝，或者拜奥影像吧

Mmm.

1138
01:53:59,271 --> 01:54:01,648
我等会去下店里，晚上做炸鸡
I'll go to the store later and
make fried chicken for dinner.

1139
01:54:01,732 --> 01:54:03,024
你去哪儿？
Where you going?

1140
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:04,400
坐有轨电车回去
Streetcar.

1141
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:07,362
我要到城里去拿我的侍者证
I gotta go downtown to get
my waitressing license.

1142
01:54:08,572 --> 01:54:12,325
你等一等，我带你去，这里太热了
Hang on a minute. I'll take
you. It's too damn hot in here.

1143
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:13,910
真的？
Yeah?

1144
01:54:30,177 --> 01:54:32,595
普韦斯先生，是安娜・塞吉
Mr. Purvis. Anna Sage.

1145
01:54:35,099 --> 01:54:36,599
下午好，塞吉小姐
Afternoon, Miss Sage.

1146
01:54:44,692 --> 01:54:45,859
今天晚上！
It is tonight!

1147
01:54:46,402 --> 01:54:48,194
安娜・塞吉会跟他在一起

1148
01:54:48,279 --> 01:54:51,447
她穿白色的衬衫，桔黄色的短裙
and will wear a white blouse
over an orange skirt.

1149
01:54:51,532 --> 01:54:53,449
他可能化了装
PURVIS: That is how
we will know it is him.

1150
01:54:54,326 --> 01:54:56,286
有了安娜，我们就知道是他了
He may have changed
his appearance.

1151
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:59,164
我们还不知道他会去玛宝
还是拜奥影像
And we have not learned if he will
go to the Marbro or the Biograph.

1152
01:54:59,248 --> 01:55:01,249
- 有两家电影院？
- 没错
Two theaters?
That's right.

1153
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:02,584
放得什么片子
What's playing?

1154
01:55:02,668 --> 01:55:03,877
你问什么？
Excuse me?

1155
01:55:03,961 --> 01:55:06,671
玛宝放什么片子？
拜奥影像放什么片子？
What's playing at the Marbro?
What's playing at the Biograph?

1156
01:55:10,092 --> 01:55:13,887
玛宝放的是秀兰・邓波儿的
小小姐马克
A Shirley Temple movie called
Little Miss Marker is at the Marbro.

1157
01:55:13,971 --> 01:55:16,222
拜奥影像的是黑帮片
The Biograph is playing

1159
01:55:19,768 --> 01:55:22,604
约翰・迪林杰不会去看秀兰・邓波儿
John Dillinger ain't going
to a Shirley Temple movie.

1160
01:55:23,147 --> 01:55:26,566
芝加哥警察局的扎克维奇
和奥尼尔警官
Sergeants Zarkovich and O'Neill, from
the East Chicago Police Department,

1161
01:55:26,650 --> 01:55:30,486
还有文斯特探员会去守着拜奥影像
我也一起去
and Agent Winstead will be
at the Biograph, as will I.

1162
01:55:30,571 --> 01:55:33,489
维吉尔・皮特森，你去玛宝那边协调
Now, Virgil Peterson, you
will coordinate the Marbro.

1163
01:55:33,574 --> 01:55:36,618
他有枪，而且很危险
He will be armed and
extremely dangerous.

1164
01:55:40,956 --> 01:55:42,207
就这里？
Is that it?

1165
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:43,416
嗯
Yep.

1166
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,251
- 我很快就回来
- 等等
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

1167
01:55:50,466 --> 01:55:51,716
我跟你一起进去
I'll go in with you.

1168
01:55:52,635 --> 01:55:53,927
好吧
All right.

1169
01:55:57,598 --> 01:55:59,140
我大概要10分钟
It might take 10 minutes.

1170
01:56:00,142 --> 01:56:01,476
我们外面碰头
I'll meet you outside.

1171
01:58:00,429 --> 01:58:03,848
我希望能看到贝比
这个赛季再挥一次棒
I'd like to see Babe take
one more swing this season.

1172
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:10,772
但是他的腿伤挺严重的，他已经开始
进行挥棒练习了，不过量不大
But his leg is pretty sore. He takes a
bit of batting practice, but not very much.

1173
01:58:15,569 --> 01:58:16,778
比分多少了？
What's the score?

1174
01:58:17,946 --> 01:58:19,822
小熊队领先，3-2，7局上半
Cubs, 3-2,
top of the 7th.

1175
01:58:20,282 --> 01:58:22,325
怪不得他今天没有上场
...that's why he's
out of today's game.

1176
01:58:22,409 --> 01:58:24,869
这球很高，一个好球
The pitch is high.
Ball one.

1177
01:58:25,371 --> 01:58:29,624
扬基队的首席击球员布洛加
Broaca, the batter
leading off for the Yankees,

1178
01:58:30,459 --> 01:58:32,168
没有看清球路
did not see
the ball very well.

1179
01:58:34,338 --> 01:58:35,630
情况怎么样了？
What's going on?

1180
01:58:39,134 --> 01:58:40,426
没有情况
Nothing yet.

1181
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:50,019
他们没有在玛宝出现
They haven't shown up
at the Marbro.

1182
02:00:24,865 --> 02:00:26,157
布莱基！
吉姆！
Blackie!
Jim!

1183
02:00:26,241 --> 02:00:27,408
你这个老东西！
Well, you old
son of a gun!

1184
02:00:27,493 --> 02:00:29,327
我是说，你看起来起色很不错，吉姆
I say, you're
looking swell, Jim.

1185
02:00:29,411 --> 02:00:30,995
德普西对上菲尔波
我们一起去看场好戏？
Let's get a load of this
Dempsey-Firpo binge, shall we?

1186
02:00:31,079 --> 02:00:33,539
好啊，好啊，但是我们什么时候才能
再碰头呢？上帝啊，有好几个礼拜了！
Yeah, yeah. But when will we get
together again? Gee, it's been weeks!

1187
02:00:33,624 --> 02:00:35,166
那么，明天晚上怎么样？星期六呢？
Well, what about
tomorrow night? Saturday?

1188
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:38,794
他出来的时候我会点雪茄
I will light my cigar
when he's coming out.

1189
02:00:39,463 --> 02:00:42,798
扎克维奇，奥尼尔
Zarkovich, O'Neill,
you and your men

1190
02:00:42,883 --> 02:00:45,426
你带你们的人去街对面右边的帽子店
take the hat store right
across from the theater.

1191
02:00:46,094 --> 02:00:50,431
史密斯，苏兰，克雷格
你们带两个人到后面的巷子守着
Smith, Suran, Clegg, take two
agents, you cover the rear alley.

1192
02:00:51,099 --> 02:00:55,061
罗尔和莱斯，你们待在车里
雷因克在北边
And Rorer and Rice, you stay in
the car with Reinecke to the north.

1193
02:00:55,145 --> 02:00:57,021
卡莱伦斯和我会在电影院门口的南边
Clarence and I are
gonna be in the doorway

1194
02:00:57,105 --> 02:00:59,524
大概30英尺的地方
30 feet south of
the theater entrance.

1195
02:00:59,608 --> 02:01:03,194
盖里，你去北边的入口
到车里去守着
Gerry, you're in the tan sedan
just to the north of the entrance.

1196
02:01:03,278 --> 02:01:04,737
以防他去北面？
In case he walks north?

1197
02:01:04,821 --> 02:01:06,781
他不会朝北走的，普韦斯先生
He ain't gonna walk
north, Mr. Purvis.

1198
02:01:06,865 --> 02:01:10,326
他会往南走，抄小巷子回去她家
He's gonna head south, cut through
the alley back to her place.

1199
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:13,871
马达拉
Madala.

1200
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:24,757
你好，格兰杰
Hello, Gallagher.

1201
02:01:24,841 --> 02:01:26,217
你好，斯诺
Hello, Snow.

1202
02:01:26,301 --> 02:01:27,426
比赛中途把我叫到这里来
Must be something
pretty important,

1203
02:01:27,511 --> 02:01:29,345
一定是有什么重要的事情吧
getting me in here in
the middle of the game.

1204
02:01:29,429 --> 02:01:30,555
你想要做什么？
What do you want?

1205
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:32,807
我想为朋友帮点小忙
I want to do a little
favor for a friend.

1206
02:01:52,661 --> 02:01:56,122
你是政府官员，你可以救他的
You're the governor.
You can save his life.

1207
02:01:58,041 --> 02:02:00,585
陪审团说了，他有罪
He's guilty.
The jury says so.

1208
02:02:21,857 --> 02:02:23,190
再见，布莱基
Goodbye, Blackie.

1209
02:02:50,385 --> 02:02:51,469
再见，吉姆
Goodbye, Jim.

1210
02:02:51,553 --> 02:02:52,970
我无能为力，布莱基
I can't help it, Blackie.

1211
02:02:53,055 --> 02:02:54,680
我不会让你死的
I'm not gonna
let you die.

1212
02:02:55,307 --> 02:02:56,557
我会帮你争取减刑的
I've got to commute you.

1213
02:02:57,142 --> 02:02:58,601
让我之后的日子里
都被困在这肮脏的陷阱里
You think you're
doing me a favor

1214
02:02:58,685 --> 02:03:01,395
你觉得这是帮我么
by keeping me locked up in this
filthy trap for the rest of my life?

1215
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:05,024
不用了，谢谢，典狱长，我们走吧
No, thanks. Come on,
warden, let's go.

1216
02:03:30,592 --> 02:03:31,967
再见，布莱基
So long, Blackie.

1217
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:35,429
孩子，没必要哭哭啼啼的
Kid, keep your chin
up and your nose clean.

1218
02:03:39,434 --> 02:03:41,852
怎么来就怎么去，一下子的事
这就是你要走的路
Die the way you lived, all of
a sudden, that's the way to go.

1219
02:03:41,937 --> 02:03:43,688
不要拖拖拉拉的
Don't drag it out.

1220
02:03:43,772 --> 02:03:45,898
那样活着一点意义都没有
Living like that
doesn't mean a thing.

1221
02:07:02,971 --> 02:07:04,305
他说了什么？
What did he say?

1222
02:07:07,017 --> 02:07:08,475
我听不清楚
I couldn't hear him.

1223
02:07:20,488 --> 02:07:23,657
你来处理，我去给华盛顿打电话
You take care of this. I
need to go call Washington.

1224
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:55,332
你好，比莉
How you doing, Billie?

1225
02:08:59,713 --> 02:09:01,547
我是文斯特特别探员
I'm Special Agent Winstead.

1226
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:08,429
如果你是过来继续问我
那些该死的问题…
If you've come here to ask
me more damn questions...

1227
02:09:09,222 --> 02:09:11,515
“这个人，那个人，在哪里？”
"Where's this one
or that one?"

1228
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:14,018
我不是过来盘问你的
I didn't come here for
you to tell me something.

1229
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:17,062
我是过来告诉你事情的
I came here to
tell you something.

1230
02:09:27,657 --> 02:09:29,700
他们说，你们开枪杀了他
They say you're the man who shot him.

1231
02:09:32,996 --> 02:09:35,497
没错，我们其中的一个
That's right.
One of them.

1232
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,959
那你为什么要过来看我？
So why are you
coming here to see me?

1233
02:09:41,087 --> 02:09:43,088
来看看你们的“功绩”？
To see the damage
you've done?

1234
02:09:46,176 --> 02:09:47,259
不是
No.

1235
02:09:50,138 --> 02:09:52,097
因为是他要我过来的
I came here because
he asked me to.

1236
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,896
他死的时候，说了些话
When he went down,
he said something.

1237
02:10:00,815 --> 02:10:02,649
我凑近他的嘴边
I put my ear
next to his mouth,

1238
02:10:03,818 --> 02:10:05,736
我想他说的大概是
and what I think
he said was this.

1239
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:08,989
他说
He said,

1240
02:10:09,783 --> 02:10:11,658
“帮我告诉比莉”
"Tell Billie for me,

1241
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:14,828
“再见，黑鸟”
"'Bye-bye, blackbird. "'

1242
02:11:12,715 --> 02:11:16,715
梅尔文・普韦斯一年后退出了
联邦调查局，1960年，他自杀身亡

1243
02:11:18,715 --> 02:11:22,715
比莉・弗莱切特在1936年被释放
并在威斯康辛州终老

1244
02:11:44,615 --> 02:11:59,615
