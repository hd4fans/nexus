1
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,921
<i>This is a story of an ordinary little boy...</i>

2
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,114
<i>... named Charlie Bucket.</i>

3
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:28,320
<i>He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.</i>

4
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:35,099
<i>His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.</i>

5
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,070
<i>In fact, they barely had enough to eat.</i>

6
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:44,545
<i>Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.</i>

7
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:47,079
<i>He just didn't know it yet.</i>

8
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,660
- Evening, Buckets.
- Evening.

9
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,301
Hi, Dad.

10
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,634
Soup's almost ready, darling.

11
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,471
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

12
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,939
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

13
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:24,952
Charlie...

14
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,854
...I found something I think you'll like.

15
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:35,359
<i>Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.</i>

16
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,557
<i>The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...</i>

17
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:44,569
<i>... yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.</i>

18
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,599
It's exactly what I need.

19
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,210
What is it, Charlie?

20
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:59,743
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

21
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:02,913
- What piece was it?
- A head for Willy Wonka.

22
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,353
Well, how wonderful.

23
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,551
It's quite a likeness.

24
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:08,389
- You think so?
- Think so?

25
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:10,155
I know so.

26
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,995
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

27
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,467
- I used to work for him, you know.
- You did?

28
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,162
- I did.
- He did.

29
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,634
He did.

30
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,776
I love grapes.

31
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:26,342
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

32
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,675
<i>Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.</i>

33
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:35,852
<i>But the whole world wanted his candy.</i>

34
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,558
- Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?

35
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,527
We need more Wonka bars...

36
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:47,532
...and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?

37
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,133
Birds.

38
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:53,365
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

39
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,705
Now open.

40
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,943
The man was a genius.

41
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:08,786
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

42
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:12,620
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

43
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:17,288
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

44
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,363
- But that's impossible.
- But Willy Wonka did it.

45
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:25,666
<i>Before long...</i>

46
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,442
<i>... he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.</i>

47
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:32,671
<i>The largest chocolate factory in history.</i>

48
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:36,146
<i>Fifty times as big as any other.</i>

49
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,831
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

50
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:01,739
Tell him about the Indian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

51
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,575
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

52
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:09,513
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

53
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,409
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

54
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:17,188
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

55
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:26,657
It will have 100 rooms, and everything will
be made of either dark or light chocolate.

56
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:33,140
<i>True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...</i>

57
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:36,038
<i>... and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.</i>

58
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,111
<i>All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.</i>

59
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,850
<i>So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.</i>

60
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,955
It is perfect in every way.

61
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:51,217
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

62
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:55,193
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

63
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:58,696
I intend to live in it.

64
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.</i>

65
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:09,771
<i>Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.</i>

66
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,679
<i>The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...</i>

67
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,752
<i>... but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.</i>

68
00:09:55,657 --> 00:10:00,560
<i>All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.</i>

69
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:05,496
<i>They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.</i>

70
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:37,355
<i>Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.</i>

71
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:41,935
<i>Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.</i>

72
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,867
<i>Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...</i>

73
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,065
<i>... that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.</i>

74
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:51,172
<i>The thievery got so bad...</i>

75
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,507
<i>... that one day, without warning...</i>

76
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:58,243
<i>... Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.</i>

77
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,221
<i>He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.</i>

78
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:07,623
I'm closing my chocolate factory forever.

79
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,058
I'm sorry.

80
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:28,807
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

81
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:33,215
Yes, well, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time."

82
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,118
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever."

83
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:40,951
- Now, Pops.
- The factory did close, Charlie.

84
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,088
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

85
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:49,930
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

86
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:54,006
- The factory was back in business.
- Did you get your job back?

87
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,276
No.

88
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,275
No one did.

89
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,580
But there must be people working there.

90
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:07,285
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

91
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:10,151
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

92
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:14,528
No. The gates are always closed.

93
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:16,357
Exactly.

94
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,024
But then, who's running the machines?

95
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,169
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.

96
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,668
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

97
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:29,370
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

98
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:34,444
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

99
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,141
...already packed and addressed.

100
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:42,745
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

101
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:47,020
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

102
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:51,557
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

103
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:55,696
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

104
00:12:56,137 --> 00:13:00,631
That little factory of yours, Charlie,
is as close as any of us is ever going to get.

105
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:06,040
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time
we let your grandparents get some sleep.

106
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,281
- Good night, Grandpa George.
- Night, Charlie.

107
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,545
- Night-night.
- Chair.

108
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,586
Thank you, dear.

109
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,988
Night, Grandpa Joe.

110
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,692
Good night, Grandma Georgina.

111
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:26,061
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.

112
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,517
- Good night.
- Night, Charlie.

113
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,279
Sleep well.

114
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>Indeed, that very night, the impossible
had already been set in motion.</i>

115
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:06,259
<i>Dear people of the world...</i>

116
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:08,192
<i>... I, Willy Wonka...</i>

117
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:12,972
<i>... have decided to allow five children
to visit my factory this year.</i>

118
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:16,804
<i>In addition, one of these children
shall receive a special prize...</i>

119
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,573
<i>... beyond anything
you could ever imagine.</i>

120
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,980
Five golden tickets have been hidden...

121
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,484
...underneath the ordinary wrapping paper
of five ordinary Wonka bars.

122
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,219
The bars may be anywhere...

123
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,789
...in any shop, in any street, in any
town, in any country in the world.

124
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,757
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie,
to open a bar of candy...

125
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,334
...and find a golden ticket inside?

126
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,266
I know, but I only get one bar a year,
for my birthday.

127
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:22,033
Well, it's your birthday next week.

128
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:25,669
You have as much chance
as anybody does.

129
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,782
Balderdash. The kids who are
going to find the golden tickets...

130
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,714
...are the ones who can afford
to buy candy bars every day.

131
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:35,982
Our Charlie gets only one a year.
He doesn't have a chance.

132
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,792
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.

133
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:42,924
Mark my words,
the kid who finds the first ticket...

134
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:45,691
...will be fat, fat, fat.

135
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,867
Augustus. This way.

136
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,808
I am eating the Wonka bar...

137
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:58,275
...and I taste something
that is not chocolate...

138
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,045
<i>... or coconut...</i>

139
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,947
...or walnut or peanut butter...

140
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,352
<i>... or nougat...</i>

141
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:11,248
...or butter brittle
or caramel or sprinkles.

142
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,490
<i>So I look...</i>

143
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,421
...and I find the golden ticket.

144
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,793
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

145
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,698
I eat more candy.

146
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,806
We knew Augustus would find
the golden ticket.

147
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,707
He eats so many candy bars a day...

148
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:35,645
...that it was not possible
for him not to find one.

149
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:38,980
Yes, it is good, Augustus.

150
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,678
<i>- golden ticket claimed and four more...</i>

151
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,153
Told you it'd be a porker.

152
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,423
What a repulsive boy.

153
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,487
Only four golden tickets left.

154
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:52,325
Now that they've found one,
things will really get crazy.

155
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,491
<i>- of every shape, size and hue.</i>

156
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,067
Veruca. Can you spell that for us, please?

157
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:04,769
V-E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.

158
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:10,114
As soon as my little Veruca told me she
had to have one of these golden tickets...

159
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:13,386
...I started buying all the Wonka bars
I could lay my hands on.

160
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,387
Thousands of them.
Hundreds of thousands.

161
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:20,958
I'm in the nut business, you see.
So I say to my workers:

162
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:24,588
Morning, ladies. From now on,
you can stop shelling peanuts...

163
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:27,893
...and start shelling the wrappers
off these chocolate bars instead.

164
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,442
<i>Three days went by, and we had no luck.
Oh, it was terrible.</i>

165
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,080
<i>My veruca got more
and more upset each day.</i>

166
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,723
Where's my golden ticket?

167
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,189
I want my golden ticket.

168
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:57,356
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see
my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

169
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,096
I vowed I would keep searching
until I could give her what she wanted.

170
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,903
<i>And finally, I found her a ticket.</i>

171
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:35,698
Daddy, I want another pony.

172
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,629
She's even worse than the fat boy.

173
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:43,769
I don't think that was really fair.
She didn't find the ticket herself.

174
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:48,377
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
That man spoils his daughter.

175
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:52,650
And no good ever comes
from spoiling a child like that.

176
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:01,191
Charlie, Mum and I thought...

177
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:04,229
...maybe you wanna open
your birthday present tonight.

178
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,137
Here you are.

179
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,109
Maybe I should wait till morning.

180
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:28,150
- Like hell.
- Pop.

181
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:34,117
All together, we're 381 years old.
We don't wait.

182
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,865
Now, Charlie,
you mustn't feel too disappointed...

183
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,030
...you know, if you don't get the...

184
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,301
Whatever happens,
you'll still have the candy.

185
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,500
Ah, well.

186
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,704
That's that.

187
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:27,174
- We'll share it.
- Oh, no, Charlie.

188
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:28,975
Not your birthday present.

189
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,217
It's my candy bar,
and I'll do what I want with it.

190
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,384
Thank you, darling.

191
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:43,921
Thank you, Charlie.

192
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,734
Bless you.

193
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:17,823
All right, let's see who found it.

194
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,735
"The third ticket was found
by Miss Violet Beauregarde."

195
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:50,063
These are just some of the 263
trophies and medals my Violet has won.

196
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,667
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when
I heard about these ticket things...

197
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,029
...I laid off the gum,
switched to candy bars.

198
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,405
She's just a driven young woman.
I don't know where she gets it.

199
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,136
I'm the Junior World Champion
Gum Chewer.

200
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,302
This piece of gum
I'm chewing right now...

201
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,382
...I've been working on for
three months solid. That's a record.

202
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:14,988
Of course, I did have my share
of trophies, mostly baton.

203
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:19,587
So it says that one kid's gonna get
this special prize, better than all the rest.

204
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:23,961
I don't care who those other four are.
That kid, it's gonna be me.

205
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,595
Tell them why, Violet.

206
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:27,364
<i>Because I'm a winner.</i>

207
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,665
What a beastly girl.

208
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,930
Despicable.

209
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,336
You don't know
what we're talking about.

210
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:37,972
Dragonflies?

211
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:39,840
<i>But wait, this is just in.</i>

212
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:45,475
<i>The fourth golden ticket has been found
by a boy called Mike Teavee.</i>

213
00:23:57,464 --> 00:24:00,262
All you had to do was track
the manufacturing dates...

214
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,870
...offset by weather
and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

215
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:06,136
A retard could figure it out.

216
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:10,003
Most of the time
I don't know what he's talking about.

217
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:13,112
You know, kids these days,
what with all the technology...

218
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,544
Die! Die! Die!

219
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:19,548
Doesn't seem like
they stay kids very long.

220
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,025
In the end,
I only had to buy one candy bar.

221
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:30,192
- And how did it taste?
- I don't know.

222
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:31,763
I hate chocolate.

223
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:35,868
Well, it's a good thing you're going to
a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...

224
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:49,705
<i>That question is,
who will be the winner of the last gold...?</i>

225
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,750
- Dad?
- Yes, Charlie?

226
00:24:58,158 --> 00:24:59,989
Why aren't you at work?

227
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:05,029
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory
thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

228
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:07,097
Like summer vacation?

229
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:10,133
Sure. Something like that.

230
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,476
<i>In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.</i>

231
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:22,778
<i>The upswing in candy sales
had led to a rise in cavities...</i>

232
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,976
<i>... which led to a rise in toothpaste sales.</i>

233
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:34,424
<i>With the extra money,
the factory had decided to modernize...</i>

234
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:38,556
<i>... eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.</i>

235
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:46,431
We were barely making
ends meet as it was.

236
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,666
You'll find another job.

237
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:53,006
Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just
thin down the soup a little more.

238
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:58,441
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket,
our luck will change.

239
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,411
I know it.

240
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:05,614
Charlie.

241
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:24,136
My secret hoard.

242
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:31,015
You and I are going to have
one more fling...

243
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:33,449
...at finding that last ticket.

244
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,449
You sure you want to spend
your money on that?

245
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:39,353
Of course I'm sure. Here.

246
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:43,092
Run down to the nearest store...

247
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:47,097
...and buy the first
Wonka candy bar you see.

248
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:50,794
Bring it straight back,
and we'll open it together.

249
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,909
Such a good boy, really.

250
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,344
Such a good...

251
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,353
Grandpa?

252
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:11,891
- You fell asleep.
- Have you got it?

253
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:19,355
Which end should we open first?

254
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,235
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.

255
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:55,592
Did you see that some kid in Russia
found the last golden ticket?

256
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,828
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.

257
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:01,497
Good boy. Come on, George. Good boy.

258
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:56,656
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious
Fudgemallow Delight, please.

259
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,321
Okay. Here you go.

260
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:06,701
The nerve of some people.

261
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:10,606
I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.

262
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,620
It's a golden ticket.

263
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:30,955
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.

264
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:33,624
In my shop too!

265
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:38,194
Listen. I'll buy it from you.
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.

266
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:41,466
Are you crazy?
I'd give him $500 for that ticket.

267
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:44,167
You wanna sell me your ticket
for $500, young man?

268
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:46,642
That's enough of that.
Leave the kid alone.

269
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:52,378
Listen. Don't let anyone have it.
Take it straight home, you understand?

270
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,184
Thank you.

271
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,657
Mom! Dad!

272
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:07,693
I found it!

273
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:10,393
The last golden ticket! It's mine!

274
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,053
Here.

275
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:38,023
Read it aloud.
Let's hear exactly what it says.

276
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:43,992
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of
this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.

277
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:48,634
I shake you warmly by the hand. For now,
I do invite you to come to my factory...

278
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,006
...and be my guest for one whole day."

279
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,444
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you
around the factory myself...

280
00:30:55,616 --> 00:30:57,641
...showing you everything
there is to see."

281
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:59,752
"Afterwards, when it is time to leave...

282
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,321
...you will be escorted home
by a procession of large trucks...

283
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,789
...each one filled with all the chocolate
you could ever eat."

284
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,659
"And remember, one of you lucky
five children will receive an extra prize...

285
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:14,027
...beyond your wildest imagination.

286
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,567
Now, here are your instructions."

287
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:20,673
"On the 1 st of February, you must come
to the factory gates at 10 a.m. Sharp.

288
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:24,208
You're allowed to bring one member
of your family to look after you.

289
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,642
Until then, Willy Wonka."

290
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:28,645
The 1 st of February.

291
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:32,583
- But that's tomorrow.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

292
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:36,587
Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your
hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.

293
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:40,249
- And get that mud off your pants.
- Now we must all try and keep very calm.

294
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:45,163
First thing that we have to decide is this:
Who is going with Charlie to the factory?

295
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:48,560
I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.

296
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:51,426
How about you, dear?
Don't you think you ought to go?

297
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:56,174
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know
more about it than we do, and...

298
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,169
Provided, of course,
he feels well enough.

299
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,142
No. We're not going.

300
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:11,753
A woman offered me $500
for the ticket.

301
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:14,120
I bet someone else would pay more.

302
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:16,558
We need the money more
than we need the chocolate.

303
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,006
Young man, come here.

304
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:35,542
There's plenty of money out there.

305
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,809
They print more every day.

306
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,719
But this ticket...

307
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:44,789
...there's only five of them
in the whole world...

308
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,290
...and that's all there's ever going to be.

309
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:53,191
Only a dummy would give this up
for something as common as money.

310
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,962
Are you a dummy?

311
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,201
No, sir.

312
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:02,841
Then get that mud off your pants.
You've got a factory to go to.

313
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,252
Daddy, I want to go in.

314
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,946
It's 9:59, sweetheart.

315
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,649
Make time go faster.

316
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,028
Do you think Mr. Wonka
will recognize you?

317
00:33:56,196 --> 00:34:00,155
Hard to say. It's been years.

318
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:09,303
Eyes on the prize, Violet.

319
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:11,740
Eyes on the prize.

320
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,023
<i>Please enter.</i>

321
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:46,435
<i>Come forward.</i>

322
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:53,582
<i>Close the gates.</i>

323
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,854
<i>Dear visitors...</i>

324
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,229
<i>... it is my great pleasure to welcome you
to my humble factory.</i>

325
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:13,562
<i>And who am I?</i>

326
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:16,738
<i>Well...</i>

327
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:22,244
<i>Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka</i>

328
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:24,349
<i>The amazing chocolatier</i>

329
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:26,508
<i>Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka</i>

330
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:28,654
<i>Everybody give a cheer!
Hooray!</i>

331
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,722
<i>He's modest, clever and so smart</i>

332
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:32,552
<i>He barely can restrain it</i>

333
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,694
<i>With so much generosity</i>

334
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:36,556
<i>There is no way to contain it!</i>

335
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,097
<i>To contain it
To contain, to contain, to contain!</i>

336
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,091
<i>Hooray!</i>

337
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,603
<i>Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka</i>

338
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,534
<i>He's the one that you're about to meet</i>

339
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,333
<i>Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka</i>

340
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:50,806
<i>He's the genius who just can't be beat</i>

341
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:52,740
<i>The magician and the chocolate wiz</i>

342
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:54,607
<i>The best darn guy who ever lived</i>

343
00:35:54,781 --> 00:36:00,413
<i>Willy Wonka, here he is!</i>

344
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:21,839
<i>The amazing chocolatier</i>

345
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:34,053
Wasn't that just magnificent?

346
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,884
I was worried it was getting a little dodgy
in the middle part, but then that finale...

347
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:45,060
Who are you?

348
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,768
- He's Willy Wonka.
- Really?

349
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:00,939
"Good morning, starshine.

350
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:03,309
The Earth says hello."

351
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,516
"Dear guests, greetings.

352
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:18,596
Welcome to the factory.
I shake you warmly by the hand.

353
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:25,069
My name is Willy Wonka."

354
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:26,933
Then shouldn't you be up there?

355
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:31,435
I couldn't very well watch the show
from up there, now, could I, little girl?

356
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:35,445
Mr. Wonka, I don't know
if you'll remember me...

357
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:38,482
...but I used to work here in the factory.

358
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:42,011
Were you one of those despicable spies
who tried to steal...

359
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:46,056
...my life's work and sell it to parasitic,
copycat, candy-making cads?

360
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:47,554
No, sir.

361
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:49,786
Then wonderful. Welcome back.

362
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:51,362
Let's get a move on, kids.

363
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,800
Don't you want to know our names?

364
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,669
Can't imagine how it would matter.
Come quickly. Far too much to see.

365
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,211
Just drop your coats anywhere.

366
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:18,722
- Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here.
- What?

367
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:23,989
I have to keep it warm in here. My workers
are used to an extremely hot climate.

368
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:26,359
They just can't stand the cold.

369
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,761
Who are the workers?

370
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,165
All in good time. Now...

371
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:36,572
Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.

372
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:41,537
- I don't care.
- Well, you should care.

373
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:44,182
Because I'm gonna win
the special prize at the end.

374
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,285
Well, you do seem confident,
and confidence is key.

375
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:53,417
I'm Veruca Salt.
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

376
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:56,259
I always thought a verruca
was a type of wart...

377
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:58,989
...you got on the bottom of your foot.

378
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,368
I am Augustus Gloop.
I love your chocolate.

379
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,266
I can see that. So do I.

380
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,534
I never expected to have
so much in common.

381
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:17,378
You. You're Mike Teavee.

382
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,078
You're the little devil
who cracked the system.

383
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:25,257
And you. Well, you're just lucky
to be here, aren't you?

384
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:29,918
And the rest of you must be their...

385
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:39,837
- Parents.
- Yeah.

386
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:41,997
Moms and dads.

387
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:45,200
Dad?

388
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,080
Papa?

389
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:58,251
Okay, then. Let's move along.

390
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,528
- Would you like some chocolate?
- Sure.

391
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:19,830
Then you should've brought some.

392
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,875
- Let's be friends.
- Best friends.

393
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:39,986
An important room, this.

394
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,027
- After all, it is a chocolate factory.
- Then why is the door so small?

395
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,131
That's to keep all the great big
chocolatey flavor inside.

396
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:13,386
Now, do be careful, my dear children.

397
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,322
Don't lose your heads.

398
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:17,394
Don't get overexcited.

399
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,424
Just keep very calm.

400
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:38,410
It's beautiful.

401
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:41,113
What?

402
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,579
Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.

403
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:55,764
Every drop of the river...

404
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:59,426
...is hot, melted chocolate
of the finest quality.

405
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:06,874
The waterfall is most important.

406
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:08,774
Mixes the chocolate.

407
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:11,939
Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.

408
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:13,746
By the way...

409
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:19,687
...no other factory in the world mixes
its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.

410
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:21,723
And you can take that to the bank.

411
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:33,696
People.

412
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:37,808
Those pipes...

413
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,906
...suck up the chocolate
and carry it away all over the factory.

414
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:46,311
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.

415
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,620
And do you like my meadow?
Try some of my grass.

416
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:55,351
Please have a blade. Please do.
It's so delectable and so darn good-Iooking.

417
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:57,495
You can eat the grass?

418
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,722
Of course you can.

419
00:42:59,898 --> 00:43:02,128
Everything in this room is eatable.

420
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:03,666
Even I'm eatable.

421
00:43:03,836 --> 00:43:06,634
But that is called cannibalism,
my dear children...

422
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:09,638
...and is, in fact, frowned upon
in most societies.

423
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:11,136
Yeah.

424
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:13,735
Enjoy.

425
00:43:14,413 --> 00:43:16,643
Go on. Scoot, scoot.

426
00:43:37,936 --> 00:43:39,403
Son.

427
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:42,034
Please.

428
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:45,837
Dad, he said, "Enjoy."

429
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:02,750
Why hold on to it?
Why not start a new piece?

430
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:08,022
Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
I'd be a loser, like you.

431
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:38,690
Daddy, look over there.

432
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:42,060
What is it?

433
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:43,792
It's a little person.

434
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:46,437
Over there, by the waterfall.

435
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:51,235
- There's two of them.
- There's more than two.

436
00:44:57,582 --> 00:45:00,210
- Where do they come from?
- Who are they?

437
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:03,818
Are they real people?

438
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:06,423
Of course they're real people.
They're Oompa-Loompas.

439
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:13,131
- Oompa-Loompas?
- Imported, direct from Loompaland.

440
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:15,892
- There's no such place.
- What?

441
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:19,560
Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school geography,
and I'm here to tell you...

442
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:24,903
Well, then you'll know all about it,
and, oh, what a terrible country it is.

443
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:38,253
<i>The whole place is nothing
but thick jungles...</i>

444
00:45:38,423 --> 00:45:42,018
<i>... infested by the most dangerous beasts
in the entire world.</i>

445
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:47,321
<i>Hornswogglers and snozzwangers
and those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.</i>

446
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:12,389
<i>I went to Loompaland looking for
exotic new flavors for candy.</i>

447
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:17,758
<i>Instead...</i>

448
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,954
<i>... I found the Oompa-Loompas.</i>

449
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:33,066
<i>They lived in tree houses to escape
from the fierce creatures who lived below.</i>

450
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:40,847
<i>The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but
green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.</i>

451
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,211
<i>The Oompa-Loompas looked
for other things...</i>

452
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:47,222
<i>... to mash up with the caterpillars
to make them taste better:</i>

453
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:50,828
<i>Red beetles,
the bark of the bong-bong tree.</i>

454
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:52,258
<i>All of them beastly...</i>

455
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:55,426
<i>... but not quite so beastly
as the caterpillars.</i>

456
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:32,100
<i>But the food they longed for the most
was the cocoa bean.</i>

457
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,336
<i>An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found
three or four cocoa beans a year.</i>

458
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,909
<i>But, oh, how they craved them.</i>

459
00:47:43,146 --> 00:47:46,240
<i>All they'd ever think about
was cocoa beans.</i>

460
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:55,955
The cocoa bean is the thing from which
chocolate is made, so I told the chief:

461
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:19,309
They are such wonderful workers.

462
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:22,417
I feel I must warn you, though,
they are rather mischievous.

463
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:24,519
Always making jokes.

464
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:28,279
Augustus, my child,
that is not a good thing you do!

465
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,294
Hey, little boy.

466
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:35,522
My chocolate must be untouched
by human hands.

467
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:43,972
He'll drown.

468
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:46,932
He can't swim.

469
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,668
Save him!

470
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:52,677
Augustus! No!

471
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:01,047
Augustus!

472
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:13,035
Augustus, watch out!

473
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:31,111
There he goes.

474
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:34,350
Call the fire brigade!

475
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:36,822
It's a wonder how
that pipe is big enough.

476
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:39,889
It isn't big enough. He's slowing down.

477
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,325
He's gonna stick.

478
00:49:42,932 --> 00:49:44,229
I think he has.

479
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:49,261
He's blocked the whole pipe.

480
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:54,276
Look. The Oompa-Loompas.

481
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:04,107
What are they doing?

482
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:10,444
They're going to treat us to a little song.
It is quite a special occasion.

483
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:12,853
They haven't had a fresh audience
in many a moon.

484
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:35,303
<i>Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop</i>

485
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:38,213
<i>The great big, greedy nincompoop</i>

486
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:43,287
<i>Augustus Gloop, so big and vile
So greedy, foul and infantile</i>

487
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:45,753
<i>"Come on!" we cried
"The time is ripe</i>

488
00:50:45,925 --> 00:50:48,485
<i>To send him shooting up the pipe!"</i>

489
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:50,959
<i>But don't, dear children, be alarmed</i>

490
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,721
<i>Augustus Gloop will not be harmed</i>

491
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:56,163
<i>Augustus Gloop will not be harmed</i>

492
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:29,624
<i>Although, of course, we must admit</i>

493
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:32,032
<i>He will be altered quite a bit</i>

494
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:35,163
<i>Slowly, wheels go round and round</i>

495
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:37,639
<i>And cogs begin to grind and pound</i>

496
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,540
<i>This greedy brute, this louse's ear</i>

497
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,177
<i>Is loved by people everywhere</i>

498
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,149
<i>For who could hate or bear a grudge</i>

499
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,384
<i>Against a luscious bit of fudge?</i>

500
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,183
Bravo! Well done!

501
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:37,581
Aren't they delightful?
Aren't they charming?

502
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:42,248
- I do say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.
- Like they knew it was gonna happen.

503
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,722
Oh, poppycock.

504
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,525
Where is my son?
Where does that pipe go to?

505
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,499
That pipe, it just so happens to lead...

506
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,935
...directly to the room
where I make delicious...

507
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:59,597
...strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

508
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:03,303
Then he will be made into
strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.

509
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,006
They'll be selling him by the pound
all over the world?

510
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,084
No. I wouldn't allow it.
The taste would be terrible.

511
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,850
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored,
chocolate-coated Gloop?

512
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:15,917
No one would buy it.

513
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:28,032
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop
up to the Fudge Room, okay?

514
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,694
Help her find her son.

515
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:35,469
Take a long stick and start poking around
in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?

516
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,820
Mr. Wonka?

517
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:57,690
Why would Augustus' name already
be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?

518
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:01,428
Improvisation is a parlor trick.
Anyone can do it.

519
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,800
You, little girl. Say something.

520
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:05,964
- Anything.
- Chewing gum.

521
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:09,204
<i>Chewing gum is really gross
Chewing gum, I hate the most</i>

522
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,404
See? Exactly the same.

523
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,014
No, it isn't.

524
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,779
You really shouldn't mumble.

525
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,147
Because I can't understand
a word you're saying.

526
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:23,154
Now, on with the tour.

527
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,831
- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?
- Of course they're joking.

528
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,467
That boy will be fine.

529
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,679
What's so funny?

530
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,183
I think it's from all those
doggone cocoa beans.

531
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:30,257
Hey, by the way, did you guys know
that chocolate contains a property...

532
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:35,227
...that triggers the release of endorphins?
Gives one the feeling of being in love.

533
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,088
You don't say.

534
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,869
All aboard.

535
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,609
Onward!

536
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,131
Here.

537
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:23,836
Try some of this. It'll do you good.
You look starved to death.

538
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:29,808
- It's great.
- That's because it's mixed by waterfall.

539
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,476
The waterfall is most important.

540
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,886
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up,
makes it light and frothy.

541
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:40,552
- By the way, no other factory in the world...
- You already said that.

542
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,765
- You're all quite short, aren't you?
- Well, yeah. We're children.

543
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,567
Well, that's no excuse.
I was never as short as you.

544
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,041
- You were once.
- Was not. Know why?

545
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,909
Because I distinctly remember
putting a hat on top of my head.

546
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:03,916
Look at your short, little arms.
You could never reach.

547
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,686
Do you even remember
what it was like being a kid?

548
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,951
Oh, boy, do I.

549
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,826
Do I?

550
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:20,901
<i>In fact, Willy Wonka hadn't thought
about his childhood for years.</i>

551
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,504
Trick or treat!

552
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,397
Trick or treat!

553
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:35,040
Trick or treat!

554
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,552
Who do we have here?

555
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:42,418
Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.

556
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,116
And who's that under the sheet?

557
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,389
Little Willy Wonka.

558
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:56,695
<i>Willy Wonka was the son
of the city's most famous dentist...</i>

559
00:57:56,872 --> 00:57:58,806
<i>... Wilbur Wonka.</i>

560
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,376
Now...

561
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,383
...let's see what the damage is
this year, shall we?

562
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,331
Caramels.

563
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:30,168
They'd get stuck in your braces,
wouldn't they?

564
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,976
Lollipops.

565
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,877
Ought to be called "cavities on a stick."

566
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,517
Then we have all this...

567
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,051
All this...

568
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,079
...chocolate.

569
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:53,051
You know, just last week, I was reading
in a very important medical journal...

570
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:57,928
...that some children
are allergic to chocolate.

571
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,762
Makes their noses itch.

572
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,400
Maybe I'm not allergic.

573
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:05,130
I could try a piece.

574
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,003
Really?

575
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,201
But why take a chance?

576
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,560
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?

577
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,062
- We're headed for a tunnel.
- Oh, yeah.

578
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,661
Full speed ahead.

579
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:41,342
- How can they see where they're going?
- They can't.

580
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:43,802
There's no knowing where they're going.

581
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,441
Switch on the lights!

582
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:14,667
People, keep an eye out.

583
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,903
We're passing some
very important rooms here.

584
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,042
What do you use hair cream for?

585
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,813
To lock in moisture.

586
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,554
- Whipped cream.
- Precisely.

587
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:38,459
That doesn't make sense.

588
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:41,329
For your information, little girl...

589
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:45,338
...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all
unless it's been whipped with whips.

590
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,635
Everybody knows that.

591
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,195
Stop the boat.
I wanna show you guys something.

592
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,215
Now, this is the most important room
in the entire factory.

593
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:08,851
Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves,
but just don't touch anything.

594
01:02:09,024 --> 01:02:10,252
Okay? Go on.

595
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,757
Go on, scoot.

596
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,137
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?

597
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,306
Let me show you.

598
01:02:31,113 --> 01:02:32,375
Thank you.

599
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,743
These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.

600
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,579
They're for children who are given
very little allowance.

601
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:41,189
You can suck on it all year,
and it'll never get any smaller.

602
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,788
- Isn't that neat?
- It's like gum.

603
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,953
No. Gum is for chewing.

604
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:49,359
If you tried chewing
one of these Gobstoppers...

605
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,557
...you'd break all your little teeth off.

606
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,066
But they sure do taste terrific.

607
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,745
And this is Hair Toffee.

608
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,245
You suck down one of
these little boogers...

609
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,349
...and in exactly half an hour...

610
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:12,248
...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out
over the top of your little noggin.

611
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,616
And a mustache. And a beard.

612
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,315
- Who wants a beard?
- Well...

613
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,656
...beatniks, for one.
Folk singers and motorbike riders.

614
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:25,027
You know, all those hip, jazzy, super-cool,
neat, keen and groovy cats.

615
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,634
It's in the fridge, daddy-o.
Are you hep to the jive?

616
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,896
Can you dig what I'm laying down?
I knew you could.

617
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,700
Slide me some skin, soul brother.

618
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,902
Unfortunately, the mixture isn't right yet.

619
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,345
Because an Oompa-Loompa
tried some yesterday, and, well, he...

620
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:47,347
How are you today?

621
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,523
You look great.

622
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,735
Watch this.

623
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,460
You mean that's it?

624
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:32,866
Do you even know what "it" is?

625
01:04:33,235 --> 01:04:35,226
- It's gum.
- Yeah.

626
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:39,397
It's a stick of the most amazing
and sensational gum in the whole universe.

627
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,736
Know why? Know why?

628
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:45,903
Because this gum is a full
three-course dinner all by itself.

629
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:49,917
Why would anyone want that?

630
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,826
"It will be the end of all kitchens
and all cooking.

631
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:03,692
Just a little strip of Wonka's magic
chewing gum and that is all you will...

632
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,993
...ever need at breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

633
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,571
This piece of gum happens to be
tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie."

634
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,673
It sounds great.

635
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:16,305
- It sounds weird.
- It sounds like my kind of gum.

636
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,979
I'd rather you didn't.
There are still some things that are...

637
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,609
I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum.
I'm not afraid of anything.

638
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,354
- How is it, honey?
- It's amazing!

639
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,158
Tomato soup.
I can feel it running down my throat.

640
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:38,765
Yeah. Spit it out.

641
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:41,494
- Young lady, I think you'd better...
- It's changing.

642
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:44,501
Roast beef, with baked potato.

643
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,467
Crispy skin and butter.

644
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:50,975
Keep chewing. My little girl's gonna be the
first person to have a chewing-gum meal.

645
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:53,614
Yeah. I'm just a little concerned
about the...

646
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,443
Blueberry pie and ice cream!

647
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:58,542
- That part.
- What's happening to her nose?

648
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,524
It's turning blue.

649
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,126
Your whole nose has gone purple.

650
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,657
What do you mean?

651
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:16,064
Violet, you're turning violet.

652
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,667
- What's happening?
- Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right.

653
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,903
Because it goes a little funny
when it gets to the dessert.

654
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:25,774
It's the blueberry pie that does it.

655
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,743
I'm terribly sorry.

656
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:40,691
Mother? What's happening to me?

657
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:54,874
She's swelling up.

658
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:00,276
Like a blueberry.

659
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:33,038
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas,
and each one ended up as a blueberry.

660
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,012
It's just weird.

661
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,152
But I can't have a blueberry
as a daughter.

662
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,911
How is she supposed to compete?

663
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:40,748
You could put her in a county fair.

664
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,771
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

665
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:02,909
<i>Yeah</i>

666
01:08:03,078 --> 01:08:05,239
<i>Listen close, and listen hard</i>

667
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,279
<i>To the tale of violet Beauregarde</i>

668
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:10,009
<i>This gentle girl
She sees no wrong</i>

669
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:12,585
<i>In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing</i>

670
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:14,984
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

671
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,125
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

672
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,852
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

673
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:22,121
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

674
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:24,963
<i>Yeah</i>

675
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,838
<i>She goes on chewing till, at last</i>

676
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:39,136
<i>Her chewing muscles grow so vast</i>

677
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:41,609
<i>And from her face
Her giant chin</i>

678
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:44,113
<i>Sticks out just like a violin</i>

679
01:08:44,283 --> 01:08:46,444
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

680
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:48,780
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

681
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:51,286
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

682
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:58,127
<i>For years and years she chews away</i>

683
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:00,663
<i>Her jaws get stronger every day</i>

684
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,994
<i>And with one great, tremendous chew</i>

685
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:05,364
<i>They bite the poor girl's tongue in two</i>

686
01:09:05,638 --> 01:09:07,697
<i>And that is why we try so hard</i>

687
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,438
<i>To save Miss violet Beauregarde</i>

688
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,839
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

689
01:09:13,012 --> 01:09:15,207
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

690
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:17,679
<i>Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing</i>

691
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,341
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

692
01:09:20,519 --> 01:09:22,510
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

693
01:09:22,688 --> 01:09:24,952
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

694
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:26,455
<i>Chewing, chewing all day long</i>

695
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,820
Mr. Wonka!

696
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,668
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde
into the boat...

697
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:40,602
...and take her along to
the Juicing Room at once, okay?

698
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,675
Juicing Room?
What are they gonna do to her there?

699
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,005
They're gonna squeeze her.

700
01:09:46,178 --> 01:09:48,146
Like a little pimple.

701
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:52,017
We gotta squeeze all that juice
out of her immediately.

702
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:56,879
Mother, help me.

703
01:09:57,056 --> 01:09:58,717
Please.

704
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:05,490
Come on.

705
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,329
Let's boogie.

706
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:10,863
Without the boat, we'll have to move
double-time to keep on schedule.

707
01:10:11,036 --> 01:10:12,333
There's far too much to see.

708
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:13,563
- Mr. Wonka?
- Yeah?

709
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,534
Why did you decide to let people in?

710
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:17,706
So they could see the factory,
of course.

711
01:10:17,977 --> 01:10:20,343
But why now? And why only five?

712
01:10:20,513 --> 01:10:22,811
What's the special prize, and who gets it?

713
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:26,076
The best kind of prize is a surprise.

714
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:28,352
Will Violet always be a blueberry?

715
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:30,614
No. Maybe. I don't know.

716
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:33,890
That's what you get from chewing gum
all day. It's disgusting.

717
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,526
If you hate gum so much,
why do you make it?

718
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:39,596
Once again, you shouldn't mumble.
It's starting to bum me out.

719
01:10:39,765 --> 01:10:42,666
Can you remember the first candy
you ever ate?

720
01:10:46,272 --> 01:10:47,500
No.

721
01:10:47,673 --> 01:10:53,839
<i>In fact, Willy Wonka did remember
the first candy he ever ate.</i>

722
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:57,104
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.

723
01:11:57,743 --> 01:11:59,506
I see.

724
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:01,779
These flashbacks happen often?

725
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,915
Increasingly...

726
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,843
...today.

727
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,089
This is a room I know all about.

728
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:18,389
For you see, Mr. Wonka,
I, myself, am in the nut business.

729
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:21,965
Are you using the Havermax 4000
to do your sorting?

730
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:23,761
No.

731
01:12:23,936 --> 01:12:25,335
You're really weird.

732
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:49,455
- Squirrels.
- Yeah. Squirrels.

733
01:12:49,628 --> 01:12:52,825
These squirrels are specially trained
to get the nuts out of shells.

734
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:11,739
Why use squirrels?
Why not use Oompa-Loompas?

735
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:16,377
Because only squirrels can get the whole
walnut out almost every single time.

736
01:13:17,056 --> 01:13:20,219
See how they tap them with their knuckles
to make sure it's not bad?

737
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:21,887
Oh, look. Look.

738
01:13:23,696 --> 01:13:25,288
I think that one's got a bad nut.

739
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,361
Daddy, I want a squirrel.

740
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:31,765
Get me one of those squirrels.
I want one.

741
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:34,934
Veruca, dear,
you have many marvelous pets.

742
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:39,066
All I've got at home is one pony and two
dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits...

743
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:42,645
...and two parakeets and three canaries
and a green parrot and a turtle...

744
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:45,909
...and a silly old hamster.
I want a squirrel!

745
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:47,713
All right, pet.

746
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:50,480
Daddy will get you a squirrel
as soon as he possibly can.

747
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:54,217
But I don't want any old squirrel,
I want a trained squirrel.

748
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:57,153
Very well.

749
01:13:57,429 --> 01:14:00,660
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want
for one of these squirrels?

750
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,801
Name your price.

751
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:06,263
Oh, they're not for sale.
She can't have one.

752
01:14:11,276 --> 01:14:12,868
Daddy.

753
01:14:14,546 --> 01:14:15,774
I'm sorry, darling.

754
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:18,409
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.

755
01:14:21,053 --> 01:14:24,580
If you won't get me a squirrel,
I'll get one myself.

756
01:14:33,465 --> 01:14:34,898
Veruca.

757
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:37,900
Little girl?

758
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:43,538
Veruca, come back here at once.

759
01:14:46,145 --> 01:14:47,772
Veruca.

760
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,091
Little girl?

761
01:15:01,593 --> 01:15:03,356
Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

762
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:05,622
It'll make him crazy.

763
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:23,414
I'll have you.

764
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,087
Veruca.

765
01:15:36,395 --> 01:15:37,726
Veruca.

766
01:15:39,932 --> 01:15:41,456
No!

767
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:47,203
Veruca!

768
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,702
Let's find the key.

769
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:54,509
Nope. Not that one.

770
01:15:55,614 --> 01:15:57,844
- Daddy!
- Veruca!

771
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:01,046
No. It's not that one.

772
01:16:12,664 --> 01:16:14,393
There it is.

773
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:15,794
There it isn't.

774
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:17,697
Daddy, I want them to stop.

775
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:29,880
What are they doing?

776
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:32,039
They're testing to see if she's a bad nut.

777
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:36,951
Oh, my goodness.
She is a bad nut after all.

778
01:16:44,129 --> 01:16:45,426
Veruca!

779
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:47,396
Daddy!

780
01:16:47,566 --> 01:16:49,090
Where are they taking her?

781
01:16:49,268 --> 01:16:52,066
Where all the other bad nuts go.
To the garbage chute.

782
01:16:53,038 --> 01:16:54,437
Where does the chute go?

783
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:55,834
To the incinerator.

784
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:59,008
But don't worry.
We only light it on Tuesdays.

785
01:16:59,178 --> 01:17:00,770
Today is Tuesday.

786
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:06,008
Well, there's always the chance
they decided not to light it today.

787
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:27,338
Now, she may be stuck in the chute
just below the top.

788
01:17:27,506 --> 01:17:31,101
If that's the case, all you have to do
is just reach in and pull her out.

789
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:33,205
Okay?

790
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:14,379
<i>Veruca Salt, the little brute</i>

791
01:18:14,553 --> 01:18:17,647
<i>Has just gone down the garbage chute</i>

792
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:21,919
<i>And she will meet, as she descends</i>

793
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:25,325
<i>A rather different set of friends</i>

794
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:28,432
<i>A rather different set of friends</i>

795
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,263
<i>A rather different set of friends</i>

796
01:18:32,437 --> 01:18:35,531
<i>A fish head, for example, cut</i>

797
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:38,801
<i>This morning from a halibut</i>

798
01:18:38,977 --> 01:18:42,242
<i>An oyster from an oyster stew</i>

799
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:46,145
<i>A steak that no one else would chew</i>

800
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:49,651
<i>And lots of other things as well</i>

801
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:55,953
<i>Each with its rather horrid smell</i>

802
01:18:56,128 --> 01:18:59,859
<i>Horrid smell</i>

803
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:03,395
<i>These are veruca's newfound friends</i>

804
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:07,129
<i>That she will meet as she descends</i>

805
01:19:07,306 --> 01:19:12,539
<i>These are veruca's newfound friends</i>

806
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:35,190
<i>Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?</i>

807
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:38,803
<i>Who pandered to her every need?</i>

808
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:42,167
<i>Who turned her into such a brat?</i>

809
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:44,138
<i>Who are the culprits?</i>

810
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:45,799
<i>Who did that?</i>

811
01:19:45,977 --> 01:19:49,242
<i>The guilty ones, now this is sad</i>

812
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:53,111
<i>Are dear old Mum and loving Dad</i>

813
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:05,993
Oh, really? Oh, good.

814
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:08,766
I've just been informed
that the incinerator's broken.

815
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:12,461
So there should be about three weeks
of rotten garbage to break their fall.

816
01:20:12,637 --> 01:20:14,127
Well, that's good news.

817
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:15,929
Yeah.

818
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:19,308
Well, let's keep on trucking.

819
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,814
I don't know why I didn't think of this.

820
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:27,440
The elevator's by far the most efficient way
to get around the factory.

821
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:29,450
There can't be this many floors.

822
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:32,449
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?

823
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:35,422
This isn't just an ordinary
up-and-down elevator, by the way.

824
01:20:35,594 --> 01:20:38,062
This elevator can go sideways,
longways, slantways...

825
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,822
...and any other ways
you can think of.

826
01:20:39,998 --> 01:20:42,899
You just press any button
and, whoosh, you're off.

827
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:54,340
Oh, look. Look.

828
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:58,741
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fudge Mountain.

829
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:29,576
I'd rather not talk about this one.

830
01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:43,087
This is the Puppet Hospital
and Burn Center.

831
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:50,430
It's relatively new.

832
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,598
The administration offices.

833
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:02,178
Hello, Doris.

834
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:40,280
Why is everything here
completely pointless?

835
01:22:40,452 --> 01:22:42,443
Candy doesn't have to have a point.

836
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:43,986
That's why it's candy.

837
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:45,622
It's stupid.

838
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:49,388
Candy is a waste of time.

839
01:22:50,028 --> 01:22:53,259
No son of mine is going to be
a chocolatier.

840
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:55,356
Then I'll run away.

841
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:57,661
To Switzerland. Bavaria.

842
01:22:57,903 --> 01:22:59,803
The candy capitals of the world.

843
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:01,870
Go ahead.

844
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,871
But I won't be here
when you come back.

845
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:33,734
Sorry, son.

846
01:23:33,905 --> 01:23:36,396
We're closing for the night.

847
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:03,494
I wanna pick a room.

848
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:08,005
Go ahead.

849
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:28,155
Here.

850
01:24:28,627 --> 01:24:31,528
Put these on quick, and don't
take them off whatever you do.

851
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:35,132
This light could burn your eyeballs
right out of your skulls.

852
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:38,402
And we certainly don't want that,
now, do we?

853
01:24:41,272 --> 01:24:44,969
This is the testing room for my very latest
and greatest invention:

854
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,845
Television Chocolate.

855
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:49,241
One day it occurred to me:

856
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:52,144
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

857
01:24:52,317 --> 01:24:56,219
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces
and send it whizzing through the air...

858
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:58,253
...then reassemble it
on the other end...

859
01:24:58,423 --> 01:25:00,482
...why can't I do the same
with chocolate?

860
01:25:00,925 --> 01:25:06,329
Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate
through the television, ready to be eaten?"

861
01:25:06,498 --> 01:25:10,229
<i>I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction.</i>

862
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,898
Sounds impossible.

863
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:14,702
It is impossible.

864
01:25:15,674 --> 01:25:18,336
You don't understand anything
about science.

865
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:22,947
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles.

866
01:25:23,748 --> 01:25:27,343
Second, the amount of power it would take
to convert energy in matter...

867
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,311
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

868
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:30,988
Mumbler!

869
01:25:31,823 --> 01:25:35,782
Seriously, I cannot understand
a single word you're saying.

870
01:25:39,397 --> 01:25:40,864
Okey-dokey.

871
01:25:41,032 --> 01:25:44,365
I shall now send a bar of chocolate
from one end of the room...

872
01:25:44,536 --> 01:25:47,596
...to the other by television.

873
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:49,137
Bring in the chocolate.

874
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:12,623
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

875
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:16,164
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

876
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:17,767
Same basic principle.

877
01:26:49,734 --> 01:26:51,326
It's gone.

878
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:56,430
Told you. That bar of chocolate is now
rushing through the air above our heads...

879
01:26:56,608 --> 01:26:59,042
...in a million tiny little pieces.

880
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:02,111
Come over here.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

881
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:09,448
Watch the screen.

882
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:14,451
Here it comes.

883
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:17,119
Oh, look.

884
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,929
- Take it.
- It's just a picture on a screen.

885
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:26,131
Scaredy-cat.

886
01:27:26,304 --> 01:27:27,794
You take it.

887
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,904
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

888
01:27:39,117 --> 01:27:40,607
Go on.

889
01:27:48,593 --> 01:27:50,424
Holy buckets.

890
01:27:53,464 --> 01:27:55,557
Eat it. Go on.

891
01:27:55,733 --> 01:27:57,894
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

892
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:01,368
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

893
01:28:09,714 --> 01:28:11,204
It's great.

894
01:28:11,382 --> 01:28:12,906
It's a miracle.

895
01:28:14,552 --> 01:28:17,521
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

896
01:28:17,689 --> 01:28:21,318
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

897
01:28:21,492 --> 01:28:25,553
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

898
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,631
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself."

899
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:33,228
And you simply reach out and take it.

900
01:28:34,138 --> 01:28:35,435
How about that?

901
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,541
So can you send other things?

902
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:39,506
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

903
01:28:39,844 --> 01:28:42,574
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

904
01:28:42,747 --> 01:28:46,012
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

905
01:28:46,184 --> 01:28:48,209
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

906
01:28:48,553 --> 01:28:50,544
- Of course I could.
- What about people?

907
01:28:51,022 --> 01:28:54,389
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

908
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:57,790
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

909
01:28:58,096 --> 01:29:00,963
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

910
01:29:01,132 --> 01:29:03,293
And all you think about is chocolate.

911
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:04,696
Calm down, Mike.

912
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,633
I think Mr. Wonka knows
what he's talking about.

913
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:10,239
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

914
01:29:10,408 --> 01:29:12,501
You think he's a genius,
but he's an idiot.

915
01:29:13,444 --> 01:29:15,207
But I'm not.

916
01:29:19,918 --> 01:29:21,351
Hey, little boy.

917
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,415
Don't push my button.

918
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:07,229
He's gone.

919
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:10,190
Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

920
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:13,769
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

921
01:30:13,938 --> 01:30:15,166
What do you mean?

922
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:20,043
Well, sometimes only half
of the little pieces find their way through.

923
01:30:21,212 --> 01:30:24,670
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

924
01:30:24,983 --> 01:30:26,883
What kind of a question is that?

925
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:30,745
No need to snap. Just a question.

926
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:34,558
Try every channel.
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

927
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:41,927
- There he is.
- Mike.

928
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:44,362
<i>The most important thing</i>

929
01:30:44,535 --> 01:30:45,763
<i>That we've ever learned</i>

930
01:30:45,937 --> 01:30:49,338
<i>The most important thing we've learned
As far as children are concerned</i>

931
01:30:49,507 --> 01:30:52,340
<i>Is never, never let them near
The television set</i>

932
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:56,002
<i>Or better still just don't install
The idiotic thing at all</i>

933
01:30:56,981 --> 01:30:59,677
<i>Never, never let them
Never, never let them</i>

934
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,356
<i>Never, never let them</i>

935
01:31:14,532 --> 01:31:15,794
<i>Never, never let them</i>

936
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:17,764
<i>It rots the senses in the head</i>

937
01:31:17,935 --> 01:31:19,129
<i>It keeps imagination dead</i>

938
01:31:19,303 --> 01:31:20,827
<i>It clogs and clutters up the mind</i>

939
01:31:21,005 --> 01:31:22,597
<i>It makes a child so dull and blind</i>

940
01:31:22,774 --> 01:31:24,139
<i>So dull, so dull</i>

941
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:27,334
<i>He can no longer understand
A fairy tale, a fairyland</i>

942
01:31:27,512 --> 01:31:29,070
<i>A fairyland, a fairyland</i>

943
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,679
<i>His brain becomes as soft as cheese</i>

944
01:31:30,848 --> 01:31:32,315
<i>His thinking powers rust and freeze</i>

945
01:31:32,517 --> 01:31:35,748
<i>He cannot think, he only sees</i>

946
01:31:40,558 --> 01:31:43,493
<i>Regarding little Mike Teavee</i>

947
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:46,289
<i>We very much regret that we</i>

948
01:31:46,864 --> 01:31:48,456
<i>Regret that we</i>

949
01:31:50,134 --> 01:31:51,726
<i>Shall simply have to wait and see</i>

950
01:31:51,903 --> 01:31:53,200
<i>Wait and see, wait and see</i>

951
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:55,669
<i>Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see</i>

952
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,205
<i>We very much regret that we</i>

953
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,002
<i>Shall simply have to wait and see</i>

954
01:31:59,177 --> 01:32:01,042
<i>If we can get him back his height</i>

955
01:32:01,212 --> 01:32:03,772
<i>But if we can't</i>

956
01:32:03,948 --> 01:32:04,972
<i>It serves him right</i>

957
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:06,711
Somebody grab him.

958
01:32:06,884 --> 01:32:08,715
<i>Help me.</i>

959
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,978
<i>Help me.</i>

960
01:32:11,923 --> 01:32:15,017
Oh, thank heavens.
He's completely unharmed.

961
01:32:15,193 --> 01:32:18,754
Unharmed? What are you talking about?

962
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:23,999
Just put me back in the other way.

963
01:32:24,168 --> 01:32:25,726
There is no other way.

964
01:32:25,903 --> 01:32:28,929
It's television, not telephone.
There's quite a difference.

965
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,132
And what exactly do you propose
to do about it?

966
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:33,402
I don't know.

967
01:32:34,345 --> 01:32:38,008
But young men are extremely springy.
They stretch like mad.

968
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:41,743
- Let's go put him in the taffy puller.
- Taffy puller?

969
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,717
Hey, that was my idea.

970
01:32:45,857 --> 01:32:47,222
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.

971
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:49,850
Yeah.

972
01:32:50,027 --> 01:32:52,291
Taffy puller.

973
01:32:53,197 --> 01:32:55,722
I want you to take Mr. Teavee
and his...

974
01:32:57,101 --> 01:32:59,729
...little boy up to the taffy puller, okay?

975
01:32:59,904 --> 01:33:01,701
Stretch him out.

976
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:14,451
On with the tour.

977
01:33:23,294 --> 01:33:25,626
There's still so much left to see.

978
01:33:25,796 --> 01:33:28,321
Now, how many children are left?

979
01:33:31,035 --> 01:33:35,438
Mr. Wonka,
Charlie's the only one left now.

980
01:33:37,775 --> 01:33:39,174
You mean, you're the only one?

981
01:33:40,077 --> 01:33:41,738
Yes.

982
01:33:42,013 --> 01:33:43,310
What happened to the others?

983
01:33:47,852 --> 01:33:50,446
Oh, my dear boy,
but that means you've won.

984
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:52,782
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.

985
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:54,288
I'm absolutely delighted.

986
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:57,018
I had a hunch right from the beginning.
Well done.

987
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:59,186
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.

988
01:33:59,363 --> 01:34:02,298
We have an enormous number
of things to do before the day's out.

989
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:06,527
But luckily for us, we have the great
glass elevator to speed things along...

990
01:34:12,977 --> 01:34:14,274
Speed things along.

991
01:34:17,114 --> 01:34:18,706
Come on.

992
01:34:24,922 --> 01:34:27,220
"Up and Out"? What kind of room is that?

993
01:34:27,758 --> 01:34:29,419
Hold on.

994
01:34:38,169 --> 01:34:39,932
Oh, my goodness.

995
01:34:40,104 --> 01:34:43,665
We're gonna need to go much faster,
otherwise we'll just never break through.

996
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:45,399
Break through what?

997
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:48,077
I've been longing to press
that button for years.

998
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:51,577
Well, here we go. Up and out.

999
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:54,316
- But do you really mean...?
- Yeah. I do.

1000
01:34:54,485 --> 01:34:55,975
But it's made of glass.

1001
01:34:56,153 --> 01:34:58,144
It'll smash into a million pieces.

1002
01:35:33,724 --> 01:35:36,693
Augustus, please don't eat your fingers.

1003
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:38,726
But I taste so good.

1004
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:54,376
Look, Mother.
I'm much more flexible now.

1005
01:35:54,912 --> 01:35:57,437
Yes, but you're blue.

1006
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:22,668
Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.

1007
01:36:23,341 --> 01:36:26,674
Veruca, the only thing you're getting today
is a bath, and that's final.

1008
01:36:26,844 --> 01:36:28,505
But I want it.

1009
01:36:45,496 --> 01:36:47,361
Where do you live?

1010
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,360
Right over there. That little house.

1011
01:36:55,706 --> 01:36:57,503
What time do you think they'll be back?

1012
01:36:57,675 --> 01:36:59,302
Hard to know, dear.

1013
01:37:10,988 --> 01:37:13,616
I think there's someone at the door.

1014
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,588
Hi, Mom.

1015
01:37:18,129 --> 01:37:20,393
Mom. Dad. We're back.

1016
01:37:20,564 --> 01:37:22,225
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

1017
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:25,159
Goodness.

1018
01:37:27,037 --> 01:37:29,733
This is Willy Wonka.
He gave us a ride home.

1019
01:37:30,207 --> 01:37:31,606
I see that.

1020
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:33,767
You must be the boy's...

1021
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:37,604
- Parents?
- Yeah. That.

1022
01:37:37,782 --> 01:37:40,717
He says Charlie's won something.

1023
01:37:42,153 --> 01:37:43,518
Not just some something.

1024
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:47,813
The most "something" something
of any something that's ever been.

1025
01:37:48,325 --> 01:37:51,158
I'm gonna give this little boy
my entire factory.

1026
01:37:53,297 --> 01:37:55,356
You must be joking.

1027
01:37:55,533 --> 01:37:56,830
No, really. It's true.

1028
01:37:57,001 --> 01:38:00,402
Because you see, a few months ago,
I was having my semiannual haircut...

1029
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:03,938
...and I had the strangest revelation.

1030
01:38:17,755 --> 01:38:19,586
<i>In that one silver hair...</i>

1031
01:38:19,757 --> 01:38:22,282
<i>... I saw reflected my life's work...</i>

1032
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:25,861
<i>... my factory,
my beloved Oompa-Loompas.</i>

1033
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:28,965
<i>Who would watch over them
after I was gone?</i>

1034
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:30,896
<i>I realized in that moment:</i>

1035
01:38:31,068 --> 01:38:33,559
I must find a heir.

1036
01:38:35,139 --> 01:38:37,266
And I did, Charlie.

1037
01:38:37,441 --> 01:38:38,806
You.

1038
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:43,104
That's why you sent out
the golden tickets.

1039
01:38:44,949 --> 01:38:46,849
What are Oompa-Loompas?

1040
01:38:47,017 --> 01:38:49,042
I invited five children to the factory...

1041
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:51,984
...and the one who was the least rotten
would be the winner.

1042
01:38:52,323 --> 01:38:53,756
That's you, Charlie.

1043
01:38:54,225 --> 01:38:55,783
So, what do you say?

1044
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,521
Are you ready to leave all this behind
and come live with me at the factory?

1045
01:38:59,697 --> 01:39:00,959
Sure. Of course.

1046
01:39:01,131 --> 01:39:03,793
I mean, it's all right
if my family come too?

1047
01:39:03,968 --> 01:39:06,232
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

1048
01:39:07,137 --> 01:39:08,798
You can't run a chocolate factory...

1049
01:39:08,973 --> 01:39:12,306
...with a family hanging over you
like an old, dead goose. No offense.

1050
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,307
None taken, jerk.

1051
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:18,871
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

1052
01:39:19,049 --> 01:39:22,018
He has to follow his dreams.
Gosh darn the consequences.

1053
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:24,749
Look at me.

1054
01:39:24,922 --> 01:39:27,447
I had no family, and I'm a giant success.

1055
01:39:28,826 --> 01:39:32,819
So if I go with you to the factory,
I won't ever see my family again?

1056
01:39:32,997 --> 01:39:35,363
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

1057
01:39:37,968 --> 01:39:39,196
Then I'm not going.

1058
01:39:40,304 --> 01:39:42,534
I wouldn't give up my family
for anything.

1059
01:39:43,374 --> 01:39:45,274
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

1060
01:39:47,811 --> 01:39:49,938
Oh, I see.

1061
01:39:51,849 --> 01:39:53,749
That's weird.

1062
01:39:56,887 --> 01:39:59,515
There's other candy too
besides chocolate.

1063
01:40:00,558 --> 01:40:03,391
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka. I'm staying here.

1064
01:40:10,234 --> 01:40:12,031
Well, that's just...

1065
01:40:12,803 --> 01:40:14,771
...unexpected...

1066
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,967
...and weird.

1067
01:40:25,049 --> 01:40:27,745
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

1068
01:40:30,154 --> 01:40:31,451
Goodbye, then.

1069
01:40:34,558 --> 01:40:36,082
Sure you won't change your mind?

1070
01:40:38,696 --> 01:40:40,254
I'm sure.

1071
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,599
Okay. Bye.

1072
01:41:13,263 --> 01:41:16,232
Things are going to get much better.

1073
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:22,566
<i>And for once, Grandma Georgina knew
exactly what she was talking about.</i>

1074
01:41:23,374 --> 01:41:27,743
<i>The next morning, Charlie helped
his parents fix the hole in the roof.</i>

1075
01:41:29,213 --> 01:41:32,273
<i>Grandpa Joe spent the whole day
out of bed.</i>

1076
01:41:32,449 --> 01:41:34,280
<i>He didn't feel tired at all.</i>

1077
01:41:36,153 --> 01:41:39,645
<i>Charlie's father got a better job
at the toothpaste factory...</i>

1078
01:41:39,823 --> 01:41:43,350
<i>... repairing the machine
that had replaced him.</i>

1079
01:41:45,162 --> 01:41:48,495
<i>Things had never been better
for the Bucket family.</i>

1080
01:41:48,832 --> 01:41:52,393
<i>The same could not be said
for Willy Wonka.</i>

1081
01:41:52,569 --> 01:41:54,764
I can't put my finger on it.

1082
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:57,503
Candy's the only thing
I was ever certain of...

1083
01:41:57,675 --> 01:42:00,109
...and now I'm just not
certain at all.

1084
01:42:00,277 --> 01:42:03,075
I don't know which flavors to make
or which ideas to try.

1085
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:05,909
I'm second-guessing myself,
which is nuts.

1086
01:42:07,384 --> 01:42:10,478
I've always made whatever candy
I felt like, and I...

1087
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,728
That's just it, isn't it?

1088
01:42:18,896 --> 01:42:23,424
I make the candy I feel like, but now
I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

1089
01:42:24,601 --> 01:42:27,195
You're very good.

1090
01:42:39,149 --> 01:42:41,174
Pity about that chocolate fellow,
Wendell... Walter.

1091
01:42:42,853 --> 01:42:44,878
- Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.

1092
01:42:45,689 --> 01:42:48,624
Says here in the paper his new candies
aren't selling very well.

1093
01:42:49,226 --> 01:42:52,855
But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg
who deserves it.

1094
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,897
- Yep.
- Oh, really?

1095
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,325
You ever met him?

1096
01:42:58,502 --> 01:43:00,129
I did.

1097
01:43:00,304 --> 01:43:05,003
I thought he was great at first,
but then he didn't turn out so nice.

1098
01:43:05,676 --> 01:43:07,644
He also has a funny haircut.

1099
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:09,142
I do not!

1100
01:43:10,147 --> 01:43:13,014
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.

1101
01:43:13,584 --> 01:43:15,848
What makes you feel better
when you feel terrible?

1102
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,653
My family.

1103
01:43:21,425 --> 01:43:23,188
What do you have against my family?

1104
01:43:23,994 --> 01:43:27,395
It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...

1105
01:43:30,667 --> 01:43:32,692
They tell you what to do,
what not to do...

1106
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,338
...and it's not conducive
to a creative atmosphere.

1107
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:39,773
Usually they're just trying to protect you
because they love you.

1108
01:43:41,745 --> 01:43:44,305
If you don't believe me, you should ask.

1109
01:43:44,481 --> 01:43:47,450
Ask who? My father?

1110
01:43:47,851 --> 01:43:49,512
No way.

1111
01:43:50,888 --> 01:43:52,355
At least, not by myself.

1112
01:43:53,323 --> 01:43:54,585
You want me to go with you?

1113
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,060
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

1114
01:44:03,734 --> 01:44:06,134
And you know what? I've got transport...

1115
01:44:10,007 --> 01:44:13,306
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

1116
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,165
I think we've got the wrong house.

1117
01:45:00,724 --> 01:45:02,191
Do you have an appointment?

1118
01:45:02,726 --> 01:45:04,819
No. But he's overdue.

1119
01:45:08,131 --> 01:45:10,156
Open.

1120
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:16,071
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

1121
01:45:56,647 --> 01:45:58,137
Heavens.

1122
01:45:58,315 --> 01:46:01,478
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

1123
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:07,352
Since...

1124
01:46:16,633 --> 01:46:17,895
Willy?

1125
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:21,237
Hi, Dad.

1126
01:46:32,249 --> 01:46:34,479
All these years...

1127
01:46:35,252 --> 01:46:37,345
...and you haven't flossed.

1128
01:46:39,456 --> 01:46:41,287
Not once.

1129
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:10,580
<i>It was on this day that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...</i>

1130
01:47:10,754 --> 01:47:13,518
<i>... who accepted on one condition.</i>

1131
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:15,988
Sorry we're late. We were brainstorming.

1132
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:18,093
Thought I heard thunder.

1133
01:47:18,261 --> 01:47:21,890
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.

1134
01:47:22,366 --> 01:47:24,459
I'll shuffle the plates.

1135
01:47:33,043 --> 01:47:36,342
You smell like peanuts.

1136
01:47:36,713 --> 01:47:40,080
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.

1137
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:41,911
You smell like...

1138
01:47:42,085 --> 01:47:43,916
...old people and soap.

1139
01:47:46,823 --> 01:47:48,450
I like it.

1140
01:47:53,096 --> 01:47:55,621
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1141
01:47:55,799 --> 01:47:57,824
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

1142
01:47:58,268 --> 01:47:59,860
With licorice instead of string.

1143
01:48:00,937 --> 01:48:04,429
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.

1144
01:48:04,975 --> 01:48:08,001
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

1145
01:48:19,289 --> 01:48:24,158
<i>In the end, Charlie Bucket
won a chocolate factory.</i>

1146
01:48:25,495 --> 01:48:30,228
<i>But Willy Wonka got something
even better:</i>

1147
01:48:30,867 --> 01:48:33,335
<i>A family.</i>

1148
01:48:34,671 --> 01:48:38,835
<i>And one thing was absolutely certain:</i>

1149
01:48:39,276 --> 01:48:43,269
<i>Life had never been sweeter.</i>

1150
01:55:20,743 --> 01:55:22,734
