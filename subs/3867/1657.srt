9
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,695
你听我说话了吗？

至少打个电话给姥姥
Call your grandma, at least.

14

这的粘稠的东西对你丈夫非常有好处……
This slimy thing here is very good for your husband...

15
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,130
一个高中女生遭遇了场可怕的事故……
A terrible incident happened to a high school girl...

16
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,810
-你好 -嗨

-没什么 -谢谢你
- It's nothing. - Thank you.

19
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,279
你为什么勾引我？因为我是老板的女儿吗？
Why did you tempt me? Because I'm the boss's daughter?

20
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,198
我当然喜欢了

我猜收购公司不是简单的事

谁知道你丈夫会是这么成功！

而你兄弟却一般般

In college he was all labor union, blah blah blah-

30
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,287
人生很讽刺
Life is ironic.

31
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,163
现在词语华丽了？
Using fancy words now?

32
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,340
可能是我正在变成首尔人吧
Guess I'm becoming a Seoulite.

33
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,252
请别说他们是兄妹
Please don't say they're siblings.

34

我们是兄妹
We're siblings.

35
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,424
-什么？不可能 -没道理
- What? No way. - It doesn't make sense.

如果你需要钱，要就是了，别那样偷偷摸摸的
If you need money, just ask. Don't sneak like that.

44
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,681

Who says I'm sneaking? I thought you were sleeping!

45
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,346
有什么不对吗？
Is something wrong?

46
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,019
我认为它是本真的书！
I thought it was a real book!

47

你是唯一的
You're the only one.

49
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,404
在那个年纪，一切都是混乱的、激情而为的事情
At that age, everything's turmoil and a passionate encounter.

50
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:27,907
她不得不顾感情，不牺牲一切，因为
She has to sacrifice everything despite her feelings because

51
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,286
她是个母亲
she's a mother.

52
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,707
那只是个连续剧而已
It's just a drama.

53
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:39,210
你认为你是毫无波折地长大成人的吗？
You think you grew up without any troubles?

54
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,049
我可不怎么惹麻烦
I wasn't a big troublemaker.

55
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,262
不，你是，你是个大惹事鬼
No you weren't. You were a huge troublemaker.

56
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,931
他们不会杀了她，是不是？
They're not gonna kill her, are they?

57
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,432
我只有一个月的时间了

58
00:07:51,930 --> 00:08:00,987
-什么事呀？ -我就知道！我就知道！

59
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,123
有人在吗？
Is someone there?

60
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,048
没人吗？
No one?

61
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,860
我正在看着你呢

64
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,165
医生们说什么？
What do doctors say?

65
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,171
或许两个月多点……？
Maybe two more months...?

66
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,431
很疼吗？
Does it hurt a lot?

67
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,600
嗯……
Well...

68
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,771
就像成千上万的针

刺你

00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,922
你也不像个癌症病人那么糟
You're not bad either for a cancer patient.

75
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,476

00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,608
看起来不错，嗯？
Looks good, huh?

285
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,483
郭女士，比上月好很多
Mrs. Kwak, much better than the last month.

286
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,863
金女士，你需要更加努力
And Mrs. Kim, you need to try harder than this.

287
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:14,324
大家鼓掌，苏女士是本月的销售女皇
Everybody applause. Mrs. Koh is the sales queen of the month!

288
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,993
金女士……
Mrs. Kim...

289
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,581
-金江美女士？ -对
- Mrs. Kim Jang-mi? - Yes.

290
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,125
-你知道我要说什么 -是的
- You know what I'll say. - Yes.

291
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,339
更努力点
Try harder.

292
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,837
我会的
I will.

293
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,389
你把太多的精力用到你到眼皮上了
You put too much effort into your eyelids.

294
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,218
那样说我不公平
It's unfair to pick on me like that.

295
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:39,520
我认为这才是不公平
I think this is unfair.

296
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,356
别笑了，这不好笑
Stop laughing. This isn't funny.

297
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,696
下一位是……
Next is Mrs...

298
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,083
我是金江美
This is KIM Jang-mi speaking.

299
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:06,801
二十五年没见你，你就要死了
Haven't seen you for 25 years and you're already dying.

300
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,091
你个婊子
You bitch.

301
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,808
你有人寿保险吗？
Do you have life insurance?

302
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,475
谁能想到我成了卖保险的了？
Who would've guessed that I'd end up selling insurance?

303
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,066
我老公做生意把我们所有的钱都赔了
My husband lost all our money on business.

304
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,648
你离婚是好事
Good thing you got divorced.

305
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,244
但是，他怎么不来呢？你老公
Still, how can he not show up? Your husband.

306
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:39,246
没有孩子，我们就如同陌生人一样
With no kids, we're as good as strangers.

307
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,994
但是你难道不孤单吗？
Aren't you lonely, though?

308
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,627
我完全沉迷于工作
I was completely consumed with work.

309
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,095
现在回头看看，我猜我的确如此
Now I look back, I guess I was.

310
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:57,928
嗨，保险女，难道没有帅哥给我吗？
Hey, insurance lady, don't have a hot guy for me?

311
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,730
在死之前，我还能做些火热的爱
I could use some scorching love affair before I pass.

312
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,809
我满载而终，也不是件坏事，嗯？
I'm loaded and terminal. Not a bad deal, huh?

313
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,736
以牙还牙，婊子！
Right back atcha, bitch!

314
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:19,415
咱们找到她们，春花承担费用
Let's find them. Chun-hwa's paying for the fee.

315
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,618
难道你不想念她们吗？
Don't you miss them?

316
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,703
我得照顾我的家庭
I need to take care of my family.

317
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,422
什么，他们不能照顾自己吗？
What, they can't take care of themselves?

318
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,127
别烦了，我自己会找到她们
Don't bother. I'll find them alone.

319
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,337
怎么找？
How?

320
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,139
要花大约一个月的时间
It takes about a month to find

321
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,884
去找四个人，无论她们住在哪里
four people, no matter where they live.

322
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:43,397
你已经知道价钱
And you already know the price.

323
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,481
我老婆把我的衬衣弄缩水了
My wife shrunk my shirt.

324
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,980
我们也收信用卡……
We also accept credit cards...

325
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,236
抱歉
Excuse me.

326
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,239
我叫你待在里边的！
I told you to stay inside!

327
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,870
他找到了我和我丈夫
He found me and my husband

328
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,747
那时我们在躲债
when we were hiding from our creditors.

329
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,133
哦，那记忆……
Oh, the memories...

330
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,793
你喜欢那样？
You like that?

331
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,548
不管怎么说，他擅长找人
Anyway, he's good at finding people.

332
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:24,184
有些表演是必须的，那是为了让它看起来
Some acting's necessary in order to make it look

333
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,769
更“自然”，因为……
more "natural" because...

334
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,859
抱歉
Excuse me.

335
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,410
那么，这也是计划的表演？
So that was planned acting too?

336
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,741
在后边
That's on the back.

337
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,789
-你为什么不叫醒我？！ -吃了这个，就一口
- Why didn't you wake me'?! - Eat this. One bite.

338
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,831
袜子！
Socks!

339
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,834
我叫醒你时就起床！给
Get up when I wake you! Here.

340
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,587
你为什么不把内裤也给我？
Why don't you give me panties too?

341
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,975
你已经低血糖了，你得吃点，娜美！
You've got diabetes. You gotta eat, Na-mi!

342
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,641
我知道！你为什么不叫醒我？
I know! Why didn't you wake me up?

343
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,263
别给她吃
Don't feed her.

344
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,062
革命者还在监狱里挨饿呢
The revolutionaries are starving in jail.

345
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,856
闭嘴，你才是那个正在吃东西的人
Shut up. You're the one who's eating.

346
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,735
操！我不想吃
Fuck! I don't want to eat.

347
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,029
妈妈，成熟点！
Mom, grow up!

348
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,949
-我的夹克在哪？ -洗衣房！
- Where's my jacket? - Laundry!

349
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,116
哦，该死
Oh gosh.

350
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,744
让开，爸爸！
Move Dad!

351
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,578
她又迟到了
She's late again.

352
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,255
嗯，看起来很好
Yum, that looks good.

353
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,254
我的工具包在哪？
Where's my tool bag?

354
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,127
我迟到了！
I'm late!

355
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:38,466
工具包
TOOL BAG

356
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,556
学学这个，准备考试
Study this for your exam.

357
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,094
学学这个，准备考试
Study this for your exam.

358
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,601
今天就到此结束
We're done for the day.

359
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,141
你们的老师今天生孩子
Your teacher's having a baby today.

360
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,694
安全过周末，别玩得太猛了
Have a safe weekend. Don't play too hard.

361
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,107
好的
Okay.

362
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,498
谢谢你，江美
Thank you, Jang-mi.

363
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,003
这一天总算来了！
The day has come!

364
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,497
你们都带“工具”了吗？
You guys all brought "tools"'?

365
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,623
我只带了这个
I only brought this.

366
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,625
你就用那个打架吧，疯子
You go fight with that, crazy.

367
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,093
你到底在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

368
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,928
对不起，我也忘了
Sorry. I forgot, too.

369
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,302
该死，这可不妙
Shit, this isn't good.

370
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,934
我们需要七个人和她们七个打吗？
Do we need seven of us to fight with seven of them?

371
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,180
她们把名字改的更恶心了
They changed their name to a suckier one.

372
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,978
-咱们先改！ -好，好！啥名字？
- Let's get changed first! - Okay, okay! What's that?

373
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,193
-这是不是太可爱了？ -哦，老天，这很完美！
- Isn't this so pretty? - Oh my god, that's perfect!

374
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,168
为什么我们带她？
Why are we taking her?

375
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,377
只是为了让她们知道我们也是七个
Just to show them we also have seven.

376
00:31:56,665 --> 00:32:03,048
通常我们不是真打，但你可以藏在后边
We usually don't fight for real but you can hide at the back.

377
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:08,094
我们真打吧！我们有许多工具！
Let's fight for real! We have many tools!

378
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:16,356
你有什么吃的吗？
Do you have anything to eat?

379
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,857
真没有
Not really.

380
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,149
嗨，我看起来像你的流动午餐盒吗？
Hey, do I look like a walking lunch box to you?

381
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,580
没还鞋，可别走，夫人
Don't go without returning your shoes, ma'am.

382
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,371
操，她们已经在这了
Fuck. They're already here.

383
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,873
女孩时代！
Girls' Generation!

384
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,686
夏春花
HA Chun-hwa.

385
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:57,272
为什么我们非得像塞伦盖蒂的老虎一样打架？
Why do we have to fight like the tigers of Serengeti?

386
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,311
要学会分享
Learn to share.

387
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,069
在你们停止从我们伙伴那偷窃前，不行
Not before you stop stealing from our kids.

388
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:09,740
另外，是狮子，不是老虎，笨蛋
Besides it's lions, not tigers, you idiot.

389
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,619
在塞伦盖蒂一定有老虎
There must be some tigers in Serengeti.

390
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,128
那是谁？
Who's that?

391
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,757
你带个小孩来吓唬我们？
You brought a kid to scare us?

392
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,256
看起来她想尿尿！
Looks like she wants to pee!

393
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,089
我不想带她，但是……
I wasn't gonna bring her, but...

394
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,052
你听说过“摄魂”吗？
Have you heard of "possession"'?

395
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:39,276
当然，坐下、躺下、蹲下……
Of course. Sitting, lying, squatting...

396
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,440
不是摄影，笨蛋，是“摄魂”
Not position, you fool. "Possession."

397
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,109
是什么鬼东西？
What the fuck is that?

398
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,406
摄取灵魂
Possessed by spirits.

399
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,901
拥有灵魂
Spirit possession.

400
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,539
在老家她非常出名
She's actually quite famous in her old town.

401
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,959
看到她如何抖动的吗？那是在做准备
Look how she's shaking? That's preparing.

402
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,958
准备干什么？
Preparing for what?

403
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
幽灵
Ghost.

404
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,172
她不穿袜子，因为每天早上她都在刀上行走
She doesn't weer socks because she walks on knife every morning.

405
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,794
不要用你的眼睛看她
Don't look her in the eyes.

406
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,384
你会被勾魂的
You'll get possessed.

407
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,968
对，好的
Yeah, right.

408
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,742
你知道吗，你总是像一个意大利面盘子？
Do you know you always look like a pasta plate?

409
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,948
你为什么不把头盔摘了？
Why don't you take off your helmet?

410
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,452
为什么你不先吐点乒乓球出来？
Why don't you spit out those ping pong balls first?

411
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,163
你的颧骨能杀人
Your cheekbones can kill people.

412
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,132
喔，你个疯婊子
Wow, you crazy bitch.

413
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,630
你嘴可真脏呀
You have a very filthy mouth.

414
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,759
不比你的脸更脏
Not more than your face.

415
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,802
你真是个奇女子呀
What a special haybag you are.

416
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,305
你更特殊
And you're extra special.

417
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,808
操你妈
You fucking mother fucker.

418
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,855
操你妈个傻逼
You fucking mother fucker sucker!

419
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,442
你个长角的狗，我要生吞了你
You horn dog, I'll eat you alive!

420
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,281
以牙还牙！
Right back atcha!

00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,191
那你怎么样？你的孩子多大了？
So how are you? How old is your kid?

557
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,810
十七岁
Seventeen.

558
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,312
你隆胸了？现在都变成西瓜大了
You did your breasts? They're watermelons now!

559
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,440
太粗鲁了
That's so rude.

560
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,365
-娜美，你的丈夫做什…… -我们从未在一个学习组
- Na-mi, what does your husban... - We were never a study group.

561
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,988
操妈的狗屎！
Fuck this shit!

562
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,201
别这样，好吗？
Stop it, ok?

563
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,501
珍熙
Jin-hee.

564
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,963
你难道不想见春花吗？
Don't you wanna meet Chun-hwa?

565
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:56,842
我不敢相信你们通过侦探找到我
I can't believe you found me through a detective.

566
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,341
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong with that?

567
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,682
被陌生人跟踪感觉不好
It feels wrong to be followed by a stranger.

568
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:08,357
我们必须尽快找到你，那是唯一的方法
We had to find you fast and that was the only way.

569
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,023
你们应该也发现了其他的事情
You should've found something else.

570
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,232
你们有他们的名片吗？
Do you have their card?

571
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:21,078
要是他们有我的信息，我晚上睡不着觉
I can't sleep at night if they have my information.

572
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,700
日后再聊
Talk to you later then.

573
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,963
这能成
This will Work.

574
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,750
我找到另两个会通知你
I'll let you know when I find other two.

575
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:39,427
你能再多找一个人吗？
Can you find one more person, separately?

576
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,557
我只知道他的名字和年龄
I only know his name and age.

577
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,220
当然了……抱歉
Well of course... Excuse me.

578
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:51,021
哦，你还在这？
Oh, you're still here?

579
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,777
当然，我不会告诉任何人
Of course I won't tell anyone.

580
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,525
我会杀了你的！
I Will kill you!

581
00:46:55,688 --> 00:47:00,114
给你！我认为你写错了车牌号
Here you are! I think you wrote the plate number wrong.

582
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,702
想知道他是否有婚外情，那是必须的
It's a necessity to find out if he's having an affair.

583
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,614
你在这干什么？
What are you doing here?

584
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,927
快点
Hurry up.

585
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,426
我走着呢
I'm going.

586
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,971
你不会告诉江美，是吗？
You're not gonna tell Jang-mi, right?

587
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,397
看看再说
We'll see.

588
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:36,446
-我这么做只是以防万一 -我说什么了吗？
- I'm doing it just in case. - Did I say anything?

589
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,781
谁呀？
Who is it?

590
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:51,502
我们来这布道的
We're here to spread the message from God.

591
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,871
我去过教堂了
I already go to church.

592
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,420
说这样更好
Say it nicer.

593
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,179
上帝爱你许多
God loves you a lot.

594
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,728
你们来自哪个教堂？
Which church are you from?

595
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,857
来喝点吧
Please have some.

596
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:27,448
房间很小，对吧？我们只在这短期居住
It's tiny, right? We're only staying for a while.

597
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,948
不，很不错
No, it's fine.

598
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,038
-很高兴见到你 -我明白
- Good to see you. - I know.

599
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,247
娜美，你看起来这么年轻
Na-mi, you look so young.

600
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,757
珍熙……
And Jin-hee...

601
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,594
我都认不出你了
I barely recognized you.

602
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:48,514
你在照看你的外甥吗？
Why are you babysitting your nephew?

603
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,853
我小姑子怀孕了，所以有段时间……
My sister-in-law is pregnant. So for a while...

604
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,142
金玉！
Geum-ok!

605
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,348
抱歉
Excuse me.

606
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:02,866
你难道不羞愧吗？你丈夫和小姑子
Aren't you ashamed? Your husband and sister-in-law

607
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,446
在辛苦的工作，但你却和朋友聊天
are doing all the hard work while you hang out with your friends.

608
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,071
招聘：老师和专家

609
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,538

Sorry.

610
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,076
-来点咖啡 -好的
- Have some coffee. - Right.

611
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,914
你为什么把门关上？！
Why did you close the door?!

612
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,665
我说错了吗？
Did I say anything wrong?

613
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,716
天哪，她要把我关起来！
My god, she's locking me up!

614
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:30,059
孩子哭了，去抱她
Baby's crying. Go get him.

615
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,389
嗨，姐妹们
Hey guys.

616
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,686
你们能离开吗？
Can you please leave?

617
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:45,478
这不是她，不是我们认识的医生的女儿
That's not her. Not the denist's daughter we knew.

618
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:56,912
都是生活中该死的虚荣，是不是？
All is fucking vanity in life, isn't it?

619
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,540
现在你听起来像我的朋友了
Now you sound like my friend.

620
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:06,922
遇到你们这些姑娘后，我又一切如旧了
It's all coming back to me after meeting you girls.

621
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,344
嗨
Hey,

622
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,434

我没时间去看她
I can't find time to visit her.

624
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,401
你能代我把这个给她吗？
Can you give this to her for me?

625
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,114
求你了？
Please?

626
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,611
你难道不能来一小会吗？
Can't you stop by briefly?

627
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:34,328
如果我不呆在家，或许吧……
Perhaps if I didn't stay home...

628
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,702
我会给她打个电话，好吗？
I'll give her a call, OK?

629
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,748
我会再见到你们的，保重
And, I'll see guys again. Take care.

我不吃饭了
I'm not eating.

633
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,317
-怎么了？ -没事
- What happened? - Nothing.

634
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,903
-你的脸有伤 -没事
- Your face is bruised! - It's nothing.

635
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,700
肯定有事，怎么了？
It's not nothing! What happened?

636
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,993
我摔了一跤！
I fell down!

637
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:21,667
艺彬，怎么了？发生什么事了？

00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,875
这里不接待中学生
Middle school kids are not allowed here.

641
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,291
我不是中学生
I'm not in middle school.

642
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,217
你想要什么？
What do you want?

643
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,178
来杯咖啡，黑的

你们是谁？
Who are you?

660
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,199
难道春花没告诉你，这是我们的地盘？
Didn't Chun-hwa tell you this is our area?

661
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,497
-你妈…… -你个小烂货！

667
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,880
你给电台写信了？

668
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:28,307
我们也要把名字变成英文的

别那样看！
Stop staring like that!

679
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,407
我猜你没搞明白形势
I guess you don't realize the situation.

680
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,369
-没人会来…… -嗨！

……来救你

682
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:49,304
这真是预料之中了，你不觉着吗？
This is too predictable, don't you think?

683
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,437
我一有麻烦就来了
Come back when I'm the one in trouble.

684
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,889
新川女子职业高中？
Shinchang Girl's Vocational High?

685
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,108
对，那怎么了？

你知道宋真玉吗？

我干的
I did that.

689
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,322
现在她还一喝东西就会从脸上溅出来
She still can't drink without spilling through her face.

690
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,953
该死
Bullshit.

691
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,918

是看年轻十一的时候了

694
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,943
等等我们！
Wait for us!

695
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,112
你还好吗？
Are you ok?

696
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,367
现在的孩子为什么这么吓人？

你的头发上有口香糖

我认为是你被欺负时弄上的

706
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,846
你需要用丙酮才能除掉它

707
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,266
又低血糖了？

708
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,854

01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,690
不，你不明白

那个婊子勾引我儿子……

如果你看到你儿子，打电话给我们

我没事的

你看到过像这样的吗？

759
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,704
你在看什么？

我们去警局吧，我把一切都解释了
Let's go to the police. I've explained everything

762
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,048
我的儿子被坏人引诱了
that my good son was tempted by the wrong croud.

763
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:52,097

Stop it, mom! Nobody tempted me into anything.

764

01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,882
我不在的时候照顾好姥姥

你要去哪？

01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:36,053
我决定献身于民主和劳动者权利

772
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,028
带妈妈进去

她在家，我给过她电话了
She's at home. I gave her a call.

784
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,383
你还好吗？

785
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,388
不是你的生活方式，是吧？
Not the way to live your life, is it?

786
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,612
对不起，汉斯

787
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,573
去死吧
Go to hell.

01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,342
金玉给了我一千块钱

789

她做了朋友能做的事了

790
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,341
你会穿不同的衣服，对吗？

别动，我好久都没干这个了

793
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:47,900
嗯？
Yep?

794
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,483
你有想要做的事吗？

795
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:59,572
我太老了，没法有梦想了
I'm too old to have dreams.

796
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,577
不要没梦想地活着
Don't live without dreams.

797
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:12,084
人生苦短，无梦难活

798

叫你别动了

799
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,931

01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,684
娜美……
Na-mi...

801
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,529
该死的混蛋有外遇
This fucking bastard is having an affair.

802
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:36,028
-谁？ -操！
- Who? - Fuck!

803
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,985
你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?

804
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,489
对不起，春花
I'm sorry, Chun-hwa.

805
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,451
我真不想在我们重逢时说这些事情
I really didn't want to say stuff like this on our reunion.

806
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:50,206
别担心，我们都是朋友
Don't worry. We're all friends.

807
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,671
你也去搞外遇！
You go have an affair too!

808
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,261
谁想加入？
Who wants to join?

809
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,264
娜美？江美？
Na-mi? Jang-mi?

810
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,182
我还真有点想
I kinda want it.

811
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,646
但如果你也搞外遇，那你还能得到赡养费吗？
But if you do it, will you still get alimony?

812
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,099
该死，就是了
Shit, that's right.

813
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:13,315
我怎么才能报复这个该死的鸡巴玩意？
How am I going to pay back this whistle dick?

814
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,446
我们应该去一起报复吗？
Should we go and pay back together?

815
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,446
如果有人欺负我们中的一个，我们要一起报复，对吗？
If they bully one of us, we pay back together, right?

816
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,028
没错，娜美！
That's right, Na-mi!

817
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,741
你想怎么办呢？
How do you want it done?

818
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,709
像这样？
Like this?

819
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,372
或者像这样？！
Or like this?!

820
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:36,001
我什么都不怕，告诉我，我来办
I'm not scared of anything. Tell me and I'll do it.

821
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,127
那样不疼
It won't hurt like that.

822
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:42,432
你要像这样扭它，像这样！
You have to twist it like this. Like this!

823
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,101
别再折腾我老公的鸡巴了！
Stop mutilating my hubby's dick!

824
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:50,690
韩国姑娘总会在最后一刻保护老公
Korean girls always protect their husbands at the last moment.

825
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:55,778
你们这些婊子们，我的婊子们！
You bitches, my bitches!

826
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,564
你的电话无法接通……
Your call wasn't connected...

827
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,821
你为什么不接电话？
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

828
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,580
我会把车停在后面，打电话给我
I'll park at the back. Call me.

829
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,429
为什么你没有？
Why do you not have it?

830
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,109
-你疯了吗？ -妈的滚蛋！
- Are you nuts? - Fuck off!

831
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,859
-带钱给我，好吗？ -嗨！
- Bring me money, ok? - Hey!

832
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,579
艺彬，你还好吗？
Yae-bin, are you ok?

833
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,496
你们为什么这么做？过来呀！
Why did you do this? Come here!

834
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,953
-操…… -你为什么这么做？
- The fuck... - Why are you doing this?

835
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,129
她们是谁？
Who are they?

836
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,798
你关心什么？
What do you care?

837
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,761
这是怎么回事？她们是谁？
What's this? Who are they?

838
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:05,176
如果我告诉你她们是谁，你要做什么？
If I tell you who they are, what can you do?

839
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,307
杀了她们？
Kill them?

840
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,644
你就别管了
Just go away.

841
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,055
艺彬！
Yae-bin!

842
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,823
嗨，保险女
Hey, insurance lady.

843
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:37,338
像你这样的高贵要人在这做什么？
What's a noble personage like you doing here?

844
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:40,257
今天是流血的好日子
It's a good day to shed blood.

845
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,338
你穿的很不合适呀
You're dressed inappropriately

846
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,339
闭嘴！我们用老方法解决
Shut up! We'll do it the old way.

847
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,346
怎么办？
How?

848
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,550
我要骂死她们
I'll forstall them with my words.

849
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:53,646
这才是我的姐妹！
That's my girl!

850
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,515
顺便问一句，这些不是真的，是吗？
By the way, those aren't real, are they?

851
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,851
闭上你的臭嘴！
Shut your pie hole!

852
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:04,149
另外，其他人在哪？
Anyway, where are the others?

853
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,760
妈的怎么回事？
What the fuck?

854
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,550
我觉着她们可能认出我
Thought they might recognize me.

855
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:33,846
粗人！你老公很幸运
Saucy! Your husband is a lucky guy.

856
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:35,976
嗨，我的婊子们！
Hello, my bitches!

857
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,776
天那，你要笑死我呀！
God, you're killing me!

858
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,232
看看你！
Look at you!

859
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,824
你真是一个好学妹
You're a goddamn schoolgirl.

860
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,449
但相当可爱，你还真像呀
Kinda cute, though. You can still pull it off.

861
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,748
她说她累了，另外，我们不能不带领队呀
She said she was bored. Besides, we can't leave out the leader.

862
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:58,869
当然
Sure.

863
01:14:58,869 --> 01:14:59,916
她整好奶子了
She got her boobs done.

864
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,880
-别搞笑了！ -那么咋样？
- No kidding! - So what?

865
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:07,094
-让我看看 -姐妹们，是她们！
- Let me see. - Guys, it's them!

866
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:11,429
-是她们？ -待在后面，春花
- That's them? - Stay in the back, Chun-hwa.

867
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,767
丢掉癌症患者不能打架的偏见吧
Lose the prejudice that cancer patients can't fight.

868
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,143
表演时刻到了
It's show time.

869
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:28,566
这是无烟区，婊子们！
It's a non-smoking area, bitches!

870
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,228
-你妈个逼的！ -操！
- You fucking motherfucker! - Fuck!

871
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,480
-你个狗屎笨蛋！ -STFU!
- You skanky shiznit twat! - STFU!

872
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,645
这个婊子到底在说什么？
What the hell is this bitch saying?

873
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,339
我只是来洗车，有人打电话给我
I just came to wash the car and got called.

874
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:39,896
我认为她们没疯，但有一个穿着校服
I don't think they're crazy, but one's wearing a uniform.

875
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,860
或许是COSPLAY
Maybe it's a costume play.

876
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,491
不管怎么说，我一会到那
Anyways, I'll be there soon.

877
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,168
牌子包真是很棒
Designer bags are awesome.

878
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,538
打破了脑袋了吧
Cracks open the brain at once.

879
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,590
好玩吗？
Is it funny?

880
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,265
警官，这不在保险理赔范围内，是吧？
Officer, this doesn't get covered by insurance, right?

881
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,556
你怎么能有这种奢望？这是暴力行为
How can you expect that? This is an act of violence.

882
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:23,644
有些保险含伤害……
Some insurance can cover injuries...

883
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,731
你有保险吗？
Do you have insurance?

884
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,691
在这种情况下你怎么还能做生意呢？
How can you do your business in this situation?

885
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,819
如果我再业绩很差，这个月我就出局了
If I perform poorly again, I'm out this month.

886
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,280
你应该买些，你有钱
You should buy some. You're rich.

887
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:43,084
你看到她今天的飞舞了吗？
Did you see her fly today?

888
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,957
她有铁拳！
She's got some iron fists!

889
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,915
复仇和公正
Revenge and justice.

890
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,632
有人需要帮助吗？
Anyone else need our help?

891
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,260
我们应该做这个生意
We should start a business in this.

892
01:17:56,547 --> 01:18:00,347
咱们做校服吧！
Let's make uniforms!

893
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,561
学校的校服真是相当舒服
This school uniform's actually quite comfy.

894
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,272
我们也印传单！
Let's make flyers, too!

895
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:08,776
最小的费用，最大的满足
Minimum fee, maximum satisfaction

896
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:12,196
-“阳光姐妹回来了！” -阳光姐妹！
- "Sunny is back!" - Sunny!

897
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:15,692
安静！
Be quiet!

898
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,919
-警官 -啥事？
- Officer. - What?

899
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,122
你能把声音调大点吗？
Can you turn up the volume?

900
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,499
嗯？好
Yeah? Right.

901
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:37,356
开打！
Attack!

902
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:47,204
娜美跳舞很屎，她能过得了庆典吗？
Na-mi sucks at dancing. Will she survive at the festival?

903
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,162
该死！来上我呀！
Dang! I really suck my ass!

904
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:53,039
那让这笨蛋滚蛋
Then get the fuck out.

905
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:56,088
没有笨蛋，我们会更好
We're better off without a clown.

906
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,209
嗨！
Hey!

907
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,257
那太刻薄了
That was bit mean.

908
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,220
春花，你爱她吗？
Chun-hwa, do you love her?

909
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:07,053
-你是女同吗？ -什么？
- Are you a lesbian? - What?

910
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,350
你和女的怎么干？
How do you do it with a woman?

911
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,413
阳光姐妹还是狗屎姐妹，我不再关心了
Sunny or shitty, I don't care any more.

912
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,751
我要离开这
I'm out of here.

913
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:53,807
你想干什么？
What do you want?

914
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,651
我不理解你为什么恨我？
I don't understand why you hate me.

915
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,522
但我不能让你那样离开我们
But I can't let you leave us like that.

916
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,615
-我们？ -对，我们！
- Us? - Yes, us!

917
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:06,366
你长胆了，什么时候我们这么亲了？
You've grown ballsy. When were we ever "us?"

918
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:10,870
我想知道你为什么恨我
I want to know why you hate me.

919
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:14,791
没理由，我就是恨你的一切
There's no reason. I just hate your everything.

920
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:16,004
失陪了
Get lost.

921
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,378
你那也不能去！
You're not going anywhere!

922
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,170
放开
Get off.

923
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,100
你是秀智的朋友吗？
Are you Su-ji's friend?

924
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,473
晚安
Good evening.

925
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,647
很高兴见到你，你吃饭了吗？
Nice meetin' ya. Have ya eaten yet?

926
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:34,765
滚开
Fuck off.

927
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:39,145
她从未带过朋友，来和我们吃点东西吧
She never brings a friend. Come eat somethin' with us.

928
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,146
我已经吃了
I ate somethin' already.

929
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,990
你也是来自全罗道的吗？
You from Jeolla-do too?

930
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,450
我说滚开
I said fuck off.

931
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:49,326
带她进来，妈妈要做些东西……
Bring her in, Mommy'll make something...

932
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,699
谁说你是我妈妈？你是继母！
Who says you're my mom? You're a stepmom!

933
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,097
晚安！
Good night!

934
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:21,354
你恨我是不公平的，就因为
It's not fair to hate me because

935
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,741
你的继母来自全罗道
your stelomom's from Jeolla-do.

936
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,782
那是违背……
That's against...

937
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,458
民主主义的，并且它鼓励了地区……
democracy and it encourages regional...

938
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,379
你甚至不能喝酒？
You can't even drink alcohol?

939
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:59,442
我活的也不容易，我哥哥是个民主分子
It's hard for me too. My brother's a democratic activist.

940
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,944
他应该坐牢去
He might go to jail.

941
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:06,153
我姥姥叫我“姐妹”
And my granny calls me "sis".

942
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,652
我要说的是“我们”是重要的
What I'm sayin' is that "us" is important.

943
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:14,749
你知道为什么“我们”是重要的？
You know why "us" is important?

944
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,584
但……我不喜欢你
Still... I don't like you.

945
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,755
但我仍旧喜欢你
But I still like you.

946
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,666
为什么？
Why?

947
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,426
因为你很漂亮
Cuz you're pretty.

948
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:33,806
坦白地讲，看到你我很震惊
Honestly, I was so shocked when I saw you.

949
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,184
在我过去的学校，我真的是最漂亮的
I was actually the prettiest in my old school.

950
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,934
但在首尔，所有的姑娘都漂亮
But in Seoul all the girls are pretty.

951
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:47,398
但你是最漂亮的
But you're the prettiest.

952
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:04,966
我喜欢你，你是世界上最漂亮的姑娘
I like you. You're the prettiest girl in the world!

953
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:18,684
对不起我这么漂亮，都是我的错
I'm sorry that I'm so pretty. It's all my fault.

954
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:23,230
你说什么呢？我才是该说对不起的人
What are you saying? I'm the one who's sorry.

955
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:28,648
我将不再这么漂亮，你现在很漂亮了
I'll stop being so pretty. You can be pretty now.

956
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:32,242
我也漂亮，对不起
I'm pretty, too. I'm sorry.

957
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:37,123
我会为你变成一个首尔姑娘
I'll become a Seoul girl for you.

958
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,710
等等，让我多喝点
Wait, let me drink more.

959
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,497
请再来杯烧酒！
One more soju please!

960
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,097
福姬成为韩国小姐了吗？
Did Bok-hee become a Miss Korea?

961
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,345
我们快点去吧
Let's go soon.

962
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,974
对，我想她
Yeah, I miss her.

963
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,690
不，我要去看春花，我有东西给她
No, I'm seeing Chun-hwa. I've something to give her.

964
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,185
我应该问一下她是否明天想来吗？
Should I ask if she wants to come tomorrow?

965
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,067
好的
Ok.

966
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,078
帮我……
Help me...

967
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:29,626
她母亲贷款来保住美发厅
Her mom took out loans to save her salon.

968
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:36,182
但她还不起钱，所以她开始在酒吧工作……
But she couldn't pay back, so she started working at bars...

969
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,511
……最后到的这
...and ended up here.

970
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:44,727
-她女儿怎样？ -她在救济院
- What about her daughter? - She's in a facility.

971
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,942
可怜的福姬……
Poor Bok-hee...

972
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,734
我们走吧
Let's just go.

973
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,287
我不能再看这个了
I can't see this any more.

974
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,743
朋友就是共患难的
Friends are for hard times.

975
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,172
福姬
Bok-hee.

976
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:42,448
对不起，我太喜欢咖啡了
Sorry. I like coffee too much.

977
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,627
我们去看春花吧，我们要马上离开吗？
Let's go see Chun-hwa. Shall we leave right now?

978
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:51,336
我可以先离开，我也是先离开学校的
I can leave early. I left school early, too.

979
01:26:56,795 --> 01:27:02,802
如果你没带男的来，你就没有自由时间
If you don't bring a guy, you don't get a free time.

980
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,514
如果你没其他的事做，去打扫厕所！
If you have nothing else to do, go clean the toilet!

981
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,151
对不起，她平时挺好的
Sorry. She's usually nice.

982
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,438
我马上回来，喝你们的咖啡吧
I'll be back soon. Drink your coffee.

983
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,691
对不起，夫人
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

984
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:22,534
-对不起 -闭嘴！
- I'm sorry. - Shut up!

985
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,822
嗨！
Hey!

986
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,505
给我这最贵的酒
Give me the most expensive bottle here.

987
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,247
能再说一遍吗？
Pardon me?

988
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:36,627
最贵的、标价最高的
The most expensive and overpriced one.

989
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,008
再把最贵的食物拿这来
Also bring the most expensive food here.

990
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,679
我会为她付费的，今天你服务
And I'll pay for her fee. You serve today.

991
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,315
一百万韩元够了吗？想要更多也成
Is one million won enough? I'll pay more if you want.

992
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:53,853
给
Here.

993
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,407
坐这里
Sit here.

994
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:02,118
你是我的英雄，娜美！
You're my hero, Na-mi!

995
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:07,704
拿真的酒来，不是假货！
Bring real liquor, not the fake one!

996
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:08,871
好的
Alright.

997
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,881
福姬，我们给你找其他的工作
Bok-hee, let's find you another job.

998
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,881
为什么？我不需要，你想要傻逼吗？
Why? I don't need to. Do you want beef jerky?

999
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:22,507
我会帮你找其他的工作
I'll help you find other job.

1000
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,509
但我什么也不会
But I don't have any skills.

1001
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:30,932
我能做点美发工作，记得我妈妈的美发厅吗？
I can do some hairdreesing. Remember my mom's hair salon?

1002
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:34,984
我给过你们所有人双眼皮贴，对吗？
I gave you all the double eyelid tapes, right?

1003
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,862
对，让我们做些那样的事吧
Yes, let's do something like that.

1004
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,234
你有个女儿，你必须和她一起生活
You have a daughter. You have to live with her.

1005
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:04,423
我想和宝美一起生活
I want to live with Bo-mi.

1006
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:09,470
没有我，她甚至不能……
Without me, she can't even...

1007
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,106
……打开热水器 -福姬
...turn on the heater... - Bok-hee.

1008
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:16,728
我们会帮你的
We'll help you.

1009
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:20,106
你们怎么帮我？
How can you help me?

1010
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,567
为什么春花要死？
And why is Chun-hwa dying?

1011
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,446
难道她不想照顾我们大家了吗？嗯？
Isn't she supposed to take care of us all? Huh?

1012
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:50,601
娜美
Na-mi.

1013
01:29:53,638 --> 01:30:00,817
为什么你……只是看着？
Why are you... just looking?

1014
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,653
你没在睡觉吗？
You weren't sleeping?

1015
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:07,323
过来
Come here.

1016
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,964
-春花 -怎么了？
- Chun-hwa. - What?

1017
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,709
谢谢你
Thank you.

1018
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,589
为什么？
For What?

1019
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:31,594
长时间以来，我是作为一个妻子和某个人的母亲生活……
For a long time, I lived as a wife and a mother of someone...

1020
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:39,648
都忘了我过去是什么样的了
and forgot how I was my own being.

1021
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:47,697
现在我意识到我是自己生活的主宰
Now I realize that I'm the protagonist of my life.

1022
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:55,705
你有一张主宰者的脸
You have a face of a protagonist.

1023
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:06,678
秀智也有一张主宰者的脸……
Su-ji also had a face of a protagonist...

1024
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:11,888
我们会为你找到她
I'll find her for you.

1025
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,737
这是什么？
What's this?

1026
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,919
阳光姐妹
SUNNY

1027
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:52,053
丈夫
HUSBAND

1028
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:56,891
娜美！拿住了它
Na-mi! Hold it straight.

1029
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,643
春花
Chun-hwa

1030
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:04,148
在男人的世界里，你干得很棒
you've done a great job in a man 's world.

1031
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,939
我不能相信，你仍旧照顾这些家伙！
I can't believe you're still taking care of these guys!

1032
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,983
我认为你是最棒的
I think you're the best.

1033
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:15,789
江美，我认为你会是最棒的整形病人
Jang-mi, I think you'll be the best plastic surgery patient.

1034
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,953
做了双眼皮后，你变得如此美丽
You'll turn so beautiful after the double eyelid surgery.

1035
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:23,964
珍熙！我知道你会编一部脏话字典，并且
Jin - hee! I know you'll make a swearword dictionary and

1036
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,337
和某个男子坠入爱河……操！
with a man you fall in love... Fuck!

1037
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,256
你要和男人做什么……？
You're gonna do what with a man...?

1038
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:32,468
我想当笨蛋！
I wanna do it foo!

1039
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:40,140
你好，金玉！我知道你会变成著名的作家
Hello Geum-ok! I know you'll become a very famous writer.

我也读过你的书，非常棒……
I also read your book and it was awesome...

1041
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:54,861
福姬！

1042
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:59,958
嗨，福姬，我相信你现在是韩国小姐了
Hi, Bok-hee. I believe you're a Miss Korea by now.

1043

你好，未来的娜美

我是高中的娜美

我认为你现在是艺术家了
I think you'd be an artist by now.

1054
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:09,149
你一上大学就成了DJ

1055
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:13,277
我也想成为漫画书店老板
And I also want to become an owner of a comic bookstore.

我将会出演初吻这样的电影

并且我也想成为舞蹈家……

你甚至不会跳舞！
You can't even dance!

1062
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,425
春花，过来！
Chun-hwa, come here!

1063
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,080
你要去哪？

没钱！

1067
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,558
嗨，村姑！
Hey, farm girl!

1068
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:33,775
你喝水像个真的村姑一样

1069
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,105
你想要干什么？

1070
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:38,324
我有话要问
I have something to ask.

1071

我听说在农村……

1072
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,827
……人们在草垛后群交

1073
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,741
-你干过吗？ -李相美！

哇，吓死我了
Wow, I'm impressed.

1076
01:35:56,334 --> 01:36:03,309
别期望春花和她的姐妹一直黏在一起
Don't expect Chun-hwa and her pals to stick around forever.

1077
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:07,520
-她们会踹掉你，只要…… -别他妈的和我瞎扯！
- They'll dump you as soon as... - Stop fucking with me!

1078
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,154
这次我让你走
I'm letting you go this once.

1079
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,572
小心点！
Be careful!

1080
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:43,506
在垃圾堆见
MEET ME AT THE GARBAGE DUMP.

1081
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,014
嗨，村姑！
Hey, farm girl!

1082
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,906
你没说我必须独自前来
You didn't say I have to come alone.

1083
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:05,403
说对不起
Say sorry.

1084
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,279
什么？
What?

1085
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:10,242
如果你说对不起，我会原谅这一切
If you say sorry, I'll forgive everything.

1086
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,706
我不说
I won't.

1087
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:16,210
那么我先说，我对不起说脏话了
I'll say it first, then. I'm sorry I used swearwords.

1088
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:20,377
我听说你和春花是朋友，但你们打过架
I heard you were friends with Chun-hwa but you had a fight

1089
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,253
因为春花不喜欢你臭烘烘的……
because Chun-hwa didn't like you sniffing glue...

1090
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,010
我再也不能听这些屁话了
I can't listen to this bullshit any more.

1091
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:33,102
你们这些家伙叫自己什么？阳光姐妹？
You guys call yourself what? Sunny?

1092
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:36,601
你们没有意识到这是你们的末日
You guys don't realize this is the end of yours.

1093
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:40,113
我要把你们都杀了，一个接一个……
I'm going to kill all of you, one by one...

1094
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,774
……就从今天开始
...starting from today.

1095
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:47,737
给我相机
Give me the camera.

1096
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:49,827
把衣服脱了
Take them off.

1097
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,586
真妈的乱呀！
What a fucking mess.

1098
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:33,075
再说一遍，你想做什么？
Say that again. You're gonna do what?

1099
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,285
妈的婊子！
Fucking bitch!

1100
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,333
你想要你那美丽的脸毁掉吗？
Do you want your pretty face to get ruined?

1101
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:39,747
我会抓花你的……
I'll scratch your...

1102
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:55,397
你得带她去医院了
You'll have to take her to the hospital.

1103
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:02,020
别那么干，秀智！
Don't do it, Su-ji!

1104
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:04,322
别那么干！
Don't do it!

1105
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:14,700
如果我是你
If I were you

1106
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:17,372
我会感到太羞耻而不去学校
I'd be too shamed to come to school.

1107
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,722
我们打算和哥哥的朋友出去旅行
We're going on a travel with my bro's friends.

1108
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:37,439
两天，你应该加入
Two days. You should join.

1109
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,766
俊浩也要过来！
Jun-ho is coming too!

1110
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:45,730
发生什么事了？
What happened?

1111
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:48,904
天哪，有什么不对吗？
Gosh, what's wrong?

1112
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:49,984
你打架了？
Did you fight?

1113
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:52,741
-我摔跤了 -你没有
- I fell down. - You did not!

1114
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:53,738
相当严重
It's quite serious.

1115
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,586
谁他妈的在学校抽烟？
Who the fuck smokes in school?

1116
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:03,710
美国香烟？
And American cigarette?

1117
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:09,137
我难道没告诉你们，如果我发现你们抽烟，我会撕了你们吗？
Didn't I tell you I'll rip you off if I find you smoking?

1118
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:18,264
把你们包里和口袋里的所有东西放到桌子上
Put everything in your bag and pocket on the desk.

1119
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:19,472
现在！
Now!

1120
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:34,738
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

1121
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:37,657
站起来
Get up.

1122
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:39,496
站起来
Get up.

1123
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:45,541
站起来，站起来！
Get up. Get up!

1124
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:50,803
你不站起来？嗯？站起来！
You're not getting up? Huh? Get up!

1125
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,468
妈的站起来！
Get the fuck up!

1126
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:59,312
好，你死定了
Ok. You're a dead meat.

1127
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:03,437
你让我真生气了
You're making me real angry.

1128
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:06,645
我让你见识一下海军陆战队员怎么打你这样的婊子的
I'll show you how a Marine beats bitches like you.

1129
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:10,987
回军队去，干你自己吧，妈个逼的！
Go back to the army and fuck yourself, motherfucker!

1130
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,683
我们仍旧找不到郑秀智
We still can't find JUNG Su-ji.

1131
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:48,688
这不是最好的解决方法，但我们会发讣告
This isn't the best solution, but we could publish an obituary.

1132
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:52,523
但当然，我们会再次尝试的
But of course, we'll try again.

1133
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,865
你要我单独找的那个人……
And the person you asked me to find separately...

1134
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,208
韩俊浩
HAN JUN-HO

1135
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,737
没我别打她！
Don't hit her without me!

1136
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,737
有事吗？
Wassup?

1137
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,910
没事
Nothing.

1138
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,745
来和我们玩吧
Come and play with us.

1139
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,461
请进！
Come on in!

1140
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:39,175
-请来咖啡 -好的
- Coffee, please. - Sure.

1141
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,686
爸爸！你晚了
Dad! You're late.

1142
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:30,230
你很长时间没来这了
You haven't been here for a long time.

1143
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:36,608
没有吗？
No?

1144
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:41,108
有一段时间了
It's been a while.

1145
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,126
我终于把这个给你了
I can finally give this to you.

1146
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:55,683
真德校庆
JINDEOK SCHOOL FESTIVAL

1147
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,439
我爱秀智
I LOVE SU-JI

1148
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,357
秀智是我的生命
SU-JI IS MY LIFE

1149
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,484
媒体的力量呀！
The power of mass media!

1150
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:10,409
在秀智上了杂志后，她的粉丝翻了三番！
After Su-ji got on the magazine, her fans have tripled!

1151
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,578
她要是变成了真的电影明星怎么办？
What if she becomes a real movie star?

1152
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,827
没啥大不了的
Not a big deal.

1153
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:20,836
要是你变成了电影明星，我们把双眼皮手术也一起做了！
If you become a movie star, let's do the eyelid surgery together!

1154
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,796
我会为你做的！
I was gonna do that for you!

1155
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:29,924
你为什么行为怪怪的？
Why are you acting weird?

1156
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:31,926
没事
Nothing.

1157
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:36,056
去弄点东西吃吧，我们时间充足
Go get something to eat. We have enough time.

1158
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:00,743
娜美！

1159
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,215
我太想你了
I thought of you a lot.

1160
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:16,929
对不起
I'm sorry.

1161
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:25,481
我应该对新人更好点
I should have been nicer to a new kid.

1162
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,188
原谅我
Forgive me.

1163
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,609
不，我对不起
No, I'm sorry.

1164
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:33,734
真的？
Really?

1165
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:38,782
那么我们一起吃饭来庆祝我们的友谊
Then let's eat together to celebrate our friendship.

1166
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,331
你闻起来臭烘烘的
You smell like glue.

1167
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:48,624
我闻起来？
I smell?

1168
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:50,505
我闻起来吗？！
Do I smell?!

1169
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:51,673
不是
No.

1170
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:55,844
-你闻起来臭烘烘的…… -妈的别闹了！
- You smell like glue... - For fuck's sake!

1171
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:02,263
当然我闻起来！
Of course I smell!

1172
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:10,108
你喝的是“阳光十号”，所以你闻起来像阳光
You drink "Sunny 10", so you smell like Sunny.

1173
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:20,330
你想要些吗？
You want some?

1174
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,121
你应该试试，来吧
You should try it. Come on.

1175
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:28,877
来吧
Come on.

1176
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,052
继续，喝
Go on, drink.

1177
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:36,471
继续！
Go on!

1178
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:48,067
下面使我们自豪的太鼓象皮乐队
Next is our proud drum and fife band,

1179
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:51,737
她们在非洲成功巡演后回来
who came back from the successful Africa tour!

1180
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:03,328
哦，性感
Ooh, sexy

1181
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,001
春花
Chun-hwa.

1182
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:20,636
我给你买这个
I'm buying you this.

1183
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:23,264
你应该喝点东西
You gotta drink something.

1184
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,636
好的
That's ok.

1185
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,768
为什么？你认为我脏吗？
Why? You think I'm dirty?

1186
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:30,439
为我们的友谊干杯！
Drink it for our friendship!

1187
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:41,867
从现在起我就是阳光姐妹了，阳光的味道，阳光……
I'm Sunny from now on. Sunny smell, Sunny...

1188
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:49,037
我告诉你如果你是来恶心人的，我会杀了你的！
I told you I'll kill you if you come sniffin' glue!

1189
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:53,832
拉她起来
Get her up.

1190
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:23,161
为什么我不被允许？
Why am I not allowed?

1191
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:27,665
她有什么特殊的？
What's so special about her?

1192
01:52:33,538 --> 01:52:35,211
嗨，漂亮脸蛋

1193
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,207
- 秀智！ - 秀智！

1194
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:44,326
从这出去！
Get out of here!

1195
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,717
秀智……
Su-ji...

1196
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,136
你们都被退学了
You're all expelled.

1197
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:10,432
在领导面前干的不错呀！
Fantastic job in front of the inspector!

1198
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:13,931
另一个在哪？嗨，你！

来这，小狗屎！

来这！
Come here!

1201
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:28,204
过去的学校就是这么教你的吗？
Is that how you were taught in your old school?

1202
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:36,128
我变卖一切搬到这里，为了你的教育！
I sold everything to move here. For your education!

1203
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:38,417
别打她！
Don't hit her!

1204
01:54:38,413 --> 01:54:43,044
一个去坐牢，另一个被停学
One goes of jail, the other gets suspended!

1205
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:47,048
滚出我的房子，你们都滚！
Get the fuck out of my house. All of you!

1206
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:50,384
你为什么……
Why did you hang out...

1207
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:54,139
-……和坏女孩混在一起？ -请别打她，爸爸
...with bad girls? - Please don't hit her, papa.

1208
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:55,472
父亲
Father.

1209
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:05,028
我出卖了我的战友来保全自己
I sold out my comrades to save my skin.

1210
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:08,201
我是该死的狗
I'm a goddamn dog.

1211
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,283
从现在起我将像狗一样生活
I'll live like a dog from now.

1212
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:18,379
哦，我的宝贝，我的儿子！
Oh, my baby. My son!

1213
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:20,539
我的孩子！
My boy!

1214
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:06,338
她怎么样了？
How is she?

1215
01:56:08,128 --> 01:56:09,880
她试图自杀
She tried to kill herself.

1216
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:22,684
没事，她没死
It's ok. She's not dead.

1217
01:56:24,102 --> 01:56:24,898
没事
It's ok.

1218
01:56:24,895 --> 01:56:27,990
我们不打算彼此再见了吗？
We're not going to see each other again?

1219
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:30,571
任娜美！
IM Na-mi!

1220
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:36,786
被赶出学校不是阳光姐妹的结束
Getting expelled from school isn't the end of Sunny.

1221
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:43,459
我们会再见的，带秀智和我们一起
We'll meet again, bring Su-ji with us

1222
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,750
跳我们今天不能跳的舞
and dance what we couldn't dance today.

1223
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:49,635
明白吗？
Understand?

1224
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:53,632
你们明白吗？
Do you understand?

1225
01:56:57,802 --> 01:57:00,976
我们会再见的
We'll meet again.

1226
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:05,398
如果你因为你的生活太好而忽略我们
If you ignore us because your life is too good,

1227
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:07,195
我们会去惩罚你的
we'll go and punish you.

1228
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:10,273
如果你因为生活不如意而躲着
If you hide because your life sucks,

1229
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:13,360
我们会去让它变好点
we'll go and make it better.

1230
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:18,332
我不知道我们中谁会先死
I don't know who will die first among us,

1231
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:21,785
但直到那一天……
but until that day...

1232
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:27,629
不，甚至是过了那一天……我们，阳光姐妹，绝不会分开
No, even beyond that day... We, Sunny, will never break up.

1233
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:20,723
-你为什么来？ -我想你
- Why did you come? - I missed you.

1234
01:58:22,846 --> 01:58:24,098
一切还好吗？
Everything okay?

1235
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,352
是的，一切还好
Yeah, everything's ok.

1236
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:38,320
市中心通常是最好的路线……
Downtown is usually the best route...

1237
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:41,327
-冯先生？ -是？
- Mr. Bong? - Yes?

1238
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:44,747
市中心从来就不是最好的路线
Downtown is never the best route.

1239
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:47,412
好的……
Ok...

1240
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:51,332
咋啦？
What?

1241
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:54,502
什么？
What?

1242
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:27,243
妈妈！
Mom!

1243
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:29,079
你的电话
Your phone.

1244
01:59:34,459 --> 01:59:36,006
江美？
Jang-mi?

1245
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:04,823
这就是独身死去的问题，没有家庭
This is the problem of dying single. No family.

1246
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:08,122
那就是为什么你不会离婚吗？
Is that why you won't get a divorce?

1247
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:12,672
他给了我一栋楼
He gave me a building.

1248
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,087
而且他说他再也不会了
Also he said he won't again.

1249
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:17,881
你现在也有婚外情了吗？
Did you have an affair too?

1250
02:00:19,796 --> 02:00:20,797
你有吗？
You did?

1251
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:22,803
你有！
You did!

1252
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:25,802
你说过我们应该一起干的！
You said we should do it together!

1253
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:28,145
谁说我有？
Who said I did?

1254
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:32,105
你说过你会考虑一下的，你个优柔寡断的婊子
And you said you'd think about it, you indecisive bitch.

1255
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:35,479
葬礼的时候别骂人
Stop swearing in the funeral.

1256
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:37,818
疯婊子
Crazy bitches.

1257
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,156
娜美
Na-mi.

1258
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:46,327
金玉？
Geum-ok?

1259
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:49,417
你怎么做到的？
How did you make it?

1260
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:52,454
我不再在乎了
I don't care any more.

1261
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:54,414
你真棒，姑娘！
You go girl!

1262
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,252
金玉，医生的女儿！
Geum-ok the dentist's girl!

1263
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:00,174
好久不见！
Long time no see!

1264
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:02,844
-你过的怎么样？ -很好
- How have you been? - Good.

1265
02:01:02,839 --> 02:01:04,386
你一点没变
You haven't changed a bit.

1266
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:05,634
-是吗？ -对
- Really? - Yeah.

1267
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,177
见到你真高兴！
It's so nice to see you!

1268
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,729
等一下，我想和春花打个招呼
Wait a sec, I want to say hi to Chun-hwa.

1269
02:01:09,721 --> 02:01:13,021
你可以等等，大家都到齐了我们再一起去
You can wait. We'll do it together when everybody comes.

1270
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:17,570
还有谁要来？秀智吗？她还好吗？
Who else is coming? Su-ji? Is she ok?

1271
02:01:17,854 --> 02:01:20,277
福姬怎么样？她变成韩国小姐了吗？
What about Bok-hee? Did she become a Miss Korea?

1272
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:22,654
奖金太少了
The prize money was too small.

1273
02:01:24,486 --> 02:01:26,830
很高兴见到你们！
It's good to see you guys!

1274
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:36,335
为什么没人来这？
How come nobody's here?

1275
02:01:36,331 --> 02:01:38,049
真正的葬礼是昨天
The actual funeral was yesterday.

1276
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,260
今天她只想见我们
Today she just wanted us.

1277
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:43,596
春花总是特殊，让我们等秀智一起吧
Chun-hwa's always special. Let's wait for Su-ji together.

1278
02:01:43,588 --> 02:01:46,216
秀智要来吗？她的脸还好吗？
Su-ji is coming? Is her face ok?

1279
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:51,063
我们没有真正找到她，但我们打了广告了
We didn't actually find her, but we did put an ad.

1280
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:53,022
秀智，请参加春花的最后演唱会！
SU-JI, PLEASE ATTEND CHUN-HWA'S LAST CONCERT!

1281
02:01:53,014 --> 02:01:54,607
我们坐下里聊聊吧
Let's sit down and talk.

1282
02:01:54,849 --> 02:01:57,898
我们等到十二点吧，大家觉着成吗？
Let's wait till 12. Everybody ok with that?

1283
02:01:57,894 --> 02:01:58,986
金玉？
Geum-ok?

1284
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:03,735
我没问题，今晚不回那去了
I'm fine. Not going back there tonight.

1285
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:06,445
福姬，你怎么样？
Bok-hee, what do you do?

1286
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:12,201
那个什么……我正在找新工作
This and that... I'm looking for a new job.

1287
02:02:12,617 --> 02:02:16,042
你很幸运，每个女人都应有个工作
You're so lucky. Every women should have a job.

1288
02:02:16,037 --> 02:02:18,586
我厌倦被我丈夫和他家人忽略了
I'm tired of being ignored by my husband and his family.

1289
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:21,334
我认为有个丈夫不是坏事
I don't think it's a bad thing to have a husband.

1290
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:24,341
-什么？他们欺负你？ -嗯
- What? Do they bully you? - Uh-huh.

1291
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:26,055
-我们应该惩罚他们吗？ -对！
- Should we punish them? - Yeah!

1292
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,886
难道我没告诉你，我们打了欺负娜美女儿的人吗？
Didn't I tell you about when we beat up Na-mi's daughter's bully?

1293
02:02:29,884 --> 02:02:32,433
-没，从没有！ -告诉我，告诉我！
- No, never! - Tell me, tell me!

1294
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:35,724
有点复杂……
It's a bit complicated...

1295
02:02:37,475 --> 02:02:39,443
我猜秀智不会来了
I guess Su-ji can't make it.

1296
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:42,693
-我们现在应该行礼了吗？ -好的
- Should we greet now? - Alright.

1297
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,907
你是来参加夏春花的葬礼的吗？
Did you come for HA Chun-hwa's funeral?

1298
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:55,368
我是夏女士的律师
I'm the lawyer of Mrs. HA.

1299
02:02:56,911 --> 02:02:58,663
你是“阳光姐妹”的成员吗？
Are you the members of "Sunny?"

1300
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:07,840
我来这是执行夏女士的遗嘱的
I'm here to execute the will of Mrs. HA.

1301
02:03:08,965 --> 02:03:13,641
她特别嘱咐我要生动地读出来
She especially ordered me to read it realistically.

1302
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:18,980
所以请忍着点我
So please bear with me.

1303
02:03:20,518 --> 02:03:21,815
嗨，婊子们！
Hey bitches!

1304
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,403
我只是读得像……
I just read it like...

1305
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,491
对不起，我接着读
Sorry, I'll read it again.

1306
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:33,907
嗨，婊……婊……我略过这些
Hey b... b... I'll skip that.

1307
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:36,872
大家都在着吗？
Is everyone here?

1308
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:40,584
如果你没来，我理解
If you didn't make it, I understand.

1309
02:03:41,205 --> 02:03:45,631
对不起，我们未能履行我们的誓言
I'm sorry we didn't keep the promise we made

1310
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:48,804
二十五年前在秀智的房前所发的誓言
in front of Su-ji's house 25 years ago.

1311
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:54,477
我知道死的这么早，我是个坏领队
I know I'm a bad leader for dying so early.

1312
02:03:56,012 --> 02:04:00,142
娜美，谢谢找到我们的朋友
Na-mi, thanks for finding our friends.

1313
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:03,190
我的生命不长，但是……
My life wasn't long, but...

1314
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:09,235
如你所说，我是自己生命的主宰
as you've said, I was the protagonist of my life.

1315
02:04:09,984 --> 02:04:12,533
为此谢谢你
Thank you for that.

1316
02:04:13,404 --> 02:04:17,830
娜美将是阳光姐妹的下一个领队
Na-mi will be the next leader of Sunny.

1317
02:04:18,701 --> 02:04:24,424
请为我享受生命

1318

夏女士留了礼物给你们大家

1323

你是一个保险代理吗？

1326
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:57,282
对
Yes.

1327
02:04:57,657 --> 02:05:05,257
这的每个人都要买你卖的每份保险

1328
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:11,593
所有的费用将全额支付

我真为你高兴！

1330
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,267
怎么……？
How...?

1331
02:05:16,968 --> 02:05:20,222
她留下了大量的钱
She left a large sum of money behind.

1332
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:26,187
她把剩余的捐给慈善组织，另外……
She donated the rest to charity and...

1333
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:36,363
你是本月的保险皇后了，婊子！
You're the insurance queen of the month, bitch!

1334
02:05:37,447 --> 02:05:42,044
我以前还从未当过皇后！

02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:48,629
你可以是副领队
You can be the vice-leader.

1338
02:05:49,459 --> 02:05:50,802
就这样
That's it.

1339
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,514
但我过去总是副领队
But I was always the vice-leader.

1340
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,304
别说瞎话了，副领队是我
Don't lie. The vice-leader was me.

1341
02:05:57,633 --> 02:05:59,852
你在说什么呀？
What are you talking about?

1342
02:05:59,927 --> 02:06:02,476
秀智和我过去一直是副领队
Su-ji and I were always the vice-leader.

1343
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:03,689
你失望吗？
Are you disappointed?

1344
02:06:05,433 --> 02:06:07,106
不完全如此……
Not exactly...

1345
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:10,689
她告诉我如果你失望，就读这里
She told me to read here if you're disappointed.

1346
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:13,149
我没有

1347
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:16,110
说什么？
What does it say?

1348
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:18,112
婊子！你有钱了！
Bitch! You're rich!

1349
02:06:20,323 --> 02:06:21,791
你有钱了！

-对你太好了！ -祝贺你！

1363
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,831
