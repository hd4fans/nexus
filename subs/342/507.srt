1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,080
I came as soon as I got the call. What's going on?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,890
Sorry to pull you in this late. We just tracked down our perp.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,010
Lieutenant, this is the doctor I mentioned.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,780
Yes. Forensic psychologist? That's right.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,960
Nice to meet you. Where's Crane?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,090
He's already interrogating the suspect.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,040
What do you mean, Crane's interrogating the suspect?

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,830
We know you saw more than you admitted.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,140
Tell us. We mean you no harm.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,930
The suspect is obviously teeing up an insanity defense.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,060
She's smart.

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,520
She knows exactly what she's doing. She?

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,210
Why is that?

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,240
Why are you deceiving us?

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,050
What did you see?

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,520
Abbie!

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,150
What is going on here?

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,750
We finally caught Abigail Mills. Mostly thanks to the good doctor here.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,660
Caught? I don't understand. She didn't do anything wrong.

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,620
Did she? I think you know the answer to that.

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,700
Stop lying, Abbie.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,900
The truth will set you free.

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,850
Captain!

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,640
The door's locked!

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,770
Sir!

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,630
Let me out of here! Someone let me out of here!

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,560
Let me out! Let me out!

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,390
Let me out!

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,480
Let me out of here!

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,090
This is Mills. Dispatch here.

31
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,870
Emergency response has requested you at 3rd and Main.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,070
On my way.

33
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,660
What kind of dream? A really weird one.

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,070
You were in it.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,340
And what, pray tell, was I doing in your dream?

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,870
Freaking me out even more than usual. Mills.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,850
What's going on, Captain?

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,340
Do you know a Dr. Mara Vega? No. Should I?

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,010
We have our crisis responders up there now trying to talk her down,

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,600
but she doesn't want to speak to anyone except, apparently, you.

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,670
Why the lieutenant?

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,120
That's what I need her to find out.

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,370
Dr. Vega?

44
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,270
Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

45
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,910
You wanted to speak to me?

46
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,500
It was my fault.

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,130
Everything she saw was real.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,570
I believed her and I lied.

49
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,990
Should have told the truth.

50
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,790
About what? Who are you talking about, Doc?

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,570
Your sister Jenny.

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,560
It's my fault, Abbie.

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,760
I deserve it.

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,010
I've had this coming a long time.

55
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,720
We all have.

56
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,590
Wait... Don't!

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340

60
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,280
Are you all right?

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, I'm okay. What happened?

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm not sure. It was bizarre. It was really bizarre.

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,280
Dr. Vega... It was like she was sleepwalking, her mind was elsewhere,

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,520
and her eyes... they were glazed over white.

65
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,660
Glazed white?

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,560
Maybe she was prescribing herself some sort of recreational drug.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Didn't look like that or anything else I've ever seen before.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,460
All the color was gone.

69
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,410
Uh, medic, I'd like to see the body before you remove it.

70
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,920
I'd like to take a look at her eyes. Yeah, sure.

71
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,680
It presents as a massive cataract.

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,640
No sign of trauma, no petechiae.

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
No one sees or goes near this body until I say.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
You understand?

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,830
What the hell is going on here?

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,060
A complete stranger summons Lieutenant Mills to her side before sleepwalking to her death.

77
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,880
This after her eyes somehow transmogrified into sand-filled orbs of the purest white.

78
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,550
- What else is going on, Lieutenant? - She mentioned my sister, Jenny.

79
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,110
She must have known her, maybe that's how she knew who I was.

80
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,290
Hang on a sec.

81
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,310
Did your sister spend any time at Tarrytown Psychiatric?

82
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,570
First year she was committed, yeah.

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,320
- Been in and out of there for years. - Dr. Vega's one of the resident psychs.

84
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,860
I'll get you all of her files. See what you can dig up.

85
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,130
In the meantime, let's keep a lid on this.

86
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,790
The last thing we need around here is another episode of The Twilight Zone.

87
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,600
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,270
Care to share any additional information you withheld from the captain?

89
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,200
You know the nightmare I had? You were in it,

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,100
so was the requisite faceless nightmare monster, but...

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,880
Vega was there, too.

92
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,940
Except that is impossible because I have never met her before.

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,820
I think our definition of possible has been irrevocably broadened.

94
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,520
You had a prophetic dream warning you of an impending event.

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,060
Which stands to reason, given that, according to Washington's Bible...

96
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,690
The Book of Revelation foretells of two witnesses, I know.

97
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,340
I am a cop in a small town.

98
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,540
So let's not curse me as a capital "W" witness just yet.

99
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,790
Consider what you just saw. This isn't simply a suicide.

100
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,590
This pertains to the seven years of tribulations.

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,740
The creature in your nightmare... I barely saw it.

102
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,630
Perhaps it is the true cause of the doctor's death.

103
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,430
A soldier in the army of evil sent against us.

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,480
Against you, the capital "W" witness.

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,910
Maybe. But unless you have an encyclopedia of faceless nightmare monsters,

106
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,850
why don't we just start with a little regular

107
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,780
(police line)
detective work here?

108
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,200
One more time. From the beginning, Jenny.

109
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,630
I saw a demon.

110
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,790
I heard a voice say, "Come and see. "

111
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,900
Then... I wasn't in the forest anymore.

112
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,260
Where do you think you were?

113
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,560
Listen to this... Vega's private notes.

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,390
"Jenny exhibits no other signs of delusion. "

115
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
What did you do?

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,210
Sorry. Continue.

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,320
"The better I get to know her, the more I believe she's telling the truth. "

118
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,500
There are at least three other similar mentions.

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,190
Vega knew that Jenny wasn't crazy.

120
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,600
Yet she allowed her to remain institutionalized, presumably from fear of censure.

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,580
Believe me, fear is a pretty powerful motivator.

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,270
Fear causes inaction. Inaction causes pain.

123
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,580
QED, fear causes pain.

124
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,070
I'll grant it's a syllogism, but you get my meaning.

125
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,790
Vega feels responsible for keeping Jenny committed.

126
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,500
The guilt eats her up inside until she can't take it anymore.

127
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,200
She seeks me out for some kind of absolution, then jumps. QED, case closed.

128
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,430
You're forgetting about the doctor's white eyes.

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,780
About the sand that poured from them and your prophetic dream about Dr. Vega.

130
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,290
And Vega's last words.

131
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,970
Before she jumped, she said that she had it coming.

132
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,040
"We" have it coming.

133
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,700
And you question that this death has to do with your role as a witness?

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,310
Fine. Let's say that this is some evil minion

135
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,000
sent after us by the demon in the woods. What does it want?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,280
Why hurt Dr. Vega, and what do I have to do with any of it?

137
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,080
My best guess is the enemy wants what all enemies want.

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,700
To thwart his opponent.

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,700
Clearly you're a threat to him as is your sister.

140
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,560
- We must speak to her at once. - No, it's not happening.

141
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,760
I understand you've not spoken to your sister in some time, but...

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,890
We don't talk, period.

143
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,810
What time doesn't change, death will, don't you suppose?

144
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,160
Now, I'd rather keep the latter at bay.

145
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,780
Okay.

146
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,870
You want to see her? Let's go.

147
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,910
See for yourself.

148
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,330
This is pointless. All of our personal issues aside,

149
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,850
she's not gonna help me because I'm a cop and she's a criminal.

150
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,080
- Oh, she's a criminal now? - Do you know why she's locked up in here?

151
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
She broke into a sporting goods store and stole a bunch of survival gear, 

152
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,720
over 4,000 bucks' worth of stuff.

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,240
Does your current law enforcement incarcerate all thieves in sanatoriums?

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,240
She told the cops that she needed it because she was preparing for the End of Days.

155
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,450
Oh, well, she's perfectly sane, then.

156
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,300
Lieutenant Abbie Mills to see Jennifer Mills.

157
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,960
- I'm her sister. - I didn't know Jenny had a sister.

158
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,770
She does.

159
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,000
One second.

160
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,290
Extension 49, please.

161
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,140
Don't be afraid of number 49, Abbie.

162
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,130
When was the last time you saw your sister?

163
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm sorry. Saw or talked to?

164
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,650
Last time I saw her was back row of a county courthouse

165
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,650
five years ago when she was arrested for breaking and entering the first time.

166
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,020
I tried to offer to help. It's complicated.

167
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm sorry, Miss Mills, but Jenny doesn't want to talk to you.

168
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,950
Thank you.

169
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,760
You're an officer of the law.

170
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,750
Is she not obligated to speak to you?

171
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,250
I could force the issue and make Jenny talk to me, but that isn't gonna get us what we need.

172
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,350
Would you be amenable to my speaking with her?

173
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,780
If she's amenable. Sure, knock yourself out.

174
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,850
Would you, again, please?

175
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,450
Thank you for seeing me, Miss Mills.

176
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,440
Curiosity got the best of me.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,920
Who are you? Abbie's new boyfriend?

178
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,250
We are amicable, and yes, I am male,

179
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,490
but I suspect you're implying something else.

180
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,760
What's your name, tall, dark and British?

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
My name is Ichabod Crane.

182
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,280
What do your friends call you?

183
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,990
"Icky"?

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Not if they wish to remain my friends.

185
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,160
Sense of humor, too.

186
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,790
I've seen the demon in the woods.

187
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,140
The one you and your sister saw as children.

188
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,020
They lock you up in here when you talk crazy.

189
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,470
That's why I'm in here and she's out there.

190
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,370
She didn't tell you, did she?

191
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,620
Ask her.

192
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,640
Make her tell you all the dirty details.

193
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,670
I wonder what you'll think of her once you know.

194
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm afraid I have some regrettable news.

195
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,040
Your former doctor, Dr. Vega,

196
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,190
tragically leapt to her death last night.

197
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm very sorry.

198
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Your sister was the last person she spoke to.

199
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,740
The doctor said, "We've all got it coming. "

200
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,070
What did she mean? I don't know.

201
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,020
You do know there are things in Sleepy Hollow that are not of this realm.

202
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,800
What do you think could have killed the doctor?

203
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,670
It's time to go. The Four Horsemen are coming.

204
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,000
You're a liar. The first is already here.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
He beheaded Sheriff Corbin and Reverend Knapp before he fled from us.

206
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,550
You're not menteinsana, Miss Mills.

207
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,360
I don't believe you are. Neither does your sister.

208
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,820
If you mean what you say...

209
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,310
then you know there's not much I can do for you.

210
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,930
You already know what I do.

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,540
Help us fight the Horsemen's army. Help you?

212
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,020
It's all over but the crying.

213
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,990
My conscience is clear.

214
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,890
Ask Abbie if she can say the same.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,410
Lieutenant, please.

216
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,650
What's the cause of this rift between you and Miss Jenny?

217
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,280
I told you, it's complicated. I was born more than two centuries ago,

218
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,890
and my wife is prisoner in some otherworldly realm.

219
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm no stranger to complications. Miss Mills, stop.

220
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,780
What happened with you and your sister is between you and your sister.

221
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,810
But your secret is in the way of a truth we must uncover.

222
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,330
The consequences of keeping this secret could be dire.

223
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,050
I'm gonna trust you with something

224
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,980
that I've never told anybody.

225
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,880
Not a shrink, not a priest, not Sheriff Corbin.

226
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,190
When Jenny and I saw that thing in the woods...

227
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,730
I remember waking up.

228
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,580
Felt like I'd only been asleep a few minutes.

229
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,180
Apparently, it had been four days.

230
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,090
And the whole town had been looking for us.

231
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,640
What the...?

232
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,910
I found them! Hey, over here!

233
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,120
They asked a lot of questions I didn't want to answer.

234
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,010
Someone else was in the woods. Can you describe him?

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,630
I told Jenny, "Don't say anything.

236
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,970
Follow my lead. " She didn't listen.

237
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,280
A man...

238
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,660
come out of the ground.

239
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,160
She told him about what we saw.???

240
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,240
She told him I saw it.??

241
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,690
And that the rancher who found us saw it, too.

242
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,380
When she was done, the doctor turned to me.

243
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,190
Abbie...

244
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,370
did you see this... thing, as well?

245
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,980
No, I didn't see anything.

246
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,670
- Abbie! - It's all right, Jenny.

247
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,050
She's lying!

248
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,450
- I didn't see anything. - Why are you lying?

249
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,770
- I'm not. I didn't see anything. - Why... Abbie. Tell them what you saw.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,210
Tell them what... Don't touch me!

251
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,380
Tell them what you saw, Abbie!

252
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,850
Tell them!

253
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,270
I told Jenny to keep her mouth shut about what we saw.

254
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,190
Our parents were out of the picture, we finally landed in a decent foster home...

255
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,960
Your parents were... "out of the picture. "

256
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,670
That is a story for another day.

257
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,130
The point is, we would have been in enough trouble

258
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,860
if they found out that we were in the woods sneaking beers after school.

259
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,090
But if we started talking about demons and all that, I told her we would be put back in the system.

260
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,070
So you said nothing. Like she should have.

261
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,880
And you were allowed to stay in the foster home while she was relocated.

262
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,460
You were afraid. You lied because you were afraid.

263
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,690
Not only of the creature but of the earthly consequences of your tale.

264
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,620
But you do realize there's no need to be frightened still.

265
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,480
- Sorry? - You were frightened then, you still are today.

266
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,410
- Of what? - Of admitting the truth.

267
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,560
That you turned your back on Miss Jenny.

268
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,510
Look, you're right.

269
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,940
What's between me and my sister is between me and my sister.

270
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,920
She told the doctor that you saw the demon,

271
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,390
and the rancher who found you saw it as well.

272
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,650
Mr. Gillespie?

273
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,490
Yeah.

274
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,910
He never admitted to seeing anything.

275
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,160
Probably because it would have cost him the 15 minutes of fame he got from being a small-town hero.

276
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,880
But he knew. He never told.

277
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,490
We should pay Mr. Gillespie a visit.

278
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
 Paige?

279
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,040
Paige?

280
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,410
Is that you?

281
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,710
Who hung this in my office?

282
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,480
Five people are dead, including two of your own.

283
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,490
And you think, just because you heard a rumor about a headless horseman running around town,

284
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,910
it's all a big joke?

285
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah, it was me, sir. It's just a stupid prank.

286
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,010
You know, something we do when someone new joins the force.

287
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,570
Good one.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,750
Morales, right? Yes, sir.

289
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,400
You used to date Lieutenant Mills. Yeah, how'd you know that, sir?

290
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,170
Assume I know everything.

291
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,570
Captain, we've got a report of shots fired at the Gillespie ranch on Pine Road.

292
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,270
- Tactical's en route. - Copy that.

293
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,320
If you need me, I'll be at the Gillespie ranch.

294
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,190
Captain, what's going on?

295
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,260
What are you two doing here? I didn't call you.

296
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,100
Seems our investigation has dovetailed with yours, sir.

297
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,080
What's going on?

298
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,660
We got a report of shots fired inside the house.

299
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,420
Just pulled up. Found ourselves in a full-on hostage situation.

300
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,950
The suspect has his wife at gunpoint, won't talk to anybody.

301
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,680
I take it the suspect's name is Gillespie.

302
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,920
Captain, Mr. Gillespie is asking to speak to a Lieutenant Mills.

303
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,150
This seems familiar. You got this?

304
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,580
I got it.

305
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,290
Thank you.

306
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,660
Lieutenant Mills is coming in. Copy that. In position.

307
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,990
Mr. Gillespie?

308
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,060
Mr. Gillespie?

309
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,670
It's Abigail Mills from the sheriff's department.

310
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,090
Mr. Gillespie.

311
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. Gillespie?

312
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,680
Stay out. He's lost his mind.

313
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,710
Mr. Gillespie, you wanted to talk to me?

314
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,980
Mr. Gillespie, I'm here to help you.

315
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,450
Let me help you.

316
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,620
You can't help me.

317
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,510
Sure I can.

318
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,260
Let's just talk.

319
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,640
Send in tactical now!

320
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,270
Crane!

321
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,880
Stand by, Captain.

322
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,610
- Hold the team. - Stand down.

323
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,780
Stand down. We're standing down.

324
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,100
We are just fine here, aren't we, Mr. Gillespie?

325
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,170
Mr. Gillespie?

326
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,370
You're gonna let me help you.

327
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,740
You can't help me.

328
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,770
He's coming for you next.

329
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,820
Who is? Who's coming for me? The Sandman.

330
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,970
Next time you fall asleep...

331
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,610
you're dead.

332
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,480
No!

333
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,250
Is there a reason why you're standing alone?

334
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,740
Far removed from everybody else? I'm trying to think.

335
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,150
You know, this isn't your fault either.

336
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,800
I know.

337
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
Just wish I could've done something.

338
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,750
You did your best.

339
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,500
You were right about Jenny.

340
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,880
She's the key to all of this.

341
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,960
Dr. Vega, Mr. Gillespie, me.

342
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,550
None of us did anything to help her even though we knew she was telling the truth.

343
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,210
Mr. Gillespie said that I was next.

344
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,310
The next time I fell asleep... I'm dead.

345
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,530
The Sandman was coming to get me.

346
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,310
Who's the Sandman? Really?

347
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,570
The, uh...

348
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,790
kindly dream giver who sprinkles sand in the eyes of children.

349
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,680
Put 'em to sleep. Sounds barbaric.

350
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,770
What does the Sandman look like? I don't know.

351
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,970
The Sandman.

352
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,650
Is he perhaps a-a... How did you put it?

353
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,580
Faceless nightmare monster?

354
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,290
The one from my dream.

355
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,170
Crane, I think I found something.

356
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,190
I requested coffee from the charwoman in the entrance hall,

357
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,700
but she said you're particular to this beverage.

358
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,050
She's called a receptionist. Or Wendy.

359
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,220
And yes, I am.

360
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,060
It's an energy drink to help keep you awake.

361
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,900
It'll keep me awake.

362
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Potent.

363
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm fine, I'm all right.

364
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Uh, so... you were saying? You have found something.

365
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,600
Yes and no.

366
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,100
Basically, dream spirits have been around as long as humans have been dreaming.

367
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,700
They're mostly easygoing types.

368
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,100
Along the lines of the traditional Sandman.

369
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
But there's others.

370
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,300
Less friendly. Vengeful types.

371
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,800
Does this mean anything to you?

372
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,300
It's from an 18th century Mohawk story about a dream demon.

373
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
- Ro'kenhrontyes. 
- You know him?

374
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
The creature in your nightmare,

375
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
did he have black hollow eye sockets?

376
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,100
- Yeah, he did. 
- And a veil of flesh where his mouth should be?

377
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
- Who is he? 
- A myth.

378
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Clearly one that's become all too real.

379
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,800
I first heard of it from the Mohawks who fought with us in the 37th regiment.

380
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,100
You fought alongside Native Americans?

381
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,200
Fought, plotted, executed various forms of espionage.

382
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,100
Many of our Mohawk friends were colonist spies.

383
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,200
They could infiltrate the ranks of the crown without anyone thinking twice about their presence.

384
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
They were invaluable to the cause.

385
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,700
They told me a fairy tale, a legend spun to frighten the young into a life of righteousness.

386
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,800
"Always do right by your neighbor, children,

387
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,400
"or the spirit of Ro'kenhrontyes will come for you in your dreams. "

388
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Native Americans would draw the symbol in the way we would make the sign of the cross to ward away evil.

389
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,500
Wiroh claimed that the dream spirit killed his father as punishment

390
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,400
for turning a blind eye on his neighbor's plight.

391
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
So if this...

392
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,100
dream demon...

393
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,200
is responsible for Vega and Gillespie and is coming for me, what do I do?

394
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,900
I carve this symbol in my doorstep?

395
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,000
Only if you believe crossing yourself will actually keep the Devil at bay.

396
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,300
Look, I do not want to die because of something I did over ten years ago.

397
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Okay.

398
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
We must visit a Mohawk shaman.

399
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,100
- That's easier said than done. 
- How so?

400
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,700
After the Revolution,

401
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,800
the new government and the Native Americans fought over land.

402
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,800
- There aren't very many of them left anymore. 
- How is that possible?

403
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,100
Their nation stretched the continent.

404
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,900
Their rules for governments formed the very basis

405
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,100
of how we planned to unify 13 diverse states in a single federation.

406
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,900
They were my friends.

407
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,200
Maybe this dream spirit has a long list of people to visit after he's done with me.

408
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,800
A shaman. Is there a place we can find one?

409
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,400
There is a guy.

410
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I don't think it's what you're expecting.

411
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,200
The shaman sells motorized carriages.

412
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
Trucks, motorcycles,

413
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,800
RVs, boats, a little bit of everything.

414
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,300
Welcome to Geronimotors.

415
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,500
Seamus Duncan, owner, manager, and your humble servant.

416
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

417
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
This is my partner Ichabod Crane.

418
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,900
Sheriff said I had 90 days to clean up the environmental waste in the back.

419
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
We're not here about that.

420
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,600
Great. Hey.

421
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,600
You guys into time travel? I got a tricked-out DeLorean in mint condition.

422
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,600
We need your help... Combating the dream spirit.

423
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,000
Ro'kenhrontyes.

424
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,300
Seriously?

425
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,400
You want me to go all kemosabe and cast a spell

426
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,200
and do a rain dance? Get out of here, you jokers.

427
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
It's no joke.

428
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,400
We wouldn't be here if we weren't serious.

429
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,000
He has visited her.

430
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

431
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,300
You want to buy a car? I'm your man.

432
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Otherwise I can't help you.

433
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,500
You understood everything I said.

434
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,300
I recognized the fear in your countenance when I mentioned Ro'kenhrontyes.

435
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,500
He is coming for my friend. What will you do when he comes for you?

436
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
My conscience is clear.

437
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,500
His Honor Edmund Burke once said, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil

438
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,700
is for good men to do nothing. "

439
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,800
And we may all at times stand idly when action is required.

440
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,300
But if you turn your back on Lieutenant Mills, how will you acquit yourself a good man

441
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,600
when Ro'kenhrontyes comes to you in your dreams.

442
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Come on.

443
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I don't know where you came from, but you can drop your "friend of the tribe" stick.

444
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,800
No one's a chief, no one lives in teepees, and no one has powwows.

445
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Got it?

446
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,000
You stopped having powwows?

447
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,900
- I rather enjoyed those. 
- Get in.

448
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,600
- Where are we going? 
- We're taking a little trip.

449
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
First things first.

450
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Ro'kenhrontyes isn't your run-of-the-mill demon.

451
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,100
- There's run-of-the-mill demons? 
- Fair.

452
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,900
Anyway, he doesn't just want to kill you.

453
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
He taunts you first.

454
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,700
He rubs your face in the mess you made.

455
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,500
He drives you to a pain so unimaginable, you willingly take your own life.

456
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Ergo... Dr. Vega and Mr. Gillespie.

457
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
And into the valley of death we go.

458
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,100
The good pass through on their way to Heaven. The evil go straight to Hell.

459
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,900
Those in between, they belong to Ro'kenhrontyes.

460
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,600
If they're not redeemed, he takes their souls to Hell with him.

461
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
- But I can't stop him? 
- Only on his territory.

462
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,000
You drink that tea, you enter his dreamworld.

463
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,300
Then the fight begins.

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
Down the hatch.

465
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,100
once you enter the dream worldthe spirit chooses the challenge you have to face.

466
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,500
You're a living being walking in the valley of death.

467
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,300
So...

468
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,300
- If she dies in the dream? 
- She dies. Period.

469
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I see.

470
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Crane!

471
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,200
Jasmine.

472
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,700
Cherry root.

473
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Hops?

474
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,000
Not bad.

475
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,200
It's certainly preferable to your energy drink.

476
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,000
What are you thinking?

477
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,600
Well, I'm coming with you now, so no point in discussing it.

478
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
The tea will put you to sleep.

479
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,600
The venom will allow you to control your actions while you dream.

480
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,900
It's the venom.

481
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,400
What-what venom?

482
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Their venom.

483
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,900
Is this strictly necessary?

484
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,300
So you don't hurt yourselves. Scorpion stings...

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
they're, um...

486
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
ouch.

487
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
You have to focus now.

488
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,200
Once you enter the dreamworld, the tea will keep you connected.

489
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,200
But only you will know what you have to do to defeat Ro'kenhrontyes.

490
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,300
Is that necessary, the banging?

491
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,300
Lieutenant!

492
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Crane?

493
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Crane?

494
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,500
Lieutenant!

495
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,900
YOU HAVE BEEN WEIGHED ON THE SCALES AND FOUND...

496
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
WANTING

497
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,400
The imagination... It is, uh, it's a powerful thing, Jenny.

498
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,400
What you actually saw was-was likely an animal or a hunter.

499
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
What we saw was a demon!

500
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Tell him.

501
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Did you see this monster, Abbie?

502
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Yes, she did.

503
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
Tell him.

504
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,100
DID YOU SEE HIM?

505
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,200
I've had this coming a long time.

506
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,500
We all have.

507
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,100
He's coming for you next.

508
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,000
Tell them what you saw.

509
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,300
DID YOU SEE THIS MONSTER?

510
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
I didn't see anything.

511
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,700
She's lying.

512
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,700
Why are you lying?!

513
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,500
- I didn't see anything! 
- Tell them what you saw! Abbie?

514
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,700
DID YOU SEE THIS MONSTER?

515
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,600
Why are you lying?!

516
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Tell them what you saw, Abbie!

517
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
Don't touch me!

518
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Tell them what you saw!

519
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,300
Abbie, what's wrong with you?!

520
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Desist, Ro'kenhrontyes!

521
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
YOUR SINS AREN'T MINE TO PUNISH. 

522
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,900
Ichabod Crane.

523
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,600
Leave her be!

524
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
Stop!

525
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,900
I saw... a demon.

526
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,600
I saw a demon in the woods and I lied to protect myself.

527
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
I was a coward and I betrayed my sister.

528
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,600
I turned my back on her when she needed me.

529
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,900
And I will not do it again.

530
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,700
It was my fault.
You can come at me all you want,

531
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,700
but I see you.

532
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm not afraid anymore!

533
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,500
Lieutenant.

534
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,700
- Miss Mills?
- I'm here.

535
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,600
How are you feeling?

536
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Better.

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,400
No more scorpions...

538
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
ever.

539
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,500
Seven years of tribulation, huh?

540
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,900
- According to scripture. 
- How long have we been doing this so far?

541
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,500
I'm certain it will become easier once we get accustomed to...

542
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,400
No, sorry, I'm too tired to lie.

543
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,600
Stay as long as you want.

544
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,900
I have some unfinished business to take care of.

545
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
- How'd you two get in here? 
- The old munitions tunnels.

546
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,300
I broke a wall.

547
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
Why are you in here?

548
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,600
We thought it would be a good spot for us to do our work.

549
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,300
On the premises, but out the way.

550
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Good point.

551
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I agree.

552
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,100
Just don't break any more walls.

553
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
You want access to this place, I'll get you a key.

554
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Thank you, sir.

555
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Captain, would you like to discuss what the lieutenant and I discovered?

556
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,500
- Is it over? 
- Yes.

557
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,300
That's all I need to hear.

558
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,100
It's late. Go home.

559
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,500
Get some sleep.

560
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Listen...

561
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm not really good at this kind of thing, but I...

562
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,300
You're welcome.

563
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,200
You gotta let me get the words out, okay?

564
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,900
The things one most tries to hide are often the things most easily seen.

565
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,800
Which is why I'll add,

566
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
yes.you need to see your sister. "

567
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,900
I am... way ahead of you.

568
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,400
Like I was saying, unfinished business.

569
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,600
- Godspeed. 
- Mm!

570
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,300
Abbie Mills to see Jennifer Mills.

571
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,600
Her visitors log says she refused to see you.

572
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm telling you, if she doesn't want to talk to you, she can be pretty stubborn.

573
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,100
She doesn't have to talk. She just has to listen.

574
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,200
Jenny? You have a visitor.

575
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,300
What the hell?

576
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
She was here at lights out. Where could she have gone?

577
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,800
These doors are electronically locked. We have people watching the ward.

578
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,600
- There's no way out. 
- She found one.

579
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,900
Get the administrator and lock the building down.

580
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,400
She's good.

581
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:17,700
