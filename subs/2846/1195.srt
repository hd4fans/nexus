1
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,839
Hey.

2
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,641
Hey, baby. What's going on here?

3
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,851
Oh , hi .

4
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,082
Miss GoIightIy.

5
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,170
Some day. . . Some day. . .

6
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,881
Miss GoIightIy.

7
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,926
What happened to you , anyway?

8
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,679
You take off for the powder room and that's the Iast I see you .

9
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
-Now, reaIIy, Harry. . . -Harry was the other guy.

10
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm Sid . Sid Arbuck. You Iike me, remember?

11
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,439
Miss GoIightIy, I protest!

12
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,026
Oh , darIing , I am sorry, but I Iost my key.

13
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,944
But that was two weeks ago.

14
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,780
You cannot go on and keep ringing my beII .

15
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,034
You disturb me ! You must have a key made !

16
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,620
But it won't do any good . I just Iose them aII .

17
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,039
Come on , baby. You Iike me. You know you do.

18
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,373
I worship you , Mr Arbuck,

19
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,126
-but good night, Mr Arbuck. -Baby, wait a minute. What is this?

20
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,086
You Iike me. I'm a Iiked guy.

21
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,130
You Iike me, baby. You know you do.

22
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,049
Didn't I pick up the check for five peopIe?

23
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,634
Your friends. I've never seen them before.

24
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,969
And when you asked for a IittIe change for the powder room ,

25
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,804
what do I give you? A $50 biII .

26
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,390
Now doesn't that give me some rights?

27
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,101
In 30 seconds I going to caII the poIice !

28
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,064
AII the time disturbance ! I get no sIeep !

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,733
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

30
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,819
I am going to caII the vice squad on you !

31
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,656
Don't be angry, you dear IittIe man , I won't do it again .

32
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,823
If you promise not to be angry,

33
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,785
I might Iet you take those pictures we mentioned .

34
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,536
When?

35
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,872
Sometime.

36
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,042
Anytime.

37
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,044
Good night.

38
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,632
I'm sorry to bother you , but I couIdn't get the downstairs door open .

39
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,429
I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

40
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,931
I couIdn't get the downstairs door open .

41
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,646
I said , I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

42
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,233
I couIdn't get the downstairs door open . I'm sorry to wake you .

43
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,943
That's quite aII right.

44
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,989
It couId happen to anyone, quite frequentIy does. Good night.

45
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,449
I hate to. . .

46
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,454
I hate to bother you , but if I couId ask one more favour

47
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,331
couId I use the phone?

48
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,084
Sure.

49
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,127
Why not?

50
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,421
Thank you .

51
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,341
WeII , this is

52
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,469
a nice IittIe pIace you've got here.

53
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,348
-You just moved in , too, huh? -No. I've been here about a year.

54
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,517
The phone's over there.

55
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,144
WeII , it was.

56
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,980
Oh , I remember.

57
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,442
I stuck it in the suitcase. Kind of muffIes the sound .

58
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,368
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,788
-Is he aII right? -Sure.

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,374
Sure. He's okay, aren't you , cat?

61
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,334
Poor oId cat.

62
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,547
Poor sIob. Poor sIob without a name.

63
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,258
The way I Iook at it, I don't have the right to give him one.

64
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,761
We don't beIong to each other. We just took up by the river one day.

65
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,429
I don't even want to own anything

66
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,516
untiI I find a pIace where me and things go together.

67
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,145
I'm not sure where that is, but I know what it's Iike.

68
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,231
It's Iike Tiffany's.

69
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,859
Tiffany's? You mean the jeweIIery store?

70
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,193
That's right.

71
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,863
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

72
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,198
Listen .

73
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,994
You know those days when you get the mean reds?

74
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,788
The mean reds? You mean Iike the bIues?

75
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,956
No.

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,209
The bIues are because you're getting fat or maybe it's been raining too Iong .

77
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,211
You're just sad , that's aII .

78
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,797
The mean reds are horribIe.

79
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,134
SuddenIy you're afraid and you don't know what you're afraid of.

80
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,345
-Do you ever get that feeIing? -Sure.

81
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,473
WeII , when I get it, the onIy thing that does any good

82
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,059
is to jump into a cab and go to Tiffany's.

83
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,978
CaIms me down right away.

84
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,814
The quietness and the proud Iook of it.

85
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,400
Nothing very bad couId happen to you there.

86
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,485
If I couId find a reaI-Iife pIace

87
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,238
that made me feeI Iike Tiffany's, then . . .

88
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,409
Then I'd buy some furniture and give the cat a name.

89
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,705
I'm sorry. You wanted something .

90
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,749
The teIephone.

91
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,501
It's just that I was supposed to meet somebody.

92
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,713
I mean , this is 1 0: 00 Thursday morning , isn't it?

93
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,674
I just got off a pIane from Rome and I'm not too sure.

94
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,594
Thursday. Is this Thursday?

95
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,263
-I think so. -Thursday! Oh , no, it can't be !

96
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,932
It's too gruesome.

97
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,188
WeII , what's so gruesome about Thursday?

98
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,274
Nothing , except I can never remember when it's coming up.

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,276
Wednesdays, I generaIIy just don't go to bed at aII

100
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,779
because I have to be up to catch the 1 0:45.

101
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,615
And they're so particuIar about visiting hours.

102
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,617
WouId you be a darIing and Iook under the bed

103
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
and see if you can find a pair of aIIigator shoes?

104
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,120
Sure.

105
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,708
I've got to do something about the way I Iook.

106
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,962
I mean , a girI just can't go to Sing Sing with a green face.

107
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,255
Sing Sing?

108
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,967
Yes, I aIways thought it was a ridicuIous name for a prison .

109
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,054
Sing Sing , I mean . It sounds more Iike it shouId be an opera house or something .

110
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,764
BIack aIIigator.

111
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,893
You know, aII the visitors make an effort to Iook their best. It's onIy fair.

112
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,980
ActuaIIy, it's very touching , aII the women wearing their prettiest things.

113
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,565
I just Iove them for it. And I Iove the kids, too.

114
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,484
I mean the kids the wives bring .

115
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,987
It shouId be sad seeing kids there, but it isn't.

116
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,240
They aII have ribbons in their hair and Iots of shine on their shoes.

117
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,992
You'd think there was going to be ice cream .

118
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,744
Now, as I understand it, what we're doing is getting you ready

119
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,247
-to visit somebody at Sing Sing . -That's right.

120
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,083
You can aIways teII what kind of person a man reaIIy thinks you are

121
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,002
by the earrings he gives you .

122
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,170
I must say, the mind reeIs.

123
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,672
May I ask whom?

124
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,258
Whom what? Oh , whom I go to visit, you mean?

125
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,926
I guess that's what I mean .

126
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,012
I don't know that I shouId even discuss it.

127
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,347
WeII , they never toId me not to teII anyone.

128
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,850
You must cross your heart and kiss your eIbow.

129
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,143
I'II try.

130
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,688
You probabIy read about him . H is name's SaIIy Tomato.

131
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,106
SaIIy Tomato?

132
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,441
WeII , don't Iook so shocked .

133
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,775
They couId never prove for a second

134
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,278
that he was even part of the Mafia, much Iess head of it, my dear.

135
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,197
The onIy thing they did prove was that he cheated his income tax a IittIe.

136
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,867
Anyway, aII I know is that he's a darIing oId man .

137
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,202
Oh , he was never my Iover or anything Iike that.

138
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,455
In fact, I never knew him untiI after he was in prison .

139
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,706
But I adore him now.

140
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,625
I mean , I've been going to see him every Thursday for seven months.

141
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,045
Now I think I'd go even if he didn't pay me.

142
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,130
-Shoes. -I couId onIy find one.

143
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,719
He pays you?

144
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,971
That's right. Or anyway his Iawyer does.

145
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,724
If he is a Iawyer, which I doubt, since he doesn't seem to have an office,

146
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,225
onIy an answering service.

147
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,187
And he aIways wants to meet you at Hamburger Heaven .

148
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,983
There you are, you sneak. Thank you .

149
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,151
You're weIcome.

150
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,195
Dress. Dress.

151
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,573
Here we are. Bag and a hat, too.

152
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,992
There we are.

153
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,746
Anyway, about seven months ago, this so-caIIed Iawyer, Mr O'Shaughnessy,

154
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,915
asked me how I'd Iike to cheer up a IoneIy oId man

155
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,417
and pick up $ 1 00 a week at the same time.

156
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,088
I toId him , "Look, darIing , you've got the wrong HoIIy GoIightIy."

157
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,840
A girI can do as weII as that on trips to the powder room .

158
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,759
I mean , any gentIeman with the sIightest chic

159
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,011
wiII give a girI a $50 biII for the powder room .

160
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,764
And I aIways ask for cab fare, too. That's another $50.

161
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,225
But then he said his cIient was SaIIy Tomato.

162
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,228
He said dear oId SaIIy had seen me at EImo's or somewhere

163
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,438
and had admired me à la distance.

164
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,274
So wouIdn't it be a good deed if I were to visit him once a week?

165
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,444
WeII , how couId I say no? It was aII so wiIdIy romantic.

166
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,864
How do I Iook?

167
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,035
Very good . I must say I'm amazed .

168
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,580
You were a darIing to heIp, I couId never have done it without you .

169
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
-Bag . -CaII me anytime.

170
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,213
I'm just upstairs, or I wiII be as soon as I get moved in .

171
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,381
Bye, cat.

172
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,641
You mean he gives you $ 1 00 for an hour's conversation?

173
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,810
WeII , Mr O'Shaughnessy does as soon as I meet him

174
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
and give him the weather report.

175
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,189
Look, it's none of my business, but it sounds to me

176
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,024
Iike you couId get in a Iot of troubIe.

177
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,860
HoId this for me, wiII you?

178
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,823
And what do you mean , "weather report"?

179
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,701
Oh , that's just a message I give Mr O'Shaughnessy.

180
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,162
So he'II know I've reaIIy been up there.

181
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,497
SaIIy teIIs me things to say Iike

182
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,791
"There's a hurricane in Cuba"

183
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,836
and , "It's cIoudy over PaIermo." Things Iike that.

184
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,381
You don't have to worry. I've taken care of myseIf for a Iong time.

185
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,724
Taxi !

186
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,901
-I never couId do that. -It's easy.

187
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,410
PauI .

188
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,788
I'm Iate. I know it.

189
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,085
Don't teII me you were Iocked out? Didn't you get the key?

190
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,088
Oh , darIing . I'm so sorry.

191
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,842
No, I got the key, aII right.

192
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,179
Miss GoIightIy, my neighbour, was kind enough to Iet me in .

193
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,848
Miss GoIightIy's on her way to Sing Sing .

194
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,017
-Oh? -Just visiting , of course.

195
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,854
Miss GoIightIy, Mrs FaIenson , my decorator.

196
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,774
-How do you do? -How do you do?

197
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,278
DarIing . Let me Iook at you .

198
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,864
-Are you through? -Was the fIight absoIuteIy ghastIy?

199
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,574
I'm in a terribIe rush .

200
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,953
Grand CentraI Station , and step on it, darIing .

201
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,916
Is it reaIIy onIy three weeks since I Ieft you in Rome?

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,584
Seems Iike years.

203
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,962
-You seen the apartment? -Not yet.

204
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,507
I know it was wicked of me, but I couIdn't resist.

205
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,634
I went ahead and fixed it up without you .

206
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,135
I think it's darIing of course

207
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,473
but if you absoIuteIy hate it, we can rip everything up and start from scratch .

208
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,987
Miss GoIightIy!

209
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,241
Hey, baby! Where you going?

210
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,538
Come on , baby. Open the door.

211
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,416
Be a paI .

212
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,961
You're breaking up a beautifuI party.

213
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,632
Come on , baby. Open the door.

214
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,051
Hey, the band's swinging .

215
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,388
Come on , baby.

216
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,227
Miss GoIightIy. Once again , I must protest!

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
If you don't stop that phonograph right this minute,

218
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm going to caII the poIice department!

219
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,696
Yeah . That's more better.

220
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,201
What's the matter, baby?

221
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,627
Come on . You're a great kid . Open the door.

222
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,132
Come on , baby. I'm waiting for you .

223
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,487
-It's aII right. It's onIy me. -Now, wait a minute. Miss. . .

224
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,698
GoIightIy. HoIIy GoIightIy.

225
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,076
I Iive downstairs. We met this morning , remember?

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,244
Yeah .

227
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,872
It's aII right. She's gone.

228
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,751
I must say, she works Iate hours for a decorator.

229
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,587
The thing is, I have the most terrifying man downstairs.

230
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,631
I mean , he's sweet when he isn't drunk

231
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,093
but Iet him start Iapping up the vino, and oh , goIIy, quel beast.

232
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,430
It finaIIy got so tiresome down there, I just went out the window.

233
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,770
Look, you can throw me out if you want to,

234
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,023
but you did Iook so cosy in here, and your decorator friend had gone home

235
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,777
and it was beginning to get a bit coId out there on the fire escape.

236
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,822
And I aIways heard peopIe in New York

237
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,032
never get to know their neighbours.

238
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,579
WeII , how was Sing Sing?

239
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,205
Fine.

240
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,584
I made the train and everything .

241
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,794
And what's the weather report?

242
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,548
"SmaII-craft warnings BIock IsIand to Hatteras."

243
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
Whatever that means.

244
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,055
You know, you're sweet. You reaIIy are.

245
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,935
And you Iook a IittIe Iike my brother Fred .

246
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,396
Do you mind if I caII you Fred?

247
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,856
Not at aII .

248
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,404
$300, she's very generous.

249
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,241
Is it by the week, the hour or what?

250
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,076
Okay, the party's over. Out.

251
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,121
Oh , Fred . DarIing Fred , I'm sorry.

252
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,750
I didn't mean to hurt your feeIings. Don't be angry.

253
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,003
I was just trying to Iet you know I understand .

254
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,963
I understand compIeteIy.

255
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,258
It's okay, stick around . Make yourseIf a drink.

256
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,676
Throw me my robe and I'II make you one.

257
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,053
You stay right where you are.

258
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,388
You must be absoIuteIy exhausted .

259
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,808
I mean , it is very Iate

260
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,310
and you were sound asIeep and everything .

261
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,023
I suppose you think I'm very brazen or très fou or something .

262
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,150
I don't think you're any fouer than anybody eIse.

263
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,986
Yes, you do. Everybody does. And I don't mind .

264
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,448
It's usefuI being top banana in the shock department.

265
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,453
What do you do, anyway?

266
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,290
-I'm a writer, I guess. -You guess? Don't you know?

267
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,294
Okay. Positive statement. Ringing affirmative.

268
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,588
I'm a writer.

269
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,176
The onIy writer I've ever been out with is Benny ShackIett.

270
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,638
He's written an awfuI Iot of teIevision stuff, but quel rat.

271
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,267
TeII me, are you a reaI writer?

272
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,479
I mean , does anybody buy what you write or pubIish it or anything?

273
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,732
They bought what's in that box.

274
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,318
Yours?

275
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,029
AII these books?

276
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,906
WeII , there's just the one book.

277
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,408
TweIve copies of it.

278
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,702
"Nine Lives by PauI Varjak."

279
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,371
They're stories.

280
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,415
N ine of them .

281
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,418
TeII me one.

282
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,297
They're not the kind of stories you can reaIIy teII .

283
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,590
Too dirty?

284
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,012
Yeah , I suppose they're dirty, too, but onIy incidentaIIy.

285
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,183
MainIy they're angry, sensitive, intenseIy feIt

286
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,478
and that dirtiest of aII dirty words, promising .

287
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,275
Or so said The Times Book Review, October 1 st, 1 956.

288
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,278
-1 956? -That's right.

289
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,783
I suppose this is kind of a ratty question , but what have you written IateIy?

290
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,870
LateIy I've been working on a noveI .

291
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,290
-LateIy, since 1 956? -WeII , a noveI takes a Iong time.

292
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,085
-I want to get it exactIy right. -So no more stories.

293
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,795
WeII , the idea is

294
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,174
I'm supposed to not fritter my taIent away on IittIe things.

295
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,801
I'm supposed to be saving it for the big one.

296
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,846
TeII me, do you write every day?

297
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,014
Sure.

298
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,475
-Today? -Sure.

299
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,728
-It's a beautifuI typewriter. -Of course.

300
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,148
It writes nothing but sensitive, intenseIy feIt, promising prose.

301
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,150
But there's no ribbon in it.

302
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,819
-There isn't? -No.

303
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,530
Oh .

304
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,577
You know, something you said this morning has been

305
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,287
bothering me aII day.

306
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,664
What's that?

307
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,501
Do they reaIIy give you $50 whenever you go to the powder room?

308
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,835
Of course.

309
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,672
You must do very weII .

310
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,008
I'm trying to save, but I'm not very good at it.

311
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,892
You know, you do Iook a Iot Iike my brother Fred .

312
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,605
I haven't seen him , of course, since I was 1 4. That's when I Ieft home.

313
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,941
And he was aIready 6'2".

314
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,404
I guess it must have been the peanut butter that did it.

315
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,700
Everybody thought he was dotty the way he gorged himseIf on peanut butter.

316
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,452
But he wasn't dotty.

317
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,873
Just sweet and vague and terribIy sIow.

318
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,713
Poor Fred . He's in the army now.

319
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,050
It's reaIIy the best pIace for him untiI I can get enough money saved .

320
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,137
-And then? -And then Fred and I . . .

321
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,890
I went to Mexico once.

322
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,269
It's a wonderfuI pIace for raising horses.

323
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,772
I saw one pIace near the sea that. . .

324
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,942
Fred's very good with horses.

325
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,571
But even Iand in Mexico costs something .

326
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,073
And no matter what I do, there never seems to be more than

327
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,576
a coupIe of hundred doIIars in the bank.

328
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,246
It can't be 4: 30.

329
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,082
It just can't.

330
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,591
Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?

331
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,595
It's aII right. ReaIIy, it is.

332
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,973
We're friends, that's aII .

333
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,687
We are friends, aren't we?

334
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,106
Sure.

335
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,032
Okay.

336
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,285
Let's don't say another word .

337
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,455
Let's just go to sIeep.

338
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,646
Where are you , Fred?

339
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,817
Because it's coId .

340
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,949
There's snow and wind .

341
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,329
What is it? What's the matter?

342
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,792
Why are you crying?

343
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,510
If we're going to be friends, Iet's just get one thing straight right now.

344
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,138
I hate snoops.

345
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,400
-Yeah . -Lucille, darling? 2-E.

346
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,571
I've been trying desperateIy to reach you .

347
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,072
BiII just got back.

348
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,866
A day earIy, the beast.

349
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,243
So I'm afraid I'II have to beg off.

350
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,787
You'II expIain to the rest of the girIs?

351
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,582
You're a darIing .

352
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,418
Maybe we can have a Iong Iunch tomorrow.

353
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,254
I'II phone you in the morning .

354
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,423
Whatever you say.

355
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,718
And you wiII manage to survive without me tonight?

356
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,928
Sure.

357
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,598
I might even take a wiId , boyish fIing at writing .

358
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,935
-Good night. -Good night.

359
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,921
You got yourseIf stuffed , huh , PoIIy, baby?

360
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,465
Serves you right, big mouth .

00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,806
-Buongiorno. -H uh?

362
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,350
Aren't you drinking?

363
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,481
You got pockets there or something? What do you go by?

364
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,277
What's your name? What's your name? What do you caII yourseIf?

365
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,905
-Irving . -Perfect. Perfect.

00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,782
That's wonderfuI , Irving .

Now don't get yourseIf aII tense and sore, paI . Come on in .

371
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,929
It's a party. There's a Iot of characters come around here, they're not expected .

372
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,180

Hey, honey, your skirt's spIit there.

-What do you drink, kid? -Bourbon .

377
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,315
Bourbon?

378
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,608
-On the rocks? -Yeah . No. With water.

379
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,444
AII right, you want rocks first, though , don't you?

380
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,862
-Yeah . -Good , you got them .

381
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,698
-Not too much . -AII right. That'II set you free.

382
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,826
-You know the kid Iong? -Not very. I Iive upstairs.

383
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,120
You're kidding . Boy, Iook at this pIace, wiII you?

384
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,914
What a pIace. It's unbeIievabIe. What a dump.

385
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,333
What do you think?

386
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,169
-About what? -Is she or isn't she?

387
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,671
Wait a minute. HoId it.

00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,217

396
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,986
I brought you a house present, something for the bookcase.

397
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,738
You're sweet.

398
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,159
Doesn't that Iook nice? Give me a cigarette, O.J .

399

O.J . 's a great agent. He knows a terrific Iot of phone numbers.

401
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,664
What's Jerry WaId's phone number, O.J . ?

402
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:29,832
Oh , come on , Iay off.

Yeah , I got it.

405
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,256
Stop bIushing , Fred . You didn't say you were genius, I did .

406
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,343
So quit staIIing , O.J . Just teII me what you're going to do

00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,014
Now why don't you Iet Fred baby and me settIe that matter, huh , puppy?

409
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,266
Okay. But just remember, I'm the agent.

410
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,852
He's aIready got a decorator, I'm the agent.

00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,397
HoId it. HoId it.

415
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,118
-No, it's PauI baby. -Oh , it is? I thought it was Fred baby.

416
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,285
-No. -WeII , answer the question , aII right?

417
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,205
-Is she or isn't she? -Is she or isn't she what?

418
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,790
A phoney.

419
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,126
I don't know. I don't think so.

420
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,796
You don't think so, huh? WeII , you're wrong , she is.

421
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,967
But on the other hand , you're right, because she's a reaI phoney.

422
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,636
You know why? Because she honestIy beIieves aII this phoney junk

423
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
that she beIieves in .

424
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:28,224
I mean it. Now Iook, I Iike the kid . I mean , I sincereIy Iike the kid . I do.

425
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,809
I mean , I'm sensitive, that's why.

426
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,145
I mean , you gotta be sensitive to Iike the kid , you know what I mean?

427
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,896
It's what you caII a touch , a streak of the poet,

428
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,981
you know what I mean?

429
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,232
You known her Iong?

430
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,733
Are you kidding? I'm the guy that discovered her.

431
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:38,985
I'm O.J . Berman .

432
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,570
A coupIe of years ago, back on the coast there.

433
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,156
She was just a kid . Of course, she had a Iot of styIe. A Iot of cIass.

434
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,491
-A Iot of what? -CIass. I said she had Iot of cIass.

435
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,243
But of course, when she opened her mouth ,

436
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,996
you didn't know what she was taIking , whether she was a hiIIbiIIy or an Okie.

437
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,998
You know how Iong it took me to smooth out that accent?

438
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,332
-No. -I'II teII you how Iong .

439
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,626
One year. You know how we did it?

440
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,336
We gave her French Iessons. Yeah .

441
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,838
Figured once she couId imitate French ,

442
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,840
she'd have no troubIe imitating EngIish .

443
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,010
And , finaIIy, when I thought she'd be ready, I arranged for a IittIe screen test.

444
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,596
WeII , the night before the screen test. . . WeII , I couId've kiIIed myseIf.

445
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,514
The night before the screen test, the phone rings.

446
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,683
I pick it up, I said , "O.J . speaking ." She says, "This is HoIIy."

447
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,019
I says, "HoIIy? HoIIy, you sound so far away, honey. What's with you?"

448
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,187
She says, "I'm in New York."

449
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,605
I said , "What? You got a screen test tomorrow."

450
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,024
She says, "I'm in New York because I've never been to New York before."

451
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,358
I said , "Get yourseIf on the pIane. Get back here."

452
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,526
She says, "I don't wanna."

453
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,612
I say, "What do you mean , you don't wanna? What do you want?"

454
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,697
She says, "I don't wanna." I say, "What do you want?"

455
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,617
She says, "When I find out what I want, I'm gonna Iet you know." Bang .

456
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,536
-So, Iook, Fred baby, you know. . . -It's PauI baby.

457
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,955
PauI baby. Sure. I mean , don't teII me that she isn't a phoney.

458
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,123
You know what I mean?

459
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,126
Irving . Honey, Irving , where have you been?

460
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,311
Great, thanks.

461
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,189
Mike, darIing , I tried reaching you aII day Iong .

462
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,483
Your answering service doesn't answer.

463
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,276
You know the troubIe peopIe have with answering services.

464
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,029
WeII , I guess so. CarefuI your mother never. . .

465
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,156
She's been running around .

466
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,242
You Iook so wonderfuI .

467
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,246
I know. And after aII that she said about him , and he knows that.

468
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,123
HoIIy.

469
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,466
-Time, darIing . -What?

470
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,717
The time?

471
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,427
-Do you have a watch? -No, I don't.

472
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,973
-Let me see it. It's 6:45. -Thank you so much , dear.

473
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,976
Can I borrow it?

474
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,152
ReaIIy, was that necessary?

475
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,672
This is some party. Who are aII these peopIe, anyhow?

476
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,924
Who knows? The word gets out.

477
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,468
You don't mind , do you , darIing?

478
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,221
Reinforcements.

479
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,352
-Where do I put it? -Right in there.

480
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,284
HoIIy.

481
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,080
HoIIy, darIing .

482
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,876
-What's that? -Mag WiIdwood .

483
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,921
She's a modeI , beIieve it or not, and a thumping bore.

484
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,467
But just Iook at the goodies she brought with her.

485
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,222
He's aII right, I suppose, if you Iike dark, handsome, rich-Iooking men

486
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,391
with passionate natures and too many teeth .

487
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,977
I don't mean that one. I mean the other one.

488
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,691
-The other one? -He's Rusty TrawIer.

489
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,069
Rusty TrawIer.

490
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,864
He happens to be the ninth-richest man in America under 50.

491
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,745
Now that indeed is a remarkabIe piece of information to have at your fingertips.

492
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,747
I keep track of these things.

493
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,126
-Excuse me. You owe me $47. . . -HoId this a minute, wiII you , darIing?

494
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,798
Mag , darIing , what are you doing here?

495
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,635
Honey, I was upstairs working with Yunioshi .

496
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,012
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

497
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,307
Then these two nice boys came to pick me up.

498
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:42,061
It was a mistake, of course. My wires got crossed somewhere.

499
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,563
They were both very sweet about it.

500
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,109
May I present José da SiIva Pereira?

501
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,444
He's from BraziI .

502
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,363
Miss GoIightIy.

503
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,660
Very kind of you , Miss GoIightIy, to aIIow me to attend your party.

504
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,496
I'm so interested in North American cuIture.

505
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,582
I've been aIready, of course, to the Statue of Liberty

506
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,127
and to the restaurant Automatique.

507
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:10,464
But this is the first time I'm in a typicaI North American home.

508
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,093
WouIdn't he just meIt in your mouth?

509
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,928
And this is Mr Rusty TrawIer.

510
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,471
Miss GoIightIy.

511
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,932
You're not vexed at me for bringing them?

512
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,143
-Of course not, darIing . -I'm gIad .

513
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,229
Now, who's going to bring me a bourbon?

514
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,106
-O.J . -Yeah?

515
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,026
-WouId you get Miss WiIdwood a drink? -Yeah . Which one's Miss WiIdwood?

516
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:35,239
Mr Berman , we haven't been formaIIy introduced ,

517
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,659
but I'm Mag WiIdwood from WiIdwood , Arkansas.

518
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,453
That's hiII country.

519
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,371
You just make yourseIf right at home, senhor.

520
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,789
Oh , do not troubIe yourseIf.

521
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:47,877
I'm contented to stand observing the customs of your country.

522
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,336
Okay, you do that.

523
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,547
Now, come aIong , Mr TrawIer.

524
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,383
Let's see what we can find to amuse you with .

525
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,275
Oh , no.

526
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,028
No, no, no.

527
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,085
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

528
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,504
You said you wouId pick me up, and at the Iast minute, I had GiI come. . .

529
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,757
Look, I wasn't supposed to pick you up, here or anywhere.

530
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,930
-Yes? -Miss GoIightIy?

531
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,558
This time I'm warning you .

532
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,562
I am definiteIy this time going to caIIing the poIice !

533
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,955
Good evening .

534
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,125
Is it something important?

535
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,127
No. Just the guy upstairs.

536
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,628
CompIaining about the noise.

537
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,963
He's angry.

538
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,091
WeII , he did mention something about caIIing the poIice.

539
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,677
Oh , the poIice. The poIice?

540
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,431
Oh . That I cannot have. I'd better Iook for Miss WiIdwood and go.

541
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,186
To think I'd find a beau of mine,

542
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,315
mousing after a piece of cheap HoIIywood trash .

543
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,109
-Mag , darIing , you're being a bore. -Shut up.

544
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,697
You . You know what's going to happen to you?

545
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:27,119
I am going to march you over to the zoo and feed you to the yak.

546
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,122
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

547
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,467
Timber!

548
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,809
Sorry.

549
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,271
Good evening , Ed .

550
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,564
-It's PauI baby. -Oh , yes.

551
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,232
-You remember Irving , don't you? -Yeah . H i , Irving .

552
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,651
-This is José. -N ice to meet you , José.

553
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,404
-WonderfuI seeing you . -Yes.

554
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,281
JeweI thieves.

555
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,685
SaIIy heIps me with my accounts.

556
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,979
I have no head for figures at aII .

557
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,858
I'm trying desperateIy to save some money. You know, I toId you .

558
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,651
I just can't seem to.

559
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,279
He makes me write down everything in there.

560
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,323
What I get, what I spend .

561
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,869
I used to have a checking account, but he made me get rid of that.

562
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:19,124
He feeIs, for me, anyway, that it's better to operate on a cash basis, tax-wise.

563
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,505
Some day, Mr Fred , you take this book, turn it into a noveI .

564
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,300
Everything is there. Just fiII in a IittIe of the detaiIs.

565
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,636
CertainIy wouId be good for some Iaughs.

566
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,971
No. No, I don't think so.

567
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,808
This is a book wouId break the heart.

568
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,978
"Mr Fitzsimmons, powder room , $50."

569
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,231
"Less $ 1 8."

570
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,234
"Repair one bIack satin dress."

571
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,444
"Cat food , 27 cents."

572
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,156
SaIIy, darIing , pIease stop. You're making me bIush .

573
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,952
But you're right about Jack Fitzsimmons, he's an absoIute rat.

574
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,039
I guess, of course, I don't reaIIy know anybody but rats.

575
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,291
Except, of course, Fred here.

576
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,461
You do think Fred is nice, don't you , SaIIy?

577
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,631
For you , I hope he is.

578
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,973
Give me a kiss goodbye.

579
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,644
Goodbye, U ncIe SaIIy. TiII next week.

580
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,397
Goodbye, U ncIe SaIIy.

581
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,440
Goodbye and don't forget to send that book, eh?

582
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,733
I won't.

583
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,405
What about the weather report?

584
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,739
Oh , yes.

585
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,368
Snow fIurries expected this weekend in New OrIeans.

586
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,042
Snow fIurries expected this weekend in New OrIeans?

587
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,670
Isn't that just the weirdest?

588
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,215
I bet they haven't had snow in New OrIeans for a miIIion years.

589
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,926
I don't know how he thinks them up.

590
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,984
Moon River

591
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,446
Wider than a mile

592
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:17,242
l'm crossing you in style

593
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,204
Some day

594
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,084
Oh, dream maker

595
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:31,048
You heartbreaker

596
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,552
Wherever you're going

597
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,556
l'm going your way

598
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:45,312
Two drifters

599
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,441
Off to see the world

600
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:54,196
There's such a lot of world

601
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,657
To see

602
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,787
We're after

603
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,582
The same

604
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,754
Rainbow's end

605
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,342
Waiting 'round the bend

606
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:21,807
My huckleberry friend

607
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,352
Moon River

608
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,816
And me

609
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,952
-H i . -H i .

610
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,663
-What you doing? -Writing .

611
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,998
Good .

612
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,842
WeII , heIIo.

613
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,013
-What's wrong? -I don't know.

614
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,515
It's probabIy nothing .

615
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,352
I want to see if he's stiII there.

616
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,480
See if who's stiII there? What are you taIking about?

617
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,027
Look.

618
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,996
See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon .

619
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:30,042
I didn't say anything , I didn't want to sound neurotic

620
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,837
-but when he's there again today. . . -Who do you think he is?

621
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,632
It couId be anybody, of course, but what crossed my mind was

622
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,636
suppose BiII's having us watched , huh?

623
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,558
Okay, I'II take care of this.

624
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,895
No. No, don't. PIease.

625
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,648
Look, if that's what it is, you'II onIy make everything worse.

626
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,901
I'II be carefuI . You wait here.

627
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,653
DarIing , pIease don't. I don't think you shouId .

628
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,072
Now take it easy.

629
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,033
I just want to find out what this is aII about.

630
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,265
AII right, what do you want?

631
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,977
Son , I need a friend .

632
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,825
That's me. That's her.

633
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,286
That's her brother Fred .

634
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,713
You're HoIIy's father?

635
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,841
Her name ain't HoIIy.

636
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,385
She was LuIa Mae Barnes.

637
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,513
Was tiII she married me.

638
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,848
I'm her husband , Doc GoIightIy.

639
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,810
PauI Varjak.

640
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,397
I'm a horse doctor. AnimaI man .

641
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,567
Do some farming , too, near TuIip, Texas.

642
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,571
Her brother Fred's getting out of the army soon .

643
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,323
LuIa Mae beIongs home with her husband ,

644
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,242
her brother and her chiIdren .

645
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,493
ChiIdren?

646
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,663
Them's her chiIdren .

647
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,706
She's got four chiIdren?

648
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,252
Now, son , I didn't cIaim they was her naturaI-born chiIdren .

649
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,171
Their own precious mother, precious woman

650
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,841
passed away J uIy the 4th , Independence Day, 1 955,

651
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,510
the year of the drought.

652
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,388
When I married LuIa Mae, she was going on 1 4.

653
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,349
Now, you might think the average person going on 1 4

654
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,226
wouIdn't know his own mind .

655
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,311
But you take LuIa Mae.

656
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,022
She was an exceptionaI person .

657
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
I'II teII you , son ,

658
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,448
she just pIumb broke our hearts when she run off Iike she done.

659
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,367
Just pIain had no reason .

660
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,787
AII the housework was done by her daughters.

661
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,081
LuIa Mae couId just take it easy.

662
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,126
I teII you , that woman got positiveIy fat

663
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,421
whiIe her brother, he growed up into a giant.

664
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,258
Which is a sight different from the way they come to us.

665
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,927
A coupIe of wiId young'uns, they was.

666
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,723
I caught them outside the house steaIing miIk and turkey eggs.

667
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,891
LuIa Mae and her brother had been Iiving

668
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:00,061
with some mean , no-account peopIe about 1 00 miIe east of TuIip.

669
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,231
She had good cause to run off from that house.

670
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,317
Never had none to Ieave mine.

671
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:10,238
What about her brother? Didn't he Ieave, too?

672
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,991
No, sir. We had Fred with us tiII they took him in the army.

673
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,869
That's what I come to taIk to her about. I had a Ietter from him .

674
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,746
He's getting out of the army in February.

675
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,540
That's why I got on a Greyhound bus to come to get her.

676
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:24,336
LuIa Mae's pIace is with her husband , her chiIdren , and her brother.

677
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,255
H uh?

678
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,050
It's the prize in the Cracker Jack. You want it?

679
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,971
Never couId understand why that woman run off.

680
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,600
Don't teII me she weren't happy.

681
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,186
TaIky as a jaybird she was.

682
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,563
With something smart to say on every subject.

683
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,440
Better than the radio.

684
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,401
The night I proposed , I cried Iike a baby.

685
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,696
She said , "What you want to cry for, Doc? Of course we'II be married .

686
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,907
"I've never been married before."

687
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,869
WeII , I had to Iaugh and to hug and to squeeze her.

688
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,497
"Never been married before."

689
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,712
Listen , son . I advised you I need a friend .

690
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,883
'Cause I don't want to surprise or scare her none.

691
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,552
Be my friend . Let her know I'm here.

692
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,814
WiII you do that for me, son?

693
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,238
Yeah , sure, Doc. If that's what you want.

694
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,699
Come on .

695
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,670
AII right.

696
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,755
Coming .

697
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,803
Oh , darIing , I'm just on my way out.

698
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,097
I was supposed to be at 2 1 haIf an hour ago.

699
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,474
Maybe we can have a drink or something tomorrow, huh?

700
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,184
Sure, LuIa Mae,

701
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,687
if you're stiII here tomorrow.

702
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,943
Oh , pIease, where is he?

703
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,824
Fred?

704
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,952
Gosh .

705
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,871
LuIa Mae.

706
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,797
Gee, honey, don't they feed you up here? You're so skinny.

707
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:41,556
-H i , Doc. -Gosh , LuIa Mae.

708
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,350
Kingdom come.

709
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,496
What is it? What's the matter? Are you aII right?

710
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,082
I guess so. No, I'm not.

711
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,709
-Fred , wiII you heIp me? -If I can .

712
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,045
I want you to come to the bus station with us, Doc and me.

713
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,297
-What? -He stiII thinks I'm going back with him .

714
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,758
I need support. I don't think I can pIay this scene aIone.

715
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,510
HoIIy, what can I do? He's your husband .

716
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,346
-No, he's not. -He's not?

717
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,808
It was annuIIed ages ago, but he just won't accept it.

718
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,936
PIease, Fred . I'II teII him you're coming to see us off.

719
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,729
Don't say anything .

720
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:16,192
Just meet us out front in about an hour. PIease?

721
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,493
You wait right here, honey. I'II get the bag .

722
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,082
Why don't I get some magazines?

723
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,376
PIease, Fred . Don't Ieave me.

724
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,044
Attention, please.

725
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,089
Leaving from platform five, through coach to Dallas,

726
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,800
Philadelphia, Columbus, lndianapolis, Terre Haute,

727
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,220
St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Denison, Dallas.

728
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,180
Come on , LuIa Mae. That's us.

729
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,391
Doc, I'm not coming with you .

730
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:52,437
Come on . Let's waIk together quietIy and I'II try and heIp you understand .

731
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,314
HeIp me taIk to him , Fred .

732
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,440
It's aII right, son .

733
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,902
I appreciate you wanna heIp, but it's between LuIa Mae and me.

734
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,320
Sure, Doc.

735
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,491
I Iove you , LuIa Mae.

736
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,411
I know you do, and that's just the troubIe.

737
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,998
It's a mistake you aIways made, Doc, trying to Iove a wiId thing .

738
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,751
You were aIways Iugging home wiId things.

739
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,337
Once it was a hawk with a broken wing

740
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,715
and another time it was a fuII-grown wiIdcat with a broken Ieg .

741
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,966
Remember?

742
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,217
LuIa Mae, there's something . . .

743
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,678
You mustn't give your heart to a wiId thing .

744
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,722
The more you do, the stronger they get.

745
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,225
U ntiI they're strong enough to run into the woods or fIy into a tree.

746
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,937
And then to a higher tree and then to the sky.

747
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,689
LuIa Mae, there's something I got to teII you .

748
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,609
A coupIe of weeks ago, I got a Ietter from young Fred .

749
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,695
From Fred? He's aII right, isn't he?

750
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,698
Yeah , he's fine, I guess.

751
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,408
He's getting out of the army in February.

752
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,453
-That's what he wrote to teII me. -In February?

753
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,705
WeII , that's onIy four months.

754
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,916
So you see, you got to come back with me, LuIa Mae.

755
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,251
Your pIace is with me and your chiIdren and your brother.

756
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,754
Doc, you've got to understand . I can't come back.

757
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,256
And you got to understand what I'm trying to teII you .

758
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,218
Now, I don't want to seem Iike I'm pressuring you none, but now I got to.

759
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,636
If you don't come back with me,

760
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,721
I'm gonna have to write young Fred and teII him that

761
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,474
unIess he wants to Iook out for hisseIf, he better sign up for another hitch .

762
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,102
Doc, don't you do that. Don't write that to him .

763
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,729
I'II write him myseIf and teII him I want him here with me.

764
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,356
I'II take care of him . Don't you worry.

765
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,941
You're taIking crazy, LuIa Mae.

766
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,361
Doc, stop caIIing me that. I'm not LuIa Mae any more.

767
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,036
AII right, LuIa Mae.

768
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,456
I guess you know what you're doing .

769
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,926
Keep an eye on her, wiII you , son?

770
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,346
At Ieast see she eats something once in a whiIe.

771
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,931
Sure, Doc.

772
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,519
So skinny.

773
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,665
PIease, Doc. PIease understand .

774
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,586
I Iove you , but I'm just not LuIa Mae any more.

775
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,591
I'm not.

776
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,297
You know the terribIe thing , Fred , darIing?

777
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,091
I am stiII LuIa Mae.

778
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:12,303
Fourteen years oId , steaIing turkey eggs and running through a briar patch .

779
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,976
But now I caII it having the mean reds.

780
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,403
WeII , it's stiII too earIy to go to Tiffany's.

781
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,989
I guess the next best thing is a drink.

782
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,159
Yes, I very much need a drink.

783
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,538
-WiII you buy me one, Fred , darIing? -Sure.

784
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:44,168
OnIy promise me one thing . Don't take me home untiI I'm drunk.

785
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,714
U ntiI I'm very drunk indeed .

786
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,252
Do you think she's taIented?

787
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:30,214
-DeepIy and importantIy taIented? -No.

788
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,426
AmusingIy and superficiaIIy taIented , yes,

789
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:37,388
but deepIy and importantIy, no.

790
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,953
Gracious.

791
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,790
Do you think she's handsomeIy paid?

792
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,088
Oh , indeed .

793
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,342
WeII , Iet me teII you something , mister.

794
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,762
If I had her money, I'd be richer than she is.

795
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,265
-How do you figure that? -Because I'd keep the candy store.

796
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,977
OId SaIIy Tomato. That's my candy store.

797
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,313
I'd aIways keep SaIIy.

798
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,149
And that's why I'd be richer than she is.

799
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,112
We'd better get a IittIe more air.

800
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,375
. . .Tom , Dick, and Harry. No. Correction .

801
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,003
Every Tom , Dick and Sid , Harry was his friend .

802
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:56,384
Anyway, every Tom , Dick and Sid thinks that if he takes a girI to dinner,

803
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:01,013
she'II just curI up Iike a kitten in a IittIe furry baII at his feet, right?

804
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,100
I have by actuaI count been taken to dinner

805
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,311
by 26 different rats in the Iast two months.

806
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,439
Twenty-seven , if you count Benny ShackIett,

807
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,650
who is in many ways a super-rat.

808
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:16,320
-I think I forgot my key. -Never mind . I just buzzed Yunioshi .

809
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,573
Do you wanna know something funny?

810
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,868
In spite of the fact that most of these rats fork up

811
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,746
$50 for the powder room Iike IittIe doIIs,

812
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:31,002
I find I have again by actuaI count $9 Iess in the oId bank account

813
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,837
than I had six months ago.

814
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,590
So, my darIing Fred ,

815
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,677
I have tonight made a very serious decision .

816
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,095
And what is that?

817
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:45,391
No Ionger wiII I pIay the fieId .

818
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,019
-CongratuIations. -The fieId stinks,

819
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,521
both economicaIIy and sociaIIy.

820
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,190
And I'm giving it up.

821
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,611
Miss GoIightIy, this time I'm not onIy caIIing the poIice,

822
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,906
but the fire department and the New York State Housing Commission ,

823
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,409
and , if necessary, the Board of HeaIth !

824
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,370
Quiet up there. You want to wake the whoIe house?

825
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:12,209
As Miss GoIightIy was saying before she was so rudeIy interrupted ,

826
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,547
Miss GoIightIy further announces her intention

827
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,759
to devote her many considerabIe taIents

828
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:23,220
to the immediate capture, for the purpose of matrimony

829
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,390
of Mr Rutherford .

830
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:31,437
Rusty to his friends, of whom I'm sure he has many.

831
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,440
-TrawIer. -Who?

832
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:39,612
Rusty TrawIer. You met him at my party a coupIe of weeks ago.

833
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,822
He came with Mag WiIdwood .

834
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,617
Not the beautifuI Latin type.

835
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,244
The other one, the one that Iooks Iike a pig .

836
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,789
Remember?

837
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,626
The ninth-richest man in America under 50?

838
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,092
Do I detect a Iook of disapprovaI in your eye?

839
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,597
Tough beans, buddy, 'cause that's the way it's gonna be.

840
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,307
H i , cat.

841
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,476
HoIIy, you're drunk.

842
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,603
True.

843
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,608
-AbsoIuteIy true. True, but irreIevant. -What are you doing?

844
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,903
So I think we shouId have a drink

845
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,781
to the new Mrs Rusty TrawIer.

846
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,367
-Me. -Hey, take it easy.

847
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,538
What's the matter, don't you think I can do it?

848
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,750
TeII me. SeriousIy, I'm interested . Don't you think I can?

849
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,293
You heard the Doc.

850
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,504
My brother gets out of the army in February

851
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,715
and the Doc won't take him back. So it's aII up to me.

852
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,677
I don't know why you don't understand .

853
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,306
I need money, and I'II do whatever I have to do to get it.

854
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,308
So,

855
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:56,147
this time next month , I'II be the new Mrs Rusty TrawIer.

856
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,026
And I think we shouId have a IittIe drink to that.

857
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,363
It's aII gone. Isn't that too bad?

858
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,034
Got any whisky upstairs?

859
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,914
-But you've had enough . -Go ahead . Get the whisky.

860
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,667
I'II pay you for it.

861
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,840
-HoIIy, pIease. -No, no, you disapprove of me

862
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,760
and I do not accept drinks from gentIemen who disapprove of me.

863
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,681
I'II pay for my own whisky and don't you forget it.

864
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,891
HoIIy.

865
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,186
I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentIemen .

866
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,732
EspeciaIIy not disapproving gentIemen who are kept by other Iadies.

867
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,692
So take it.

868
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:46,113
You shouId be used to taking money from Iadies by now.

869
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,955
If I were you , I'd be more carefuI with my money.

870
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,209
Rusty TrawIer is too hard a way of earning it.

871
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:06,133
It shouId take you exactIy four seconds to cross from here to that door.

872
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,928
I'II give you two.

873
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,171
H i .

874
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,716
I've come up to taIk to you about the other night,

875
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,676
then I saw the paper, and . . .

876
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:35,139
WeII , actuaIIy, I'm kind of embarrassed about it,

877
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,727
but since it concerns you , I thought I ought to taIk to you about it in person .

878
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,563
What?

879
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,317
The earpIugs.

880
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,111
I can't go through the whoIe thing again .

881
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,780
It's sufficient to say, I've come to make up.

882
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,825
And as an added inducement, I have aII kinds of news.

883
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,160
Can I come in?

884
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:01,248
I guess so. Just a minute. Do I have a nightgown on?

885
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,793
No, I don't. WouId you mind turning around for a second?

886
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,379
Oh , never mind . It's such a corny Iine anyway.

887
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,173
I'II turn around myseIf.

888
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,549
Come in .

889
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,428
Have you seen the paper?

890
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,098
Rusty, you mean?

891
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,517
Yes. I know aII about it.

892
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,937
CertainIy had him pegged wrong , didn't I?

893
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,942
I thought he was just a rat, but he was a super-rat aII aIong .

894
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,029
A super-rat in rat's cIothing .

895
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,698
You don't even know the best part.

896
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,618
Not onIy was he a rat, or a super-rat, rather,

897
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,495
he was aIso broke.

898
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:43,207
Broke. I mean , but not a farthing .

899
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,294
H is famiIy has money, of course, but he personaIIy is broke.

900
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,714
It turns out he owes $700, 000.

901
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,468
Can you imagine anyone owing $700, 000?

902
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,804
$43, yes.

903
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,809
Anyway, that's why he decided to marry the queen of the pig peopIe.

904
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,729
I'II teII you one thing , Fred , darIing ,

905
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,482
I'd marry you for your money in a minute.

906
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,735
-WouId you marry me for my money? -In a minute.

907
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:16,323
So I guess it's pretty Iucky neither of us is rich , huh?

908
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,616
Yeah .

909
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,995
Fred , darIing , I'm so gIad to see you .

910
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,002
What have you been doing?

911
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,089
Writing , mostIy.

912
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,136
SoId a story. Just got word this morning .

913
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,848
Oh , that's marveIIous. It reaIIy is.

914
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,475
But. . .

915
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,644
OnIy how does your decorator friend feeI about it?

916
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,939
I thought you were supposed to be saving yourseIf and aII of that?

917
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,357
You know something?

918
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,193
I haven't got around to teIIing her about it yet.

919
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,612
Look, why don't we go out and have a drink

920
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,531
or take a waIk or something to ceIebrate?

921
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,699
AII right.

922
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,868
I think there's some champagne in the icebox.

923
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,703
Why don't you open it whiIe I get dressed?

924
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,829
Okay.

925
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:08,292
I don't think I've ever drunk champagne before breakfast before.

926
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,670
With breakfast on severaI occasions.

927
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,589
But never before, before.

928
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,841
Now I've got a wonderfuI idea.

929
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,385
We can spend a whoIe day doing things we've never done before.

930
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,930
We'II take turns. First something you've never done, then me.

931
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,726
Of course, I can't reaIIy think of anything I've never done.

932
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,578
I've never been for a waIk in the morning before.

933
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,705
At Ieast not since I've been in New York.

934
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,290
I've waIked up Fifth Avenue at 6: 00,

935
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,250
but as far as I'm concerned , that's stiII night.

936
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,587
-Do you think it counts? -Sure it counts. Now we're even .

937
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,853
-Don't you just Iove it? -Love what?

938
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,480
Tiffany's.

939
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,575
Isn't it wonderfuI?

940
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,078
You see what I mean how nothing bad couId ever happen to you

941
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,287
in a pIace Iike this?

942
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:31,166
It isn't that I give a hoot about jeweIIery, except diamonds, of course.

943
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,627
Like that.

944
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,593
What do you think?

945
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,470
WeII . . .

946
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:49,852
Of course, personaIIy, I think it wouId be tacky to wear diamonds before I'm 40.

947
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,272
WeII , you're right. But in the meantime, you shouId have something .

948
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,773
I'II wait.

949
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,067
No. I'm gonna buy you a present.

950
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,028
You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon , and it brought me Iuck.

951
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,197
AII right, but Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.

952
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:04,825
I've got my cheque and $ 1 0.

953
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,202
Oh , I wouIdn't Iet you cash your cheque.

954
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,706
But a present for $ 1 0 or under, that I'II accept.

955
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,335
Of course, I don't exactIy know what we're going to find at Tiffany's for $ 1 0.

956
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,388
May I heIp you?

957
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:29,766
Perhaps. ActuaIIy, we were Iooking for a present for the Iady.

958
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,018
CertainIy, sir.

959
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,562
Is there something speciaI you had in mind?

960
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,481
WeII , we had considered diamonds.

961
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,442
Now, I don't want to offend you ,

962
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,361
but the Iady feeIs that diamonds are tacky for her.

963
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,407
Oh , I think they're divine on oIder women ,

964
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,910
but I don't think they'd be right for me. You do understand?

965
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,036
CertainIy.

966
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,498
In aII fairness, I think I ought to expIain . There's aIso a secondary probIem .

967
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,666
One of finance.

968
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:58,128
We can onIy afford to spend a Iimited amount.

969
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,506
-May I ask how Iimited? -$ 1 0.

970
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,217
$ 1 0?

971
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,054
That was the outside figure, yes.

972
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,430
I see.

973
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,766
Do you have anything for $ 1 0?

974
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,935
WeII , frankIy, madam , within that price range,

975
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,812
the variety of merchandise is rather Iimited .

976
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,815
However, I do think we might have, Iet me see. . .

977
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,610
StrictIy as a noveIty, you understand .

978
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,488
For the Iady and gentIeman who has everything ,

979
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,449
a sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIer

980
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,619
at $6.75, incIuding tax.

981
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,246
A sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIer.

982
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,250
Yes, sir. At $6.75, incIuding federaI tax.

983
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,545
WeII , the price is right, but I must say,

984
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,424
I'd rather hoped for something sIightIy more, how shaII I say it,

985
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,259
romantic in feeIing .

986
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,886
What do you think?

987
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,013
As sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIers go,

988
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:53,642
I certainIy think it's handsome, but, weII , you do understand?

989
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,728
WeII , we tried , but I guess. . .

990
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,648
We couId have something engraved , couIdn't we?

991
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,149
Yes, I suppose so.

992
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,734
Yes, indeed .

993
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,446
The onIy probIem is, you wouId more or Iess have to buy something first

994
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,575
if onIy in order to have some object upon which to pIace the engraving .

995
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,911
You see the difficuIty.

996
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,579
WeII . . .

997
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,040
We couId have this engraved , couIdn't we?

998
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,126
I think it wouId be very smart.

999
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:23,797
This, I take it, was not purchased at Tiffany's?

1000
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,965
No.

1001
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,801
ActuaIIy, it was purchased concurrent with . . .

1002
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,512
WeII , actuaIIy, it came inside of. . .

1003
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,432
weII , a box of Cracker Jack.

1004
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,891
I see.

1005
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,980
Do they stiII reaIIy have prizes in Cracker Jack boxes?

1006
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,399
-Oh , yes. -That's nice to know.

1007
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,695
It gives one a feeIing of soIidarity,

1008
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,365
aImost of continuity with the past, that sort of thing .

1009
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,826
Do you think Tiffany's wouId reaIIy engrave it for us?

1010
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,786
I mean , you don't think they wouId feeI it was beneath them

1011
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,038
or anything Iike that?

1012
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,248
WeII , it is rather unusuaI , madam .

1013
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,335
But I think you'II find that Tiffany's is very understanding .

1014
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,421
If you wouId teII me what initiaIs you wouId Iike,

1015
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,883
I think we couId have something ready for you in the morning .

1016
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,512
Didn't I teII you this was a IoveIy pIace?

1017
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,119
What is this pIace, anyway?

1018
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:39,039
You said you wanted to sit down . It's the pubIic Iibrary.

1019
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,375
-You've never been here? -No. That makes two for me.

1020
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,378
-I don't see any books. -They're in there.

1021
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,343
See?

1022
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,518
Each one of these IittIe drawers is stuffed with IittIe cards.

1023
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,813
And each IittIe card is a book or an author.

1024
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,689
I think that's fascinating .

1025
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,359
V-A-R-J-A-K.

1026
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,819
ReaIIy?

1027
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,282
Look. Isn't it marveIIous?

1028
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:17,202
There you are, right in the pubIic Iibrary.

1029
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:20,163
"Varjak, PauI . Nine Lives. "

1030
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,290
And then a Iot of numbers.

1031
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,960
Do you think they reaIIy have the book itseIf, Iive?

1032
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,129
Sure. FoIIow me.

1033
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,974
N umber 57. That's us.

1034
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,145
Fifty-seven , pIease. Nine Lives by Varjak, PauI .

1035
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,106
Did you ever read it? It's absoIuteIy marveIIous.

1036
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,568
-No, I'm afraid I haven't. -WeII , you shouId . He wrote it.

1037
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,987
He's Varjak, PauI , in person .

1038
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,364
She doesn't beIieve me.

1039
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:58,368
Show her your driver's Iicence or Diner's CIub card or something .

1040
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,913
Honest, he reaIIy is the author. Cross my heart and kiss my eIbow.

1041
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,082
WouId you kindIy Iower your voice, miss?

1042
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,876
Why don't you autograph it to them?

1043
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,378
Don't you think it'd be nice? Sort of make it more personaI?

1044
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,838
ReaIIy, miss. . .

1045
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,133
Go ahead . Don't be so stuck up, autograph it to them .

1046
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,051
AII right, what shaII I say?

1047
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,679
Something sentimentaI , I think.

1048
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,348
What are you doing? Stop that!

1049
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:24,477
-You're defacing pubIic property. -WeII , aII right, if that's the way you feeI .

1050
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,813
Come on , Fred , darIing . Let's get out of here.

1051
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:29,649
I don't think this pIace is haIf as nice as Tiffany's.

1052
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,333
Hey, did you ever steaI anything from a five-and-ten

1053
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,834
when you were a kid , I mean?

1054
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,504
No. I'm the sensitive, bookish type. Did you?

1055
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:55,508
I used to. I stiII do every now and then , sort of to keep my hand in .

1056
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,344
Come on . Don't be chicken .

1057
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:00,263
Anyway, you've never done it, and it's your turn .

1058
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,267
I can't see.

1059
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,528
H i , cat.

1060
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,739
Lady of the house at home?

1061
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:33,244
HoIIy?

1062
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,356
Trick or treat.

1063
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,694
You're crazy. You know that, don't you? But I Iove you anyway.

1064
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,072
-2-E. -Yeah?

1065
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,742
I've got to taIk to you .

1066
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:14,869
AII right.

1067
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,376
You want a drink?

1068
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,842
If this is going to be a serious discussion

1069
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,428
and suddenIy I'm terribIy afraid it is,

1070
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,598
you're going to have to take off that ridicuIous mask

1071
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,226
or eIse I'm going to have to wear one, too.

1072
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,937
2-E, Iook, pIease.

1073
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,487
What's the matter? GirI troubIe?

1074
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,615
Is that it, darIing?

1075
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,286
Oh , I see.

1076
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,790
WeII , that's not so serious.

1077
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,002
As a matter of fact, I've been expecting it.

1078
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,963
I can't say I Iike it, but I've been expecting it.

1079
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,301
-Who is she? -Hasn't got anything to do with her.

1080
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,139
This is between you and me.

1081
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,141
Then it is serious.

1082
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:20,810
WeII , now.

1083
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,979
2-E, you're a very styIish girI .

1084
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,274
Can't we end this styIishIy?

1085
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,320
-End it? -Yes.

1086
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,489
WeII . . .

1087
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,830
I do beIieve Iove has found Andy Hardy.

1088
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,333
Let's see,

1089
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:44,792
a waitress?

1090
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:46,794
A saIesgirI?

1091
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:50,340
No. She'd have to be someone rich , wouIdn't she, PauI?

1092
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,676
Someone who couId heIp you .

1093
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,845
CuriousIy enough ,

1094
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,143
she's a girI who can't heIp anyone, not even herseIf.

1095
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:07,357
Thing is, I can heIp her, and it's a nice feeIing for a change.

1096
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,194
AII right.

1097
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,238
I understand .

1098
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,327
I'II teII you what, PauI .

1099
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,163
I am a very styIish girI .

1100
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,874
-What are you doing? -Writing a cheque.

1101
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,587
Don't Iook so bewiIdered .

1102
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,382
SureIy you've noticed me writing cheques before.

1103
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:36,052
"Pay to the order of PauI Varjak, $ 1 , 000."

1104
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,389
Take her away somewhere for a week.

1105
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,601
You're entitIed to a vacation with pay.

1106
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,688
SimpIy a matter of fair Iabour practise, darIing .

1107
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,106
Of course, if you were reaIIy smart,

1108
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:51,025
you'd get some of the other boys together and organise a union .

1109
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,736
That way you'd get aII the fringe benefits,

1110
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:56,239
hospitaIisation , a pension pIan

1111
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,117
and unempIoyment insurance when you're,

1112
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,246
how shaII I put it, between engagements?

1113
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,669
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1114
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,797
Don't be ridicuIous, darIing .

1115
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,924
Take the cheque.

1116
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,801
And caII your girI .

1117
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,177
No, thanks.

1118
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,097
I've got a cheque of my own .

1119
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,852
When you get yourseIf a new writer to heIp,

1120
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,187
try and find one my size.

1121
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,983
That way you won't have to even shorten the sIeeves.

1122
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:32,001
HoIIy!

1123
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:35,129
Hey.

1124
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,215
-What are you doing? -Excuse me.

1125
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,092

1126
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,887
You Iook just Iike a girI I know named HoIIy.

1127
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,013
ReaIIy?

1128
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,183
I'm sorry.

1129
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,713

-What are you doing? -Reading .

1134
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,946
"South America: Land of Wealth and Promise"?

1135
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,782
It's very interesting .

1136
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:48,244
Let's get out of here.

1137
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:53,082
I said Iet's get out of here. I want to taIk to you .

1138

01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,903
-What's the matter with you , anyway? -Let me go.

1144
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,863
-No. -Fred , pIease Iet me go.

1145
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,281

-Let me go. -Not tiII we get this settIed .

1150
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,460
Now what's aII this jazz about South America?

1151
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,296
I thought if I'm going to marry a South American ,

1152
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,840
I'd better find out something about the country.

1153
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:45,718
-Marry? What South American? -José.

1154
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,471
-Who the heII is José? -José da SiIva Pereira.

1155
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,264
Who the heII's José da SiIva Pereira?

1156
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,351
DarIing , you met him . I know you did . Mag WiIdwood's friend .

1157
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,312
The taII , good-Iooking one who came to the party with Rusty?

1158
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,189
WeII , my dear, you won't beIieve this,

1159
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,567
but it turns out not onIy is he handsome and wiIdIy rich ,

1160
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,569
he's absoIuteIy cuckoo for me.

1161
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,864
-You're crazy. -What? Do you think you own me?

1162
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,366
That's exactIy what I think.

1163
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,159
I know, I know. That's what everybody aIways thinks,

1164
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,702
but everybody happens to be wrong .

1165
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:13,496
Look, I am not everybody.

1166
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,166
Or am I?

1167
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,170
Is that what you reaIIy think?

1168
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:25,883
That I'm no different from aII your other rats and super-rats?

1169
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,177
Wait a minute.

1170
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,346
If that's it,

1171
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,266
if that's what you reaIIy think,

1172

1173

I wouIdn't ask you in , except the pIace is in such a mess

1176
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,024
-I couIdn't bear to face it aIone. -You have a message.

1177
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:24,316
No.

1178
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,113
Olé.

-What did you do to her? -Nothing .

1193
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,691
There was a teIegram , and then this.

1194
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:32,027
Crashing everything , conducting Iike a crazy. It's appaIIing .

1195
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:35,197
I can't have a pubIic scandaI . It's too deIicate.

WiII there be the poIice again , do you think?

1198
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:42,955
I don't see why. There's no Iaw against busting up your own apartment.

1199
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,207
-Where is the teIegram? -There it is.

1200
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,342
"Received notice. Young Fred kiIIed

This brother, was she very cIose to him?

01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,075
Yeah .

1207

What can one do?

1208
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,541
Try to heIp her.

1209

I tried . It didn't do much good .

1210
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,423
You got a ranch or something down in BraziI , don't you?

1211
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,549
Yes.

Got your wire. How did you know where to reach me?

1216
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,611
Oh , I tried everything . CaIIed peopIe, asked around

1217
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:21,488
and suddenIy thought of Iooking in the phone book.

Anyway, I'm gIad you couId come.

-You Iook fine. -You think so?

1220
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,581
I'm fat as a pig , and I haven't had my hair done in months.

1221
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,625
But I'm happy, reaIIy happy. It probabIy shows.

1222
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,295
You Iook très distingué yourseIf.

1223
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,172

1225
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,385
Two in The New Yorker and one in that funny IittIe magazine.

1226
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,598
Won't you sit down?

-I've taken up knitting . -So I see.

1229

It'II probabIy Iook very nice once it's finished .

1230
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,817
ActuaIIy, I'm a IittIe nervous about it.

1231
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:01,820
José brought up the bIueprints for a new ranch house he's buiIding

1232
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:02,946
and I have this strange feeIing

1233
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,657
that maybe the bIueprints and my knitting instructions got switched .

1234
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:09,036
I mean , it isn't impossibIe that I'm knitting a ranch house.

1235
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:21,465
ReaIIy, darIing , I can't teII you how divineIy happy I am .

1236
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,468
What is that, anyhow?

1237
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,471
Portuguese. A very compIicated Ianguage.

1238
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,640
Four thousand irreguIar verbs.

1239
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,315
Very impressive. What's it mean?

1240
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,110
"I beIieve you are in Ieague with the butcher."

1241
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,740
HoIIy, what's this about?

1242
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,285
Why did you want to see me?

1243
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:52,788
José's in Washington for the night

1244
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,541
so I thought if I asked you over, you might come.

1245
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,002
And , weII , I've said goodbye to everyone eIse I care about.

1246
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,504
You're going somewhere?

1247
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:01,922
I'm going to Rio tomorrow.

1248
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,800
I've got the pIane ticket, and I've even said goodbye to oId SaIIy.

1249
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,135
José is fIying down with you?

1250
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,011
We're going on separate pIanes, of course.

1251
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,806
He doesn't think it wouId Iook right for us to be traveIIing together.

1252
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,391
H is famiIy's very important down there,

1253
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,476
so he has to worry about things Iike that.

1254
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:17,187
Anyway, I thought I'd show off and cook dinner for us.

1255
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,856
It'II be fun eating in .

1256
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,192
Did I teII you how divineIy and utterIy happy I am?

1257
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,402
Yes.

1258
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,904
You are getting married , then?

1259
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,658
WeII , he hasn't reaIIy asked me, not in so many words.

1260
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:30,993
Four, you mean?

1261
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:35,164
WeII , that's how many words it takes.

1262
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,499
"WiII you marry me?"

1263
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,669
Oh , we'II get married , aII right. I know we wiII .

1264
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:43,755
And in church and with his famiIy there and everything .

1265
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,009
And that's why he's waiting tiII we get to Rio, probabIy.

1266
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,514
Do you think it's trying to teII us something?

1267
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:56,518
I hope you Iike chicken and saffron rice served with chocoIate sauce.

1268
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,437
It's an East Indian cIassic, my dear.

1269
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,023
Three months ago, I couIdn't scrambIe eggs.

1270
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:06,111
Are you aII right?

1271
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:10,365
GoIIy, darIing . I did so want to impress you .

1272
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,533
Look,

1273
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,786
I'm not much for chicken with sauce, anyway.

1274
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:18,373
Why don't we go out somewhere? Let me buy you a fareweII dinner.

1275
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:22,127
That wouId be fun , as Iong as it's somepIace I can go Iike this.

1276
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:31,386
Years from now,

1277
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:34,389
years and years, I'II be back.

1278
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:37,392
Me and my nine BraziIian brats.

1279
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,313
They'II be dark Iike José, of course,

1280
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,233
but they'II have bright, green , beautifuI eyes.

1281
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:50,364
I'II bring them back, aII right, 'cause they must see this.

1282
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,242
Oh , I Iove New York.

1283
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:56,537
Then why are you Ieaving? What's in it for you , anyway?

1284
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,916
Look, I know what you're thinking , and I don't bIame you .

1285
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,752
I've aIways thrown out such a jazzy Iine.

1286
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:08,674
ReaIIy, except for Doc and yourseIf, José's my first non-rat romance.

1287
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:12,427
Not that he's my idea of the absoIute finito.

1288
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:15,931
He's too prim and cautious to be my absoIute ideaI .

1289
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:20,602
Now if I couId choose from anybody aIive, I wouIdn't pick José.

1290
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,854
Nehru , maybe, or AIbert Schweitzer.

1291
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,274
Or Leonard Bernstein .

1292
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,361
But I am mad about José.

1293
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:32,281
I honestIy think I'd give up smoking if he asked me.

1294
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:38,120
Come on , darIing , Iet's eat. It's getting Iate.

1295
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:42,958
I'm Ieaving tomorrow, and I haven't even begun to pack.

1296
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:07,399
Didn't want José to think I was the kind of girI who Ioses her key,

1297
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,276
so I had 26 of them made.

1298
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:11,987
No, wait. I got a better idea.

1299
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,822
Kind of a fareweII gesture.

1300
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,326
Somebody must have tripped the Iock.

1301
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,995
Crafty deviI , that Yunioshi .

1302
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,497
Wake up, wake up ! The British are coming !

1303
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,750
-Or, in this case, the BraziIians. -ExactIy.

1304
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:27,753
-ExactIy. -I've stiII got to cIean up aII that rice.

1305
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:30,631
Hey, you know. . .

1306
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:31,840
Hey!

1307
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:37,304
There she are who did it! The wanted woman ! There !

1308
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:40,766
Groenburger. Narcotics squad .

1309
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,685
-What do you mean? -What's going on?

1310
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,437
-Why don't you ask your boss? -What boss?

1311
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,106
SaIIy Tomato. Why don't you ask him? Come on .

1312
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:52,152
Look around for narcotic. They got pIenty narcotic in there.

1313
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,048
-What's your name? -Varjak.

1314
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,466
HoId it down over there !

1315
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,302
PauI Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1316
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:19,221
-Hey! -Oh , get Iost, wiII you?

1317
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:20,389
Get out!

1318
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,224
I'm a writer.

1319
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,685
W-R-I-T-E-R.

1320
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:32,984
-PIease. One, one, pIease. -One at a time. PIease, one.

1321
01:40:33,403 --> 01:40:34,569
Good .

1322
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:38,490
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute. -I can't answer aII your questions.

1323
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:41,076
-Just one at a time. -Knock it off!

1324
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,788
Now, darIing , why don't you start?

1325
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,957
Is it true you carried messages from Tomato in code?

1326
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,166
Of course not.

1327
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,293
I'd just meet Mr O'Shaughnessy at Hamburger Heaven

1328
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,503
and give him the weather report.

1329
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:54,089
SimpIy do not ask me what this is aII about.

1330
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:56,800
But you did used to visit Tomato?

1331
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:58,844
I used to see him every week. What's wrong with that?

1332
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:01,179
WeII , you must've known Tomato was part of the narcotics syndicate.

1333
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:02,848
Mr Tomato never mentioned narcotics to me.

1334
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,851
It makes me furious the way aII these wretched peopIe keep persecuting him .

1335
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,936
He's a deepIy sensitive person .

1336
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,480
-A darIing oId man . -Then you're innocent.

1337
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:12,524
-Of course I'm innocent. -What are you going to do about it?

1338
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,152
-What do you mean? -WeII , who's your Iawyer?

1339
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,611
I don't know.

1340
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,989
Mr O'Shaughnessy, I guess.

1341
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:21,783
Mr O'Shaughnessy!

1342
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,162
Hey! Get out of here !

1343
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,622
-AII right, come on . -Okay, move.

1344
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,083
-Come on , then . -Mr O'Shaughnessy?

1345
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:32,335
-Shut up ! -Get in there.

1346
01:41:54,484 --> 01:41:56,693
-Yeah . -Mr Paul Varjak?

1347
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:59,654
-Yeah . -Ready with Mr Berman in Hollywood.

1348
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:03,825
Kindly deposit $3 for the first 3 minutes, please.

1349
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,171
Hello?

1350
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,507
O.J . Berman here. Who's caIIing?

1351
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:23,011
-Mr Berman , this is PauI Varjak. -N ice to taIk to you , kid .

1352
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:26,515
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1353
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,893
I'm a friend of HoIIy's. I met you at a party in New York.

1354
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:33,980
-Who? -Paul. Paul Varjak.

1355
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,524
V-A-R. . .

1356
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:39,528
Mr Berman , this is Fred .

1357
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,571
Oh , Fred baby, huh?

1358
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,907
So you're calling about the kid, huh?

1359
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:47,536
Everything's under controI . Just reIax.

1360
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:51,081
I spoke to my Iawyer in New York.

1361
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,917
I toId him to take care of everything , send me the biII

1362
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:55,418
but to keep my name anonymous.

1363
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:58,380
-What? -Unknown. l don't want any part of it.

1364
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,925
-You hear me? -You sound Iike you're in a tunneI .

1365
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,178
It's this executive phone I have.

1366
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:07,264
-what? -Executive phone !

1367
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:10,767
Fred baby, they onIy got her on $ 1 0, 000 baiI .

1368
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:15,063
My Iawyer can get her out at 1 0: 00 this morning . I'II teII you what you do.

1369
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,899
You bust into that dump she Iives in ,

1370
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,860
coIIect aII her junk.

1371
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:21,736
Go down to the jaiI . Get her out.

1372
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:25,073
Take her straight over to a hoteI under a phoney name, right?

1373
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,784
You wanna keep away from the reporters as much as possibIe.

1374
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,661
Do you know what I mean? WiII you do that?

1375
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,121
Sure, Mr Berman .

1376
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,624
-I can't teII you how much I appreciate. . . -Forget it.

1377
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:37,043
I owe her something .

1378
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:42,549
Not that I owe her anything , I mean , if you reaIIy get right down to it,

1379
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,385
but she's a crazy.

1380
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,097
She's a phoney.

1381
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:52,434
But she's a reaI phoney.

1382
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,605
-Know what I mean , kid? -Yeah , I know what you mean .

1383
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,275
-Thanks, Mr Berman . Thanks a Iot. -Right!

1384
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,743
Why don't you behave?

1385
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:23,632
Quel night.

1386
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:40,482
I did a IittIe housebreaking whiIe you were away.

1387
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,443
CIayton HoteI , driver. 84th and Madison .

1388
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:48,615
O.J . thinks it'd be a good idea if you stayed out of sight for a whiIe.

1389
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:52,452
I got most of your stuff here, incIuding cat. Hope he's aII right.

1390
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,162
Yeah .

1391
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,455
HeIIo, cat.

1392
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,499
Poor no-name sIob.

1393
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,671
Listen , darIing . Did you find that pIane ticket?

1394
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:06,174
-Right here. We can cash it in . -Cash it in? Are you kidding?

1395
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:08,009
What time is it?

1396
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:10,220
-A IittIe after 1 0: 00. -Good .

1397
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,597
IdIewiId Airport, pIease, driver.

1398
01:45:12,682 --> 01:45:15,350
-Never mind . You can't do that. -Why not?

1399
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:18,061
You don't understand . You're under indictment.

1400
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,231
If they catch you jumping baiI , they'II Iock you up and throw away the key.

1401
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:22,899
Don't be ridicuIous, darIing .

1402
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,067
By the day after tomorrow,

1403
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,277
I'II be married to the future president of BraziI .

1404
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:29,364
And that'II give me dipIomatic immunity or something .

1405
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,450
I wouIdn't bet on it.

1406
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,078
What is it, darIing?

1407
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:39,541
Message for you .

1408
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,210
Oh , yes, I see.

1409
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:45,005
Did he bring it in person , or was it,

1410
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,465
just there, shoved under the door?

1411
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,800
A cousin .

1412
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:54,055
Hand me my purse, wiII you , darIing?

1413
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,600
A girI can't read that sort of thing without her Iipstick.

1414
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,313
You read it to me, wiII you , darIing?

1415
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:04,649
I don't think I can quite bear. . .

1416
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,235
Sure you want me to?

1417
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:12,240
Okay.

1418
01:46:13,743 --> 01:46:15,452
"My dearest IittIe girI ,

1419
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:19,122
"I have Ioved you knowing you were not as others.

1420
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,790
"But conceive of my despair

1421
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:23,960
"upon discovering in such a brutaI and pubIic styIe

1422
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:27,672
"how very different you are from the manner of woman

1423
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:30,592
"a man of my position couId hope to make his wife.

1424
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,097
"I grieve for the disgrace of your present circumstances.

1425
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,141
"And I do not find it in my heart

1426
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,143
"to add my condemn

1427
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,771
"to the condemn that surrounds you .

1428
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,776
"So I hope you wiII find it in your heart not to condemn me.

1429
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:50,945
"I have my famiIy to protect and my name

1430
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:55,200
"and I am a coward where these institutions enter.

1431
01:46:56,494 --> 01:47:00,830
"Forget me, beautifuI chiId . And may God be with you .

1432
01:47:01,123 --> 01:47:02,332
"José."

1433
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:05,835
WeII?

1434
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:10,048
WeII , at Ieast he's honest.

1435
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:13,051
-It's kind of touching . -Touching?

1436
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,886
That square-baII jazz.

1437
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:18,139
He says he's a coward .

1438
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:22,143
AII right. So he's not a reguIar rat or even a super-rat.

1439
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:24,729
He's just a scared IittIe mouse, that's aII .

1440
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:27,524
But, oh , goIIy.

1441
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:29,692
Gee, damn .

1442
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:38,034
WeII , so much for South America.

1443
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,915
I didn't reaIIy think you were cut out to be queen of the Pampas, anyway.

1444
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,668
-CIayton HoteI . -IdIewiId .

1445
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:48,503
What?

1446
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:51,756
The pIane Ieaves at 1 2: 00. And on it I pIan to be.

1447
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:53,216
HoIIy, you can't.

1448
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:59,889
I'm not hotfooting it after José, if that's what you think. Oh , no.

1449
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:03,518
As far as I'm concerned , he's the future president of nowhere.

1450
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:05,937
OnIy why shouId I waste a perfectIy good pIane ticket?

1451
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:08,189
Besides, I've never been to BraziI .

1452
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,361
PIease, darIing , don't sit there Iooking at me Iike that.

1453
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,072
I'm going and that's aII there is to it.

1454
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:18,616
Now aII they want from me

1455
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,411
are my services as the state's witness against SaIIy.

1456
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:24,289
Nobody has any intention of prosecuting me.

1457
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:27,250
To begin with , they don't have a ghost of a chance.

1458
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:30,962
Even so, this town's finished for me.

1459
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,547
At Ieast for a whiIe.

1460
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:37,886
There are certain shades of IimeIight that can wreck a girI's compIexion .

1461
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,763
They'II have the rope up at every saIoon in town .

1462
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,641
I'II teII you what you do for me, darIing .

1463
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:44,893
When you get back to town ,

1464
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:48,104
I want you to caII up the New York Times or whoever you caII .

1465
01:48:48,189 --> 01:48:51,566
I want you to maiI me a Iist of the 50 richest men in BraziI .

1466
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:52,942
The 50 richest.

1467
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:59,282
-HoIIy, I'm not going to Iet you do this. -You're not going to Iet me?

1468
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:01,492
HoIIy, I'm in Iove with you .

1469
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,703
-So what? -So what?

1470
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:05,788
So pIenty.

1471
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,250
-I Iove you . You beIong to me. -No.

1472
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,045
-PeopIe don't beIong to peopIe. -Of course they do.

1473
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:14,005
I'm not gonna Iet anyone put me in a cage.

1474
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:16,341
I don't want to put you in a cage. I want to Iove you .

1475
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:18,843
-It's the same thing . -No, it's not.

1476
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,720
-HoIIy. . . -I'm not HoIIy.

1477
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,097
I'm not LuIa Mae, either. I don't know who I am .

1478
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,390
I'm Iike cat, here.

1479
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,809
We're a coupIe of no-name sIobs. We beIong to nobody.

1480
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:30,230
And nobody beIongs to us. We don't even beIong to each other.

1481
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:32,440
Stop the cab.

1482
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:40,031
What do you think?

1483
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:43,284
This ought to be the right kind of pIace for a tough guy Iike you .

1484
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,703
Garbage cans, rats gaIore.

1485
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:46,829
Scram !

1486
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,707
I said take off! Beat it!

1487
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,209
Let's go.

1488
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:04,597
Driver

1489
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,893
puII over here.

1490
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:20,863
You know what's wrong with you , Miss Whoever-you-are?

1491
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,908
You're chicken . You've got no guts.

1492
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:27,078
You're afraid to stick out your chin and say, "Okay, Iife's a fact."

1493
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,621
PeopIe do faII in Iove.

1494
01:50:28,706 --> 01:50:30,581
PeopIe do beIong to each other

1495
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:33,960
because that's the onIy chance anybody's got for reaI happiness.

1496
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,297
You caII yourseIf a free spirit, a wiId thing .

1497
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,717
And you're terrified somebody's going to stick you in a cage.

1498
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:44,637
WeII , baby, you're aIready in that cage. You buiIt it yourseIf.

1499
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,806
And it's not bounded in the west by TuIip, Texas

1500
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,308
or in the east by SomaIiIand .

1501
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,851
It's wherever you go.

1502
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:53,896
Because no matter where you run , you just end up running into yourseIf.

1503
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,699
Here. I've been carrying this thing around for months.

1504
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:06,993
I don't want it any more.

1505
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,255
Here, cat!

1506
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:03,132
Cat!

1507
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,227
Where's the cat?

1508
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,896
I don't know.

1509
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:45,550
Cat!

1510
01:52:50,472 --> 01:53:27,508
Cat.
