2
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,869
有人说魔法的力量…
It has been said that magic vanished from our world

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,660
早就从世界上消失
a long time ago,

4
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,700
人类也无法利用许愿的力量…
and that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires

5
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,830
一偿宿愿
through the power of wishes.

6
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:49,000
如果你早已失去童年奇妙的想象力
To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes,

7
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,886
在此为你献上一个小男孩的故事
submitted here is the story of a little boy

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,347
他的圣诞节愿望…
and a magical Christmas wish

9
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,892
神奇地改变了他的一生
that changed his life forever.

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,733
故事发生在1985年
地点是波士顿市郊
lt began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:12,280
圣诞节前夕…
每个小孩都兴高采烈
It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits.

12
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,440
每年也只有这个日子…
That special time of year

13
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,780
波士顿的小孩会集合起来…
when Boston children gather together

14
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,704
痛扁犹太小孩
and beat up the Jewish kids.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,997
格林宝！
Hey, Greenbaum!

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,958
明天是耶稣的生日
It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow,

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,501
知道我要送他什么吗
and you know what I'm gonna get him?

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,669
什么
What?

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,713
捶过你矬脸的我的拳
My fist in your fucking face!

20
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,673
耶稣怎么喜欢这个
Why would Jesus want that?

21
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:31,790
抓住他
Get him!

22
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,583
可是有一个男孩没有很开心
But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits.

23
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,418
小强班奈特…
Little John Bennett,

24
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,796
每个社区都有一个像他一样…
that one boy in every neighborhood

25
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,640
永远交不到朋友的人
who just has a tough time making friends.

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
我可以跟你们玩吗？
Hey, guys, can l play?

27
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,760
走开，班奈特
Get out of here, Bennett.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,900
滚，班奈特
Get lost, Bennett!

29
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,020
滚蛋，班奈特
Get out of here, Bennett!

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,520
对！给我滚！
Yeah, Bennett, get lost.

31
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,894
强衷心盼望…
John longed with all his heart

32
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:02,330
能有一个真正属于他的朋友
for that one, true friend that he could call his own.

33
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,568
他深信如果交到这种朋友…
And he knew that if he ever found that friend,

34
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:09,446
他绝对不会放手
he would never let him go.

35
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:15,550
一如往常，又来到圣诞节的早上
Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came.

36
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:19,873
孩子在年节欢乐气氛下拆开礼物
All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee.

37
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,000
“任天堂”

38
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,258
至于小强班奈特…
And for little John Bennett,

39
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:34,070
那年的圣诞节带来了意想不到的惊喜
Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival.

40
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,853
Wow!

41
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,740
圣诞老人大概有发现你今年很乖喔
l guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh?

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,740
圣诞快乐，强
Aw! Merry Christmas, John.

43
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:47,950
我爱你！
l love you!

44
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,960
他会说话！
He talks!

45
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,710
我要叫你泰德
I'm going to name you Teddy.

46
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:59,454
强立刻就喜欢上泰德
John became instantly attached to Teddy.

47
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,999
这只熊有种特质…
There was something about that bear

48
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:05,544
让强觉得他终于找到…
that made him feel as if he finally had a friend

49
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:09,140
能够分享内心秘密的好朋友了
with whom he could share his deepest secrets.

50
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,640
我爱你！
l love you!

51
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,270
我也爱你，泰德
l love you, too, Teddy.

52
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:17,848
我好希望你能真的陪我聊天
You know, l wish you could really talk to me.

53
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:22,240
这样就能永远做我的好朋友了
Because then, we could be best friends forever and ever.

54
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:26,189
有一件事你不能否认…
Now, if there's one thing you can be sure of,

55
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,160
小孩的愿望就是最强大的力量
it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish.

56
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,739
当然除了阿帕契攻击直升机
Except an Apache helicopter.

57
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,326
因为它有机关枪，又有飞弹
An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles.

58
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:41,079
是个无法想象叹为观止的武器总汇
It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry,

59
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,260
十足的杀人凶器
an absoIute death machine.

60
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,793
我们事后才发现…
Well, as it turned out,

61
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,430
强挑了一个最完美的夜晚许愿
John picked the perfect night to make a wish.

62
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:39,980
泰德？
Teddy?

63
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,490
来抱抱吧
Hug me.

64
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,910
你是我最好的朋友，强
You're my best friend, John.

65
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,696
你…你在说话吗？
Did you. . . Did you just talk?

66
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,280
有必要那么惊讶吗？
Don't look so surprised.

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,460
明明是你许的愿，不是吗？
You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,670
对，我是有许愿
Yeah. l did wish for it.

69
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,497
所以就愿望成真啊
Well, here l am.

70
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,760
你是说我们能做最好的朋友吗？
You mean, we get to be best friends for real?

71
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,168
当然
For real.

72
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,640
永远永远吗？
Forever and ever?

73
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,220
有何不可
Sounds good to me.

74
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:18,051
强大概是世界上最开心的小孩了…
John was just about the happiest boy in the worId

75
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,770
他等不及要告诉大家这个好消息
and he couIdn't wait to tell everyone the good news.

76
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,199
今年的圣诞棒极了
Well, l think we've had a wonderful Christmas this year.

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,659
最棒之一
One of the best.

78
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,662
你昨晚的礼物尤其棒
And l particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night.

79
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,540
我们家猛男一年忙到头
Well, my big strong husband works so hard all year.

80
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,917
怎么着也得犒劳一下
l figured you deserved a little Christmas treat.

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,420
这何止是“犒劳”
l'd call it more than a little treat.

82
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,382
那些胶合板让我动得更爽
l think those veneers just make it a smoother ride for me.

83
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,134
人家疼爱你嘛
Mmm. Well, that's how much l love you.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,512
总之 你的口活儿非同凡响
Seriously though, that was an outstanding blowjob.

85
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,641
爸爸妈妈 我的泰迪熊活起来了！
Mom, Dad, guess what? My teddy bear's alive!

86
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,470
真的吗？高不高兴？
Really? Well, isn't that exciting.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,563
妈，他真的活起来了，你看
No, Mom, he's really alive. Look.

88
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
大家圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, everybody.

89
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,443
靠北！
Jesus H. Fuck!

90
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,153
大家来当好朋友吧
Let's all be best friends.

91
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,230
天哪！
Oh, my God!

92
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
强，快离开那东西，快过来
John, get away from that thing. Get over here right now.

93
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,950
可是，爸… -快过来！
But, Dad. . . Get over here!

94
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,530
听妈妈的话！过来这里！
Listen to your father! Come here!

95
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,490
海伦，拿我的枪来 -爸，不要
Helen, get my gun. Dad, no!

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,746
是抱抱枪吗？
ls it a hugging gun?

97
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,498
去拿我的枪，顺便报警！
Helen, get my gun, and call the police!

98
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,751
抱歉，班先生，我不是故意要吓人的
I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett, l didn't mean to scare anybody.

99
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,000
我只是想和强做朋友
l just wanted John and l to be friends.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,540
爸，我昨晚许愿希望泰德活起来…
Yeah, Dad, l made a wish last night that Teddy was alive

101
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,925
然后愿望成真了
and my wish came true.

102
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,380
噢，我的天
Oh, my God!

103
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,390
这是个奇迹
lt's a miracle.

104
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,810
圣诞节的奇迹
lt's a Christmas miracle.

105
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,060
你就像小耶稣一样
You're just like the Baby Jesus.

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,693
不用多久，强的小奇迹…
Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's IittIe miracIe

107
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,520
就轰动全国
was sweeping the nation.

108
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,940
波士顿市郊…
Out of a Boston suburb

109
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,820
发生一件不可思议的事情
comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story...

110
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,780
一位小男孩的玩偶…
A young boy's stuffed animal

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,490
竟然活起来了，至今原因不明
has magically come to life for, as yet, unknown reasons...

112
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,417
耶稣显灵！耶稣显灵！耶稣显灵！
Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!

113
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,892
马上，泰德变成家喻户晓的人物
Before Iong, Teddy had become a huge celebrity
in his own right.

114
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,270
你好，泰德
Hello, Teddy.

115
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,739
你真让我惊讶
You. . . You are a. . . You surprise me.

116
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,070
我还以为你很高
For some reason l thought you were going to be taller.

117
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,744
我还以为你很搞笑
l thought you were going to be funnier.

118
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,670
<i>你...
你最爱看哪个节目</i>
You... What are your favorite teIevision shows?

119
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,713
<i>中场休息吧</i>
Um, l like Gimme a Break. . .

120
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,131
爸爸 我想要泰迪熊
Dad. l want a teddy bear.

121
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,635
嘿 爸爸才给你的生日礼物呢
Hey! What did Daddy just get you for your birthday, huh?

122
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,470
-一个耙子
-不错
- A rake. - That's right.

123
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,973
一个超凡耙  你的生日耙
An excellent rake. A birthday rake.

124
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,059
打扫院子时候 你就不必用手捡树叶了
So when you clean the yard, you don't have to pick up the leaves with your hands.

125
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,228
但我想要电视上那只熊
But, Dad. l want the bear on TV.

126
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,982
唐尼 闭上你的嘴
爸爸正和你新妈妈爱爱
Donny. Shut up, will ya? Daddy's making love to New Mommy.

127
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,150
-但是爸爸...
-回吊床上去
But, Daddy? Go to your hammock!

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>你看过我们节目吗</i>
Do you ever watch this show?

129
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,655
<i>当然  莱诺当嘉宾主持时</i>
Yeah. When Leno guest hosts.

130
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,990
但尽管名气再大…
But through all the fame,

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,125
泰德也没有忘记他最好的朋友强
Teddy never forgot his very best friend, John.

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,870
雷声吓不了我们吧？
The thunder can't get us, right?

133
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,630
当然，我们是雷雷伙伴耶
雷雷懂的
Nope, we're thunder buddies, and the thunder knows it.

134
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,509
我们很安全
We're totally safe.

135
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,261
泰德？
Teddy?

136
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,595
怎么了，强？
Yeah, John?

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,348

269
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,850
她想要的不只是一顿晚餐？
maybe she's hoping for something more than dinner?

270
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,020
不然还要什么？
Like what?

271
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,234
我不晓得，但换作是我，我想要求婚
l don't know, but if it were me, l'd be expecting a proposal.

272
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,730
少来了，她才不会期待被求婚
Come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose.

273
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,280
我是说，结婚并不是…
l mean, marriage isn't. . .

274
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,992
难道有爱还不够吗？我认为够了
lsn't love enough? l submit that love is enough.

275
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:18,070
你可以拿戒指塞她屁眼
然后放屁喷出来
You can put the ring in her ass, let her fart it out.

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,913
“飞侠哥顿”

277
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,667
“山姆琼斯饰演飞侠哥顿”

278
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,839
烂片一部，但是我喜欢
So bad, but so good.

279
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,924
二元辩证真奇妙
Yeah. lt's a study in contrasts.

280
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,760
哦 这段我喜欢
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, l love this part right here.

281
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,304
<i>他属于我们大家</i>
He's for every one of us!

282
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,682
<i>他代表我们大家</i>
Stands for everyone of us!

283
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>他用强有力的双手拯救大家</i>
He'll save with a mighty hand

284
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,603
<i>男女老幼 他用强光保卫大家</i>
Every man, every woman, every child With a mighty flash!

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,855
靠 飞侠 老天啊
Yeah. Fuck, yeah. Flash! Oh, my God.

286
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,358
对了，要提醒我…
Hey, by the way, don't let me forget,

287
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,360
要敲定明晚棕熊队比赛的计划
you and l got to nail down a plan
for the Bruins game tomorrow night.

288
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,650
不行，我要带洛莉去吃饭
No, l can't. I'm taking Lori to dinner.

289
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
为什么？
For what?

290
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,699
明天是我们的四周年
Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow.

291
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,280
挖哩勒，不错喔
Oh, fuck me. Nice.

292
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,245
我问你喔
Let me ask you something.

293
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,122
她该不会觉得我要做什么大事吧？
You don't think she's going to be expecting something big, do you?

294
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,374
开她后庭花？
What, like anal?

295
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,627
不是，我是怕她以为我要求婚
No, like a fucking circular gold thing on her finger.

296
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,421
靠！你们在一起才4年
Oh, fuck that! lt's been four years, Johnny.

297
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,298
我跟你已经27年了耶
You and me have been together for 27 years.

298
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,134
我他妈的戒指呢？王八蛋！
Where's my ring? Where's my ring, asshole?

299
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,262
我的戒指咧？人渣！
Where's my ring, motherfucker? Stop it. Come on!

300
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,800
我的毛毛指还是空的咧，妈的咧
Put it on my fuzzy finger, you fuck! Come on!

301
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,930
好了，别闹了！
All right, knock it off!

302
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,267
我只是发牢骚
All right, I'm just saying.

303
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,228
你想她会期待我更进一步吗？
But do you think she might be expecting me to make that kind of a move?

304
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,640
我不觉得她想…
况且时机不对
No, l don't think she is. And, not only that, it's the wrong time.

305
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,984
别傻了，现在全球经济不稳定
lt's a terrible idea. l mean, you got the economy.

306
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,270
还有信贷危机，高院争议…
You got the credit bubble, the Supreme Court.

307
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,400
还有海地
l mean, look at Haiti.

308
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,406
我倒没想得这么多
l guess l didn't think about that.

309
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,360
那影响可大的咧
Well, that's. . . lt's a factor.

310
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,950
你究竟是谁？
Who are you?

315
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,966

你买了什么？ -火鸡汉堡
What do you got there?

319
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,180

Are we having homosexuals over for dinner tonight?

320
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,430
就你们两个啊
Ha-ha. No, just you homos.

321
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,770
Whoa! Whoa!

322
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,357
你乱改我的笑话，但…
You kind of just reworded my joke, but, uh. . .

323
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,850
工作还好吧 -还可以
How was work?
lt was fine.

324
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,310
你那个猪头老板咧？
How's your dickhead boss?

325
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,696
雷克斯还好
Rex is fine.

326
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,610
他今天只跟我告白一次，所以还算好
He only hit on me once today, so, it's a good thing.

327
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,284
想喝啤酒吗？
Hey, Johnny, how about a beer?

328
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,702
两瓶查理斯布考斯基？
A couple of Charles Brew-kowskis?

329
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,740
还是两瓶柏思托意斯基？
Couple of Brew-stoyevskis?

330
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,664
不然麦克布高斯基？
Maybe a Mike Brew-gaslowski?

331
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,333
何不来个泰德布鲁斯基？
Perhaps a Tedy Brew-ski?

332
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,500
接得不赖
That's a good one.

333
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,870
我也来个马丁娜纳拉蒂布鲁斯基好了
You know what, l think l, too, want a Martina Navrati-brewski.

334
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,170
这说不通 -别破坏气氛
No, that doesn't work.
Don't ruin it. No.

335
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,549
屁啦！明明就通
Bullshit! That totally works.

336
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,550
说不通
No, no.

337
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,052
说得通 -说不通
Yeah, it does. lt doesn't work.

338
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,470
名字本身结尾一定要是“斯基”
The name has to have a "ski" at the end of it

339
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,056
你只是把“斯基”加在…
纳拉蒂诺娃后面
and you just put "brewski" at the end of "Martina Navratilova," so. . .

340
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,891
我以为只要说出有趣的名字…
l just thought we were saying funny names.

341
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,517
不行，名字一定要有“斯基”
No, it has to have a "ski" at the end of it.

342
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,600
不然那有什么难？
Otherwise, where's the challenge?

343
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,813
如果本身结尾没有“斯基”
lf there's no "ski" at the end of the root word

344
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,940
我们就只是一群白痴在耍智障
then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.

345
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Hey.

346
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,910
失踪的登山客找到了
They found the missing hikers.

347
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,372
找到了吗？ -对
怎么回事？
They did?
Yeah. What happened?

348
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,740
他们说走失了
They said they got separated

349
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,790
其中一人的脚卡在石缝里五天
and one of them had his foot stuck under a rock
for like, five days.

350
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,290
Wow. Mmm.

351
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,250
如果你的脚卡到石缝
You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock

352
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,842
为了救你，我啃也把它啃出来
l'd chew it off to get you free.

353
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,970
真的？ -真的
You would?
l sure would.

354
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,555
这样算吃人肉吗？
ls that cannibalism?

355
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,050
不算，除非你吞下去
No, l think it's only cannibalism if you swallow.

356
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,184
当然不会！
Oh, yeah, no!

357
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,144
放心，我不吞的
Don't worry about that, because l don't swallow.

358
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,020
真的吗？这和传言不一样喔
Really? 'Cause that's not what l heard.

359
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,107
那是谣言，我可是名媛
Well, it's not true, okay? I'm a fucking classy broad.

360
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,730
Yeah.

361
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
是名猿吧
l can see that.

362
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,696
说到名媛…
Listen, speaking of classy,

363
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,865
“哈啰美人”是很高档的义式餐厅
Ciao Bella is a really expensive restaurant.

364
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,868
明天不一定要去那里
So, we can go anywhere else tomorrow.

365
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,490
和你在一起，去哪都好
l really don't care, as long as we're together.

366
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,247
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

367
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,082
我们在一起四年了
No, no, no. Four years, we've been going out.

368
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,250
我要带你去波士顿最棒的餐厅
I'm taking you to the best place in town.

369
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,961
这两天为这事我都忙出屎了
l've been crapping out room for it for two days.

370
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,088
我是说 我知道我们该去哪
l mean, l know exactly what I'm gonna order.

371
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,215
你够恶哦
You are so disgusting.

372
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,718
你知道我爱你
And l love you.

373
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,420
我也爱你 -我也爱你够贱
l love you, too. And you're nasty.

374
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,430
想要一起变坏吗？
Do you want to get nasty?

375
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,933
你这个小贱贱…
You're a nasty girl.

376
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,688
你妹你舅你姥姥
Fucking cocksucker motherfucker!

377
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,770
我真搞不懂

378
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,520

Thirty-five years old and you're still scared of a little thunder.

Thunder buddies for life, right, Johnny? Fucking right.

381
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,617
我们来唱雷雷歌吧 -好啊
Let's sing the thunder song. All right.

382
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,820
当你听见打雷声，千万不要怕
When you hear the sound of thunder Don't you get too scared

383
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,499
快找雷雷伙伴，然后说咒语
Just grab your thunder buddy And say these magic words

You can't get me, thunder 'Cause you're just God's farts

386
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,670

387
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,470
洛莉，闹钟帮我设11点吧
Hey, Lori, can you set the alarm for 11:00 A.M.?

388

389
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,560
早安，洛莉

你看起来闷闷的
You look a little flustered.

393
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,620
我没事
I'm fine, I'm fine,

394
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,870
只是没空吃早餐，加上找不到停车位
l just didn't have time for breakfast and the garage was full,

395
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,120
还有我男朋友遇到打雷…

396
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,420
就要跟泰德熊睡
without his teddy bear.

397
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,500
你怎么能忍受他这种行为？
l don't understand why you keep putting up with him.

398
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,260
都35岁了…
还在租车公司工作
Yeah, l mean, the guy's 35, and he's working for a rental car service.

399
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,260
跟他的工作无关，我不在乎那个
You know, you guys, it's really not about that.

400
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,349
就算他是杂工，我也爱他
l don't care about that. l mean, l'd love him if he was a janitor.

401
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,970
我是说他很善良，我们在一起很开心
l mean, he has a huge heart and we laugh a lot.

402
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,350
况且他又是波士顿的大帅哥
lt's just a bonus that he's the hottest guy in Boston.

403
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,440
我不知道，我只希望他有担当一点
l don't know. l just wish he would get his life together.

404
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,940
就当为了我们，但他做不到
Our life. And he can't.

405
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,520
我敢打包票，绝对是那只熊害的
And, l swear to God, it is because of that bear.

406
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,610
你应该下最后通牒，你和熊二选一
You should give him an ultimatum. lt's you or the bear.

407
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,950
我不能这样，他会受不了的
No, l can't do that. That would devastate him.

408
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,620
况且，要是他选泰德呢？
Besides, what if he chose Ted?

409
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,950
哈啰
Well, hello there.

410
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,751
我不是故意打断你们…
Sorry if I'm interrupting any private girl-talk

411
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,750
是聊查宁塔图的食指吧
about Channing Tatum's index finger.

412
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,040
不过，洛莉，请你来我办公室一趟
But, Lori, l need to see you in my office.

413
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,380
问题是我很忙
Yeah, the thing is, Rex, l have a lot of work l need to get to. . .

414
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,052
我要跟你谈公事，我保证
Oh, this is work, l swear.

415
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,222
好吧
Great.

416
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,349
保重 -谢谢
Good luck. Thank you.

417
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,680
他是大贱人
He's such an asshole.

418
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,680
完全不收敛，简直是败类
Out of control. He's such a sleaze.

419
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,730
我敢赌一百块
他一定会拿出他潜水校队的照片
A hundred bucks says he's showing her the diving team photo.

420
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,730
你看
Check this out.

421
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,150
这是我高中参加潜水校队的英姿
That's me on the high school diving team.

422
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,110
我们那年不知道潜到哪去了
We dove the shit out of that pool that year.

423
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,034
近些看 还有清晰的激凸
Now, if you look close, you can see the outline of my root.

424
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,780
你答应我只谈公事
You promised me this was about work.

425
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,070
洛莉
你为什么就是不喜欢我？
Lori, why don't you like me? Ugh!

426
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,240
我有钱，我帅，公司又是我爸的
I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company.

427
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,418
我有男朋友了，我告诉过你
l have a boyfriend. l have told you this.

428
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,040
对，泰迪熊男
Yeah, the guy with the bear.

429
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,170
洛莉，我在跟你谈成熟的两性关系
But I'm talking about a mature relationship, Lori.

430
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,590
如果我俩合体，小孩一定超美
lf we were together, our babies would be spectacular.

431
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,260
有我傲视群雄的白人基因加上你…
With my top-of-the-pyramid Caucasian genes and your splash of

432
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,600
黝黑、美丽、灰濛濛的…
dark, beautiful, smoky. . .

433
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,680
我忘了是波罗的海，还是捷克？
Baltic? Czech?

434
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,390
先告辞了，雷克斯
Goodbye, Rex.

435
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,565
-那好 你被开了
-才不会
Okay, you're fired. No. I'm not.

436
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,590
Oh!

437
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,886
很好吃
Okay, that was perfect.

438
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,554
需要为您打包吗？
Would you like me to wrap your leftovers?

439
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,181
不用，谢谢
No, I'm good. Thank you.

440
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,010
可以麻烦你打包这个吗？
Actually, could you wrap just this up for me?

441
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,260
我想拿来吓唬人
l want to scare the shit out of somebody.

442
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,393
没问题
Sure.

443
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,729
你才五岁吗？ -对
What are you, five years old?
Yeah.

444
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,148
但我阅读能力有六岁，所以…
But l read at a six-year-old level, so. . .

445
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,560
两位，这是甜点…
Sir, and madam, here is your dessert

446
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,697
与香槟
and champagne.

447
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,030
Ooh!

448
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,610
<i>水晶香槟</i>…
Cristal.

449
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,360
这是特别的夜晚，我们的四周年
lt's a special night. We've been dating for four years.

450
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,164
有钱饶舌歌手的品味不会错
And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right?

451
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,586
四年一转眼就过了
lt doesn't feel like four years, does it?

452
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,546
对阿，好快
No, it doesn't.

453
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,000
你根本不该下舞池跳舞的
You know, you had no business being out on that dance floor,

454
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,260
但我很开心那天你有
but I'm really happy that you were.

455
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:17,849
2008年

456
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,050
这首歌很好听
This song is so great.

457
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,230
选克里斯布朗不会错的
Oh, yeah. Chris Brown can do no wrong.

458
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
你还真会扭
Wow, you can really move.

459
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,943
不错吧？让你看看这个
You like that, huh? Check this shit out.

460
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,826
天哪
Oh, my God!

461
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,910
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

462
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,200
真抱歉
Oh, God, l am so sorry.

463
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,450
我没事
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

464
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,291
真抱歉，我没看到你，我不是故意的
Jesus, l am so sorry. l didn't see you. lt was an accident.

465
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,450
有撞到头吗？
Did you hurt your head?

466
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,160
我头很痛
Yeah, my head hurts a lot.

467
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,879
天啊，我去帮你拿些冰块
Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice.

468
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,846
抱歉，还痛吗？
Sorry, sorry. Does it hurt?

469
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,352
不痛了
No. lt's fine.

470
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,981
我要测试你有没有把我放在心上
Okay, here's a test to see how much you actually care about me.

471
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,480
那天晚上离开夜店…
You remember that night, after the club

472
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,400
很晚了我们还去吃宵夜到5点
we went and had late-night eggs and waffles until about 5:00 A.M.

473
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,530
看着餐厅里小电视播的电影
We watched a movie on the little TV in the diner.

474
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,992
说出片名
Name that movie.

475
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,451
八爪女
Octopussy.

476
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,530
宝贝你好棒！
Baby! Gold star.

477
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,910
还有…我的舞技还算不错
And, by the way, my dancing was not that bad.

478
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,830
明明就很逊 -我动作很酷耶
lt was pretty bad. l have cool moves.

479
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,294
跟老人痴呆患者不相上下
Yeah, so do people with Parkinson's.

480
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,620
我记得不是这样
That's not how l remember it.

481
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,213
不然你记得什么
Okay, how do you remember it?

482
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,953
算了，随便你怎么说
All right, whatever you say.

483
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,370
Hey Yes?

484
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,873
敬下一个四年
Here's to four more years.

485
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,459
你是我的开心果
Okay. You make me happy.

486
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,210
我们是说过不送礼物的
Now, l know we said no gifts, but. . .

487
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,253
我们有说过吗？
We said no such thing.

488
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,214
我还是买了礼物，显然违反规定
l got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.

489
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,466
没那种规定
We had no such rule.

490
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,094
洛莉…
这样东西，我早就想送给你了
Lori, l've wanted to give this to you for a long time.

491
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,474
强…
John. . .

492
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,857
你应该会喜欢吧，我从家乐服买来的
Those are the ones you like, right? From that kiosk at the mall.

493
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,440
Yeah.

494
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,980
洛莉…
You know, Lori,

495
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,573
有一天，这会放着戒指
someday, there's going to be a ring in there.

496
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,284
我想等我买得起特别礼物的那一天
But l want to wait until l get you something really special.

497
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,620
我现在还没有钱
l just don't have the money right now.

498
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,910
我说这些是因为我爱你
Look, I'm only saying this because l love you.

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,160
你再继续和泰德鬼混就不会有前途
You're not going to have any sort of career
if you keep wasting time with Ted.

500
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,337
又来了！
Oh, jeez, here we go.

501
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,047
宝贝，为了我们的将来…
Baby, please ask Ted to move out

502
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,540
泰德一定要搬走
so we can move on with our lives.

503
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,134
洛莉，我和他8岁就是好朋友
Lori, look, he's been my best friend since l was eight.

504
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,800
我并不是受欢迎的小孩
l was not a popular child.

505
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,180
你必须了解，他出现以前我没有朋友
You have to understand, l had no friends before he came along.

506
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,600
都因为他，我才建立起自信的
He's the only reason l ever gained any fucking confidence.

507
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,060
否则又会多几起校园枪击事件
l could have wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech,

508
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,353
多亏了泰德
but l didn't 'cause of him.

509
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,064
所以我也不会傻到...把他赶走
So, you know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.

510
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,442
一只会说话的抱抱熊让你的同学们...
Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing

511
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,193
免遭厄运 真是令人欣慰
that prevented you from gunning down your classmates.

512
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,320
但你已经不是8岁小孩，你35了
But you're no longer eight. You're 35 years old.

513
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,158
除非你还傻傻没发现
And unless you're too blind to notice,

514
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,360
他早已不是你唯一的朋友
he's not your only friend anymore.

515
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,580
以后再说好吗？好好享受这顿晚餐吧
Can we talk about this another time,
and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?

516
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,880
等我一下
Oh, shit, hang on a second.

517
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,136
我的手机好像掉在椅子下
Now my phone fell under the seat somewhere.

518
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,260
可以打我手机吗？
Can you call it?

519
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,670
Yeah.

520
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,480
这是我的专属铃声吗？
ls that my ringtone?

521
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,320
Oh, yeah.

522
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,900
那是什么音乐？听起来很阴沉
What is it? 'Cause it sounds negative.

523
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,953
哪会，是手札情缘的插曲耶
No, no, it's from The Notebook.

524
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,820
Oh.

525
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,080
这要花些时间
This is going to take some doing, l think.

526
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,450
那我先上楼
I'll just meet you upstairs then?

527
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,080
我马上来
Yeah, I'll be right there.

528
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,170
Oh!

529
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,880
洛莉，你怎么提早回来？
Lori, hey, you're home early.

530
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,590
你在搞什么？
What the hell is this?

531
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,090
我和美女们在看龙凤大双胞
The ladies and l were just watching Jack and Jill.

532
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,062
亚当山德勒分饰双胞胎兄妹
史上大烂片
Adam Sandler plays a guy and his sister, and it's just awful.

533
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,270
惨不忍睹
lt's unwatchable.

534
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,100
但她们是妓女，所以无所谓啦
But, they're hookers, so it's fine.

535
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,693
搞得乱七八糟，她们是谁？
This place is a wreck. Who are these girls?

536
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,400
我真没礼貌
Oh. Where are my manners?

537
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:44,190
这是安洁莉、海芬莉、雪莉和玫瑰红
Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc.

538
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,610
我爱你们
l love you girls.

539
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,161
在某个地方，有四个混帐父亲
You know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers

540
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,320
我真想找机会好好谢谢他们
l wish l could thank for this great night.

541
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,830
那是什么？
What is that?

542
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,370
什么？
What is what?

543
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,000
那里有坨…
There is. . .

544
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,005
大便在我的地板上
. . .a shit on my floor.

545
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,382
角落那里有坨大便！
ln the corner, there is a shit!

546
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,633
我的个老天
Oh, my God! You know what?

547
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,593
大概是迪娅德拉
That's probably what Dierdre was doing over there.

548
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,096
她之前在那里蹲了蛮久
Remember she was crouched over in the corner for a really long time?

549
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,973
我还以为在打电话呢
l thought she was just making a phone call or something.

550
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,100
我的地板上有大便！
There is a shit on my floor!

551
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,477
嗯 她已经瘫在厕所了
Yeah. Yeah. She's passed out in the bathroom now.

552
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,604
八成是嗨药过度
She seemed like she was hopped up on something,

553
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,898
你看 谜底揭开了 对吧
but, you know, mystery solved, l guess, right?

554
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,191
她的便便
She was taking a shit.

555
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,484
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

556
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,823
谁住在这儿？我要对付他
Who lives here? I'm coming to get whoever lives here.

557
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,450
你欠我龙虾餐的钱
You owe me lobster money.

558
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,360
他是我麻吉，强
That's my buddy, Johnny.

559
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,037
我不是说龙虾，是那只手
Not the lobster, the guy running it.

560
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,456
我找到电话了
l found my phone.

561
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,530
怎么了？
What's going on?

562
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,544
那个是大便吗？
ls that a shit?

563
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,562
阿娘喂，这些怪鱼有够丑
God, there are some fucked-up fish out there.

564
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,060
看这一只，天龙鱼
Look at that one. WASP-y, white-guy fish.

565
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:02,690
我娶错人了，现在好后悔呀
"l married the wrong woman, and now l lead a life of regret."

566
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,900
再看这一只
Oh, look at this guy.

567
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,034
我1981年去过纽约… 感觉好不安全
"l went to New York once in 1981, and l just did not feel safe."

568
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,163
泰德，你得要搬出去住
Ted, you gotta move out.

569
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,410
什么？
What?

570
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,168
总会有这么一天
lt's got to happen.

571
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,838
我做了什么？
What did l do?

572
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,842
我的爱情快要吹了
My relationship is at a very delicate stage, you know.

573
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,221
我和洛莉现在很需要空间
Lori and l may just need a little space right now.

574
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,590
还有…妓女竟然在我们家挫赛
Plus, a hooker took a shit in our apartment.

575
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,350
天哪！ -什么？
Oh, God! Ah, what?

576
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,550
恶毙了！
Oh, this is so gross!

577
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,640
别跟我说！你拿起来了吗？
Don't tell me! l don't want to hear about it! Did you get it?

578
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,600
还没！ -拿好再跟我说！
No, l didn't get it! Tell me when you get it!

579
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,270
天哪，我的拇指沾到大便！
Oh, my God, l got some on my thumb!

580
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,694
你以后别用那只手煮饭！
No! You can never cook with that hand again!

581
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,610
你要练习用左手煮饭
Oh, my God! You have to learn to cook left-handed.

582
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,610
真的恶毙了！
This is the most disgusting thing ever!

583
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,110
别过来！拿远一点！
Don't! Get it away from me!

584
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,110
那一晚，我们都不好受
Look, that was a tough night for all of us.

585
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,910
泰德，你对我很重要，洛莉也是
Ted, you mean everything to me, and so does Lori.

586
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,959
我只是希望你们两个都能在我生命里
I'm just trying to find a way to keep you both in my life.

587
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,420
她逼你的对不对？
She's making you do it, isn't she?

588
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,080
对
Yes.

589
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,384
但又不是绝交，我们还是能一起混
But that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time.

590
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,380
那“一辈子雷雷伙伴”的誓言呢？
Yeah, but what about "thunder buddies for life," Johnny?

591
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,970
我记得，但我能怎么办呢？
l know. l just don't know what to do, here.

592
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:17,010
我知道很没义气… 可是不然我会失去她
l know it sucks, but otherwise I'm going to lose her.

593
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,680
我真的很爱她，泰德
And l do love her, Ted.

594
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,930
我知道你爱她，强
l know you do, Johnny.

595
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,350
我会尽全力帮你的，我保证
I'll help you get on your feet out there, l promise.

596
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,735
我懂，我们随时都能一起混吧？
l know. And we'll hang out all the time, right?

597
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,310
随时
All the time.

598
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,190
算了，抱一下，过来
Fuck it. Bring it in. Come here.

599
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,190
抱一下，你这个王八蛋
Bring it in, you bastard. Come on.

600
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,076
我爱你
l love you!

601
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,950
该死…这是…那个…
Fuck. Shit, sorry, that's the thing from the. . .

602
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,950
以前的… -对阿
The old. . . Yeah, yeah.

603
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,450
我不搞基 -我懂
I'm not gay. l know.

604
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,660
你也不搞基，所以我们ok
And you're not gay, so we're fine.

605
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,330
我要帮你找份工作
We gotta get you a job.

606
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,790
我看起来蠢毙了
l look stupid.

607
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,090
怎么会，你帅呆了
No you don't. You look dapper.

608
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,550
少来 看到我就想到柔软精小熊的会计师
l don't. l look like Snuggle's accountant.

609
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,920
没那么差啦
Come on, it's not that bad.

610
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,380
强，我就像安慰小孩的礼物…
John, l look like something you give your kid

611
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,970
…就只因为他阿嬷葛屁
when you tell him Grandma died.

612
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,010
我知道这感觉很糟
Look, l know it sucks, okay?

613
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,260
但你必须赚点钱，才能付房租
But you've got to make some money
so you can pay for an apartment.

614
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,390
我不想在杂货店打工
l don't want to work at a grocery store.

615
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,850
但你没有一技之长啊
Yeah, but you have no skills.

616
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,020
都说了，我当律师ok的
l told you, l can totally be a lawyer.

617
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,569
那也得去法学院混个学位
As l said, you would need a law degree from a law school.

618
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,613
不用 我是特例
No. No. I'm a special case.

619
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,698
我不就是个熊嘛
I'm a. . . I'm a talking teddy bear, for Christ's sake.

620
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,325
没人会计较的  他们只会觉得
They might make an exception 'cause they'd be all like,

621
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,784
“老天  这熊酷毙了
"Oh, my God! This bear's so cool.

622
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,286
“能说会做 可以留下来
"He can talk and do stuff. Let's give him a job.

623
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,330
“说不定还能让办公室有些生气
"Maybe he'll give us a few laughs around the office."

624
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,249
然后他们就会发现  “妈啊 这家伙口才这么好
And then they're like, "Oh, my God! He can deliver.

625
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,834
“天生打官司的料啊”
"He's actually quite a litigator."

626
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,378
然后安德森的案子就归我了
And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.

627
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,840
你找到工作，我们再来庆祝好不好？
You get the job, we're celebrating after, okay?

628
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:33,094
没找到工作，我们还是能哈吧？
Uh-huh. And if l don't get the job,
are we still going to smoke that pot?

629
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,590
应该没问题
Probably, yes.

630
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,680
那好吧，获益良多，谢谢教练
Uh-huh. Okay, all right. Good talk, coach, thanks.

631
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,765
兄弟，加油！
All right, buddy, go get 'em.

632
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,853
别担心 我会尽全力争取我梦寐以求的工作
And don't worry, I'll do my very best
to get this job that l so crave.

633
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,520
你觉得你有必备的条件吗？
So you think you got what it takes?

634
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,776
必备的条件…吃你老婆的鲍鲍算不算
I'll tell you what l got. Your wife's pussy on my breath.

635
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,114
从来没有人敢这样跟我说话
Nobody's ever talked to me like that before.

636
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,570
那是因为他们忙着舔你老婆没空说
That's 'cause everyone's mouth is usually full of your wife's box.

637
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,910
你录取了
You're hired.

638
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,288
靠北
Shit.

639
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,830
我以前是大明星，现在却拿基本工资
Well, l am a former celebrity in a minimum wage job.

640
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,670
“好晓子”的演员应该就是这种感觉
This is how the cast of Diff'rent Strokes feels.

641
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,960
整天…每天…真是糟透了
All day, every day. Just awful.

642
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,340
他们一定很难过，还活着的更是难受
They must feel awful. The live ones must feel awful.

643
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,510
没那么糟好吗？
Come on. lt's not that bad, okay?

644
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,050
我的工作很鸟，但我真的很快乐
l got a shitty job, and l assure you, l am quite content.

645
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,430
不好意思
Excuse me.

646
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,850
抱歉打扰你们一下
I'm sorry to bother you

647
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,023
我和我儿子超崇拜你的泰迪熊
but my son and l couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.

648
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,770
谢谢 -谢谢
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

649
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,940
我是唐尼，这是罗伯特
Yeah. I'm Donny, this is Robert.

650
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:16,860
我必须说，我小时候就很喜欢你
l have to say, l've been following you ever since l was a young boy

651
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,701
我记得你上过卡尔森脱口秀
and l remember seeing you on the Carson show.

652
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,203
你超搞笑
You were just wonderful.

653
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:24,700
那是一场诡异的访问
Oh, yeah, that was a weird interview.

654
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,209
艾德以为我是外星人 一直说着反犹言论
Ed thought l was ALF, and he kept muttering anti-Semitic comments.

655
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,330
他以为外星人就是犹太人
He thought ALF was Jewish for some reason.

656
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:32,087
你有考虑卖掉这只熊吗？
Have you ever considered selling the bear?

657
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,380
什么？ -再说一次
What? Excuse me?

658
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,670
我想买它
l want it.

659
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,051
老兄，我不是物品，我是人好吗？
I'm not an "it," pal. I'm a "he," all right?

660
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,510
很抱歉，小兄弟，我的熊是非卖品
I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale.

661
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:41,470
我从你这个年纪就认识他
See, l've had him since l was about your age.

662
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,260
他是我非常特别的朋友
He's very, very special to me.

663
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,684
跟我说话的时候，给我站直
Stand up straight when you're talking to me.

664
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,640
他妈的这小子有病喔？
Why the fuck would he say that?

665
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,810
你不应该在小孩面前骂脏话
Sorry, you really shouldn't swear in front of children.

666
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,560
我们很喜欢这只熊
Look, we're very interested in the bear.

667
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,270
如果你改变心意…
lf you want to make some sort of arrangement

668
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:56,060
这是我的地址和电话
here's my address and phone number.

669

见鬼了
What the fuck?

676
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,710
你能想象那个死小孩会怎么对我吗？
Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?

677
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,671
我可以想见他把你拖到地下室…
l could totally see him just taking you down to the basement

678
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,290
慢慢肢解你…
and really slowly de-limbing you

679
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:17,710
一边哼着惊悚的儿歌
while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.

680
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,135
六便士，我可爱的六便士
Oh, my IittIe sixpence My pretty little sixpence

681
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:22,470
闭嘴
Stop it. Knock it off.

682
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,050
我爱我的六便士 比我的生命还宝贵
l love my sixpence Better than my life

683
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,010
闭嘴！你为什么要说这么诡异的事
Stop it! Fuck! Why you got to take it to that place?

684
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:28,640
你说得这么…现在我想忘了也不可能
You took it to a very. . . Now it's real. Now it's a real thing.

别这样啦，轻松点
Come on. Take it easy.

686
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,940
咱们找个好地方来high吧
All right, look, let's just find a better place to get stoned.

687
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,422
今晚就这样啰
l guess this is it, huh?

688
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,966
大概吧
Yeah. Yeah, l guess so.

689

享受我豪华新公寓的第一晚

692
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,350
房东还说，这里几乎没发生过凶案
Yeah, and the guy said it ain't hardly had no murders in it.

693
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,394
所以还不赖
So, that's good.

694
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,020
如果有任何需要…
Okay, so, if you need anything. . .

695
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,818
我知道，别担心，我会照顾自己

00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,860
我知道你心里很不好受
l know what you did with Ted wasn't easy,

703
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,780
但我希望你明白我很感谢你的牺牲…

704
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:10,871
我们以后就能重新开始

我愿意为你做任何事

真的吗？
Really?

709
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:23,380
你知道…
Well, you know,

我还有20分钟才要上班
l don't have to be at work for another 20 minutes.

你知道我最喜欢你哪一点吗？

那就是四年了，你还能给我惊喜
That, even after four years, you can still surprise me.

715
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,241
你负起责任，做这么大的改变…
To step up and change such a huge part of your life

716
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,110
只为了让你女朋友开心…
just to make your girlfriend happier. . .

717
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:53,240
大部分的男生可能不会这么做
l don't know, l guess most guys wouldn't do that.

718
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,750
谁叫他们没有像你这么可爱的女朋友
Well, most guys don't have you to motivate them.

719

l know I'm not a talking teddy bear,

720
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,960
但你不用许什么愿望就能跟我在一起
but at least you didn't have to make a magical wish to get me.

721
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:08,130
你又知道我没许愿了？
How do you know?

722
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,350
Oh.

723

你是口袋里有枪
还是见到我乐坏了？
ls that a Flash Gordon ray gun,
or are you just happy to see me?

724
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:33,200

Something l call a Dirty Fozzie.

00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,970
好吧，我知道你底线在哪了
Okay, all right, so that's where we'll draw the line.

733
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,930
还好吧？
Hey, how are you holding up?

734
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,140
我很好  正在适应，没什么
Oh, I'm all right. I'm just getting used to things, that's all.

735
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,690

We were together for eight months, and l really loved him.

739
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:58,372
可是政府却把他遣返回伊朗…
And then he got deported back to lran,

740
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,950
我能感同身受
so l know what you're going through.

741
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,710
我们都失去了亲爱的多毛男
Oh, yeah. So, l guess we both lost our furry little guy.

742
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,420

We sure did.

可以啊，下班后
Well, l could probably stop by after work.

747
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,720
没诚意，我还特别和同事调班
Fuck that. l traded off yesterday so l got the other shift.

l cannot just ditch work, man.

750
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,310
我正在为了洛莉…
Look, I'm trying to get my shit together

751
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,100
做一个负责任的人
and be an adult here, for Lori's sake.

五分钟一定轰你走
l will kick you out in five. John, l have to kick you out.

l have so much teddy bear paperwork l have to get to, it is sick.

759
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,587
我要怎么跟汤玛斯说？
What do l tell Thomas?

760
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,080
就说你不舒服
Just tell him you don't feeI well.

761
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,340
我必须出去一下
l gotta cut out for a bit.

762
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,758
洛莉为了拉开打架的狗
Lori tried to break up a dog fight

763
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,210
好像受了点伤
and l guess she got hurt pretty bad.

764
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,550
啥米？
Oh, my God!

765
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,263
她这个人也真是的
Yeah, that's the way she is.

766
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,880
看到狗打架就想劝架
She sees trouble and she wants to help out,

767
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:00,510
结果一只狗紧咬她的前臂
and l guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm

768
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,600
等到消防员戳了屁眼才肯松口
and wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up
and stuck his finger in his ass.

769
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,390
天哪
Oh, Jesus.

770
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,774
她现在惊魂未定
Yeah, she's pretty shook up.

771
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,690
是戳狗的屁眼吧
Up the dog's ass, right?

772
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,400
对，狗的，不是消防员的
Yeah, up the dog's, not the fireman's ass.

773
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,900
我还以为消防员戳自己屁眼
l thought the fireman stuck his own finger up his own ass.

774
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,740
我不认为消防员会这么做
No, l don't think a firefighter would do that.

775
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,860
快去照顾她，再跟我报告

You know, he's exactly who you want him to be.

789
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,289

00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,470
这名字明明很可怕
lt doesn't sound very mellow.

798
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,470
他还有另外三种货
Well, he only had three other batches.

799
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,856
“猩猩大暴走”
"Gorilla Panic,"

800
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,810
“它们要来了”
"They're Coming, They're Coming,"

801
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,770
还有“人生终点”
and something called, "This is Permanent."

802
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,777
开饭吧
Go on, spark it up.

803
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,820
就这样…大口一点
There you go. You got it.

804
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,125
不赖吧？吸得好
Nice. Good, huh? Good job.

805
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,330
你该感到自豪
Yeah. Take pride in that.

806
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,120
这地方看起来真棒
You know, this place looks great.

807
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,040
谢谢，整间都是lKEA的
Thanks, man, it's all lKEA.

808
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,591
只花了47块
Did the whole place for $47.

809
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,500
厉害
Nice. Yeah.

810
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,136
邻居怎么样？
How are the neighbors?

811
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,550
隔壁是一家亚洲人
You know, there's an Asian family living next door

812
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,840
幸好不会敲锣打鼓，所以还可以
but they don't have a gong or nothing, so it's not too bad.

813
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,768
你真幸运 -真的！
That's lucky. Yeah, it is.

814
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,811
工作顺利吗？ -烂透了
How's work? lt sucks.

815
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,600
你呢？ -还不差
You?
You know, not bad actually.

816
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,149
我煞到一个收银妹
l met a girl. She's a cashier.

817
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,850
真的吗？太爽了吧
No way, that's awesome! Yeah.

818
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,600
咱们两对找机会吃个饭吧
Well, we should fucking double-date, or something.

819
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,310
你、我、洛莉，她叫什么着？
You, me and Lori, and what's her name?

820
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,947
菜市场名，猜一下
White trash name. Guess.

821
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,450

Don't fuck with me on this. l know this shit!

826
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,000
你有看到我在呼咙你吗？
Do you see me fucking with you? All right, speed round.

827
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,834
我会认真的
I'm going to rattle off some names

828
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,710
现在开始我会一直说，中了你就喊停
and when l hit it, fucking buzz it.

829
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,088
我会的 -准备好了吗？

雅惠 -都不对
Fucking Becky? No.

838
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,981
是不是什么玲什么玲的？
Wait, was it any one of those names with a "Lynn" after it?

839
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,526
是 -妈的，我了了
Yes.

00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,114
我靠！
Fuck!

843
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,610
搞什么？
What the hell?

844
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,910
可以多开几个收银台吗？
Hey, man, you think you can open more than one register?

845
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,620
排队的人这么多…
There's, like, 1,000 people here.

846
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,916
应该有三个收银员的
There's supposed to be three registers open.

847
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,001
乱七八糟的
For God's sakes.

848
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,684
用手指勾住我的标签
Stick your finger in the loop of my tag.

849
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,100
你竟然跟同事乱搞…
You had sexual intercourse with a co-worker

850
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,065
还躺在要卖的生鲜蔬菜上
on top of the produce that we sell to the public.

851
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,440
我上周拿萝卜插她
l fucked her with a parsnip last week

852
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,904
用完还卖给一家六口
and l sold the parsnip to a family with four small children.

853
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,325
你真有勇气，人就是要有勇气
That took guts. We need guts.

854
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,202
我要升你职
I'm promoting you.

855
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,038
你这人真的有病
You got a lot of problems, don't you?

856
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,595
天勾 贾巴尔
All right, Kareem!

857
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,848
靠  地沟了
Ah! You suck, Kareem.

858
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,606
有人吗？
Hello?

859
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,560
Huh.

860
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,570
泰德
Hey, Ted.

861
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,578
怎么是你？
Hey there, fella. How are you?

862
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,955
一个人吗？
Are you out here all alone?

863
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
才不呢
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

864
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,330
怎么会一个人，耶稣与我们同在
You know, you're never alone when you're with Christ.

865
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,710
我才不寂寞咧
So, no, I'm not alone.

866
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,966
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

867
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,972
我和罗伯特会给你一个温暖的家
You know, Robert and l could give you a very, very good home.

868
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,390
我很满意目前的生活
Yeah, I'm pretty happy where l am.

869
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,893
我刚租了间破公寓
l just got a shitty new apartment. . .

870
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,729
我可以给你六千元的铁路公司债券
l can offer you $6,000 in railroad bonds.

871
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,100
如果我是刚解放完黑奴回来…
Well, you know, since l just returned
from active duty in the Civil War

872
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,560
你的提议就听起来不错
that actually sounds very appealing.

873
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,860
很抱歉
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

874
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,156
那是150年前的垃圾，我不需要
That was 150 years ago and l don't give a shit.

875
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,820
Okay.

876
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,950
泰德，跟你朋友的晚餐约会要迟到了
Teddy, come on, we're going to be late for dinner with your friends.

877
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,530
宝贝，我马上好了
Okay, be there in a second, baby.

878
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,950
你也看到了，我没时间
As you can see, my dance card is quite full.

879
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,669
只好跟你说抱歉
So, I'm going to have to decline.

880
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,087
可以跟你拥抱吗？
Can l just get a hug?

881
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,422
嗯…不行
Oh, uh. No.

882
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,174
真的？ -不行
Yeah. No, no.

883
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,344
我喜欢逗人开心…
所以拒绝你我心如刀割
And it kills me to have to tell you no, because I'm a people pleaser.

884
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,553
我懂
Yeah.

885
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,597
谢谢你今晚在这里吓我
Thank you for creeping up my night.

886
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,380
耶稣与你同在…
And Jesus be with you. . . Okay.

887
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,470
…在耶稣恩泽里
. . .in Christ.

888
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,470
他是谁？
Who was that guy?

889
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,773
潘美沉，她换发型了
That was Sinead O'Connor.
She don't look so good no more.

890
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,195
当时我快气疯了
See. l was all pissed off

891
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,488
去年 我跟朋友丹尼尔
'cause me and my friend Danielle

892
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,574
准备去玩跳伞
was supposed to go skydiving last year,

893
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,702
但这个混球把她肚子搞大了
我们就没法去了
but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go.

894
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,120
我难过得要命
And l was all upset.

895
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,581
结果她流产了
But then she had a miscarriage

896
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,541
所以最后还是去跳了伞
and so, we ended up getting to go skydiving.

897
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,753
很吓人 但也超爽
And it was so scary, but it was, like, so much fun.

898
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,547
好吧 这样差不多够圆满
Hey, well, sounds like everything worked out then, huh?

899
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:09,552
我懂了 这都是上帝的旨意 是吧
l know! You know, it's like God wanted me to go skydiving, you know?

900
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,762
老天
Jesus.

901
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,889
嗯 也可能是老天爷
Or Jesus. Him, too. Could be him.

902
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,015
对
Yeah.

903
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
太棒了啦，我们四个出来吃饭
How great is this? The four of us out to dinner.

904
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,145
一直说好要吃饭…
How long have we been saying we were going to. . .

905
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,060
洛莉，过得怎么样？我们好久没聊了
Lori, how you doing? l haven't talked to you in forever.

906
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,890
我很好
I'm good. I'm good.

907
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,560
我们公司下周要举办20周年派对
The company's having their 20th anniversary party next week.

908
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,270
这是大事
So, that's something.

909
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,650
洛莉是大型公关公司的资深副总裁
Lori's a senior VP at a big, huge PR firm.

910
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,490
这不值一提啦
lt's not that big of a deal.

911
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,740
20岁了？
Company's turning 20, huh?

912
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,245
是可以上床却不能喝酒的年纪
So you can bang it, but you can't get it drunk.

913
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,870
没错吧？她懂的
Right? Yeah, she gets it.

914
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,667
她很欣赏我的幽默
She enjoys my humor.

915
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,910
雷克斯会举办家庭派对
Yeah, Rex is having a house party

916
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,330
我很惊讶强没告诉你，因为…
but I'm surprised John didn't tell you, considering

917
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,290
你搬出去之后，你们天天都见面
you two have seen each other every single day since you moved out.

918
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,220
其实每次我和强聚在一起…
You know, it's funny, because whenever Johnny and l hang out

919
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,550
第一项议程永远都是…
the first item on our agenda is,

920
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,840
洛莉最近怎么样？
"What's going on with Lori?"

921
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,260
所以没聊到这个，一定是忘了
So, it's funny that that didn't come up.
That must have slipped through the cracks.

922
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,810
没错，我们一直聊到你
Yeah, but we do talk about you all the time.

923
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,680
你还记得有一天，我说…
Yeah, you remember the other day, l was saying

924
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,140
洛莉的头发怎么永远这么漂亮
how great Lori's hair always looks.

925
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,363
怎么看怎么美！害我忍不住想梳它
Oh, my God, it always looks so great!
l always want to fucking brush it.

926
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,650
强，我说过吧？
Right, Johnny? l say that.

927
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,070
玉玲…
So, Tami-Lynn,

928
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,490
自我介绍一下吧
why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?

929
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,700
譬如你从哪里来？
Like, where are you from?

930
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,450
我一直想见泰德的女朋友们
I'm always fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends.

931
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,450
你用“们”是什么意思？
What do you mean "girlfriends"?

932
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,210
他交过很多女朋友吗？
Was there a lot of them or something?

933
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,756
她不是这个意思，洛莉，对吧？
No, that's not what she meant at all. Right, Lori?

934
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,216
你不是这个意思 -当然不是
Lori, you didn't mean that. No, no, no.

935
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,380
我是说泰德很迷人
What l meant to say was Ted's very handsome

936
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:35,305
我想看看哪个女生可以钓到他
so I'm always interested in meeting
the lady that can snatch him up.

937
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,220
你是在骂我是妓女吗？ -什么？
Did you just call me a whore?
What?

938
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,978
管好你自己的缝，说什么屁话？
You just worry about your own "snatch." How about that, honey?

939
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,850
怎么了？明明是轻松的晚餐
What the hell happened? We're having a friendly meal here.

940
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,898
如此美好的夜晚…
This was a nice evening.

941
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,140
少说屁话
Don't talk shit to me.

942
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,609
我只是问你问题
l just asked you a question.

943
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,236
你狗眼看人低
You know, you're a freaking snob.

944
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,155
大公司上班就了不起！
You think you're cool because you work
at some fucking fancy shit place, whatever.

945
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,570
别气了，洛莉你干嘛要这样
Okay, take it easy. Nice, Lori, real nice.

946
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,910
不是我的问题，是她英文不好
Me? lt's not my fault she can't speak English.

947
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,110
滚你妈的
Oh, fuck you!

948
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,080
在大公司上班屌个屁？
Just because you're on the business world and shit you think, what,

949
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,080
我们都该吃你大便吗？
everybody should suck your asshole, or something?

950
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,501
好了，玉玲宝贝，我们走吧
Okay. All right, Tami, come on, honey. Let's get out of here.

951
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,910
我们回家喝伏特加草莓调酒吧
We'll go back to my place for a couple of vodka and strawberry Quiks.

952
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,630
你他妈最好管好自己的屁眼儿
You know what? Stick your fucking asshole right up your fucking ass.

953
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,341
懂不 要不是老娘还穿着礼服
How about that? You're lucky I'm in my fucking restaurant clothes, bitch.

954
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,177
肯定把你屎都踹出来
'Cause l'd kick your fucking ass right now.

955
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,550
告诉你 我生过小孩  贱货
l gave birth once, bitch.

956
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,847
我会打得你哭着找妈妈
l could kick your fucking ass.

957
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,180
你最好别再出现，听到了没？
And you better never show your face around Quincy, you hear me?

958
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,470
好了
Okay, come on. Ever!

959
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,352
我不知道你有小孩，还活着吗？
l didn't know you had a baby. ls it alive?

960
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,189
贱鲍一个
What a cunt.

961
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,020
别说那个词
Ow! l hate that word!

962
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,100
哪个词？ -就那个词
What? That word.

963
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,900
太伤人了，就像光剑划过全身
lt's so sharp, it's like an electric sword
slashing everything in its path.

964
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,230
何必骂成这样？
Why would you say that?

965
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,239
你根本不站在我这边
You didn't exactly stand up for me.

966
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,820
我试着保持中立
I'm trying to walk a line, here.

967
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,201
要对你们两个都公平
l want to be fair to you and to him, you know?

968
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,110
你明明就偏袒他
l think you're being a little more fair to him.

969
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,370
哪有
Oh, come on.

970
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,875
你老板今天早上打来问我的手伤
You know, your boss called this morning asking me how my arm was.

971
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,700
Huh?

972
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:50,000
就是那个我被狗咬的事
Yeah, because of that dog fight that l tried to break up.

973
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,830
Oh.

974
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,425
如果要我猜…
lf l had to make a guess

975
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,710
你一定是在编借口
l would say that you made up some bullshit excuse

976
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,170
翘班去找泰德
to get out of work to go to Ted's.

977
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,723
我猜对了吧？
Now, am l right?

978
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,392
听起来你很爱动物啊
l made you out to be a hero.

979
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,760
我们请泰德搬出去…
You know what, John, we asked Ted to move out

980
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,437
试试看没有他的生活
so we can give ourselves a chance without him.

981
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,520
结果你什么都不愿意试…
You're not giving anything a chance

982
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,234
继续翘班，跟他喝酒哈草
if you keep blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear.

983
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,190
你说得对
You're right.

984
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,980
我哈太多草了，我知道
l've been getting stoned too much. l know that.

985
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,400
我太常和泰德鬼混了，我也知道
l've been bumming around with Ted too much. l know that, too.

986
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,787
再给我一次机会，我保证我会改
You give me one more chance, l promise l can fix it.

987
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,450
强，我需要一个男人
而不是爱熊熊的男孩
John, l need a man. Not a little boy with a teddy bear.

988
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,795
我知道了
男人，就在你面前
l know, done. Man. Right here, in front of you, all right?

989
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,460
你看我的胸肌，这是男人的胸肌
Look at these pecs. These are man pecs.

990
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,000
看我的胡子，男人的胡子
Look at the hair on my upper lip. That's man hair.

991
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,095
我刚才放了屁，男人的响屁
l just farted. That was a man fart.

992
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:49,648
强，我发誓这是你最后的机会
Fine, John, but this is, l swear to God, your last chance.

993
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,441
相信我，我爱你
Trust me. l love you.

994
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,060
我也爱你
All right, l love you.

995
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,612
我很爱你，我保证，不再害你难过
l love you so much. You won't be sorry, l swear.

996
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,730
你刚刚真的放屁？
Did you really just fart?

997
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,075
但我把屁往那边扇
Yeah, but l pushed it that way with my hand.

998
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,700
我很好奇谁会先闻到
l wonder who it's going to hit first.

999
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,621
我告诉过他了，我告诉他好几次了…
So, if l told him once, l told him a million times

1000
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,541
这些数字兜不起来
these numbers do not add up.

1001
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,540
谁放屁？
Who did this to us?

1002
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,130
靠北，我在这里办正事耶
God damn it! I'm here on business!

1003
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,844
我们走吧
All right, here we go.

1004
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,510
很高兴你陪我来
I'm really glad that you came.

1005
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,840
我也很高兴
Me, too. Yeah?

1006
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,970
我可以扁你老板吗？
ls it okay if l kick your boss's ass?

1007
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,020
不会影响你和他的职场关系吧？
That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it?

1008
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,680
请有礼貌
Please play nice.

1009
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,930
好吧，为了你
For you, l will.

1010
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,567
谢谢 -没问题
Thank you. Anything.

1011
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,900
你来了，我还担心你不来
There she is. l was worried you weren't coming.

1012
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,491
好小子，你也来了，你的邦妮兔呢？
Hey, squirt, how you doing? Where's your bunny rabbit?

1013
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,951
他是熊
He's a bear.

1014
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,410
了
天哪！这房子有够大！
Got it. Oh, my God! This house is fucking huge!

1015
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,999
小心别迷路，请进！
l know. Try not to get lost. Come on in.

1016
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,512
到处都是美女
Wow! Here are the ladies.

1017
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,515
看看你们，这么正！
Look at you guys. You guys look amazing.

1018
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,726
眼妆重了点，但还是很靓
A little heavy on the eye makeup, but pretty good.

1019
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,930
谢谢，雷克斯
Thank you, Rex. Thank you.

1020
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,229
认识洛莉和吉姆吧，喔不，是强
You guys know Lori and Jim, right?
John.

1021
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,648
大家还记得强吧
- You guys remember John. - Hi.

1022
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,902
强何不跟我去吧台喝一杯呢
Listen, why don't John and l go get a drink at the bar?

1023
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,570
去吧
Sure.

1024
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,239
太好了，我们马上回来，来吧
Great, we'll be right back. Come on, buddy.

1025
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,451
这是旧毛衣吗？
lt's an old sweater, huh?

1026
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,994
这宅邸真是不可思议
This house is unbelievable.

1027
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,204
你没来过吗
Haven't you been here before?

1028
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,288
怎么说
What do you mean?

1029
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,624
就是 你和雷克斯...
You know, when you and Rex were. . .

1030
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,542
哦 没有 那都是上班时候
Oh, no. That was at work.

1031
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,753
你们就直接在办公室里？
You guys did it in the office?

1032
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,505
嗯   -什么地方
Yeah. Where?

男厕

我的天
Oh, my God.

1035
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,468
很奇怪吗 那你呢
Why? Where did you sleep with him?

1036
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,262
这里
Here.

1037

哦
Oh.

1038
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,682
不好意思
Sorry.

1039
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,059
我们是在残障间
lt was in the handicapped stall,

1040
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,271
比普通间舒适
so it was nicer than the regular stalls.

1041
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,850
柏格司的签名球棒
This is Wade Boggs' autographed bat.

1042
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,560
唐纳修开的价码刚好差我一点
l just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.

1043
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,690
不赖嘛
Wow, cool.

1044
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,698
当然
Yeah, cool.

拳王乔·路易斯首赛戴的手套
These boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight.

1046
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,038
这是艺术品，懂吗？
This is art. Get it?

1047
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,459
约翰蓝侬的眼镜
These were John Lennon's glasses.

1048
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,410
大约价值一百万
They're worth, like, a million dollars.

1049
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,088
你看，我和史基瑞
That's me and Tom Skerritt.

1050
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,210
Oh.

这是蓝斯阿姆斯壮的蛋蛋
lt's Lance Armstrong's nut.

1053
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,012
我把它干燥冷冻，还镀了铜
l had it freeze-dried and bronzed.

1054
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,475
遇到人生低潮与困境
Every now and then when my life's
getting me down and things are tough,

1055
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,645
我就会来这里，看着这颗蛋蛋
l just come up here and l look at it.

1056
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,317
我就会发现，情况还不算糟
And it reminds me that things aren't so bad.

1057
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,150
有时你就像颗蛋蛋
Sometimes you feel like a nut.

1058
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,739
有时你就不像
Sometimes you don't.

1059
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,036
小强，老实告诉我
你和洛莉还好吧？
So, talk to me, Johnny Quest. How are things with you and Lori?

1060
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,663
很顺利，真的
Things are great, actually.

1061
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,040
那太好了
That's great. That is great.

1062
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,002
洛莉不希望我多嘴
You know, Lori would hate me for saying this,

1063
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,380
可是她会抱怨你在公司的行径
but she told me how you are at the office.

1064
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,173
身为绅士，我只想告诉你
And, as one gentleman to another, l just want to say

1065
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,634
我真希望你得肌肉萎缩症！
l really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.

1066
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,470
你一定要听我解释
l think l need to clear the air here a little.

1067
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,800
我不是一个严肃的老板
Yeah, I'm kind of a fun-time boss and what-not.

1068
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,729
听着，我对每个员工都这样
But, look, man, l do that with everybody at the office.

1069
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,022
虽然我是怪咖
I'm a kook.

1070
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,190
但我对你女朋友没有企图
l have no designs on your girlfriend.

1071
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,318
我们一起工作，如此而已
We work together, and that's it.

1072
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,698
你人真的不错，她很幸运
l think you're a great guy and she's a very lucky girl.

1073
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,110
这才像话
Well, that's good to hear.

1074
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,400
Yeah.

1075
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,538
不好意思
Excuse me.

1076
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,280
泰德
Hey, Ted.

1077
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,541
强，你在哪？你非来不可
Johnny, where are you? You got to get over here, man.

1078
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,660
干嘛？有事吗？
Why, what's going on?

1079
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,500
我和一票人临时在家开趴
Okay, so I'm having a little impromptu thing
with some people at my apartment.

1080
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,880
结果…山姆琼斯竟然来了
And, John, Sam Jones is here.

1081
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,216
什么？
What?

1082
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,344
山姆琼斯，飞侠哥顿在这里
Sam Jones. FIash-fucking-Gordon is here.

1083
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,512
屁啦！什么？
Holy shit! What?

1084
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,181
我朋友的侄子认识山姆琼斯啊
You remember l said my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones?

1085
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,680
他们来波士顿，你想谁跟着一起来？
山姆琼斯
My buddy's in town with his cousin,
and who do you think is with him? Sam Jones.

1086
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,187
山姆琼斯在这里，而且…
Sam Jones is here, and, John,

1087
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,023
他头发中分
his hair is parted down the middle.

1088
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,810
跟电影里面一模一样
Just like in the movie.

1089
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,310
对！马上过来
Yes. Get over here right now.

1090
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,730
靠，我不行！
Fuck, l can't!

1091
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,690
我跟洛莉在一起，我还在留校察看
I'm with Lori here. I'm already on probation.

1092
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,150
我去不了
l can't.

1093
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,579
强，飞侠哥顿对我们童年影响深远
John, Flash Gordon was the most important influence of our formative years.

1094
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,040
他教导我们是非善恶
He taught us right from wrong, good from evil.

1095
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,040
还把“演戏”升华到更高境界
And that the word "acting" apparently

1096
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,790
has an extremely broad definition.

1097
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,170
飞侠哥顿是我们友谊的象征
FIash Gordon is the symboI of our friendship, John.

1098
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,380
快来与我同乐
Come share this with me.

1099
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,630
等我
I'm coming.

1100
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,555
雷克斯，我要走了
Rex, l got to go.

1101
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,057
我半小时内就回来
I'll be back in 30 minutes, tops, okay?

1102
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,720
不要让洛莉发现，她不能知道我溜了
But Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know l was gone.

1103
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,930
只要你掩护我，以前的鸟事一笔勾销
lf you can cover for me, I'm cool with all that other shit.

1104
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,940
我会掩护你，她不会知道，我了的
l got your back on this. She won't know. l've been there.

1105
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,609
这是男人间的秘密
All right, this is one man to another.

1106
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,778
我不认识你，但我相信男人
l don't really know you, but I'm trusting you, as a man.

1107
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,940
我不是在开玩笑
This is serious.

1108
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,990
兄弟，男人之间的秘密
我会掩护你
Dude, one man to another. l got you on this.

1109
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,240
谢谢你，我马上回来
Thank you. I'll be back.

1110
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,780
我要搞你女朋友
I'm going to have sex with your girlfriend.

1111
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,240
强，感谢老天你来了
Johnny, thank Christ you made it.

1112
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,959
我只剩10分钟，飞侠哥顿人呢？
Dude, l got 10 minutes. Where's Flash Gordon?

1113
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,002
准备好啰
Okay, get ready.

1114
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,630
山姆，这就是我跟你提起的人
Hey, Sam, this is the guy l was telling you about.

1115
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,130
FIash!

1116
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,130
A-ah!

1117
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,470
Savior of the universe!

1118
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
FIash!

1119
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,150
A-ah!

1120
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,320
He'll save every one of us!

1121
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,870
Just a man with a man's courage

1122
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,080
He knows nothing but a man

1123
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,210
But he can never faiI

1124
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,340
No one but the pure in heart Can find the goIden graiI

1125
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,520
你好，幸会
How you doing? Good to meet you.

1126
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,029
感谢你拯救我们每一个人
l thank you for saving every one of us.

1127
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,190
不客气
Well, you're welcome.

1128
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,900
他当真的
He acknowledged it.

1129
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,200
我们来拼酒吧
Let's do some shots.

1130
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,240
跟你吗？
With you?

1131
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,410
天哪，太荣幸了！
Oh, my God, yes! Oh, my God, yes!

1132
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,530
开始吧！
Let's go!

1133
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,376
谢谢你，飞侠
Thanks, Flash.

1134
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,210
给你，我的朋友 -谢谢
There you go, my friend. Thank you.

1135
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,250
消灭冥王！
Death to Ming!

1136
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,920
Yes!

1137
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,260
你们超放得开
You know, you guys seem pretty cool.

1138
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,920
想更开心吗？
You like to party?

1139
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,550
Uh. . .

1140
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,680
可卡因吗？
Cocaine, right?

1141
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,560
少来了，别跟我说你没吸过
Come on, dudes. Don't tell me you never done it before.

1142
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,270
最近没吸
Not recently, no.

1143
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,180
我以为只有佛罗里达人会吸
l thought that was just for people in Florida.

1144
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,560
跟我来吧
You better follow me.

1145
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,776
来吧
Come on.

1146
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,570
强，偶好怕
Johnny, I'm frightened.

1147
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,040
让我们重温80年代的派对
We are going to party like the '80s.

1148
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,249
教导我们怎么做，飞侠
Show us how, Flash.

1149
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,584
很简单
lt's easy.

1150
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,120
我们只要上遍所有叫怡君的女孩
We just gotta nail a lot of girls named Stephanie.

1151
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,130
老天，强，我现在好精神
God, Johnny, l got so much energy.

1152
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,080
最好赶快做些蠢事
We better start doing stupid shit.

1153
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,119
如果真的想开餐厅…
Look, Johnny, if we're ever going to
get serious about opening a restaurant

1154
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,310
现在就要好好计划
we got to start planning it now.

1155
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,600
义式餐厅 -义式好
ltalian. ltalian, yes.

1156
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,350
星期二的特餐是？ -焗烤茄子
What's the special on Tuesdays? Eggplant parm.

1157
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,499
沙拉半价
Chopped salad, half price.

1158
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,730
毫无限制的空间
And it's a non-restricted place.

1159
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,690
什么鬼？ -人人都能来
Yeah. What do you mean? Anybody can come.

1160
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,190
当然 -犹太人也欢迎
Of course. Jews are welcome.

1161
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,520
干嘛排挤犹太人？ -我正是这么想
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they be?
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

1162
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,009
何必提到犹太人？ -我是提出邀请
Why even bring that up?
You don't bring it up, you just let them in.

1163
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,530
那干嘛提起？ -有吗？
Why mention it? No one will.

1164
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,678
我们干嘛说到犹太人？
Why are we talking about it?

1165
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,200
是你说的，我只是邀请他们加入
You're talking about it. I'm just saying, let them in.

1166
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,200
邀请他们加入 -正是
好耶 -赞
Let them in. Right. Okay. Exactly. Good.

1167
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,308
但谢绝墨西哥人
No Mexicans, though.

1168
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,160
90年代都这么唱
This is how everybody sang in the '90s.

1169
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,010
相信我，我可以的 -闭嘴
Trust me, l can do this. Shut up.

1170
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,312
让他试试 -随便啦
Let him try it, man.
All right, fuck it.

1171
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,140
加油！
Go, go, go!

1172
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,952
你这个王八蛋！
You son of a bitch!

1173
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:06,240
你不应该相信嗑了药的我
Well, you never should have trusted me. I'm on drugs.

1174
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,000
强，我有好点子
Hey, Johnny, l just had a great idea.

1175
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,500
我们先喝茫，然后在天桥朝下面车吐
Let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass.

1176
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,679
我声音哪像彼得葛里芬
Come on, l do not sound that much like Peter Griffin.

1177
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,760
90年代的曲子，都可以只用母音唱
You can do any '90s song with just vowels.

1178
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:38,528
AElOU
A-E-I-O-U

1179
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,283
我就说加菲猫的眼睛像一对奶子的
See? There, proof. Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits.

1180
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,367
真的耶
You were right.

1181
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,110
打穿这面墙，你才是真正的飞侠哥顿
lf you can punch through this wall, you really are Flash Gordon.

1182
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,410
要试试吗？ -我要打穿它
Are you going to do it?
I'm going to punch through it.

1183
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,870
山姆，快打！ -快打！
Come on, Sam, do it! Do it!

1184
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,870
天哪！
Oh, my God!

1185
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,620
他办到了！
Yes! He did it!

1186
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,080
你在搞啥咪碗糕？
What the hell you problem?

1187
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,880
你打穿我的墙，我也打穿你的！
You break my wall! l break you wall!

1188
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,265
打断他的手！
Break his arm off!

1189
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,220
我们要死了！我们要死了！
We're going to die. We're all going to die.

1190
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,727
别打了
Break this up, break this up.

1191
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,890
抓他！
Get him!

1192
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,899
你打烂我的墙！偶在这里住很久了！
You break my wall! This my home long time.

1193
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,776
你打烂我的墙，你这人渣！
You break my wall, you bastard men.

1194
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,235
对不起，这是意外
We're sorry, it was an accident, okay?

1195
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,946
偶在准备鸭肉晚餐，现在到处是灰
l try to make duck dinner, now plaster everywhere.

1196
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,860
冷静一下，我们好好谈谈
你叫什么名字？我是强
Chill out. Can we just talk about this? What's your name? I'm John.

1197
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,490
我叫王敏
My name is Wan Ming.

1198
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,820
冥？
Ming?

1199
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,663
你们要赔粉多钱修墙！
You pay many dollar for wall!

1200
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,530
垃圾，全都是垃圾！
This bullshit! This all bullshit!

1201
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,700
消灭冥王！
Death to Ming!

1202
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,440
强暴啊！
Rape!

1203
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,190
山姆，放他走
Sam, let him go.

1204
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,820
你们疯了，一群疯子！
You crazy! You crazy, man!

1205
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,700
我们走，詹姆斯法兰科
Come on, James Franco.

1206
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,960
赔我墙的钱！
You pay for wall!

1207
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,790
闪开，烂人！
Move, sucker!

1208
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,560
最爽的一晚！
Greatest night ever!

1209
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,610
Hey.

1210
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:52,950
Hey, Guy.

1211
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,580
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

1212
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,910
这是杰瑞，上次痛扁我的人
This is Jared. He's the guy who beat me up.

1213
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,545
我们恋爱了
And we're in love.

1214
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,710
搞了半天原来我是基佬
Turns out I'm gay, or whatever.

1215
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,550
真的不知道
l had no idea.

1216
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,920
杰瑞，我们再去喝几杯
Hey, Jared, let's go grab another one of these.

1217
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,600
强小子，感觉怎样？
How we doing, ace?

1218
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,390
开始退了吗？
You coming down?

1219
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,390
不太舒服
Yeah, l don't feel so good.

1220
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,520
再过几个小时就会好了
Give it a couple of hours. You'll be golden, Ponyboy.

1221
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,310
你需要赞安诺吗？
You want a Xanax?

1222
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,190
靠，天哪 -怎么了？
Holy shit. Oh, my God.
What?

1223
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,030
我要走了
l got to go.

1224
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,120
洛莉，我…
Lori, l. . .

1225
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,710
洛莉
Lori!

1226
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,880
洛莉，别走，拜托
Lori, wait, please.

1227
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,552
对不起，我错了
Look, I'm sorry, l messed up. . .

1228
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,590
强，你今晚就给我滚
John, l need you out of the apartment tonight.

1229
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,470
能不能… -车钥匙给我
Can l. . . Just give me the car keys.

1230
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,430
能听我解释吗？ -不用了
Can l please just explain? No.

1231
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,559
听着，我…
Look, l was. . .

1232
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,140
我浪费太多时间在你身上
l have given up a huge chunk of my life for you.

1233
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,930
我只想停留5分钟，然后飞侠哥顿…
l was going to stop in for like five minutes and then Flash Gordon. . .

1234
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,060
给我车钥匙
Just give me the car keys.

1235
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,700
洛莉
Lori.

1236
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,620
洛莉，求你别，我爱你
Lori, please, l love you.

1237
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:34,013
原来你在这里，我需要透透气
Johnny, there you are. l had to get some air.

1238
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,182
你同事还在沙发上…
That guy from your office is in there on the couch

1239
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,510
跟神似大人哥的男人摸来摸去
making out with that Van Wilder-looking guy.

1240
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,760
你他妈的，我不想跟你说话
You know what? Fuck you. l don't even want to talk to you.

1241
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,605
什么？
What?

1242
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,941
你知道发生什么事吗？
Do you know what just happened?

1243
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,480
你看不出来吗？我的人生毁了！
Do you have any clue? My fucking life just ended!

1244
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:51,780
冷静
她会回家看着BJ单身鸟日记
Come on. She'll go home,
she'll watch Bridget Jones- something-asshole.

1245
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,070
哭哭就没事了，你们明天就会合好
She'll have a good cry, she'll be fine. You'll talk to her tomorrow.

1246
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,827
上楼吧 -你有没有在听我说？
Come on upstairs. Are you even listening to me?

1247
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:58,120
你有没有用心在听？
Do you give any shred of a shit?

1248
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,832
当然有，强
Of course l do, Johnny.

1249
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,876
“一辈子的雷雷伙伴”，还记得吗？
"Thunder buddies for life," remember?

1250
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,545
天哪，洛莉说得对
Jesus! Lori was right.

1251
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,130
我早就不应该跟你鬼混
l should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago.

1252
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,174
跟你在一起，我不会有前途的
I'm never going to have a life with you around.

1253
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,719
我35岁还一无所成
I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere.

1254
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,306
我只会跟天杀的泰德熊哈草看电影
All l do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy-fucking-bear.

1255
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,970
还因为这样，失去我一生的真爱
Because of that, l just lost the love of my life.

1256
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,060
强，我…
Johnny, I'm. . .

1257
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,353
对不起
I'm sorry.

1258
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,890
我必须自立，我不能再见你
l gotta be on my own, Ted. l can't see you anymore.

1259
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,730
强，别走，听我说
John, wait. Listen.

1260
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,230
我爱你
l love you!

1261
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,884
我听到闲话，你…
So, word through the grapevine is that you're

1262
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,130
刚变回单身
newly solo.

1263
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,260
雷克斯，我工作很多，我要走了
Rex, l have a lot of work l need to get to.

1264
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,557
我有诺拉琼丝今晚表演的票
l have tickets to Norah Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight

1265
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,390
我希望你陪我去
and l would love it if you would go with me.

1266
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,680
我才分手一周，你就约我出去？
You're asking me out a week after l broke up with somebody?

1267
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,274
那我就说清楚讲明白吧
Look, I'm going to cut the shit, here.

1268
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,390
说吧
Please.

1269
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,904
这是你在这里工作以后
This is the first time that you've been single

1270
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,610
第一次回归单身
in all the years you've worked here.

1271
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,742
试着跟我约会一次
Just go out with me one time.

1272
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,740
如果你很痛苦，很讨厌…
And if you're miserable and you hate it

1273
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:06,582
我保证以后绝口不提这件事
then l promise l will never even hint at the subject again.

1274
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,620
拜托你
Please.

1275
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,294
雷克斯，我觉得这样不好
Rex, l don't think it's smart.

1276
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,463
我是混帐，我很清楚
I'm an asshole, l know that.

1277
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,590
我从高中就这样，这就是我
lt worked for me in high school,
and it's been a reflex ever since.

1278
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,210
洛莉，你大不了也就只是…
Lori, the worst that can happen

1279
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,930
出席一场有趣轻松的约会
is that you go on a fun, casual date

1280
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,099
给某个男孩一次机会
with a guy who just wants a chance

1281
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,602
让他证明他不是混蛋
to prove that he can be something more than a jerk.

1282
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,938
况且你条件很好
Plus, you are a huge catch.

1283
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,310
早该让人好好疼惜你
And it's about time someone treated you that way.

1284
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,528
别说了
Fuck it. Fine.

1285
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,822
这确实好过每天晚上哭着入眠
Fine. lt sure as hell beats crying myself to sleep every night.

1286
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,116
如果你以后肯放过我…
And if that means getting you off my back,

1287
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,534
也算是额外的好处
well, that's just a bonus.

1288
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,200
我8点接你
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

1289
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,330
强，是我
Johnny. lt's me.

1290
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,790
别烦我
Go away.

1291
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,840
强，开门，拜托，我想找你谈
Johnny, open the door, please, l want to talk.

1292
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,600
烦死了！我招谁惹谁！
Jesus Christ! What the fuck, man?

1293
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,980
对不起，强，我知道你很气
Sorry. Look, Johnny, l know you're pissed, all right?

1294
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,140
但听我说
But just listen to me for five seconds.

1295
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,520
我看到洛莉和雷克斯出门
l saw Lori leaving the apartment with Rex.

1296
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,487
什么？
What?

1297
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,988
这是真的，强，我想找她说话…
I'm serious, John. l went over to talk to her

1298
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,323
帮你说些好话
and maybe take some of the heat off you.

1299
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,610
但雷克斯来接她，要去露天音乐台
And there he was, picking her up.
They were going to the Hatch Shell.

1300
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,661
你真的很不可理喻，你不觉得吗？
You're fucking unbelievable, you know that?

1301
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,330
你当我是笨蛋吗？
How stupid do you think l am?

1302
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,831
你以为编造这种鸟故事…
lf you think that by making shit like that up

1303
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,917
我就会站在你这边吗？
you're going to make me choose some kind of loyalty to you

1304
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,085
你根本是疯了
over her you're out of your fucking mind.

1305
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,420
这是真的，我没骗你
Johnny, it's the truth, I'm telling you.

1306
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,500
我告诉你，你给我滚
You know what? Get out of here.

1307
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,880
你很鸡掰，你知道吗？
You know what? You're acting like a cock. You know that?

1308
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,460
什么？我鸡掰？
What? I'm acting like a cock?

1309
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,512
没错
Yes, you are.

1310
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,630
闭上你的香肠嘴听我说
So shut your meat hole for a second and listen to me.

1311
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,340
香肠嘴？
Huh? Meat hole? What?

1312
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,970
好像不太对齁？
That's not right, is it? No.

1313
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,890
“布丁嘴”？会好一点吗？
"Pudding hole"? ls that what they say?

1314
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,060
好像也不对
No, it can't be that either.

1315
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,560
不是有一句话…“不吃肉，就没有布丁”
Because, "How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?"

1316
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,900
没说错吧？ 平克佛洛伊德的歌
Right? Pink Floyd.

1317
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:00,822
问题是你把自己做的事来怪我
Look, the point is, you're blaming me
for something that you did to yourself.

1318
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,610
洛莉说的对
Lori was right about you.

1319
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,400
你对人生的一切没有担当
You cannot take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.

1320
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,537
难道你就有？
Oh, and you can?

1321
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,950
我不需要有担当，我只是只泰迪熊
l don't have to. I'm a fucking teddy bear.

1322
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,580
我没有绑住你，拖你去派对
You know something? l didn't tie you up and drag you to that party.

1323
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,546
我希望你来，因为你是我最好的朋友
l wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.

1324
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,797
你没有资格站在那边说我…
You can't stand there and tell me

1325
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,715
你不是觉得洛莉老想破坏我们的友谊
that you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship.

1326
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,300
你当然无所谓
lt works out so much better for you

1327
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,170
我们可以在沙发哈草到早上9点
when you and l are getting fucked up
on the couch at 9:00 A.M. , doesn't it?

1328
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,550
你在说什么？
Listen to yourself.

1329
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,260
我是谁？我是冥王在控制你吗？
What am l? Emperor Ming, here, controlling your mind?

1330
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,010
那都是你的选择
That's your choice, John.

1331
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,640
你一直怪我，只会让你更孬而已
And by blaming me, you, you're just
making yourself look like a pussy.

1332
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:39,068
我常想到8岁圣诞节的那天早上
Sometimes l think back to that Christmas morning
when l was eight years old.

1333
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,060
真希望我拿到的是叭叭熊
l wish l had just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.

1334
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,190
你有种再说一次
Say that one more time.

1335
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,490
X你娘的叭叭熊！
Teddy Rux-fucking-pin!

1336
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,850
靠！
Shit!

1337
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,180
搞屁啊！
Fuck, man!

1338
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,730
妈的！智障！
Ow! Fuck! Cocksucker!

1339
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,780
停啦！我靠！
Fucking stop! Fuck!

1340
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,210
你哭什么？
Why are you crying?

1341
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:24,170
电视压到我的小弟弟
My dick is squished by the TV.

1342
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,850
对不起
I'm so sorry, Johnny.

1343
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,510
我也是
So am l, man.

1344
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,520
我爱你
l love you.

1345
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,180
我也爱你
l love you, too.

1346
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,020
听着
Listen.

1347
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,940
你必须让我帮你，让你们和好
You got to let me help you make things right with you and Lori.

1348
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,860
不可能和好了，她恨死我了
There's no putting things right. She fucking hates me.

1349
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:53,035
不，我们可以把她找回来
No, John. We can get her back.

1350
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Look,

1351
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,280
还记得10岁的时候…
you remember when you were 10,

1352
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,080
你拿bb枪射松鼠的事吗？
and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun?

1353
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:04,080
当松鼠从树上摔下来，我们都哭了
And then when we saw it fall from the tree,
we both started crying, you remember?

1354
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,548
我们奔向松鼠…
And then we ran up to it

1355
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:09,880
试着做人工呼吸，它又活过来了
and we tried to give it CPR, and it came back to life.

1356
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,887
强，我们可以再次救活你的爱情
John, we could do that again.

1357
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,010
泰德…
Ted,

1358
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,766
它的肋骨被我们压断，肺也被吹爆了
we crushed its ribcage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR.

1359
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,100
它马上就死了
lt died.

1360
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,350
别这样
我们要去露天音乐台
Come on. We're going to the Hatch Shell.

1361
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,360
谢谢，我们休息片刻，马上回来
Thanks. We're going to take a short break, but we'll be back in a few.

1362
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,210
弹筷子曲，爵士小骚货
Play Chopsticks, you jazzy slut.

1363
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,045
泰德！
Teddy!

1364
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:27,380
好久不见
How are you?

1365
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,173
好久不见，你这个绒毛王八蛋
How are you doing, you fuzzy little asshole?

1366
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,217
虽然我不是半个穆斯林的辣妹
Well, I'm not a hot, half-Muslim chick

1367
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,960
唱片也没大卖，但过得还不错
who sold 37 million records, but I'm hanging in there.

1368
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,971
是半个印度人，但谢谢夸奖
Half-lndian, but thanks.

1369
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,130
随便啦，也要谢谢911
Yeah, whatever. Thanks for 9/11.

1370
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,183
方便见我的麻吉吗？
Listen, l want you to meet a good pal of mine, all right?

1371
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,018
强班奈特，诺拉琼丝
John Bennett, Norah Jones.

1372
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,686
你好，诺拉琼斯
Hi, Norah Jones.

1373
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,970
你好，手这么湿
Hey, there, sweaty.

1374
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:47,817
准备好惊艳全场了吗？
You ready to bring down the house?

1375
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,150
准备好了，谢谢你给我机会
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Miss. . .

1376
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,230
琼丝小姐，谢谢你
Ma'am Jones. Thank you.

1377
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,980
天哪，你超辣的！
Jesus, you look fantastic.

1378
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,530
你还不习惯看我穿着衣服吧
Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed.

1379
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:01,579
那件事吗？
2002年我和诺拉在一次慈善活动中邂逅
l know, l mean, me and Norah met back in 2002 at this event for

1380
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,498
我们都有参与
this charity that we were both involved with.

1381
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,626
非常棒  资助对象是受家人性侵的孩子
This wonderful charity, actually, for kids
who'd been fucked by a family member.

1382
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,003
然后我们在衣帽间有场毛茸茸的性爱
And we. . . We ended up hooking up in the back room.

1383
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,090
老实说，没屌能有这种表现算不错了
Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis.

1384
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,427
说到屌，我写过不少抱怨信给孩之宝
You know, l have written so many angry letters to Hasbro about that.

1385
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,220
谢谢你们
Thank you.

1386
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,720
我的嘴巴要休息一下，换我朋友上台
Now, I'm going to give my chops a rest
and bring a friend up to the stage.

1387
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,978
他要唱一首歌
He's going to sing a song to a special lady

1388
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,270
献给他深爱的一位女观众
in the audience who he loves very much.

1389
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:29,350
请大家给强班奈特热情的掌声
Please give a big hand to John Bennett.

1390
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,610
天哪！
Oh, my God.

1391
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,570
搞什么？
Holy shit!

1392
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,120
我要再跟她搞一次
l gotta fuck her again.

1393
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,950
大家好，我叫强班奈特
Hi, my name is John Bennett,

1394
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,290
这首歌要献给洛莉柯林斯
and this is for Lori Collins.

1395
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,460
因为我爱你
Because l love you.

1396
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:56,800
这首歌总是让我想起…
我一生最重要的一晚
This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life.

1397
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,470
我们相遇的那晚
The night we met.

1398
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:03,470
这是八爪女的电影主题曲
This is the theme song from the movie Octopussy.

1399
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:14,810
我不过想要甜蜜的消遣
一小时、两小时都好
All I wanted was a sweet distraction For an hour or two

1400
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:20,070
根本没打算做什么
Had no intention to do

1401
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,280
还是比凯蒂佩芮好听
Still better than Katy Perry.

1402
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:30,000
爱情很奇妙
Funny how it always goes with love

1403
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:33,710
你不寻觅，反而觅得真爱
When you don't look, you find

1404
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:37,800
我们天生一对
But then we're two of a kind

1405
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,010
我们心契神合
We move as one

1406
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,010
我们总是爱到深处
We're an all time high

1407
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,645
难听死了，滚下台！
You suck, get off the stage!

1408
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,350
大家再给他一次机会
Come on. Give him a chance.

1409
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,940
我们不只…
Doing so much more

1410
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,230
你这混帐！
You're an asshole!

1411
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,110
坠入…
Than falling...

1412
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:03,740
天哪！
Oh, Jesus!

1413
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,990
叫救护车
Someone call an ambulance!

1414
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,925
他疯了
That was insane.

1415
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,885
你有看到那个人倒在地上吧
Did you see the way the guy's body hit the ground?

1416
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,670
垂直落地
He was like a ragdoll.

1417
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,973
我不想谈这个
Yeah, l'd rather just not talk about it.

1418
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,641
等会想去喝一杯吗？
Do you want to go get a drink after this?

1419
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,644
看到有人差点死掉，喝些酒会比较好
l feel like l could use one after seeing a guy almost die.

1420
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,564
我宁愿你送我回家
No, l think l'd rather just have you take me home.

1421
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,566
就一杯，走啦
One drink. Come on.

1422
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,568
我没有心情
No, not really feeling up to it.

1423
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:37,486
我懂了
All right, l get it.

1424
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,573
我不会怪你的
And, you know, l don't blame you.

1425
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,241
我只要想到…
l mean, when you think about it,

1426
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,660
他这么过分，那样丢你的脸
it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that.

1427
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,330
老实说，我不觉得丢脸
Just to be clear, I'm not embarrassed.

1428
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,540
我和他可能不适合，但至少他努力过
Listen, John and l may have our problems, but at least he tried.

1429
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,710
我不想跟你谈这个
You know what? l don't feel like talking to you about this.

1430
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:59,290
你去哪里？
Where are you going?

1431
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,179
搭计程车，我要回家
Taking a cab. I'm going home.

1432
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,140
总算可以放了
Finally.

1433
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,404
在下面
Down here.

1434
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,156
我没有偷看喔，我发誓
Not looking up your towel. Swear to God.

1435
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,820
我没有偷看，我没有偷看你那里
Not looking up your towel. Not looking at your funny business.

1436
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,610
泰德，你来做什么？
Ted, what are you doing here?

1437
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,780
我必须找你谈谈
l need to talk to you.

1438
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,956
如果你想替强说话，那就免了…
Listen, if you're here to fight John's battles for him. . .

1439
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:35,290
先听我说好吗？然后你想说什么都行
Look, just let me talk first, all right?
And then you can say whatever you want.

1440
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,260
听着，强很爱很爱你…
Look, John loves you very much,

1441
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,970
胜过世上的一切
more than anything in the world,

1442
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,010
他没有你，都快不成人形了
and he's falling to fucking pieces without you.

1443
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,351
他知道他犯了大错
He knows he screwed up huge

1444
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,970
但你必须相信我，这不是他的错
but you've got to believe me, it wasn't all his fault.

1445
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:57,816
那晚在雷克斯家，是我怂恿他离开的
他有拒绝我
l told him to bail on you that night at Rex's and he said, "No."

1446
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:02,029
他本来想陪着你，是我怂恿他的
He said "no," he was going to stay there with you, and l twisted his arm, Lori.

1447
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,400
如果你愿意给他机会…
So, if you just give him one more chance

1448
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:08,240
我保证我会离开，永远不回来
l promise l will leave and I'll never come back.

1449
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,530
他完全属于你
All right? He'll be all yours.

1450
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,450
泰德，这条件很好
Ted, that's a really nice offer,

1451
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:15,830
但我不希望你这么做
but l don't want you to do that.

1452
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,964
这是我和强的问题
我不认为这可以解决问题
This is between John and me and l don't think it can be fixed.

1453
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,382
我就是问题
Yeah, because of me!

1454
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:24,802
洛莉，你希望他成熟一点
Look, Lori, you want him to be a man.

1455
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:29,130
但只要我在他身边，他就不会长大
But as long as he's got his teddy bear,
he's always going to be a boy.

1456
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,930
他正在查理小馆
He's waiting down at Charlie's right now.

1457
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:37,648
你下楼跟他聊聊…
So, if you go down there and just talk to him

1458
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,690
回来就不会看到我了
I'll be gone when you get back.

1459
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,900
永远
Forever.

1460
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:45,155
我相信…
And, you'll see,

1461
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,360
他永远不会害怕雷声了
he'll never be scared of thunder again.

1462
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:35,664
“米切洛超托斯卡，柳橙葡萄啤酒”
"Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit."

1463
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,160
天哪，美国要完蛋了
My God, America is imploding.

1464
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,250
嗨，泰德
Hi, Ted.

1465
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,920
惨了！
Fuck!

1466
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,440
洛莉，你…
Lori, what. . .

1467
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,990
Hey.

1468
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,360
你怎么会来这里？
What are you doing here?

1469
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,780
你要感谢泰德
You can thank Ted.

1470
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,660
我可以坐吗？
Should l sit?

1471
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,170
当然
Yeah, if you want.

1472
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,710
Okay.

1473
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,500
工作顺利吗？一切还好吗？
So, work's good? Everything good, there?

1474
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,170
工作很顺利
Yeah. Yeah, work's good.

1475
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,510
我想我们不要再闲扯了
l guess we can't make small talk all day, huh?

1476
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:41,520
如果你不介意，我就说我想说的
lf it's okay with you, l just want to say what l want to say.

1477
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:45,651
我可以说抱歉，说那是天大的误解
l could sit here and tell you I'm sorry,
it was a huge misunderstanding,

1478
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,278
我准备好改变，但…
and I'm ready to change,

1479
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,320
你应该不想听这种屁话
but l don't think you want to hear any of that crap.

1480
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,490
我不会逼你接受我
I'm not going to try to get you to take me back.

1481
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:54,868
何必呢？
Why would you?

1482
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,912
我4年来都不是称职的男朋友
l've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years.

1483
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,740
我配不上你
l don't deserve you.

1484
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:03,168
我没好好珍惜我们的感情，但…
l know l didn't take our relationship seriously but, Lori,

1485
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,160
我真的爱你更甚于一切
l do love you more than life itself.

1486
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,426
我只希望…我们能好聚好散
All l want is. . . l just want to end on good terms.

1487
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,885
我亏欠你的
l owe that to you.

1488
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,510
我希望你开心，你应该开心的
l want you to be happy. You deserve that.

1489
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:19,300
我只希望，我们还可以继续当朋友
And l just hope that maybe we can still be friends.

1490
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,930
谢谢你如此坦白
Thank you for being so honest.

1491
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,980
这都是我的真心话
That's pretty much it.

1492
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,860
谢谢你过来
Thanks for coming by.

1493
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,470
Whoa!

1494
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,068
你现在知道…
Yeah, as you can see

1495
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,570
其实你早就是我们的家人了
you've been a part of our family for quite some time.

1496
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,575
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1497
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:18,202
真的很特别
Yeah, it's kind of funny, actually.

1498
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,740
我家也有你们的照片
l got a lot of pictures of you guys at my house.

1499
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,740
他是我的吗，爸爸？
ls he all mine, Daddy?

1500
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:26,668
是的，小赢家
Yes, he is, my little winner. Yes, he is.

1501
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,087
泰德，你来的正巧
Ted, you've arrived at a lucky time.

1502
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,960
罗伯特的游戏时间快到了
lt's almost Robert's play hour.

1503
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,383
我猜你们应该没有PS3
Yeah, I'm guessing you guys don't have a PS3.

1504
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,510
你们家看起来只有木马吧
I'm guessing you're more of a "wooden horse with a wig" kind of family.

1505
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,847
对…
Yeah.

1506
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,890
不对…对…不对…
No. Yeah. No.

1507
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,430
对…
Yeah.

1508
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,940
果然有木马
Yeah, see, there's the guy.

1509
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:55,730
泰德，你现在是罗伯特的了 听他的话
Now, Ted, you belong to Robert now, okay? You do as he says.

1510
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,900
你们以为绑架无罪吗？
You think you're just going to get away with a kidnapping?

1511
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,368
好个他妈的榜样…
That's a nice fucking example you're setting. . .

1512
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,610
别说脏话！
Language!

1513
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,121
对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

1514
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,410
泰德，我小时候…
You know, Ted, when l was a little boy,

1515
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,710
看见你上电视
l saw you on television.

1516
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:19,090
我没见过像你这么神奇美妙的东西 从来没有
And l thought you were the most amazing,
most wonderful thing l'd ever seen. Ever.

1517
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:24,726
我问爸爸 我可不可以也有一只神奇的小泰迪熊
And l asked my dad if l could have a magical little teddy bear, too.

1518
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,390
他说“不可以”
And he said, "No."

1519
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,970
剩下的可以直接EMAlL给我吗？
Can you just email me the rest of this story?

1520
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,390
我心碎了
And l was so heartbroken.

1521
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,900
我跟自己发誓，哪天我有儿子
And l promised myself that if l ever had a son,

1522
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:40,409
我绝对不跟他说不
l would never, ever, ever say no to him.

1523
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,570
绝对不会
Ever.

1524
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,415
他该跟巧克力棒说不的
Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in a while wouldn't hurt.

1525
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,830
我和泰德要变成最好的朋友，爸
Me and Ted are going to be best friends, Daddy.

1526
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:52,370
是啊，我的小松鼠
Yes, you are, my little chipmunk.

1527
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,630
玩得开心点
Happy playtime.

1528
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,597
他妈的见鬼了！
Jesus fucking Christ!

1529
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,880
我说过一次脏话
l said a bad word one time.

1530
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,300
我爸就处罚我
Daddy punished me for it.

1531
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,640
故事很棒，仿佛身历其境
That's a great story. l felt like l was there.

1532
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,640
他打得我哇哇叫
Daddy gave me an ouch.

1533
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,640
我现在也要让你嗷嗷叫
Now, l have to give you an ouch.

1534
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,949
孩子，你赢了，我听你的
All right, kid, you win. We'll do it your way.

1535
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,618
你想玩什么？想玩游戏吗？
What do you want to do? You want to play a game?

1536
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,200
现在是游戏时间吧？我们来玩吧
lt's playtime, right? We'll play a game.

1537
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,121
我想玩游戏
Yeah, l want to play a game.

1538
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,330
我来想想看
Good, good. Let's see. How about we. . .

1539
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,208
来玩捉迷藏好不好？
How about we play a little game of hide and seek?

1540
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,750
我喜欢捉迷藏，我躲起来
l love hide and seek. I'll hide.

1541
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,005
等等
Now, hang on a sec, there.

1542
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:38,710
你爸没教你礼貌吗？
怎么样，死肥仔？
Your dad likes you to show good manners. Right, Tubby McFat-Fuck?

1543
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:40,886
好吧，你先躲
Okay. You hide first.

1544
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,012
乖
Great. Fantastic.

1545
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:45,680
数到一百再来找我，懂了吗？
Okay, now you count to 100, and then you try to find me, okay?

1546
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,800
Okay.

1547
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:51,020
玩游戏前需要洗手吗？
Do l need to wash my hands before l play this game?

1548
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,020
不用
这什么鬼问题，只要倒数
No. That's a weird fucking question. No, just start counting.

1549
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,230
1、2
One, two,

1550
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:03,575
3、4、5
three, four, five,

1551
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,360
6、7

1552
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,700
别偷看，否则你会得到小孩癌
No peeking, now, or you'll get kid cancer.

1553
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:12,501
8、9、10
. . .eight, nine, ten,

1554
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:16,290
11、12、13
eleven, twelve, thirteen. . .

1555
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,390
Ah!

1556
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,460
Hey.

1557
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,040
你自己走回家吗？
You walking home alone, huh?

1558
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,540
Yeah.

1559
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,050
要我载你一程吗？
Do you need a lift?

1560
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:46,470
我没差
Oh, I'm okay.

1561
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:49,300
我被强暴的话，就怪我的穿着吧
lf I get raped, it'll be my fault for what I'm wearing.

1562
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,390
强…
Listen, John.

1563
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,890
我也有话要跟你说
There's something that l need to say to you, too.

1564
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,868
“无来电显示”

1565
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,030
Hey. Hey.

1566
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,950
强，我希望…
John, l hope that. . .

1567
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,870
我不希望你以为…
Listen, l don't want you to think that. . .

1568
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,330
抱歉
Sorry.

1569
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:26,468
我希望我们能继续沟通，因为我想…
l want us to keep talking because l think that maybe. . .

1570
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:27,886
先接吧
Go ahead.

1571
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,721
不管你是谁，现在都不适合聊天
Whoever this is, it's not a good time.

1572
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,340
强，是我，听得到吗？
John, it's me. Can you hear me?

1573
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,010
泰德？待会再说
Ted? Listen, l got to call you back.

1574
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,060
强，别挂，我有麻烦了
No, John, don't hang up! I'm in trouble.

1575
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,720
什么意思？什么麻烦？
What do you mean? What kind of trouble?

1576
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,856
他们抓到我了，公园那个怪人
They got me. That freaky guy from the park,

1577
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:43,068
另一个可能是他儿子，也可能是爱人
and that kid who l think is his son,
but may also be his lover, l don't know.

1578
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,560
等一下，说慢点，你在哪里？
Whoa, whoa, slow down. Where are you?

1579
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,360
我不确定，这…
I'm not sure, it's. . .

1580
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,570
喂？强…
Hello? Hello, John?

1581
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:52,990
喂？
Hello?

1582
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,248
你不是很有礼貌的客人喔
You're not a very polite guest, are you?

1583
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,415
干！
Shit!

1584
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:59,709
泰德，喂？泰德？
Ted, hello? Ted?

1585
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:01,250
怎么了？他没事吧？
What's the matter? ls he okay?

1586
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,420
我不清楚 -他在哪里？
l don't know. Where is he?

1587
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,290
我不知道，他只说他有麻烦了
l don't know. He just said he was in trouble.

1588
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,425
你能回拨吗？
Can you call him back?

1589
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,800
没有来电显示
No, it's blocked.

1590
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,050
我想到了
Wait a second.

1591
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,050
走哥伦布街，转哈洛街，上高架
Go. Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway.

1592
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,440
你让我们心酸
You put us in quite a pickle here.

1593
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,109
我们得走了
We have to go now.

1594
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,652
好主意
Yeah. Good idea.

1595

我们用了太多泰迪熊聊以自慰

走开，苏珊大婶！

1615
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:33,947

我就看你有多熟这些路
Let's see how well you know these streets.

1623
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,610
他呢？
Where is he?

1624
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,550
不会吧
Jesus!

你不能带走我的泰迪熊！
You can't have my teddy bear!

1629
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,320
挖靠！

一定要好好痛扁那个小孩
Somebody had to go Joan Crawford on that kid.
