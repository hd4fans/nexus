1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,647
What's your resolution?

2
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:19,733
- I'm going to cut carbs.
- Aren't you Mexican?

3
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,527
You can't eat nothin' Grandma makes.

4
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:23,487
It only takes 30 days to form a habit

5
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,490
and then it becomes second nature.

6
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:28,617
- Who says that?
- Oprah.

7
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,454
OK. Oprah cool now?

8
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:34,123
What's yours?

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,999
I want to quit selling trees.

10
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,098
- Why are we still here?
- I don't know. . .

11
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,684
Look at that man taking pictures and shit.

12
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,114
Sit down! Shut the fuck up!

13
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:13,370
- Hey!

00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,122

16
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,797
- Come on, man.
- Come on now, y'all!

17
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,553
- Really?
- Bitch-ass nigger, huh?

18
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,597
Bitch-ass nigger, aren't ya?

19
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:48,655
Hey, that's hella fucked up!

20
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:51,992
That's fucked up!

21
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:59,208
Let him go! What the fuck?

22
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,683
Hold up, hold up.

23
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:20,854
Fuck, Sophina.I've been holding, how long?

24
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:24,900
I don't know.

25
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,237
Every time you touch me,

26
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:31,865
all I can think about is
how you was touching that bitch.

27
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,202
I'll never hear the end of that shit.

28
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,670
You know what?

29
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,633
You're right. Go.

30
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:55,430
What I gotta do? Hm?

31
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,724
Fucked with her that one time.

32
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:05,274
Nah. You got caught. . . one time.

33
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,861
Are you gonna sit here and tell me

34
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:11,613
that was the first time
you kicked it with that bitch?

35
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,033
You ain't never seen her before that, huh?

36
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,998
That shit's over with.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,297
All I want is you. . . and T.

38
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:31,133
Forever.

39
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,473
What you mean, forever?

40
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,647
Let me show you.

41
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,868
Daddy?

42
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:03,582
- Go help.
- Mm-mm. She's asking for you.

43
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:17,387
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.

44
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,306
You can't sleep.

45
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,353
You want to sleep in here
with Mommy and Daddy?

46
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,647
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

47
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:31,360
T, you know better than that.
What time is it?

48
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,114
It's after midnight.

49
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:47,686
Mommy? Can I have
two fruit snacks today?

50
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,022
No, you can have
an extra apple if you want.

51
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,774
- But, Mommy. . .
- Don't argue with me, T.

52
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:54,526
It's too early.

53
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,711
- Oh, come on, we have to go get gas.
- We got enough to get us there.

54
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,019
Shh!

55
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:41,156
- Good morning, Tatiana.
- Good morning, Mrs. Stacy.

56
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:43,492
- How you doin' today, Oscar?
- I'm doing good, you?

57
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,333
See? Told you we'd make it.

58
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,007
You're gonna go home and sleep, right?

59
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:03,011
Nah, I'm gonna head up to the job.
Get some stuff for tonight.

60
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,222
I'd rather die than come here on my day off.

61
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,976
We're gonna go to 'Frisco, right?

62
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,104
See the fireworks?

63
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:18,693
Yeah. We'll do that.

64
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:22,197
- Cool.
- Cool.

65
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,534
All right, let me get in here.

66
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:31,706
Mm. . . The back
of your neck is all salty.

67
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,584

00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:46,740
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

73
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,491
this place would be a mess without me today.

74
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,329
OK. You still want me to pick up
a couple crabs for later, right?

Yes, and could you pick up

78
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:02,714
- Yeah.

79
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,056
All right, hold on.

84
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:33,036
Don't worry about that.

85
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,038
All right, then,
I'll pay you back tonight.

86
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,748
Come on, Ma. Don't trip.

87
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,833
You ain't payin' for nothin'
on your birthday.

88
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,919
OK, I need to run on in here, baby.

100
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:54,909

00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,989
What the fuck, man. It's fish.
You can fry all of it.

112

119
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:01,059
It's my day off.

120
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:09,734
Um. . . Well, I'm cooking for a friend
tonight before we go to the city,

121
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:13,738
and he loves fried fish,
like Southern style. . .

122
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:17,367
- Southern. Sounds like he's black.
- Oh, no, he's white.

123
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,787
But he knows a lot of black people, I guess.

124
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:22,664
Uh-huh.

125
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know what I got myself into.

126
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:45,937
- Hello?

127
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:48,273

129
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,444
- Yeah, Grandma.
- Bye.

130
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,237
No, no, no, Grandma.
It's my day off, all right?

131
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,532
- I'm shopping for the party tonight.
- Oh, l'm sorry, baby.

132
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,284
I thought you were playing on the phone.

133
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,953
Oh no, Grandma.

She wants to have a fish fry,
but she don't know how.

You think you can tell her
everything she needs to know?

136
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:10,003
Oh, no problem, baby.
What kind of fish does she want to fry?

137
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,671
Grandma, she don't know.

She don't know what kind
of fish she wants to fry?

Nah, Grandma, nah.

Put her on the phone.

147
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,456
Hope you found everything you need.

148
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,666
Yeah, I just want to talk to you
for a second.

149
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,377
It's a little nuts right now,holiday and all.

150
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,505
Look, I want to talk about my job.

00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:57,926
- The position's been filled.
- Look, look, Emi

152

Look, I really need this job, all right?

153
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,139
I was going through some shit before
trying to get back on my feet,

154
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,767
you feel me, but. . . I need this.

155

You can start me off with one shift
a week or whatever, I'll be here.

Work me 40 hours, only pay me for 20. . .

157
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,692
Dude, I hired somebody else.

158
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,530
For me to bring you back, that means
I have to let someone else go.

159
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,699
Someone who's never showed up late once.

160
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:24,369
I'm sorry, I like you, man. . .

161
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:27,789
I need this fuckin' job, bruh.

162
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,582
You want me sellin' dope, bruh?

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,084
Oscar. . .

164
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:33,711
You need me outside waiting
for you to get done, bruh?

165
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,588
You take care of yourself.

166
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,176
Hey!

167
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,807
I'm an expert now.

168
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:48,142
See you got everything you need.

169
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,395
I've got everything, thank you.

170
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:52,188
No problem.

171
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,566
- Here you go.
- Oh.

172
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,401

- Happy New Year.

175
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,408
- Emi was good.
- He put you back on?

176
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:06,286
- Starting next week.
- That's what's up.

177
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,329
Take it easy, man.
We celebrating tonight.

178
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,707
- Can you not be late?
- Don't even worry about that, man.

179
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,626
- Just answer your phone. Be safe, bruh.
- All right. Yep.

180
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,256

183
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:08,014
- I am.

184
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:10,516
- Yeah, did you?
- Yeah.

185
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:14,437
But I got some good news
and some bad news.

186
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,189
Gimme the bad news first.

187
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,192
I'm gonna need some help
with rent this month.

188
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,945
- How much?
- Like, 300.

But l can get you back

190
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,491
OK, so what's the good news?

191
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,411
- I'm doing overtime tonight.

192
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,373
l gotta do it. Plus, Moms understands.

193
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,292
But I need you to get her a card
for me and sign it, all right?

194
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,095
All right.

195
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:42,674
Osc, don't get me no fake-ass card with
no white people on it.I want a black card.

196
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,176
- All right, I got you.
- All right.

197
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,720
- I love you, all right?
- Love you too, screw up.

198
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,639
Whatever, bye.

199
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,572
What's up with it, Osc?

200
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,075
What's good with it, bruh?
My bad about last night.

201
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:10,660
Still trying to get that?

202
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,455
Hey, I'm not out that way though.
I'm gonna be in the town all day.

Gimme about an hour.

206
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,922
- All right, bet that.
- Bet.

207
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,827

Hey. . .

210
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:21,415
What's up, boy? What's up?

211
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,400
Hey! Hey! Hey, slow down!

What's up, bruh? It's all right, bruh.

216
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,301
It's all right.

217
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,136
It's all right, bruh.

218
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,391
It's all right, bruh. . .
You with me, bruh?

219
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:25,229
Come on, bruh. . .

220
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:27,481
Come on.

221
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,358
Somebody help!

222
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,934
Grant, come on.

223
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:50,856
All right, let me see
your hands. . . ears. . .

224
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,193
. . .your hair. . . inside your mouth.

225
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,778
All right, turn around.

226
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,698
Bend over, squat.

227
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:03,494
All right, you're good.

228
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:33,190
- Hey baby.
- Hey Mama.

229
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,739
Happy birthday.

230
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:42,491
What happened to your face?

231
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:47,079
You look nice today.

232
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,624
My girls came to see you last night?

233
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,878
- We played board games.
- I bet y'all let her win, too.

234
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,130
- Of course.
- Y'all hella weak for that.

235
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:57,715
She'll get no easy wins around me.

236
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,801
- Mm.
- What?

237
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:03,888
Remember that microwave popcorn
you bought a while back?

238
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:05,222
- Hella good.
- Yeah.

239
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,225
While I was putting it in the bowl,

240
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,395
Tatiana just standing there,staring up at me,

241
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:14,982
looking like she wanted something.

242
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,234
OK, then what? Come on, Ma.

243
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:21,155
She says, "Grandma,
do we have any dark butter?"

244
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:23,824
Dark. . . What's dark butter?

245
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:27,203
I'm thinking maybe she watched
Food Network or something.

246
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,164
I said, "Sweetheart, what's dark butter?"

247
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:34,251
And she said, "Well, when my daddy took me to see Wall-E,

248
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,128
he asked for light butter.

249
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:38,756
So now I want to try some dark butter this time."

250
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:42,426
- She too smart. . .
- This Moms right here?

251
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,346
- She a snitch, too?
- What the fuck you say about my moms?

252
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:48,099
- Fuck you and this bitch.
- Talking tough with these guards.

253
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,975
I'm gonna see your bitch-ass on the outside.

254
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:52,061
- Bitch-ass Palma Ceia nigger.
- Bitch-ass motherfucker.

255
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,396
- Oscar. . .
- Fuck DGF!

256
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,107
- Is there a problem in here?
- Oh, fuck you!

257
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:59,151
- Is there a problem here?
- No, we good.

258
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,279
Yeah, we good for now.

259
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,368
Yeah.

260
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,454
Yeah, fucked up. . .

261
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:17,461
Calm down.

262
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:19,880
Oscar.

263
00:24:22,884 --> 00:24:25,469
What happened to your face?

264
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,849
Dark butter. . .

265
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:33,352
She always listenin'.

266
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,688
Too damn smart for her own good.

267
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:38,858
Pre-school said, we should think about
starting her in school early. . .

268
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:41,610
Phina tell you that?

269
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,530
Yeah, we'll put her in private school.

270
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,325
Uniforms.

271
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,202
I was looking at Saint B the other day,

272
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,974
and they got this new thing where they start 'em off
speaking Spanish,then they put them back on English. . .

273
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:56,375
I'm not coming here anymore.

274
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:58,752
What?

275
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,006
I'm not coming here
for these visits anymore.

276
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:03,966
- This is my last time.
- I know, I know. . .

277
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:05,718
I know, this is
the last time for me, too.

278
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:07,178
I told you that.
I ain't going down no more.

279
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:11,432
You wanna keep putting Sophina through
this, then you go right ahead, OK?

280
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,560
But Tatiana? That baby
doesn't deserve this, Oscar.

281
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:16,770
She's too young to know what's going on.

282
00:25:16,938 --> 00:25:18,939
So I guess that's why
she asked me why you love

283
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:21,442
taking your vacations more
than you like being with her.

284
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,321
- She ain't say that.
- Oh, so I'm a liar now.

285
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,619
Ma, you got to tell her I love her.

286
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:35,247
- Tell her I . . .
- Tell her yourself.

287
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:37,374
The next time you call home,
you tell her yourself.

288
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,793
Or better yet,
let her come visit you here.

289
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,087
Yeah, but I . . .

290
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:46,926
She don't need to be exposed. . .

291
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:50,012
You already exposed her. . .

292
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,890
- You already exposed her to this.
- So what, you gonna leave me?

293
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:55,142
You gonna leave me again?
What kind of mom is you?

294
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,478
You gonna fuck around
and leave me in here?

295
00:25:57,646 --> 00:26:00,648
You ain't never had my fuckin' back anyway.

296
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:07,196
I'm in here by myself.

297
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:13,118
- I love you, Oscar.
- You don't love nothin'.

298
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:14,536
I do.

299
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:17,331
And I'm praying for you.

300
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,585
I'll see you when you get home.

301
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:24,964
Hey Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma?

302
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,132
Grant,back to the visiting area.

303
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,968
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck out of here!

304
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:32,596
Ma, I'm sorry! At least get a hug!
Ma, let me just get a hug!

305
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:35,182
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck off me!

306
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,851
Get the fuck off me!
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!

307
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:41,647
Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck off me!

308
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:43,482
Get the fuck off me, bruh!
Hey, Ma. . . !

309
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:38,787
Shit, bruh. I didn't think
we was ever going to hook up.

310
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,999
- What's good?
- I'm smooth.

311
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,084
I got good news
and bad news, though, my nig.

312
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:46,211
Don't tell me you ain't got it.

313
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:49,340
- Sold it to a white boy.
- For real? For how much?

314
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:51,675
Gave me a rack for it.

315
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:54,011
I wasn't gonna pay that high.

316
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,889
I still need it, though. What's good?

317
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,602
For the drive up?

318
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,395
Right on, Osc.

319
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,150
No, you're good, bruh.

320
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,028
- You sure?
- Take it.

321
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:13,197
Right on.

322
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:28,170
Burn one with your boy
right quick, though.

323
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:30,422
Nah, it's all you, bruh.

324
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,134
Right on, Osc.
All right, bruh. Be smooth.

325
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:36,095
Yeah.

326
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:13,465
Can you take me to my grandma's house
real quick to get changed?

327
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,050
Yeah.

328
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,262
What kind of cake you get?

329
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,013
Carrot cake.

330
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,765
Why you ain't get ice cream?

331
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,809
'Cause it ain't your birthday.

332
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:30,274
You know, it'd be hella easier
if you had your stuff at my spot, right?

333
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:32,818
Why don't you just move in?

334
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:36,530
Maybe when you stop blowing trees
in the car before we pick up T.

335
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,167
Can you roll down the window, please?

336
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:34,880
Hey T! T! Come here.

337
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,798
- Daddy!
- Hey, what's up, nugget?

338
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,343
Hey, what's up, girl?

339
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,388
How you doin'?

340
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:44,973
- Good.
- Good?

341
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:46,725
We played freeze tag today.

342
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:48,560
Really? Did you win?

343
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:52,272
- They couldn't catch me.
- Think you fast, huh?

344
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:56,777
Think you're faster than Daddy?

345
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:00,822
Mm. Really?

346
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,783
What's that?

347
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,868
Hey!

348
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,341
Undefeated! Undefeated!

349
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,264
You still haven't beaten me yet.
You know that, right?

350
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,725
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

351
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,228
- You're going to break this car!
- It'll be all right.

352
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:35,440
- It's already falling apart.
- I can't lose. Undefeated.

353
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,817
Daddy's 100 and 0.

354
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:38,986
Big, big, big cheater.
You're a cheater.

355
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,487
I didn't cheat.

356
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:42,197
How do you know if I cheated or not?

357
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,242
You were sitting in the car.
T, Mommy's a hater.

358
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,050
- Grandma?
- Yes?

359
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:04,469
Can you watch T tonight?
We want to go to 'Frisco.

360
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:06,638
Ask your sister.

361
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:08,432
But Rose got hella kids to watch.

362
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,395
But what's the difference
between watching six kids or watching seven kids?

363
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,999
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

364
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:38,295
Daddy had an accident at work.

365
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:43,175
How is work, by the way?

366
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,219
Work is. . . work.

367
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:57,272
I'll be back.

368
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,333
What you think?

369
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,629
It's cool.

370
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:23,674
Put a shirt on the bed
for you, if you want.

371
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:27,260
Right on.

372
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:35,268
Are you all right?

373
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:47,489
Osc. . . What's up?

374
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:51,535
Hm?

375
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,331
Fuck it. I lost my job.

376
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:04,297
For what?

377
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,383
Being late.

378
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:10,095
Last couple of days,
trying to get some money.

379
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:14,015
And they told you today? On your day off?

380
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:17,853
Can I keep it real?
They told me two weeks ago.

381
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:22,482
My bad, Phina.

382
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:27,320
I thought I was gonna get my job back. . .

383
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:30,449
You think life's a fucking joke?

384
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:32,075
You think you're gonna get fired

385
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,870
and somebody's gonna
give you your job back?

386
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,877
What? What game you running now, Osc?

387
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:44,588
You ain't shit, you know that?

388
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:47,549
You lie to me, you lie
to your fucking daughter. . .

389
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:51,344
I ain't had to tell your ass nothing.
Food on the table, the lights still on.

390
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:52,971
I could've kept getting it,
you wouldn't have known shit.

391
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,223
Oh, so you would've just kept faking?

392
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:58,810
And been out there bustin' knocks,
and doing whatever else,or whoever else. . .

393
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,437
You say you want the truth, right?

394
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:03,857
You ain't even tryin' to hear me.
You ain't even trying to hear it.

395
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:05,400
You ain't even listening to me.

396
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:09,946
Not after you lie for two weeks,
get cornered, and don't have a choice.

397
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:12,741
That's some pussy-ass shit.

398
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,911
What'd you do today? Huh?

399
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,914
I bet you sold that fucking zip.

400
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:20,749
I dumped that shit, Phina.

401
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,543
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

402
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:27,464
I'm tired.

403
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,343
Thought I could start over fresh, but. . .

404
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:34,304
. . .shit ain't workin' out.

405
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:49,528
You threw a whole zip of weed out
and you don't got a job?

406
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,744
I could slap you right now.

407
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,087
What are you gonna do?

408
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,758
Something legal.

409
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:17,138
Maybe if I could just
not fuck up for 30 days.

410
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:24,563
That's how long Oprah said
it takes to form a habit, right?

411
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,362
Look at me.

412
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,450
Don't make me have to go
through this shit alone, again.

413
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,056
Get this off. Take it off.

414
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:07,022
A distinct difference
between "Nah" and "Haa."

415
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:11,568
Yeah.

416
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:38,136
Hey, you guys are just in time!

417
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,846
Happy birthday!

418
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:41,598
Oh, you guys got me a cake, too?

419
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:45,143
- Yup. Happy birthday.
- Thank you, baby.

420
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:49,856
Smells good in here.

421
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,359
Here you go.

422
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:56,279
Look at you. . .

423
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:58,573
Hey Grandma.

424
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,450
What's smelling so good?

425
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:02,285
Oh, Osc. . .

426
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:05,246
Baby, you know I only needed two.
You didn't have to spend so much money.

427
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,415
Mama, you don't gotta worry about that.

428
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,751
- Oh. . .
- OK.

429
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:14,172
- What's up?
- We're up to no good. . .

430
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:19,260
- How you guys doing?
- How you doin', Oscar?

431
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,804
What's going on, Oscar?

432
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,681
- Nothin', hangin' out.
- Yeah?

433
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:24,849
Get some food. I'm hungry.

434
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,184
Uh-oh, what you got?

435
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:28,144
Mom's card.

436
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:31,940
Tay wanted me to go pick her up one.

437
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,025
- There you go.
- Appreciate that.

438
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:36,444
She's gonna flip out over this one.

439
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:40,198
- Oh, come on, now.
- That's Chantay there.

440
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:45,203
We got stuff comin' in.
You want to put it in. . .

441
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,790
You can't dump it!

442
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,626
No, that's what she told me when I was this size.

443
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,795
"You can't dump it!"

444
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,384
You know, T,when your daddy was your size,

445
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,262
just your age, he used to do this
with me and grandma.

446
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,725
Yes, he did, but he didn't do
it nearly as well as you're doing it.

447
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:11,354
No, he did not. I had to re-crack
everything he cracked.

448
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:15,817
Sophina, you are in love, honey.

449
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,737
- I am.
- 'Cause he was not a great try.

450
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:21,573
Who you think gonna win the Super Bowl?

451
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:23,408
- The Steelers.
- Steelers?

452
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:25,452
- Yeah, the Steelers. Yeah.
- What?

453
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,495
A Raiders fan cheerin' for the Steelers.

454
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,331
Yes, a Raiders fan cheerin' for the Steelers.

455
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:34,127
Black uniforms,
black players, black coach.

456
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:38,757
Coach even has a black wife.
I'm going for the Steelers.

457
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:40,341
You insane!

458
00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:43,011
I know I'm insane.
You know I'm insane?

459
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:46,056
- It's ready.
- All good!

460
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:47,474
You ain't goin' to serve us?

461
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,809
I didn't serve you your whole life, Cephus.

462
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:51,269
OK, get us somethin' to eat!

463
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,782
Doin' my food dance.

464
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:05,867
Where my table tray, Wanda?

465
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,828
I got your table tray
at your house, Daryl.

466
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,416
Oh, Cephus, that was you?

467
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:15,585
That was Cephus,you know that wasn't me. . .

468
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:20,090
I'm sorry, Daryl. I'm sorry.

469
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:24,052
Here you are, sweetheart. There you go.
You want a little more crab?

470
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,179
I'm good.

471
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:31,309
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

472
00:40:31,477 --> 00:40:34,562
- None of that.
- All right, you all.

473
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,607
All right, everybody.

474
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,442
Oh, Heavenly Father,

475
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,821
we thank you for having
our family together tonight.

476
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:48,326
We are blessed that Grandma Bonnie made her famous gumbo.

477
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:51,371
In your name, let's feast. Amen.

478
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:53,248
Amen.

479
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:04,425
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Best birthday present.

480
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,555
Thanks for your help tonight.

481
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:12,350
Come on, Mama.
You ain't got to thank me.

482
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:14,686
I shouldn't even be letting you do this.

483
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:18,106
Oh, please. It's relaxing.

484
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:20,483
Yeah, if you say so.

485
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:22,485
I say so.

486
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:28,825
You guys got plans for the night?

487
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:30,994
Yeah, nothing major though.

488
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:34,164
Meet up with the fellas,
head out to the city.

489
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:36,708
You guys going out, out? Or. . .

490
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,377
I think we're just gonna be low-key.

491
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:44,048
Catch the fireworks, probably
roll around a little bit after that.

492
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:45,717
Roll around?

493
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:49,095
It's gonna be cool, though.

494
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:52,557
Chill. Plus, Phina's gotta get up
and go to work in the morning anyway.

495
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,394
You guys gonna be drinking?

496
00:41:56,562 --> 00:41:57,598
Mama, they gonna be drinking.

497
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:02,984
I haven't had a drink since. . .
I can't even remember.

498
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:07,030
Why don't you take the train out there.

499
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:11,993
That way you guys can drink and hang out
and not have to worry about anything.

500
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,704
Nah, I feel like getting
over there and getting back.

501
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:18,166
- Not waiting on no train.
- No traffic, either.

502
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:20,960
You know? You know it's gonna be crazy,
going and coming back.

503
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:24,756
Yeah, we might take it.

504
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:29,802
Don't make me follow you guys to make sure.

505
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,763
Remember prom?

506
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:35,642
Trying to forget.

507
00:42:51,283 --> 00:42:53,159
We gotta go. We're gonna go, OK?

508
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:54,786
Honey, thank you.

509
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,288
You good?

510
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,707
- Let me get my stuff.
- Did you say goodbye?

511
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,459
Come here.

512
00:43:01,627 --> 00:43:05,421
- We're outta here.
- I love you.

513
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,508
- All right, now.
- Don't get up, don't get up.

514
00:43:08,676 --> 00:43:11,344
All right, so you going out.
All right, have fun.

515
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:13,054
Happy New Year.

516
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,806
All right, all right.

517
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:20,645
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

518
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:22,897
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, baby.

519
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,361
- Come here.
- Happy New Year.

520
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:30,655
Happy New Year.

521
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:01,102
Let's just call it a night.

522
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:03,938
I'm going out.

523
00:44:04,106 --> 00:44:08,067
I don't know what you're doing,
but I want to go into 'Frisco.

524
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:10,486
We can just watch
the countdown from the house.

525
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:13,239
Mm-mm.

526
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,576
Let's go out. I wanna have fun.

527
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:18,745
Get drunk.

528
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,749
All right.

529
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,792
- We'll go to the city.
- Yeah?

530
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,544
Yeah.

531
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:44,187
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

532
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:51,569
Oh no! You guys are so strong!

533
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:53,821
Hi, happy New Year.

534
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,868
Come on, Osc.
I just got them ready for bed.

535
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:03,748
That tickles! All right, you win!

536
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:06,459
Guys, let your uncle up. Come on.

537
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,294
- Let your uncle up.
- You win, you win!

538
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:11,547
Go to bed. Come on.

539
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:17,345
Ready to go brush those teeth?

540
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:19,305
- No.
- No?

541
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,808
'Cause if you don't,
your teeth is going to rot

542
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:24,018
and your breath's going
to start smelling like gumbo.

543
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:26,437
- You want that?
- Yes.

544
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:28,189
- No, you don't.
- Yes.

545
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:30,608
'Cause then the Gumbo Monster
will get you!

546
00:45:32,903 --> 00:45:35,780
Daddy!

547
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,245
Go on.

548
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:45,498
You had gumbo, too.

549
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,629
Get those chompers in the back.

550
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,600
Down low.

551
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,602
You almost got me.

552
00:46:10,357 --> 00:46:11,691
- Ouchie!
- Come on.

553
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:14,068
My feet hurt.

554
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,454
We're getting ready to take off, OK?

555
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:26,747
You guys aren't going to sleep over, too?

556
00:46:26,915 --> 00:46:28,541
We already promised our friends

557
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:30,668
we was going to kick it with them tonight.

558
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:33,921
But we'll be back before
you wake up though, OK?

559
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:38,092
No! Don't go.

560
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:43,222
I'm scared.

561
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,766
Scared of what?

562
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:48,936
I hear guns outside.

563
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:58,279
You know what, baby?
Those is firecrackers.

564
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:01,616
You're safe inside with your cousins.

565
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:03,701
What about you, Daddy?

566
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:05,786
Me?

567
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:09,123
Baby, I'm gonna be fine.

568
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,666
I'll tell you what, though.

569
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:13,711
When you wake up in the morning,
we're gonna play Candy Land.

570
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:15,838
And then guess what
we're gonna do after that.

571
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:19,592
- Go to the park?
- Better.

572
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,260
Toys"R"Us?

573
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:22,929
Way better than that.

574
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,680
Why?

575
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:28,684
I don't know, maybe. . . Chuck E. Cheese?

576
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,937
- Really?
- I promise.

577
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:34,315
Daddy's gonna give you hecka tokens
and we gonna play all the games, OK?

578
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:35,983
And then we're gonna get your favorite pizza,

579
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:37,735
and we'll eat it all up.

580
00:47:37,903 --> 00:47:40,696
Even Mommy's ,'cause she can't have carbs.

581
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,032
What's a carb?

582
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:48,496
You ain't got to worry
about that right now.

583
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:56,337
I love you.

584
00:47:57,464 --> 00:47:59,340
I love you, too, Daddy.

585
00:48:12,437 --> 00:48:15,398
- Sonja. . . Nigga, I passed. . .
- Mm-hm. That's two.

586
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:17,817
I passed her on to you.
I be putting you on her.

587
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:22,029
I can count all of mine on two hands.

588
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,864
Where the fuck is nigga Oscar at, bruh?

589
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:26,284
He came by the job earlier today.

590
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:28,202
- He's always late, bruh.
- Ah, damn, damn. . .

591
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,621
Fuckin' around with Sophina,always, bruh.

592
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:32,873
Damn, nigga.That's the downfall of man. . .

593
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,626
Bitch slowing a nigga down and shit.

00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,674

597
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,932
Of course, it was, man. She had to get

598
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,517
- You, what up, bruh?
- Late-ass, nigga. . .

599
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:54,020
Hey man, it ain't me!

600
00:48:54,187 --> 00:48:57,106
Osc, take a shot

601
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,738
Happy New Year's, motherfuckers.

602
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:06,240
Happy New Year to you, too.

603
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:08,534
I ain't got my ticket.

604
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:18,878
- Hey!

605
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:22,506
Come on, man. . .

606
00:49:22,674 --> 00:49:24,258
Hurry up, bruh.

607
00:49:25,636 --> 00:49:27,511
Doors close.

608
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,029
- Hi, happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

609
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,503
Make sure you keep your hands to yourself.

610
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:03,756
Did you know it's illegal
to smoke blacks on the BART.

611
00:50:03,924 --> 00:50:05,466
Is that right, Officer?

612
00:50:05,634 --> 00:50:07,843
We're gonna let y'all slide
'cause it's a holiday and all.

613
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:11,597
You thirsty? You guys good?

614
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:14,392
Right on, bruh. For sure.

615
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:16,811
I like your dreads.

616
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:21,315
Shit, I like your everything.
We need to put it together.

617
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:24,402
- Oh, we gay.
- No shit?

618
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:26,362
- Gay, huh?
- Sounds like a coincidence.

619
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,822
We gay, too.

620
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:30,074
You're not gay.

621
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:34,328
Hey Osc, bruh. Ain't we gay?

622
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:35,913
Yeah, they gay as fuck.

623
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:51,345
Approaching West Oakland Station.

624
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:55,015
Sorry folks,there's gonna be a slight delay.

625
00:50:57,936 --> 00:50:59,145
- We gonna make it.
- No, we're not.

626
00:50:59,312 --> 00:51:00,730
- Yeah, we are.
- What time is it?

627
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:02,440
- Stop being so negative.
- I'm not being negative.

628
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:03,899

Hey, do you gotta pee?
I gotta find somewhere to pee.

644
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:31,338
You just left the bathroom.

645
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,048
It's hella dirty in there,

- A young man right here.
- See? You are a gentleman.

649
00:53:45,145 --> 00:53:48,856
He's a gentleman.
That purse looks real good on you, too.

650
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:51,400
You look real good in that purse.

What's up, bruh?
You got a bathroom that we could use?

655
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:18,093
I'm all closed up, man.

656
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:20,387
And I don't even have
a bathroom for my customers.

657
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:23,432
But I'm sure you got a bathroom
for your employees, right?

00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,813
Say, bruh, I ain't rich at all,

Now, you can take this ten,
let them use the bathroom,

661
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:36,028
or you can go home.

662
00:54:36,196 --> 00:54:38,697
When you come back tomorrow,
there's gonna be hella piss here

663
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:41,700
'cause they ain't gonna pee
on themselves, you feelin' me?

664
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:45,412
For real?

665
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,207

Thank you.

669
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,848
Don't worry about it, man.
Happy New Year.

670
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:06,976
Happy New Year.

Please tell me this place has a bathroom.

672
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,249
What?

673
00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:34,086
She's pregnant.

674
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:37,172
- OK, come on.
- Thank you.

675
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,590

679
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:46,849
- Appreciate that.
- Yep.

680
00:55:47,017 --> 00:55:49,226
Thought she was gonna
have to go in the street.

681
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:51,228
We almost had the same problem.

682
00:55:58,361 --> 00:56:00,446
How long you guys been married?

683
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:05,325
Eight years.

684
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:12,166
You thinkin' about it?

685
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:17,087
What's stopping you?

686
00:56:18,715 --> 00:56:22,217
- No money.
- Ah, shitty reason.

687
00:56:24,095 --> 00:56:27,931
- We had nothing when we got married.
- No shit?

688
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,476
I wasn't working at all,and she's a teacher,

689
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:32,394
it's practically the same thing,
as far as money goes.

690
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:34,605
How'd you get a ring?

691
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,234
I stole it.

692
00:56:40,987 --> 00:56:44,782
Told you, I didn't have any money.
Used to be good with credit cards.

693
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:48,786
- I would not go down that road.
- No, bruh. I'm cool on that.

694
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:51,789
Seriously, but then
I got my business started,

695
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:54,166

697

- Put the fuckin' phone away.
- Get the fuck out of here, bruh.

784
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:52,065
Fuck these, niggas. This is bullshit.

785
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:53,608
- Cool, bruh?
- I'm good, I'm good.

786
01:02:53,776 --> 01:02:57,237
We're gonna be good. I'm good.

787
01:02:57,405 --> 01:02:59,239
- Shut up.
- Phina, what's up?

788
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:02,451
- Where you at? You still on the train?
- Hell no, we still at Fruitvale.

789
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:04,327
They holding us and beating on us and shit.

790
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:05,871
- Who the fuck is beating on you?
- The fuckin' police.

791
01:03:06,038 --> 01:03:07,831
- Get off your phone!
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

792
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:09,583
- I'll meet you back, OK?
- Osc!

793
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,501
- I love you.
- These bitch-ass police.

794
01:03:11,669 --> 01:03:14,296
It's cool, bruh.
I'm gonna get us up outta here.

795
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:16,381
- Sit down, sit down!
- Let me talk with you. . .

796
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:18,925
Sit the fuck down.

797
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,971
- Jesus. . .
- Hey, come on, man.

798
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:26,475
- Fuck this bullshit!
- Sit!

799
01:03:26,642 --> 01:03:29,144
It's cool. You know what, man?
We good, bruh. We good, bruh.

800
01:03:29,312 --> 01:03:30,645
They can hold us as long as they want,

801
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:32,522
but they can't arrest us
'cause we ain't do shit.

802
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,107
- What's that?
- I say we ain't do shit!

803
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:35,775
- Y'all can't fuckin' arrest us.
- Oh yeah?

804
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:37,652
Cuff these two assholes,
they're going to jail.

805
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,779
- Fuckin' what! You can't arrest us!
- How about that?

806
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:42,365
- Get on your knees.
- You can't fuckin' arrest me!

807
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:43,950
Knees, now!

808
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:46,244
I'm just tryin' to get home, bruh!

809
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:48,038
We ain't tryin' to go to jail,
you feel me?

810
01:03:48,206 --> 01:03:50,207
We just tryin' to get home.
We just tryin' to get home. . .

811
01:03:50,374 --> 01:03:51,791
Maybe you should've thought about that,

812
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,835
before you started acting like a punk-ass bitch.

813
01:03:54,003 --> 01:03:55,587
Don't call my partner no bitch.

814
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:58,673
You's a bitch-ass nigger, for real.

815
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:00,884
Did you call me a "bitch-ass nigger"?

816
01:04:01,052 --> 01:04:04,471
- Don't fuckin' say that.
- Bitch-ass nigger, huh?

817
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:09,059
What the fuck! I ain't do shit!

818
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:14,606
Fuck!

819
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,359
I can't get his fucking arm!

820
01:04:17,527 --> 01:04:19,819
- Roll over!
- You're on my head, man!

821
01:04:23,991 --> 01:04:25,992
Roll over!

822
01:04:43,177 --> 01:04:47,639
You fuckin'. . .
You fuckin' shot me, bruh.

823
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:49,516
You shot me. I got a daughter.

824
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:53,270
Get up, bruh!

825
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:56,273
- Get him out!
- He didn't do nothing!

826
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,942
- Go! Go!
- Oscar, get up, bruh!

827
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:02,279
Call an ambulance!
Man, he's dying, man!

828
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:04,531
Get this train out of here!

829
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:09,494
- Back up!
- What the fuck!

830
01:05:12,915 --> 01:05:14,749
Get out of here.

831
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:17,419
Get the train out of here, now!

832
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,421
Move!

833
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:23,425
Why isn't this train moving!

834
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:25,927
- What did you do?!
- Let's go!

835
01:05:26,095 --> 01:05:27,679
Get in there!

836
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:34,102
Shots fired, Fruitvale. Code 3.Stage fire and medical.

837
01:05:47,658 --> 01:05:49,492
What the fuck happened?

838
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,369
Huh?

839
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:04,841
Look at me. Can you look at me?

840
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:07,677
- He shot me.
- You stay right here.

841
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:10,764
Shot me. . . I got a. . . a daughter.

842
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:17,520
Keep your eyes open.

843
01:06:18,147 --> 01:06:20,106
Fuck.

844
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:23,818
Come on, talk.

845
01:06:30,493 --> 01:06:31,701
Sophina?

846
01:06:31,869 --> 01:06:33,411
The police, they got Oscar and them.

847
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:35,455
I heard something and I don't know
if it was a beanbag. . .

848
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:37,749
Sophina, honey, calm down.
I can't hear you.

849
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:40,251
- Is Oscar there with you?
- No, he's upstairs with the police.

850
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:42,337
But we're downstairs
and we're trying to get up to them,

851
01:06:42,505 --> 01:06:44,506
- and they're not letting us upstairs.
-  Did Oscar get arrested?

852
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:47,509
I don't know, but I think so, Wanda.

853
01:06:49,053 --> 01:06:51,680
OK, I'm gonna call you back.

854
01:06:51,847 --> 01:06:53,473
Who's that for?

855
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:55,016
- Sorry, who's that for?
- Stay back.

856
01:06:55,184 --> 01:06:57,519
Who's that for?
Who is that for?

857
01:06:57,687 --> 01:06:59,396
Why can't you tell me what is going on?

858
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:01,981
What is the problem?
Tell me what's going on?

859
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:05,777
Jason! Jason! What happened?
What happened!

860
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:07,445
- They fuckin' shot him!
- What happened?

861
01:07:07,613 --> 01:07:10,490
They shot Oscar in his fuckin' back
for no reason, man!

862
01:07:10,658 --> 01:07:14,994
Where is he?
Where is Oscar! Where is he?

863
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:18,331
Where is Oscar? Where is he!

864
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:20,583
What is going on?

865
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:22,293
Where is he?

866
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:33,304
Oscar, can you hear me?

867
01:07:33,472 --> 01:07:35,724
I have a daughter. . .

868
01:07:44,024 --> 01:07:46,568
Tape here. Bag him.

869
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:51,072
- Please. . .
- That's how you feel?

870
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,491
My boyfriend is. . .
My boyfriend is up there, OK?

871
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,493
You don't understand. Please. . .

872
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:57,787
Please, my boyfriend is up there, OK?

873
01:07:57,955 --> 01:08:01,583
- You need to let me up there.
- Y'all gonna shoot us too?

874
01:08:03,878 --> 01:08:05,336
- Wanda. . .
- Sophina. . .

875
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:08,131
Yeah, been trying to get up there,
and they're not letting me up.

876
01:08:08,299 --> 01:08:11,634
- Where's Oscar?
- Oh, my God. . . Oh, my God.

877
01:08:11,802 --> 01:08:13,261
What did you do to him?

878
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:16,222
Did you fucking kill him!
What did you do to him?

879
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:19,142
We have it, Carlos.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

880
01:08:20,978 --> 01:08:22,729
You're all right now.

881
01:08:24,648 --> 01:08:26,775
I need to make sure that he's OK!

882
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:28,860
That's my fucking baby's daddy right there!

883
01:08:29,028 --> 01:08:30,862
OK, I need to be next to him!

884
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,989
Where y'all taking him?

885
01:08:33,157 --> 01:08:35,366
- Where are you taking him?
- He's going to Highland.

886
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:37,327
Get off me!

887
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:18,743
Wanda, they shot Oscar.

888
01:09:18,911 --> 01:09:20,995
They say he's alive,
but his eyes was closed.

889
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:23,915
They're taking him to Highland,
you gotta come get us right now.

890
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,252
- I'm on my way.
- Oh, fuck.

891
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:28,795
What do you got for me?

892
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:31,506
Twenty-two year old male,
posterior scapula GSW.

893
01:09:31,674 --> 01:09:34,634
He was lying face-down when he was shot.
On three. One, two, three.

894
01:09:34,802 --> 01:09:36,427
- What was his blood pressure?
- Seventy systolic.

895
01:09:36,595 --> 01:09:39,138
- Was he moving his limbs?
- Yes. Moving arms and legs.

896
01:09:39,306 --> 01:09:42,058
I'm gonna need a chest tube.

897
01:09:42,226 --> 01:09:44,561
We gotta get him upstairs right away.

898
01:09:54,613 --> 01:09:57,282
Excuse me, my son is Oscar Julius Grant III .

899
01:09:57,449 --> 01:09:58,867
He's been shot and they told me to come here.

900
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:00,827
- G-R. . .
- A-N-T, yes.

901
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:03,538
OK, he's in surgery.
Go to the ICU room. . .

902
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:06,082
- And that is where?
- Right over there.

903
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,877
Oh Lord, please let him be safe.

904
01:10:10,754 --> 01:10:12,755
Get that blood in.

905
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:15,758
Scissors.

906
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,262
Suction.

907
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:41,492
Hey.

908
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,998
- Hey.
- Any news?

909
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:48,917
No, no news yet.

910
01:10:49,084 --> 01:10:53,004
- Motherfuckers. . .
- Hey, hey, hey.

911
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:55,089
Hey, no. Listen, none of that.

912
01:10:55,257 --> 01:10:58,259
None of that.
This is not the time or the place.

913
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,220
OK?

914
01:11:01,388 --> 01:11:03,306
Why ain't they said nothin' yet?

915
01:11:03,474 --> 01:11:04,974
We waitin'.

916
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:10,229
Come on.

917
01:11:10,397 --> 01:11:12,857
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

918
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:15,944
We gotta let these people do their jobs.

919
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:17,570
He's gonna be fine.

920
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:20,073
Let's put all our energy
towards Oscar right now.

921
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,576
I know y'all are upset,
but we got to lift him up.

922
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:28,831
Let's keep him lifted up.

923
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:32,126
- I don't know.
- It's OK.

924
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:34,379
- I feel, I feel weird. . .
- Come on man, calm down.

925
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:36,547
Y'all heard Mom.

926
01:11:40,094 --> 01:11:42,136
- Ms. Johnson?
- Yes?

927
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:45,264
- The doctor's going to speak to you.
- How is he?

928
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:48,810
Ms. Johnson, as you know,
your son's been shot.

929
01:11:48,978 --> 01:11:52,647
Now, we stabilized him,
but he's critical.

930
01:11:52,815 --> 01:11:54,857
Critical, what is that?

931
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:56,943
Well, he has massive internal bleeding,

932
01:11:57,111 --> 01:11:59,445
and we had to remove the right lung.

933
01:11:59,613 --> 01:12:03,449
His lung? How. . .
how's he going to be able to breathe?

934
01:12:03,617 --> 01:12:06,160
He's on a breathing machine right now.

935
01:12:06,328 --> 01:12:08,454
So, his breathing is stable.

936
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,748
The main problem is the internal bleeding.

937
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,625
Damn. . .

938
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:17,797
Now, we've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding,and getting his blood to clot.

939
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:20,842
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions yet.

940
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,553
But he's gonna make it, right?
He's gonna make it?

941
01:12:23,721 --> 01:12:26,389
I promise you we're going to do
everything possible. . .

942
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:30,727
Hey! Hey!

943
01:12:32,187 --> 01:12:34,147
- Please. . .
- We'll do what we can.

944
01:12:34,314 --> 01:12:36,441
Please do what you can.

945
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:38,901
Don't come back out here
without Osc, nigga.

946
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:41,738
Bring him out, man. Bring Osc out.

947
01:12:43,782 --> 01:12:45,575
We gotta lift him up, y'all.

948
01:12:45,743 --> 01:12:47,702
We got to lift Oscar up.

949
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:50,288
I can't even believe this,
man, we here, bruh.

950
01:12:50,456 --> 01:12:52,165
- I know.
- I can't believe this.

951
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:54,000
Y'all know he's a fighter, man.

952
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:57,003
- He'll make it.
- Bitch-ass police.

953
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:11,184
He's gonna be all right.

954
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:14,854
He's gonna be all right.

955
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:32,455
Y'all, let's pray.

956
01:13:32,623 --> 01:13:34,540
Let's pray.

957
01:13:41,507 --> 01:13:43,758
Heavenly Father

958
01:13:43,926 --> 01:13:45,927
we kneel before you

959
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:51,557
and ask you to put healing
hands around your child.

960
01:13:51,725 --> 01:13:57,438
We ask you, dear Lord,
to operate through these doctors.

961
01:13:59,483 --> 01:14:04,070
Breathe strength ίnto theίr hands, Lord,

962
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:09,033
We're askίng you rίght now to heal hίm .

963
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:12,120
Oh, heal him , dear Lord.

964
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:16,290
So we can hold hίm
and see hίs smίle agaίn.

965
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,460
ln your name, we pray. Amen.

966
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,834
He's gonna be all right.

967
01:15:11,138 --> 01:15:13,389
He didn't make it.

968
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,732
I need to see him.

969
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:25,067
OK, you can see him.

970
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:27,612
But they don't want you to go
into the room or touch him,

971
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:30,489
because they ruled it a homicide.

972
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:33,159
I need to see him.

973
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:36,829
I need to see him.

974
01:15:36,997 --> 01:15:39,332
- I can take her.
- OK.

975
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:41,584
You want me to go with you?

976
01:15:41,752 --> 01:15:43,669
No.

977
01:15:44,588 --> 01:15:46,505
No, that's my baby.

978
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:23,125
I told him to take the train.

979
01:16:24,169 --> 01:16:27,922
I told him to catch the BART.

980
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,716
I didn't know they were going to hurt my baby.

981
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:34,011
I should've just let him drive.

982
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:38,266
I should've just let him drive,
but I wanted to keep him safe.

983
01:16:42,938 --> 01:16:45,439
You gotta let me hug him.

984
01:16:45,607 --> 01:16:47,024
Please, let me hug him.

985
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:49,568
Please. Please. . .

986
01:16:49,736 --> 01:16:52,154
He didn't like to be alone.

987
01:17:11,591 --> 01:17:14,218
Come on, T.Come on, baby.

988
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:16,470
We got to go.

989
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:18,306
You got to go?

990
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:20,808
Shh. Go back to bed.

991
01:17:20,976 --> 01:17:24,186
Go back to bed, OK? OK. . .

992
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,908
Where's Daddy?
