1
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,337
Dear sister and brother-in-law,
thank you

2
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,840
From here on in, it's your show

3
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,634
Isn’t it our turn for photos?

4
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,345
Where are the kids?

5
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,858
Grandma...

6
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,777
look

7
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,699
It was on the tree

8
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,456
Anything wrong?

9
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,070
You know that strange woman?

10
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,157
Can I help you, Miss?

11
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,576
- Looking for someone
- May I ask who?

12
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,037
Mind your own business!

13
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,040
Yun-Yun!

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,209
Ting-Ting...

15
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,045
you look so pretty today!

16
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,214
Where's your grandma?

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,642
I'm so sorry!

18
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:12,149
It should have been me
marrying your son today!

19
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,445
I let you down, I'm so sorry

20
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,616
It breaks my heart,
I'm not worthy of you!

21
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,952
Don't push me around!

22
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,789
It's not that bad!

23
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,833
Where is she?

24
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,419
Where is that pregnant bitch?

25
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,547
Dad...

26
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,799
Grandma wants to go home

27
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,759
Go home?

28
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,804
She doesn't feel well

29
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,267
And tonight?

30
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,149
Where's Xiao Yan?

31
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,193
Show your face, Xiao Yan!

32
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,449
Give A-Di back to me!

33
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,702
You'll face retribution
for this!

34
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,331
YI YI

35
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,817
Sorry about the mess

36
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,735
We're the Jiangs... I'm Lili

37
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,487
I'm Ting-Ting

38
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,072
This is my grandma

39
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,074
We're the Jians

40
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,909
See you later, bye!

41
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,616
Ting-Ting!

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,620
Take out the garbage before we go

43
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,289
I'm doing it

44
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,499
It's starting to smell

45
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,627
There's some on the balcony

46
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,129
I know

47
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,724
What was I getting?

48
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,862
How did you find me?

49
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,655
Followed the removal men

50
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,741
Mother will be livid!

51
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,201
I miss you!

52
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,495
Don't I call you?

53
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,538
Can't see you on the phone

54
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,665
Come

55
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,024
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of moving house

56
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,611
It's a huge mess!

57
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,073
Call me on this mobile number

58
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,575
I'll have a phone-line in tomorrow

59
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,540
No problem

60
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,973
Ready, Ting-Ting?

61
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,194
What's on your mind?

62
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,905
I feel sorry for Yun-Yun

63
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,746
If it's not Uncle's fault,
it must be Xiao Yan's

64
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,792
Don't say that, we hardly know her

65
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,505
I think Grandma's right,
we can't accept her

66
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,382
Did Grandma say that?

67
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,219
No...
but she's been unhappy all day

68
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,471
Did she say anything else?

69
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,641
No, but she said
she feels really old

70
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,060
What does she mean by that?

71
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,028
The groom is right behind me!

72
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,488
Put your hands together!

73
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,913
Your wife's brother is some guy!

74
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,458
Not many weddings
with the bride so very pregnant!

75
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,460
That's the way he is!

76
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,795
He put off the wedding
for months...

77
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:11,008
because this is the luckiest day
of the year in the almanac

78
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,138
Take his shoe!

79
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,852
Don't mess with girls!

80
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,694
Pregnant brides aren't
unusual these days

81
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:35,115
We had "bus rides without tickets"
in our day too, you know

82
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,077
Sorry, Yang-Yang,
this is your seat

83
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,788
Girls teased him again

84
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,540
Never mind, have some food

85
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,085
So, did you and NJ?

86
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,670
Guess

87
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,838
No thanks!

88
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,925
You women always trap men
that way!

89
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,135
It still works!

90
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,429
It worked on your brother!

91
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,058
NJ would be a pushover!

92
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,226
So?

93
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,978
Here's the bus-rider!

94
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,855
What? I drove myself here

95
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,360
Drink! It's on my brother-in-law!

96
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,030
Why aren't you eating?

97
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,449
Those girls teased him again

98
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,536
Try this new toy!

99
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,746
Just let him be

100
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,920
Is it really you?

101
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,552
You're still in Taipei?

102
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,435
I live... in the US now

103
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,524
Your son?

104
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,611
So cute

105
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,749
This is my number

106
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,876
Call me

107
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,374
Why didn't you come that day?

108
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,626
I waited and waited...

109
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,462
I've never got over it, you know

110
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,594
Sherry!

111
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,805
How many years has it been?

112
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,849
Almost 30!

113
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,059
Not that long!

114
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,271
It hasn't been that long
since we graduated!

115
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,482
Didn't know you two
were still in touch!

116
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,236
We just ran into each other
by chance

117
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,364
Good to see you still get along!

118
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,035
My name card

119
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,498
My husband does business in China,
so I'll be in town quite a bit!

120
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,376
- Stay in touch, okay?
- I sure will

121
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,506
Sorry, I've run out of name cards.
I keep forgetting to...

122
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,885
Sorry, I must go...

123
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,512
- Remember, stay in touch!
- Promise!

124
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,560
It really is a lucky day!

125
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,979
I've forgotten my own first love

126
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,273
Why do I remember yours?

127
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,405
What did I come down for?

128
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,536
Some tea?

129
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,038
No, thanks

130
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,584
- Something wrong?
- Nothing

131
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,633
Dad, your cigar burst it!

132
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,928
See what happens when you smoke
those disgusting things?

133
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,262
It wasn't...

134
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,599
Then who was it?

135
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,143
Er... Whatever

136
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,329
Quiet! Shut it!

137
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,040
Now the elders are involved

138
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:40,462
Fair enough, they must both drink!

139
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,050
One each!

140
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,312
What the fuck is this?

141
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,982
It's called a "depth charge"

142
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,819
You'll both have pot bellies
after this!

143
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,656
Beer!

144
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,575
Plus fruit juice!

145
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,994
Chewed betel nuts!

146
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,788
Eggs and salt!

147
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,999
Drink up!

148
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,054
Applause!

149
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,527
Is it raining?

150
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,767
Can you manage
the stuff in the trunk?

151
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,729
If not, ask Dad to bring it in
when he's parked

152
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,193
Don't forget the big bag

153
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,323
Mrs Jian! Why are you so late?

154
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,911
Get to the hospital!
Your mother's been rushed there!

155
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,120
My mother?

156
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,414
Wait!

157
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,467
I'll go in to see her first, NJ

158
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,679
Wait here for A-Di,
he'll be here soon

159
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,931
Tell Ting-Ting
to put Yang-Yang to bed

160
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,141
I did. You go ahead!

161
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,019
What does the doctor say?

162
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,481
She's had a stroke...
they need to operate

163
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,943
I saw her lying in the driveway
by the dustbins...

164
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:12,781
Did she fall over?
Was she hit by a car?

165
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,368
Why was she downstairs?

166
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,204
You drove here drunk!?

167
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,289
The cops drink too!

168
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,834
Don't worry, NJ

169
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,753
Sister called
and told me what happened

170
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,632
Mother will be fine,
it's the luckiest day of the year!

171
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,635
- She'll wake up in no time.
- A-Di, it's not that simple...

172
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,846
Maybe you don't trust me

173
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,640
Things are different now!

174
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,644
I was unlucky,
so I borrowed from you and sister

175
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,772
Now my luck has turned!
I'll be repaying you soon!

176
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,482
- There's no rush
- Trust me!

177
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,902
You saw my partner Piggy tonight

178
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,698
He'll pay me back tomorrow,
and I'll pay you back next day!

179
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,388
Ting-Ting took out the garbage
in the afternoon

180
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,600
What was Mother doing
down by the dustbins?

181
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:26,146
We don't know if she fell
or was knocked over by a car

182
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,120
My brother says
she'll recover quickly

183
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,706
It was the luckiest day
of the year

184
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,375
He put off his wedding
for this lucky day

185
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,045
Nothing unlucky can happen

186
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,298
Otherwise Mother
would be dead by now

187
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,634
That's one way to see it

188
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,719
How else?

189
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,554
Don't complicate things!

190
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,181
How's this, Min-Min?

191
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,643
Didn't I say it goes to City Hall?

192
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,898
How does your Master see it?

193
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,611
You should ask him yourself,
I think

194
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,572
I spent two weeks
at the temple with you!

195
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,033
But I didn't understand
his teachings

196
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,246
I don't think the Master
would take me as his disciple

197
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,998
Two weeks may not be enough

198
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,254
Look how busy I am

199
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,798
How can I find the time?

200
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,635
Maybe you need a bit more humility

201
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,183
Are you saying...
there's something wrong with me?

202
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,437
Look at Yang-Yang!

203
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,609
My auntie was like this
at her wedding

204
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,944
So fat?

205
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,071
No, guess why

206
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,198
What's under your shirt?

207
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,741
A balloon!

208
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,703
One inside another!

209
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,499
She's coming!

210
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,293
Concubine! Concubine!

211
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,295
Is she the Concubine?

212
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,421
Shut up!

213
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,216
Stay there!

214
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,928
Get on with your work!

215
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,642
What's that in your hand?

216
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,603
Nothing

217
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,480
Better watch yourself!

218
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,318
Yang-Yang, she likes you!

219
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
Her old man will be jealous!

220
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,947
Who's her old man?

221
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,159
Today...

222
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,497
one of you has brought
something bad to class. Who is it?

223
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,833
Who has brought a condom?

224
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,335
Stand up!

225
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,592
If he won't admit it,
I'll name him!

226
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,640
Jian Yang-Yang, it's you!
Stand up!

227
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,101
Hand over your condom!

228
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,187
What's a condom?

229
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,981
Playing dumb?

230
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,108
Don't laugh! You're shameless!

231
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,490
You can't hide it!
I know everything!

232
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,951
Who's telling lies about me?

233
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,994
Never you mind!

234
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,874
You just heard something,
you didn't see it

235
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,171
So I'm wrong, am I?

236
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:43,301
You think
I need to see it to know?

237
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,263
I even know which pocket it's in

238
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,100
Your left pocket... come on!

239
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,606
What's this?

240
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,192
A balloon

241
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,992
Quiet!

242
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,916
I'll let it go this time...

243
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,669
but you'd better watch out!

244
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,157
Finish your milk!

245
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,327
We both will be late!

246
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,460
You'll never grow tall!

247
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,427
Good morning, Mrs Jiang

248
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,014
First Girls' High... great school!

249
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,266
You are good!

250
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,852
So is Lili!

251
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,397
I hear her playing every day,
so beautiful!

252
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,734
I hope it's not too loud.
Do you play an instrument?

253
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:08,029
Yes, but I'm not very good

254
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,741
Better to be good at books, anyway

255
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,413
What's the point?

256
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,041
Last year's profits are gone

257
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,043
Everyone does computers now

258
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,963
Remember how
the garment business crashed?

259
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,049
The more orders you fill,
the more money you lose!

260
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,178
Instead of cashing in...

261
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,850
you blew it all
on lavish expansion plans

262
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,560
So, what can I do?

263
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,522
You screwed up real bad,
what can I do?

264
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:46,109
We do have a strategy,
one step at a time

265
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:49,863
There's always ups and downs
at a time of transition

266
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
I warn you...

267
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,367
one more negative review...

268
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,244
and we'll pull out

269
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,955
So what's this strategy?

270
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,166
Moving into software?

271
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,834
Or into... content?

272
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,422
Damn right!
It's still hush-hush...

273
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,551
Heard of a Japanese named Ota?

274
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,303
Computer games?

275
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,930
- That surprised you, right?
- Promising...

276
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,558
Go on!

277
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,937
We're always cutting-edge!

278
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:28,109
Sure you are! But you're
down the tube if we pull out

279
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,697
Why "cash in" when we were ahead?

280
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,409
"No prisoners!" was our policy.
Remember?

281
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,037
He better shut up!

282
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,288
Why should he?

283
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:44,125
You were too honest
and told him everything!

284
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm not like you...

285
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,714
We don't even know this "Ota"

286
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,758
And we're going bust!

287
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,301
He doesn't come cheap

288
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,928
He's a brand name!

289
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
We buy his name...

290
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,640
to attract investors!

291
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,393
Brand name? What if
it costs too much to recoup?

292
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,063
It's our neck, I'm against it!

293
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:09,484
Taiwan has the best copycats.
Are they ripping off Ota's stuff?

294
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,153
I'll check

295
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,449
What will you guys do
if we go bust?

296
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:21,204
I know, you'll retire,
stay home and smoke your pipe

297
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,958
Da-Da, you'll move
to San Francisco?

298
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,252
And you, NJ?

299
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,755
All your money's in the company,
isn't it?

300
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,424
He didn't hear me

301
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,134
He doesn't want to answer

302
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,682
He has other things on his mind

303
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,148
I'm going, Uncle is here

304
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,194
Ting-Ting! You're leaving?

305
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,197
Yes, you two enjoy yourselves

306
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,580
I didn't know she was meeting you

307
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,376
She and I are still very close

308
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,504
Hey, everything's fine now

309
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:16,718
I even urged Ting-Ting
to be kind to your new wife

310
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,724
We didn't marry,
but we're still friends

311
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,851
All these years!

312
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,520
Yes, many years

313
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,066
You're so calm, I'm surprised

314
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,235
Let's get to work

315
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,656
Everyone was stunned by what
you did at the wedding banquet

316
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,994
Don't get me going again, okay?

317
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,996
Here, look

318
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,624
I've transferred part
of our savings to your account

319
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,754
We cleared 20 million
on Yahoo and AOL

320
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,882
Part of it is in a mutual fund

321
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,260
The documents here
need your authorization

322
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,727
And find me a boyfriend

323
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,813
I'm alone now, you know that

324
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,611
Figures give me a headache

325
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,659
Lili!

326
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,043
I heard your grandma
is in hospital

327
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,252
Yes

328
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,129
Is it serious?

329
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:39,384
She's in a coma... She fell

330
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,804
I love your grandma,
she's so elegant

331
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,972
She was a teacher

332
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,433
It's your boyfriend...

333
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,060
Right

334
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,938
Why don't you go over?

335
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,372
I'll see you later

336
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,176
You should move her
every hour or so

337
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,011
Like this

338
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,597
A different position every time

339
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,350
First one side, like this...

340
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,521
then the other, like that

341
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,483
And put a pillow under her back

342
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,402
That's the way

343
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,198
And pat her back often

344
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,287
Do it yourself
if the nurse isn't here

345
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,039
- That's for her circulation?
- Exactly

346
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,793
I think that's all...

347
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,253
Doctor...

348
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:02,049
how long before Mother
regains consciousness?

349
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,885
It's hard to say

350
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,638
Treat her normally...
open her window in the daytime

351
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,684
Take her out in the wheelchair,
turn off the lights at night

352
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:16,856
Most important, talk to her,
it stimulates her senses

353
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,400
But I'm not optimistic

354
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,571
You should prepare for the worst

355
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,763
Sorry, brother-in-law,
I haven't repaid you yet

356
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,515
Never mind

357
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,686
If I forget again, remind me

358
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,355
I'm thinking about the company

359
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,526
Bad mood?

360
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,529
More financial problems?

361
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,657
You're not going bust, are you?

362
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,202
I'm thinking about the meeting
with the Japanese tomorrow

363
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,664
Fuck! Are you in debt to Japan?

364
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:43,294
No! What are you saying?

365
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,046
Of course not!

366
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:49,717
Yang-Yang...

367
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,802
it's your turn

368
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:58,351
From now on, we'll take turns
to talk to Grandma

369
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,562
It will make her wake up sooner

370
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,817
Ting-Ting hasn't done it

371
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,613
She played the piano, didn't she?

372
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:16,911
I could show her my drawings,
but she can't see

373
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,415
But she'll hear you!
Didn't the doctor say so?

374
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,001
There's lots to tell her

375
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,754
Like what happened at school...

376
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,090
or some little secret you have

377
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,884
You can tell Grandma anything

378
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,599
What's the matter?
Why that grumpy look?

379
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,103
Don't want to talk to her?

380
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,947
What's the point?
She can't see what I tell her

381
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,950
What?

382
00:33:56,284 --> 00:34:00,788
Are you trying to get out of it?
That's not nice!

383
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:05,000
How can you let Grandma down?

384
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,296
You're making me cross!

385
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,508
Don't they teach you anything
at school?

386
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,677
Grandma loves you so much

387
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,973
You can't just ignore her,
can you?

388
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,225
You just can't!

389
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:28,441
You take a break...
I'll talk to her first

390
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,530
It's my turn

391
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,955
Ma, I'm good at talking

392
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:47,793
Luck's on my side now,
don't worry!

393
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,632
I'm rich now

394
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,260
People come to me for loans!

395
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:01,807
Not like the old days
when my borrowing made you worry

396
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,771
I've made lots of rich friends

397
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,359
And...

398
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,700
Don't you worry about Xiao Yan

399
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,745
She's a nice girl

400
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,413
Really...

401
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,169
And... what else...

402
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,675
The other stuff...
I guess you know

403
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,389
If you have questions,
you can't ask...

404
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,062
Today...

405
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,110
let's call it...

406
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,075
You must be tired...

407
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,994
I'll try and tomorrow...

408
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,709
That's for... today...

409
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,070
Grandma

410
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,162
Did I forget
to take out the garbage?

411
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,669
I can't remember

412
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:52,102
If you forgive me, wake up!

413
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,357
Please?

414
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:08,619
Because,
I can't sleep if you don't

415
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,838
Survival instincts
are all the same

416
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:24,218
Overfeeding may not improve growth

417
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,388
It may diminish
evolutionary impulses

418
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,557
So, the drive to reproduce
declines

419
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,561
Some of you
can't bring them into bloom

420
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,939
You're overdoing the care

421
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,234
Like, say... Jian Ting-Ting

422
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,779
Jian Ting-Ting!

423
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,450
She stays up all night
nurturing her plant

424
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:53,747
The others must be slacking...
See how they bloom?

425
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,721
It begins to acquire
signs of human life...

426
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,765
It begins to think,

427
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,936
then matures
into a living entity...

428
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:19,898
and becomes
our most devoted companion

429
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,028
That's the limitless future
for computer games

430
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,864
We haven't yet surpassed...

431
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,992
fighting and killing games

432
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,786
Not because we haven't fully
understood computers

433
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:37,124
But because we haven't fully
understood ourselves: human beings

434
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,328
Our future collaboration
can be based on these objectives

435
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,789
This is the way forward

436
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,501
These are uncharted waters,

437
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,004
so I understand your hesitations

438
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,549
But this cutting-edge approach
puts us well ahead

439
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,760
of any future competition

440
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,514
So there are ample grounds
for optimism

441
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,475
That concludes my presentation,
thank you

442
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,153
Wonderful!

443
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:54,326
We learned a lot today!

444
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,371
Really good...

445
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,415
No-one's dared try it before,

446
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,085
but we have to pay for it?

447
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,713
I thought we were just buying
a brand name, pure and simple

448
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,465
I liked what he said

449
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,219
It's a risk worth taking

450
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,597
Shit, you were against it before!

451
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,100
He's too expensive, not worth it

452
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,602
I found a local copycat of Ota

453
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,064
Calls itself "Ato", close enough?

454
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,067
Forget the names!
What about performance?

455
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,736
Small return on small risks,
big deal!

456
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,072
It beats big losses on big risks

457
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,116
Let's not sign with him yet!

458
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:38,620
Find an excuse
to send him back to Tokyo

459
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,415
That's not nice!
Who has to tell him?

460
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,294
NJ...

461
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:50,090
take Mr. Ota to dinner tonight.
Tell him we're keen to sign

462
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,636
But play hard to get,
let's buy some time

463
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,346
Why me?

464
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,890
You look honest!

465
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,184
So? Am I pretending?

466
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,936
What's wrong with a little acting?

467
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,982
So honesty is an act?
And friendship? Business?

468
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,943
Is anything real left?

469
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:41,266
Don't mind what I said
about acting

470
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,020
We've been a team since schooldays

471
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,857
Sure, why else do I stick around?

472
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:53,070
By the way, Sherry's husband,
Rodney Breitner...

473
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,615
He's from Chicago,
big in insurance

474
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,825
Good reputation

475
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,412
I had a long talk with her
on the phone

476
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,790
She asked me to say "Hi"

477
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,502
Give her a call sometime

478
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,923
Just as a classmate,
not an ex-lover

479
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,062
It's not locked

480
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,355
You're home early

481
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,357
I was next door

482
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,906
Hello? Dad!

483
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:42,369
Yang-Yang hid the phone,
I couldn't find it

484
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,663
It was under the seat cushion

485
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:52,629
We're cooking a health-food dinner
and you'll miss it!

486
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,842
Okay, next time

487
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,220
Yes, I'll tell Ma

488
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,063
That was my dad

489
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:14,151
He's going to miss my masterpiece

490
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,903
Well, that's his loss

491
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,621
So what's next?

492
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,582
Check that page

493
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,673
We're out of carrots

494
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,759
We have some

495
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:52,481
Next time
I'll show you my pad in Shanghai

496
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,441
My daughter's in

497
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,779
My daughter Lili

498
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,322
Call him Uncle

499
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,157
Call me Allen

500
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,246
You're cooking?

501
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,083
Nice place you have here

502
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,377
Hi, Mrs Jiang

503
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:18,298
Ting-Ting, you're cooking too?
Big job, isn't it?

504
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,050
It's fun!

505
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,886
Join us for a health-food feast!

506
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,138
We're going to the movies

507
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,682
That's nice... Hold on

508
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,311
Allen, make yourself at home

509
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,105
I'm fine

510
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,024
We're going to the movies?

511
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:45,659
It's on me.
Treat Ting-Ting to a good show

512
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,372
Your daughter is a musician!

513
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,418
She certainly is,
she's won prizes!

514
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,548
Lots of comedies,
which one do you fancy?

515
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:09,683
We can do something else...
if you'd prefer...

516
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,071
Welcome

517
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,575
Can I help you?

518
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,493
Our friend is...

519
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,495
They're my friends

520
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,500
Hi, Fatty

521
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,628
I thought you were cooking

522
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,881
What're you doing?

523
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,049
Checking these

524
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,726
I don't come here every day

525
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,815
Wait for me
at the usual place, okay?

526
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,657
"Fatty"? He's so thin!

527
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,078
Maybe he used to be fat

528
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,711
You shouldn't mind waiting...
he's often waited for you

529
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,713
It's not that...

530
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,467
He'll be here soon

531
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:30,972
Want to be alone?

532
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,059
I can go home...

533
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,605
Okay

534
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,654
Don't worry, he'll be here soon

535
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,303
Keep it down!
This isn't your own place!

536
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,140
Hey, you seem
to be disturbing her!

537
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
Cool it!

538
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,646
It's not our fault that
your boyfriend stood you up!

539
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,356
Leave her alone

540
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,026
Been in the army too long,
I'm not used to this!

541
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,780
Don't worry

542
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,575
I may look rough
but I have a heart of gold

543
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,119
Let it be, okay?

544
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,179
This must be fish...

545
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,799
Where's he from? He's good

546
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,093
Japan. I just met him

547
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,554
He plays well for a computer guy

548
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,642
Bring more friends like him

549
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,894
Great for atmosphere

550
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,813
Times are hard

551
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,360
We're in trouble

552
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,695
Come more often...

553
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,827
Sherry? It's me, NJ

554
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,666
I'm glad it's the machine.
Otherwise I'd be tongue-tied

555
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,838
Da-Da said he spoke to you

556
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:10,051
He says you're doing well,
I'm so glad

557
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:16,682
Before,
I'd heard your life was tough

558
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:22,063
I felt it might be my fault

559
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:29,445
You asked why I vanished
without a word 30 years ago

560
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,282
There were many reasons

561
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,620
Now they all sound stupid

562
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:43,376
I'm glad that you have a good life

563
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,170
I'm really happy for you

564
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,842
All my best wishes

565
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,017
I have nothing to say to Mother

566
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:51,652
I tell her the same things
every day

567
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,155
What I did in the morning

568
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:55,781
In the afternoon

569
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,450
In the evening

570
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,830
It only takes a minute

571
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,760
I can't bear it

572
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,850
I have so little

573
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,148
How can it be so little?

574
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,240
I live a blank!

575
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,785
Every day... Every day...

576
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,207
I'm like a fool!

577
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:52,171
What am I doing every day?

578
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:17,280
If I ended up like her one day...

579
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:48,728
I'll ask the nurse
to read the newspaper to her

580
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,440
She'll have something new
to listen to, okay?

581
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,401
I was busy!

582
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,238
So was I! Why should I wait all day
for you to call?

583
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,701
- Where were you last night?
- Why should I tell you?

584
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,079
You think I'm some dumb bitch?

585
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,081
Why should I wait for you?

586
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,875
Give me back the cell-phone!

587
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,543
What are you doing?

588
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,587
You asking me?

589
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,005
Get the hell out!

590
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,924
Fuck you, you nosey bitch!

591
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:23,179
You're a fucking joke!

592
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,957
Yang-Yang, the lift's here

593
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,299
Don't stare at people like that.
It's rude

594
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,385
People will be cross

595
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,639
I wanted to know why she's unhappy.
I can't see from behind

596
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,599
How do you know she's unhappy?

597
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,478
She had a big fight last night

598
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,605
I could hear from my room

599
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,148
Really?

600
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:31,038
Daddy, I can't see what you see
and you can't see what I see

601
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:34,208
How can I know what you see?

602
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,045
Good question.
I never thought of that

603
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:40,256
That's why we need a camera

604
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,883
Do you want to play with one?

605
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:47,096
Daddy, can we only know
half of the truth?

606
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,807
What? I don't get it

607
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,643
I can only see what's in front,
not what's behind

608
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:57,106
So I can only know
half of the truth, right?

609
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,193
You have a lot of questions today!

610
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,862
Let me ask you one...

611
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:07,700
Where shall we take Mummy
this weekend to cheer her up?

612
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,743
You can decide

613
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,393
Min-Min!

614
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,273
Still here?

615
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,030
Nancy...

616
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,522
Where can I go...

617
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,691
What are you doing?

618
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,526
What are you snapping?

619
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,195
I want to show Mummy
the mosquitoes

620
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,198
Mosquitoes? Can you snap them?

621
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,369
Daddy said so,
or people won't believe me

622
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,373
That's not our place!

623
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,708
I know

624
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:07,546
Your Mum and I
both think they are strange

625
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,718
Is Mummy home?
I haven't seen her lately

626
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,737
My boss is here, bye!

627
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:19,785
Your partners are in a meeting
with Ato Company

628
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,705
They want you to join them

629
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,206
Ato?

630
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,250
Isn’t it Ota? I wasn't told

631
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:30,379
No, Ato is Ota's copycat

632
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,132
Confusing, isn't it?

633
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,761
General Manager's office

634
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,305
The President's in a meeting

635
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,975
May I say who called?

636
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,436
No? Thank you

637
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,398
General Manager's office

638
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:55,946
My boss is here,
I'll call you later

639
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,285
General Manager's office

640
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,911
Hold on

641
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:06,331
NJ, long-distance from the US

642
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,826
I knew it was you

643
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,620
You take care of the company

644
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,498
I'm staying home

645
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:33,252
Call me when you need me

646
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,030
Seems I'm the only one left
to keep you company

647
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:06,118
When Min-Min was home,
I thought...

648
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,079
she'd solve
all the problems around here

649
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,081
But now...

650
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,292
there's no-one to do it

651
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,295
And I really don't know
when she'll be back

652
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,301
It's hard for me
to mumble like this

653
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,636
I hope you won't be offended
if I say...

654
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,805
it's like praying

655
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:31,310
I'm not sure
if the other party can hear me...

656
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:37,024
and I'm not sure
if I'm sincere enough

657
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,235
Frankly...

658
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:47,451
there's very little
I'm sure about these days

659
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:53,415
I wake up feeling unsure
about almost everything

660
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:58,378
And I wonder
why I wake up at all...

661
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:01,590
just to face the same
uncertainties again and again

662
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:08,764
Would you want to wake up,
if you were me?

663
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,646
Maybe Yang-Yang's right

664
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,358
You've lived so many more years

665
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,778
Other than these questions
we can't answer...

666
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,614
what is there to tell you?

667
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,285
Anyhow, I guess
you don't blame Yang-Yang...

668
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,121
for not talking to you

669
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,585
In many ways he takes after me

670
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,046
Really

671
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,947
Which brand do you want?

672
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,240
The same one

673
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,742
Which was that?

674
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,623
This one

675
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,875
Right, hold on...

676
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,088
Shida Road Art Portraits,
can I help you?

677
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,551
And the surname is...?

678
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,595
Okay, I'll check

679
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,678
What the...?

680
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,232
What the hell are all these?

681
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,778
Oh, I get it

682
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,282
This is what they call
avant-garde art!

683
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,992
Amazing!

684
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,496
Class,
time for some art appreciation!

685
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,039
What's it for?

686
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:42,334
It's art! Expensive art!

687
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,252
Why is art expensive?

688
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,089
Why take so many?

689
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,803
Look at him! Our newfound maestro!

690
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,640
A rare genius in our school!

691
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:58,809
Didn't you love to talk back?

692
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,603
Take after your father, right?

693
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:05,315
Tell him you are caught in the act

694
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:06,608
Call him

695
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,069
and ask for help!

696
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,029
Scared?

697
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,365
Stand there until he comes!

698
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,910
Don't pull that face at me!

699
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,121
Turn around against the wall!

700
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,960
I dare you do that again!

701
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,473
How was it the other night?

702
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,227
Isn’t Lili home yet?

703
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,735
Could you give this to her?

704
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:57,617
Uh... nothing

705
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,733
This...

706
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,112
is for you

707
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,074
- It's...
- I know

708
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:50,795
"Wen-Ηo Lee,

You don't like my cooking?

719
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,893
Been to McDonald's again?

720
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,145
Why so moody?

721
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:53,024
He got picked on...
Girls, right?

722
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,968
Master wants to see you

723
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,220
Please come in, Master

724
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:27,559
Ting-Ting, Nancy is here!
Will you make some tea?

725
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:28,727
Have you eaten?

726
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,520
We just did

727
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:34,733
First, Min-Min
is doing well in the temple

728
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,736
Master wanted to visit you...

729
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:42,032
so as to know
Min-Min's family better

730
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:03,511
Mr Jian, most people
neglect spiritual disciplines

731
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,181
So you missed Min-Min's signals

732
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,767
Yang-Yang, don't run around naked!

733
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:13,313
You should join us on the mountain

734
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:18,568
A purified soul
helps the gods to answer prayers

735
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:22,364
Nothing would help your wife more

736
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:27,118
Like everyone, my wife and I
need help from others

737
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:31,790
But maybe I'd anger the gods
by making too many requests

738
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:37,212
If I turn to them only for
the big things I can't handle...

739
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,048
my sincerity may impress them more

740
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,466
But...

741
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:46,096
I haven't yet had troubles
I couldn't handle myself

742
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:51,101
These thoughts seem interesting...

743
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,736
They do this work voluntarily

744
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:05,824
Your encouragement
means so much...

745
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,535
I see

746
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,995
Do you take cheques?

747
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,831
Of course

748
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,631
Thanks, NJ

749
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,052
Your wife is in good hands

750
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,054
Thanks for all the help

751
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,390
It's our pleasure

752
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,744
Lend me $300,
I have nothing on me

753
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:36,789
A cab driver's waiting,
I owe him $300

754
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,421
You'd die without me!

755
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,549
Aren't you lucky?

756
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,802
The clothes you left
are still here

757
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,931
Do they still fit?

758
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:57,602
How did you get into this mess?

759
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,522
She went crazy and threw me out

760
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,733
I went to NJ's place...

761
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,861
He threw you out too?

762
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,364
I still owe him money

763
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,492
I was ashamed to borrow...

764
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,828
from him again

765
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:21,501
Didn't I give you 9 million
to clear your debt with NJ?

766
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,795
I let Piggy invest that

767
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:27,507
He says it's tripled in value

768
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,634
Piggy?

769
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,390
I hear he's on the run in China

770
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:38,726
Bullshit!

771
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,480
I won big on mahjong
at his place last week

772
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,858
Cash?

773
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,714
I see

774
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,384
Let's visit him tomorrow to check

775
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,928
Okay?

776
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,602
Thank you so much,
it'll only take a minute

777
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:25,023
No problem, just shut the door
when you leave

778
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,150
Don't tell anyone I let you in!

779
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:28,860
Trust me

780
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,280
Fatso, learn from your wife!

781
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,366
See how easy she handles me?

782
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,702
Thanks a lot

783
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:51,466
They're no slouches,
cleaned the place out

784
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,847
How much money have I got left?

785
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,891
Barely!

786
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:01,893
Didn't we just make ten million?

787
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,146
Values can go down too

788
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:12,528
Shit, what are these?

789
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,242
You mean...

790
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,747
I'm broke again

791
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,542
Why did you trust
a guy like Piggy?

792
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,589
Come here

793
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:36,094
Remember this: trust no-one!

794
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,888
It's just junk

795
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,265
Fucking useless!

796
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,269
Are you skipping
audio/visual class?

797
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,230
Buzz off!

798
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,075
Here she comes!

799
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,952
Quick!

800
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,206
Good morning, Dean

801
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,417
Lovely new outfit!

802
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,966
You little fuckers! Don't run

803
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:18,594

Everyone envied you!
You can't do this!

830
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,455
I'm very disappointed!

831
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,791
What sense does it make?

832
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,836
I haven't seen her in ages

833
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:59,797
Of course not! You mistreated her!

834
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:03,676
Lili is so lovely! How could you?

835
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:07,388
Is she seeing other guys?

836
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,892
I didn't say that...

837
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,977
You should know better

838
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,313
Tough lady!

839
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:17,833
How can this be?

840
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,551
Open the door!

841
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,930
Why is it suddenly locked?

842
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,641
Open the door!

843
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:38,521
Not ashamed, are you?

844
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:45,194
How can this be?

845
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,614
Lili, it's not how it looks

846
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,741
How can this be?

847
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:51,993
What is it then?

848
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,577
Listen to me

849
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,122
You're my teacher!
You're my mother!

850
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,916
You should be teaching me English!

851
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,002
Teachers are human too!

852
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,421
I'll tell the principal!

853
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,256
Listen to me!

854
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:06,757
Listen to what?

855
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,426
Excuse me

856
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,013
It's not what you think, Lili!

857
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,547
Look this way!

858
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,258
Let Daddy videotape you

859
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,429
Still crying...

860
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:12,323
Look this way...

861
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:15,201
The eyes...

862
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:23,292
What? You're moved?

863
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:25,836
Suddenly it all seems...

864
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,130
so cruel

865
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,384
What's wrong?

866
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:37,640
Is his horoscope really so bad?

867
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,519
Didn't you say...

868
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:45,856
we can counter it
by giving him a lucky name?

869
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,985
It's all right!

870
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:55,658
A-Di!

871
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:58,160
Congratulations!

872
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:01,038
You're the first!

873
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:03,457
Let's see the baby

874
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:08,129
Like you, but more handsome!

875
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:11,632
So they say! I can't tell

876
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,094
To wish you luck...

877
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,556
How's his horoscope?
What's his name?

878
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:23,477
The name is crucial,
I'm still working on it

879
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,062
Right, it's for life!

880
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,565
Have some tea

881
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,902
Congratulations! Good job, A-Di!

882
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,028
Migo!

883
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:35,698
I hear you've set
the world to rights!

884
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:41,245
Made peace between
your wife and Yun-Yun!

885
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,414
Let's drink to that!

886
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:46,125
Here, some expensive red wine!

887
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:51,881
All your old classmates
are relieved!

888
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:57,261
Lovely little baby!

889
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,597
Looks more like the mother
than the father

890
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,265
You sure?

891
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,687
Go fetch the baby pictures

892
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,981
What pictures?

893
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,483
Behind the screen!

894
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:16,113
Had a good eye, didn't I?

895
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,908
I hired Xiao Yan
fresh out of school

896
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,618
See what happens?

897
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:24,413
You should thank me, Xiao Yan

898
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,998
Right, you should

899
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:29,084
Get Migo in here!

900
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:39,678
Why is that bitch here?
Did you invite her?

901
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:44,600
Of course not!
What the hell is going on?

902
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,980
Why did you bring Yun-Yun?

903
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:56,528
She said you invited her,
and we brought the wine!

904
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,197
You didn't invite her!

905
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:00,407
You think I'm nuts?

906
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:03,744
What a let-down!

907
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,580
We all thought you two made up

908
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:09,500
We were so glad to hear it

909
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:12,920
That's what she told you all?

910
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:17,007
Weren't you so friendly
to each other just now?

911
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:20,010
Forget the past,
make a fresh start

912
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,013
Let's be happy

913
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:24,890
Fuck, it's a set-up!

914
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:26,183
What?

915
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,352
It's a fucking set-up!

916
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:34,733
Look! Throw her out, right now!

917
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,696
Come now...

918
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:42,283
Harmony is a precious thing!

919
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,870
Think of our classmates' feelings!

920
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,206
It's for everyone's good

921
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,042
Bullshit!
For everyone's good?

922
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,878
What about me?
Where does that leave me?

923
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:59,425
Your behavior isn't helping

924
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,177
Yun-Yun is our old friend!

925
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:04,847
Your wife
is out of line here

926
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:06,682
What the fuck?

927
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,603
What the fuck are you playing at,
Yun-Yun?

928
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:12,896
She doesn't mean that!

929
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,690
Trying to wreck the party?

930
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,442
You're wrecking it, not her!

931
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,652
Xiao Yan, don't get me wrong

932
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:22,114
I'm sincerely happy
for both of you, believe me

933
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:25,534
So I'm the villain?
What did I do to deserve this?

934
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,579
Xiao Yan! Take some advice!

935
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:33,584
You should repent! Our friendship
doesn't deserve this!

936
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:36,545
Don't leave! Stay here!

937
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,048
Long time no see, don't go!

938
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:43,302
Classmates, calm her down
or Yun-Yun will leave!

939
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:45,262
This is not right!

940
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:48,599
Xiao Yan invited us!
We are her guests!

941
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:51,643
See? I'm the host!

942
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:54,313
You're full of shit!

943
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:55,814
This is not fair!

944
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:58,025
Who asked your opinion?

945
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,088
You lowlife!

946
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:21,965
This is all your fault!

947
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,468
Xiao Yan and the baby
are coming with me

948
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,970
You'll never see them again!

949
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:30,808
I'll cut off your dick
and feed it to the pigs!

950
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:34,812
Let's get Xiao Yan and the baby
out of here!

951
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,775
Named your baby yet?

952
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:45,280
His horoscope's bad?

953
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,953
Why was Yun-Yun there?

954
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,832
It was a set-up

955
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:59,002
You've been seeing her?

956
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,964
Not exactly...

957
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:07,428
Xiao Yan's been pregnant

958
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:11,014
Yun-Yun and I go back a long way

959
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,149
I've helped her out a little,
out of courtesy

960
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:53,849
Paging NJ Jian,
you have a visitor!

961
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:56,560
How courteous

962
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,190
You're one lucky guy

963
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,860
A nice home and a colorful life!

964
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:09,656
I'll take a shower,
help yourself to a drink

965
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:12,826
Give me a break,
I have to drive home

966
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:17,789
Sleep it off,
start afresh tomorrow

967
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,583
I wish!

968
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,084
Go to bed

969
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,086
A bad day's over

970
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:45,859
It's all over

971
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,298
Fuck!

972
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:11,301
Look at this mess!

973
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:24,648
Thanks

974
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:38,662
All these empty bottles, damn it

975
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,206
A-Di!

976
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:52,009
Can't you answer
while you're running your bath?

977
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:55,220
Still mad at me, you bastard?

978
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:04,354
What are you doing in there?
I smell gas!

979
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,905
What happened?

980
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:16,450
Open the door!

981
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:22,956
Telephone!
Where's the damn phone?

982
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,673
Open the door, A-Di!

983
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,400
What were you doing?

984
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:52,861
Why did you close the window?

985
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,997
What were you doing?

986
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,042
Why didn't you open the window?

987
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:11,129
Why was the window closed?

988
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:29,856
Why didn't you open it?

989
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:41,743
I won't fight with you again

990
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:50,293
What happened?

991
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,629
You seemed fine last night

992
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,881
Don't scare me

993
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,800
I'm fine

994
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,261
What did I do?

995
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:01,430
I just took a bath!

996
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,474
Go ask the gas company

997
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:07,811
Check my pager for me

998
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:10,313
What a time to page me!

999
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:16,403
2773-7557

1000
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:20,574
That's my office!
Why are they paging you?

1001
01:41:20,742 --> 01:41:25,203
I tried all your numbers!
Lucky we had his pager number

1002
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:27,456
What's the rush?

1003
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:30,041
We have serious interest
from this guy

1004
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:32,502
But he gives us only one hour

1005
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,046
What guy? Interested in what?

1006
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:36,173
Get in

1007
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,134
You need an 'honest-looking' guy
again, right?

1008
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,596
Why come to me?
You've sewn it up!

1009
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:44,222
Get on board

1010
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:47,058
Mind if I don't have a ticket?

1011
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,771
Boss Huang knows all about Ota

1012
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:55,192
You've signed with him, and Boss
Ηuang wants in at whatever price

1013
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,778
Today, we'll finalize the details

1014
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:02,449
NJ is Ota-san's very old friend!
Right, NJ?

1015
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,535
Boss Huang was drinking
with the President all night

1016
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:08,038
He's resting now.
Time is tight

1017
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:10,373
Wait here a moment

1018
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:20,717
Fly to Tokyo and sign
with Ota right away!

1019
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,719
Get on the next flight

1020
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:28,892
Huang used to run game arcades

1021
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,603
He knows Ota's stuff well

1022
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:37,400
As a legislator,
he now supports women's rights...

1023
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,361
and quotas!

1024
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,199
Is this gonna make money?

1025
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,660
This is a long weekend in Japan

1026
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:52,249
The noon flight is full,
you're wait-listed

1027
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,419
Shall I book a later flight?
You'd get in quite late

1028
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,505
Why not? Go ahead

1029
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:07,806
International call on Line 2.
This person has called before

1030
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,568
I was away...
running around on business

1031
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:22,028
I'll be in Tokyo tomorrow

1032
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:24,698
Are you sure?

1033
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:28,869
Hang on, I'll check

1034
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:32,414
Which hotel am I in?

1035
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,892
I won't be your go-between!

1036
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:56,313
Why come to me again?
What did I say last time?

1037
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,481
This is for you, Ting-Ting

1038
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:33,183
I have to go to Tokyo tomorrow

1039
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:36,019
The nurse
will come in every day, but...

1040
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:41,024
You'll be on your own, okay?

1041
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,274
You got here so quickly!

1042
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:08,570
So many flights everyday
from Chicago to Tokyo

1043
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:58,661
Shall we visit
your father's school?

1044
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:12,675
We'll change
from the green line to...

1045
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,761
the blue

1046
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:16,471
That's the exit

1047
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,182
But the map says this way

1048
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,893
No, that's the way out

1049
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:25,897
The blue line is this way,
that's the Chuo line

1050
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,531
This reminds me of our first date

1051
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:39,452
I was so nervous I had hiccups,
remember?

1052
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,414
I've had hiccups since I was a kid
whenever I'm nervous...

1053
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:49,379
I was too nervous to ask why!

1054
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:53,383
You were too nervous to breathe!

1055
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:56,553
I sweat when I'm nervous,
my palms,

1056
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,513
even my feet!

1057
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:16,948
Excuse me

1058
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:07,707
Rodney and I
don't have children...

1059
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,751
but he loves kids

1060
01:49:10,336 --> 01:49:12,629
He's on business a lot

1061
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:18,176
We're thinking of adopting
so I'll have company

1062
01:49:18,344 --> 01:49:20,011
- And you?
- Two

1063
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:22,847
A girl in high school
and a boy of 8

1064
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:24,933
I love my daughter

1065
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,144
She's growing into a woman.
I get jealous...

1066
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:31,439
knowing eventually
she'll be with someone else

1067
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:35,401
My son? I want to be his friend...

1068
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:38,279
The relationship I always wanted
with my father

1069
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:40,281
What time is it?

1070
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,700
Nine

1071
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:50,083
It's almost 10...
that's 8 am in Chicago

1072
01:49:50,251 --> 01:49:53,044
9 pm in Taipei

1073
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,630
Let's find a place for the night

1074
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:03,596
Look, this is like
the crossing near our school

1075
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:06,224
That's gone now

1076
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:09,769
The first time I held your hand...

1077
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:14,023
We were at a railroad crossing,
going to the movies

1078
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,777
I reached for you,
ashamed of my sweaty palm...

1079
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:23,366
Now, I'm holding your hand again

1080
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:31,374
Only it's a different place...

1081
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:33,710
A different time...

1082
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,212
A different age...

1083
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,048
But the same sweaty palm

1084
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,722
Did you like the movie?

1085
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:47,890
A bit too serious

1086
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,518
You prefer comedies?

1087
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:54,731
Not really,
but it didn't have to be so sad

1088
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:58,818
Life is a mixture
of sad and happy things

1089
01:50:58,986 --> 01:51:02,405
Movies are so lifelike,
that's why we love them

1090
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:07,744
Then who needs movies?
Just stay home and live life!

1091
01:51:07,911 --> 01:51:11,331
My uncle says...

1092
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:15,168
"we live three times as long
since man invented movies"

1093
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:17,253
How can that be?

1094
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:22,383
It means movies give us twice
what we get from daily life

1095
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:24,135
For example, murder

1096
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:27,472
We never killed anyone,
but we all know...

1097
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:30,266
what it's like to kill.

1098
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:32,143
That's what we get from the movies

1099
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:34,103
What good is it to me?

1100
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:36,773
If life's so horrible,
why live at all?

1101
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,942
If we're nice to people,
they'll be nice back

1102
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,403
Who needs to kill anybody?

1103
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:44,697
It's only one example

1104
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,657
There are other things

1105
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:48,743
Like he also said...

1106
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,328
"There's no cloud...

1107
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:51,913
"no tree...

1108
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:53,956
"that isn't beautiful

1109
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:56,459
"So we should be too"

1110
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,670
I found that very touching

1111
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:02,298
It changed me in many ways

1112
01:52:03,759 --> 01:52:06,969
You make it sound tragic!

1113
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:10,640
Shouldn't it sound cheerful?

1114
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,272
Later I married and had a child,

1115
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,525
didn't you hear?

1116
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:25,154
But I divorced within a year

1117
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:30,159
I went to study in Seattle,
married a Chinese-American

1118
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:36,707
I had to run away

1119
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,337
That day...

1120
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:44,132
I waited and waited

1121
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,760
You never showed up

1122
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:52,181
I waited because I knew...

1123
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:55,852
I'd be ruined if I didn't see you

1124
01:52:56,019 --> 01:53:00,022
I wouldn't know how to live on!
I'd fall apart!

1125
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:05,194
Waiting was my only chance

1126
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,281
I waited for one day

1127
01:53:09,116 --> 01:53:11,576
Then for another day

1128
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:17,290
I asked friends to find you.
There was no response

1129
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:20,376
You just vanished

1130
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:26,799
I left without a word

1131
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:31,053
Aside from silly excuses,
I had nothing to say

1132
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:34,223
I was so angry!

1133
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:38,227
You pushed me
to become an engineer

1134
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:42,398
Did you ever ask what I wanted?

1135
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:47,612
You and my parents were so happy
the day I graduated

1136
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:50,698
But me? I was so sad

1137
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:59,790
You can't run someone else's life,
dictate how he spends his days...

1138
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,709
That's sad, you know?

1139
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:05,129
And the one doing it
was the one I loved most!

1140
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,717
So...

1141
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:13,971
Do you know how that hurt inside?

1142
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:16,182
Do you?

1143
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:25,066
How funny...

1144
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:29,904
I'm doing exactly
what you wanted me to do

1145
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:34,534
And you have a better life
than I could ever give you

1146
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:37,662
You were so naive...

1147
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:40,331
I thought we'd end up penniless

1148
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:43,876
What? You were always after me!

1149
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:45,628
Nonsense!

1150
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:49,006
You were just standing there
looking at me!

1151
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:51,634
I couldn't stand it any longer!

1152
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:55,805
Remember what I said?

1153
01:54:56,390 --> 01:55:00,309
"If you want to talk to me,
get a move on!"

1154
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,188
Why did you...

1155
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:08,317
suddenly fall for me
in high school?

1156
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:11,737
It was much earlier

1157
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,031
In primary school

1158
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:16,951
That's when it all started

1159
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:22,373
Strange, I just wanted
to see you every day

1160
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:27,211
If I missed seeing you,
I'd feel bad all day

1161
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,466
That's why you gawped...

1162
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:38,514
We all wore uniforms
but yours looked different

1163
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:41,350
In what way?

1164
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,145
A very special way...

1165
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:21,242
Yang-Yang...

1166
01:57:23,787 --> 01:57:25,955
You've been in there a long time

1167
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,293
What are you doing?

1168
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,465
Say something!

1169
01:57:36,758 --> 01:57:38,718
Why don't you answer?

1170
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:41,303
Hurry up! Come out!

1171
01:57:45,267 --> 01:57:46,809
What are you doing?

1172
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:54,316
What are you playing with?

1173
01:57:55,235 --> 01:57:58,404
Did you fall into the toilet?

1174
01:58:01,366 --> 01:58:03,534
What are you doing in there?

1175
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,539
May I use your mother's bathroom?

1176
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,332
Of course

1177
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:23,304
That'll be from the hospital

1178
01:58:23,472 --> 01:58:25,181
I'll get it

1179
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:55,211
Tell me the truth

1180
01:59:00,217 --> 01:59:01,801
What?

1181
01:59:13,772 --> 01:59:16,232
Are you seeing Fatty?

1182
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,115
No...

1183
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:27,910
We're just friends

1184
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:34,453
Don't be like this, Ting-Ting

1185
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:40,626
Of course she spoke to me too

1186
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:47,925
You have known her a long time.
That's how she is

1187
02:01:48,093 --> 02:01:50,094
You should know by now

1188
02:02:02,232 --> 02:02:04,566
What is she to you now?

1189
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:08,529
Nothing

1190
02:02:17,455 --> 02:02:19,415
In my heart...

1191
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:25,921
there's only you!

1192
02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:37,433
Is that true?

1193
02:02:39,853 --> 02:02:41,812
You don't believe me?

1194
02:04:59,742 --> 02:05:01,118
It's...

1195
02:05:06,291 --> 02:05:07,958
not right

1196
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,795
One of my aunts got married here

1197
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,214
Which one?

1198
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:56,590
It was that summer

1199
02:05:56,758 --> 02:06:00,761
They still dance the twist
around here!

1200
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:02,262
"Good morning"

1201
02:06:05,475 --> 02:06:09,228
Good morning? It's almost bedtime!

1202
02:06:09,395 --> 02:06:12,022
It's the only Japanese word
I know!

1203
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:50,143
The clerk gave you a strange look
when he handed you two keys

1204
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:53,438
Who sleeps
in separate rooms these days?

1205
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:56,608
To sleep with someone
means nothing now

1206
02:06:57,277 --> 02:06:58,318
You're off again

1207
02:06:58,486 --> 02:06:59,861
But it's true!

1208
02:07:00,029 --> 02:07:02,948
You dragged me to a hotel first,
remember?

1209
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:05,534
I was scared, I ran off!

1210
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:11,748
I used to think you'd vanish
if I just looked away

1211
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:15,127
If you gave yourself to me...

1212
02:07:15,503 --> 02:07:19,381
you could always hold me
to account for it later, right?

1213
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:22,968
Not at all

1214
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:26,471
But when you left the room...

1215
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:31,018
I knew you didn't love me
any more

1216
02:07:36,107 --> 02:07:38,233
You still feel that way now?

1217
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:30,452
You know how I felt...

1218
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:33,372
when you turned away just now?

1219
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:38,668
It felt as if
I'd never see you again!

1220
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:45,884
I don't want to go on like this

1221
02:08:50,223 --> 02:08:54,351
I have everything.
What am I afraid of?

1222
02:08:55,770 --> 02:09:00,690
If I divorced Rodney, I'd be
well off for the rest of my life

1223
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:05,028
We could start over,
how about it?

1224
02:09:08,366 --> 02:09:12,536
I was too insecure,
it was my fault

1225
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:17,165
Now I have nothing to fear

1226
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,128
Let's start a new life, shall we?

1227
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:23,672
You're tired, Sherry

1228
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,549
Don't change the subject!

1229
02:09:25,842 --> 02:09:27,634
You're scared, right?

1230
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,095
You never loved me!

1231
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:31,847
Admit it!

1232
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:33,598
Sherry!

1233
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:46,695
Why do I behave like this
whenever I'm with you?

1234
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:50,282
Why do I always do that?

1235
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:52,159
I'm sorry

1236
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:55,537
Why do I always
make the same mistakes?

1237
02:09:55,705 --> 02:09:59,332
When I know I'll regret them
for the rest of my life?

1238
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,677
Don't feel sorry

1239
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:18,602
Who understands you
better than I do?

1240
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:25,901
I think of you...

1241
02:10:27,111 --> 02:10:30,155
every day of my life, you know?

1242
02:10:36,496 --> 02:10:37,913
Think?

1243
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:40,415
Think...

1244
02:10:40,917 --> 02:10:43,084
We all need time to think

1245
02:10:44,378 --> 02:10:46,296
Carefully think

1246
02:10:54,055 --> 02:10:55,347
Come on

1247
02:10:55,515 --> 02:10:57,974
This is my business trip!

1248
02:10:58,643 --> 02:11:01,478
You've handed me a huge workload!

1249
02:11:01,646 --> 02:11:04,272
It'll take several trips
to deal with!

1250
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:09,653
Give me a break,
this is a big job

1251
02:13:00,056 --> 02:13:01,723
I'm so tired

1252
02:13:03,309 --> 02:13:06,978
I have to crash

1253
02:13:07,146 --> 02:13:10,315
I'll pick you up for breakfast

1254
02:13:16,447 --> 02:13:20,283
Have a good meeting tonight

1255
02:13:30,753 --> 02:13:32,587
Sherry...

1256
02:13:36,884 --> 02:13:39,469
I never loved anyone else

1257
02:15:06,056 --> 02:15:08,892
Can you bring me a pack of cards?

1258
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:14,689
Yes, but Morita-san
prohibits gambling here, sir

1259
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:18,526
I won't gamble.
Morita-san knows

1260
02:15:19,236 --> 02:15:20,904
Then why do you need them?

1261
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:22,864
Two warm pots of sake

1262
02:15:23,032 --> 02:15:24,240
Yes, sir

1263
02:19:14,596 --> 02:19:17,223
You're not gambling, are you?

1264
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:23,896
Who won?

1265
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:51,632
I tried to reach you
all day yesterday

1266
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,593
Relax, I talked to Mr. Ota...

1267
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:56,804
Listen, we've signed with Ato

1268
02:19:56,972 --> 02:20:00,224
That's what I wanted
to tell you yesterday

1269
02:20:00,392 --> 02:20:03,478
Ato? Why? I thought Boss Huang...

1270
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:08,608
He's into quota-representation
for women, I told you...

1271
02:20:08,776 --> 02:20:10,651
And Ato is a woman?

1272
02:20:11,028 --> 02:20:13,446
A 34E-cup!

1273
02:20:14,406 --> 02:20:17,867
Make an excuse
and come back home

1274
02:20:24,124 --> 02:20:26,667
What do you say, NJ?

1275
02:20:27,419 --> 02:20:29,462
Nothing! I get it!

1276
02:20:55,531 --> 02:20:57,615
NJ, what's wrong?

1277
02:20:57,991 --> 02:21:00,660
Don't get emotional,
this solves our problems

1278
02:21:00,828 --> 02:21:05,289
We should celebrate!
We didn't promise Ota anything

1279
02:21:06,041 --> 02:21:07,458
You...

1280
02:21:07,626 --> 02:21:09,460
You know that hurts!

1281
02:21:09,628 --> 02:21:11,671
What hurts?

1282
02:21:12,381 --> 02:21:15,383
Mr. Ota is a good man!
Where's our dignity?

1283
02:21:15,551 --> 02:21:18,886
What's that got to do
with business?

1284
02:23:12,751 --> 02:23:14,710
I'll ride pillion!

1285
02:23:32,145 --> 02:23:34,272
I just got back

1286
02:23:35,649 --> 02:23:38,317
Where's my cup? Can't find it.

1287
02:28:19,849 --> 02:28:23,519
Fatty, don't feel this way
because of me

1288
02:28:23,687 --> 02:28:28,357
It's okay. We can still
be friends, I'm still...

1289
02:28:28,525 --> 02:28:30,317
Still what?

1290
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:33,612
Still cheerful, right?

1291
02:28:34,573 --> 02:28:39,159
It's all crap!
Life's not like your dreams!

1292
02:28:39,995 --> 02:28:45,291
If it was, you wouldn't need those
love stories to kid yourself!

1293
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:47,710
Get lost!

1294
02:28:50,589 --> 02:28:53,882
Never bug me again!

1295
02:28:54,551 --> 02:28:56,969
Stay away from me!

1296
02:29:01,641 --> 02:29:04,852
Believe it, these things happen!

1297
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:10,399
When the stars are in alignment,
the gods smile on us!

1298
02:29:10,567 --> 02:29:13,819
How old is hi-tech? 20 years?

1299
02:29:13,987 --> 02:29:17,865
Horoscopes are
thousands of years old!

1300
02:29:19,117 --> 02:29:20,618
Ting-Ting must be back

1301
02:29:20,785 --> 02:29:24,580
Here's the bank draft

1302
02:29:24,748 --> 02:29:27,583
That clears my debt

1303
02:29:27,751 --> 02:29:32,212
That bastard Piggy
is on the run in China!

1304
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:34,006
So I rushed to his place

1305
02:29:34,174 --> 02:29:36,258
It was crawling with cops!

1306
02:29:36,426 --> 02:29:39,845
The place was empty
and sealed off!

1307
02:29:40,013 --> 02:29:43,724
So I found this one cop

1308
02:29:43,892 --> 02:29:46,393
Talked him into letting me in

1309
02:29:46,561 --> 02:29:49,813
Shit, the creditors
had cleared the place out!

1310
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:52,566
Only junk left lying around

1311
02:29:52,734 --> 02:29:57,529
Still, I found
this funny piece of rock

1312
02:29:57,697 --> 02:30:00,783
Nobody had seen what it was!

1313
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:04,286
How did you get so wet?
Is it raining so hard?

1314
02:30:04,454 --> 02:30:06,372
Get out of those wet clothes

1315
02:30:06,539 --> 02:30:09,500
I had it valued,
and the guy's eyes lit up

1316
02:30:09,668 --> 02:30:12,169
It was antique jade!

1317
02:30:12,337 --> 02:30:17,591
An 8000-year-old
national treasure!

1318
02:30:17,759 --> 02:30:20,094
I kept my cool

1319
02:30:20,261 --> 02:30:24,139
I asked for what Piggy owed me

1320
02:30:24,307 --> 02:30:27,518
The guy wrote out a cheque
on the spot!

1321
02:30:27,686 --> 02:30:30,938
It must have been worth a lot more

1322
02:30:31,106 --> 02:30:34,566
We shouldn't be too greedy!

1323
02:30:36,403 --> 02:30:37,861
Get out of bed!

1324
02:30:38,029 --> 02:30:41,782
Just lying there
will make you sick!

1325
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:45,119
I'll pick you up at 7 tomorrow

1326
02:30:45,286 --> 02:30:49,957
Stick with me, your horoscope
will improve no end!

1327
02:30:50,458 --> 02:30:52,751
What's this? For me?

1328
02:30:55,672 --> 02:30:57,464
This is me!

1329
02:30:57,841 --> 02:30:59,842
The back of my head!

1330
02:31:01,177 --> 02:31:02,970
What's this for?

1331
02:31:03,138 --> 02:31:06,140
You can't see it yourself,
so I help you

1332
02:31:07,267 --> 02:31:09,143
So that's why!

1333
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:11,437
That's why what?

1334
02:32:07,702 --> 02:32:10,871
I've done nothing bad

1335
02:32:17,045 --> 02:32:19,797
Why is it so unfair?

1336
02:32:32,101 --> 02:32:36,188
Unless... you haven't forgiven me

1337
02:32:46,074 --> 02:32:50,410
Why don't you wake up?

1338
02:32:56,251 --> 02:32:58,710
Please wake up, will you?

1339
02:33:23,611 --> 02:33:26,947
Nobody's home.
His daughter must be at school

1340
02:33:27,115 --> 02:33:29,700
- Which school?
- First Girls' High

1341
02:33:29,868 --> 02:33:32,953
I'll send a policewoman there

1342
02:33:33,788 --> 02:33:36,874
Mr Jian is usually home these days

1343
02:34:01,816 --> 02:34:04,568
"This front passed us
yesterday afternoon

1344

"It was reportedly a grisly scene"

1368
02:37:18,387 --> 02:37:21,515
I thought it was the nurse

1369
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:25,602
It's 2.30, she's still not here!

1370
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:45,038
I was at the police station

1371
02:37:47,792 --> 02:37:50,836
I can't face going back to school

1372
02:38:28,291 --> 02:38:31,209
I haven't slept for so long

1373
02:38:33,546 --> 02:38:35,589
I'm so tired, Grandma

1374
02:38:41,470 --> 02:38:43,180
Now...

1375
02:38:43,764 --> 02:38:45,640
you've forgiven me...

1376
02:38:47,476 --> 02:38:49,603
I can sleep

1377
02:39:05,661 --> 02:39:06,995
Grandma...

1378
02:39:09,916 --> 02:39:14,127
Why is the world so different
from what we thought it was?

1379
02:39:19,008 --> 02:39:21,176
Now that you're awake...

1380
02:39:22,595 --> 02:39:24,554
and see it again...

1381
02:39:29,227 --> 02:39:31,645
has it changed at all?

1382
02:39:38,819 --> 02:39:40,612
Now...

1383
02:39:43,991 --> 02:39:46,034
I close my eyes...

1384
02:39:50,665 --> 02:39:52,832
the world I see...

1385
02:39:56,921 --> 02:39:58,755
is so beautiful

1386
02:40:16,774 --> 02:40:20,318
Migo, this isn't a joke

1387
02:40:23,572 --> 02:40:26,491
Why would I kid you?

1388
02:40:33,416 --> 02:40:35,041
Yes, Migo

1389
02:40:36,127 --> 02:40:38,044
I'm not kidding

1390
02:40:47,054 --> 02:40:48,471
Migo...

1391
02:40:49,348 --> 02:40:51,224
calm down!

1392
02:40:54,729 --> 02:40:57,314
I feel it's my fault

1393
02:40:57,857 --> 02:41:05,655
If I'd come earlier,
this might not have happened

1394
02:41:07,325 --> 02:41:09,117
It's all my fault

1395
02:41:15,082 --> 02:41:17,417
Don't be so upset

1396
02:41:32,266 --> 02:41:37,395
It's my mother's funeral!
Money is not a problem!

1397
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:46,613
Unfortunately
I was out all day today

1398
02:41:47,948 --> 02:41:50,825
It must have been a peaceful end

1399
02:41:52,244 --> 02:41:56,164
Even if someone were home,
they wouldn't have noticed

1400
02:41:59,293 --> 02:42:02,796
Listen, stay in your room, okay?
Good boy

1401
02:42:12,431 --> 02:42:18,478
It was about 3 hours ago,
around 2.30 pm

1402
02:43:08,362 --> 02:43:10,363
Nothing's changed here

1403
02:43:10,823 --> 02:43:14,742
The kids are both fine

1404
02:43:17,663 --> 02:43:21,207
How was it up the mountain?

1405
02:43:24,587 --> 02:43:26,045
It was fine

1406
02:43:32,845 --> 02:43:40,393
Actually, it was much the same...

1407
02:43:41,729 --> 02:43:43,438
Just like...

1408
02:43:43,814 --> 02:43:46,649
talking to Mother

1409
02:43:48,736 --> 02:43:52,238
But with the roles reversed

1410
02:43:53,199 --> 02:43:57,452
I was like Mother,
they were like me

1411
02:43:58,496 --> 02:44:04,667
They took turns to talk to me,
the same things every time

1412
02:44:06,462 --> 02:44:08,880
Several times a day

1413
02:44:20,851 --> 02:44:25,313
I've come to realise...

1414
02:44:27,149 --> 02:44:29,817
things aren't really
so complicated

1415
02:44:34,532 --> 02:44:37,283
Why did they ever seem so?

1416
02:44:37,451 --> 02:44:39,035
Right

1417
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,129
How can I say this?

1418
02:44:50,631 --> 02:44:52,423
While you were away,

1419
02:44:52,591 --> 02:44:55,969
I had a chance to relive
part of my youth

1420
02:44:57,763 --> 02:44:59,639
My first thought...

1421
02:44:59,807 --> 02:45:02,141
was that I could...

1422
02:45:02,726 --> 02:45:05,061
make things turn out differently

1423
02:45:05,312 --> 02:45:06,813
But...

1424
02:45:08,649 --> 02:45:12,193
they turned out the same,
or not much different

1425
02:45:16,282 --> 02:45:18,491
I suddenly realized that...

1426
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:22,829
even if I was given
a second chance...

1427
02:45:24,832 --> 02:45:26,916
I wouldn't need it

1428
02:45:28,335 --> 02:45:30,128
I really wouldn't

1429
02:46:35,694 --> 02:46:39,072
Why did you have to leave us?

1430
02:46:41,992 --> 02:46:47,789
How could you leave us?

1431
02:46:48,707 --> 02:46:53,461
A-Di and I
can't go on without you!

1432
02:46:56,256 --> 02:47:00,259
Come back to us!

1433
02:47:04,264 --> 02:47:07,141
You were right again

1434
02:47:09,728 --> 02:47:11,771
It was a waste of time

1435
02:47:11,939 --> 02:47:14,774
Ato's copies were terrible

1436
02:47:14,942 --> 02:47:17,610
Buyers are too smart now

1437
02:47:17,778 --> 02:47:21,489
No one buys cheap imitations

1438
02:47:24,118 --> 02:47:28,454
Boss Huang is no slouch

1439
02:47:28,831 --> 02:47:32,834
Ato is now his mistress,
surprise, surprise!

1440
02:47:33,001 --> 02:47:37,130
She just sits
by the pool half-naked...

1441
02:47:37,297 --> 02:47:39,841
and the cash comes rolling in

1442
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:42,844
One smart lady!

1443
02:47:47,182 --> 02:47:49,267
Come back, NJ

1444
02:47:50,144 --> 02:47:53,146
Rejoin the team.
We go back so far

1445
02:47:53,814 --> 02:47:57,150
Staying home all day
is no solution!

1446
02:48:00,612 --> 02:48:04,282
I've worked my butt off
all these years!

1447
02:48:04,450 --> 02:48:07,160
I didn't do it for fun!

1448
02:48:07,327 --> 02:48:11,330
You know, NJ, I'm never happy

1449
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:17,462
When you don't love what you do...

1450
02:48:17,629 --> 02:48:20,214
how could you be?

1451
02:48:29,433 --> 02:48:31,392
Can I speak to Grandma?

1452
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:33,686
Of course, go ahead

1453
02:48:55,918 --> 02:48:58,711
I'm sorry, Grandma

1454
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:02,715
It wasn't that
I didn't want to talk to you

1455
02:49:02,883 --> 02:49:08,221
I think all the stuff
I could tell you...

1456
02:49:08,388 --> 02:49:11,974
you must already know

1457
02:49:12,142 --> 02:49:17,522
Otherwise, you wouldn't always
tell me to "Listen!"

1458
02:49:17,689 --> 02:49:20,691
They all say you've gone away

1459
02:49:21,985 --> 02:49:26,531
But you didn't tell me
where you went

1460
02:49:26,907 --> 02:49:33,287
I guess it's someplace
you think I should know

1461
02:49:33,831 --> 02:49:37,959
But, Grandma, I know so little

1462
02:49:38,418 --> 02:49:41,671
Do you know what I want to do...

1463
02:49:41,839 --> 02:49:43,422
when I grow up?

1464
02:49:43,590 --> 02:49:48,344
I want to tell people
things they don't know

1465
02:49:48,512 --> 02:49:52,390
Show them stuff they haven't seen

1466
02:49:52,558 --> 02:49:57,186
It'll be so much fun

1467
02:49:57,354 --> 02:50:00,231
Perhaps one day...

1468
02:50:00,399 --> 02:50:04,777
I'll find out where you've gone

1469
02:50:04,945 --> 02:50:08,990
If I do, can I tell everyone...

1470
02:50:09,157 --> 02:50:12,660
and bring them to visit you?

1471
02:50:15,956 --> 02:50:17,290
Grandma...

1472
02:50:17,457 --> 02:50:19,625
I miss you

1473
02:50:19,793 --> 02:50:23,296
Especially when I see...

1474
02:50:23,797 --> 02:50:27,675
my newborn cousin
who still doesn't have a name

1475
02:50:28,677 --> 02:50:33,764
He reminds me that you always said
you felt old

1476
02:50:34,808 --> 02:50:38,019
I want to tell him
that I feel

1477
02:50:38,186 --> 02:50:40,271
I am old too

1478
02:53:19,347 --> 02:53:22,850
