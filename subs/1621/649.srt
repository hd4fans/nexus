1
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,662
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:37,867
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,369
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,574
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:47,780
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,086
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

7
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,992
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:58,394
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:01,300
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl,
know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,905
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:10,411
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

12
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:15,818
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego or anything like that."

13
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:20,426
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:24,530
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,934
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,339
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,844
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

18
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:37,348
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,749
Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,852
I could get to that point.

21
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,755
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,261
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,766
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:54,070
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,775
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,278
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,782
I don't think so.

28
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,509
We interrupt for a bulletin.

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,813
A high-speed pursuit between
police and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,317
traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,527
Yeah, I've got time.

32
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:03,265
Mr. Incredible.

33
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,776
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

34
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,783
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

35
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:18,386
No, he's quite tame.

36
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,507
Let go now.

37
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,532
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

38
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,733
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

39
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,236
All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

40
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,841
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

41
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:01,244
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

42
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,049
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...?

43
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,751
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,354
What? No.

45
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:10,659
You're that kid from the fan club.

46
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,663
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

47
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,566
My name is IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,769
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

49
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,471
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

50
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,175
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

51
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,179
crime fighting style,
favorite catch phrases, everything!

52
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,983
I'm your number one fan!

53
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,086
Hey! Hey, wait!

54
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,403
You know...

55
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:47,508
...you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

56
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:50,312
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

57
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,716
Hey, look...

58
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,423
Elastigirl.

59
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,526
Mr. Incredible.

60
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:04,031
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

61
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,235
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

62
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:09,039
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

63
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,042
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

64
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:14,246
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

65
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,348
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

66
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,652
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

67
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,256
Look, the lady got me first.

68
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:24,558
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

69
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,163
Well, I think you need to be more...

70
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,266
...flexible.

71
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,669
Are you doing anything later?

72
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,173
I have a previous engagement.

73
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,594
Now, you just stay here.

74
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,496
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

75
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,201
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

76
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,702
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

77
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:00,308
He's gonna jump!

78
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,630
I think you broke something.

79
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,534
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

80
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,437
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,580
Bomb Voyage.

82
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,987
And IncrediBoy!

83
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:59,589
IncrediBoy?

84
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:04,598
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

85
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,200
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

86
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,703
Can we talk?

87
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,906
You always say be true to yourself,

88
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,810
but you never say
which part to be true to.

89
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,617
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward... IncrediBoy!

90
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,720
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

91
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,223
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

92
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:26,328
Not every superhero has powers,
you know.

93
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,230
You can be super without them.

94
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,834
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

95
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,137
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,345
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

97
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,948
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

98
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:43,850
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

99
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:48,156
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

100
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:51,061
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...?

101
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:54,365
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

102
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:42,330
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

103
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,334
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

104
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,436
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

105
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:47,537
They picked him up.

106
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:50,341
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

107
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,043
who I caught robbing the vault.

108
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,246
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

109
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,249
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

110
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,853
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

111
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,158
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

112
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,462
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

113
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:08,768
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

114
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:12,973
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

115
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,285
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

116
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:24,689
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

117
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,095
Showtime.

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,606
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

119
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:39,709
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

120
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,113
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

121
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,617
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

122
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,221
You need to be more... flexible.

123
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,726
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

124
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:52,927
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

125
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,130
You know that. Don't you?

126
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,635
- ...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

127
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:00,640
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

128
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:06,948
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

129
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:11,254
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

130
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,360
In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

131
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,763
for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.

132
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,868
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

133
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:26,073
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

134
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:30,180
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

135
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,683
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

136
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,588
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions",

137
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,092
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

138
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,395
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

139
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:43,198
My client has no comment.

140
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:47,601
Another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident.

141
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:51,106
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

142
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:55,513
And opened the flood gates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

143
00:10:55,613 --> 00:11:00,619
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

144
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,624
Time for them to join us, or go away.

145
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:06,628
Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

146
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:09,231
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

147
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:13,136
the government quietly initiated
the superhero relocation program.

148
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:16,842
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

149
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,349
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

150
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,050
Where are they now?

151
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,457
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

152
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:32,865
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

153
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,771
Denied? You're denying my claim?

154
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,476
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

155
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,978
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

156
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,182
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

157
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:48,185
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

158
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,087
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

159
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,793
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

160
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,096
We're now officially moved in.

161
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,998
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

162
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,402
The last three years
don't count because...

163
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:03,507
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

164
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,612
- Why do we have so much junk?
- Listen, I've got a client.

165
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,716
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

166
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,221
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

167
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,324
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

168
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:19,430
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

169
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,831
I don't know what I'll do.

170
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:32,946
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

171
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:36,652
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

172
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:42,058
Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

173
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:45,763
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

174
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:48,168
with our legal department
on the second floor.

175
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,871
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

176
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,476
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

177
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:58,180
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- Sorry. I know you're upset!

178
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:01,186
Pretend to be upset.

179
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,691
Parr!

180
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:08,194
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

181
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:10,497
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

182
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:13,502
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

183
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:17,408
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping lnsuricare in the black.

184
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:20,112
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

185
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:24,219
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

186
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:29,325
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

187
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,935
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

188
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:40,341
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

189
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:44,546
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

190
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:47,049
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

191
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,155
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

192
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,958
Well... not really. No.

193
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,161
Actually, not.

194
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:56,261
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

195
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,964
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

196
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:08,078
See? You see?

197
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,780
You don't see it?

198
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,085
He moves! Right there!

199
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,691
Wait, wait! Right there!

200
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,495
Right as I'm sitting down!

201
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,297
I don't know how he does it,

202
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:23,700
but there's no tack before he moves

203
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,906
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

204
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,611
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

205
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,714
This little rat is guilty!

206
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:40,320
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

207
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,326
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

208
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,031
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

209
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:55,544
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

210
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,147
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

211
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,252
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

212
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,456
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

213
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:10,162
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

214
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,565
Dashiell Robert Parr,

215
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:15,770
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

216
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,973
The last thing you need is temptation.

217
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:21,479
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

218
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,781
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

219
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,184
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

220
00:15:26,184 --> 00:15:28,989
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

221
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,692
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:35,698
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

223
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,302
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

224
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,420
Rydinger, where you headed?

225
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,024
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

226
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:58,229
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

227
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,635
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

228
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:06,639
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

229
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:10,345
He looked at me.

230
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,650
Come on, Violet!

231
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:40,586
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

232
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,990
Oh, great.

233
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,042
Mom.

234
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:26,749
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

235
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,253
You make weird faces, honey.

236
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:32,959
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

237
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,861
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

238
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:38,865
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat.

239
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:44,474
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

240
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:48,280
- Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

241
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,983
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

242
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:54,089
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

243
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,091
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

244
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:59,096
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

245
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,798
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

246
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,103
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

247
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,606
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

248
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:09,310
We are not encouraging this.

249
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,513
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

250
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,214
Honey!

251
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:18,522
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

252
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,224
What happened to the car?

253
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,330
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

254
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,634
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

255
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:30,538
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

256
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:34,244
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

257
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:37,349
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

258
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,153
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

259
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,157
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

260
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,757
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

261
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,262
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

262
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,966
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

263
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,569
That's it!

264
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,771
Stop it!

265
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:00,377
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

266
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,281
Sit down!

267
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,987
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

268
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:08,590
You sit down! You sit down!

269
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,091
Violet!

270
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,903
"Simon J. Paladino,

271
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:23,109
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

272
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:27,915
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

273
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,418
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

274
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:33,021
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

275
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,327
Okay. I'm intervening!

276
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,132
Violet, let go of your brother.

277
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:40,735
Hello?

278
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,337
Get the door.

279
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:47,544
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

280
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,249
- lce of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

281
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,753
- Lucius!
- Whoa!

282
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,061
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

283
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,664
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

284
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,268
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

285
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,673
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

286
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,375
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

287
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,485
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

288
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,788
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

289
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,790
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

290
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,794
Other kids don't have superpowers.

291
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:28,399
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

292
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,103
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

293
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,108
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

294
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:39,114
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

295
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:42,320
Lucky.

296
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,924
I meant about being normal.

297
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,329
So now I'm in deep trouble.

298
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,533
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

299
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,836
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

300
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:58,940
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

301
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,846
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

302
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:07,253
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

303
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,754
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

304
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:11,960
I mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

305
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,664
- Municiberg, we have a 23-56...
- 23-56, what is that?

306
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:18,068
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

307
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,071
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

308
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,674
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

309
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:27,179
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

310
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,881
Just to shake things up.

311
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:33,590
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

312
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,992
They're just talking.

313
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,196
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

314
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:41,599
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

315
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:45,305
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

316
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,809
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

317
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,113
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

318
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:55,819
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

319
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,121
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

320
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,927
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

321
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:04,431
- We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

322
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,136
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

323
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,343
Fire! Yeah!

324
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:22,656
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

325
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:27,463
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

326
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:30,867
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

327
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,071
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

328
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:35,474
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

329
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:37,978
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

330
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:41,783
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

331
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:44,787
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

332
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,991
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

333
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:54,401
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

334
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,525
Uh-oh.

335
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,228
Oh, good.

336
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:18,933
That ain't right.

337
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:24,740
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

338
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,343
Freeze!

339
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,253
Freeze!

340
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:35,155
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

341
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm just getting a drink.

342
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:47,170
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

343
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,577
Police officers!

344
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,498
That was way too close.

345
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,201
We are not doing that again.

346
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:14,009
Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

347
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:17,615
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

348
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,955
- I thought you'd be back by 11.
- I said I'd be back later.

349
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:49,658
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

350
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,765
- ...you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

351
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,476
Is this rubble?

352
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:06,081
It was just a little
workout. Just to stay loose.

353
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:09,687
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

354
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,888
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

355
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:14,590
You knocked down a building?

356
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,594
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

357
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,198
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

358
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:23,404
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

359
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:24,906
It is a bad thing, Bob!

360
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:29,111
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

361
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,015
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

362
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,519
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

363
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,224
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

364
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:41,429
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

365
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:45,132
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

366
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,036
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

367
00:25:47,137 --> 00:25:49,840
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

368
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,844
but if someone is exceptional...

369
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:54,246
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

370
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:57,149
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

371
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:59,954
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

372
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,958
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

373
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,062
This is not about you!

374
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:10,169
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

375
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,572
Vi? You, too, young lady.

376
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,975
Come on. Come on out.

377
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,781
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

378
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,583
Pretty loud discussion.

379
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:24,289
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

380
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:30,198
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

381
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,801
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

382
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,203
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

383
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:37,405
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

384
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,911
In fact, we should all be in bed.

385
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,233
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

386
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,635
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

387
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:01,339
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

388
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,042
Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.

389
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:06,247
- Now?
- Now.

390
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,971
Sit down, Bob.

391
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:35,686
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

392
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,189
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

393
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:41,192
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

394
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:42,895
Why are you unhappy?

395
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,798
Your customers make me unhappy.

396
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,601
What, you've gotten complaints?

397
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:48,205
Complaints I can handle.

398
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:51,908
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

399
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:55,913
of lnsuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

400
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:59,218
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

401
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,722
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

402
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:04,524
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

403
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:08,929
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

404
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,235
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

405
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:14,138
Starting with our stockholders.

406
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,641
Who's helping them out, huh?

407
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:22,950
You know, Bob, a company...

408
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,654
Is like an enormous clock.

409
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:28,757
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

410
00:28:28,858 --> 00:28:33,465
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

411
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:38,973
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

412
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:44,781
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

413
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:49,188
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

414
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,890
Bob?

415
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:54,095
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

416
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:57,298
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

417
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:00,302
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

418
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:03,106
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

419
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:06,712
Stop right now or you're fired!

420
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,316
Close the door.

421
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:15,424
Get over here, now.

422
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,734
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

423
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:27,638
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

424
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:30,342
You were this close to losing your...

425
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,855
Uh-oh.

426
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,964
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

427
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,375
- How is he?
- He'll live.

428
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,079
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

429
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:58,881
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

430
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,983
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

431
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,687
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

432
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:05,891
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

433
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:08,395
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

434
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:10,998
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

435
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:14,202
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

436
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,906
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

437
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:21,012
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

438
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:24,416
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

439
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,028
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

440
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:35,232
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

441
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,534
I'll make it work. Thanks.

442
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,640
Take care of yourself.

443
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:53,958
What are you waiting for?

444
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:58,064
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

445
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,068
Me, too, kid.

446
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,502
Huh?

447
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:39,520
"Hold still"?

448
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,023
Match: Mr. Incredible.

449
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:51,437
Room is secure. Commence message.

450
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:55,941
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

451
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:58,946
Rest assured,
your secret is safe with us.

452
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:02,451
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

453
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:06,458
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

454
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,663
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

455
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,567
I represent a top secret division
of the government,

456
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,071
designing and testing
experimental technology,

457
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:19,074
and we have need
of your unique abilities.

458
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:21,478
Something happened
at our testing facility.

459
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:22,979
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

460
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,382
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

461
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,687
...it is contained
within an isolated area,

462
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:31,992
it threatens to cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

463
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,797
jeopardizing hundreds
of millions of dollars...

464
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,499
Is someone in there?

465
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,804
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

466
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:43,209
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

467
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:47,214
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

468
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:51,219
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

469
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:55,124
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

470
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,130
You can still do great things. Or...

471
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,433
...you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

472
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,438
You have 24 hours to respond.

473
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,040
Think about it.

474
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,093
This message
will self-destruct.

475
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,095
Uh-oh.

476
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,624
You are one distracted guy.

477
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,827
Am I? I don't mean to be.

478
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:15,634
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

479
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:20,340
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

480
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,045
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

481
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,347
- Something's happened.
- What?

482
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,148
- The, uh...
- What?

483
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,852
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

484
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:32,357
- A conference?
- Out of town.

485
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:33,958
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

486
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:38,265
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

487
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:39,267
Yes.

488
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:42,772
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

489
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,273
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

490
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,478
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

491
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:50,783
Hello?

492
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,886
This is Mr. Incredible.

493
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:54,888
I'm in.

494
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:05,004
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

495
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,608
lts artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

496
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,612
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

497
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:15,217
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

498
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:18,923
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

499
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:22,625
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

500
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:23,627
How am I going in?

501
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,633
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

502
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:31,140
lts cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

503
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,543
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

504
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:38,350
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

505
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,853
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

506
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,357
You are Mr. Incredible.

507
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,184
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

508
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:08,889
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

509
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:11,292
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

510
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,898
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

511
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:46,541
Showtime.

512
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,005
Huh?

513
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,035
Uh-oh.

514
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,619
Oh, my back!

515
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:07,318
Surprising. We must bring him back.

516
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:11,222
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

517
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:32,752
Most important, keep things light.

518
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:36,758
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

519
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,361
Am I overdressed?

520
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:42,063
Actually, you look rather dashing.

521
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:45,167
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

522
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:48,573
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

523
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:52,277
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

524
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:55,281
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

525
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:57,884
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

526
00:40:57,985 --> 00:41:02,692
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

527
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:06,998
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am I.

528
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,905
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

529
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:14,209
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

530
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,811
Aren't we all?

531
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:18,716
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

532
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:21,919
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

533
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:26,226
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

534
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,441
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

535
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,544
Or you'll be late for work.

536
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:57,150
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

537
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,154
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

538
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:01,755
All that jazz.

539
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:11,270
You have an appointment?

540
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,573
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

541
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:17,177
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

542
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,282
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

543
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:24,589
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

544
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:36,606
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

545
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:41,012
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

546
00:43:41,112 --> 00:43:43,915
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

547
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:45,918
Milan, darling. Milan.

548
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:49,923
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

549
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:52,426
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

550
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:55,029
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

551
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,034
Feh! I used to design for gods.

552
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:04,944
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

553
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:07,947
E, I just need a patch job.

554
00:44:07,947 --> 00:44:11,253
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

555
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:15,659
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

556
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,063
Moonlighting hero work?

557
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:20,165
Must have happened a long time ago.

558
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:23,369
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

559
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,171
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

560
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:30,277
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

561
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:33,481
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

562
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:36,284
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

563
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,890
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

564
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,394
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

565
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:43,697
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

566
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:46,700
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

567
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,106
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

568
00:44:50,506 --> 00:44:53,210
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

569
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,616
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

570
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:01,921
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

571
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:03,023
No capes!

572
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:08,330
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

573
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,233
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

574
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:14,139
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

575
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,949
All was well, another day saved
when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

576
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:23,351
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

577
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:24,350
Stratogale!

578
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:29,759
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

579
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:32,062
You can't generalize
about these things.

580
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,468
Meta-man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

581
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,672
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

582
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:42,878
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

583
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:44,982
You know I'm retired from hero work.

584
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:48,886
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

585
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:52,791
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

586
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:56,998
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

587
00:45:56,998 --> 00:46:01,501
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

588
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:16,924
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

589
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:19,829
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

590
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:26,739
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

591
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,541
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

592
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:34,147
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

593
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:37,151
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

594
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,054
...duty calls.

595
00:46:46,865 --> 00:46:48,968
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

596
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,574
- Ha... have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

597
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:56,078
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

598
00:46:56,177 --> 00:47:00,483
- So much.
- I love you too.

599
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,605
This is your automated Captain.

600
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:18,908
Would you care for more mimosa?

601
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:22,113
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

602
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:28,322
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

603
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:38,036
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

604
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,775
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

605
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:06,977
Thanks.

606
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:10,480
Nice to be back, Mirage.

607
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:39,621
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

608
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:43,123
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

609
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,725
See you there.

610
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:18,873
Edna.

611
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:21,677
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

612
00:49:21,777 --> 00:49:24,480
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

613
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:27,885
Helen Parr? You know...

614
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:29,789
Elastigirl?

615
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:34,094
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

616
00:49:34,194 --> 00:49:35,898
It's been a while.

617
00:49:35,998 --> 00:49:39,602
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

618
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,805
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

619
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:44,609
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

620
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,413
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

621
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:49,918
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

622
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:53,922
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

623
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:56,828
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

624
00:49:56,928 --> 00:50:00,733
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

625
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,352
Hmm.

626
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,677
It's bigger!

627
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,582
It's badder!

628
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:42,992
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

629
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:47,796
It's finally ready.

630
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:51,900
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

631
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,006
but man, it wasn't good enough!

632
00:50:55,106 --> 00:50:59,211
After you trashed the last one,
I had to make some major modifications.

633
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:02,516
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

634
00:51:02,616 --> 00:51:06,721
I mean, after all,
I am your biggest fan.

635
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:11,428
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

636
00:51:11,628 --> 00:51:13,731
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

637
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:17,436
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

638
00:51:17,537 --> 00:51:21,142
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

639
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:23,845
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

640
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:27,451
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

641
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,753
You can't count on anyone.

642
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:31,758
Especially your heroes.

643
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:34,960
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

644
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,365
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

645
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:40,067
That's the way it works.

646
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:42,870
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

647
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,774
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

648
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:48,478
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

649
00:51:48,577 --> 00:51:52,785
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

650
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:57,492
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

651
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,495
I can't believe it.

652
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:03,901
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

653
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:07,105
I save the best inventions for myself.

654
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:08,908
Am I good enough now?

655
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,012
Who's super now?

656
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:15,017
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

657
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:17,619
Oh, brilliant!

658
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:38,149
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

659
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:15,698
Gazerbeam.

660
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:29,018
"Kronos?"

661
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:58,558
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

662
00:54:02,062 --> 00:54:06,770
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

663
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:11,075
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

664
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:15,081
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

665
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:17,185
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

666
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:20,890
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

667
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:24,894
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

668
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:27,197
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

669
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,302
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

670
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:32,405
That is why I show you my work.

671
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:34,308
That is why you are here.

672
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:43,119
Edna Mode.

673
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:45,524
And guest.

674
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:04,249
Come. Sit.

675
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:11,457
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

676
00:55:11,557 --> 00:55:14,260
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

677
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,267
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

678
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:21,471
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

679
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:26,176
and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

680
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,283
Completely bulletproof.

681
00:55:32,486 --> 00:55:35,191
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

682
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:38,095
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

683
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:42,500
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

684
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,904
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

685
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:48,309
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

686
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:50,411
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

687
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:56,118
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

688
00:55:56,118 --> 00:56:00,525
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

689
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:03,128
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

690
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:08,735
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

691
00:56:11,943 --> 00:56:16,448
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

692
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:19,552
and still retain its shape.

693
00:56:19,552 --> 00:56:21,855
Virtually indestructible...

694
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:25,760
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

695
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,366
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

696
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:33,670
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

697
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:37,376
Well, darling? What do you think?

698
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:42,384
What do I think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

699
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:44,085
Our family is underground.

700
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:47,590
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

701
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:49,793
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

702
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:52,797
Why would he keep secrets from you?

703
00:56:52,897 --> 00:56:55,901
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

704
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:59,606
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

705
00:56:59,506 --> 00:57:01,910
Prone to weakness.

706
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,314
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

707
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:09,220
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

708
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:43,549
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

709
00:58:47,254 --> 00:58:49,659
Are you okay? What happened?

710
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,064
Break surveillance
and engage. Continuing sweep...

711
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:39,609
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

712
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:42,713
Bob Parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

713
01:00:42,814 --> 01:00:47,019
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

714
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,922
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.
- What do you mean?

715
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,627
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

716
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:55,630
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

717
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:29,478
So, you don't know where he is.

718
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,783
Would you like to find out?

719
01:02:51,189 --> 01:02:54,294
I am such an idiot.

720
01:02:54,394 --> 01:02:56,697
I let this happen, you know.

721
01:02:56,797 --> 01:03:00,702
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

722
01:03:00,802 --> 01:03:04,107
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

723
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,913
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

724
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:10,714
What are you talking about?

725
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:16,322
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

726
01:03:16,423 --> 01:03:18,527
What will you do?
Is this a question?

727
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:21,029
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

728
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:24,135
and you will remind him who you are!

729
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:28,842
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

730
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:32,747
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

731
01:03:32,847 --> 01:03:35,351
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

732
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:39,456
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

733
01:03:39,356 --> 01:03:41,256
I should be back tonight. Late.

734
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:43,459
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

735
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:46,263
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

736
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:48,766
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

737
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:53,273
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

738
01:03:53,273 --> 01:03:57,180
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

739
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:06,092
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

740
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,396
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

741
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:10,999
We all get cool outfits?

742
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:13,701
Dash! You come back here this moment!

743
01:04:15,203 --> 01:04:17,606
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

744
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:21,212
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

745
01:04:21,312 --> 01:04:24,216
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

746
01:04:24,317 --> 01:04:27,119
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

747
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,025
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

748
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:34,029
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

749
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:36,333
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

750
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:39,737
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

751
01:04:41,939 --> 01:04:43,943
What makes you think it's special?

752
01:04:44,044 --> 01:04:46,947
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

753
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,865
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

754
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:02,470
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

755
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:05,073
Let me think.

756
01:05:13,485 --> 01:05:16,289
lsland approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

757
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:19,894
VFR on top. Over.

758
01:05:19,994 --> 01:05:22,897
lsland tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

759
01:05:22,697 --> 01:05:26,704
requesting vectors to the initial.

760
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:38,319
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

761
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:43,025
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

762
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:48,133
At the same time. Yeah.

763
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:04,853
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

764
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,856
I was right to idolize you.

765
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:09,460
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

766
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,465
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

767
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:16,971
I'm still geeking out about it!

768
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:20,875
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

769
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:25,884
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

770
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:28,387
Lame, lame, lame.

771
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:33,192
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

772
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:40,703
I am referring to last night
at 2307 hours

773
01:06:40,703 --> 01:06:43,908
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

774
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:47,012
I didn't know about the homing device.

775
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,925
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

776
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:59,129
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.

777
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,031
Play the transmission.

778
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:05,839
- India golf checking in.
- Helen!

779
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,044
So you do know these people.

780
01:07:09,044 --> 01:07:11,848
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.

781
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,453
- Ow!
- Violet!

782
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:17,756
It's not my fault.

783
01:07:17,856 --> 01:07:20,158
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

784
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:21,862
That's not true!

785
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:24,863
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what.

786
01:07:24,963 --> 01:07:28,569
- ...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

787
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,673
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

788
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,478
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

789
01:07:34,578 --> 01:07:36,981
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

790
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:40,185
All right, well, who'd you get?

791
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,588
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

792
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:46,095
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

793
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:49,499
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

794
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,703
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

795
01:07:51,803 --> 01:07:54,807
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

796
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:56,008
Kari...

797
01:07:56,108 --> 01:07:59,009
The beauty is they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

798
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:00,913
I wish my parents played Mozart

799
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:04,217
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

800
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:07,621
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

801
01:08:07,722 --> 01:08:10,927
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

802
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:12,830
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

803
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,534
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

804
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:18,437
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

805
01:08:18,437 --> 01:08:20,440
Who can handle it?

806
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:30,854
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

807
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:32,856
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

808
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:05,502
Repeat, disengage.
Friendlies...

809
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:07,904
No! Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

810
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:12,913
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

811
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:15,917
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

812
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,521
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.

813
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,324
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

814
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,027
You said not to use our powers.

815
01:09:23,127 --> 01:09:25,429
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

816
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,732
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

817
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,142
- Mom?
- Violet!

818
01:09:35,242 --> 01:09:38,246
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

819
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:39,850
There are children aboard.

820
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,956
- There are children aboard!
- No!

821
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:46,960
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.

822
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:48,061
Do it now!

823
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:50,765
Abort, abort, abort!

824
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,771
Abort, abort, abort!

825
01:10:26,113 --> 01:10:27,915
Brace yourselves!

826
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:37,129
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

827
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:39,130
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

828
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,734
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... Look out!

829
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:55,852
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

830
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:58,156
We're dead! We're dead!

831
01:10:58,156 --> 01:11:00,860
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

832
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,262
Stop it!

833
01:11:03,362 --> 01:11:05,165
We are not gonna die!

834
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,069
Both of you will get a grip.

835
01:11:07,169 --> 01:11:09,572
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

836
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:11,475
Understand?

837
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:16,081
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

838
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:18,085
Ah, you'll get over it.

839
01:11:18,185 --> 01:11:21,990
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

840
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:34,206
Release me. Now!

841
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:37,412
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

842
01:11:37,513 --> 01:11:40,216
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

843
01:11:40,316 --> 01:11:43,219
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

844
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:45,022
Show me.

845
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,742
I knew you couldn't do it.

846
01:11:59,842 --> 01:12:03,047
Even when you have nothing to lose.

847
01:12:03,147 --> 01:12:04,751
You're weak.

848
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:06,954
And I've outgrown you.

849
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:20,969
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

850
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:22,671
That way is our best bet.

851
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,676
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

852
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:29,781
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

853
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:33,087
I expect you to trust me.

854
01:13:33,973 --> 01:13:36,076
What a trooper.

855
01:13:36,176 --> 01:13:38,278
I'm so proud of you.

856
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,480
Thanks, Mom.

857
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,192
I think your father is in trouble.

858
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:52,095
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

859
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:53,496
I'm going to look for him.

860
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:56,301
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

861
01:13:56,402 --> 01:13:58,604
- What?
- You heard her.

862
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:04,613
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

863
01:14:04,713 --> 01:14:05,715
Protect it.

864
01:14:05,815 --> 01:14:08,720
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

865
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:11,323
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

866
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:19,133
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

867
01:14:19,234 --> 01:14:22,736
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

868
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:26,341
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

869
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:29,545
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

870
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:31,749
Do not give them that chance.

871
01:14:31,849 --> 01:14:34,053
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

872
01:14:34,153 --> 01:14:38,058
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

873
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:42,464
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

874
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:45,068
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

875
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:49,574
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

876
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:54,480
Mom!

877
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:58,287
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

878
01:14:58,387 --> 01:15:01,792
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

879
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,594
Shh. It isn't your fault.

880
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:07,498
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

881
01:15:07,598 --> 01:15:10,002
But things are different now.

882
01:15:10,202 --> 01:15:13,206
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

883
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:15,711
You have more power than you realize.

884
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,414
Don't think. And don't worry.

885
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:21,016
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

886
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:23,520
It's in your blood.

887
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:03,175
He's not weak, you know.

888
01:16:03,275 --> 01:16:04,378
What?

889
01:16:04,378 --> 01:16:06,681
Valuing life is not weakness.

890
01:16:06,781 --> 01:16:10,387
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

891
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,488
I had everything under control.

892
01:16:12,588 --> 01:16:15,292
And disregarding it is not strength.

893
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:18,097
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

894
01:16:18,197 --> 01:16:20,700
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

895
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:23,706
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

896
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:40,125
Okay, okay, okay.

897
01:17:35,202 --> 01:17:37,104
A rocket?

898
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:32,982
Hey!

899
01:19:30,259 --> 01:19:35,267
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

900
01:19:35,366 --> 01:19:39,271
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?

901
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,275
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

902
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:44,780
Or worse, their marriage.

903
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,884
Their marriage?

904
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:51,490
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

905
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,793
Forget it. You're so immature.

906
01:19:53,793 --> 01:19:56,998
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

907
01:19:57,098 --> 01:20:01,304
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.

908
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:41,457
Cool!

909
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:44,864
Cool!

910
01:20:44,964 --> 01:20:47,264
Roger.
We are ready for launch.

911
01:20:57,379 --> 01:21:01,083
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

912
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,607
ETA two-niner. Over.

913
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:22,313
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

914
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:26,220
Not responding to IFF.

915
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,622
IRCM reads negative.

916
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:31,625
- Bob.
- What?

917
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:32,927
I didn't say anything.

918
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:04,572
Identification, please.

919
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,576
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.
- What?

920
01:22:07,576 --> 01:22:08,677
- It talks!
- What?

921
01:22:08,778 --> 01:22:10,081
There. That one.

922
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,782
Voice key incorrect.

923
01:22:12,383 --> 01:22:16,588
- "Voice key"?
- Voice key incorrect.

924
01:22:16,688 --> 01:22:18,291
Wait a second.

925
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:21,897
- What do we do?
- Run!

926
01:22:21,997 --> 01:22:24,097
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

927
01:22:29,105 --> 01:22:31,508
Intruder alert.

928
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:57,042
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

929
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:59,446
In fact, there's no time at all.

930
01:22:59,546 --> 01:23:01,649
- Please...
- Why are you here?

931
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:06,755
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

932
01:23:06,755 --> 01:23:10,562
Family survived the crash.

933
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:13,666
- They're here on the island!
- They're alive?

934
01:23:27,385 --> 01:23:29,586
- Helen?
- Hello.

935
01:23:29,687 --> 01:23:31,989
You must be Mrs...

936
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,995
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

937
01:23:34,995 --> 01:23:36,497
That's what I was doing.

938
01:23:36,597 --> 01:23:38,000
Let go of me!

939
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,203
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

940
01:23:42,504 --> 01:23:45,108
How could I betray the perfect woman?

941
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:48,314
- Oh, you're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?

942
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:50,216
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

943
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:53,620
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

944
01:23:53,721 --> 01:23:56,023
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

945
01:23:56,123 --> 01:23:59,228
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

946
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,746
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.

947
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,448
- What?
- Stop talking!

948
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:15,452
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

949
01:24:15,452 --> 01:24:18,356
- What?
- Run!

950
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:21,059
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

951
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,663
Show yourself!

952
01:25:24,344 --> 01:25:25,747
Hey!

953
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:34,360
Ha, ha!

954
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,683
I'm alive. Yeah!

955
01:25:54,586 --> 01:25:55,688
Uh-oh.

956
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,989
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

957
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,791
But I didn't want you to worry.

958
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,294
You didn't want me to worry?

959
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:14,195
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

960
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:17,500
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

961
01:27:19,602 --> 01:27:22,406
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

962
01:27:35,025 --> 01:27:36,927
You can't hide from me.

963
01:27:43,236 --> 01:27:45,538
- There you are.
- Hey!

964
01:27:49,845 --> 01:27:52,247
Don't touch my sister!

965
01:27:59,557 --> 01:28:01,660
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

966
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:03,363
Whatever you do, don't stop!

967
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:21,589
Mom! Dad! Hey!

968
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:24,792
Kids.

969
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:26,697
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

970
01:28:26,797 --> 01:28:29,601
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

971
01:28:47,726 --> 01:28:49,526
I love you.

972
01:28:49,526 --> 01:28:51,028
- Wow.
- Whoa.

973
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,752
Time out!

974
01:29:08,554 --> 01:29:11,759
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

975
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,267
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

976
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:21,269
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

977
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,374
And got busy!

978
01:29:24,374 --> 01:29:27,177
It's a whole family of supers.

979
01:29:27,177 --> 01:29:29,481
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

980
01:29:29,481 --> 01:29:31,884
Oh, this is just too good!

981
01:29:31,984 --> 01:29:35,489
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

982
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:40,596
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

983
01:29:40,696 --> 01:29:43,900
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

984
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,905
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

985
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:51,813
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

986
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:54,415
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

987
01:29:54,415 --> 01:29:58,321
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

988
01:29:58,422 --> 01:30:01,926
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

989
01:30:02,026 --> 01:30:05,730
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

990
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:07,132
I'll give them heroics.

991
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,437
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

992
01:30:10,537 --> 01:30:13,942
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

993
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:18,448
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

994
01:30:18,548 --> 01:30:21,353
And when everyone's super...

995
01:30:23,757 --> 01:30:25,560
...no one will be.

996
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,098
Fire at will!

997
01:31:01,307 --> 01:31:03,410
It's overwhelming the tanks.

998
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:05,013
I'm sorry.

999
01:31:05,114 --> 01:31:09,118
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1000
01:31:09,218 --> 01:31:12,923
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1001
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:16,027
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1002
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:17,230
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1003
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:20,035
So caught up in the past that I...

1004
01:31:21,637 --> 01:31:25,543
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1005
01:31:25,543 --> 01:31:28,648
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1006
01:31:28,748 --> 01:31:32,549
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1007
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:35,353
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1008
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:39,959
We need to get back to the mainland.

1009
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:42,563
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1010
01:31:52,578 --> 01:31:54,181
Where are all the guards?

1011
01:31:54,281 --> 01:31:55,783
Go, go!

1012
01:31:59,689 --> 01:32:02,791
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

1013
01:32:19,014 --> 01:32:21,618
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1014
01:32:21,718 --> 01:32:24,724
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1015
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:26,825
How about a rocket?

1016
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:33,936
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1017
01:32:33,936 --> 01:32:36,639
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1018
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:42,146
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1019
01:32:42,246 --> 01:32:44,949
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

1020
01:33:00,773 --> 01:33:02,775
- Honey?
- What?

1021
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,778
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1022
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:08,381
Where is my supersuit?

1023
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:11,485
- I put it away.
- Where?

1024
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,989
Why do you need to know?

1025
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,092
I need it!

1026
01:33:15,192 --> 01:33:18,196
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1027
01:33:18,296 --> 01:33:20,900
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1028
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,704
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1029
01:33:23,803 --> 01:33:27,409
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1030
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,513
"Greater good"? I am your wife!

1031
01:33:29,613 --> 01:33:32,617
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1032
01:33:36,121 --> 01:33:37,521
Run!

1033
01:33:39,324 --> 01:33:40,625
My baby!

1034
01:33:44,932 --> 01:33:47,435
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1035
01:33:47,435 --> 01:33:51,041
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1036
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:55,848
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1037
01:33:58,851 --> 01:34:00,252
All right, stand back.

1038
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:09,264
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1039
01:34:10,866 --> 01:34:12,068
Ha, ha!

1040
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:42,912
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1041
01:34:45,016 --> 01:34:47,219
How you doing, honey?

1042
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:50,022
Do I have to answer?

1043
01:34:52,226 --> 01:34:55,330
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1044
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:01,337
Here we go, honey.

1045
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:05,443
Ready, Violet? Ready?

1046
01:35:05,443 --> 01:35:06,544
Now!

1047
01:35:09,649 --> 01:35:11,152
This is gonna be rough.

1048
01:35:18,661 --> 01:35:20,865
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1049
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:23,268
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1050
01:35:23,368 --> 01:35:25,872
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1051
01:35:25,972 --> 01:35:28,576
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1052
01:35:28,676 --> 01:35:30,578
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1053
01:35:30,578 --> 01:35:32,281
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1054
01:35:32,381 --> 01:35:34,584
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1055
01:36:01,218 --> 01:36:03,923
Is everybody okay back there?

1056
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:07,627
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1057
01:36:10,232 --> 01:36:13,436
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1058
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:16,942
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1059
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:19,743
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1060
01:36:19,844 --> 01:36:22,348
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1061
01:36:22,348 --> 01:36:24,251
I'm with you for better or worse.

1062
01:36:24,251 --> 01:36:26,353
I have to do this alone.

1063
01:36:26,353 --> 01:36:28,156
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1064
01:36:28,256 --> 01:36:30,359
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1065
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:31,959
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1066
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:33,763
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1067
01:36:33,863 --> 01:36:35,866
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1068
01:36:35,866 --> 01:36:37,969
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1069
01:36:38,069 --> 01:36:40,574
I can't lose you again!

1070
01:36:41,575 --> 01:36:44,478
I can't. Not again.

1071
01:36:44,478 --> 01:36:46,882
I'm not... strong enough.

1072
01:36:55,294 --> 01:36:58,198
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1073
01:36:58,298 --> 01:37:00,101
I don't know what'll happen.

1074
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:03,005
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1075
01:37:07,212 --> 01:37:08,914
Vi! Dash! No!

1076
01:37:19,027 --> 01:37:20,028
Violet?

1077
01:37:23,532 --> 01:37:25,935
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1078
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:39,054
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1079
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:51,271
Frozone!

1080
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:55,475
Yeah!

1081
01:37:55,575 --> 01:37:56,575
Bob!

1082
01:37:57,777 --> 01:37:58,680
Hey!

1083
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:16,304
Syndrome's remote!

1084
01:38:26,016 --> 01:38:28,320
The remote controls the robot!

1085
01:38:31,124 --> 01:38:33,628
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!

1086
01:38:44,743 --> 01:38:45,844
Got it!

1087
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,854
Honey, take out its guns!

1088
01:39:00,465 --> 01:39:01,768
Gotcha!

1089
01:39:47,029 --> 01:39:49,033
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1090
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,138
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1091
01:39:56,543 --> 01:39:57,544
The robot?

1092
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:09,258
It's coming back!

1093
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,363
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1094
01:40:13,265 --> 01:40:16,669
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...

1095
01:40:20,175 --> 01:40:21,475
...itself.

1096
01:40:21,475 --> 01:40:22,978
It's getting closer!

1097
01:40:23,078 --> 01:40:25,181
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1098
01:40:26,684 --> 01:40:28,486
It's not doing anything.

1099
01:40:28,486 --> 01:40:30,790
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1100
01:40:35,694 --> 01:40:36,797
Honey!

1101
01:40:43,006 --> 01:40:45,408
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1102
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:51,015
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!

1103
01:40:51,015 --> 01:40:53,419
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1104
01:40:53,419 --> 01:40:56,224
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1105
01:40:56,224 --> 01:40:58,026
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1106
01:40:58,026 --> 01:41:00,530
- Hang on!
- What are you waiting for?

1107
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:02,833
A closer target! You got one shot!

1108
01:41:06,438 --> 01:41:07,940
Everybody duck!

1109
01:41:30,872 --> 01:41:32,075
Hey, Zone.

1110
01:41:38,184 --> 01:41:40,484
Huh? No!

1111
01:41:40,584 --> 01:41:44,591
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1112
01:41:44,691 --> 01:41:48,897
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1113
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:55,106
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1114
01:41:55,106 --> 01:41:57,410
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1115
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:02,817
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1116
01:42:02,918 --> 01:42:06,520
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1117
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:09,025
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1118
01:42:09,025 --> 01:42:10,925
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1119
01:42:10,925 --> 01:42:12,927
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1120
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:16,533
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1121
01:42:16,533 --> 01:42:17,734
You did good, Bob.

1122
01:42:17,834 --> 01:42:19,737
Hi, this is Kari.

1123
01:42:19,837 --> 01:42:22,741
I have a question about Jack-Jack...

1124
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:24,545
Come on. We're in a limo.

1125
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:27,550
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1126
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:30,452
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1127
01:42:30,552 --> 01:42:33,257
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1128
01:42:33,257 --> 01:42:35,861
Not as cool as you running on water.

1129
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:39,466
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1130
01:42:39,466 --> 01:42:42,371
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1131
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:45,273
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.

1132
01:42:45,373 --> 01:42:48,878
Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.

1133
01:42:48,977 --> 01:42:52,584
Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!

1134
01:42:52,584 --> 01:42:54,186
When are you coming back?

1135
01:42:54,286 --> 01:42:56,689
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us!

1136
01:42:56,789 --> 01:43:00,794
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1137
01:43:00,895 --> 01:43:03,799
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1138
01:43:03,899 --> 01:43:06,603
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1139
01:43:06,703 --> 01:43:08,906
I need help, Mrs...

1140
01:43:09,006 --> 01:43:10,708
Bob, listen to this.

1141
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:12,811
I'm gonna call the police...

1142
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:14,313
Hi, this is Kari.

1143
01:43:14,414 --> 01:43:18,620
Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.

1144
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,724
Thanks for sending a replacement.

1145
01:43:20,824 --> 01:43:23,527
I didn't call a replacement.

1146
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:31,339
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1147
01:43:33,743 --> 01:43:36,043
You took away my future.

1148
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:39,548
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1149
01:43:39,548 --> 01:43:42,853
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1150
01:43:42,953 --> 01:43:46,857
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1151
01:43:51,065 --> 01:43:54,369
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1152
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:11,294
What's happening?

1153
01:44:17,201 --> 01:44:20,403
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1154
01:44:24,609 --> 01:44:26,111
Throw me.

1155
01:44:30,217 --> 01:44:31,619
Bob, throw me!

1156
01:44:37,928 --> 01:44:38,928
No!

1157
01:44:41,633 --> 01:44:45,137
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1158
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:46,541
I'll get your son!

1159
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:49,546
Oh, no.

1160
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:04,664
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1161
01:45:04,764 --> 01:45:07,367
Everything is all right.

1162
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:23,891
That's my girl.

1163
01:45:24,592 --> 01:45:27,296
Does this mean we have to move again?

1164
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:31,902
Oh, man.

1165
01:45:31,902 --> 01:45:34,707
That was totally wicked!

1166
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:54,535
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1167
01:45:54,635 --> 01:45:57,737
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1168
01:45:57,737 --> 01:45:59,341
- Hey.
- Hey.

1169
01:45:59,341 --> 01:46:01,944
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1170
01:46:02,044 --> 01:46:03,946
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1171
01:46:04,046 --> 01:46:07,352
I feel different. Is different okay?

1172
01:46:07,452 --> 01:46:10,655
Hey, different is...
Different is great.

1173
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:13,059
Would you...

1174
01:46:13,059 --> 01:46:14,763
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1175
01:46:14,763 --> 01:46:16,665
- ...you and I...
- Yeah?

1176
01:46:16,765 --> 01:46:18,068
- Do you...
- Shh.

1177
01:46:18,168 --> 01:46:20,971
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1178
01:46:21,071 --> 01:46:24,877
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1179
01:46:24,977 --> 01:46:27,778
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1180
01:46:31,784 --> 01:46:34,987
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1181
01:46:34,987 --> 01:46:37,391
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1182
01:46:37,492 --> 01:46:38,794
Run!

1183
01:46:38,894 --> 01:46:40,295
Move it, move it!

1184
01:46:40,295 --> 01:46:43,200
Pace it.
Slow down just a little bit.

1185
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,103
- Make it close!
- Second.

1186
01:46:46,204 --> 01:46:48,507
Close second, yeah!

1187
01:46:52,112 --> 01:46:54,416
That's my boy!

1188
01:46:54,516 --> 01:46:56,719
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1189
01:46:56,819 --> 01:46:59,420
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1190
01:47:11,137 --> 01:47:14,142
Behold the Underminer!

1191
01:47:14,643 --> 01:47:17,146
I am always beneath you,

1192
01:47:17,246 --> 01:47:20,752
but nothing is beneath me!

1193
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:26,759
I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!

1194
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:31,467
Soon all will tremble before me!
