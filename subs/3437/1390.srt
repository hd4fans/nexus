THE NEST

3
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,630
The Pepsis
or 'Tarantula Hawk Wasp'...

4
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,420
... is one of the biggest existing wasps
with a wingspan of 12 cm.

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,760
This predator...

6
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,040
... also likes the nectar
of certain flowers in the Amazon.

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,840
It kills its victims by laying
an egg in them...

8
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,550
... and hence it's not a real parasite,
but a parasitoid.

9
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,220
It drags the spider to its burrow...

10
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,470
... and waits until the poison
has completely paralysed the spider.

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,890
It then lays its eggs on top
of the immobilised victim.

12
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,390
The larvae feed on the still
living tarantula...

13
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,220
... from the inside.

14
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,430
Suburb of Strasbourg

15
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,340
Thursday July 14

16
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,150
The landing procedure has been iniated.

17
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,060
We're landing in few moments.

18
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,440
Hello.

19
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,450
More than friends... family.
- How's your baby?

20
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,440
Look.

21
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,190
Just as pretty as her mother.
- Keep it.

22
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,310
And your daughters, Giovanni ?
- The oldest is a disaster.

23
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,700
She always wants to sleep
with Gina and me.

24
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,990
Here.

25
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,440
What's that?

26
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,030
Information about that asshole.
We followed him to Germany.

27
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,690
The trial is going
to be a big fuss.

28
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,030
Hi, Tony.

29
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,120
Hurry up.

30
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,910
Not for me.

31
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't want that.

32
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,960
When can I come?
- That's up to your brother.

33
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,670
Colmar, military airport.

34
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,970
Secured.

35
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,670
Northeast-Albania

36
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,760
It will be fine.
We'll use silencers.

37
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,390
Strasbourg - Industrial Park

38
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,100
Jesus, you're always late.
Even Spitz is already here.

39
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,270
You try the nightshift, asshole.

40
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,480
National Highway 83

41
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,350
Captain, they just went up
the A35.

42
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,360
Tomorrow, the trial of Abedin Nexhep
starts in Strasbourg...

43
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,990
... the suspected leader
of the Albanian mafia.

44
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
He's under suspicion of trade in women...

45
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,030
... weapons and assault.

46
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,700
A report of Gilles Dupa
from Strasbourg.

47
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,280
In Eastern-Europe Nexhep is the
key figure of an immense mafia network.

48
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,870
He has been arrested during
a business trip to Germany...

49
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,830
... thanks to a cooperation between
the German, Italian and French police.

50
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,240
The trial being held in Strasbourg
has a symbolic meaning.

51
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,990
Strasbourg - Industrial Park

52
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,280
Are you scared?

53
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,830
Who do you think you are?
You're the woman here.

54
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,160
You can sit in front of the computer,
that's it.

55
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,290
And if you're nice, who knows...

56
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,330
Selim, don't even think about it.
I don't like you.

57
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,620
Go on, Martial.

58
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,500
Slavery is the right word.

59
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,080
They're stuck in a totalitarian system
and have no way to get out.

60
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,200
Some girls even have a number
burned in their skin.

61
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,630
As if they're merchandise, not people.

62
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,960
A girl
that tried to escape...

63
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,500
... was shot in her legs.

64
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,870
What do you want with a gun?
You're crazy.

65
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,620
Do Nasser and Santino know?
- Shut up.

66
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,750
You're scared.
- You're starting to loose control, Nadia.

67
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,960
Sissy.

68
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,170
Put that light out.

69
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,260
Martial was a good idea.

70
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,720
Believe me, Santi.
We'll never go to prison again.

71
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,960
We'll soon be lying in the sun.

72
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,890
no reception

73
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,760
Lieutenant Laborie.

74
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,050
All traffic is jammed
because of an accident.

75
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,840
Change route.
Warn headquarters.

76
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,360
And there they are,
the Parisian fire brigade...

77
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,480
... which recently suffered
severe losses.

78
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,730
One colleague died on July 7
in a gas explosion.

79
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,780
And two colleagues...

80
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,820
Louis, why did you leave
the fire brigade?

81
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,350
They're true soldiers.

82
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,450
Stop it.
It gets to you.

83
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,120
Santi?
- What?

84
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,870
Fuck you.

85
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,120
Fuck you too.

86
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,700
Here's some ammo.

87
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,670
Hold your dog or I'll shoot.
- He's tied up.

88
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,040
Quiet. Get up.

89
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,170
Don't move.
- Take my gun.

90
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,630
Take it.

91
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,880
Take his gun damned.

92
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,760
Get up.
- Outside.

93
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,550
Don't try to fool us.
- We're no heroes.

94
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,710
Everything alright?
Did you tie them up well?

95
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,010
Martial was good, eh?
What an acrobat.

96
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,260
Go stand on the lookout.
Now you can prove yourself.

97
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,180
Roadwork?

98
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,090
The road has just been asphalted.
How can I get home now?

99
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,890
You'll let me pass or...

100
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,680
Down, down.

101
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,930
Here.

102
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,550
Is it working?
- We're almost there. Farther, farther.

103
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,810
That's it.

104
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,970
P20, P21...

105
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,270
Thank you, Santa Claus.

106
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,720
That's a whole pallet.
- Two pallets.

107
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,860
Start.

108
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,080
Captain, we've lost contact
with the armoured car.

109
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,200
Understood Captain.

110
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,790
Fuck.

111
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,580
Shit.

112
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:26,080
Headquarters for Anemone 12.
Do you read me?

113
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,500
It's no computer malfunction.
- Call major Gir閟.

114
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,830
He's in Paris, at the defile.

115
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,080
Colonel Fabre then.
- Also in Paris.

116
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,790
Anemone 12, do you read me?

117
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,960
There's someone at that warehouse.

118
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,420
Someone's coming.
Probably cops.

119
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,500
Quiet, calm.

120
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,500
It's the cops.

121
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,750
This way.

122
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,590
This way.

123
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,340
Anemone 12...

124
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,960
Shit.

125
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,730
A special squad.

126
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,980
No.
- Who then?

127
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,520
Nasser?

128
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,140
There.

129
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,860
Get down.

130
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,100
Fuckers.

131
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,070
Everything ok?
- Yes.

132
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,290
You too?
- Yes.

133
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,370
Our driver is dead.

134
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,630
Police. Don't move.

135
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,590
Who are those guys outside?

136
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,830
Don't move.
- Don't shoot.

137
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,210
Hands up.
- Don't shoot.

138
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,420
Hands on your head.

139
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,340
It's all my fault.
- No, it isn't.

140
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,080
Hands up.
- Calm now.

141
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,590
Take it.
- I'm dying of pain.

142
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,420
I'm scared.
- We're going to make it.

143
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,920
We'll get out of this.

144
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:13,510
I'm scared. Hold me.
- I'm holding you.

145
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,470
Let me.

146
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,050
Santi?
- I'm here.

147
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,630
Don't move.

148
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,050
Squeeze my hand.

149
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,760
Do you feel anything?
- Nothing.

150
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,710
I'm fucked up.

151
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,880
No, you're not.

152
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,340
I'll be in a wheelchair.

153
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,300
I don't want that.
- I'll stay with you.

154
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,470
I don't want that.
- Stay calm.

155
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,750
I'm so cold.
- You're strong.

156
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,300
I'm so cold.

157
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,630
He's dead.
- No, unconscious.

158
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,510
I swear I won't leave you.

159
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,260
I'll get my first aid kid.

160
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,850
What do those guys outside want?

161
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,670
What do they want?

162
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,510
A prisoner.
- No concern of ours.

163
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,600
Let's leave here.

164
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:19,260
They probably won't like that.
- That's our problem.

165
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,730
We can't move Nasser like this.

166
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,890
We have to get out of here.
- Selim is right.

167
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,850
If we move him now,
he'll die. Understand?

168
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,190
Nasser is my buddy too.
But he said himself:

169
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,850
If something goes wrong, get out.

170
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,510
Look for yourself,
he's dying.

171
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:24,310
You should be ashamed.
And you have a short-term memory.

172
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,270
Here are the keys.
Get lost.

173
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,520
What is it? You want to go with him, Nadia?
Run away, cowards.

174
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:37,110
It's not running away.
- What is it then? I'm staying here.

175
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,930
I'm staying too.

176
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,140
So what are you going to do?

177
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,020
He's not the problem.

178
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,020
That guy in the car is.

179
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,020
He's what they want.

180
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,100
Hey, cop.
- What are you doing?

181
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,940
Let that guy go.
- Never.

182
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,390
Fire, bitch.

183
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,020
Drop your gun.

184
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,230
This way.

185
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,100
Upstairs.

186
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,990
This way.

187
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,530
Inside.

188
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,110
Listen up.

189
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,490
Do you read me, Giovanni?
- Yes.

190
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,290
Someone must have heard the alarm.
- I hope so.

191
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,870
Who are all those dead guys?

192
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,790
He's cold.

193
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,120
It'll be fine.
- I can't feel anything.

194
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,490
He can't move.

195
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,910
Let me know if it hurts.

196
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,750
Santi, let us go home,
please.

197
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,290
You can't move.

198
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,880
I want a blanket.
- I'll get you one.

199
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,580
It's so cold in here.

200
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,500
What's he doing?

201
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,710
Santi, we must get him out of here.

202
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,960
This leads to the canal.
But it's very narrow.

203
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,750
He's an incredible acrobat,
both in the air and underground.

204
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,120
Isn't that right, Martial ?

205
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,710
Are you hurt? Let me see.

206
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,840
Your friend isn't going to make it.
He must be somewhere warm and quiet.

207
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:13,010
In the control room.
Your wound isn't serious.

208
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,290
This is for him.

209
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,890
Giovanni?

210
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,970
How much ammo have you got left?

211
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,130
Look outside. What do you see?

212
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,180
Nothing. Why?

213
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:34,340
They removed their casualties.

214
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:45,890
From a distance it seems like
nothing is going on here.

215
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,350
Giovanni agrees
to give them weapons.

216
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,840
Only you can decide that.

217
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:04,890
I'm asking your opinion.
- Giovanni and I are not allowed to have one.

218
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,720
Don't hide behind orders
like that bulletproof mask.

219
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,390
You're getting emotional.

220
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,600
Fuck you.

221
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:44,850
You're all going to die.
Understand?

222
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,060
They'll kill you.

223
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:54,890
You don't frighten me.
I won't have mercy on you either.

224
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,350
A woman...

225
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,520
can you handle this?

226
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,440
Give me.

227
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,480
It's all hands on deck.
Take it.

228
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,810
And no joking around.

229
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,800
Or you'll have me to deal with.
- Oh yeah?

230
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,390
Can you handle this?

231
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:40,850
Safety pin off.

232
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,230
Check...

233
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,680
... and aim with your laser.

234
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,060
Haven't you got anything else for me?

235
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,980
Shut up.
- Stupid bitch.

236
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,430
What are you doing?

237
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,490
We're all in the same shit.

238
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,060
Hey, you there.

239
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,440
Come down and get this on.

240
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:50,860
Have you got any weapons?
- A short rifle.

241
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:53,270
Get him.

242
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:11,320
Don't shoot. I'm the security guard.

243
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,940
Do you have a gun?
- No.

244
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,360
Take it.
- I'm not a part of this.

245
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,770
I have to watch my screens.

246
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:29,530
What's your name?
- Spitz.

247
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:35,030
Make yourself useful, Spitz,
and put on this vest.

248
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,860
Warn me immediately if something
moves on your screens.

249
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:42,700
Come on.

250
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,660
Careful with his head.

251
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,750
Are you managing?

252
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,070
Turn.

253
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,200
Lower, lower.

254
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,910
Managing?
- Let it go.

255
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,000
Where's Martial?
- Gone for help.

256
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,420
Hang in there.

257
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:43,330
Don't worry,
we'll be lying in the sun soon.

258
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,750
What's that?

259
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,960
Don't be foolish. Come back.

260
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:15,670
Come back, Spitz.
- Don't shoot. I surrender.

261
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,090
I surrender.

262
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,090
Don't shoot.

263
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,010
Get out, bastard.

264
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,760
Out of the way
- Put him back right now.

265
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,140
Lower those weapons.

266
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,140
They can have their leader.
This has to stop.

267
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,720
Get back.
- Shut up.

268
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,970
Get out of the way
or I'll shoot him.

269
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:47,880
Do you know who that asshole is?
He raped hundreds of women.

270
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,680
I don't give a damn.

271
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,380
Is that clear?

272
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:59,380
You don't understand, Selim.
That guy stays here.

273
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,800
Put him back.
- What's wrong with you?

274
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,920
Back.

275
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,970
What's in there?

276
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,140
Goddamned.

277
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,310
Let go.

278
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,650
Is that your kid?

279
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:39,570
A cute one. How old is he?

280
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,900
Exactly one year.

281
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:48,240
I have a son too.
My mother looks after him.

282
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:51,360
How old is he?
- Six.

283
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:54,360
A big one.

284
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,900
And his dad?

285
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:06,440
I wanted to do it on my own.
- I didn't.

286
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,990
No.

287
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,490
Northeast. Movement at ten o'clock.

288
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,820
Southeast. Movement at nine o'clock.

289
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,070
Movement at three o'clock.
- And at five o'clock.

290
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,870
Shit, we'll never make it.

291
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,150
They're regrouping.
- They're going to slaughter us.

292
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:03,780
They're coming in either way.
- We must buy some time.

293
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:07,490
If we take cover here,
we can overlook everything.

294
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,950
Not enough cover.

295
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,200
But what else?

296
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,110
I don't know.

297
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:26,330
We'll build a wall of containers.
Bullets won't go through it.

298
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,400
With loopholes.
- We're building a container wall.

299
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,160
All exits have to be sealed.
That will stop them for a while.

300
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,370
How much ammo do we have left?
- Ten magazines.

301
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,410
I've got two.
- One box of shells.

302
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,700
I've got eight bullets.

303
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,990
That's not much.

304
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,070
Shall we do it?

305
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:54,870
You stay here.

306
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,750
I have a plan to buy us some time
and get help.

307
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:18,500
What is it?
- I'll escape.

308
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:23,120
I know what I'm doing.
You'll just have to trust me.

309
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,670
I'm coming with you.

310
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:41,040
We haven't got enough chains.
Take that forklift truck.

311
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,790
To the right.

312
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,460
I'm coming back for you, Nasser.
I swear.

313
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,960
With an ambulance.

314
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,000
You know, Selim...

315
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,990
You handled it alright.
I blew it.

316
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:02,290
No you didn't.

317
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,830
Take good care of her.

318
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,160
We're counting on you.

319
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,210
I'll be fine.

320
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,670
Good luck.

321
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,920
Drive.

322
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:29,430
Connect, come on connect.

323
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:52,340
It won't stop, damned.

324
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:55,800
Calm down.
- I want to go home.

325
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:03,630
It's my fault, my fault.

326
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,930
I'm staying here
to guard that motherfucker.

327
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,140
Slut.
- No you're the slut.

328
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:16,720
When I was a little girl...

329
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,640
... a dog like you beat me...

330
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:22,440
... and dumped his seed in me.

331
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,100
I have sworn
I would crack his balls some day.

332
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,010
What are you doing?

333
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:37,600
You're hurting me. Stop it.

334
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,980
That's no use. Get lost.

335
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,750
Down there.

336
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,580
Come one.
- I'm staying with him.

337
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,080
You have to go with them.
- No.

338
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:57,470
The cellar is our only chance.
- Leave a weapon behind.

339
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,960
Four bullets.
- Come on.

340
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:06,750
Get out of here.

341
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,510
Nasser...

342
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:18,710
Go on, Santi. Go on.

343
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:32,130
I'm dying.

344
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,340
You won't leave, will you?

345
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:37,790
Nonsense, you're not dying.

346
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,830
Let's go.

347
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,510
We're all going to die.

348
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,720
The sun, brother.

349
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,800
The sun...

350
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:42,970
Turn around.

351
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,970
Come.

352
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,390
Make sure it's spread everywhere.

353
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,350
They're coming.

354
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:12,970
Inside.

355
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,630
But what about you?

356
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,840
I'll be fine.

357
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,720
I'll be fine.

358
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,440
Beat it.
This is a secured area.

359
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,440
It's an inferno, bodies everywhere.

360
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:11,360
Are there any survivors?

361
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:14,350
Get out of here, son. It's too dangerous.

362
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:20,020
Captain?
Some survivors have been found.

363
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,820
Go away.
