1
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,933
What's wrong, miss?

2
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,605
I have a flat tire.

3
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,638
Drive to the side first.
Don't block the road.

4
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:53,236
Sorry, I need to make a call first.

5
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,132
Hurry. You're blocking the traffic.

6
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,401
Outrageous!

7
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,268
Send someone to help me.

8
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,935
I'm at Yin Chong Street.

9
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:20,035
y car is blocking the road.

10
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,591
Move the canvas, old man.

11
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,424
It's from upstairs!

12
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,227
Hello, police? I'm atYin Chong Street.

13
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:54,195
A man was hit by falling glass.

14
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,889
Police is on its way.

15
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,529
Sir, over here.

16
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:17,829
Mister, what's your name?

17
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:19,019
Help me.

18
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:22,660
Control, is ambulance on its way?

19
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,229
...and he collapsed here.

20
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,788
What's wrong with your car?

21
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,062
I have a flat tire.

22
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,696
We need to clear the street
for the ambulance.

23
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,128
What should I do?

24
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,921
You can still move your car. Hurry!

25
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:44,759
How?

26
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,152
Release the handbrake.
We'll push from behind.

27
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,384
Mister, hang in there.

28
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,051
Ambulance is coming.

29
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:28,191
Mister!

30
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,651
He is dead.

31
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,347
Fatty, collect the payment.

32
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,352
"one message"

33
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,115
According to the police,

34
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,749
this was a falling object accident.

35
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,475
Our source reveals the victim...

36
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,208
...is a Triad gang boss.

37
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:48,849
The victim is a Triad boss.

38
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:50,943
OCTB is taking over...

39
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,883
...the investigation.

40
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:55,847
Police has no further comments
at this moment...

41
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,678
Worried?

42
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,574
Howwill police conduct...

43
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:10,318
... the investigation?

44
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,848
There was no evidence to indicate murder.

45
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:19,582
They'll conclude it was an accident.

46
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,878
The cigarette butt has your saliva.

47
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:24,481
But I'm clean.

48
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,808
I've never been arrested.

49
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,448
They won't suspect me.

50
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,813
Remember how many jobs we've done?

51
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:38,445
We've always been discrete.

52
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,510
But you slipped this time.

53
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:44,314
If the police finds you,
they'll trace it to us.

54
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,311
Our jobs will no longer
appear as accidents,

55
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:50,278
but murders.

56
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,672
You can't go back now.

57
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,539
I picked up the cigarette for you.

58
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:04,544
You got me.

59
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,276
Brain must notfind out about this.

60
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,068
I want to play.

61
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,942
I meet clients, I collect payments,

62
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,443
My job comes with risks.

63
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:55,237
Why are you keeping secrets from me?

64
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,273
We have no secrets.

65
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:01,634
He's one of us. Tell him.

66
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,208
I left a cigarette butt at the scene.

67
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:07,000
But I have it now.
Brain doesn't have to know.

68
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,038
How careless of you.
It's fine now.

69
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,170
Well done.

70
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,007
Why did you lie?

71
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,065
What do you mean?

72
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,302
Why tell Uncle to lie?

73
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,835
I was trying to stop him
from going back to the scene.

74
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,902
How can I ever trust you again?

75
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,535
Should we go our separate ways?

76
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,705
Butwe've been partners for so long.

77
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,434
You are working for me.

78
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:44,899
Don't let mistakes jeopardize our safety.

79
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:54,966
Everyone, I've quit smoking for good!

80
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,335
There's always someone watching.

81
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,898
We're not the only ones in this trade.

82
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,702
Any mistake

83
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,959
can cost our lives.

84
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,553
How are you?

85
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:47,120
"Namo-Amitabha"

86
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:19,549
Mr. Wong?

87
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:21,049
This is he. Are you...

88
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:24,514
Yes. Turn into Ap Liu Street.

89
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,617
Stop.

90
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:35,542
Take the plastic bag in the trash can.

91
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,810
Keep walking.
Put all your belongings in the bag.

92
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,345
Yourwallet and cell phone.

93
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,842
Everything.

94
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,909
What next?
Do you see No. 165?

95
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,212
Go to the sixth floor.

96
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:09,514
Put the phone in the bag. Toss it.

97
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:00,978
Looks delicious.

98
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,245
Thanks.

99
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,075
Morning.

100
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,875
What's the son's motive?

101
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:51,873
An old grudge?

102
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:56,901
Inheritance money? Insurance scam?

103
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,506
Doesn't matter to us.

104
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:15,670
"Wing Wah Pawnshop"

105
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,400
Sorry I'm late.

106
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:36,633
Does electric leakage happen to trams?

107
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:40,101
No. Trams run on direct current.

108
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,466
What if we tip over the tram
to kill the target?

109
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:46,566
How?

110
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:50,101
It's difficult. Keep thinking.

111
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:53,830
We could kill him from up close.

112
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:59,035
Liking firing poison dart from an umbrella.
But that won't look like an accident.

113
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,161
How about electrocution through
the tram track?

114
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:13,101
We could connect a wire...

115
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:14,527
...from the tram's inverter to the track.

116
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,396
But that'll blow the tram's fuse.

117
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,296
And where do you place the inverter
on the tram?

118
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,298
Think of something else.

119
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,093
How about a car crash?

120
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,062
No. The street is too crowded.

121
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,330
How about at night?

122
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:34,830
I said no.

123
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:36,832
Use electricity.

124
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:43,922
Electrocution only works...

125
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,598
...when the tram's cable is connected
to the track.

126
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,096
How can it work?
How to get target into position?

127
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,026
That's very hard.

128
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,858
We're on the right direction.
Keep thinking.

129
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,429
I got a hot dog for you.

130
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:38,027
Electrocution.

131
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:41,324
Tram cable.

132
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,522
If we hang a wire from the cable,

133
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:54,260
target will come in contact
with it when crossing the track.

134
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,585
How will it conduct electricity?

135
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:58,319
Will the wire conduct electricity?

136
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,091
Rain.

137
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:06,287
Water conducts electricity.

138
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,662
How do we hang a wire from the cable?

139
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,092
We'll fly it.

140
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,459
Hard to fly it in rain!

141
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,050
Keep practising.

142
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,552
Forecast predicted rain tonight.

143
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:02,353
If it does, we'll take action.

144
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:56,844
No rain.

145
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,483
Abort.

146
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,179
Abort.

147
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,274
Get ready.

148
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,675
Wait.

149
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,678
A car accident is holding me up.

150
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,709
I need to come from another side.

151
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:57,773
Fatty, are you in position? Almost.

152
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:14,580
Abort.

153
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,439
Uncle, why are you smoking?

154
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:55,635
Why can't I during work? Leave me alone.

155
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:58,401
But you quit already.

156
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:02,444
I did?

157
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:05,305
Why would I do that?

158
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,341
Uncle is ill.

159
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:14,541
Mind you words, fatso.

160
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:21,171
Uncle is not well. Should we abort?

161
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:24,071
I'm fine. There's no problem.

162
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:33,065
What should we do?

163
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:54,599
Uncle.

164
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:56,600
Can you do it?

165
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,366
Yes. Why not?

166
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,864
Are you sure?

167
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,337
Yes.

168
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,131
Action.

169
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:04,428
Heavy rain.

170
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,664
Have you cut the line?

171
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,364
Yes.

172
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,400
It's approaching position.

173
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:58,958
Fatty.

174
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,091
Uncle didn't release the balloons.

175
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:09,734
Balloons? What balloons?

176
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,565
Uncle.

177
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,828
The camera can't see you in the rain.

178
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:20,891
Go.

179
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,363
I trust you.

180
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,758
Find Uncle immediately.

181
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:13,783
Was this an accident?

182
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,316
Are you a tenant here?

183
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:03,951
Yes. What is it?

184
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,020
Are you Mr. Ho?

185
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:11,615
Your flat was broken into.

186
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:20,144
Mr. Ho, your door was opened...

187
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:22,118
...so I called the police.

188
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,545
Thank you.

189
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:29,744
Mr. Ho, we need to see your lD.

190
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:39,407
"Ho Kwok-fai".
Mr. Ho, please take off your hood.

191
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,211
Thanks. Report to Control.

192
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:54,178
Control, I need a Code-Five.

193
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,575
Send.

194
00:37:55,951 --> 00:38:00,814
Male Ho Kwok-fai, lD# A337287(.4).

195
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:02,180
Over.

196
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,940
What time did you leave home today?
Did you see anyone suspicious?

197
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:11,343
No.

198
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:14,478
I left home early this morning.

199
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:18,605
You can check your belongings.

200
00:38:29,216 --> 00:38:30,147
Notwanted.

201
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:31,406
Roger.

202
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:39,672
Mr. Ho, here's your lD.

203
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:41,676
Thank you.

204
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,403
Do you want to contact your family?

205
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:46,575
No, thanks.

206
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,804
Other flats in this building...

207
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:51,038
...were also broken into.

208
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,240
This was not an accident.

209
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,211
The number you're trying to reach...

210
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:32,234
...is not available at this moment.

211
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:53,138
A deadly car accident took place
at North Point last night.

212
00:39:53,345 --> 00:39:57,367
A bus lost control and left 2 dead
and 8 injured.

213
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,041
The accident happened at approximately
10:30 PM

214
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,504
The 102 Bus was on its way...

215
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:03,634
... to Mei Foo

216
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:07,503
when it lost control
and ran up to the sidewalk.

217
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:10,900
The bus driver...

218
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,939
...is still unconscious.

219
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:17,468
Initial police investigation indicated
it was an accident.

220
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:22,657
I'm worried about you.

221
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:54,917
Abort.

222
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:56,389
We're done here?

223
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:01,291
Aren't we waiting for rain?

224
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:04,689
Fine, abort.

225
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:22,313
Your place?

226
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,056
Sometimes.

227
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,287
How long have you been ill?

228
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:38,889
I'm fine.

229
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:46,223
Wait, am l?

230
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:03,587
I can't recall.

231
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:13,811
How did I become forgetful?

232
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:23,284
I can't remember things I have done.

233
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:31,952
We've known each other. Your wife...

234
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:34,445
She was killed by a speeding car.

235
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:39,681
It was terrible.

236
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:44,717
But I believe in you.
Someone wanted you dead.

237
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:48,184
It was a set-up.

238
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:05,341
You took them already.

239
00:47:10,886 --> 00:47:12,010
When do we start work?

240
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,240
Keep your eyes on that position.
What's the job?

241
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,373
Woman will contact you.

242
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,140
Who's the target?

243
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,748
I'll tell you later.

244
00:48:20,882 --> 00:48:23,370
Yes, it's taken care of.

245
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:07,239
"For Rent"

246
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,874
How long has it been vacant?

247
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:16,165
Not long. About a month.

248
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,530
Who was the last tenant?

249
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:22,900
An old couple lived here for years.

250
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:25,203
The wife passed away.

251
00:50:29,074 --> 00:50:34,335
Here is the key.
I'll bring you the rental contract later.

252
00:51:48,303 --> 00:51:49,393
Sunny Diner.

253
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,695
I want to order take-out.

254
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,596
Is this a prank?

255
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:25,797
"Mr. Chan Fong-Chow"

256
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:20,429
"Commence surveillance."

257
00:53:56,296 --> 00:54:00,023
Did I screw up?
I remember about the balloons.

258
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:05,153
The job is done. Don't worry.

259
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:10,791
No, I remember about the balloons.

260
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:11,519
Uncle.

261
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:13,227
What?

262
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:25,250
It's better not to remember.

263
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:27,621
Really?

264
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:30,787
Goodnight.

265
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,878
Where are you?

266
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:36,668
I'm collecting the payment. You?

267
00:58:48,746 --> 00:58:51,303
How do you know who to contact?

268
00:58:51,512 --> 00:58:54,034
Fatty told me about the client.

269
00:58:54,912 --> 00:58:57,742
I'm replacing him to collect the payment
for all of us.

270
00:58:57,945 --> 00:59:01,842
Fatty couldn't have told you.
You followed him.

271
00:59:02,211 --> 00:59:03,801
What are you talking about?

272
00:59:05,612 --> 00:59:08,134
How did Fatty die?
It was an accident.

273
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:13,072
No. The bus was after me.

274
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:15,675
It was a set-up.

275
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,502
It was an accident. 2 dead and 8 injured.

276
00:59:21,744 --> 00:59:25,937
We both know all accidents can be staged.

277
00:59:26,243 --> 00:59:28,140
Are you suspecting me?

278
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,069
Who ordered the hit?

279
00:59:32,143 --> 00:59:34,836
No one. I don't know.

280
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,607
Who is the insurance agent?

281
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:41,468
You're making everything up.

282
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:45,433
You're lying. Stop fooling yourself.

283
00:59:49,009 --> 00:59:53,100
I thought you'd believe in me.

284
00:59:56,308 --> 00:59:57,205
Who ordered the hit?

285
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,030
You're crazy.

286
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,438
You betrayed me.

287
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,196
Damn you!

288
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:14,665
We can't approve the money
before the procedure is completed.

289
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,764
I have to ask my boss.

290
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,827
I'm following up with Mr. Wong's case.

291
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:52,092
How about the other client?

292
01:01:54,035 --> 01:01:56,125
The old man.

293
01:01:57,602 --> 01:02:01,658
I've told you he fell out of a window
from the second floor.

294
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:25,696
"Flawless. Clever Man."

295
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:59,154
Mom, you also read it in the papers?

296
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,515
Yes, the victim's father was my client.

297
01:05:04,257 --> 01:05:07,222
I met him on the day he killed himself.

298
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:10,355
When he gave me
his father's death certificate,

299
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:16,054
he acted strange
and kept saying he was sorry.

300
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:18,844
Someone saw him...

301
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,782
...taking the elevator to the rooftop.

302
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:25,487
Right, I shouldn't have let him...

303
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,322
...Ieave the office alone.
"Did Mr. Wong kill himself?"

304
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,583
...Ieave the office alone.
"Did Mr. Wong kill himself?"

305
01:05:33,822 --> 01:05:35,753
I'll pick you up afterwork.

306
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:40,287
Call me. We can have dinnertogether.

307
01:05:40,555 --> 01:05:43,714
What do you want to eat?

308
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:52,776
You're messing it up. I'll do it myself.

309
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,607
Uncle.

310
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:18,684
Help.

311
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:04,714
How about the other client?

312
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,014
The old man.

313
01:07:10,816 --> 01:07:18,340
He fell out of a window
from the second floor.

314
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:30,214
"...fell from second floor..."

315
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,774
Take care of him.

316
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:59,063
Didn't you hear the doorbell?
Why are you messing up the flat?

317
01:10:00,407 --> 01:10:02,372
Make sure you clean it up...

318
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:05,398
...when you move out.

319
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,865
Here's your contract.

320
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:10,763
What is this?

321
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:15,099
Here's another one.

322
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:47,756
Are you alright?

323
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,429
I'm sorry.

324
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:21,855
Fai.

325
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:23,990
How did I fall out of the window?

326
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:28,320
The doctor said it was
because I took too many pills.

327
01:13:29,428 --> 01:13:30,723
I don't remember anything.

328
01:13:30,928 --> 01:13:32,916
Someone pushed you over.

329
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:37,515
Who did it? Why?

330
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,652
I'm busy. I'll call you later.

331
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,025
Last month a deadly accident took place...

332
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,991
...at North Point.

333
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,352
The bus driver finally woke up...

334
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:50,223
...from coma last night.

335
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,913
and gave his statement.

336
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:18,048
Fai.

337
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:19,984
I killed Fatty.

338
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:31,053
Honey.

339
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:32,882
Uncle, what did you say?

340
01:14:33,057 --> 01:14:34,386
I dropped the balls.

341
01:14:35,724 --> 01:14:36,950
They hit the bus.

342
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,487
That's how Fatty died.

343
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:40,947
It was an accident.

344
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:43,418
It can't be. No.

345
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:47,845
It can't be!

346
01:16:11,785 --> 01:16:13,546
Dad!

347
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,507
Look!

348
01:16:26,285 --> 01:16:27,477
Why did you lie?

349
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:29,343
How can I ever trust you again?

350
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:30,948
How did I fall out of the window?

351
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,340
The doctors said it was
because I took too many pills.

352
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,345
You took them already.

353
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:43,476
I knew you'd betray me.

354
01:16:43,716 --> 01:16:46,045
You're making everything up.

355
01:16:50,383 --> 01:16:53,314
It was an accident. 2 dead and 8 injured.

356
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:55,178
I killed Fatty.

357
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,745
I dropped the balls.

358
01:16:58,283 --> 01:16:59,942
They hit the bus.

359
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:04,081
It was an accident.

360
01:17:06,749 --> 01:17:08,112
I was wrong.

361
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:10,811
You're crazy!

362
01:17:14,948 --> 01:17:16,345
"Renovation Notice"

363
01:17:16,614 --> 01:17:17,601
I'm sorry.

364
01:17:17,948 --> 01:17:23,005
Dad, the workmen's quotation
doesn't seem right.

365
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:31,911
What did you say?

366
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:43,501
Daughter!

367
01:20:32,403 --> 01:20:34,459
Why did you do this to us?

368
01:20:37,769 --> 01:20:40,166
Why did you do this to us?
