我想你還沒搞明白是怎麼一回事
l don't think you know how it works.

When l was young, l tried to be an actor. l was awful.

103
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:54,568

你們在幹嗎？

這只是個遊戲，Bethlehem將軍
lt's just a game, General Bethlehem.

是他們在戲裡看到的一些東西 沒什麼傷害的
lt's something they saw in a play. No harm in it.

真遺憾，我錯過了一齣好戲

00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:07,035
我們幾乎沒有準備好我們想玩的遊戲
We haven't nearly stocked the game that we thought we would.

127
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,405
是嗎？ 但你們卻有時間演戲？
Really? But you had time for a play?

我不是他們一起的 我只是路過此地

...軟弱的哀號溶化了

165
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,270

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,834
在獲得這個機會之前你是幹什麼的？
What did you do before you were given this opportunity?

172
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:41,735

就是你
Yes, you.

179
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,027
我只是個演員
l'm just a performer.

180
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,098
比如莎士比亞的戲劇

181
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:18,772
莎士比亞？

我知道莎士比亞是誰
l know who Shakespeare was.

185
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,179
高喊著Havoc!...
''Cry 'Havoc!' ...

186
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,819
...讓戰爭帶來的傷害...
...and let slip...

187
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,682
...成為過去！
...the dogs of war.''

188
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,002
我？
Me?

189
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,733
「做還是不做
''To be or not to be:

190
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:53,567
著是個問題」
That is the question.''

191
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,782
「我們很少...

194
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,347
「現在通過約克之光，我們要...

195
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,245
...把不滿的冬天變成燦爛的夏天」
...by this sun of York.''

196
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:41,548
你相當不錯
You're pretty good.

197
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,359
你也是個鬥士 我可以從你的眼神裡看出來
You're also a fighter. l can see it in your eyes.

198
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,662
你是個危險人物
You are a dangerous man.

199
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,430
你不同意？
Don't you agree?

200
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:02,305
長官，我不是不尊敬你 不過你最好還是把我放了
No disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off letting me go.

201
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,885
把我逼上絕路我就是個鬥士
A fighter is about the last thing that l am.

202
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,924
難道你不認為這由我來決定嗎？
Don't you think l should be the judge of that, soldier?

203
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,891
起來
Get up.

204
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,330
我說起來
l said, get up!

205
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,281
你說的沒錯 你不是個鬥士
You're right. You're not a fighter.

206
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,945
但你將會成為一個鬥士
But you will be.

207
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:48,986
我給你個機會...

223
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,257

224

00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,962
每個幫派內的兄弟都可以挑戰老大的地位
Any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan.

287
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,460
有沒有人想向我挑戰？
Does anyone wish to challenge me?

288
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:14,733
起立
On your feet.

289
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,202
第八條：
Law Eight:

290
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:25,245
只有一項懲罰，死！
There's only one penalty. Death.

291
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,006
求你了，求求你了
Please! l'm begging you!

292
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,801
在這裡，有付出就會有回報
You will get out of this army what you put into it.

293
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,665
你工作你就會有得吃
Work and you'll be fed.

294
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,373
你戰鬥你就會被人所尊敬
Fight and you'll be respected.

295
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,278
你戰死你就會被人所懷念
Die and you'll be remembered.

296
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,961
你想著要挑戰我的老大地位？
You thinking of challenging for leadership?

297
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,786
我沒有，長官
No, sir.

298
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,625
我只是個跟隨者...
l'm a follower...

299
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,433
...而不是領導者
...not a leader.

300
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,159
你倒是挺伶牙俐齒的...
You got a smart mouth...

301
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,564
...莎士比亞
...Shakespeare.

302
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,964
你知不知道Getty上校一直追隨著將軍？
You see Colonel Getty always following the General?

303
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,100
但他最後卻向將軍挑戰
He was the last man ever to challenge.

304
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,972
戰鬥持續了6秒...
Fight lasted 6 seconds...

305
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:33,382
...但將軍沒有殺他
...but he didn't kill him.

306
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,475
只是割下他的舌頭...
Cut off his tongue...

307
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:38,051
...再割下他的軟蛋
...then he cut off his balls.

308
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:42,952
而老Getty從此就像只忠誠的狗一樣追隨著將軍
And old Getty's been following him around like a dog ever since.

309
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:45,318
解散
Fall out!

310
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,397
將軍沒注意...
The General don't see it...

311
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,998
...但是我說你有反骨
...but l say you've got some nigger in you.

312
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,753
這些都是你的？
They're yours?

313
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,532
真是個獨行俠阿？
A solitary man, aren't you?

314
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,995
用望遠鏡可以從遠處觀察生活，而Shakespeare...
Binoculars to watch life from a distance and Shakespeare...

315
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,502
...卻是讀生活而不過日子
...to read about it, instead of living it.

316
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:34,340
我無意冒犯你 但是你自己好像已經讀過莎士比亞的...
No offense, but you seem to have read Shakespeare...

317
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,636
...作品
...yourself.

318
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:41,248
如果他想要上檔次 而不是僅僅幹些暗殺之類的...
lf he wishes to rise above mere thuggery...

319
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,648
...一個軍事指揮官必須受過正規傳統的教育...
...a military commander must be classically educated...

320
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:48,119
...哲學、歷史甚至戲劇敏感性
...philosophy and history, even a sense of the dramatic.

321
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:54,354
你以為我在戰前是幹什麼工作的？
What do you think that l did before the war?

322
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:57,028
你以為我是個軍人？
Do you think that l was in the army?

323
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,898
我賣複印機的
l sold copying machines.

324
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:01,668
我是個銷售員...
l was a salesman...

325
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,630
...卻有著領導天賦 設計並秘密的執行...
...with the talent to lead men, devise and execute a battle plan...

326
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,435
...軍事計劃
...locked away inside.

327
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:12,911
要不是Nathan Holn的話 我現在還在賣複印機
lf Nathan Holn hadn't come along, l'd still be selling copying machines.

328
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,409
你能想像...
Can you imagine...

329
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:19,145
...被浪費的生命 你能想像浪費有多嚴重嗎？
...the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of that?

330
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:21,484
但是戰爭...
But war...

331
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,692
...給了像我這樣的人一個機會
...war gives men like me a chance.

332
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,287
Here.

333
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:34,933
「獎盃總是名花無主的
''The prize is often left unclaimed.

334
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,867
我們必須鼓起勇氣來...
We must have the courage to grasp it...

335
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,737
...因為未來總是偏愛膽大的人」
...for fortune always favors the bold.''

336
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:55,254
他總是激勵著我
He always inspires me.

337
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,892
我對未來已經有了設計，一個總體規劃
l have a design for the future. A master plan.

338
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,963
我需要個能幹的軍官來幫我實現
l will need able officers to help me carry it out.

339
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,129
你有這個才能
You have the intelligence.

340
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,098
如果你忠心...
lf your heart matches...

341
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,866
...你可以走得很遠
...you will go far.

342
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,601
我們接下來幾周再詳談
We'll talk more in weeks to come.

343
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,276
解散
Dismissed.

344
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,606
隊長
Captain!

345
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,982
我們明天出發
We'll be moving out tomorrow.

346
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:22,981
利用望遠鏡作偵查
lssue those binoculars to a scout.

347
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,786
書呢，長官？
And the book, sir?

348
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:27,246
燒了它
Burn it.

349
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,597
出去
Quit moving!

350
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,332
怎麼樣？
What happened?

351
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:46,638
-怎麼樣，他怎麼說？ -沒什麼
-What happened? What'd he say? -Nothing.

352
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,977
他有沒有提到我?
Did he say anything about me?

353
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,304
沒有
No!

354
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:58,715
-我要離開這裡 -你在胡說什麼？
-l'm getting out of here. -What are you talking about?

355
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,519
-逃跑！ -什麼？！
-Escaping. -What?!

356
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:05,421
你有沒有聽過Saint Rose？ 在海岸邊
You ever hear of Saint Rose? lt's on the coast.

357
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,959
-那是天堂 -我們做不到
-lt's a paradise. -We can't.

358
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:08,221
我們可以！
We could!

359
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,558
我們三人就能做到
Between the 3 of us we could.

360
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,668
我不行
l can't.

361
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:19,768
我喜歡這 我喜歡成為一份子的感覺
l like it here. l like being a part of something.

362
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,367
前去看看
Take a point!

363
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,249
有人射了一隻獅子
Some of the men shot a lion.

364
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,052
他們爬進來灌木叢
They crawled into the thicket.

365
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:24,170
你們這些狗崽子賺了一頓阿
One of you dogs earned a treat.

366
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:26,906
就在那邊
Over there.

367
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,174
那些人今天早上獵殺了一隻獅子
Those men hunted a lion this morning.

368
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,141
在戰前這裡肯定是個該死的動物園
Must've been a goddamn zoo here before the war.

369
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,478
不管怎樣第三個人得跟著過去
Anyway, a third man went in after it.

370
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,584
我們不知道他是死還是活
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

371
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:42,857
我需要個志願者
l want a volunteer.

372
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,186
你們中的一個要跟過去
One of you is going in there after him.

373
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,492
我去
l'll go.

374
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,737
我猜個子大的不一定膽大阿
l guess size ain't a measure of courage.

375
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,304
不是嗎？
ls it?

376
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,068
我不這麼想，隊長
l don't think so, Captain!

377
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:37,111
活著回來，你就可以吃烤獅子了
Come out alive, you get a lion steak!

378
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:47,080
也許在那你能找到你的Saint Rose
Maybe you'll find your Saint Rose over there.

379
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:55,553
你還在磨蹭什麼呢，等著聖誕節嗎？
What the hell are you waiting for, Christmas?

380
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,949
為什麼停下來
Why are you stopping?

381
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:55,885
我找到他了
l found him.

快走
Hurry up!

385
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,196
你還有隻獅子要背呢
You still got a lion to bag!

386
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,820
你們都給我退後
You men get back in line!

387
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,221
-他在那 -快開槍射擊
-There he is! -Shoot him!

388
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,072
跳進水裡 如果找不到他

389
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,646
...你和另外一個人就會替他去死
...and you and another man will die in his place.

390
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,144
快走快走
Go! Go!

391
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,921

Go!

393
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,622

394
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:21,254
讓我走吧
Just let me go.

395
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,055
我不想加入你們的軍隊
l don't want to be a part of your army.

396
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,058
我的軍隊？
My army?

397
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,197
我喜歡你這麼說
l like the sound of that.

398
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,934
我逮著他了
l got him!

399
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,636
對不起
l'm sorry.

400
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:47,817
你怎麼...
How come...

401
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:50,253
...會這樣...
...you wrecked it...

402
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,317
...對我呢？
...for me?

403
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,471
不是你死就是我活
lt's me or you.

404
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:07,770
什麼？
What?

405
00:42:10,346 --> 00:42:11,973
可以不這樣的
lt doesn't have to be.

406
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:16,112
我們可以一起走
We can go together. You and me.

407
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,221
好小子！
Good boy!

408
00:42:23,492 --> 00:42:24,823
好小子！
Good boy.

409
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:28,555
抓住他
Get him.

410
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:33,530
夠了
Finish it!

411
00:42:43,512 --> 00:42:44,536
抓住他
Get him.

412
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:46,904
這就對了
That's it.

413
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:55,021
該死的，抓住他
Get him, damn it!

414
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,962
「戰士戰死沙場」
''No harness on my back.''

415
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:44,565
你在流血?
Bleeding?

416
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:46,104
嗯，容易流血的傢伙...
Well, bleeder...

How you doing?

420
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,110
這可沒你的份
You shouldn't have.

421
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:45,805

01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:42,789
也沒有得過梅毒之類的病？
No syphilis, nothing like that?

571
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:48,495
據你所知...
So as far as you know...

572
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:51,232
...你精子質量不錯？
...you have good semen?

573
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,328
你在開玩笑？
ls that a trick question?

574
01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:59,433
不，我沒有
No, it's not.

575
01:01:02,677 --> 01:01:03,701
我只是問你...
l'm only asking...

576
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:06,873
...因為我想讓你使我懷孕
...because l want you to make me pregnant.

577
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,509
好吧...
All right...

578
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:12,212
...這就對了
...that's it.

579
01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:13,946
等等
Wait.

580
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:15,553
請等一等
Wait, please.

581
01:01:18,393 --> 01:01:20,588
好像是個穿制服的
lt's got to be the uniform.

582
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:24,555
這是我丈夫，Michael 他沒有反對
This is my husband, Michael. He hasn't said no.

583
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,928
我什麼也沒說
l haven't said anything yet.

584
01:01:28,169 --> 01:01:30,899
我們連續三年一直都打算要個孩子
We've been trying to have a baby for 3 years.

585
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,506
我們不能指望他 他一歲時就已經的了腮腺炎
We cannot on account of Michael. He had the bad mumps when he was 1 .

586
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:37,708
所以我們需要一個捐精者
So we need a body father.

587
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,708
我們本可以在這裡找一個 但這樣會帶來很多問題
We could ask a man here, but it may cause problems.

588
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,474
我們見到過這樣的事
We've seen it happen.

589
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:48,417
在女人沒表現出來以前都沒問題 但之後就很麻煩了
Things go okay until the woman shows, then it can be difficult.

590
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,784
但是你只是路過這裡發發信件
But you'll only be around once in a while with the mail.

591
01:01:54,729 --> 01:01:56,492
你是個郵差
You're the postman.

592
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,621
你覺得怎麼樣？
What do you say, mister?

593
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,093
你得幫我們一個忙
You'd do us a favor.

594
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:06,865
我會考慮考慮
l'm going to think about it.

595
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:17,049
請原諒
Excuse me.

596
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:21,979
我媽媽想給你些東西
My mother would like to give you something.

597
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,357
媽媽，他就在這裡
He's right here, Mom.

598
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:30,062
這是給我另外一個女兒的...
lt's to my other daughter...

599
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:31,561
...她叫安妮
...Annie.

600
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,168
信上沒說她在哪
lt doesn't say where.

601
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:48,204
她五年前離開了這 我們不知道她在哪裡
We don't know where she is. She left 5 years ago.

602
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,680
我們聽說她住在北部
The last we heard she was living up north.

603
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:55,215
我說，March夫人 你應該知道--
Look, Mrs. March, you should know that--

604
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,654
知道什麼？
lKnow what?

605
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,999
我對你有種直覺
l have a feeling about you.

606
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:10,203
我知道你會答應我的
l know you'll do what's right.

607
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:30,517
我得趕緊離開這鬼地方
l got to get out of here.

608
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:46,967
放鬆，寶貝
Easy, boy.

609
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,836
就在那個角落
lt's right around the corner.

610
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:54,876
什麼東西？
What is?

611
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,709
你正在找的東西
What you're looking for.

612
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:09,797
我在找什麼？
What l'm looking for?

613
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:15,730
瘋狂的老白癡
Crazy old coot.

614
01:04:58,045 --> 01:04:59,603
我就知道你會來的
l knew you'd come here.

615
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,380
是嗎？
You did?

616
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,617
你是如何成為一個郵差的？
So how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?

617
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:15,693
在正確的時候你得出現在正確的地點
You have to be in the right place at the right time.

618
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,658
我怎麼才能做到呢？
How can l do it?

619
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,399
-我還以為你想要開車呢 -不再想了，那時小孩子的玩意
-l thought you wanted to drive cars. -Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.

620
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:25,970
這是現實
This is real.

621
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,302
那正確的地點又在哪裡？
So where's the right place?

622
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:33,544
你知道，可能在任何時間的任何地點
Could be anywhere, you know. Anytime.

623
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:37,643
只有另外一個郵差才能讓你成為一個郵差
Only another postman can make you a postman.

624
01:05:37,952 --> 01:05:39,943
就像吸血鬼那樣？
lKind of like vampires, right?

625
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,451
對，有點像那樣
Yeah, something like that.

626
01:05:46,494 --> 01:05:47,984
你必須得發誓
You have to be sworn in, so....

627
01:05:54,268 --> 01:05:58,034
郵局有些不太穩定，也許持續不了多久
The organization's kind of shaky right now. lt might not last.

628
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,570
怎麼發誓？
What does?

629
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:04,177
你將會碰到一些根本不信任你的人
You'd meet people who don't believe in you.

630
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,107
我會和他們坦誠相待
l'll set them straight.

631
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:09,643
郵差是個孤獨的工作
lt's a lonely job.

632
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:13,046
我這一生都孤獨
l've been lonely all my life.

633
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:16,513
我也一樣，Ford
So have l, Ford.

634
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:18,858
我也一樣啊
So have l.

635
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:21,887
真該死！
What the hell!

636
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:24,196
你跟著我念
You repeat after me.

637
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:29,826
「無論大雪還是...
''Neither snow...

638
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,333
還是暴雨...
...nor rain...

639
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:32,936
無論是炎炎烈日...
...nor heat...

640
01:06:33,474 --> 01:06:34,634
還是漆黑夜晚...
...nor gloom of night...

641
01:06:39,614 --> 01:06:41,309
郵差...
...stays these couriers...

642
01:06:42,149 --> 01:06:45,880
都會迅速的完成他們的任務」
...from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.''

643
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:48,581
好了，可以了
Okay, then.

644
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:49,448
好了，可以了
Okay, then.

645
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:54,027
不，我說可以了 你聽就行了
No, l'm saying that. You just listen.

646
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:55,456
對不起
l'm sorry.

647
01:06:57,465 --> 01:07:00,593
經過我的授權，現在你可以投遞這些信件了
By my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail.

648
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:03,033
恭喜你
Congratulations.

649
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,103
你是個郵差了
You're a postman.

650
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,147
為了送信我會萬死不辭
l'd die to get a letter through.

651
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,414
你說什麼？
What did you say?

652
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:21,513
-我說，為了送信我會萬死不辭 -Johnny!
-l said l'd die to get a letter through. -Johnny!

653
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:23,655
你怎麼還不走開
Why don't you run along.

654
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,550
我要和他說幾句話
l need to speak to this man.

655
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:29,654
我待會再找你
l'll see you around.

656
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:32,261
就這麼說定了，Ford
Sure thing, Ford.

657
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:39,029
Johnny對你印象很好 整個鎮子的人對你印象都很好
Johnny is impressed with you. Whole town is impressed with you.

658
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,969
我猜不包括你吧
l take it you're not.

659
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,576
-你比你看起來的要聰明的多 -有什麼可以效勞的？
-You're smarter than you look. -What can l do for you?

660
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:49,273
要麼你自己自動消失要麼我把你趕走 兩條路隨你挑
You can either clear out or l can throw you out. Either way suits me.

661
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:53,416
你還沒搞明白 我是由政府授權的--
You don't understand. l'm a government employee authorized by--

662
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:56,215
你被授權個屁！
You are not authorized by shit!

663
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,152
你只是逃難到了這裡 你只不過是個...
You were trying to sneak out of here. You are nothing...

664
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,626
發現了一袋信件的流浪漢 我要你滾出我的鎮子
...but a drifter who found a bag of mail. l want you out of town.

665
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:07,862
好吧，我會把這都寫進我的報告
All right. This is going in my report.

666
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:11,137
郵差先生，這裡的人們不需要夢想
These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman.

667
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,069
他們需要一些實際的東西 他們需要Holnists的幫助
They need something real. They need help with the Holnists.

668
01:08:15,276 --> 01:08:17,267
你能帶給他們這些嗎？
Are you going to bring them that?

669
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:20,980
我想不能吧
Didn't think so.

670
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,916
到目前為止你帶給我們的只是 幾碗湯還有幾顆破碎的心
All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.

671
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:29,146
我要這個地方保持原樣
l aim to keep it that way.

672
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:31,692
你可以在這待到明天早上...
You can stay here till morning...

673
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,827
以後我就再也不想看見你了
...then l don't ever want to see you again.

674
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,247
Benning
''Benning.

Boston？

677
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,628
這些傢伙--
What the hell these people--

678
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,524
走開
Just leave it.

679
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:16,603
我叫你走開
l said, leave it.

680
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:24,711
Saint Rose？
''Saint Rose''?

681
01:09:50,237 --> 01:09:51,101
你好，Abby
Hello, Abby.

682
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:55,665
你明天就要走了？
You'll be leaving tomorrow?

683
01:09:57,878 --> 01:09:59,106
是吧
l guess.

684
01:10:04,351 --> 01:10:07,684
每個人都在熬夜寫信 等著你幫他們帶走
Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take.

685
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:10,618
他們都很興奮
They're so excited.

686
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:14,426
那你呢？你寫信了沒有？
And how about you? Do you have a letter?

687
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,129
我不知道要寫給誰
l don't have anybody to write to.

688
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,528
我可以給你找個筆友
l'll find you a pen pal.

689
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:24,767
就是有著相同愛好的一些人
Someone with similar interests. You know?

690
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,701
比如說跳舞了，還有...
Like dancing and...

691
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,304
檢查腮腺炎
...checking for mumps.

692
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:31,307
你很風趣
You're funny.

693
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,677
鎮上的人幾乎都不懂風趣了
Hardly anybody's funny around here.

694
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:43,680
你已經決定了沒有？
Have you decided yet?

695
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:57,966
我一直都在考慮
Been thinking about it.

696
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:22,292
當然了
Sure.

697
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:24,186
我是說...
l mean...

698
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:26,931
為什麼不呢？
...why not?

699
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:36,008
天啊，你真是太....
God, you're so....

700
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:38,137
你太...
You're so...

701
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,341
漂亮了
...beautiful.

702
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,451
對不起，也許你希望這更像是個醫療手術
l'm sorry, you probably want to keep things more clinical.

703
01:11:47,788 --> 01:11:50,018
你甚至不知道我的名字
You don't even know my name.

704
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,690
我不想知道
l don't want to.

705
01:12:00,334 --> 01:12:01,926
如果你把眼睛閉上的話...
lt would be easier for me...

706
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:04,263
我會覺得更自然
...if you closed your eyes.

707
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,079
郵差先生，我們經過討論
We took a vote, Mr. Postman.

708
01:14:32,686 --> 01:14:34,085
希望你能收下
We want you to have this.

709
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:42,793
所以你不能拒絕
So you can't say no.

710
01:14:48,802 --> 01:14:50,326
我收下了
l'll take it.

711
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,938
一捲鋪蓋、一些麥片還有一周的乾糧
You got a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.

712
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,402

你要往哪裡走？
Where will you go from here?

715
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:03,207
哪裡？
Go?

716
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:10,287
西方...
West...

717
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,618
然後我又會再返回來
...then l'll work my way...

718
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:17,160
就像走個"8"字形
...back here, sort of a figure eight.

719
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:26,430
現在的情況是困難了點
Times seem hard right now.

720
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,004
但是你們要堅信會越來越好的
But you got to believe things are getting better.

721
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:34,046
鳥兒又開始遷徙了
Birds are migrating again.

722
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:35,838
雨季來臨了
The rains are back.

723
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:38,676
局勢...
Stuff's....

724
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:40,680
局勢正在逐漸好轉
Stuff's getting better.

725
01:15:43,223 --> 01:15:44,884
Oh beautiful

726
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:50,790
For spacious skies

727
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:54,126
For amber waves of grain

728
01:15:58,639 --> 01:15:59,970
該死
Shit!

729
01:16:00,874 --> 01:16:02,637
無論你是誰 你還是顯得有些緊張
You've got a hell of a nerve, whoever you are.

730
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:12,178
今天早上你看見Abby了嗎？
Did you see Abby around this morning?

731
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,516
我就送你到這裡了
This is as far as l go.

732
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:18,318
你自己上路吧
You're on your own.

733
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:21,426
God shed his grace on thee

734
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:27,524
And crown thy good

735
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:29,861
With brotherhood

736
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,001
你真的像你說的是個郵差嗎？
Are you really who you say you are?

737
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:36,008
如果我帶著信件回來...
lf l come back with some mail...

738
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,777
你就會相信了
...you'll know.

739
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,050
該死
Goddamn it!

740
01:17:16,516 --> 01:17:18,575
你看什麼？
What are you looking at?

741
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:21,277
全身
Everything.

742
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:24,017
他們通常不看我的
They don't usually look at me.

743
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,761
那個...
Who is responsible...

744
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:44,500
...是誰幹的？
...for that?

745
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:50,340
我說...
l said...

746
01:18:50,544 --> 01:18:53,012

誰幹的？
...for that''?!

748
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:02,778
Holnists,Johnny 你得呆在--
Holnists, Johnny. You got to stay--

749
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:07,886

-You got to stay out of sight. -l'm a postman!

750
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:10,086
我不會當逃兵的！
And l'm not running from anybody!

751
01:19:10,297 --> 01:19:13,289
呆在這裡 不然我會親自把你鎖起來！
Stay out of this, or l will lock you up myself.

752
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:25,503
你得負責
You'll be responsible.

753
01:19:34,388 --> 01:19:36,686
去把旗子燒了
Now set that flag on fire.

754
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:06,277
從窗戶扔進郵局
Throw it through the window of your post office.

755
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:09,050
快照辦，Michael

756
01:20:09,256 --> 01:20:11,417
沒事的，Michael，快照辦
lt's all right, Michael. Throw it.

757
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,291
美利堅合眾國...

758
01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:20,523
...並不存在！
...doesn't exist!

759
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,568
那面國旗就是垃圾
That flag is an abomination!

760
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:52,331
有一個最奇怪的小山羊 它躲在柵欄後面....
There was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it....

761
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,036
我看著它而它臉色就變了
l looked at it and it had a color to it.

762
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:12,478
不錯
Good.

763
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:14,081
都不錯
Everything.

764
01:21:16,089 --> 01:21:18,557
我很吃驚 難道它是....

是第一流的美臀
...is a first-rate piece of ass.

去叫鎮長給我引見一下 她這種美人不屬於這種小地方的
Tell the sheriff to introduce me. She doesn't belong in this mudhole.

769
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:35,935
請原諒
Excuse me.

770
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:38,738

她已經結婚了

773
01:21:43,783 --> 01:21:44,943
是嗎？
Really?

774
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:50,585
你知道我們在這裡執行的是什麼政府體制嗎？
Do you know what system of government we have here?

775
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:56,451
我們執行的是所謂的聯邦體系 就像中世紀那樣
We have what is known as a feudal system, like in the Middle Ages.

776
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:59,530
君主和臣子 就像你和我
That's lords and vassals. That's you and me.

777
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,999
現在那些君主
Now those lords...

778
01:22:02,202 --> 01:22:03,692
他們有些想法
...they had some ideas.

779
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,998
他們認為如果一個臣子結婚了
They believed that if a vassal got married...

780
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:09,300
那君主就有權...
...it was the lord's right...

781
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:10,703
有權...
...his right...

782
01:22:11,378 --> 01:22:14,040
享有和臣子的新娘過夜的「初夜權」
...to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.

783
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,178
我和Abby已經結婚三年了
Me and Abby have been married 3 years.

784
01:22:23,456 --> 01:22:26,220
真遺憾我沒有被邀請參加你們的婚禮
l'm sorry, but l wasn't invited to the wedding.

785
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,062
你已經幫我一個忙了
You've already done me one favor, son.

786
01:22:35,936 --> 01:22:38,666
不要讓這件事成為你的一個污點
Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.

787
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,372
我們都是斯文人
We'll be civilized about this.

788
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:53,643
我希望你能祝福我
l want you to give me your blessing.

789
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:03,485
先生，我做不到
Sir, l can't.

790
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,092
你做不到？
You can't?

791
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:09,457
你做不到
You can't.

792
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,938
做不到
''Can't.''

793
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,573
我們曾有個偉大的國家
We had a great nation once.

794
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:23,710
我知道它為什麼能偉大
lKnow what made it great?

795
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:26,883
因為「我做得到」
''l can.''

796
01:23:27,988 --> 01:23:29,250
直到弱智們來了
Till the weak came along.

797
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,020
「我做不到」破壞了我們
The ''l can'ts'' destroyed us!

798
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:36,995
我現在就要讓我們重新強大起來
l'm going to make us strong again.

799
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:39,355
我要成為一個新國家的...
l'm going to be the father...

800
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:41,166
...國父
...of a new nation.

801
01:23:42,168 --> 01:23:43,658
你知不知道為什麼...
And do you know why...

802
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,428
...會是我呢？
...it will be me?

803
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,706
因為「我做得到」
Because l can.

804
01:24:01,588 --> 01:24:02,850
快住手
Stop it!

805

求你了讓我過去吧

幫幫他啊，誰能幫幫他啊
Help him, somebody! Please!

809
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:33,850
你大可不必--
You didn't have to--!

810
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:36,312
不必什麼？
Didn't have to what?

811
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:40,858
你個混蛋！
You bastard!

812
01:24:42,696 --> 01:24:44,129
是你殺了他
You killed him!

813
01:24:44,898 --> 01:24:47,059
你的人好像很不安分阿
Your people seem seditious.

814
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,526
你好像也不安分
You seem seditious.

815

美國政府！
The United States government!

821

01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:40,948
他往哪個方向走了？
Which way did he go?

They say they got a representative of the Restored United States in there.

853
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:31,289
他們說我們的軍隊是非法的
They say this army is illegal.

854
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,753
-他們還說-- -快去死吧!
-And they say-- -Drop dead!

855
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,053
下地獄吧！
And go to hell!

856
01:28:38,364 --> 01:28:39,661
他們就這麼說的
That's what they say.

857
01:28:39,866 --> 01:28:41,891
你們在幹嗎？ 快開城門
What are you doing?! Open the gates.

858
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:47,565
ldiots!
ldiots!

859
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,370
你都在想些什麼？！
What're you thinking?!

860
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,478
《羅馬書》上...
The Romans...

861
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:57,412
有句話...
...had an expression...

862
01:28:57,617 --> 01:29:00,450
常被用來嚇唬小孩子
...they used to scare their children.

863
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,252
「Hannibal...
''Hannibal...

864
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:06,016
...ad portas」
...ad portas!''

865
01:29:07,393 --> 01:29:08,758
Hannibal...
Hannibal...

866
01:29:09,629 --> 01:29:11,654
...就在門口
...is at the gates.

867
01:29:18,805 --> 01:29:20,670
你知道Hannibal是誰嗎?
Do you know who Hannibal was?

868
01:29:22,675 --> 01:29:23,835
當然不知道
Of course not.

869
01:29:24,043 --> 01:29:26,944
像你這麼漂亮的女孩當然不會明白這種事情了
A pretty girl like you wouldn't understand something like that.

870
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:34,045
-讓我們和他們打吧！ -用什麼打？
-Let's fight them! -With what?

871
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:37,518
我們有五把槍 卻一發子彈也沒有
We've got 5 guns, maybe 0 rounds of ammo.

872
01:29:37,724 --> 01:29:39,487
就這些武器我們怎麼和他們打？
How we going to fight with that?

873
01:29:39,692 --> 01:29:40,852
你們不要打
You don't.

874
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:46,229
和他們談判吧
Negotiate a settlement.

875
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,196
給他們些額外的補給
Give them extra supplies.

876
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:56,466
告訴他們，你是政府的代表
You're the government rep. Tell them.

877
01:30:11,424 --> 01:30:12,516
就在這裡
Right here.

878
01:30:23,302 --> 01:30:26,066
快點 我還有個攻擊計劃要制定
Make it quick. l've got an attack to coordinate.

879
01:30:27,206 --> 01:30:29,538
他們叫我來訂個和平條約
They've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty.

880
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:34,243
我認識你嗎？
Do l know you?

881
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,334
我不這樣認為，先生
l don't think so, sir.

882
01:30:38,112 --> 01:30:39,704
你就是郵差
You're the postman.

883
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:41,112
是嗎?
Aren't you?

884
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:45,743
進去!
lnside!

885
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:51,919
美國的信
''U.S. Mail.''

886
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,961
重建後的美國
''The Restored United States of America.''

887
01:30:56,597 --> 01:30:59,532
這裡的人真的相信這些狗屎?!
Do these people really believe that shit?!

888
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,994
說真的，你到底是誰?
Who are you, really?

889
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,698
我是一個美國的郵差...
l'm a United States postman...

890
01:31:06,073 --> 01:31:09,634
...通過重建的國會第417號命令授權
...authorized by Order 4 1 7 of the Restored Congress.

891
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:13,974
我參加了Georgetown戰役 我親眼目睹白宮被夷為平地
l was at the Battle of Georgetown. l watched the White House burn down.

892
01:31:14,181 --> 01:31:16,206
你別想讓我...
Do not try to sell me...

893
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,783
...相信那所謂的重建的美國!
...on any Restored United States!

894
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:24,285
新的首都建在Minneapolis...

...在Hubert Humphrey的地下宮殿裡面
...inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome.

896
01:31:27,795 --> 01:31:30,320
你知道過去的維京人在什麼地方玩耍嗎?
You know where the Vikings used to play?

897
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,865
你在開玩笑吧
You're funny.

898
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,135
條件是什麼?
What are the terms?

899
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:44,939
他們將打開大門, 給與平常雙倍的物資...
They'll open the gates, give double the usual...

900
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:46,309
...只是...
...just...

901
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,845
...不要傷害任何人
...don't hurt anybody.

902
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:49,776
這一切只是一個誤會
This was all a misunderstanding.

903
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,818
我讚賞你的提議,郵差先生
l appreciate your offer, Mr. Postman.

904
01:32:00,027 --> 01:32:03,656
但事實是你根本沒有資格來討價還價
But the fact is that you're in no position to negotiate.

905
01:32:04,165 --> 01:32:07,657
這裡的人造成了瘋狂和暴亂...
These people made it through the bugs and the riots...

906
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:11,735
...還有長達三年的冬天, 但是他們並不想讓你倖存
...and the 3-year winters, but they're not going to survive you.

907
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,038
給我開火!
Fire at will!

908
01:32:24,618 --> 01:32:25,983
法律第六條:
Law Six:

909
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:28,280
法律就是...
Justice can be...

910
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:29,717
...命令!
...dictated!

911
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:36,656
殺了他, 把重建的美國和他一起殺了
lKill him, and kill the Restored United States with him.

912
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,748
根據法律第8條...

913
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:03,549
...以及緊急事件授權第46號命令...

914
01:33:03,757 --> 01:33:05,247

915
01:33:12,633 --> 01:33:13,531
抓住她!
Get her!

916
01:34:07,788 --> 01:34:09,449
快去, 抓住他!
Go on, get him!

917
01:34:30,711 --> 01:34:32,736
我們現在不能停
We can't stop now.

918
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:36,510
你怎麼了?
What are you...?

919
01:34:39,553 --> 01:34:40,815
噢，上帝呀!
Oh, God!

920
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,354
趴下
Come on down.

921
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:26,906
別動
Don't move.

922
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:35,850
如果你有子彈,你早開槍了
lf you had a bullet, you'd use it.

923
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,757
快走
Come on.

924
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:48,048
我想我很久沒喝過湯了
l don't think l ever had water soup before.

925
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:52,255
也許下次我們應該試著放點鹽
Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand.

926
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,022
泥土
Dirt.

927
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,494
也許只是一點佐料
Maybe a twig garnish.

928
01:38:04,537 --> 01:38:06,528
你總是認為我很好笑
You used to think l was funny.

929
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:12,204
他們殺了Michael
They killed Michael.

930
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:22,688
我很難過
l'm sorry.

931
01:38:26,993 --> 01:38:28,255
你難過什麼?
How sorry are you?

932
01:38:29,729 --> 01:38:30,753
什麼?
What?

933
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:37,894
你這樣問什麼意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

934
01:38:40,907 --> 01:38:41,703
你怎麼了?
What's with you?

935
01:38:41,908 --> 01:38:44,035
你身上有個8的印記
You have the mark of 8 on you.

936
01:38:45,912 --> 01:38:46,879
印記並不表示--
Mark doesn't mean--

937
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:48,740
你是個騙子
You're a liar.

938
01:38:51,818 --> 01:38:52,910
你和Bethlehem在一起
You were with Bethlehem.

939
01:38:53,953 --> 01:38:56,046
你也是他們的一分子?
Does that make you one of them?

940
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,127
別逼我用這個
Don't make me use this.

941
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:26,709
起風了
Wind's come up.

942
01:39:27,053 --> 01:39:28,315
越來越冷了
It's getting colder too.

943
01:39:29,222 --> 01:39:31,656
另一場暴風就要來了
Must be another storm.

944
01:39:35,328 --> 01:39:36,761
還要什麼?
Anything else?

945
01:39:38,464 --> 01:39:40,432
我不是說要你....
l didn't mean for you to....

946
01:39:40,633 --> 01:39:44,228
你再不下床走動你的腿就要爛掉
Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.

947
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,333
-我受傷了 -你懶惰!
-l'm hurt. -You're lazy!

948
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:47,699
懶惰?
Lazy?

949
01:39:47,974 --> 01:39:50,204
我的胃上穿了一個洞...
l got a hole in my stomach...

950
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:51,933
...而且我很虛弱
...and l'm weak.

951
01:39:52,144 --> 01:39:55,739
這周圍只有雪和草...
The  big meals around here are snow and grass...

952
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,007
...而且我們的草就要用完了
...and we're running out of grass.

953
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,357
你要幹什麼?
What're you doing?

954
01:40:36,622 --> 01:40:37,816
把早餐給我吧!
Give me a break!

955
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:41,656
我去檢查一下關口
l'm going to check the pass.

956
01:40:43,563 --> 01:40:45,190
你為什麼這麼著急?
Why are you in such a hurry?

957
01:40:45,398 --> 01:40:47,696
我們可以考慮一下更糟的地方
l could think of worse places.

958
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:50,896
或者更糟的軍隊
Or l could think of worse company.

959
01:40:58,277 --> 01:40:59,608
好極了!
Perfect!

960
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:58,829
救命!
Help!

961
01:42:06,512 --> 01:42:07,308
救命!
Help!

962
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,142
救命!
Please!

963
01:42:13,552 --> 01:42:14,519
快來呀!
Quick!

964
01:42:25,665 --> 01:42:27,257
上帝呀, 救救我!
God, help me!

965
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,110
我告訴你了我沒事
l told you that's all there was.

966
01:42:50,389 --> 01:42:52,448
正因為如此你該吃了它
That's why you should have it.

967
01:42:57,863 --> 01:42:59,694
我知道你能走
l knew you could walk.

968
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:03,362
你真奇怪
You're weird.

969
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,168
你知道嗎？?
lKnow that?

970
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,194
我曾經在月亮上走過, Abby
We walked on the moon once, Abby.

971
01:43:32,064 --> 01:43:33,497
真的?
So?

972
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,068
但現在有什麼好?
What good is that now?

973
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:41,338
顯然你忘記了...
Obviously you've forgotten...

974
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,905
...唐，和...
...Tang and...

975
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:45,201
...微波爐，還有....
...microwave ovens and....

976
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,242
你的臉看起來很可愛
Your face looks pretty.

977
01:43:58,157 --> 01:43:59,454
我的意思是...
l mean...

978
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:02,050
...如果沒受傷
...not so bruised.

979
01:44:09,235 --> 01:44:10,463
其實...
Look...

980
01:44:11,103 --> 01:44:12,593
...有些事你應該知道
...there's something you'd better know.

981
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,567
你很快就能發現
You're going to find out soon enough.

982
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,840
我懷孕了
l'm pregnant.

983
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,638
是Michael的孩子
lt's Michael's baby.

984
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:27,145
但其實你才是真正的父親
You're just the body father.

985
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:34,456
你怎麼知道是我的...
How do you know it's mine...

986
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:37,926
...不是Bethlehem的?
...not Bethlehem's?

987
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,230
他每天晚上都和我在一起
He tried with me almost every night.

988
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,569
但是他不行...
He couldn't do it...

989
01:44:54,446 --> 01:44:56,073
...所以他打我
...so he beat me.

990
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:02,312
還說是我的錯
Said it was my fault.

991
01:45:08,627 --> 01:45:09,594
對不起, Abby
l'm sorry, Abby.

992
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:50,666
怎麼了?
What is it?

993
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:53,227
出什麼事了?
What's wrong?

994
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,199
是孩子嗎?
ls it the baby?

995
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,968
那個關口空了
The pass is clear.

他們到底想分享他們所有的還是奪去你有的?
Do they want to share what they got or take what you have?

I'm almost home

1170

1282
02:13:48,546 --> 02:13:49,774
他們會殺了你的
They'll kill you!

1283
02:13:53,751 --> 02:13:54,809
攔住他
Hold him!

1284
02:13:58,088 --> 02:13:58,952
住手
Stop it!

1285
02:14:00,624 --> 02:14:01,716
-你們傷著他了 -沒有
-You're hurting him! -l'm not!

1286
02:14:01,926 --> 02:14:02,893
傷著了
Yes, you are!

1287
02:14:03,093 --> 02:14:05,425
沒有，我們沒傷害他
l'm not! l'm not hurting him.

1288
02:14:06,363 --> 02:14:10,265
這都是因為我 我沒有執行你的命令
This is all my doing. l went against your orders.

1289
02:14:11,068 --> 02:14:14,834
你叫我埋了那些死屍 但我把他們送到Bethlehem那裡了
You told me to bury the dead Holnists, but l sent them Bethlehem.

1290
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:16,063
為什麼？
Why?

1291
02:14:16,407 --> 02:14:17,704
我們得讓Bethlehem知道 我們永不放棄
Bethlehem has to know we won't stop!

1292
02:14:18,142 --> 02:14:19,905
真是該死
Goddamn it, Ford!

1293
02:14:21,378 --> 02:14:23,846
那些人是因我們而死啊
Those people are dying because of us!

1294
02:14:24,048 --> 02:14:26,346
他們因為我們所做的才死的阿
They're dying because of what we did.

1295
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:29,075
不是的 他們是因為Bethlehem才死的
They're not! They're dying because of Bethlehem...

1296
02:14:29,286 --> 02:14:32,380
因為這是個狗屎世界 如果我們要想改變它
...because this is a shitty world! lf we're going to change it...

1297
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:34,251
就總會有人要犧牲
...then someone might have to die.

1298
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:37,222
如果我可以替他們在下面受死 我願意，但我做不到
lf l could make it be me down there, l would, but l can't!

1299
02:14:40,631 --> 02:14:41,996
不要啊，求你們了
No! Please!

1300
02:14:44,435 --> 02:14:45,868
-你，滾開 -攔住她
-You, out here! -Hold her!

1301
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,435
求求你了
Please!

1302
02:15:04,521 --> 02:15:06,489
他就在某個地方
He's out there somewhere.

1303
02:15:08,258 --> 02:15:09,486
看著我們
Watching.

1304
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,726
我能感覺得到
l can feel it.

1305
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:18,932
你也感覺到了，不是嗎？
You feel it too, don't you?

1306
02:15:20,537 --> 02:15:22,869
鎮長，本來大可不必如此
lt didn't have to end like this, Sheriff!

1307
02:15:23,374 --> 02:15:27,174
他知道我在哪裡 如果他是個男人他就會現身
He knew where l'd be if he wanted to face me like a man!

1308
02:15:27,945 --> 02:15:29,537
但他卻像個兔子一樣
lnstead he's hiding...

1309
02:15:29,747 --> 02:15:31,112
躲起來了
...like a rabbit!

1310
02:15:31,582 --> 02:15:33,573
你們的郵差也不過如此
So much for your Postman!

1311
02:15:34,385 --> 02:15:35,647
中尉！
Lieutenant!

1312
02:15:36,553 --> 02:15:37,485
有!
Ready!

1313
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:40,480
我們甚至不知道他們的名字
We don't even know their names.

1314
02:15:41,692 --> 02:15:43,387
我知道
We know their names.

1315
02:15:48,565 --> 02:15:49,554
那個就是我父親
l think that's my dad.

1316
02:15:58,842 --> 02:15:59,968
瞄準！
Aim!

1317
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:02,108
繼續前進阿，郵差！
Ride, Postman!

1318
02:16:02,713 --> 02:16:04,010
繼續前進！
Ride!

1319
02:16:04,415 --> 02:16:05,609
你聽見了嗎？!
You hear me?!

1320
02:16:05,816 --> 02:16:07,681
我叫你們繼續前進！
l said, ''Ride!''

1321
02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:09,982
射擊！
Fire!

1322
02:16:33,744 --> 02:16:35,837
天哪，我都幹了些什麼啊！
My God, what have l done?

1323
02:16:38,882 --> 02:16:40,543
Ford所做的是錯的
What Ford did was wrong!

1324
02:16:44,421 --> 02:16:46,514
但我們卻沒有採取任何的措施
But it doesn't change anything...

1325
02:16:46,724 --> 02:16:49,955
來進行補救，不是嗎？
...for any of us, does it?

1326
02:17:12,783 --> 02:17:14,011
人都在這了？
ls this everybody?

1327
02:17:15,119 --> 02:17:16,552
其餘的還在趕路
The rest are on the overdue list.

1328
02:17:18,055 --> 02:17:19,613
那就是都在這了
Then this is everybody.

1329
02:17:20,824 --> 02:17:22,951
有封來自總統的信
Got a letter from the President.

1330
02:17:25,395 --> 02:17:27,022
你們好，郵遞員們！
''Greetings, all carriers.''

1331
02:17:27,231 --> 02:17:28,892
總統好！
Greetings, President Starkey!

1332
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:35,638
我一直都在和郵差保持聯絡
''l've been in contact with The Postman.

1333
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:37,670
我收到了所有的報告
And l've received all the reports.

1334
02:17:38,242 --> 02:17:39,903
我為你們自豪
l'm proud of you all.

1335
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:42,903
在暗無天日的日子裡 在這個黑暗的世界裡
ln dark days, in a weary world...

1336
02:17:43,113 --> 02:17:45,581
你們付出了所有，卻一無所求
...you gave everything and asked for nothing.

1337
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:49,175
你們打退絕望，重拾希望
You beat back despair and replaced it with hope.

1338
02:17:49,953 --> 02:17:52,319
而你的國家卻無法給你們任何回報
For that, your country can never repay you.

1339
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:54,747
但是付出的代價太大
But the price is too high...

1340
02:17:56,493 --> 02:17:59,656
而我也不想再看到我的勇士們有任何的犧牲
...and l won't see any more of my bravest die.

1341
02:18:01,231 --> 02:18:03,791
職責所在，我將要解散...
lt is my duty to hereby disband...

1342
02:18:04,001 --> 02:18:07,437
重建的美國的郵政服務
...the Postal Service of the Restored United States.

1343
02:18:08,305 --> 02:18:10,398
請將你們的制服都燒掉...
You are to burn your uniforms...

1344
02:18:10,607 --> 02:18:14,099
而郵差也將立即返回Minneapolis
...and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once.

1345
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,311
謝謝
Thank you.

1346
02:18:16,947 --> 02:18:18,574
上帝保佑你們
And God bless you all.

1347
02:18:19,516 --> 02:18:20,710
總統敬上
The President.''

1348
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:40,665
總統從沒寫過這樣的信
The President never wrote that letter.

1349
02:18:41,205 --> 02:18:43,469
如果他能寫信的話 他就會這麼寫的
lf he could've, that's what he would have said.

1350
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,537
還有一封信是給誰的？
Who's the other letter to?

1351
02:18:45,742 --> 02:18:46,970
Bethlehem.
Bethlehem.

1352
02:18:47,477 --> 02:18:49,877
-我早上就把信送過去 -信上說什麼？
-l'm taking it to him in the morning. -What's it say?

1353
02:18:50,447 --> 02:18:53,382
-內容保密，你知道這是規矩 -信上到底怎麼說的？
-Mail's private, you know that. -What does it say?

1354
02:18:54,852 --> 02:18:56,581
信上說要結束了
lt says it's over.

1355
02:18:56,954 --> 02:18:58,683
就是說我們要放棄了
lt says we quit.

1356
02:18:59,857 --> 02:19:01,757
那是你放棄了
lt says you quit!

1357
02:19:02,392 --> 02:19:03,484
誓詞是怎麼說的？
What about the oath?

1358
02:19:03,694 --> 02:19:05,423
那你告訴我
Tell me something, Ford.

1359
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:08,621
一個死了的郵遞員又能投遞幾封信呢
How much mail can a dead postman deliver?

1360
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:11,164
都結束了
lt's over.

1361
02:19:16,139 --> 02:19:17,401
那讓我去送信
Then l'll take it.

1362
02:19:17,975 --> 02:19:19,374
我信不過你
l can't trust you.

1363
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:29,213
如果這就是結局...
lf this is the end...

1364
02:19:30,954 --> 02:19:34,014
如果這是最後一封投遞的信
...if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered...

1365
02:19:36,627 --> 02:19:38,094
就讓我來發吧
...l'll take it.

1366
02:19:40,063 --> 02:19:43,328
無論誰發這封信，都有可能會犧牲
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford, probably dies for it.

1367
02:19:43,767 --> 02:19:45,894
我仍然還是個郵差！
l'm still a postman!

1368
02:19:49,373 --> 02:19:50,237
你欠我的
You owe it to me.

1369
02:19:52,242 --> 02:19:53,072
我也欠我自己的
l owe it to me.

1370
02:20:08,926 --> 02:20:10,655
那不能怪Ford
It's not Ford's fault.

1371
02:20:11,194 --> 02:20:14,960
他和你不一樣，他沒有你的那些經歷 他們都沒有
He's not like you. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do.

1372
02:20:16,166 --> 02:20:17,793
這就是他們的全部了
This is all they have.

1373
02:20:18,669 --> 02:20:21,103
-這是他們知道的唯一神聖的事 -什麼？
-lt's the only decent thing they know. -What?

1374
02:20:21,305 --> 02:20:22,704
做個郵差！
Being a postman?

1375
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:26,038
都是胡扯，Abby
lt's all bullshit, Abby.

1376
02:20:26,243 --> 02:20:27,403
全是胡扯
All of it.

1377
02:20:28,278 --> 02:20:31,213
我穿制服只是為了保暖
l took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm.

1378
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:34,414
我只是安慰他們而已
l made up the rest to stay fed.

1379
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:36,178
根本沒有所謂的...
There is no...

1380
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:38,980
重建的美國
...Restored United States.

1381
02:20:39,923 --> 02:20:41,652
我覺得事情就是如此
l figured it was something like that.

1382
02:20:41,858 --> 02:20:43,826
我要去Saint Rose
l'm going to Saint Rose.

1383
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:45,858
我帶你一起去
l'm taking you with me.

1384
02:20:46,697 --> 02:20:48,562
我已經幫你把馬準備好了
l've already packed your horse.

1385
02:20:49,466 --> 02:20:51,593
我知道你不想聽
l know you don't want to hear it...

1386
02:20:52,369 --> 02:20:54,667
但是你的腹中有我的孩子
...but that's my child inside you.

1387
02:20:55,539 --> 02:20:57,564
我想讓他出生在一個安全的地方
l want to see it born somewhere safe.

1388
02:21:21,164 --> 02:21:22,995
我想我認出你來了
l thought l recognized you.

1389
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,994
Bethlehem將軍說當我把槍指著你時 你應該跪倒在地
General Bethlehem said you should be on your knees when l do this.

1390
02:21:27,437 --> 02:21:29,337
我才不理那個混蛋說些什麼
l don't give a damn what that asshole said.

1391
02:21:30,474 --> 02:21:32,169
將軍是個了不起的人物
The general is a great man!

1392
02:21:36,747 --> 02:21:38,977
將軍就他媽的是個瘋子
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1393
02:21:44,354 --> 02:21:45,912
你想見識一下什麼是男子漢？
You want to see a man?

1394
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,356
那就是
That's a man.

1395
02:21:52,529 --> 02:21:53,621
準備好沒？
You ready?

1396
02:21:57,968 --> 02:21:59,128
好了
Yes.

1397
02:22:02,739 --> 02:22:05,037
你至少要比Bethlehem強些
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1398
02:22:06,109 --> 02:22:07,406
我看得出來
l've seen it.

1399
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:13,541
尊敬的Bethlehem
''To Bethlehem.

1400
02:22:14,518 --> 02:22:16,486
這是我的真心話
This letter is my testimony...

1401
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,520
事實上並沒有
...to the fact that there is no...

1402
02:22:19,723 --> 02:22:21,884
重建後的美國
...Restored United States...

1403
02:22:22,192 --> 02:22:24,387
也沒有什麼郵政服務
...and there is no postal service.''

1404
02:22:26,029 --> 02:22:27,496
他想讓我相信這個？
He expects me to believe this?

1405
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:28,627
這是真的
lt's true.

1406
02:22:33,136 --> 02:22:35,331
我當時就在那 他解散了郵遞員組織
l was there. He disbanded the carriers...

1407
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,073
然後向西邊走了
...and rode west.

1408
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:39,205
叛徒！
Traitor!

1409
02:22:42,145 --> 02:22:43,134
這麼說我贏了
Then l've won.

1410
02:22:50,053 --> 02:22:52,487
把我們昨天抓到的那個人帶過來 把他們一起處死
Bring the one we found yesterday. They can die together.

1411
02:22:53,757 --> 02:22:55,088
叛徒！ 你這個叛徒！
You traitor! You're a traitor!

1412
02:23:02,299 --> 02:23:04,358
那個人是那邊的二號人物
That one's the second-in-command.

1413
02:23:04,568 --> 02:23:06,763
怎麼沒讓我感到驚喜呢？
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1414
02:23:10,273 --> 02:23:11,763
我在想，長官...
l was thinking, sir...

1415
02:23:13,343 --> 02:23:16,335
對我們來說把他關起來也許更有價值
...he might be more valuable to us as a prisoner.

1416
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:19,640
本打算讓你幹掉他的
You were supposed to kill him...

1417
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:20,976
對嗎？
...weren't you?

1418
02:23:22,385 --> 02:23:24,216
但是我沒辦法靠近他
l couldn't get close enough.

1419
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,500
你是誰？
Who are you?

1420
02:23:47,544 --> 02:23:49,171
我叫Clark
My name's Clark.

1421
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:52,212
重建後的加州郵遞員
Postal Carrier for the Restored Republic of California.

1422
02:23:52,816 --> 02:23:53,874
你又是誰？
Who are you?

1423
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:02,615
郵局局長，Ford
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1424
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:12,530
萬分榮幸！
lt's an honor.

1425
02:24:16,106 --> 02:24:16,970
等一等
Wait!

1426
02:24:19,176 --> 02:24:21,303
等一等，先別開火
Wait a minute. Hold your fire.

1427
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:27,940
你們倆並不認識？
You two don't know each other?

1428
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:38,488
這將不會結束
This'll never be over.

1429
02:24:39,095 --> 02:24:40,585
會一直持續下去
lt'll go on.

1430
02:24:42,165 --> 02:24:44,690
除非我是在和一個該死的鬼魂在戰鬥
Except l'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.

1431
02:24:45,669 --> 02:24:48,229
-可以開槍了嗎？ -別開槍，該死的
-Should we fire, sir? -No, goddamn it!

1432
02:24:49,706 --> 02:24:51,435
我不會和鬼魂打仗
l won't fight a ghost.

1433
02:24:53,977 --> 02:24:55,308
Tabula...
Tabula...

1434
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:57,276
...rasa...
...rasa...

1435
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,742
...先生們
...gentlemen.

1436
02:24:59,716 --> 02:25:01,616
一段清白的歷史
A clean slate.

1437
02:25:02,552 --> 02:25:05,544
我要對所有的郵遞員窮追猛打
l want all mail carriers hunted down.

1438
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:08,823
我一定要找到那個郵差
l want The Postman found.

1439
02:25:09,025 --> 02:25:10,959
我要狠狠地打擊他
l want him dealt with.

1440
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:13,556
上校，集合部隊
Colonel, organize the scouts.

1441
02:25:15,365 --> 02:25:16,559
你說他往西走了？
You said he rode west?

1442
02:25:22,038 --> 02:25:23,903
而這是他的二號人物？
And this is his second-in-command?

1443
02:25:27,978 --> 02:25:29,138
是的，長官
Yes, sir!

1444
02:25:42,425 --> 02:25:45,690
我會留你一條命用來談判 要讓郵差投鼠忌器
l'll keep you to bargain with. The Postman is weak that way.

1445
02:26:36,279 --> 02:26:38,213
把槍扔到地上
Set your rifle on the ground!

1446
02:26:38,982 --> 02:26:40,882
扔到地上
Set it on the ground.

1447
02:26:42,485 --> 02:26:44,612
什麼？這個破玩意？
What? This old thing?

1448
02:26:46,256 --> 02:26:47,382
子彈都沒上上去呢
lt isn't even loaded.

1449
02:26:48,725 --> 02:26:50,215
我們這是在哪裡？
Where are we?

1450
02:26:51,294 --> 02:26:53,262
你們在大橋城
You're in Bridge City...

1451
02:26:55,198 --> 02:26:57,223
而這裡不允許槍支
...where we don't allow guns.

1452
02:27:07,777 --> 02:27:09,506
崗哨說你要來了
The sentry said you were coming.

1453
02:27:17,554 --> 02:27:19,488
我知道你，你...
l know you. You're...

1454
02:27:20,056 --> 02:27:20,852
...很出名
...famous.

1455
02:27:22,625 --> 02:27:24,058
曾經是...
l was once...

1456
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,522
...有那麼...
...sort of...

1457
02:27:25,729 --> 02:27:26,991
一點點
...kind of.

1458
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,696
不再是了
Not anymore.

1459
02:27:29,632 --> 02:27:30,428
你們要穿過去？
Looking to cross?

1460
02:27:31,334 --> 02:27:32,562
是的
We will be.

1461
02:27:33,503 --> 02:27:36,438
但現在我們想要一些吃的
Right now we'd appreciate some food.

1462
02:27:38,208 --> 02:27:39,505
沒問題
Okay.

1463
02:27:40,443 --> 02:27:41,910
在我們後面，還有幾個孩子
There are some kids behind us.

1464
02:27:42,112 --> 02:27:43,079
幾個？
How many?

1465
02:27:43,279 --> 02:27:44,109
3個
3.

1466
02:27:45,014 --> 02:27:46,845
3個，好吧
3. Okay.

1467
02:27:49,886 --> 02:27:51,547
進來吧，孩子們
Come on in, guys!

1468
02:27:53,923 --> 02:27:55,982
我知道你們就在那
l know you're out there.

1469
02:29:07,831 --> 02:29:10,061
-等等，等一等 -他想要什麼？
-Wait. Just wait. -What did he want?

1470
02:29:11,835 --> 02:29:13,632
請安靜，他說...
Hold on. He says...

1471
02:29:13,837 --> 02:29:16,032
...他在尋找郵差
...he's looking for The Postman.

1472
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:18,598
再沒有這樣一回事了
There's no such thing anymore.

1473
02:29:22,312 --> 02:29:25,145
但那個騎馬的人說有這麼一回事
The man on the horse says there is.

1474
02:29:25,682 --> 02:29:27,513
他認為郵差就在這裡
He thinks he's here.

1475
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:30,078
而他會帶著他的同夥再回來
And he's coming back with friends.

1476
02:29:35,492 --> 02:29:37,426
郵差時幹嗎的？
What's a postman?

1477
02:29:55,278 --> 02:29:56,643
你從來沒聽說過郵差？
You never heard of a postman?

1478
02:30:34,317 --> 02:30:35,443
你就是那個郵差？
Are you The Postman?

1479
02:30:41,224 --> 02:30:42,248
對
Yeah.

1480
02:30:43,726 --> 02:30:45,455
夥計，我聽說過你啊
l heard of you, man.

1481
02:30:46,362 --> 02:30:47,795
你很出名
You're famous.

1482
02:30:49,766 --> 02:30:51,495
也許，是吧
Yeah, l guess l am.

1483
02:30:53,202 --> 02:30:54,931
但突然之間 我已經...
And all of a sudden, l'm not...

1484
02:30:55,438 --> 02:30:57,406
...不再是個郵差了
...wearing the right clothes.

1485
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:14,185
夥計，你會喜歡上這玩意的
Man, you're going to love this!

1486
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:17,287
打開第二道瀑布
Open that second chute, bro!

1487
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:36,174
郵差先生，你很有天賦
You have a gift, Postman.

1488
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:40,180
在Pineview，我看見它又回來了
l saw it back in Pineview.

1489
02:31:42,652 --> 02:31:45,519
你給了我們都已經遺忘了的寶貴財富
You've given us all back what we'd forgotten.

1490
02:31:47,423 --> 02:31:50,449
你讓March覺得她彷彿重見光明
You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again.

1491
02:31:52,195 --> 02:31:55,790
你讓Ford覺得他就是這個世界的一分子
You made Ford feel like he was part of the world.

1492
02:31:58,735 --> 02:32:01,169
你給了我們希望...
You give out hope like it was...

1493
02:32:01,371 --> 02:32:03,339
...就像點亮你口袋裡的蠟燭
...candy in your pocket.

1494
02:32:19,455 --> 02:32:20,820
你還記得這個嗎？
Remember this?

1495
02:32:22,558 --> 02:32:23,957
我記得
l remember.

1496
02:32:25,561 --> 02:32:28,428
我常想，你是故意把這個留給我的
l always like to think that you left it on purpose.

1497
02:32:34,103 --> 02:32:36,128
這對我來說很不容易
This is hard for me.

1498
02:32:40,576 --> 02:32:43,670
Michael是我見過的最好的男人
Michael was the best man l ever knew.

1499
02:32:46,382 --> 02:32:49,977
我從來沒想過 我會像愛他那樣去愛另外一個人
l never thought there'd be another man l could love the way l loved him.

1500
02:32:53,856 --> 02:32:56,518
我沒法看得那麼遠
l couldn't see it for so long.

1501
02:32:59,162 --> 02:33:00,993
而你現在就要離開
And now you're leaving.

1502
02:33:05,501 --> 02:33:06,627
我害怕
And l'm afraid.

1503
02:33:10,206 --> 02:33:12,766
我害怕你再也找不到你的Saint Rose
l'm afraid you'll never find your Saint Rose.

1504
02:33:13,543 --> 02:33:14,407
這不重要
lt's not important.

1505
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:17,340
我害怕你再也看不到你的小孩
l'm afraid you'll never see your baby.

1506
02:33:45,575 --> 02:33:49,409
我需要充足的電源！ 這個傢伙要走很遠的路呢！
l need full power, man! This dude's got a long way to go!

1507
02:33:54,317 --> 02:33:56,376
這機器運轉得真他媽的完美
This thing's working perfect, man!

1508
02:34:08,331 --> 02:34:10,356
比看起來還要高很多，不是嗎？
A lot higher than it looks, huh?

1509
02:34:20,409 --> 02:34:21,842
你差點就報銷了
You nearly went.

1510
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:25,339
快進來吧
Get in.

1511
02:34:27,016 --> 02:34:29,644
在前面有三個規模很大的鎮子
There's 3 good-sized towns up ahead...

1512
02:34:29,852 --> 02:34:33,447
如果你能說服他們跟你走 你就能找到足夠的幫手
...with enough people to help you if you can convince them to come.

1513
02:34:36,993 --> 02:34:38,756
不要告訴任何人
Don't tell anybody...

1514
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:42,226
說我喜歡玩這玩意，僅僅因為它好玩
...l like to ride this damn thing just for the hell of it.

1515
02:34:42,431 --> 02:34:45,696
你知道，作為一個領導 我得注意自身形象
Being a city official has its perks, you know?

1516
02:34:53,709 --> 02:34:57,440
相信我吧，夥計 這會讓你更快的
Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster.

1517
02:35:03,052 --> 02:35:04,246
我怎麼停下來呢？
How do l stop?

1518
02:35:04,754 --> 02:35:07,018
別再這裡婆婆媽媽了
Quit worrying about the little things.

1519
02:35:07,223 --> 02:35:09,214
祝你好運，跑得飛快！
Good luck, and Godspeed.

1520
02:35:25,408 --> 02:35:27,467
長官，我向您報告！
Reporting for duty, sir!

1521
02:35:27,677 --> 02:35:29,304
-知道該怎麼做嗎？ -去說服人們
-Know what to do? -Talk to the people.

1522
02:35:29,846 --> 02:35:31,211
告訴他們這很重要
Tell them it's important.

1523
02:35:31,414 --> 02:35:32,745
告訴他們我們可以做到
Tell them we can make a difference.

1524
02:35:33,816 --> 02:35:37,308
再向前衝，親愛的朋友們 再向前衝
''Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...

1525
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,852
...或者以死守衛我們的城牆
...or close the wall with our dead!

1526
02:35:40,223 --> 02:35:44,250
在和平時期，我們要謙虛彬彬有禮
In peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility.

1527
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:47,258
但是一旦爆發戰爭
But when the blast of war blows in our ears...

1528
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:49,590
我們就要像頭猛虎一樣勇猛
...then imitate the action of the tiger.

1529
02:35:49,799 --> 02:35:54,099
鼓起我們的勇氣 收起我們溫和的本性...
Summon up the blood. Disguise fair nature with rage...

1530
02:35:54,303 --> 02:35:57,466
去和敵人拚個你死我活
...and lend the eye a terrible aspect. ''

1531
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,440
-他們是誰？ -不知道
-Who are they? -l don't know.

1532
02:36:42,652 --> 02:36:45,780
在我看來大部分都是老弱病殘
Looks like mostly women and young people to me.

1533
02:36:45,988 --> 02:36:47,114
有多少？
How many?

1534
02:36:47,556 --> 02:36:48,818
那是一支軍隊
lt's an army.

1535
02:36:59,635 --> 02:37:01,125
終於...
At last...

1536
02:37:01,437 --> 02:37:04,998
還是有人鼓起用來和我作戰了
...someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.

1537
02:37:09,512 --> 02:37:11,002
先生們，算總賬的時候到了
Reckoning, gentlemen!

1538
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:06,930
他們看起來熱血沸騰
They're an eager-looking bunch!

1539
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:37,594
士氣真的是很重要
Morale is a dangerous thing.

1540
02:38:39,568 --> 02:38:41,399
把俘虜帶上來
Bring up the prisoner!

1541
02:38:42,038 --> 02:38:43,938
讓我們來告訴他們 遊戲該怎麼來玩
We'll show them how this game is played.

1542
02:39:26,415 --> 02:39:27,712
呆在這
Stay here.

1543
02:39:42,298 --> 02:39:43,322
他在投降？
ls he surrendering?

1544
02:39:43,799 --> 02:39:45,528
該死，我不希望這樣
God, l hope not.

1545
02:40:07,423 --> 02:40:09,050
小小搬運工
My little shipping clerk.

1546
02:40:09,658 --> 02:40:11,489
賣複印機的銷售員
Mr. copy-machine salesman.

1547
02:40:12,761 --> 02:40:14,592
我們倆是一對大騙子
We're both a couple of frauds.

1548
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:18,161
說的沒錯
So be it.

1549
02:40:19,535 --> 02:40:23,096
但是一個偉人是由另一個偉人來成就的
But great men are made by other great men.

1550
02:40:23,706 --> 02:40:24,968
Rommel成就了Patton
Patton had Rommel.

1551
02:40:25,574 --> 02:40:27,599
Lee成就了Grant
Grant had Lee.

1552
02:40:28,344 --> 02:40:29,311
而你將會成就我的霸業
But l get you.

1553
02:40:30,045 --> 02:40:31,478
你不是將軍
You're no general.

1554
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:33,980
你甚至也不是一個好的畫家
You're not even a good painter.

1555
02:40:36,452 --> 02:40:38,044
你想要激將我？
Trying to goad me into a fight?

1556
02:40:38,254 --> 02:40:41,951
如果戰爭由發起它的人來結束，就非常完美
lt'd be great if wars were fought just by the assholes who started them.

1557
02:40:43,792 --> 02:40:45,282
我們可以對這場戰爭作個了結
We could settle this right here...

1558
02:40:46,529 --> 02:40:47,791
只有你跟我
...you and me.

1559
02:40:49,798 --> 02:40:51,857
不幸的是，這種方法行不通
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

1560
02:40:52,067 --> 02:40:53,830
但是在你的部隊裡卻可以
But it does in your army.

1561
02:40:54,803 --> 02:40:56,828
我引用八大法律中的...
l invoke Law Seven...

1562
02:40:57,506 --> 02:40:58,598
...第七條
...of the Laws of Eight!

1563
02:41:00,643 --> 02:41:04,602
在部隊裡誰都可以挑戰老大的位子
''Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!''

1564
02:41:04,813 --> 02:41:05,643
我向你挑戰
l challenge you.

1565
02:41:05,848 --> 02:41:10,148
你不是我們一夥的，你沒有這個權力
You're not a Holnist. You're not a member. You don't have the right.

1566
02:41:10,352 --> 02:41:12,149
我擁有所有的權力
l have every right!

1567
02:41:18,093 --> 02:41:19,458
我引用第七條法律
l invoke Law Seven.

1568
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,828
你去哪...?
Where...?

1569
02:41:45,221 --> 02:41:46,483
我要挑戰...
l challenge...

1570
02:41:46,689 --> 02:41:48,452
...老大的位子
...for leadership of the clan!

1571
02:41:48,657 --> 02:41:50,284
我在哪裡見過你？
Where do l know you from?

1572
02:41:51,093 --> 02:41:52,651
你下令搶劫...
''Cry havoc...

1573
02:41:53,062 --> 02:41:55,155
...然後餵養這些戰爭走狗
...and let slip the dogs of war!''

1574
02:41:56,332 --> 02:41:57,458
你還記得那些嗎？
You remember that?

1575
02:41:59,935 --> 02:42:01,300
莎士比亞
Shakespeare.

1576
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:04,301
那個不想打仗的人
The one who didn't want to fight.

1577
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:08,535
那時我就應該設法殺死你 但你看起來太強大
l should have found a way to kill you then, but you seemed so strong.

1578
02:42:10,279 --> 02:42:11,507
第七條法律...
Law Seven...

1579
02:42:12,848 --> 02:42:14,008
...那就是
...it is!

1580
02:42:15,117 --> 02:42:17,051
這場戰爭將在這裡作個了結
This war is settled here!

1581
02:43:44,139 --> 02:43:45,800
我研究過人們
l studied people.

1582
02:43:47,276 --> 02:43:49,210
我知道你的問題在哪
l know your problem.

1583
02:43:49,878 --> 02:43:51,140
你知道...
Do you know...

1584
02:43:51,347 --> 02:43:53,372
為什麼你不能打嗎？
...why you can't fight?

1585
02:43:55,584 --> 02:43:58,815
因為你不知道為何而戰
Because you have nothing to fight for.

1586
02:44:01,523 --> 02:44:03,491
你什麼也不關心
You don't care about anything.

1587
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:07,222
你什麼也不在乎
You don't value anything.

1588
02:44:07,696 --> 02:44:10,426
你對什麼都不信任
You don't believe in anything!

1589
02:44:10,632 --> 02:44:12,759
而那些卻讓我變得更厲害
And that's what makes me better.

1590
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:16,469
我信任...
l believe...

1591
02:44:17,206 --> 02:44:19,299
...美國
...in the United States.

1592
02:44:58,947 --> 02:45:01,882
我們本可以不這樣的
lt doesn't have to be this way.

1593
02:45:02,818 --> 02:45:05,048
我們本可以不用互相殘殺
We don't have to kill each other.

1594
02:45:07,423 --> 02:45:08,981
第三條法律...
''Law Three:

1595
02:45:09,625 --> 02:45:10,853
仁慈...
Mercy...

1596
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:12,750
...是留給弱者的
...is for the weak.''

1597
02:45:12,961 --> 02:45:14,519
Ford，不要
Ford, don't!

1598
02:45:14,797 --> 02:45:16,196
第八條法律
''Law Eight:

1599
02:45:16,598 --> 02:45:18,998
只有一種懲罰...
There's only one penalty...

1600
02:45:19,835 --> 02:45:22,030
...而那就是死
...and that penalty is death.''

1601
02:45:27,843 --> 02:45:29,367
他不值得的
He isn't worth it.

1602
02:45:33,115 --> 02:45:35,140
現在我是部隊的頭兒
l'm the head of the clan now!

1603
02:45:37,352 --> 02:45:39,081
將會產生新的法律
There are going to be new laws!

1604
02:45:40,556 --> 02:45:41,921
第一條：
Law One:

1605
02:45:43,725 --> 02:45:45,192
不再殺戮
No more killing.

1606
02:45:46,094 --> 02:45:48,187
我們將擁有和平
There's going to be peace!

1607
02:46:06,081 --> 02:46:08,072
你覺得這樣如何？
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury?

1608
02:46:14,423 --> 02:46:15,754
Ford，要像個領袖的樣子
Be a leader, Ford.

1609
02:46:19,094 --> 02:46:20,561
第八條法律
Law Eight:

1610
02:46:25,534 --> 02:46:26,865
活著...
Live...

1611
02:46:27,069 --> 02:46:28,627
...就好好活
...and let live.

1612
02:47:53,121 --> 02:47:55,021
你爸爸寫信來說
Your daddy wrote to tell you...

1613
02:47:55,223 --> 02:47:57,919
他會盡快趕回來的
...he'll be here as soon as he can...

1614
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:00,685
他非常愛你
...and that he loves you very much.

1615
02:48:08,637 --> 02:48:10,070
信件太慢了
Mail's slow.

1616
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:13,631
我打算親自來告訴她
l'm going to have to see about that.

1617
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:47,531
你的女兒
Your daughter.

1618
02:48:49,711 --> 02:48:51,770
她的名字叫希望
Her name is Hope.

1619
02:49:22,577 --> 02:49:24,841
我父親看到我們是如此的脆弱...
My father saw how fragile we are...

1620
02:49:25,047 --> 02:49:28,483
...如此輕易的就落入暴君的統治
...and how quickly we fell into the hands of tyranny.

1621
02:49:29,451 --> 02:49:31,214
他發現普通人...
He saw that ordinary men...

1622
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:34,719
...也可以有潛力可挖，可以找到勇氣
...could reach deep within themselves and find courage.

1623
02:49:35,090 --> 02:49:38,753
他發現如果我們作為一個國家來溝通...
He saw that if we began to communicate as a nation...

1624
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,860
...我們就可以再一次強大起來
...we could become strong again...

1625
02:49:41,063 --> 02:49:42,325
團結起來
...united.

1626
02:49:43,065 --> 02:49:45,431
但是他從來沒有真正見到過Saint Rose
But he never did see Saint Rose.

1627
02:49:47,002 --> 02:49:48,333
他說...
He said...

1628
02:49:49,004 --> 02:49:50,995
...還有太多的事情要去做
...there was too much to be done.

1629
02:49:52,641 --> 02:49:54,131
他許下承諾
He'd made a promise.

1630
02:49:54,676 --> 02:49:57,804
他信守承諾 追逐一個又一個的夢想
And in keeping it, he traded one dream for another.

1631
02:49:58,447 --> 02:50:00,005
無怨無悔
With no regrets.

1632
02:50:03,552 --> 02:50:05,952
所以，為了向我的父親表示敬意....
And so, in honor of my father....

1633
02:50:44,793 --> 02:50:46,454
那個小孩是我
That was me.

1634
02:51:14,390 --> 02:51:38,890
