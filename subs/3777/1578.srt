长官，我不是不尊敬你 不过你最好还是把我放了
No disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off letting me go.

201
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,885
把我逼上绝路我就是个斗士
A fighter is about the last thing that l am.

202

Does anyone wish to challenge me?

288
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:14,733
起立
On your feet.

289
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,202
第八条：
Law Eight:

290
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:25,245
只有一项惩罚，死！
There's only one penalty. Death.

291
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,006
求你了，求求你了
Please! l'm begging you!

292
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,801
在这里，有付出就会有回报
You will get out of this army what you put into it.

293
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,665
你工作你就会有得吃
Work and you'll be fed.

294
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,373
你战斗你就会被人所尊敬

295
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,278
你战死你就会被人所怀念
Die and you'll be remembered.

296
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,961
你想着要挑战我的老大地位？
You thinking of challenging for leadership?

297
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,786
我没有，长官
No, sir.

298
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,625
我只是个跟随者...
l'm a follower...

299
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,433
...而不是领导者
...not a leader.

300
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,159
你倒是挺伶牙俐齿的...
You got a smart mouth...

301
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,564
...莎士比亚
...Shakespeare.

302
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,964
你知不知道Getty上校一直追随着将军？
You see Colonel Getty always following the General?

303
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,100
但他最后却向将军挑战
He was the last man ever to challenge.

304
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,972
战斗持续了6秒...
Fight lasted 6 seconds...

305
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:33,382
...但将军没有杀他
...but he didn't kill him.

306
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,475
只是割下他的舌头...
Cut off his tongue...

307
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:38,051
...再割下他的软蛋
...then he cut off his balls.

308
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:42,952
而老Getty从此就像只忠诚的狗一样追随着将军
And old Getty's been following him around like a dog ever since.

309
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:45,318
解散
Fall out!

310
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,397
将军没注意...
The General don't see it...

311
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,998
...但是我说你有反骨
...but l say you've got some nigger in you.

312
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,753
这些都是你的？
They're yours?

313
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,532
真是个独行侠阿？
A solitary man, aren't you?

314
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,995
用望远镜可以从远处观察生活，而Shakespeare...
Binoculars to watch life from a distance and Shakespeare...

315
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,502
...却是读生活而不过日子
...to read about it, instead of living it.

316
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:34,340
我无意冒犯你 但是你自己好像已经读过莎士比亚的...
No offense, but you seem to have read Shakespeare...

317
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,636
...作品
...yourself.

318
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:41,248
如果他想要上档次 而不是仅仅干些暗杀之类的...
lf he wishes to rise above mere thuggery...

319
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,648
...一个军事指挥官必须受过正规传统的教育...
...a military commander must be classically educated...

320
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:48,119
...哲学、历史甚至戏剧敏感性
...philosophy and history, even a sense of the dramatic.

321
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:54,354
你以为我在战前是干什么工作的？
What do you think that l did before the war?

322
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:57,028
你以为我是个军人？
Do you think that l was in the army?

323
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,898
我卖复印机的
l sold copying machines.

324
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:01,668
我是个销售员...
l was a salesman...

325
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,630
...却有着领导天赋 设计并秘密的执行...
...with the talent to lead men, devise and execute a battle plan...

326
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,435
...军事计划
...locked away inside.

327
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:12,911
要不是Nathan Holn的话 我现在还在卖复印机
lf Nathan Holn hadn't come along, l'd still be selling copying machines.

328
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,409
你能想象...
Can you imagine...

329
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:19,145
...被浪费的生命 你能想象浪费有多严重吗？
...the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of that?

330
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:21,484
但是战争...
But war...

331
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,692
...给了像我这样的人一个机会
...war gives men like me a chance.

332
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,287
Here.

333
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:34,933
“奖杯总是名花无主的
''The prize is often left unclaimed.

334
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,867
我们必须鼓起勇气来...
We must have the courage to grasp it...

335
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,737
...因为未来总是偏爱胆大的人”

他总是激励着我

我对未来已经有了设计，一个总体规划
l have a design for the future. A master plan.

338
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,963
我需要个能干的军官来帮我实现
l will need able officers to help me carry it out.

339
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,129
你有这个才能

340
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,098
如果你忠心...
lf your heart matches...

...你可以走得很远
...you will go far.

342
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,601
我们接下来几周再详谈
We'll talk more in weeks to come.

343
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,276
解散

利用望远镜作侦查

347
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,786
书呢，长官？

348

烧了它
Burn it.

349
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,597
出去
Quit moving!

350

-怎么样，他怎么说？ -没什么
-What happened? What'd he say? -Nothing.

363
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,249
有人射了一只狮子

他们爬进来灌木丛

那些人今天早上猎杀了一只狮子

368
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,141

不管怎样第三个人得跟着过去

我们不知道他是死还是活

我不这么想，队长

活着回来，你就可以吃烤狮子了

01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:59,433
不，我没有
No, it's not.

575
01:01:02,677 --> 01:01:03,701
我只是问你...
l'm only asking...

576
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:06,873
...因为我想让你使我怀孕
...because l want you to make me pregnant.

577
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,509
好吧...
All right...

578
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:12,212
...这就对了
...that's it.

579
01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:13,946
等等
Wait.

580
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:15,553
请等一等
Wait, please.

581
01:01:18,393 --> 01:01:20,588
好像是个穿制服的
lt's got to be the uniform.

582
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:24,555
这是我丈夫，Michael 他没有反对
This is my husband, Michael. He hasn't said no.

583
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,928
我什么也没说
l haven't said anything yet.

584
01:01:28,169 --> 01:01:30,899
我们连续三年一直都打算要个孩子
We've been trying to have a baby for 3 years.

585
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,506
我们不能指望他 他一岁时就已经的了腮腺炎
We cannot on account of Michael. He had the bad mumps when he was 1 .

586
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:37,708
所以我们需要一个捐精者
So we need a body father.

587
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,708
我们本可以在这里找一个 但这样会带来很多问题
We could ask a man here, but it may cause problems.

588
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,474
我们见到过这样的事
We've seen it happen.

589
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:48,417
在女人没表现出来以前都没问题 但之后就很麻烦了
Things go okay until the woman shows, then it can be difficult.

590
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,784
但是你只是路过这里发发信件
But you'll only be around once in a while with the mail.

591
01:01:54,729 --> 01:01:56,492
你是个邮差
You're the postman.

592
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,621
你觉得怎么样？
What do you say, mister?

593
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,093
你得帮我们一个忙
You'd do us a favor.

594
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:06,865
我会考虑考虑
l'm going to think about it.

595
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:17,049
请原谅
Excuse me.

596
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:21,979
我妈妈想给你些东西
My mother would like to give you something.

597
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,357
妈妈，他就在这里
He's right here, Mom.

598
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:30,062
这是给我另外一个女儿的...
lt's to my other daughter...

599
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:31,561
...她叫安妮
...Annie.

600
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,168
信上没说她在哪
lt doesn't say where.

601
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:48,204
她五年前离开了这 我们不知道她在哪里
We don't know where she is. She left 5 years ago.

602
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,680
我们听说她住在北部
The last we heard she was living up north.

603
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:55,215
我说，March夫人 你应该知道--
Look, Mrs. March, you should know that--

604
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,654
知道什么？
lKnow what?

605
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,999
我对你有种直觉
l have a feeling about you.

606
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:10,203
我知道你会答应我的
l know you'll do what's right.

607
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:30,517
我得赶紧离开这鬼地方
l got to get out of here.

608
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:46,967
放松，宝贝
Easy, boy.

609
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,836
就在那个角落
lt's right around the corner.

610
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:54,876
什么东西？
What is?

611
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,709
你正在找的东西
What you're looking for.

612
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:09,797
我在找什么？
What l'm looking for?

613
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:15,730
疯狂的老白痴
Crazy old coot.

614
01:04:58,045 --> 01:04:59,603
我就知道你会来的
l knew you'd come here.

615
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,380
是吗？
You did?

616
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,617
你是如何成为一个邮差的？
So how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?

617
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:15,693
在正确的时候你得出现在正确的地点
You have to be in the right place at the right time.

618
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,658
我怎么才能做到呢？
How can l do it?

619
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,399
-我还以为你想要开车呢 -不再想了，那时小孩子的玩意
-l thought you wanted to drive cars. -Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.

620
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:25,970
这是现实
This is real.

621
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,302
那正确的地点又在哪里？
So where's the right place?

622
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:33,544
你知道，可能在任何时间的任何地点
Could be anywhere, you know. Anytime.

623
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:37,643
只有另外一个邮差才能让你成为一个邮差
Only another postman can make you a postman.

624
01:05:37,952 --> 01:05:39,943
就像吸血鬼那样？
lKind of like vampires, right?

625
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,451
对，有点像那样
Yeah, something like that.

626
01:05:46,494 --> 01:05:47,984
你必须得发誓
You have to be sworn in, so....

627
01:05:54,268 --> 01:05:58,034
邮局有些不太稳定，也许持续不了多久
The organization's kind of shaky right now. lt might not last.

628
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,570
怎么发誓？
What does?

629
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:04,177
你将会碰到一些根本不信任你的人
You'd meet people who don't believe in you.

630
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,107
我会和他们坦诚相待
l'll set them straight.

631
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:09,643
邮差是个孤独的工作
lt's a lonely job.

632
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:13,046
我这一生都孤独
l've been lonely all my life.

633
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:16,513
我也一样，Ford
So have l, Ford.

634
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:18,858
我也一样啊
So have l.

635
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:21,887
真该死！
What the hell!

636
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:24,196
你跟着我念
You repeat after me.

637
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:29,826
“无论大雪还是...
''Neither snow...

638
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,333
还是暴雨...
...nor rain...

639
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:32,936
无论是炎炎烈日...
...nor heat...

640
01:06:33,474 --> 01:06:34,634
还是漆黑夜晚...
...nor gloom of night...

641
01:06:39,614 --> 01:06:41,309
邮差...
...stays these couriers...

642
01:06:42,149 --> 01:06:45,880
都会迅速的完成他们的任务”
...from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.''

643
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:48,581
好了，可以了
Okay, then.

644
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:49,448
好了，可以了
Okay, then.

645
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:54,027
不，我说可以了 你听就行了
No, l'm saying that. You just listen.

646
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:55,456
对不起
l'm sorry.

647
01:06:57,465 --> 01:07:00,593
经过我的授权，现在你可以投递这些信件了
By my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail.

648
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:03,033
恭喜你
Congratulations.

649
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,103
你是个邮差了
You're a postman.

650
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,147
为了送信我会万死不辞
l'd die to get a letter through.

651
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,414
你说什么？
What did you say?

652
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:21,513
-我说，为了送信我会万死不辞 -Johnny!
-l said l'd die to get a letter through. -Johnny!

653
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:23,655
你怎么还不走开
Why don't you run along.

654
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,550
我要和他说几句话
l need to speak to this man.

655
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:29,654
我待会再找你
l'll see you around.

656
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:32,261
就这么说定了，Ford
Sure thing, Ford.

657
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:39,029
Johnny对你印象很好 整个镇子的人对你印象都很好
Johnny is impressed with you. Whole town is impressed with you.

658
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,969
我猜不包括你吧
l take it you're not.

659
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,576
-你比你看起来的要聪明的多 -有什么可以效劳的？
-You're smarter than you look. -What can l do for you?

660
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:49,273
要么你自己自动消失要么我把你赶走 两条路随你挑
You can either clear out or l can throw you out. Either way suits me.

661
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:53,416
你还没搞明白 我是由政府授权的--
You don't understand. l'm a government employee authorized by--

662
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:56,215
你被授权个屁！
You are not authorized by shit!

663
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,152
你只是逃难到了这里 你只不过是个...
You were trying to sneak out of here. You are nothing...

664
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,626
发现了一袋信件的流浪汉 我要你滚出我的镇子
...but a drifter who found a bag of mail. l want you out of town.

665
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:07,862
好吧，我会把这都写进我的报告
All right. This is going in my report.

666
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:11,137
邮差先生，这里的人们不需要梦想
These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman.

667
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,069
他们需要一些实际的东西 他们需要Holnists的帮助
They need something real. They need help with the Holnists.

668
01:08:15,276 --> 01:08:17,267
你能带给他们这些吗？
Are you going to bring them that?

669
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:20,980
我想不能吧
Didn't think so.

670
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,916
到目前为止你带给我们的只是 几碗汤还有几颗破碎的心
All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.

671
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:29,146
我要这个地方保持原样
l aim to keep it that way.

672
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:31,692
你可以在这待到明天早上...
You can stay here till morning...

673
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,827
以后我就再也不想看见你了
...then l don't ever want to see you again.

674
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,247
Benning
''Benning.

Boston？
Boston''?

677
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,628
这些家伙--
What the hell these people--

678
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,524
走开
Just leave it.

679
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:16,603
我叫你走开
l said, leave it.

680
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:24,711
Saint Rose？
''Saint Rose''?

681
01:09:50,237 --> 01:09:51,101
你好，Abby
Hello, Abby.

682
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:55,665
你明天就要走了？
You'll be leaving tomorrow?

683
01:09:57,878 --> 01:09:59,106
是吧
l guess.

684
01:10:04,351 --> 01:10:07,684
每个人都在熬夜写信 等着你帮他们带走
Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take.

685
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:10,618
他们都很兴奋
They're so excited.

686
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:14,426
那你呢？你写信了没有？
And how about you? Do you have a letter?

687
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,129
我不知道要写给谁
l don't have anybody to write to.

688
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,528
我可以给你找个笔友
l'll find you a pen pal.

689
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:24,767
就是有着相同爱好的一些人
Someone with similar interests. You know?

690
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,701
比如说跳舞了，还有...
Like dancing and...

691
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,304
检查腮腺炎
...checking for mumps.

692
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:31,307
你很风趣
You're funny.

693
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,677
镇上的人几乎都不懂风趣了
Hardly anybody's funny around here.

694
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:43,680
你已经决定了没有？
Have you decided yet?

695
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:57,966
我一直都在考虑
Been thinking about it.

696
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:22,292
当然了
Sure.

697
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:24,186
我是说...
l mean...

698
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:26,931
为什么不呢？
...why not?

699
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:36,008
天啊，你真是太....
God, you're so....

700
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:38,137
你太...
You're so...

701
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,341
漂亮了
...beautiful.

702
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,451
对不起，也许你希望这更像是个医疗手术
l'm sorry, you probably want to keep things more clinical.

703
01:11:47,788 --> 01:11:50,018
你甚至不知道我的名字
You don't even know my name.

704
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,690
我不想知道
l don't want to.

705
01:12:00,334 --> 01:12:01,926
如果你把眼睛闭上的话...
lt would be easier for me...

706
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:04,263
我会觉得更自然
...if you closed your eyes.

707
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,079
邮差先生，我们经过讨论
We took a vote, Mr. Postman.

708
01:14:32,686 --> 01:14:34,085
希望你能收下
We want you to have this.

709
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:42,793
所以你不能拒绝
So you can't say no.

710
01:14:48,802 --> 01:14:50,326
我收下了
l'll take it.

711
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,938
一卷铺盖、一些麦片还有一周的干粮
You got a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.

712
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,402
很好
Good.

713
01:14:58,011 --> 01:14:59,069
谢谢

哪里？
Go?

716
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:10,287
西方...

717

然后我又会再返回来
...then l'll work my way...

718
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:17,160
就像走个"8"字形
...back here, sort of a figure eight.

719
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:26,430
现在的情况是困难了点
Times seem hard right now.

720
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,004
但是你们要坚信会越来越好的
But you got to believe things are getting better.

721
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:34,046
鸟儿又开始迁徙了
Birds are migrating again.

722
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:35,838
雨季来临了

局势正在逐渐好转

725
01:15:43,223 --> 01:15:44,884
Oh beautiful

726
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:50,790
For spacious skies

727
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:54,126
For amber waves of grain

728
01:15:58,639 --> 01:15:59,970
该死
Shit!

729
01:16:00,874 --> 01:16:02,637
无论你是谁 你还是显得有些紧张
You've got a hell of a nerve, whoever you are.

730
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:12,178
今天早上你看见Abby了吗？

我就送你到这里了

732

你自己上路吧
You're on your own.

733
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:21,426
God shed his grace on thee

734
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:27,524
And crown thy good

735
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:29,861
With brotherhood

736
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,001
你真的像你说的是个邮差吗？
Are you really who you say you are?

737
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:36,008
如果我带着信件回来...

你就会相信了

739
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,050
该死
Goddamn it!

740
01:17:16,516 --> 01:17:18,575
你看什么？
What are you looking at?

741
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:21,277
全身
Everything.

742
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:24,017
他们通常不看我的
They don't usually look at me.

743
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,761
那个...
Who is responsible...

744
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:44,500
...是谁干的？
...for that?

Holnists,Johnny 你得呆在--

-You got to stay out of sight. -l'm a postman!

我不会当逃兵的！

呆在这里 不然我会亲自把你锁起来！
Stay out of this, or l will lock you up myself.

752
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:25,503
你得负责

753
01:19:34,388 --> 01:19:36,686
去把旗子烧了

从窗户扔进邮局

757
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,291

...并不存在！
...doesn't exist!

759
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,568
那面国旗就是垃圾
That flag is an abomination!

760
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:52,331
有一个最奇怪的小山羊 它躲在栅栏后面....
There was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it....

761
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,036
我看着它而它脸色就变了
l looked at it and it had a color to it.

762

01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:50,585
你知道我们在这里执行的是什么政府体制吗？
Do you know what system of government we have here?

775
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:56,451
我们执行的是所谓的联邦体系 就像中世纪那样
We have what is known as a feudal system, like in the Middle Ages.

776
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:59,530

That's lords and vassals. That's you and me.

777

现在那些君主
Now those lords...

778

他们有些想法
...they had some ideas.

779
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,998
他们认为如果一个臣子结婚了
They believed that if a vassal got married...

780
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:09,300
那君主就有权...
...it was the lord's right...

781
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:10,703
有权...
...his right...

782
01:22:11,378 --> 01:22:14,040
享有和臣子的新娘过夜的“初夜权”

783
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,178
我和Abby已经结婚三年了

你已经帮我一个忙了
You've already done me one favor, son.

786
01:22:35,936 --> 01:22:38,666
不要让这件事成为你的一个污点
Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.

787
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,372
我们都是斯文人
We'll be civilized about this.

788
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:53,643
我希望你能祝福我
l want you to give me your blessing.

789

先生，我做不到

790
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,092
你做不到？
You can't?

我们曾有个伟大的国家

我知道它为什么能伟大

795
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:26,883
因为“我做得到”

796
01:23:27,988 --> 01:23:29,250
直到弱智们来了
Till the weak came along.

797
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,020
“我做不到”破坏了我们

798
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:36,995
我现在就要让我们重新强大起来

我要成为一个新国家的...

800
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:41,166
...国父
...of a new nation.

801
01:23:42,168 --> 01:23:43,658
你知不知道为什么...
And do you know why...

802
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,428
...会是我呢？
...it will be me?

803
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,706
因为“我做得到”
Because l can.

804
01:24:01,588 --> 01:24:02,850
快住手
Stop it!

求你了让我过去吧

帮帮他啊，谁能帮帮他啊
Help him, somebody! Please!

809
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:33,850
你大可不必--
You didn't have to--!

810
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:36,312
不必什么？
Didn't have to what?

811
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:40,858
你个混蛋！
You bastard!

812

ldiots!

859
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,370
你都在想些什么？！
What're you thinking?!

860
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,478
《罗马书》上...
The Romans...

861
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:57,412
有句话...

常被用来吓唬小孩子

863
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,252
“Hannibal...
''Hannibal...

865
01:29:07,393 --> 01:29:08,758
Hannibal...

866
01:29:09,629 --> 01:29:11,654
...就在门口
...is at the gates.

867
01:29:18,805 --> 01:29:20,670
你知道Hannibal是谁吗?
Do you know who Hannibal was?

868
01:29:22,675 --> 01:29:23,835
当然不知道
Of course not.

869
01:29:24,043 --> 01:29:26,944
像你这么漂亮的女孩当然不会明白这种事情了
A pretty girl like you wouldn't understand something like that.

870
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:34,045
-让我们和他们打吧！ -用什么打？
-Let's fight them! -With what?

871
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:37,518
我们有五把枪 却一发子弹也没有
We've got 5 guns, maybe 0 rounds of ammo.

872
01:29:37,724 --> 01:29:39,487
就这些武器我们怎么和他们打？
How we going to fight with that?

873
01:29:39,692 --> 01:29:40,852
你们不要打
You don't.

874
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:46,229
和他们谈判吧
Negotiate a settlement.

875
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,196
给他们些额外的补给
Give them extra supplies.

876
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:56,466
告诉他们，你是政府的代表

就在这里

878
01:30:23,302 --> 01:30:26,066
快点 我还有个攻击计划要制定
Make it quick. l've got an attack to coordinate.

879

881
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,334
我不这样认为，先生
l don't think so, sir.

882
01:30:38,112 --> 01:30:39,704
你就是邮差
You're the postman.

883
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:41,112
是吗?
Aren't you?

884
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:45,743
进去!
lnside!

885
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:51,919
美国的信
''U.S. Mail.''

886
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,961
重建后的美国
''The Restored United States of America.''

887
01:30:56,597 --> 01:30:59,532
这里的人真的相信这些狗屎?!
Do these people really believe that shit?!

888
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,994
说真的，你到底是谁?
Who are you, really?

889
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,698
我是一个美国的邮差...
l'm a United States postman...

890
01:31:06,073 --> 01:31:09,634
...通过重建的国会第417号命令授权
...authorized by Order 4 1 7 of the Restored Congress.

891
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:13,974
我参加了Georgetown战役 我亲眼目睹白宫被夷为平地
l was at the Battle of Georgetown. l watched the White House burn down.

892
01:31:14,181 --> 01:31:16,206
你别想让我...
Do not try to sell me...

893
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,783
...相信那所谓的重建的美国!

896
01:31:27,795 --> 01:31:30,320
你知道过去的维京人在什么地方玩耍吗?
You know where the Vikings used to play?

897
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,865
你在开玩笑吧
You're funny.

898
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,135
条件是什么?
What are the terms?

899
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:44,939
他们将打开大门, 给与平常双倍的物资...
They'll open the gates, give double the usual...

900
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:46,309

901
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,845
...不要伤害任何人
...don't hurt anybody.

902
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:49,776
这一切只是一个误会
This was all a misunderstanding.

903
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,818
我赞赏你的提议,邮差先生
l appreciate your offer, Mr. Postman.

904
01:32:00,027 --> 01:32:03,656
但事实是你根本没有资格来讨价还价
But the fact is that you're in no position to negotiate.

905
01:32:04,165 --> 01:32:07,657
这里的人造成了疯狂和暴乱...
These people made it through the bugs and the riots...

906
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:11,735

...and the 3-year winters, but they're not going to survive you.

907
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,038

Fire at will!

908
01:32:24,618 --> 01:32:25,983
法律第六条:

909
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:28,280
法律就是...

...命令!

911
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:36,656
杀了他, 把重建的美国和他一起杀了
lKill him, and kill the Restored United States with him.

912
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,748
根据法律第8条...

917
01:34:30,711 --> 01:34:32,736
我们现在不能停
We can't stop now.

918
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:36,510
你怎么了?
What are you...?

919
01:34:39,553 --> 01:34:40,815
噢，上帝呀!
Oh, God!

920
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,354
趴下
Come on down.

921
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:26,906
别动
Don't move.

922
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:35,850
如果你有子弹,你早开枪了
lf you had a bullet, you'd use it.

923
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,757
快走
Come on.

924
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:48,048
我想我很久没喝过汤了
l don't think l ever had water soup before.

925
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:52,255
也许下次我们应该试着放点盐
Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand.

926
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,022
泥土
Dirt.

927
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,494
也许只是一点佐料
Maybe a twig garnish.

928
01:38:04,537 --> 01:38:06,528
你总是认为我很好笑
You used to think l was funny.

929
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:12,204
他们杀了Michael
They killed Michael.

930
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:22,688
我很难过
l'm sorry.

931
01:38:26,993 --> 01:38:28,255
你难过什么?
How sorry are you?

932
01:38:29,729 --> 01:38:30,753
什么?
What?

933
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:37,894
你这样问什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

934
01:38:40,907 --> 01:38:41,703
你怎么了?
What's with you?

935
01:38:41,908 --> 01:38:44,035
你身上有个8的印记
You have the mark of 8 on you.

936
01:38:45,912 --> 01:38:46,879
印记并不表示--
Mark doesn't mean--

937
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:48,740
你是个骗子
You're a liar.

938
01:38:51,818 --> 01:38:52,910
你和Bethlehem在一起
You were with Bethlehem.

939
01:38:53,953 --> 01:38:56,046
你也是他们的一分子?
Does that make you one of them?

940
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,127
别逼我用这个
Don't make me use this.

941
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:26,709
起风了
Wind's come up.

942
01:39:27,053 --> 01:39:28,315
越来越冷了
It's getting colder too.

943
01:39:29,222 --> 01:39:31,656
另一场暴风就要来了
Must be another storm.

944
01:39:35,328 --> 01:39:36,761
还要什么?
Anything else?

945
01:39:38,464 --> 01:39:40,432
我不是说要你....
l didn't mean for you to....

946
01:39:40,633 --> 01:39:44,228
你再不下床走动你的腿就要烂掉
Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.

947
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,333
-我受伤了 -你懒惰!
-l'm hurt. -You're lazy!

948
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:47,699
懒惰?
Lazy?

949
01:39:47,974 --> 01:39:50,204
我的胃上穿了一个洞...
l got a hole in my stomach...

950
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:51,933
...而且我很虚弱
...and l'm weak.

951
01:39:52,144 --> 01:39:55,739
这周围只有雪和草...
The  big meals around here are snow and grass...

952
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,007
...而且我们的草就要用完了
...and we're running out of grass.

953
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,357
你要干什么?
What're you doing?

954
01:40:36,622 --> 01:40:37,816
把早餐给我吧!
Give me a break!

955
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:41,656
我去检查一下关口
l'm going to check the pass.

956
01:40:43,563 --> 01:40:45,190
你为什么这么着急?
Why are you in such a hurry?

957
01:40:45,398 --> 01:40:47,696
我们可以考虑一下更糟的地方
l could think of worse places.

958
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:50,896
或者更糟的军队
Or l could think of worse company.

959
01:40:58,277 --> 01:40:59,608
好极了!
Perfect!

960
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:58,829
救命!

961

962

963
01:42:13,552 --> 01:42:14,519
快来呀!
Quick!

964
01:42:25,665 --> 01:42:27,257
上帝呀, 救救我!
God, help me!

965
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,110
我告诉你了我没事
l told you that's all there was.

966
01:42:50,389 --> 01:42:52,448
正因为如此你该吃了它
That's why you should have it.

967
01:42:57,863 --> 01:42:59,694
我知道你能走
l knew you could walk.

968
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:03,362
你真奇怪
You're weird.

969
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,168
你知道吗？?
lKnow that?

970
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,194
我曾经在月亮上走过, Abby
We walked on the moon once, Abby.

971
01:43:32,064 --> 01:43:33,497
真的?
So?

972
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,068
但现在有什么好?
What good is that now?

973
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:41,338
显然你忘记了...
Obviously you've forgotten...

974
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,905
...唐，和...
...Tang and...

975
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:45,201
...微波炉，还有....
...microwave ovens and....

976
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,242
你的脸看起来很可爱
Your face looks pretty.

977
01:43:58,157 --> 01:43:59,454
我的意思是...
l mean...

978
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:02,050
...如果没受伤
...not so bruised.

979
01:44:09,235 --> 01:44:10,463
其实...
Look...

980
01:44:11,103 --> 01:44:12,593
...有些事你应该知道
...there's something you'd better know.

981
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,567
你很快就能发现
You're going to find out soon enough.

982
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,840
我怀孕了
l'm pregnant.

983
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,638
是Michael的孩子
lt's Michael's baby.

984
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:27,145
但其实你才是真正的父亲
You're just the body father.

985
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:34,456
你怎么知道是我的...
How do you know it's mine...

986
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:37,926
...不是Bethlehem的?
...not Bethlehem's?

987
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,230
他每天晚上都和我在一起
He tried with me almost every night.

988
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,569
但是他不行...
He couldn't do it...

989
01:44:54,446 --> 01:44:56,073
...所以他打我
...so he beat me.

990
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:02,312
还说是我的错
Said it was my fault.

991
01:45:08,627 --> 01:45:09,594
对不起, Abby
l'm sorry, Abby.

992
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:50,666
怎么了?
What is it?

993
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:53,227
出什么事了?
What's wrong?

994
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,199
是孩子吗?
ls it the baby?

995
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,968
那个关口空了
The pass is clear.

996
01:46:22,234 --> 01:46:23,701
发生了什么事?
What happened?

997
01:46:26,105 --> 01:46:28,130
还好，你把我们的东西搬出来了
Good, you got our stuff out.

998
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,602
当然
Of course.

999
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:31,668
什么?
What?

1000

我不明白
l don't understand.

1001
01:46:36,148 --> 01:46:38,048
火是我放的
l set the fire.

1002
01:46:41,253 --> 01:46:43,346
难道你认为我们要永远呆在这里吗?
Did you think we'd stay here forever?

1003

Well, they say that you can never

Never go back home

1156
02:02:21,492 --> 02:02:23,653
And if you're bound to wander

1157
02:02:26,764 --> 02:02:28,732
You're bound to be alone

1158
02:02:33,605 --> 02:02:35,869
You say I got no right

1159
02:02:37,242 --> 02:02:39,437
To feel what I feel

1160
02:02:40,345 --> 02:02:42,438

跳个舞好吗?
Want to dance?

1162

Most every night

1164

Comes as no surprise

1165
02:02:58,463 --> 02:03:02,422
Well, I've been Out on this road for so long

1166

Far and wide

1167
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:08,901
Do I roam

1168
02:03:11,342 --> 02:03:15,210
But something in your smile tells me

1169
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:19,209
I'm almost home

1170
02:03:37,835 --> 02:03:39,359
I was lost in the dark

1171
02:03:39,804 --> 02:03:40,896
All alone

1172
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:44,140
Till the light

1173
02:03:44,342 --> 02:03:46,833

I was almost

1175
02:03:49,914 --> 02:03:51,939
Home is where the heart is

1176
02:03:53,418 --> 02:03:54,385
And my heart goes with you

1177
02:03:55,586 --> 02:03:57,747
I would travel till the end of time

1178
02:03:58,957 --> 02:04:01,391
If that's what I have to do

1179
02:04:02,126 --> 02:04:04,856
Just to spend one night

1180

02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:16,063
为什么？
Why?

1291
02:14:16,407 --> 02:14:17,704
我们得让Bethlehem知道 我们永不放弃
Bethlehem has to know we won't stop!

1292
02:14:18,142 --> 02:14:19,905
真是该死
Goddamn it, Ford!

1293
02:14:21,378 --> 02:14:23,846
那些人是因我们而死啊
Those people are dying because of us!

1294
02:14:24,048 --> 02:14:26,346
他们因为我们所做的才死的阿
They're dying because of what we did.

1295
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:29,075
不是的 他们是因为Bethlehem才死的
They're not! They're dying because of Bethlehem...

1296
02:14:29,286 --> 02:14:32,380
因为这是个狗屎世界 如果我们要想改变它
...because this is a shitty world! lf we're going to change it...

1297
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:34,251
就总会有人要牺牲
...then someone might have to die.

1298
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:37,222
如果我可以替他们在下面受死 我愿意，但我做不到
lf l could make it be me down there, l would, but l can't!

1299
02:14:40,631 --> 02:14:41,996
不要啊，求你们了
No! Please!

1300
02:14:44,435 --> 02:14:45,868
-你，滚开 -拦住她
-You, out here! -Hold her!

1301
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,435
求求你了
Please!

1302
02:15:04,521 --> 02:15:06,489
他就在某个地方
He's out there somewhere.

1303
02:15:08,258 --> 02:15:09,486
看着我们
Watching.

1304
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,726
我能感觉得到
l can feel it.

1305
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:18,932
你也感觉到了，不是吗？
You feel it too, don't you?

1306
02:15:20,537 --> 02:15:22,869
镇长，本来大可不必如此
lt didn't have to end like this, Sheriff!

1307
02:15:23,374 --> 02:15:27,174
他知道我在哪里 如果他是个男人他就会现身
He knew where l'd be if he wanted to face me like a man!

1308
02:15:27,945 --> 02:15:29,537
但他却像个兔子一样
lnstead he's hiding...

1309
02:15:29,747 --> 02:15:31,112
躲起来了
...like a rabbit!

1310
02:15:31,582 --> 02:15:33,573
你们的邮差也不过如此
So much for your Postman!

1311
02:15:34,385 --> 02:15:35,647
中尉！
Lieutenant!

1312
02:15:36,553 --> 02:15:37,485
有!
Ready!

1313
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:40,480
我们甚至不知道他们的名字
We don't even know their names.

1314
02:15:41,692 --> 02:15:43,387
我知道
We know their names.

1315
02:15:48,565 --> 02:15:49,554
那个就是我父亲
l think that's my dad.

1316
02:15:58,842 --> 02:15:59,968
瞄准！
Aim!

1317
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:02,108
继续前进阿，邮差！
Ride, Postman!

1318
02:16:02,713 --> 02:16:04,010
继续前进！
Ride!

1319
02:16:04,415 --> 02:16:05,609
你听见了吗？!
You hear me?!

1320
02:16:05,816 --> 02:16:07,681
我叫你们继续前进！
l said, ''Ride!''

1321
02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:09,982
射击！
Fire!

1322
02:16:33,744 --> 02:16:35,837
天哪，我都干了些什么啊！
My God, what have l done?

1323
02:16:38,882 --> 02:16:40,543
Ford所做的是错的
What Ford did was wrong!

1324
02:16:44,421 --> 02:16:46,514
但我们却没有采取任何的措施
But it doesn't change anything...

1325
02:16:46,724 --> 02:16:49,955
来进行补救，不是吗？
...for any of us, does it?

1326
02:17:12,783 --> 02:17:14,011
人都在这了？
ls this everybody?

1327
02:17:15,119 --> 02:17:16,552
其余的还在赶路
The rest are on the overdue list.

1328
02:17:18,055 --> 02:17:19,613
那就是都在这了
Then this is everybody.

1329
02:17:20,824 --> 02:17:22,951
有封来自总统的信
Got a letter from the President.

1330
02:17:25,395 --> 02:17:27,022
你们好，邮递员们！
''Greetings, all carriers.''

1331
02:17:27,231 --> 02:17:28,892
总统好！
Greetings, President Starkey!

1332
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:35,638
我一直都在和邮差保持联络
''l've been in contact with The Postman.

1333
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:37,670
我收到了所有的报告
And l've received all the reports.

1334
02:17:38,242 --> 02:17:39,903
我为你们自豪
l'm proud of you all.

1335
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:42,903
在暗无天日的日子里 在这个黑暗的世界里
ln dark days, in a weary world...

1336
02:17:43,113 --> 02:17:45,581
你们付出了所有，却一无所求
...you gave everything and asked for nothing.

1337
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:49,175
你们打退绝望，重拾希望
You beat back despair and replaced it with hope.

1338
02:17:49,953 --> 02:17:52,319
而你的国家却无法给你们任何回报
For that, your country can never repay you.

1339
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:54,747
但是付出的代价太大
But the price is too high...

1340
02:17:56,493 --> 02:17:59,656
而我也不想再看到我的勇士们有任何的牺牲
...and l won't see any more of my bravest die.

1341
02:18:01,231 --> 02:18:03,791
职责所在，我将要解散...
lt is my duty to hereby disband...

1342
02:18:04,001 --> 02:18:07,437
重建的美国的邮政服务
...the Postal Service of the Restored United States.

1343
02:18:08,305 --> 02:18:10,398
请将你们的制服都烧掉...
You are to burn your uniforms...

1344
02:18:10,607 --> 02:18:14,099
而邮差也将立即返回Minneapolis
...and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once.

1345
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,311
谢谢
Thank you.

1346
02:18:16,947 --> 02:18:18,574
上帝保佑你们
And God bless you all.

1347
02:18:19,516 --> 02:18:20,710
总统敬上
The President.''

1348
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:40,665
总统从没写过这样的信
The President never wrote that letter.

1349
02:18:41,205 --> 02:18:43,469
如果他能写信的话 他就会这么写的
lf he could've, that's what he would have said.

1350
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,537
还有一封信是给谁的？
Who's the other letter to?

1351
02:18:45,742 --> 02:18:46,970
Bethlehem.
Bethlehem.

1352
02:18:47,477 --> 02:18:49,877
-我早上就把信送过去 -信上说什么？
-l'm taking it to him in the morning. -What's it say?

1353
02:18:50,447 --> 02:18:53,382
-内容保密，你知道这是规矩 -信上到底怎么说的？
-Mail's private, you know that. -What does it say?

1354
02:18:54,852 --> 02:18:56,581
信上说要结束了
lt says it's over.

1355
02:18:56,954 --> 02:18:58,683
就是说我们要放弃了
lt says we quit.

1356
02:18:59,857 --> 02:19:01,757
那是你放弃了
lt says you quit!

1357
02:19:02,392 --> 02:19:03,484
誓词是怎么说的？
What about the oath?

1358
02:19:03,694 --> 02:19:05,423
那你告诉我
Tell me something, Ford.

1359
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:08,621
一个死了的邮递员又能投递几封信呢
How much mail can a dead postman deliver?

1360
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:11,164
都结束了
lt's over.

1361
02:19:16,139 --> 02:19:17,401
那让我去送信
Then l'll take it.

1362
02:19:17,975 --> 02:19:19,374
我信不过你
l can't trust you.

1363
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:29,213
如果这就是结局...
lf this is the end...

1364
02:19:30,954 --> 02:19:34,014
如果这是最后一封投递的信
...if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered...

1365
02:19:36,627 --> 02:19:38,094
就让我来发吧
...l'll take it.

1366
02:19:40,063 --> 02:19:43,328
无论谁发这封信，都有可能会牺牲
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford, probably dies for it.

1367
02:19:43,767 --> 02:19:45,894
我仍然还是个邮差！
l'm still a postman!

1368
02:19:49,373 --> 02:19:50,237
你欠我的
You owe it to me.

1369
02:19:52,242 --> 02:19:53,072
我也欠我自己的
l owe it to me.

1370
02:20:08,926 --> 02:20:10,655
那不能怪Ford
It's not Ford's fault.

1371
02:20:11,194 --> 02:20:14,960
他和你不一样，他没有你的那些经历 他们都没有
He's not like you. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do.

1372
02:20:16,166 --> 02:20:17,793
这就是他们的全部了
This is all they have.

1373
02:20:18,669 --> 02:20:21,103
-这是他们知道的唯一神圣的事 -什么？
-lt's the only decent thing they know. -What?

1374
02:20:21,305 --> 02:20:22,704
做个邮差！
Being a postman?

1375
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:26,038
都是胡扯，Abby
lt's all bullshit, Abby.

1376
02:20:26,243 --> 02:20:27,403
全是胡扯
All of it.

1377
02:20:28,278 --> 02:20:31,213
我穿制服只是为了保暖
l took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm.

1378
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:34,414
我只是安慰他们而已
l made up the rest to stay fed.

1379
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:36,178
根本没有所谓的...
There is no...

1380
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:38,980
重建的美国
...Restored United States.

1381
02:20:39,923 --> 02:20:41,652
我觉得事情就是如此
l figured it was something like that.

1382
02:20:41,858 --> 02:20:43,826
我要去Saint Rose
l'm going to Saint Rose.

1383
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:45,858
我带你一起去
l'm taking you with me.

1384
02:20:46,697 --> 02:20:48,562
我已经帮你把马准备好了
l've already packed your horse.

1385
02:20:49,466 --> 02:20:51,593
我知道你不想听
l know you don't want to hear it...

1386
02:20:52,369 --> 02:20:54,667
但是你的腹中有我的孩子
...but that's my child inside you.

1387
02:20:55,539 --> 02:20:57,564
我想让他出生在一个安全的地方
l want to see it born somewhere safe.

1388
02:21:21,164 --> 02:21:22,995
我想我认出你来了
l thought l recognized you.

1389
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,994
Bethlehem将军说当我把枪指着你时 你应该跪倒在地
General Bethlehem said you should be on your knees when l do this.

1390
02:21:27,437 --> 02:21:29,337
我才不理那个混蛋说些什么
l don't give a damn what that asshole said.

1391
02:21:30,474 --> 02:21:32,169
将军是个了不起的人物
The general is a great man!

1392
02:21:36,747 --> 02:21:38,977
将军就他妈的是个疯子
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1393
02:21:44,354 --> 02:21:45,912
你想见识一下什么是男子汉？
You want to see a man?

1394
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,356
那就是
That's a man.

1395
02:21:52,529 --> 02:21:53,621
准备好没？
You ready?

1396
02:21:57,968 --> 02:21:59,128
好了
Yes.

1397
02:22:02,739 --> 02:22:05,037
你至少要比Bethlehem强些
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1398
02:22:06,109 --> 02:22:07,406
我看得出来
l've seen it.

1399
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:13,541
尊敬的Bethlehem
''To Bethlehem.

1400
02:22:14,518 --> 02:22:16,486
这是我的真心话
This letter is my testimony...

1401
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,520
事实上并没有
...to the fact that there is no...

1402
02:22:19,723 --> 02:22:21,884
重建后的美国
...Restored United States...

1403
02:22:22,192 --> 02:22:24,387
也没有什么邮政服务
...and there is no postal service.''

1404
02:22:26,029 --> 02:22:27,496
他想让我相信这个？
He expects me to believe this?

1405
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:28,627
这是真的
lt's true.

1406
02:22:33,136 --> 02:22:35,331
我当时就在那 他解散了邮递员组织
l was there. He disbanded the carriers...

1407
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,073
然后向西边走了
...and rode west.

1408
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:39,205
叛徒！
Traitor!

1409
02:22:42,145 --> 02:22:43,134
这么说我赢了
Then l've won.

1410
02:22:50,053 --> 02:22:52,487
把我们昨天抓到的那个人带过来 把他们一起处死
Bring the one we found yesterday. They can die together.

1411
02:22:53,757 --> 02:22:55,088
叛徒！ 你这个叛徒！
You traitor! You're a traitor!

1412
02:23:02,299 --> 02:23:04,358
那个人是那边的二号人物
That one's the second-in-command.

1413
02:23:04,568 --> 02:23:06,763
怎么没让我感到惊喜呢？
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1414
02:23:10,273 --> 02:23:11,763
我在想，长官...
l was thinking, sir...

1415
02:23:13,343 --> 02:23:16,335
对我们来说把他关起来也许更有价值
...he might be more valuable to us as a prisoner.

1416
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:19,640
本打算让你干掉他的
You were supposed to kill him...

1417
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:20,976
对吗？
...weren't you?

1418
02:23:22,385 --> 02:23:24,216
但是我没办法靠近他
l couldn't get close enough.

1419
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,500
你是谁？
Who are you?

1420
02:23:47,544 --> 02:23:49,171
我叫Clark
My name's Clark.

1421
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:52,212
重建后的加州邮递员
Postal Carrier for the Restored Republic of California.

1422
02:23:52,816 --> 02:23:53,874
你又是谁？
Who are you?

1423
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:02,615
邮局局长，Ford
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1424
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:12,530
万分荣幸！
lt's an honor.

1425
02:24:16,106 --> 02:24:16,970
等一等
Wait!

1426
02:24:19,176 --> 02:24:21,303
等一等，先别开火
Wait a minute. Hold your fire.

1427
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:27,940
你们俩并不认识？
You two don't know each other?

1428
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:38,488
这将不会结束
This'll never be over.

1429
02:24:39,095 --> 02:24:40,585
会一直持续下去
lt'll go on.

1430
02:24:42,165 --> 02:24:44,690
除非我是在和一个该死的鬼魂在战斗
Except l'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.

1431
02:24:45,669 --> 02:24:48,229
-可以开枪了吗？ -别开枪，该死的
-Should we fire, sir? -No, goddamn it!

1432
02:24:49,706 --> 02:24:51,435
我不会和鬼魂打仗
l won't fight a ghost.

1433
02:24:53,977 --> 02:24:55,308
Tabula...
Tabula...

1434
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:57,276
...rasa...
...rasa...

1435
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,742
...先生们
...gentlemen.

1436
02:24:59,716 --> 02:25:01,616
一段清白的历史
A clean slate.

1437
02:25:02,552 --> 02:25:05,544
我要对所有的邮递员穷追猛打
l want all mail carriers hunted down.

1438
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:08,823
我一定要找到那个邮差
l want The Postman found.

1439
02:25:09,025 --> 02:25:10,959
我要狠狠地打击他
l want him dealt with.

1440
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:13,556
上校，集合部队
Colonel, organize the scouts.

1441
02:25:15,365 --> 02:25:16,559
你说他往西走了？
You said he rode west?

1442
02:25:22,038 --> 02:25:23,903
而这是他的二号人物？
And this is his second-in-command?

1443
02:25:27,978 --> 02:25:29,138
是的，长官
Yes, sir!

1444
02:25:42,425 --> 02:25:45,690
我会留你一条命用来谈判 要让邮差投鼠忌器
l'll keep you to bargain with. The Postman is weak that way.

1445
02:26:36,279 --> 02:26:38,213
把枪扔到地上
Set your rifle on the ground!

1446
02:26:38,982 --> 02:26:40,882
扔到地上
Set it on the ground.

1447
02:26:42,485 --> 02:26:44,612
什么？这个破玩意？
What? This old thing?

1448
02:26:46,256 --> 02:26:47,382
子弹都没上上去呢
lt isn't even loaded.

1449
02:26:48,725 --> 02:26:50,215
我们这是在哪里？
Where are we?

1450
02:26:51,294 --> 02:26:53,262
你们在大桥城
You're in Bridge City...

1451
02:26:55,198 --> 02:26:57,223
而这里不允许枪支
...where we don't allow guns.

1452
02:27:07,777 --> 02:27:09,506
岗哨说你要来了
The sentry said you were coming.

1453
02:27:17,554 --> 02:27:19,488
我知道你，你...
l know you. You're...

1454
02:27:20,056 --> 02:27:20,852
...很出名
...famous.

1455
02:27:22,625 --> 02:27:24,058
曾经是...
l was once...

1456
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,522
...有那么...
...sort of...

1457
02:27:25,729 --> 02:27:26,991
一点点
...kind of.

1458
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,696
不再是了
Not anymore.

1459
02:27:29,632 --> 02:27:30,428
你们要穿过去？
Looking to cross?

1460
02:27:31,334 --> 02:27:32,562
是的
We will be.

1461
02:27:33,503 --> 02:27:36,438
但现在我们想要一些吃的
Right now we'd appreciate some food.

1462
02:27:38,208 --> 02:27:39,505
没问题
Okay.

1463
02:27:40,443 --> 02:27:41,910
在我们后面，还有几个孩子
There are some kids behind us.

1464
02:27:42,112 --> 02:27:43,079
几个？
How many?

1465
02:27:43,279 --> 02:27:44,109
3个
3.

1466
02:27:45,014 --> 02:27:46,845
3个，好吧
3. Okay.

1467
02:27:49,886 --> 02:27:51,547
进来吧，孩子们
Come on in, guys!

1468
02:27:53,923 --> 02:27:55,982
我知道你们就在那
l know you're out there.

1469
02:29:07,831 --> 02:29:10,061
-等等，等一等 -他想要什么？
-Wait. Just wait. -What did he want?

1470
02:29:11,835 --> 02:29:13,632
请安静，他说...
Hold on. He says...

1471
02:29:13,837 --> 02:29:16,032
...他在寻找邮差
...he's looking for The Postman.

1472
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:18,598
再没有这样一回事了
There's no such thing anymore.

1473
02:29:22,312 --> 02:29:25,145
但那个骑马的人说有这么一回事
The man on the horse says there is.

1474
02:29:25,682 --> 02:29:27,513
他认为邮差就在这里
He thinks he's here.

1475
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:30,078
而他会带着他的同伙再回来
And he's coming back with friends.

1476
02:29:35,492 --> 02:29:37,426
邮差时干吗的？
What's a postman?

1477
02:29:55,278 --> 02:29:56,643
你从来没听说过邮差？
You never heard of a postman?

1478
02:30:34,317 --> 02:30:35,443
你就是那个邮差？
Are you The Postman?

1479
02:30:41,224 --> 02:30:42,248
对
Yeah.

1480
02:30:43,726 --> 02:30:45,455
伙计，我听说过你啊
l heard of you, man.

1481
02:30:46,362 --> 02:30:47,795
你很出名
You're famous.

1482
02:30:49,766 --> 02:30:51,495
也许，是吧
Yeah, l guess l am.

1483
02:30:53,202 --> 02:30:54,931
但突然之间 我已经...
And all of a sudden, l'm not...

1484
02:30:55,438 --> 02:30:57,406
...不再是个邮差了
...wearing the right clothes.

1485
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:14,185
伙计，你会喜欢上这玩意的
Man, you're going to love this!

1486
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:17,287
打开第二道瀑布
Open that second chute, bro!

1487
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:36,174
邮差先生，你很有天赋
You have a gift, Postman.

1488
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:40,180
在Pineview，我看见它又回来了
l saw it back in Pineview.

1489
02:31:42,652 --> 02:31:45,519
你给了我们都已经遗忘了的宝贵财富
You've given us all back what we'd forgotten.

1490
02:31:47,423 --> 02:31:50,449
你让March觉得她仿佛重见光明
You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again.

1491
02:31:52,195 --> 02:31:55,790
你让Ford觉得他就是这个世界的一分子
You made Ford feel like he was part of the world.

1492
02:31:58,735 --> 02:32:01,169
你给了我们希望...
You give out hope like it was...

1493
02:32:01,371 --> 02:32:03,339
...就像点亮你口袋里的蜡烛
...candy in your pocket.

1494
02:32:19,455 --> 02:32:20,820
你还记得这个吗？
Remember this?

1495
02:32:22,558 --> 02:32:23,957
我记得
l remember.

1496
02:32:25,561 --> 02:32:28,428
我常想，你是故意把这个留给我的
l always like to think that you left it on purpose.

1497
02:32:34,103 --> 02:32:36,128
这对我来说很不容易
This is hard for me.

1498
02:32:40,576 --> 02:32:43,670
Michael是我见过的最好的男人
Michael was the best man l ever knew.

1499
02:32:46,382 --> 02:32:49,977
我从来没想过 我会像爱他那样去爱另外一个人
l never thought there'd be another man l could love the way l loved him.

1500
02:32:53,856 --> 02:32:56,518
我没法看得那么远
l couldn't see it for so long.

1501
02:32:59,162 --> 02:33:00,993
而你现在就要离开
And now you're leaving.

1502
02:33:05,501 --> 02:33:06,627
我害怕
And l'm afraid.

1503
02:33:10,206 --> 02:33:12,766
我害怕你再也找不到你的Saint Rose
l'm afraid you'll never find your Saint Rose.

1504
02:33:13,543 --> 02:33:14,407
这不重要
lt's not important.

1505
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:17,340
我害怕你再也看不到你的小孩
l'm afraid you'll never see your baby.

1506
02:33:45,575 --> 02:33:49,409
我需要充足的电源！ 这个家伙要走很远的路呢！
l need full power, man! This dude's got a long way to go!

1507
02:33:54,317 --> 02:33:56,376
这机器运转得真他妈的完美
This thing's working perfect, man!

1508
02:34:08,331 --> 02:34:10,356
比看起来还要高很多，不是吗？
A lot higher than it looks, huh?

1509
02:34:20,409 --> 02:34:21,842
你差点就报销了
You nearly went.

1510
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:25,339
快进来吧
Get in.

1511
02:34:27,016 --> 02:34:29,644
在前面有三个规模很大的镇子
There's 3 good-sized towns up ahead...

1512
02:34:29,852 --> 02:34:33,447
如果你能说服他们跟你走 你就能找到足够的帮手
...with enough people to help you if you can convince them to come.

1513
02:34:36,993 --> 02:34:38,756
不要告诉任何人
Don't tell anybody...

1514
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:42,226
说我喜欢玩这玩意，仅仅因为它好玩
...l like to ride this damn thing just for the hell of it.

1515
02:34:42,431 --> 02:34:45,696
你知道，作为一个领导 我得注意自身形象
Being a city official has its perks, you know?

1516
02:34:53,709 --> 02:34:57,440
相信我吧，伙计 这会让你更快的
Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster.

1517
02:35:03,052 --> 02:35:04,246
我怎么停下来呢？
How do l stop?

1518
02:35:04,754 --> 02:35:07,018
别再这里婆婆妈妈了
Quit worrying about the little things.

1519
02:35:07,223 --> 02:35:09,214
祝你好运，跑得飞快！
Good luck, and Godspeed.

1520
02:35:25,408 --> 02:35:27,467
长官，我向您报告！
Reporting for duty, sir!

1521
02:35:27,677 --> 02:35:29,304
-知道该怎么做吗？ -去说服人们
-Know what to do? -Talk to the people.

1522
02:35:29,846 --> 02:35:31,211
告诉他们这很重要
Tell them it's important.

1523
02:35:31,414 --> 02:35:32,745
告诉他们我们可以做到
Tell them we can make a difference.

1524
02:35:33,816 --> 02:35:37,308
再向前冲，亲爱的朋友们 再向前冲
''Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...

1525
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,852
...或者以死守卫我们的城墙
...or close the wall with our dead!

1526
02:35:40,223 --> 02:35:44,250
在和平时期，我们要谦虚彬彬有礼
In peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility.

1527
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:47,258
但是一旦爆发战争
But when the blast of war blows in our ears...

1528
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:49,590
我们就要像头猛虎一样勇猛
...then imitate the action of the tiger.

1529
02:35:49,799 --> 02:35:54,099
鼓起我们的勇气 收起我们温和的本性...
Summon up the blood. Disguise fair nature with rage...

1530
02:35:54,303 --> 02:35:57,466
去和敌人拼个你死我活
...and lend the eye a terrible aspect. ''

1531
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,440
-他们是谁？ -不知道
-Who are they? -l don't know.

1532
02:36:42,652 --> 02:36:45,780
在我看来大部分都是老弱病残
Looks like mostly women and young people to me.

1533
02:36:45,988 --> 02:36:47,114
有多少？
How many?

1534
02:36:47,556 --> 02:36:48,818
那是一支军队
lt's an army.

1535
02:36:59,635 --> 02:37:01,125
终于...
At last...

1536
02:37:01,437 --> 02:37:04,998
还是有人鼓起用来和我作战了
...someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.

1537
02:37:09,512 --> 02:37:11,002
先生们，算总账的时候到了
Reckoning, gentlemen!

1538
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:06,930
他们看起来热血沸腾
They're an eager-looking bunch!

1539
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:37,594
士气真的是很重要
Morale is a dangerous thing.

1540
02:38:39,568 --> 02:38:41,399
把俘虏带上来
Bring up the prisoner!

1541
02:38:42,038 --> 02:38:43,938
让我们来告诉他们 游戏该怎么来玩
We'll show them how this game is played.

1542
02:39:26,415 --> 02:39:27,712
呆在这
Stay here.

1543
02:39:42,298 --> 02:39:43,322
他在投降？
ls he surrendering?

1544
02:39:43,799 --> 02:39:45,528
该死，我不希望这样
God, l hope not.

1545
02:40:07,423 --> 02:40:09,050
小小搬运工
My little shipping clerk.

1546
02:40:09,658 --> 02:40:11,489
卖复印机的销售员
Mr. copy-machine salesman.

1547
02:40:12,761 --> 02:40:14,592
我们俩是一对大骗子
We're both a couple of frauds.

1548
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:18,161
说的没错
So be it.

1549
02:40:19,535 --> 02:40:23,096
但是一个伟人是由另一个伟人来成就的
But great men are made by other great men.

1550
02:40:23,706 --> 02:40:24,968
Rommel成就了Patton
Patton had Rommel.

1551
02:40:25,574 --> 02:40:27,599
Lee成就了Grant
Grant had Lee.

1552
02:40:28,344 --> 02:40:29,311
而你将会成就我的霸业
But l get you.

1553
02:40:30,045 --> 02:40:31,478
你不是将军
You're no general.

1554
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:33,980
你甚至也不是一个好的画家
You're not even a good painter.

1555
02:40:36,452 --> 02:40:38,044
你想要激将我？
Trying to goad me into a fight?

1556
02:40:38,254 --> 02:40:41,951
如果战争由发起它的人来结束，就非常完美
lt'd be great if wars were fought just by the assholes who started them.

1557
02:40:43,792 --> 02:40:45,282
我们可以对这场战争作个了结
We could settle this right here...

1558
02:40:46,529 --> 02:40:47,791
只有你跟我
...you and me.

1559
02:40:49,798 --> 02:40:51,857
不幸的是，这种方法行不通
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

1560
02:40:52,067 --> 02:40:53,830
但是在你的部队里却可以
But it does in your army.

1561
02:40:54,803 --> 02:40:56,828
我引用八大法律中的...
l invoke Law Seven...

1562
02:40:57,506 --> 02:40:58,598
...第七条
...of the Laws of Eight!

1563
02:41:00,643 --> 02:41:04,602
在部队里谁都可以挑战老大的位子
''Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!''

1564
02:41:04,813 --> 02:41:05,643
我向你挑战
l challenge you.

1565
02:41:05,848 --> 02:41:10,148
你不是我们一伙的，你没有这个权力
You're not a Holnist. You're not a member. You don't have the right.

1566
02:41:10,352 --> 02:41:12,149
我拥有所有的权力
l have every right!

1567
02:41:18,093 --> 02:41:19,458
我引用第七条法律
l invoke Law Seven.

1568
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,828
你去哪...?

我要挑战...

...老大的位子

1571
02:41:48,657 --> 02:41:50,284
我在哪里见过你？
Where do l know you from?

1572
02:41:51,093 --> 02:41:52,651
你下令抢劫...

1573
02:41:53,062 --> 02:41:55,155
...然后喂养这些战争走狗
...and let slip the dogs of war!''

1574
02:41:56,332 --> 02:41:57,458
你还记得那些吗？
You remember that?

1575
02:41:59,935 --> 02:42:01,300
莎士比亚
Shakespeare.

1576
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:04,301
那个不想打仗的人
The one who didn't want to fight.

1577
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:08,535
那时我就应该设法杀死你 但你看起来太强大
l should have found a way to kill you then, but you seemed so strong.

1578
02:42:10,279 --> 02:42:11,507
第七条法律...
Law Seven...

1579
02:42:12,848 --> 02:42:14,008
...那就是

1580
02:42:15,117 --> 02:42:17,051
这场战争将在这里作个了结
This war is settled here!

1581
02:43:44,139 --> 02:43:45,800
我研究过人们
l studied people.

1582
02:43:47,276 --> 02:43:49,210
我知道你的问题在哪
l know your problem.

1583
02:43:49,878 --> 02:43:51,140
你知道...
Do you know...

1584
02:43:51,347 --> 02:43:53,372
为什么你不能打吗？
...why you can't fight?

1585
02:43:55,584 --> 02:43:58,815
因为你不知道为何而战
Because you have nothing to fight for.

1586
02:44:01,523 --> 02:44:03,491
你什么也不关心

1587
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:07,222
你什么也不在乎

1588
02:44:07,696 --> 02:44:10,426
你对什么都不信任
You don't believe in anything!

1589
02:44:10,632 --> 02:44:12,759
而那些却让我变得更厉害
And that's what makes me better.

1590
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:16,469
我信任...

...美国
...in the United States.

1592
02:44:58,947 --> 02:45:01,882
我们本可以不这样的
lt doesn't have to be this way.

1593
02:45:02,818 --> 02:45:05,048
我们本可以不用互相残杀
We don't have to kill each other.

1594
02:45:07,423 --> 02:45:08,981
第三条法律...

1596

02:45:19,835 --> 02:45:22,030
...而那就是死

1601
02:45:27,843 --> 02:45:29,367
他不值得的
He isn't worth it.

1602
02:45:33,115 --> 02:45:35,140
现在我是部队的头儿

1603
02:45:37,352 --> 02:45:39,081
将会产生新的法律

我们将拥有和平

1607
02:46:06,081 --> 02:46:08,072
你觉得这样如何？
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury?

1608
02:46:14,423 --> 02:46:15,754
Ford，要像个领袖的样子

1612
02:47:53,121 --> 02:47:55,021
你爸爸写信来说
Your daddy wrote to tell you...

1613
02:47:55,223 --> 02:47:57,919
他会尽快赶回来的

1614

他非常爱你

1615
02:48:08,637 --> 02:48:10,070
信件太慢了
Mail's slow.

1616
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:13,631
我打算亲自来告诉她

1617
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:47,531
你的女儿
Your daughter.

1618
02:48:49,711 --> 02:48:51,770
她的名字叫希望
Her name is Hope.

1619
02:49:22,577 --> 02:49:24,841
我父亲看到我们是如此的脆弱...
My father saw how fragile we are...

1620
02:49:25,047 --> 02:49:28,483
...如此轻易的就落入暴君的统治

1621

他发现普通人...

1622
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:34,719
...也可以有潜力可挖，可以找到勇气

他发现如果我们作为一个国家来沟通...

...我们就可以再一次强大起来

1625
02:49:41,063 --> 02:49:42,325
团结起来

1626
02:49:43,065 --> 02:49:45,431
但是他从来没有真正见到过Saint Rose
But he never did see Saint Rose.

1627
02:49:47,002 --> 02:49:48,333
他说...

1628
02:49:49,004 --> 02:49:50,995
...还有太多的事情要去做
...there was too much to be done.

1629
02:49:52,641 --> 02:49:54,131
他许下承诺
He'd made a promise.

1630
02:49:54,676 --> 02:49:57,804
他信守承诺 追逐一个又一个的梦想

1631
02:49:58,447 --> 02:50:00,005
无怨无悔

1632
02:50:03,552 --> 02:50:05,952
所以，为了向我的父亲表示敬意....

1633
02:50:44,793 --> 02:50:46,454
那个小孩是我
