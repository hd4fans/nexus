00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:13,988
WKCC AM Talk Radio. All talk, all the time.

2
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,597
Bringing you sports and weather on the five.

3
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:26,505
Church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially-motivated attacks...

4
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:29,679
...on a militia-like group calling themselves ''The Holnists. ''

5
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,347
One of the most radical and powerful of these groups...

6
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:36,018
...claims as its founder, the famed motivational speaker Nathan Holn.

7
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,898
The last of the great cities died...

8
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,737
...when my father was a child...

9
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,543
...victims of yet another war.

10
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:05,378
He told of the plagues that followed...

11
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:08,744
...and how the living hid themselves, scattered in tiny hamlets...

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,853
...in hopes of surviving whatever new madness...

13
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,856
...conspired to rob them of the little that remained.

14
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,821
In those days, he walked alone...

15
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,890
...a solitary witness to the chaos that reigned.

16
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,568
The earth itself had fallen victim to the insanity.

17
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:29,229
He told stories of the 3-year winter...

18
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:32,376
...and how the dirty snow never stopped falling.

19
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:36,745
He saw the ocean, barren, poisoned, near death.

20
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:40,247
And how they watched the sky for 1 6 long years...

21
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:43,510
...praying for the great lungs to start working again.

22
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:48,756
He said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief.

23
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,896
Many commuters are abandoning their vehicles.

24
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,459
Goddamn it, Bill!

25
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,095
You know l need to check it first.

26
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,848
l don't know.

27
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,187
Better than turpentine, Bill.

28
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:28,919
Tastes about the same.

29
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,189
What do you say?

30
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,729
Your call.

31
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,266
You ain't picky, Bill.

32
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,603
l like that about you.

33
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,708
Things l like about my ass...

34
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,040
...number 1 :

35
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,548
Will settle for turpentine.

36
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,554
We got TV!

37
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,168
We got 1 4 7 channels, Bill.

38
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,805
We got everything from...

39
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,566
...Jesus to Jeopardy .

40
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,636
''Like...

41
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,108
...sands through the hourglass, so are the days--.''

42
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,373
We'll watch that.

43
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,983
...sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.

44
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,414
''Monday.''

45
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:40,752
''Monday night.''

46
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,256
Monday-night football!

47
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,699
l don't want any trouble.

48
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,668
l bet you don't either.

49
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:01,602
Let's just call it a draw.

50
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,210
l'm rich!

51
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,345
l know the rule.

52
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,280
lt's my rule.

53
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,455
''Avoid civilization at all cost.''

54
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,789
We got to eat, don't we?

55
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:27,521
Open your mouth.

56
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,598
lt's true we haven't done this for awhile but...

57
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:36,365
...for God sakes, it's like riding a bicycle, Bill.

58
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,342
What are you so worried about?

59
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,876
All you got to do is stand there.

60
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,378
l'm the one with all the lines.

61
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,884
Open up.

62
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,020
Awful.

63
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,783
Just awful.

64
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:06,365
They said, ''Fear not, Macbeth...

65
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:08,999
...till Birnam Wood...

66
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,300
...comes to Dunsinane.''

67
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:21,083
l said...

68
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,647
'' ...till Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane!''

69
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,624
Thank you.

70
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,662
Arm yourselves!

71
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,776
Arm yourselves.

72
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,473
lf the witch's words are true...

73
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:54,446
...there'll be no running, hiding here!

74
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,852
They'll fight...

75
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,849
...as if our last meal depended on it.

76
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,603
Tomorrow....

77
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,200
And tomorrow....

78
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,537
Tomorrow.

79
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,102
And the day after that.

80
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,736
Out, brief candle!

81
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,513
Life's but a walking shadow...

82
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,380
...a poor player who struts...

83
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,248
...and frets his hour upon a stage...

84
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,252
...and is heard no more.

85
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,422
lt's a tale told by....

86
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,287
ldiot.

87
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,123
A moron...

88
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:43,562
...full of sound and fury...

89
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:45,994
...signifying...

90
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:48,700
...nothing.

91
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,582
But blow, wind!

92
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,082
Come, wrack!

93
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,220
At least we'll die...

94
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,581
...with the harness off our back!

95
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,693
l want to talk to him.

96
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:34,417
The children have never seen Shakespeare before.

97
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,878
They still haven't.

98
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,916
Thank you. You're very kind.

99
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:43,150
l'm clapping because you stink.

100
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:44,453
Larry!

101
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:46,527
l don't think you know how it works.

102
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,565
When l was young, l tried to be an actor. l was awful.

103
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:54,568
But now l won't die thinking l was the worst one.

104
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:55,966
-Stop it! -That's all right.

105
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,698
How much did you pay to get in?

106
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,368
So bite me.

107
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,505
You were very good.

108
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:09,349
-Good enough to get something to eat? -Yes, we have some soup.

109
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:25,165
Holnists. Goddamn!

110
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,767
Bastards hardly kill anyone lately.

111
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:35,641
We give them food and supplies.

112
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:37,606
All the towns do.

113
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:40,716
l'd just as soon not give them anything of mine, thanks.

114
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,649
What are you doing there?

115
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:28,960
What are you doing?

116
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,506
lt's just a game, General Bethlehem.

117
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,665
lt's something they saw in a play. No harm in it.

118
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:40,901
Wait a minute!

119
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,911
A play?

120
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:44,536
Show me.

121
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:50,844
lt's all right, children. Show me.

122
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:54,351
Arm yourselves.

123
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,253
No running from the witches.

124
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,923
Shakespeare, is it?

125
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,433
l'm sorry l missed it.

126
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:07,035
We haven't nearly stocked the game that we thought we would.

127
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,405
Really? But you had time for a play?

128
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,608
l'm taking 3 conscripts...

129
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,211
...from each town!

130
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:20,111
They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army...

131
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,046
...until such time as l see fit!

132
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,045
3 men.

133
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,218
Could you do that?

134
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:28,522
Captain!

135
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,792
All men...

136
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:34,021
...between 1 5 and 50...

137
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:38,861
...and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now!

138
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,634
General.

139
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,707
No, but keep that.

140
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,595
Acceptable.

141
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:12,791
Sir?

142
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:14,871
Acceptable, Captain.

143
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,640
Need some meat on you, but l like an impressionable mind.

144
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,205
Acceptable.

145
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:36,420
Mongoloid.

146
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,185
Unacceptable.

147
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:40,890
l want pure blood.

148
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,593
Someone....

149
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,432
Someone....

150
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,340
-Don't wave. -People, you will look at me!

151
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,139
Someone like....

152
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:06,850
Like that man!

153
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:21,030
You don't understand.

154
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,263
You were required to show yourself.

155
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:26,238
l'm not with them. l'm just passing through.

156
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,713
Take the mule.

157
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,577
Let's go! Move!

158
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:41,738
Ten-hut!

159
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:44,009
l want a line right here.

160
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,055
Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life.

161
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:04,325
You have been born again as soldiers in the United Army of Nathan Holn.

162
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:06,594
God rest his soul!

163
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,966
The strong have been sapped...

164
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,233
...by the whimpering propaganda of the weak.

165
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,270
Men...

166
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,873
...strong men, have been denied their destiny.

167
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,676
You men have been saved from that fate.

168
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,417
Redemption...

169
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,549
...is within your grasp.

170
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,289
You.

171
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,834
What did you do before you were given this opportunity?

172
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:41,735
l had a shovel. l digged holes.

173
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,700
You digged holes.

174
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:46,440
Now you'll fill them.

175
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,590
And you?

176
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:05,590
Me?

177
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,192
ls there any question in anyone's mind that l was speaking to you?

178
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,924
Yes, you.

179
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,027
l'm just a performer.

180
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,098
Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

181
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:18,772
Shakespeare?

182
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,609
He was a writer.

183
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:22,877
Yes, l know.

184
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,642
l know who Shakespeare was.

185
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,179
''Cry 'Havoc!' ...

186
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,819
...and let slip...

187
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,682
...the dogs of war.''

188
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,002
Me?

189
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,733
''To be or not to be:

190
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:53,567
That is the question.''

191
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,782
''We few...

192
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:09,253
...we happy few...

193
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,324
...we band of brothers!''

194
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,347
''Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer...

195
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,245
...by this sun of York.''

196
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:41,548
You're pretty good.

197
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,359
You're also a fighter. l can see it in your eyes.

198
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,662
You are a dangerous man.

199
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,430
Don't you agree?

200
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:02,305
No disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off letting me go.

201
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,885
A fighter is about the last thing that l am.

202
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,924
Don't you think l should be the judge of that, soldier?

203
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,891
Get up.

204
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,330
l said, get up!

205
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,281
You're right. You're not a fighter.

206
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,945
But you will be.

207
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:48,986
l'm giving you a chance at a life...

208
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:50,750
...that means something.

209
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,394
A life worth living.

210
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,090
-I'm glad to see you. -We missed you.

211
00:21:57,334 --> 00:22:00,303
-I missed you. Kurt, how are you? -Hungry.

212
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:05,269
-Gretl, what happened to your finger? -It got caught.

213
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:08,137
-Caught in what? -Friedrich's teeth.

214
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,353
Thanks.

215
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,395
Did l win?

216
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,068
l tried to tell him.

217
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,532
Say it again.

218
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:39,173
Say what?

219
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:42,068
Words you said in town.

220
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,339
About the wind blowing and the rest. Say it again.

221
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:49,115
''Blow, wind. Come, wrack.

222
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:53,053
At least we'll die with the harness off our back.''

223
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,257
What's it mean?

224
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:00,222
''Live free or...

225
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,454
...die.''

226
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:03,030
l think.

227
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:07,597
You're going to watch a movie or you can sleep!

228
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,133
But tomorrow...

229
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,932
...you run in uniform...

230
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,074
...full packs...

231
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,267
...20 miles!

232
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:17,345
Everybody makes it...

233
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:18,809
...or nobody eats...

234
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,143
...for the third day in a row!

235
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:19,165
Everybody up.

236
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,241
You got meat tonight.

237
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,749
Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind it is?

238
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,053
Mule.

239
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,128
God-awful animal.

240
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:44,527
Sterile offspring of horse and donkey.

241
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,264
Can you imagine that?

242
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,302
There's no room in the New World for a bastard like that.

243
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:06,989
Any man last in line ain't hungry enough to eat.

244
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,129
You show up last...

245
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:19,927
...you don't eat!

246
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,708
l'm going to die before l'm last in line again!

247
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:34,042
That's what they're hoping for.

248
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,853
Shut up! At least you're eating!

249
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,828
You serious?

250
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:57,334
Good.

251
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:00,673
This is good!

252
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,735
You want this?!

253
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:39,343
This is what you want?

254
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:52,326
Babies!

255
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,267
The hills are alive

256
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,271
With the sound of music

257
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:15,046
These were supposed to be the best years of my life.

258
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,762
The Laws of Eight, gentlemen.

259
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:30,865
That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.

260
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,056
May he burn in hell.

261
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:34,835
These are the laws that we live by.

262
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:36,435
The 8...

263
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,134
...is our symbol.

264
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:42,309
Each man will bear it with pride.

265
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,447
Only then will you be part of the clan.

266
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,480
Sit down, gentlemen.

267
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,764
Law One:

268
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:12,600
You will obey orders without question. l told you to sit.

269
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,202
There weren't enough chairs.

270
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:20,645
l didn't specify chairs. You could've sat on the ground.

271
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:24,710
You disobeyed a direct order. You broke...

272
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:26,081
...Law One.

273
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:27,820
Law Two:

274
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:29,992
Punishment shall be swift.

275
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,429
Law Three:

276
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,797
Mercy...

277
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,865
...is for the weak.

278
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,130
Four:

279
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:45,469
Terror...

280
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,177
...will defeat reason.

281
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:50,877
Five:

282
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:54,213
Your allegiance is to the clan.

283
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:56,976
Six:

284
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,286
Justice can be dictated.

285
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,190
Seven:

286
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,962
Any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan.

287
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,460
Does anyone wish to challenge me?

288
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:14,733
On your feet.

289
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,202
Law Eight:

290
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:25,245
There's only one penalty. Death.

291
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,006
Please! l'm begging you!

292
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,801
You will get out of this army what you put into it.

293
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,665
Work and you'll be fed.

294
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,373
Fight and you'll be respected.

295
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,278
Die and you'll be remembered.

296
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,961
You thinking of challenging for leadership?

297
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,786
No, sir.

298
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,625
l'm a follower...

299
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,433
...not a leader.

300
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,159
You got a smart mouth...

301
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,564
...Shakespeare.

302
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,964
You see Colonel Getty always following the General?

303
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,100
He was the last man ever to challenge.

304
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,972
Fight lasted 6 seconds...

305
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:33,382
...but he didn't kill him.

306
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,475
Cut off his tongue...

307
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:38,051
...then he cut off his balls.

308
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:42,952
And old Getty's been following him around like a dog ever since.

309
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:45,318
Fall out!

310
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,397
The General don't see it...

311
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,998
...but l say you've got some nigger in you.

312
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,753
They're yours?

313
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,532
A solitary man, aren't you?

314
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,995
Binoculars to watch life from a distance and Shakespeare...

315
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,502
...to read about it, instead of living it.

316
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:34,340
No offense, but you seem to have read Shakespeare...

317
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,636
...yourself.

318
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:41,248
lf he wishes to rise above mere thuggery...

319
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,648
...a military commander must be classically educated...

320
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:48,119
...philosophy and history, even a sense of the dramatic.

321
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:54,354
What do you think that l did before the war?

322
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:57,028
Do you think that l was in the army?

323
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,898
l sold copying machines.

324
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:01,668
l was a salesman...

325
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,630
...with the talent to lead men, devise and execute a battle plan...

326
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,435
...locked away inside.

327
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:12,911
lf Nathan Holn hadn't come along, l'd still be selling copying machines.

328
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,409
Can you imagine...

329
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:19,145
...the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of that?

330
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:21,484
But war...

331
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,692
...war gives men like me a chance.

332
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,287
Here.

333
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:34,933
''The prize is often left unclaimed.

334
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,867
We must have the courage to grasp it...

335
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,737
...for fortune always favors the bold.''

336
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:55,254
He always inspires me.

337
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,892
l have a design for the future. A master plan.

338
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,963
l will need able officers to help me carry it out.

339
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,129
You have the intelligence.

340
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,098
lf your heart matches...

341
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,866
...you will go far.

342
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,601
We'll talk more in weeks to come.

343
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,276
Dismissed.

344
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,606
Captain!

345
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,982
We'll be moving out tomorrow.

346
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:22,981
lssue those binoculars to a scout.

347
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,786
And the book, sir?

348
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:27,246
Burn it.

349
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,597
Quit moving!

350
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,332
What happened?

351
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:46,638
-What happened? What'd he say? -Nothing.

352
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,977
Did he say anything about me?

353
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,304
No!

354
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:58,715
-l'm getting out of here. -What are you talking about?

355
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,519
-Escaping. -What?!

356
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:05,421
You ever hear of Saint Rose? lt's on the coast.

357
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,959
-lt's a paradise. -We can't.

358
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:08,221
We could!

359
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,558
Between the 3 of us we could.

360
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,668
l can't.

361
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:19,768
l like it here. l like being a part of something.

362
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,367
Take a point!

363
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,249
Some of the men shot a lion.

364
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,052
They crawled into the thicket.

365
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:24,170
One of you dogs earned a treat.

366
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:26,906
Over there.

367
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,174
Those men hunted a lion this morning.

368
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,141
Must've been a goddamn zoo here before the war.

369
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,478
Anyway, a third man went in after it.

370
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,584
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

371
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:42,857
l want a volunteer.

372
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,186
One of you is going in there after him.

373
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,492
l'll go.

374
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,737
l guess size ain't a measure of courage.

375
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,304
ls it?

376
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,068
l don't think so, Captain!

377
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:37,111
Come out alive, you get a lion steak!

378
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:47,080
Maybe you'll find your Saint Rose over there.

379
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:55,553
What the hell are you waiting for, Christmas?

380
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,949
Why are you stopping?

381
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:55,885
l found him.

382
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,162
He got him.

383
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:04,897
Let's go.

384
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,227
Hurry up!

385
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,196
You still got a lion to bag!

386
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,820
You men get back in line!

387
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,221
-There he is! -Shoot him!

388
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,072
ln the water. Come back without him...

389
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,646
...and you and another man will die in his place.

390
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,144
Go! Go!

391
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,921
l'll get him!

392
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,259
Go!

393
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,622
Don't.

394
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:21,254
Just let me go.

395
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,055
l don't want to be a part of your army.

396
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,058
My army?

397
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,197
l like the sound of that.

398
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,934
l got him!

399
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,636
l'm sorry.

400
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:47,817
How come...

401
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:50,253
...you wrecked it...

402
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,317
...for me?

403
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,471
lt's me or you.

404
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:07,770
What?

405
00:42:10,346 --> 00:42:11,973
lt doesn't have to be.

406
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:16,112
We can go together. You and me.

407
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,221
Good boy!

408
00:42:23,492 --> 00:42:24,823
Good boy.

409
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:28,555

Bleeding?

416
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:46,104
Well, bleeder...

417
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:48,433
...you want your Saint Rose?

418

You shouldn't have.

421
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:45,805
Here's a piece of good news.

422
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:48,073
Jerry's decided to go to school...

423
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,116
...to get his contractor's license.

424
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:54,587
Good, Jerry.

425

And little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know that he lost...

426

...a tooth.

427

00:55:48,463 --> 00:55:49,657
Thanks.

511
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:54,158
Didn't somebody say something about dinner?

512
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:56,970
l'm supposed to take you to Foster's.

513
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:58,829
My name's Ford.

514
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:00,505
Ford Lincoln Mercury.

515
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,251
My name used to be John Stevens, but l changed it...

516
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:14,183
...on account of l want to drive cars.

517
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:19,854
This is where everybody meet and gather.

518
00:56:41,116 --> 00:56:43,016
Can you tell us about the government?

519
00:56:43,218 --> 00:56:46,119
-Tell us everything. -ls there a President?

520
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:48,747
Yeah.

521
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:50,356
What's his name?

522
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,588
-You know, l'm pretty hungry. -Come on.

523
00:56:56,297 --> 00:56:57,491
Please!

524
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:01,797
His name...

525
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,359
...is...

526
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:06,267
...Richard Starkey.

527
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,166
From Maine.

528
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:12,980
He has a saying.

529
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:16,213
''Stuff's getting better.

530
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:18,748
Stuff's getting better every day.''

531
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:22,755
ls he a Democrat or a Republican?

532
00:57:25,226 --> 00:57:27,126
Parties are over with.

533
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,130
lt's an individual that counts.

534
00:57:30,331 --> 00:57:31,559
What about Europe?

535
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,024
Europe?

536
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:34,064
Any word?

537
00:57:35,336 --> 00:57:36,360
Well, there's...

538
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:38,004
...good air in lceland.

539
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,799
ls Nathan Holn still alive?

540
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:45,075
He died.

541
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:48,644
Skin cancer.

542
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,249
He may be dead...

543
00:57:50,452 --> 00:57:55,253
...but what about the Holnists? What'll the government do about them?

544
00:57:58,293 --> 00:58:01,285
The government's just getting started.

545
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,361
So you're going to be on your own for 6, 8 or 1 8 months.

546
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:10,798
How about the Marine Corps?

547
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:12,136
Be quiet.

548
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,733
Everyone be quiet.

549
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,644
Can't we just let this man eat?

550
00:58:19,547 --> 00:58:20,775
Let us pray.

551
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:29,485
We give you thanks for this food...

552
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:31,119
...this day...

553
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:33,157
...this man and his good news...

554
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:36,190
...evidence of your promise...

555
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:38,262
...that you will hold our country together.

556
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,798
Amen.

557
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:23,907
Would you like to dance?

558
00:59:26,414 --> 00:59:28,348
l don't know if l can.

559
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,450
l think l'm still on duty.

560
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:36,517
All you have to do is hold on.

561
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:56,740
lt's been a long time.

562
01:00:06,254 --> 01:00:07,744
Something wrong?

563
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,724
How tall are you?

564
01:00:12,627 --> 01:00:14,254
About six feet.

565
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:15,793
Are you smart?

566
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:21,296
Smarter than some, l guess. Why?

567
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,335
Just wondering.

568
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,741
Have you ever had the bad mumps?

569
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:40,148
Never had the bad mumps.

570
01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:42,789
No syphilis, nothing like that?

571
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:48,495
So as far as you know...

572
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:51,232
...you have good semen?

573
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,328
ls that a trick question?

574
01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:59,433
No, it's not.

575
01:01:02,677 --> 01:01:03,701
l'm only asking...

576
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:06,873
...because l want you to make me pregnant.

577
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,509
All right...

578
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:12,212
...that's it.

579
01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:13,946
Wait.

580
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:15,553
Wait, please.

581
01:01:18,393 --> 01:01:20,588
lt's got to be the uniform.

582
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:24,555
This is my husband, Michael. He hasn't said no.

583
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,928
l haven't said anything yet.

584
01:01:28,169 --> 01:01:30,899
We've been trying to have a baby for 3 years.

585
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,506
We cannot on account of Michael. He had the bad mumps when he was 1 .

586
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:37,708
So we need a body father.

587
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,708
We could ask a man here, but it may cause problems.

588
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,474
We've seen it happen.

589
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:48,417
Things go okay until the woman shows, then it can be difficult.

590
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,784
But you'll only be around once in a while with the mail.

591
01:01:54,729 --> 01:01:56,492
You're the postman.

592
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,621
What do you say, mister?

593
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,093
You'd do us a favor.

594
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:06,865
l'm going to think about it.

595
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:17,049
Excuse me.

596
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:21,979
My mother would like to give you something.

597
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,357
He's right here, Mom.

598
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:30,062
lt's to my other daughter...

599
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:31,561
...Annie.

600
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,168
lt doesn't say where.

601
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:48,204
We don't know where she is. She left 5 years ago.

602
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,680
The last we heard she was living up north.

603
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:55,215
Look, Mrs. March, you should know that--

604
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,654
lKnow what?

605
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,999
l have a feeling about you.

606
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:10,203
l know you'll do what's right.

607
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:30,517
l got to get out of here.

608
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:46,967
Easy, boy.

609
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,836
lt's right around the corner.

610
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:54,876
What is?

611
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,709
What you're looking for.

612
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:09,797
What l'm looking for?

613
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:15,730
Crazy old coot.

614
01:04:58,045 --> 01:04:59,603
l knew you'd come here.

615
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,380
You did?

616
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,617
So how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?

617
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:15,693
You have to be in the right place at the right time.

618
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,658
How can l do it?

619
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,399
-l thought you wanted to drive cars. -Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.

620
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:25,970
This is real.

621
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,302
So where's the right place?

622
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:33,544
Could be anywhere, you know. Anytime.

623
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:37,643
Only another postman can make you a postman.

624
01:05:37,952 --> 01:05:39,943
lKind of like vampires, right?

625
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,451
Yeah, something like that.

626
01:05:46,494 --> 01:05:47,984
You have to be sworn in, so....

627
01:05:54,268 --> 01:05:58,034
The organization's kind of shaky right now. lt might not last.

628
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,570
What does?

629
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:04,177
You'd meet people who don't believe in you.

630
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,107
l'll set them straight.

631
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:09,643
lt's a lonely job.

632
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:13,046
l've been lonely all my life.

633
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:16,513
So have l, Ford.

634
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:18,858
So have l.

635
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:21,887
What the hell!

636
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:24,196
You repeat after me.

637
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:29,826
''Neither snow...

638
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,333
...nor rain...

639

...nor heat...

640

...nor gloom of night...

...stays these couriers...

642

...from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.''

643
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:48,581
Okay, then.

644
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:49,448
Okay, then.

645
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:54,027
No, l'm saying that. You just listen.

646
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:55,456
l'm sorry.

647
01:06:57,465 --> 01:07:00,593
By my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail.

648
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:03,033
Congratulations.

649
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,103
You're a postman.

650
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,147
l'd die to get a letter through.

651
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,414
What did you say?

652
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:21,513
-l said l'd die to get a letter through. -Johnny!

653
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:23,655
Why don't you run along.

654
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,550
l need to speak to this man.

655
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:29,654
l'll see you around.

656
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:32,261
Sure thing, Ford.

657
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:39,029
Johnny is impressed with you. Whole town is impressed with you.

658
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,969
l take it you're not.

659
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,576
-You're smarter than you look. -What can l do for you?

660
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:49,273
You can either clear out or l can throw you out. Either way suits me.

661
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:53,416
You don't understand. l'm a government employee authorized by--

662
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:56,215
You are not authorized by shit!

663
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,152
You were trying to sneak out of here. You are nothing...

664
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,626
...but a drifter who found a bag of mail. l want you out of town.

665
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:07,862
All right. This is going in my report.

666
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:11,137
These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman.

667
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,069
They need something real. They need help with the Holnists.

668
01:08:15,276 --> 01:08:17,267
Are you going to bring them that?

669
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:20,980
Didn't think so.

670
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,916
All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.

671
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:29,146
l aim to keep it that way.

672
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:31,692
You can stay here till morning...

673
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,827
...then l don't ever want to see you again.

674

01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,628
What the hell these people--

678
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,524
Just leave it.

679
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:16,603
l said, leave it.

680
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:24,711
''Saint Rose''?

681
01:09:50,237 --> 01:09:51,101
Hello, Abby.

682
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:55,665
You'll be leaving tomorrow?

683
01:09:57,878 --> 01:09:59,106
l guess.

684
01:10:04,351 --> 01:10:07,684
Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take.

685
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:10,618
They're so excited.

686
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:14,426
And how about you? Do you have a letter?

687
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,129
l don't have anybody to write to.

688
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,528
l'll find you a pen pal.

689
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:24,767
Someone with similar interests. You know?

690
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,701
Like dancing and...

691
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,304
...checking for mumps.

692
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:31,307
You're funny.

693
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,677
Hardly anybody's funny around here.

694
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:43,680
Have you decided yet?

695
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:57,966
Been thinking about it.

696
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:22,292
Sure.

697
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:24,186
l mean...

698
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:26,931
...why not?

699
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:36,008
God, you're so....

700
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:38,137
You're so...

701
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,341
...beautiful.

702
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,451
l'm sorry, you probably want to keep things more clinical.

703
01:11:47,788 --> 01:11:50,018
You don't even know my name.

704
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,690
l don't want to.

705
01:12:00,334 --> 01:12:01,926
lt would be easier for me...

706
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:04,263
...if you closed your eyes.

707
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,079
We took a vote, Mr. Postman.

708
01:14:32,686 --> 01:14:34,085
We want you to have this.

709
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:42,793
So you can't say no.

710
01:14:48,802 --> 01:14:50,326
l'll take it.

711
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,938
You got a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.

712
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,402
Good.

713
01:14:58,011 --> 01:14:59,069
Thank you.

714
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:01,270
Where will you go from here?

715
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:03,207
Go?

716
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:10,287
West...

717
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,618
...then l'll work my way...

718
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:17,160
...back here, sort of a figure eight.

719
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:26,430
Times seem hard right now.

720
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,004
But you got to believe things are getting better.

721
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:34,046
Birds are migrating again.

722
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:35,838
The rains are back.

723
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:38,676
Stuff's....

724
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:40,680
Stuff's getting better.

725
01:15:43,223 --> 01:15:44,884
Oh beautiful

726
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:50,790
For spacious skies

727
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:54,126
For amber waves of grain

728
01:15:58,639 --> 01:15:59,970
Shit!

729
01:16:00,874 --> 01:16:02,637
You've got a hell of a nerve, whoever you are.

730
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:12,178
Did you see Abby around this morning?

731
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,516
This is as far as l go.

732
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:18,318
You're on your own.

733
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:21,426
God shed his grace on thee

734
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:27,524
And crown thy good

735
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:29,861
With brotherhood

736
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,001
Are you really who you say you are?

737
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:36,008
lf l come back with some mail...

738
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,777
...you'll know.

739
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,050
Goddamn it!

740
01:17:16,516 --> 01:17:18,575
What are you looking at?

741
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:21,277
Everything.

742
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:24,017
They don't usually look at me.

743
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,761
Who is responsible...

744
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:44,500
...for that?

745
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:50,340
l said...

746
01:18:50,544 --> 01:18:53,012
...''Who's responsible...

747
01:18:53,213 --> 01:18:54,305
...for that''?!

748
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:02,778
Holnists, Johnny. You got to stay--

749
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:07,886
-You got to stay out of sight. -l'm a postman!

750
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:10,086
And l'm not running from anybody!

751
01:19:10,297 --> 01:19:13,289
Stay out of this, or l will lock you up myself.

752
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:25,503
You'll be responsible.

753
01:19:34,388 --> 01:19:36,686
Now set that flag on fire.

754
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:06,277
Throw it through the window of your post office.

755
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:09,050
Do it, Michael.

756
01:20:09,256 --> 01:20:11,417
lt's all right, Michael. Throw it.

757
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,291
The United States...

758
01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:20,523
...doesn't exist!

759
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,568
That flag is an abomination!

760
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:52,331
There was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it....

761
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,036
l looked at it and it had a color to it.

762
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:12,478
Good.

763
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:14,081
Everything.

764
01:21:16,089 --> 01:21:18,557
l was amazed. lt was....

765
01:21:19,693 --> 01:21:21,024
Good Lord!

766
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:23,956
That, gentlemen...

767
01:21:25,065 --> 01:21:27,431
...is a first-rate piece of ass.

768
01:21:30,203 --> 01:21:34,503
Tell the sheriff to introduce me. She doesn't belong in this mudhole.

769
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:35,935
Excuse me.

770
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:38,738
You again!

771
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:41,373
That's my wife, General.

772
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:43,313
She's a married woman.

773
01:21:43,783 --> 01:21:44,943
Really?

774
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:50,585
Do you know what system of government we have here?

775
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:56,451
We have what is known as a feudal system, like in the Middle Ages.

776
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:59,530
That's lords and vassals. That's you and me.

777
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,999
Now those lords...

778
01:22:02,202 --> 01:22:03,692
...they had some ideas.

779
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,998
They believed that if a vassal got married...

780
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:09,300
...it was the lord's right...

781
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:10,703
...his right...

782
01:22:11,378 --> 01:22:14,040
...to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.

783
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,178
Me and Abby have been married 3 years.

784
01:22:23,456 --> 01:22:26,220
l'm sorry, but l wasn't invited to the wedding.

785
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,062
You've already done me one favor, son.

786
01:22:35,936 --> 01:22:38,666
Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.

787
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,372
We'll be civilized about this.

788
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:53,643
l want you to give me your blessing.

789
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:03,485
Sir, l can't.

790
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,092
You can't?

791
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:09,457
You can't.

792
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,938
''Can't.''

793
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,573
We had a great nation once.

794
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:23,710
lKnow what made it great?

795
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:26,883
''l can.''

796
01:23:27,988 --> 01:23:29,250
Till the weak came along.

797
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,020
The ''l can'ts'' destroyed us!

798
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:36,995
l'm going to make us strong again.

799
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:39,355
l'm going to be the father...

800
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:41,166
...of a new nation.

801
01:23:42,168 --> 01:23:43,658
And do you know why...

802
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,428
...it will be me?

803
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,706
Because l can.

804
01:24:01,588 --> 01:24:02,850
Stop it!

805
01:24:07,327 --> 01:24:08,692
You're killing him!

806
01:24:09,396 --> 01:24:10,294
Let me go!

807
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:13,997
Please, let me go!

808
01:24:21,841 --> 01:24:23,832
Help him, somebody! Please!

809
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:33,850
You didn't have to--!

810
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:36,312
Didn't have to what?

811
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:40,858
You bastard!

812
01:24:42,696 --> 01:24:44,129
You killed him!

813
01:24:44,898 --> 01:24:47,059
Your people seem seditious.

814
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,526
You seem seditious.

815
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:54,136
What am l seeing here?

816
01:24:54,574 --> 01:24:55,404
l'm waiting!

817
01:25:04,984 --> 01:25:08,943
A man came through with mail. Said he was a postman.

818
01:25:09,155 --> 01:25:11,885
Said that the government had been restored back east.

819
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:13,957
What government?

820
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,519
The United States government!

821
01:25:19,499 --> 01:25:20,591
Who said that?

822
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:40,948
Which way did he go?

823
01:25:41,855 --> 01:25:43,550
Do not make me ask again.

824
01:25:43,757 --> 01:25:44,587
East.

825
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,657
Send a patrol east!

826
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:49,453
Send 3 more...

827
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:51,553
...north, south and west!

828
01:25:53,032 --> 01:25:54,863
They'd better find him east.

829
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:17,286
Take that damn shirt off, Johnny!

830
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:22,524
l managed to save these.

831
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,594
Do you want to die too?

832
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:29,161
l'm headed south with the mail.

833
01:26:32,138 --> 01:26:33,765
Don't be a fool.

834
01:26:34,474 --> 01:26:35,998
What should l be?

835
01:26:48,221 --> 01:26:49,552
Rachel Clark.

836
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:55,390
''Charlie Sykes.''

837
01:27:02,335 --> 01:27:03,825
''Graham Drewitt.''

838
01:27:04,537 --> 01:27:07,267
G.D. died of flu last winter.

839
01:27:09,876 --> 01:27:11,605
That's all there is.

840
01:27:13,379 --> 01:27:14,676
That's all there is, folks.

841
01:27:15,248 --> 01:27:16,044
For now.

842
01:27:17,383 --> 01:27:22,082
But there'll be more, lots more, once there's a real system in place.

843
01:27:23,423 --> 01:27:24,412
Right?

844
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:29,453
What about New York City?

845
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:32,495
Did they survive the plague?

846
01:27:35,535 --> 01:27:36,763
Survive?

847
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:42,038
They got Broadway up and running again.

848
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:48,848
There's a kid doing Andrew Floyd Webber, you wouldn't believe.

849
01:27:49,048 --> 01:27:50,709
How much is it to mail a letter?

850
01:27:51,818 --> 01:27:52,944
''Mail....''

851
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,411
They won't open the gates.

852
01:28:24,918 --> 01:28:28,911
They say they got a representative of the Restored United States in there.

853
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:31,289
They say this army is illegal.

854
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,753
-And they say-- -Drop dead!

855
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,053
And go to hell!

856
01:28:38,364 --> 01:28:39,661
That's what they say.

857
01:28:39,866 --> 01:28:41,891
What are you doing?! Open the gates.

858
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:47,565
ldiots!

859
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,370
What're you thinking?!

860
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,478
The Romans...

861
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:57,412
...had an expression...

862
01:28:57,617 --> 01:29:00,450
...they used to scare their children.

863
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,252
''Hannibal...

864
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:06,016
...ad portas!''

865
01:29:07,393 --> 01:29:08,758
Hannibal...

866
01:29:09,629 --> 01:29:11,654
...is at the gates.

867
01:29:18,805 --> 01:29:20,670
Do you know who Hannibal was?

868
01:29:22,675 --> 01:29:23,835
Of course not.

869
01:29:24,043 --> 01:29:26,944
A pretty girl like you wouldn't understand something like that.

870
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:34,045
-Let's fight them! -With what?

871
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:37,518
We've got 5 guns, maybe 0 rounds of ammo.

872
01:29:37,724 --> 01:29:39,487
How we going to fight with that?

873
01:29:39,692 --> 01:29:40,852
You don't.

874
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:46,229
Negotiate a settlement.

875
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,196
Give them extra supplies.

876
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:56,466
You're the government rep. Tell them.

877
01:30:11,424 --> 01:30:12,516
Right here.

878
01:30:23,302 --> 01:30:26,066
Make it quick. l've got an attack to coordinate.

879
01:30:27,206 --> 01:30:29,538
They've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty.

880
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:34,243
Do l know you?

881
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,334
l don't think so, sir.

882
01:30:38,112 --> 01:30:39,704
You're the postman.

883
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:41,112
Aren't you?

884
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:45,743
lnside!

885
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:51,919
''U.S. Mail.''

886
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,961
''The Restored United States of America.''

887
01:30:56,597 --> 01:30:59,532
Do these people really believe that shit?!

888
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,994
Who are you, really?

889
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,698
l'm a United States postman...

890
01:31:06,073 --> 01:31:09,634
...authorized by Order 4 1 7 of the Restored Congress.

891
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:13,974
l was at the Battle of Georgetown. l watched the White House burn down.

892
01:31:14,181 --> 01:31:16,206
Do not try to sell me...

893
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,783
...on any Restored United States!

894
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:24,285
The new capital is based in Minneapolis...

895
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:27,183
...inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome.

896
01:31:27,795 --> 01:31:30,320
You know where the Vikings used to play?

897
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,865
You're funny.

898
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,135
What are the terms?

899
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:44,939
They'll open the gates, give double the usual...

900
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:46,309
...just...

901
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,845
...don't hurt anybody.

902
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:49,776
This was all a misunderstanding.

903
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,818
l appreciate your offer, Mr. Postman.

904
01:32:00,027 --> 01:32:03,656
But the fact is that you're in no position to negotiate.

905
01:32:04,165 --> 01:32:07,657
These people made it through the bugs and the riots...

906
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:11,735
...and the 3-year winters, but they're not going to survive you.

907
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,038
Fire at will!

908
01:32:24,618 --> 01:32:25,983
Law Six:

909
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:28,280
Justice can be...

910
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:29,717
...dictated!

911
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:36,656
lKill him, and kill the Restored United States with him.

912
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,748
ln accordance with Law 8...

913
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:03,549
...and by the authority of Emergency Order 46...

914
01:33:03,757 --> 01:33:05,247
...you are hereby--

915
01:33:12,633 --> 01:33:13,531
Get her!

916
01:34:07,788 --> 01:34:09,449
Go on, get him!

917
01:34:30,711 --> 01:34:32,736
We can't stop now.

918
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:36,510
What are you...?

919
01:34:39,553 --> 01:34:40,815
Oh, God!

920
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,354
Come on down.

921
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:26,906
Don't move.

922
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:35,850
lf you had a bullet, you'd use it.

923
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,757
Come on.

924
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:48,048
l don't think l ever had water soup before.

925
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:52,255
Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand.

926
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,022
Dirt.

927
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,494
Maybe a twig garnish.

928
01:38:04,537 --> 01:38:06,528
You used to think l was funny.

929
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:12,204
They killed Michael.

930
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:22,688
l'm sorry.

931
01:38:26,993 --> 01:38:28,255
How sorry are you?

932
01:38:29,729 --> 01:38:30,753
What?

933
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:37,894
What's that supposed to mean?

934
01:38:40,907 --> 01:38:41,703
What's with you?

935
01:38:41,908 --> 01:38:44,035
You have the mark of 8 on you.

936
01:38:45,912 --> 01:38:46,879
Mark doesn't mean--

937
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:48,740
You're a liar.

938
01:38:51,818 --> 01:38:52,910
You were with Bethlehem.

939
01:38:53,953 --> 01:38:56,046
Does that make you one of them?

940
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,127
Don't make me use this.

941
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:26,709
Wind's come up.

942
01:39:27,053 --> 01:39:28,315
It's getting colder too.

943
01:39:29,222 --> 01:39:31,656
Must be another storm.

944
01:39:35,328 --> 01:39:36,761
Anything else?

945
01:39:38,464 --> 01:39:40,432
l didn't mean for you to....

946
01:39:40,633 --> 01:39:44,228
Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.

947
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,333
-l'm hurt. -You're lazy!

948
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:47,699
Lazy?

949
01:39:47,974 --> 01:39:50,204
l got a hole in my stomach...

950
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:51,933
...and l'm weak.

951
01:39:52,144 --> 01:39:55,739
The  big meals around here are snow and grass...

952
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,007
...and we're running out of grass.

953
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,357
What're you doing?

954
01:40:36,622 --> 01:40:37,816
Give me a break!

955
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:41,656
l'm going to check the pass.

956
01:40:43,563 --> 01:40:45,190
Why are you in such a hurry?

957
01:40:45,398 --> 01:40:47,696
l could think of worse places.

958
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:50,896
Or l could think of worse company.

959
01:40:58,277 --> 01:40:59,608
Perfect!

960
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:58,829
Help!

961
01:42:06,512 --> 01:42:07,308
Help!

962
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,142
Please!

963
01:42:13,552 --> 01:42:14,519
Quick!

964
01:42:25,665 --> 01:42:27,257
God, help me!

965
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,110
l told you that's all there was.

966
01:42:50,389 --> 01:42:52,448
That's why you should have it.

967
01:42:57,863 --> 01:42:59,694
l knew you could walk.

968
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:03,362
You're weird.

969
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,168
lKnow that?

970
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,194
We walked on the moon once, Abby.

971
01:43:32,064 --> 01:43:33,497
So?

972
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,068
What good is that now?

973
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:41,338
Obviously you've forgotten...

974
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,905
...Tang and...

975
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:45,201
...microwave ovens and....

976
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,242
Your face looks pretty.

977
01:43:58,157 --> 01:43:59,454
l mean...

978
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:02,050
...not so bruised.

979
01:44:09,235 --> 01:44:10,463
Look...

980
01:44:11,103 --> 01:44:12,593
...there's something you'd better know.

981
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,567
You're going to find out soon enough.

982
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,840
l'm pregnant.

983
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,638
lt's Michael's baby.

984
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:27,145
You're just the body father.

985
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:34,456
How do you know it's mine...

986
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:37,926
...not Bethlehem's?

987
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,230
He tried with me almost every night.

988
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,569
He couldn't do it...

989
01:44:54,446 --> 01:44:56,073
...so he beat me.

990
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:02,312
Said it was my fault.

991
01:45:08,627 --> 01:45:09,594
l'm sorry, Abby.

992
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:50,666
What is it?

993
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:53,227
What's wrong?

994
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,199
ls it the baby?

995
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,968
The pass is clear.

996
01:46:22,234 --> 01:46:23,701
What happened?

997
01:46:26,105 --> 01:46:28,130
Good, you got our stuff out.

998
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,602
Of course.

999
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:31,668
What?

1000
01:46:33,579 --> 01:46:35,069
l don't understand.

1001
01:46:36,148 --> 01:46:38,048
l set the fire.

1002
01:46:41,253 --> 01:46:43,346
Did you think we'd stay here forever?

1003
01:46:43,923 --> 01:46:45,083
No.

1004
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,994
l'd appreciate it if you'd walk with me to find someplace safe for the baby...

1005
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:53,960
...then we can split up.

1006
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:55,030
You shaved.

1007
01:46:57,169 --> 01:46:58,101
Looks nice.

1008
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,969
You're really weird!

1009
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:08,510
You know that?

1010
01:47:15,821 --> 01:47:17,948
You ever heard of Saint Rose, Abby?

1011
01:47:18,524 --> 01:47:20,287
l've heard people talk.

1012
01:47:20,492 --> 01:47:22,619
l've heard lots of names...

1013
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:25,958
...Bliss, Hesperia, and New Eden.

1014
01:47:26,298 --> 01:47:28,892
Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.

1015
01:47:29,134 --> 01:47:30,396
He's wrong.

1016
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:32,601
Saint Rose is out there...

1017
01:47:33,138 --> 01:47:34,366
...and l'm going to find it.

1018
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:36,097
But you're the postman.

1019
01:47:36,308 --> 01:47:37,935
l'm nobody, Abby.

1020
01:47:52,992 --> 01:47:54,584
This is what l hate.

1021
01:47:54,793 --> 01:47:56,124
Strangers.

1022
01:47:56,328 --> 01:47:58,888
Do you say hi, or do you blow their heads off?

1023
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:01,760
Do they want to share what they got or take what you have?

1024
01:48:03,202 --> 01:48:06,831
lf they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them?

1025
01:48:08,007 --> 01:48:09,804
All right, that's far enough.

1026
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,638
We don't want any trouble.

1027
01:48:15,681 --> 01:48:16,978
Me neither, mister.

1028
01:48:19,251 --> 01:48:20,081
What are you?

1029
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:21,843
Carrier 1 8...

1030
01:48:22,321 --> 01:48:24,186
...U.S. Postal Service.

1031
01:48:25,157 --> 01:48:26,021
Got any mail?

1032
01:48:26,392 --> 01:48:27,984
That's impossible.

1033
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:32,324
Ain't you heard of The Postman?

1034
01:48:33,999 --> 01:48:35,057
No.

1035
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:37,065
Tell us.

1036
01:48:37,936 --> 01:48:40,564
He's only the greatest man who ever lived.

1037
01:48:41,173 --> 01:48:43,038
He crossed the wasteland...

1038
01:48:43,242 --> 01:48:45,301
...shook his fist at the enemy...

1039
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:49,038
...and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself.

1040
01:48:49,782 --> 01:48:52,649
He's back east with President Starkey right now.

1041
01:48:53,519 --> 01:48:55,248
Who told you all this?

1042
01:48:55,821 --> 01:48:58,221
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1043
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,958
He's in direct contact with the restored Congress.

1044
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,957
Direct contact?!

1045
01:49:03,228 --> 01:49:04,422
l don't believe this!

1046
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:06,029
Carrier camp!

1047
01:49:06,231 --> 01:49:07,721
Carrier camp!

1048
01:49:07,933 --> 01:49:09,423
Gather around, everybody!

1049
01:49:09,635 --> 01:49:12,229
Come on, gather around. Got another letter here.

1050
01:49:13,605 --> 01:49:15,197
lt came in last night.

1051
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:21,977
-What's all this? -The Postman sent Ford another letter.

1052
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:23,842
He's going to read it.

1053
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:27,346
''Hello, all postal carriers.

1054
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:35,183
l'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey...

1055
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:37,294
...but my thoughts are with you.

1056
01:49:37,663 --> 01:49:38,652
Remember...

1057
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:41,697
...nothing worth doing can be done overnight.

1058
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:45,734
lKeep your chins up and do your best not to get shot.

1059
01:49:45,938 --> 01:49:46,768
Signed...

1060
01:49:47,406 --> 01:49:48,430
...The Postman'' !

1061
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:54,702
His letters are always kind of short.

1062
01:49:55,814 --> 01:49:57,247
Hold on! There's a P.S.

1063
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:01,413
Does anybody know what P.S. stands for?

1064
01:50:18,103 --> 01:50:20,401
-Holy shit! -That would be H.S., Eddie.

1065
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:24,600
No, l saw him once when l lived in Pineview.

1066
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:26,141
lt's The Postman.

1067
01:50:58,844 --> 01:51:00,744
Guess you want to talk about this.

1068
01:51:11,757 --> 01:51:13,622
l found him! l found him!

1069
01:51:19,665 --> 01:51:21,223
''Minneapolis?''

1070
01:51:21,733 --> 01:51:24,930
''P.S. Ford knows what to do?''

1071
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:27,533
What is this?

1072
01:51:28,006 --> 01:51:30,133
What is all this? What the hell--

1073
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:31,606
l lied!

1074
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:34,973
l told people you were in direct contact with me.

1075
01:51:37,282 --> 01:51:40,581
-Why? -Because l didn't want it to end.

1076
01:51:43,689 --> 01:51:44,815
Look...

1077
01:51:45,557 --> 01:51:49,220
...l don't know how long l can stay. l mean...

1078
01:51:49,428 --> 01:51:50,952
...President Starkey...

1079
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:55,827
...he's going to send word for me one day and then l'll have to move on.

1080
01:51:56,902 --> 01:51:58,460
Do you understand?

1081
01:52:05,644 --> 01:52:08,807
But you'll stay until he sends word, right?

1082
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:21,482
Don't do that. Hands down.

1083
01:52:23,295 --> 01:52:26,128
You're staying till President Starkey sends word, right?

1084
01:52:26,632 --> 01:52:27,656
Yes!

1085
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:29,766
Until he sends word. Right.

1086
01:52:31,003 --> 01:52:34,336
Could you say a few words just so they know it's really you?

1087
01:52:40,078 --> 01:52:41,409
lt's me.

1088
01:53:00,032 --> 01:53:01,465
Coming down.

1089
01:53:05,103 --> 01:53:07,435
We bring all the mail here first.

1090
01:53:08,173 --> 01:53:09,470
We sort it.

1091
01:53:09,675 --> 01:53:11,905
We group it. Then it goes out.

1092
01:53:12,544 --> 01:53:14,876
So far, we got 30 routes.

1093
01:53:25,657 --> 01:53:27,716
You spelled ''tyranny'' wrong.

1094
01:53:29,561 --> 01:53:30,789
Boy!

1095
01:53:31,396 --> 01:53:32,954
He's smart.

1096
01:53:34,132 --> 01:53:36,066
From the swift completion...

1097
01:53:37,135 --> 01:53:38,727
...of their appointed rounds.

1098
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:44,606
Congratulations. You are now U.S. postal carriers.

1099
01:53:57,522 --> 01:53:58,784
How old are you?

1100
01:53:59,524 --> 01:54:01,458
l'm 68, sir.

1101
01:54:04,863 --> 01:54:06,558
Can l ask you a question?

1102
01:54:09,701 --> 01:54:11,032
Can you ride?

1103
01:54:11,269 --> 01:54:12,258
No.

1104
01:54:12,437 --> 01:54:14,268
Can't walk too good either.

1105
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,871
So why are you here?

1106
01:54:17,442 --> 01:54:19,034
l know stuff.

1107
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:26,283
Where did you get that?

1108
01:54:29,688 --> 01:54:31,918
1 9 70.

1109
01:54:32,924 --> 01:54:35,358
A girl with eyes as big as saucers...

1110
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,120
...did me in a little town called Saigon.

1111
01:54:56,982 --> 01:54:59,576
Ford wants me to have his place.

1112
01:55:00,752 --> 01:55:01,912
Said it's the best.

1113
01:55:05,957 --> 01:55:07,185
l'm on the other side.

1114
01:55:10,662 --> 01:55:12,687
l got plenty of room here.

1115
01:55:17,769 --> 01:55:20,397
So much for the uniform theory.

1116
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,772
He was captured on the Oregon border.

1117
01:55:32,083 --> 01:55:33,914
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:55:34,119 --> 01:55:35,017
Carrier 1 .

1119
01:55:36,521 --> 01:55:38,045
United States Postal Service.

1120
01:55:53,371 --> 01:55:56,238
l want the camp struck at dawn.

1121
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,543
We'll be moving north!

1122
01:56:06,284 --> 01:56:08,684
You spelled ''tyranny'' wrong.

1123
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:13,885
l wish they'd stop saluting.

1124
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:24,834
Just stay safe.

1125
01:56:26,037 --> 01:56:27,368
Remember...

1126
01:56:27,973 --> 01:56:29,964
...the mailman's more important than the mail.

1127
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:33,505
Boy, he's smart.

1128
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:40,979
When l was a kid we used to turn our hat around backwards.

1129
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:44,319
Thought it was cool.

1130
01:56:51,496 --> 01:56:53,123
Jesus Christ!

1131
01:57:03,074 --> 01:57:04,132
Damn!

1132
01:58:12,644 --> 01:58:13,611
l missed him.

1133
02:00:03,621 --> 02:00:05,680
What's the name of this town?

1134
02:00:08,126 --> 02:00:09,593
We never named it.

1135
02:00:12,063 --> 02:00:13,724
l officially declare...

1136
02:00:13,932 --> 02:00:16,127
...Postal Station Number 1 0...

1137
02:00:17,202 --> 02:00:18,669
...in Elvis, Oregon...

1138
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:20,531
...open for business.

1139
02:00:23,408 --> 02:00:27,435
From now on you got to get your mail down there, okay?

1140
02:00:28,379 --> 02:00:30,074
This one doesn't work.

1141
02:00:42,093 --> 02:00:43,526
Read it again.

1142
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:45,522
Are you sure?

1143
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:46,822
Yes.

1144
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,094
''Dearest Mom: What a miracle to hear from you.''

1145
02:00:57,475 --> 02:00:59,466
Stuff is getting better.

1146
02:00:59,978 --> 02:01:02,412
Stuff is getting better every day.

1147
02:01:06,518 --> 02:01:07,712
l don't know who you are...

1148
02:01:10,455 --> 02:01:12,855
...but l do know l was wrong about you.

1149
02:01:17,695 --> 02:01:19,788
Got a letter for you too, Sheriff.

1150
02:01:33,244 --> 02:01:35,007
lt's from my sister.

1151
02:01:36,514 --> 02:01:37,981
Thought she was dead.

1152
02:01:39,784 --> 02:01:41,183
You thought wrong.

1153
02:02:02,307 --> 02:02:04,366
Would you like to dance?

1154
02:02:09,547 --> 02:02:11,742
Well, they say that you can never

1155
02:02:14,152 --> 02:02:15,779
Never go back home

1156
02:02:21,492 --> 02:02:23,653
And if you're bound to wander

1157
02:02:26,764 --> 02:02:28,732
You're bound to be alone

1158
02:02:33,605 --> 02:02:35,869
You say I got no right

1159
02:02:37,242 --> 02:02:39,437
To feel what I feel

1160
02:02:40,345 --> 02:02:42,438
When I look into your eyes

1161
02:02:43,982 --> 02:02:45,210
Want to dance?

1162
02:02:45,884 --> 02:02:48,216
But that I dream of you

1163
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,815
Most every night

1164
02:02:52,857 --> 02:02:54,848
Comes as no surprise

1165
02:02:58,463 --> 02:03:02,422
Well, I've been Out on this road for so long

1166
02:03:05,203 --> 02:03:06,431
Far and wide

1167
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:08,901
Do I roam

1168
02:03:11,342 --> 02:03:15,210
But something in your smile tells me

1169
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:19,209
I'm almost home

1170
02:03:37,835 --> 02:03:39,359
I was lost in the dark

1171
02:03:39,804 --> 02:03:40,896
All alone

1172
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:44,140
Till the light

1173
02:03:44,342 --> 02:03:46,833
In your eyes showed me

1174
02:03:47,812 --> 02:03:49,177
I was almost

1175
02:03:49,914 --> 02:03:51,939
Home is where the heart is

1176
02:03:53,418 --> 02:03:54,385
And my heart goes with you

1177
02:03:55,586 --> 02:03:57,747
I would travel till the end of time

1178
02:03:58,957 --> 02:04:01,391
If that's what I have to do

1179
02:04:02,126 --> 02:04:04,856
Just to spend one night

1180
02:04:05,263 --> 02:04:07,823
Till your sweet love light

1181
02:04:08,032 --> 02:04:09,431
Come down

1182
02:04:12,136 --> 02:04:14,502
Shining down on me

1183
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:29,880
Hello.

1184
02:04:32,957 --> 02:04:34,720
Who do you talk to?

1185
02:04:34,993 --> 02:04:37,962
Not a soul in 7 years of trying...

1186
02:04:38,229 --> 02:04:39,560
...but l will.

1187
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:44,761
Want some?

1188
02:04:44,969 --> 02:04:46,527
No, thanks.

1189
02:04:47,171 --> 02:04:49,537
Don't let the kids see that.

1190
02:04:49,874 --> 02:04:51,569
You go ahead, take a look.

1191
02:04:52,377 --> 02:04:54,845
l was an aerospace engineer.

1192
02:04:55,213 --> 02:04:58,444
l helped design the Galileo Space Station.

1193
02:04:58,850 --> 02:04:59,908
No shit?

1194
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:01,312
No shit.

1195
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:05,314
l dream it's orbiting the Earth forever...

1196
02:05:06,124 --> 02:05:07,785
...with a dozen human skeletons...

1197
02:05:08,659 --> 02:05:10,320
...all grinning at each other...

1198
02:05:11,062 --> 02:05:12,893
...laughing at us down here.

1199
02:05:24,609 --> 02:05:26,702
-What is it? -lt's Tony.

1200
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:28,610
He's overdue.

1201
02:05:30,782 --> 02:05:32,249
That makes 5.

1202
02:05:33,317 --> 02:05:35,251
All on southern routes.

1203
02:05:41,692 --> 02:05:43,455
Just children.

1204
02:05:44,095 --> 02:05:45,960
You bring me children.

1205
02:05:46,397 --> 02:05:48,092
l want a man.

1206
02:05:52,804 --> 02:05:54,567
We got births and...

1207
02:05:54,772 --> 02:05:55,898
...deaths.

1208
02:05:56,107 --> 02:05:58,575
Got weather. Mostly gossip.

1209
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:00,434
There's nothing here.

1210
02:06:00,878 --> 02:06:02,175
Nothing?

1211
02:06:03,047 --> 02:06:04,344
Everything...

1212
02:06:04,549 --> 02:06:05,880
...is here.

1213
02:06:06,884 --> 02:06:10,342
Am l the only one who sees that?!

1214
02:06:10,755 --> 02:06:11,779
What?

1215
02:06:21,499 --> 02:06:24,366
A military man, especially a commander...

1216
02:06:24,569 --> 02:06:26,002
...should keep a journal.

1217
02:06:26,337 --> 02:06:28,498
After he's gone, it's the only real defense...

1218
02:06:28,673 --> 02:06:31,665
...against the slander that later arises.

1219
02:06:56,801 --> 02:06:59,031
Tell me about the other stuff you know.

1220
02:07:53,524 --> 02:07:54,456
Shit!

1221
02:09:39,664 --> 02:09:41,063
Get rid of the bodies.

1222
02:09:42,133 --> 02:09:44,931
l don't want these people blamed for what we did.

1223
02:09:47,371 --> 02:09:50,534
Neither snow, nor rain, nor gloom of night...

1224
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:55,272
...through bandit's hell, through firefight...

1225
02:09:57,114 --> 02:09:59,582
...through flood and plague we cannot fail...

1226
02:10:01,519 --> 02:10:04,113
...no Holnist trash will stop the mail.

1227
02:10:06,791 --> 02:10:09,089
You are now U.S. Postal Carriers.

1228
02:10:11,829 --> 02:10:13,387
They changed the oath.

1229
02:10:14,065 --> 02:10:15,123
Ford's idea.

1230
02:10:16,033 --> 02:10:17,261
Figures.

1231
02:10:18,235 --> 02:10:20,703
They don't think to ask who they're replacing...

1232
02:10:20,905 --> 02:10:22,065
...or why.

1233
02:10:22,973 --> 02:10:24,133
Sir?

1234
02:10:27,411 --> 02:10:29,777
lt'd be an honor if l could shake your hand.

1235
02:10:31,982 --> 02:10:32,641
Do l know you?

1236
02:10:35,653 --> 02:10:37,120
l don't think so.

1237
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,015
Good luck, then.

1238
02:10:50,868 --> 02:10:52,165
Nice kid.

1239
02:10:52,937 --> 02:10:54,996
He'll probably be dead in a week.

1240
02:10:55,206 --> 02:10:57,367
Now that is not your fault.

1241
02:10:57,775 --> 02:11:01,176
You're exhausted. You need rest. There's food--

1242
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,980
-Where are you going? -Route .

1243
02:11:05,549 --> 02:11:07,813
You're grounded. Get off the horse.

1244
02:11:08,786 --> 02:11:09,616
You know the rule.

1245
02:11:09,987 --> 02:11:10,783
What rule?

1246
02:11:12,189 --> 02:11:14,384
, it's too far south. Get off the horse.

1247
02:11:14,592 --> 02:11:15,991
But they're waiting on--

1248
02:11:16,193 --> 02:11:17,820
Get off the goddamn horse!

1249
02:11:20,264 --> 02:11:22,129
l'll tie him off to this one.

1250
02:11:22,533 --> 02:11:24,000
You can't keep doing this!

1251
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:26,630
-Doing what? -Riding all the routes.

1252
02:11:26,837 --> 02:11:28,737
You're not saving anybody.

1253
02:11:30,674 --> 02:11:33,700
Did l ever tell you how l got to be a postman?

1254
02:11:35,579 --> 02:11:37,342
l don't know if you'd laugh or cry.

1255
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:43,912
What is it?

1256
02:11:45,756 --> 02:11:46,586
Watch out!

1257
02:11:54,365 --> 02:11:55,855
We got fire! Move!

1258
02:12:31,469 --> 02:12:34,131
-''Postage due.'' -Elvis patrol.

1259
02:12:39,543 --> 02:12:41,238
You want a war?

1260
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,905
You want a war?!

1261
02:12:45,516 --> 02:12:47,177
l'll give you...

1262
02:12:47,384 --> 02:12:49,181
...a war!

1263
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:51,419
l was...

1264
02:12:51,622 --> 02:12:54,056
...born for it!

1265
02:12:54,992 --> 02:12:56,619
You murderers!

1266
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:00,993
You think you can ride?!

1267
02:13:02,533 --> 02:13:04,865
Then today's your lucky day!

1268
02:13:05,636 --> 02:13:07,228
Bethlehem says...

1269
02:13:08,072 --> 02:13:09,596
...he's headed north.

1270
02:13:10,908 --> 02:13:13,274
He's going to kill 1 0 people in every town...

1271
02:13:13,477 --> 02:13:15,945
...then burn it to the ground for what you did.

1272
02:13:17,681 --> 02:13:19,911
He said that Pineview's on his way.

1273
02:13:21,485 --> 02:13:23,578
He'd wait there for you, but not for long.

1274
02:13:25,823 --> 02:13:27,688
l was so scared, sir.

1275
02:13:28,025 --> 02:13:30,391
l thought they were going to kill me too.

1276
02:13:37,701 --> 02:13:38,565
See?

1277
02:13:38,769 --> 02:13:40,930
We're too late. l told you.

1278
02:13:41,338 --> 02:13:42,703
What're you going to do?

1279
02:13:42,907 --> 02:13:44,431
l'm going to stop this.

1280
02:13:45,175 --> 02:13:45,971
You can't.

1281
02:13:46,277 --> 02:13:48,336
Get out of the way, Ford. All of you!

1282
02:13:48,546 --> 02:13:49,774
They'll kill you!

1283
02:13:53,751 --> 02:13:54,809
Hold him!

1284
02:13:58,088 --> 02:13:58,952
Stop it!

1285
02:14:00,624 --> 02:14:01,716
-You're hurting him! -l'm not!

1286
02:14:01,926 --> 02:14:02,893
Yes, you are!

1287
02:14:03,093 --> 02:14:05,425
l'm not! l'm not hurting him.

1288
02:14:06,363 --> 02:14:10,265
This is all my doing. l went against your orders.

1289
02:14:11,068 --> 02:14:14,834
You told me to bury the dead Holnists, but l sent them Bethlehem.

1290
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:16,063
Why?

1291
02:14:16,407 --> 02:14:17,704
Bethlehem has to know we won't stop!

1292
02:14:18,142 --> 02:14:19,905
Goddamn it, Ford!

1293
02:14:21,378 --> 02:14:23,846
Those people are dying because of us!

1294
02:14:24,048 --> 02:14:26,346
They're dying because of what we did.

1295
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:29,075
They're not! They're dying because of Bethlehem...

1296
02:14:29,286 --> 02:14:32,380
...because this is a shitty world! lf we're going to change it...

1297
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:34,251
...then someone might have to die.

1298
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:37,222
lf l could make it be me down there, l would, but l can't!

1299
02:14:40,631 --> 02:14:41,996
No! Please!

1300
02:14:44,435 --> 02:14:45,868
-You, out here! -Hold her!

1301
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,435
Please!

1302
02:15:04,521 --> 02:15:06,489
He's out there somewhere.

1303
02:15:08,258 --> 02:15:09,486
Watching.

1304
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,726
l can feel it.

1305
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:18,932
You feel it too, don't you?

1306
02:15:20,537 --> 02:15:22,869
lt didn't have to end like this, Sheriff!

1307
02:15:23,374 --> 02:15:27,174
He knew where l'd be if he wanted to face me like a man!

1308
02:15:27,945 --> 02:15:29,537
lnstead he's hiding...

1309
02:15:29,747 --> 02:15:31,112
...like a rabbit!

1310
02:15:31,582 --> 02:15:33,573
So much for your Postman!

1311
02:15:34,385 --> 02:15:35,647
Lieutenant!

1312
02:15:36,553 --> 02:15:37,485
Ready!

1313
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:40,480
We don't even know their names.

1314
02:15:41,692 --> 02:15:43,387
We know their names.

1315
02:15:48,565 --> 02:15:49,554
l think that's my dad.

1316
02:15:58,842 --> 02:15:59,968
Aim!

1317
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:02,108
Ride, Postman!

1318
02:16:02,713 --> 02:16:04,010
Ride!

1319
02:16:04,415 --> 02:16:05,609
You hear me?!

1320
02:16:05,816 --> 02:16:07,681
l said, ''Ride!''

1321
02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:09,982
Fire!

1322
02:16:33,744 --> 02:16:35,837
My God, what have l done?

1323
02:16:38,882 --> 02:16:40,543
What Ford did was wrong!

1324
02:16:44,421 --> 02:16:46,514
But it doesn't change anything...

1325
02:16:46,724 --> 02:16:49,955
...for any of us, does it?

1326
02:17:12,783 --> 02:17:14,011
ls this everybody?

1327
02:17:15,119 --> 02:17:16,552
The rest are on the overdue list.

1328
02:17:18,055 --> 02:17:19,613
Then this is everybody.

1329
02:17:20,824 --> 02:17:22,951
Got a letter from the President.

1330
02:17:25,395 --> 02:17:27,022
''Greetings, all carriers.''

1331
02:17:27,231 --> 02:17:28,892
Greetings, President Starkey!

1332
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:35,638
''l've been in contact with The Postman.

1333
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:37,670
And l've received all the reports.

1334
02:17:38,242 --> 02:17:39,903
l'm proud of you all.

1335
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:42,903
ln dark days, in a weary world...

1336
02:17:43,113 --> 02:17:45,581
...you gave everything and asked for nothing.

1337
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:49,175
You beat back despair and replaced it with hope.

1338
02:17:49,953 --> 02:17:52,319
For that, your country can never repay you.

1339
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:54,747
But the price is too high...

1340
02:17:56,493 --> 02:17:59,656
...and l won't see any more of my bravest die.

1341
02:18:01,231 --> 02:18:03,791
lt is my duty to hereby disband...

1342
02:18:04,001 --> 02:18:07,437
...the Postal Service of the Restored United States.

1343
02:18:08,305 --> 02:18:10,398
You are to burn your uniforms...

1344
02:18:10,607 --> 02:18:14,099
...and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once.

1345
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,311
Thank you.

1346
02:18:16,947 --> 02:18:18,574
And God bless you all.

1347
02:18:19,516 --> 02:18:20,710
The President.''

1348
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:40,665
The President never wrote that letter.

1349
02:18:41,205 --> 02:18:43,469
lf he could've, that's what he would have said.

1350
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,537
Who's the other letter to?

1351
02:18:45,742 --> 02:18:46,970
Bethlehem.

1352
02:18:47,477 --> 02:18:49,877
-l'm taking it to him in the morning. -What's it say?

1353
02:18:50,447 --> 02:18:53,382
-Mail's private, you know that. -What does it say?

1354
02:18:54,852 --> 02:18:56,581
lt says it's over.

1355
02:18:56,954 --> 02:18:58,683
lt says we quit.

1356
02:18:59,857 --> 02:19:01,757
lt says you quit!

1357
02:19:02,392 --> 02:19:03,484
What about the oath?

1358
02:19:03,694 --> 02:19:05,423
Tell me something, Ford.

1359
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:08,621
How much mail can a dead postman deliver?

1360
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:11,164
lt's over.

1361
02:19:16,139 --> 02:19:17,401
Then l'll take it.

1362
02:19:17,975 --> 02:19:19,374
l can't trust you.

1363
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:29,213
lf this is the end...

1364
02:19:30,954 --> 02:19:34,014
...if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered...

1365
02:19:36,627 --> 02:19:38,094
...l'll take it.

1366
02:19:40,063 --> 02:19:43,328
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford, probably dies for it.

1367
02:19:43,767 --> 02:19:45,894
l'm still a postman!

1368
02:19:49,373 --> 02:19:50,237
You owe it to me.

1369
02:19:52,242 --> 02:19:53,072
l owe it to me.

1370
02:20:08,926 --> 02:20:10,655
It's not Ford's fault.

1371
02:20:11,194 --> 02:20:14,960
He's not like you. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do.

1372
02:20:16,166 --> 02:20:17,793
This is all they have.

1373
02:20:18,669 --> 02:20:21,103
-lt's the only decent thing they know. -What?

1374
02:20:21,305 --> 02:20:22,704
Being a postman?

1375
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:26,038
lt's all bullshit, Abby.

1376
02:20:26,243 --> 02:20:27,403
All of it.

1377
02:20:28,278 --> 02:20:31,213
l took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm.

1378
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:34,414
l made up the rest to stay fed.

1379
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:36,178
There is no...

1380
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:38,980
...Restored United States.

1381
02:20:39,923 --> 02:20:41,652
l figured it was something like that.

1382
02:20:41,858 --> 02:20:43,826
l'm going to Saint Rose.

1383
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:45,858
l'm taking you with me.

1384
02:20:46,697 --> 02:20:48,562
l've already packed your horse.

1385
02:20:49,466 --> 02:20:51,593
l know you don't want to hear it...

1386
02:20:52,369 --> 02:20:54,667
...but that's my child inside you.

1387
02:20:55,539 --> 02:20:57,564
l want to see it born somewhere safe.

1388
02:21:21,164 --> 02:21:22,995
l thought l recognized you.

1389
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,994
General Bethlehem said you should be on your knees when l do this.

1390
02:21:27,437 --> 02:21:29,337
l don't give a damn what that asshole said.

1391
02:21:30,474 --> 02:21:32,169
The general is a great man!

1392
02:21:36,747 --> 02:21:38,977
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1393
02:21:44,354 --> 02:21:45,912
You want to see a man?

1394
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,356
That's a man.

1395
02:21:52,529 --> 02:21:53,621
You ready?

1396
02:21:57,968 --> 02:21:59,128
Yes.

1397
02:22:02,739 --> 02:22:05,037
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1398
02:22:06,109 --> 02:22:07,406
l've seen it.

1399
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:13,541
''To Bethlehem.

1400
02:22:14,518 --> 02:22:16,486
This letter is my testimony...

1401
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,520
...to the fact that there is no...

1402
02:22:19,723 --> 02:22:21,884
...Restored United States...

1403
02:22:22,192 --> 02:22:24,387
...and there is no postal service.''

1404
02:22:26,029 --> 02:22:27,496
He expects me to believe this?

1405
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:28,627
lt's true.

1406
02:22:33,136 --> 02:22:35,331
l was there. He disbanded the carriers...

1407
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,073
...and rode west.

1408
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:39,205
Traitor!

1409
02:22:42,145 --> 02:22:43,134
Then l've won.

1410
02:22:50,053 --> 02:22:52,487
Bring the one we found yesterday. They can die together.

1411
02:22:53,757 --> 02:22:55,088
You traitor! You're a traitor!

1412
02:23:02,299 --> 02:23:04,358
That one's the second-in-command.

1413
02:23:04,568 --> 02:23:06,763
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1414
02:23:10,273 --> 02:23:11,763
l was thinking, sir...

1415
02:23:13,343 --> 02:23:16,335
...he might be more valuable to us as a prisoner.

1416
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:19,640
You were supposed to kill him...

1417
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:20,976
...weren't you?

1418
02:23:22,385 --> 02:23:24,216
l couldn't get close enough.

1419
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,500
Who are you?

1420
02:23:47,544 --> 02:23:49,171
My name's Clark.

1421
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:52,212
Postal Carrier for the Restored Republic of California.

1422
02:23:52,816 --> 02:23:53,874
Who are you?

1423
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:02,615
Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1424
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:12,530
lt's an honor.

1425
02:24:16,106 --> 02:24:16,970
Wait!

1426
02:24:19,176 --> 02:24:21,303
Wait a minute. Hold your fire.

1427
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:27,940
You two don't know each other?

1428
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:38,488
This'll never be over.

1429
02:24:39,095 --> 02:24:40,585
lt'll go on.

1430
02:24:42,165 --> 02:24:44,690
Except l'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.

1431
02:24:45,669 --> 02:24:48,229
-Should we fire, sir? -No, goddamn it!

1432
02:24:49,706 --> 02:24:51,435
l won't fight a ghost.

1433
02:24:53,977 --> 02:24:55,308
Tabula...

1434
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:57,276
...rasa...

1435
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,742
...gentlemen.

1436
02:24:59,716 --> 02:25:01,616
A clean slate.

1437
02:25:02,552 --> 02:25:05,544
l want all mail carriers hunted down.

1438
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:08,823
l want The Postman found.

1439
02:25:09,025 --> 02:25:10,959
l want him dealt with.

1440
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:13,556
Colonel, organize the scouts.

1441
02:25:15,365 --> 02:25:16,559
You said he rode west?

1442
02:25:22,038 --> 02:25:23,903
And this is his second-in-command?

1443
02:25:27,978 --> 02:25:29,138
Yes, sir!

1444
02:25:42,425 --> 02:25:45,690
l'll keep you to bargain with. The Postman is weak that way.

1445
02:26:36,279 --> 02:26:38,213
Set your rifle on the ground!

1446
02:26:38,982 --> 02:26:40,882
Set it on the ground.

1447
02:26:42,485 --> 02:26:44,612
What? This old thing?

1448
02:26:46,256 --> 02:26:47,382
lt isn't even loaded.

1449
02:26:48,725 --> 02:26:50,215
Where are we?

1450
02:26:51,294 --> 02:26:53,262
You're in Bridge City...

1451
02:26:55,198 --> 02:26:57,223
...where we don't allow guns.

1452
02:27:07,777 --> 02:27:09,506
The sentry said you were coming.

1453
02:27:17,554 --> 02:27:19,488
l know you. You're...

1454
02:27:20,056 --> 02:27:20,852
...famous.

1455
02:27:22,625 --> 02:27:24,058
l was once...

1456
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,522
...sort of...

1457
02:27:25,729 --> 02:27:26,991
...kind of.

1458
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,696
Not anymore.

1459
02:27:29,632 --> 02:27:30,428
Looking to cross?

1460
02:27:31,334 --> 02:27:32,562
We will be.

1461
02:27:33,503 --> 02:27:36,438
Right now we'd appreciate some food.

1462
02:27:38,208 --> 02:27:39,505
Okay.

1463
02:27:40,443 --> 02:27:41,910
There are some kids behind us.

1464
02:27:42,112 --> 02:27:43,079
How many?

1465
02:27:43,279 --> 02:27:44,109
3.

1466
02:27:45,014 --> 02:27:46,845
3. Okay.

1467
02:27:49,886 --> 02:27:51,547
Come on in, guys!

1468
02:27:53,923 --> 02:27:55,982
l know you're out there.

1469
02:29:07,831 --> 02:29:10,061
-Wait. Just wait. -What did he want?

1470
02:29:11,835 --> 02:29:13,632
Hold on. He says...

1471
02:29:13,837 --> 02:29:16,032
...he's looking for The Postman.

1472
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:18,598
There's no such thing anymore.

1473
02:29:22,312 --> 02:29:25,145
The man on the horse says there is.

1474
02:29:25,682 --> 02:29:27,513
He thinks he's here.

1475
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:30,078
And he's coming back with friends.

1476
02:29:35,492 --> 02:29:37,426
What's a postman?

1477
02:29:55,278 --> 02:29:56,643
You never heard of a postman?

1478
02:30:34,317 --> 02:30:35,443
Are you The Postman?

1479
02:30:41,224 --> 02:30:42,248
Yeah.

1480
02:30:43,726 --> 02:30:45,455
l heard of you, man.

1481
02:30:46,362 --> 02:30:47,795
You're famous.

1482
02:30:49,766 --> 02:30:51,495
Yeah, l guess l am.

1483
02:30:53,202 --> 02:30:54,931
And all of a sudden, l'm not...

1484
02:30:55,438 --> 02:30:57,406
...wearing the right clothes.

1485
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:14,185
Man, you're going to love this!

1486
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:17,287
Open that second chute, bro!

1487
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:36,174
You have a gift, Postman.

1488
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:40,180
l saw it back in Pineview.

1489
02:31:42,652 --> 02:31:45,519
You've given us all back what we'd forgotten.

1490
02:31:47,423 --> 02:31:50,449
You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again.

1491
02:31:52,195 --> 02:31:55,790
You made Ford feel like he was part of the world.

1492
02:31:58,735 --> 02:32:01,169
You give out hope like it was...

1493
02:32:01,371 --> 02:32:03,339
...candy in your pocket.

1494
02:32:19,455 --> 02:32:20,820
Remember this?

1495
02:32:22,558 --> 02:32:23,957
l remember.

1496
02:32:25,561 --> 02:32:28,428
l always like to think that you left it on purpose.

1497
02:32:34,103 --> 02:32:36,128
This is hard for me.

1498
02:32:40,576 --> 02:32:43,670
Michael was the best man l ever knew.

1499
02:32:46,382 --> 02:32:49,977
l never thought there'd be another man l could love the way l loved him.

1500
02:32:53,856 --> 02:32:56,518
l couldn't see it for so long.

1501
02:32:59,162 --> 02:33:00,993
And now you're leaving.

1502
02:33:05,501 --> 02:33:06,627
And l'm afraid.

1503
02:33:10,206 --> 02:33:12,766
l'm afraid you'll never find your Saint Rose.

1504
02:33:13,543 --> 02:33:14,407
lt's not important.

1505
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:17,340
l'm afraid you'll never see your baby.

1506
02:33:45,575 --> 02:33:49,409
l need full power, man! This dude's got a long way to go!

1507
02:33:54,317 --> 02:33:56,376
This thing's working perfect, man!

1508
02:34:08,331 --> 02:34:10,356
A lot higher than it looks, huh?

1509
02:34:20,409 --> 02:34:21,842
You nearly went.

1510
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:25,339
Get in.

1511
02:34:27,016 --> 02:34:29,644
There's 3 good-sized towns up ahead...

1512
02:34:29,852 --> 02:34:33,447
...with enough people to help you if you can convince them to come.

1513
02:34:36,993 --> 02:34:38,756
Don't tell anybody...

1514
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:42,226
...l like to ride this damn thing just for the hell of it.

1515
02:34:42,431 --> 02:34:45,696
Being a city official has its perks, you know?

1516
02:34:53,709 --> 02:34:57,440
Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster.

1517
02:35:03,052 --> 02:35:04,246
How do l stop?

1518
02:35:04,754 --> 02:35:07,018
Quit worrying about the little things.

1519
02:35:07,223 --> 02:35:09,214
Good luck, and Godspeed.

1520
02:35:25,408 --> 02:35:27,467
Reporting for duty, sir!

1521
02:35:27,677 --> 02:35:29,304
-Know what to do? -Talk to the people.

1522
02:35:29,846 --> 02:35:31,211
Tell them it's important.

1523
02:35:31,414 --> 02:35:32,745
Tell them we can make a difference.

1524
02:35:33,816 --> 02:35:37,308
''Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...

1525
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,852
...or close the wall with our dead!

1526
02:35:40,223 --> 02:35:44,250
In peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility.

1527
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:47,258
But when the blast of war blows in our ears...

1528
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:49,590
...then imitate the action of the tiger.

1529
02:35:49,799 --> 02:35:54,099
Summon up the blood. Disguise fair nature with rage...

1530
02:35:54,303 --> 02:35:57,466
...and lend the eye a terrible aspect. ''

1531
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,440
-Who are they? -l don't know.

1532
02:36:42,652 --> 02:36:45,780
Looks like mostly women and young people to me.

1533
02:36:45,988 --> 02:36:47,114
How many?

1534
02:36:47,556 --> 02:36:48,818
lt's an army.

1535
02:36:59,635 --> 02:37:01,125
At last...

1536
02:37:01,437 --> 02:37:04,998
...someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.

1537
02:37:09,512 --> 02:37:11,002
Reckoning, gentlemen!

1538
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:06,930
They're an eager-looking bunch!

1539
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:37,594
Morale is a dangerous thing.

1540
02:38:39,568 --> 02:38:41,399
Bring up the prisoner!

1541
02:38:42,038 --> 02:38:43,938
We'll show them how this game is played.

1542
02:39:26,415 --> 02:39:27,712
Stay here.

1543
02:39:42,298 --> 02:39:43,322
ls he surrendering?

1544
02:39:43,799 --> 02:39:45,528
God, l hope not.

1545
02:40:07,423 --> 02:40:09,050
My little shipping clerk.

1546
02:40:09,658 --> 02:40:11,489
Mr. copy-machine salesman.

1547
02:40:12,761 --> 02:40:14,592
We're both a couple of frauds.

1548
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:18,161
So be it.

1549
02:40:19,535 --> 02:40:23,096
But great men are made by other great men.

1550
02:40:23,706 --> 02:40:24,968
Patton had Rommel.

1551
02:40:25,574 --> 02:40:27,599
Grant had Lee.

1552
02:40:28,344 --> 02:40:29,311
But l get you.

1553
02:40:30,045 --> 02:40:31,478
You're no general.

1554
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:33,980
You're not even a good painter.

1555
02:40:36,452 --> 02:40:38,044
Trying to goad me into a fight?

1556
02:40:38,254 --> 02:40:41,951
lt'd be great if wars were fought just by the assholes who started them.

1557
02:40:43,792 --> 02:40:45,282
We could settle this right here...

1558
02:40:46,529 --> 02:40:47,791
...you and me.

1559
02:40:49,798 --> 02:40:51,857
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

1560
02:40:52,067 --> 02:40:53,830
But it does in your army.

1561
02:40:54,803 --> 02:40:56,828
l invoke Law Seven...

1562
02:40:57,506 --> 02:40:58,598
...of the Laws of Eight!

1563
02:41:00,643 --> 02:41:04,602
''Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!''

1564
02:41:04,813 --> 02:41:05,643
l challenge you.

1565
02:41:05,848 --> 02:41:10,148
You're not a Holnist. You're not a member. You don't have the right.

1566
02:41:10,352 --> 02:41:12,149
l have every right!

1567
02:41:18,093 --> 02:41:19,458
l invoke Law Seven.

1568
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,828
Where...?

1569
02:41:45,221 --> 02:41:46,483
l challenge...

1570
02:41:46,689 --> 02:41:48,452
...for leadership of the clan!

1571
02:41:48,657 --> 02:41:50,284
Where do l know you from?

1572
02:41:51,093 --> 02:41:52,651
''Cry havoc...

1573
02:41:53,062 --> 02:41:55,155
...and let slip the dogs of war!''

1574
02:41:56,332 --> 02:41:57,458
You remember that?

1575
02:41:59,935 --> 02:42:01,300
Shakespeare.

1576
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:04,301
The one who didn't want to fight.

1577
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:08,535
l should have found a way to kill you then, but you seemed so strong.

1578
02:42:10,279 --> 02:42:11,507
Law Seven...

1579
02:42:12,848 --> 02:42:14,008
...it is!

1580
02:42:15,117 --> 02:42:17,051
This war is settled here!

1581
02:43:44,139 --> 02:43:45,800
l studied people.

1582
02:43:47,276 --> 02:43:49,210
l know your problem.

1583
02:43:49,878 --> 02:43:51,140
Do you know...

1584
02:43:51,347 --> 02:43:53,372
...why you can't fight?

1585
02:43:55,584 --> 02:43:58,815
Because you have nothing to fight for.

1586
02:44:01,523 --> 02:44:03,491
You don't care about anything.

1587
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:07,222
You don't value anything.

1588
02:44:07,696 --> 02:44:10,426
You don't believe in anything!

1589
02:44:10,632 --> 02:44:12,759
And that's what makes me better.

1590
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:16,469
l believe...

1591
02:44:17,206 --> 02:44:19,299
...in the United States.

1592
02:44:58,947 --> 02:45:01,882
lt doesn't have to be this way.

1593
02:45:02,818 --> 02:45:05,048
We don't have to kill each other.

1594
02:45:07,423 --> 02:45:08,981
''Law Three:

1595
02:45:09,625 --> 02:45:10,853
Mercy...

1596
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:12,750
...is for the weak.''

1597
02:45:12,961 --> 02:45:14,519
Ford, don't!

1598
02:45:14,797 --> 02:45:16,196
''Law Eight:

1599
02:45:16,598 --> 02:45:18,998
There's only one penalty...

1600
02:45:19,835 --> 02:45:22,030
...and that penalty is death.''

1601
02:45:27,843 --> 02:45:29,367
He isn't worth it.

1602
02:45:33,115 --> 02:45:35,140
l'm the head of the clan now!

1603
02:45:37,352 --> 02:45:39,081
There are going to be new laws!

1604
02:45:40,556 --> 02:45:41,921
Law One:

1605
02:45:43,725 --> 02:45:45,192
No more killing.

1606
02:45:46,094 --> 02:45:48,187
There's going to be peace!

1607
02:46:06,081 --> 02:46:08,072
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury?

1608
02:46:14,423 --> 02:46:15,754
Be a leader, Ford.

1609
02:46:19,094 --> 02:46:20,561
Law Eight:

1610
02:46:25,534 --> 02:46:26,865
Live...

1611
02:46:27,069 --> 02:46:28,627
...and let live.

1612
02:47:53,121 --> 02:47:55,021
Your daddy wrote to tell you...

1613
02:47:55,223 --> 02:47:57,919
...he'll be here as soon as he can...

1614
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:00,685
...and that he loves you very much.

1615
02:48:08,637 --> 02:48:10,070
Mail's slow.

1616
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:13,631
l'm going to have to see about that.

1617
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:47,531
Your daughter.

1618
02:48:49,711 --> 02:48:51,770
Her name is Hope.

1619
02:49:22,577 --> 02:49:24,841
My father saw how fragile we are...

1620
02:49:25,047 --> 02:49:28,483
...and how quickly we fell into the hands of tyranny.

1621
02:49:29,451 --> 02:49:31,214
He saw that ordinary men...

1622
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:34,719
...could reach deep within themselves and find courage.

1623
02:49:35,090 --> 02:49:38,753
He saw that if we began to communicate as a nation...

1624
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,860
...we could become strong again...

1625
02:49:41,063 --> 02:49:42,325
...united.

1626
02:49:43,065 --> 02:49:45,431
But he never did see Saint Rose.

1627
02:49:47,002 --> 02:49:48,333
He said...

1628
02:49:49,004 --> 02:49:50,995
...there was too much to be done.

1629
02:49:52,641 --> 02:49:54,131
He'd made a promise.

1630
02:49:54,676 --> 02:49:57,804
And in keeping it, he traded one dream for another.

1631
02:49:58,447 --> 02:50:00,005
With no regrets.

1632
02:50:03,552 --> 02:50:05,952
And so, in honor of my father....

1633
02:50:44,793 --> 02:50:46,454
That was me.
