3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,962
这是战争前的地球
Earth, before the war.

4
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,717
这是我出生前的纽约
New York, before I was born.

5
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,847
这个地方我只从照片上看到过
A place I've only seen pictures of.

6
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,598
我认识你...
I know you...

7
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,726
可我们从未见过
but we've never met.

8
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,770
我和你心心相映...
I'm with you...

9
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,315
却连你的名字都不知道
but I don't know your name.

10
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,780
我一定是在做梦 可又如此真实
I know I'm dreaming. But it feels like more than that.

11
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,743
就好像是在回忆过往
It feels like a memory.

12
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,080
怎么会这样?
How can that be?

13
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:32,177
2077年3月14日
March 14th, 2077.

14
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:35,388
自强制消除记忆以来 已经过去了5年
Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.

15
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,516
而我仍受这些梦境的困扰
And I'm still haunted by these dreams.

16
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,980
维多利亚和我被安排一起任务
Victoria and I were assigned together.

17
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:48,485
两周后 这里的任务即将完成 我们会与其他人会合
In two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll join the others.

18
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,155
可她不明白我的疑问
But the questions I ask, she doesn't.

19
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,325
也不明白我在思考的问题
The things I wonder about, she won't.

20
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,371
外星掠夺者毁坏月球已是半个世纪以前的事情
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.

21
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:05,001
被迫离开自己即将灭亡星球的他们 来侵略我们的家园
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.

22
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,338
月球毁灭之后 地球陷入混乱
Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.

23
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,840
地震于数小时内倾覆了诸多城市
Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.

24
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,302
海啸帮地震做了扫尾工作
Tsunamis wiped out what remained.

25
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,513
接着就是入侵开始
Then came the invasion.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,682
我们做了该做的事
We did what we had to do.

27
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,268
我们发射了核弹
We used the nukes.

28
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:27,440
我们赢得了战争 却输掉了地球
We won the war, but lost the planet.

29
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,653
使之饱受污染荼毒 大部分地区已不适宜居住
Left it contaminated. Most of it uninhabitable.

30
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,658
残存的人类不得不逃离地球
What remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.

31
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,829
我们建成了指挥中心泰特
We built the Tet, our mission control.

32
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,374
作为移民土星最大卫星泰坦星之前的
A temporary space station before the migration to Titan,

33
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,543
临时空间站
Saturn's largest moon.

34
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,294
所有人都已去了泰坦星
Everyone's there now.

35
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,923
几乎所有人
Well, almost everyone.

36
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:56,636
维卡和我在任务结束之前 都要恪守本职
Until our tour is complete, Vika and I do our job.

37
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:58,388
我们的任务是保护水电装置
We protect the hydro rigs,

38
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,473
这一装置能将地球上的海洋水体
which convert Earth's sea water

39
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,559
转化成供新殖民地使用的聚变能
into fusion energy for the new colony.

40
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,144
人类的生存全赖于此
The survival of humanity depends on it.

41
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,734
谢谢你的咖啡
Thank you for the coffee.

42
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,947
外星掠夺者的残余部队不断进行破坏
Remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation.

43
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,533
它们夜袭我们的无人机
They attack our drones at night,

44
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,910
白天则要置我于死地
and try to kill me during the day.

45
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,247
他们仍在战斗 可我不明就里
There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.

46
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,167
任务指挥中心说我们做得很好
Mission says we have done well.

47
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,005
说我们是最佳组合
That we are an effective team.

48
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,183
维卡是我的导航官
Vika's my communications officer.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,352
她关注着我的一举一动
She keeps an eye on me.

50
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,188
我负责无人机维护
I handle drone maintenance.

51
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,275
而无人机则保护着一切
The drones watch everything.

52
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:57,113
维卡迫不及待要离开 我还在徘徊
Vika can't wait to go. Me, I'm not so sure.

53
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,117
虽然发生了这么多事
I can't shake the feeling that Earth,

54
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,411
我仍然无法甩掉那种感觉...
in spite of all that's happened...

55
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,164
觉得地球仍然是我的家园
Earth is still my home.

56
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:30,664
片名: 遗落战境

57
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,858

Can you plug that hole with Drone 109?

Negative, 109 is in the dock. Still waiting for parts.

100
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,501
现在就不至于这么狼狈了
we wouldn't be running a skeleton crew down here.

117
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,136

现场有多只外星掠夺者的残骸

121
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,074
166号无人机拼死顽抗
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.

122
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,327

未发现外星掠夺者
No sign of scavenger activity.

124
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,416
杰克 指挥中心角度较低 我这儿视野有限
But I've got limited visibility, here, Jack, due to low angle of Mission.

125
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,252
明白 我这就着陆

比赛当时就在这里进行

131
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,484
是最后一届超级碗
The last Super Bowl.

132
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,131
不会是经典赛事吧
Please don't tell me it was a classic.

133
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,779
是经典赛事
A classic game.

134
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,157

Seconds left on the clock.

138
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,961
球被紧紧盯防
The ball is snapped,

139
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,213
四分卫失球
and the QB fumbles.

140
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,717
悲剧
Disaster.

141
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,636
比赛似乎已成定局
Looks like the game is over.

142
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,181
中央核心完全偏转
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.

143
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,350
你那儿没有称手的工具
You don't have the necessary tools down there.

144
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,277
光替换新的燃料电池是修不好的
And a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.

145
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,358
但四分卫跑了回来 捡起他失掉的球
But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.

146
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,725
等等 你刚才干嘛了?
Hold on, what did you just do?

147
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,404
对方中后卫球员排成人墙逼近
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.

148
00:10:55,323 --> 00:11:00,202
于是他来了个长传 连接球手是谁都不知道
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.

149
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,038
圣母玛利亚啊
A Hail Mary.

150
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,125
8万观众都站了起来
Eighty-thousand people on their feet,

151
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,419
看着这个球划过天空
watching this ball sail through the air.

152
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:15,384
位于前场的是一个三流的菜鸟外接员
Downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.

153
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,054
他从人墙后奋勇而出
He just leaps out of the pack.

154
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,599
触地得分!
Touchdown!

155
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:40,701
警报

156
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,786
有敌人! 西面有敌人!
Contact! West contact!

157
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,540
杰克?
Jack?

158
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,250
没事 维卡
It's okay, Vika.

159
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,087
不过是条狗
It's just a dog.

160
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,345
嘿
Hey.

161
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,889
好了 走吧 离开这儿
Now, go on. You gotta get out of here.

162
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,266
快走啊!
Go on, get!

163
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,560
离开这儿! 快跑!
Get out of here! Go!

164
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,779
49号技术员 杰克・哈珀
Tech-49, Jack Harper.

165
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,779
安全

166
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,779
安全

167
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,724
连句谢谢也不说
You're welcome.

168
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,772
166号恢复运转
166 is back online.

169
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,576
今天有两架无人机被干掉 一个月内就有十个燃料电池被偷
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.

170
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,995
那些外星掠夺者越来越明目张胆了
These scavs are getting bolder.

171
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,363
不过水电装置正在提取水源
Well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.

172
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,417
一旦我们离开 他们就只有辐射和尘埃了
Once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.

173
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,836
这太扯了
This is bullshit.

174
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,838
我们明明赢了战争
We won the war.

175
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,507
现在却不得不离开
Now we have to leave.

176
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,511
就剩两周了 杰克
Two more weeks, Jack.

177
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,514
之后我们就能去泰坦星了
Then we'll be on our way to Titan.

178
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,850
没错
Yep.

179
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,479
那个无人机肯定在这里
That drone is out there somewhere.

180
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,024
我们只要找到就行
We just have to find it.

181
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,527
要是没有指挥塔指引的话 就像大海捞针
Without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.

182
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,205
那我们就动身去找吧
So we go to our ground game.

183
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,643
指挥塔 我找到172号了 
Tower, I've located 172

184
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,563
在深坑下面
down a sinkhole.

185
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,815
看不见 但能听到声音
No visual, but I can hear it.

186
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,067
泰特的角度不好 我这里看不到你
Tet's so far off angle, I can barely see you.

187
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,444
情况怎样?
How's it look?

188
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,407
还行 地面上没有外星掠夺者活动的痕迹
It's good, it's good. There's no sign of scav activity on top.

189
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,618
泰特15分钟后离线
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.

190
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,496
之后就靠你自己了
After that, you're on your own.

191
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,016
指挥中心 这里是第49号指挥塔
Mission, this is Tower 49.

192
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,354
杰克已经定位172号无人机 现在正前去维修
Jack has located Drone 172. Engaged in recovery now.

193
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,940
请求尽快提供支援
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.

194
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,013
我看到172号无人机了
I've got a visual on Drone 172.

195
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,057
杰克?
Jack?

196
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,750
这是什么?
What the hell?

197
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,380
该死
Shit.

198
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,354
哈!
Ha!

199
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,189
杰克!
Jack!

200
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,264
49号技术员 杰克・哈珀
Tech-49, Jack Harper.

201
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,603
杰克・哈珀 49号技术员!
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

202
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,147
嘿!
Hey!

203
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,528
不
Oh, no.

204
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,951
该死 我的车呢!
Come on. Not my goddamn bike!

205
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,102
"有什么比与厄运抗争而死 更死得其所"
"How can a man die better. Than facing fearful odds."

206
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,355
"为了寻找先祖的遗迹 以及其信仰的殿堂"
"For the ashes of his fathers. And the temples of his Gods."

207
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:36,732
杰克?
Jack?

208
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,527
好 我马上过去
Yep, I'll be right there.

209
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,527
古罗马之歌

210
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,713
109号情况怎样?
How does 109 look?

211
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,881
能飞吗?
Can it fly?

212
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,716
飞不了
Barely.

213
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,428
而且没有装甲 她就是个瓮中之鳖
And without armor, she's a sitting duck.

214
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,598
我明早跟萨利说装甲配件的事
Well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.

215
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,807
好的
Okay.

216
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:11,892
再说一遍
Again.

217
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,192
怎么了 杰克・哈珀?
What, Jack Harper?

218
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,659
你从哪弄到的?
Where did you get this?

219
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,203
就长在...
It was growing in...

220
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,636
好了 杰克 你很清楚规定
Come on, Jack, you know the regulations.

221
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,970
你知道你觉得我很固执
I know you think I'm a stickler

222
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,347
但你并不知道这里面
but you have no idea what kind of toxins

223
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,474
会有什么样的毒素
could be in something like that.

224
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,184
只是朵花 维卡
It's a flower, Vika.

225
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,477
没错 但那不是重点
Yeah, that's not the point.

226
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,668
我们马上就熬到头了
It's that we are so close to the end,

227
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,565
我可不允许你干傻事毁了它
and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.

228
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,069
好吧
Okay.

229
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,741
每天你都要下去
Every day, you have to go down there

230
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,578
检查丢了些什么
and see what was lost.

231
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,207
但我们已经完成任务了 杰克
But we've done our job, Jack.

232
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,879
是时候离开了
It's time to go.

233
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,097
我觉得他们今天并没有打算杀我
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.

234
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,182
那些外星掠夺者
The scavs.

235
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,148
他们只是想要抓住我
They were trying to catch me.

236
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,446
他们抓不了你
Well, they can't have you.

237
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,047
过来
Come on.

238
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:06,107
我们走之前 你应该跟我一起下去几次
You should come with me sometime, before we leave.

239
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:11,238
我发现了个好地方 想带你看看
There's a place I found I'd like to show you.

240
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,369
我有东西给你看
I'll show you something.

241
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,914
嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey!

242
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,998
天啊
Oh, my God.

243
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,718
这次是水电装置中心发生六级垮塌
It was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.

244
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,511
装置已经彻底报废了
It's offline permanently.

245
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,431
第49号指挥塔 你让整个任务都面临危险
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.

246
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,683
我要知道到底发生了什么事
I need to know exactly what happened.

247
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,561
杰克认为是外星掠夺者将偷走的一个燃料电池做成武器
Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells

248
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,772
然后放进了装置
and got it into the suction.

249
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,357
指挥塔 等一下
Tower, hold.

250
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:16,071
指挥塔 我收到了从37区里发出的信号 你看到了吗?
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37. Are you seeing this?

251
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,572
是的
Yes.

252
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,366
应该是外星掠夺者
It's gotta be scav.

253
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,576
不是我们的信号
It's not one of ours.

254
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:25,705
杰克 信号被定向至星外的
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.

255
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,749
马上赶到
On my way.

256
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:33,088
指挥塔 我们的记录显示你还丢失了九个的燃料电池
Tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.

257
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,255
你能确认吗?
Can you confirm?

258
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,466
不对 指挥中心 是10个
Negative, Mission, that number is 10.

259
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,052
172号无人机昨晚不见了
Drone 172 was lost last night.

260
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,098
只要我们有了装甲配件 109号就能投入战斗
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.

261
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,308
我们能用无人机修好陆地上剩下的水电装置
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.

262
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,434
我已经运行数据了
I've run the numbers.

263
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,436
数据由我们来运行 指挥塔
We'll do the numbers up here, Tower.

264
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,022
我正在给无人机发布防御任务
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.

265
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,522
明白
Copy.

266
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,111
我们的工作是运行那些水电装置 你们的任务就是保护它们
Our job is to run those rigs. Your directive is to protect them.

267
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,948
我们不能再失去其它装置了 你明白吗?
We cannot afford to lose another. Do you copy?

268
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,141
明白
Copy.

269
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,284
你和J杰克还是最佳组合吗?
Are you and Jack an effective team?

270
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,577
我们当然是
Damn right we are.

271
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,464
杰克?
Jack?

272
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,134
你就在正上方 看到什么了吗?
You're right on top of it. Do you have a visual?

273
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,470
杰克?
Jack?

274
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,722
是 我看到了
Yeah, I got it.

275
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,914
他们有一个类似转发器的东西
They have some kind of a repeater.

276
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:17,502
那些外星掠夺者用这座建筑做天线
The scavs are using the building as an antenna.

277
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,670
你能破解吗?
Can you decrypt?

278
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,051
这是一组坐标
It's a set of coordinates.

279
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,262
17区
Grid 17.

280
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,389
是个该死的导航信号
It's a goddamn homing beacon.

281
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,765
17区
Grid 17.

282
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,350
那里有些什么?
What the hell is out there?

283
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,189
没有 什么都没有
Nothing. It's the middle of nowhere.

284
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,109
怎么了?
What is going on?

285
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:45,405
为什么这些外星掠夺者把信号发到外星 杰克?
Why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?

286
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,658
我来关闭它
I'm shutting it down.

287
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:04,465
49号技术员 检查你的路径 你前面就是边界了
Tech-49, check your course. You're headed right for the border.

288
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,137
辐射会在你意识到之前就把你烤熟的
That radiation will cook you from the inside before you know it.

289
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,264
没事 维卡 我看到了
It's okay, Vika. I see it.

290
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,729
我回家之前会在边界巡逻一遍
I'm gonna do a perimeter check before I head home.

291
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,232
可能通讯会断
I may go off-comm.

292
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,639
杰克 我们应该保持联系
Jack, we should keep in contact.

293
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:23,932
至少让我知道你在哪
Just let me know where you are.

294
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,071
明白吗?
Do you copy?

295
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,116
杰克 你明白吗?
Jack, do you copy?

296
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,001
就是这样 鲍伯
That's right, Bob.

297
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,503
你知道我们要去哪
You know where we're going.

298
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,398
你会想我吗?
Are you gonna miss me?

299
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,784
我会想念这个地方的
I'm gonna miss this place.

300
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,329
本来可以很美好的
It would have been great.

301
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,964
本来可以很美好的
It would have been great.

302
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,697
维卡? 维卡 你收到了吗?
Vika? Vika, did you get that?

303
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,366
杰克 你去哪了?
Jack, where have you been?

304
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,493
有不明飞行物坠落在17区
An object came down in 17.

305
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,953
那就是信号坐标
That's the beacon coordinates.

306
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,079
没错
Exactly.

307
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,997
我看到了 有点像容器
I saw it. Some sort of vessel.

308
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,541
杰克 指挥中心快离线了
Jack, Mission's almost offline.

309
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,376
我在路上了
I'm en route now.

310
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,712
指挥中心 我们发现不明飞行物降落在17区
Mission, we have an unidentified object impact in 17.

311
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,048
降落位置正是外星掠夺者发出的信号坐标
It came down at coordinates sent by a scav beacon.

312
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,216
我的技术员已经在路上
My tech's en route now.

313
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,552
指挥塔 我们马上就要离线
Tower, we're going offline soon,

314
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:19,846
但是无人机已经过去执行任务了
but drones are already mobile and executing.

315
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,722
让你的技术员撤退
Have your tech stand down.

316
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,852
杰克 指挥中心让你撤退 无人机会解决他们
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down. The drones will handle it.

317
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,645
否认 指挥塔
That's a negative, Tower.

318
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:30,064
没有泰特在线 我们更得看着这里
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.

319
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,066
我要知道这片区域是安全的
I want to know this site is secure.

320
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,475
萨利 我的技术员担心区域的安全问题
Sally, my tech's concerned about the security of the site.

321
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,866
指挥塔 你们今天失去的资源已经够多了
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.

322
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,993
让你的技术员离开那里 明白吗?
Keep your tech out of there. Do you copy?

323
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,411
明白 指挥官 我...
Copy, Command, I'm...

324
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,919
杰克 指挥官命令你撤退 无人机会解决问题
Jack, Command wants you to stand down. The drones will handle this.

325
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,671
我已经到了
I'm on site.

326
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,089
杰克
Jack.

327
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,925
我看不到你 指挥中心离线了
I don't have eyes on you. Command's offline.

328
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,053
维卡 我觉得这是我们的同类
Vika, I think it's one of ours.

329
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,266
这东西很古老 看起来...
This thing is ancient. It looks...

330
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,268
像是战前的
pre-war.

331
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,770
这东西是那些外星掠夺者的杰克
The scavs brought this thing down, Jack.

332
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,230
没有掠夺者的踪迹
There's no sign of scavs.

333
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,773
技术员 我是你的导航官
Technician, this is your Control.

334
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,068
我命令你立即撤离回塔
I'm ordering you to pull out and return to the tower immediately.

335
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,447
准备降落
Touching down.

336
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,778
是人类
They're human.

337
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,746
指挥塔 发现幸存者
Tower, we have got survivors.

338
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,918
有四个... 不 五个幸存者
There are four... Check it, five survivors.

339
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,003
是人类
They are human.

340
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:49,954
住手!
Stand down!

341
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,081
维卡 无人机在向幸存者开火
Vika, the drones are firing on survivors.

342
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:55,751
杰克 指挥中心不在线 我没法控制
Jack, the Tet's offline. I don't have control.

343
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,044
住手!
Stand down!

344
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,638
杰克・哈珀 49号技术员
Jack Harper, Tech-49.

345
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,897
滚开 该死的东西!
Back off, you son of a bitch!

346
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,823
滚开!
Back off!

347
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,308
开门
Open the door.

348
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,187
维卡!
Vika!

349
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,244
拿急救箱来
Get the med kit.

350
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,372
拿急救箱来!
Get the med kit!

351
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,053
这必须上报指挥中心
This has to be reported.

352
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,541
把无人机屠杀我们自己飞船的船员
Be sure and report that the drones

353
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,236
也汇报上去
killed the crew from one of our own ships.

354
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,058
看是哪条规定让它们这么做的
See what Command makes of that.

355
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,152
是呼吸液 吐出来就好了
It's breathing fluid. Just let her get it out.

356
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,539
杰克
Jack.

357
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,610
来 你还脱水呢
Here. You're still dehydrated.

358
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,668
我们在哪?
Where are we?

359
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,421
我是维多利亚 他是杰克
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.

360
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,011
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

361
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,723
我叫茱莉亚
I'm Julia.

362
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,600
茱莉亚...
Julia...

363
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:43,062
我对接下来要告诉你的事深表遗憾
I'm sorry for what I have to tell you,

364
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,272
你的飞船在降落中
but you were in a crash.

365
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,192
坠毁了
Your ship came down.

366
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:51,654
是杰克把你从废墟中救出来
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.

367
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,949
但其他船员都遇难了
But none of your crew survived.

368
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,291
什么意思?
What do you mean?

369
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,835
你是唯一的幸存者
You're the only one that made it.

370
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,548
节哀
I'm sorry.

371
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:22,268
你已经沉睡了很久
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.

372
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,647
有头晕的感觉是正常的
Some disorientation is normal.

373
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,107
多久?
How long?

374
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,154
60年
Sixty years.

375
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,990
至少
At least.

376
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,420
我必须回到飞船上
I have to get back to our ship.

377
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:58,554
下去太危险了 你需要休息
It's too dangerous down there. You need to rest.

378
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:10,190
维卡...
Vika...

379
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,361
别碰我
Don't touch me.

380
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:23,037
你的飞船重新进入地球是由地球表面的灯塔触发
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon from the surface.

381
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,539
你知道事情经过吗?
Do you know anything about that?

382
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:35,883
你的任务是什么?
What was your mission?

383
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,262
这是机密
It's classified.

384
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:41,889
我们对奥德赛号没有任何记录
Well, we have no record of an Odyssey...

385
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:43,223
在拿到飞船飞行记录之前
I can't tell you anything

386
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,067
我无可奉告
until I get the flight recorder from my ship.

387
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:49,229
茱莉亚 很多事在这60年之间都改变了
Julia, a lot has changed in 60 years.

388
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,072
在你深度睡眠期间
While you were in delta sleep,

389
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:00,449
地球遭到袭击
Earth was attacked.

390
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,952
外星掠夺者入侵
Call them scavs.

391
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:09,583
他们摧毁了我们的月球以及地球的一半土地
They destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.

392
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,420
然后入侵地球
Then they invaded.

393
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,089
我们赢了战争
We won the war,

394
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,674
也毁了地球
but Earth was ruined.

395
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,011
所有人都在泰坦星上 就是土卫六
Everyone's on Titan now. It's a moon of Saturn.

396
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:25,432
还有些在空间站理 随时准备撤离
Or on the space station, getting ready to go.

397
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:31,438
我们在这里负责保障无人机的正常运行
We're here for security and drone maintenance.

398
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:35,526
我们是留守人员
We're the mop-up crew.

399
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:58,340
你是去了同伴
You've lost people.

400
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,968
失去了所有
Everything.

401
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,723
如果你想一个人静静 我们可以理解
If you want to be alone, we understand.

402
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:22,489
无人机屠杀了她的所有同伴
The drones killed her entire crew.

403
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,660
如果我不在那...
If I hadn't gotten there...

404
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,370
我想让她马上离开
I want her gone first thing.

405
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:29,913
维卡...
Vika...

406
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,877
你还有任务之前的记忆吗?
Do you have any memories before the mission?

407
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,672
安全消除记忆之前的记忆?
Before the security wipe?

408
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,885
我们的任务是遗忘
Our job is not to remember.

409
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:45,888
记得吗?
Remember?

410
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,182
你记得她吗?
Do you remember her?

411
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,396
杰克
Jack.

412
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:59,359
是掠夺者的信号让她降落的
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.

413
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:03,280
我们不知道她是人
We don't know who she is.

414
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,450
还是鬼
Or what she is.

415
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,705
先睡个安稳觉吧
Let's just get through the night.

416
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,707
好吗?
Okay?

417
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,580
你会开那个?
You fly that thing?

418
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,708
是的
Yes.

419
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,297
现在什么情况?
What happens now?

420
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,760
泰特马上就上线了
The Tet will be online soon.

421
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:10,222
维多利亚会汇报对你的营救行动
Victoria will report your rescue.

422
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,308
他们会派人来
They'll send someone down for you.

423
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,270
泰特派人来?
From the Tet?

424
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:18,272
是的
Yes.

425
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,570
我需要从我的飞船拿到飞行记录
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.

426
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,448
掠夺者都在夜里行动
The scavs, they move at night.

427
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,534
他们现在可能已经占领那里了
They could be all over it by now.

428
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,536
我必须了解发生了什么
I need to know what happened.

429
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:36,915
你也必须了解发生了什么
You need to know what happened.

430
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,627
拜托
Please.

431
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,110
杰克?
Jack?

432
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:07,321
杰克 你在干什么?
Jack, what are you doing?

433
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,780
维卡 她是船长
Vika, she's a flight officer.

434
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:12,200
她想要看飞船上的飞行记录
She wants to see her ship and secure the flight recorder.

435
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,827
你也应该很想看
Now, you would want the same thing.

436
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,662
杰克 我...
Jack, I...

437
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,500
我无法护你周全
I can't protect you.

438
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,838
我理解
No, I understand.

439
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,635
这件事我自己负责
This one's on me.

440
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:13,929
我没办法救他们
I couldn't save them.

441
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,442
杰克 杰克!
Jack. Jack!

442
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:33,573
杰克 你听到我说话吗?
Jack, can you hear me?

443
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,567
好了 该走了
All right, it's time to go.

444
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:10,110
杰克
Jack.

445
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,487
我找到了
I found it.

446
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,709
杰克!
Jack!

447
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:34,194
49号指挥塔 在这个阳光明媚的早上 你们进展如何?
Tower 49, how are y'all this lovely morning?

448
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,947
如在天堂一般
Another day in paradise.

449
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,407
萨利...
Sally...

450
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:45,205
杰克凌晨去巡逻了
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol

451
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:49,000
在17区附近的峡谷
and went off-comm

452
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:54,172
失去了联络
near the canyons in 17.

453
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:57,509
我知道我们无人机不多
Now, I know we're low on drones,

454
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:03,306
不过我们需要一台去检查一下这个区
but, um, requesting one to sweep the area.

455
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:08,395
只是快速扫描一下
Just a quick scout.

456
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:13,650
收到 185号无人机即刻前往22区
Copy 49, tasking 185 to Grid 22.

457
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,937
"有什么比与厄运抗争而死 更死得其所"
"And how can a man die better than facing fearful odds."

458
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,566
"为了寻找先祖的遗迹"
"For the ashes of his fathers."

459
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:57,611
"以及其信仰的殿堂"
"And the temples of his Gods"

460
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,421
我一直在观察你 杰克
I've been watching you, Jack.

461
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,466
你很好奇
You're curious.

462
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,843
你想从那些书中找寻什么?
What are you looking for in those books?

463
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:26,139
它们让你想起了什么吗?
Do they bring back old memories?

464
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,642
你从我这得不到任何东西
You won't get anything from me.

465
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,477
我的记忆已经被抹去以保护...
My memory has been wiped to protect...

466
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:33,563
任务的安全 没错
The security of the mission. Yes.

467
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,025
你那宝贵的记忆
You can't have your precious memory

468
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,444
无法落入敌手了 是吗?
falling into the wrong hands, now, can you?

469
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,238
告诉我
Tell me.

470
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,743
你有没有如此接近过一个掠夺者?
Have you ever met a scav up close?

471
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:52,499
当然没有 你只修理无人机
Of course not. You just repair drones.

472
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,251
"禁止进入辐射区"
"Don't go into the radiation zone."

473
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:59,464
"不要质疑"
"Don't ask too many questions."

474
00:54:59,673 --> 00:55:04,344
超出任务范围
Not part of the job description.

475
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,221
开灯
Lights.

476
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,205
我们不是外星人 杰克
We're not alien, Jack.

477
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,290
我们是人类
We're human.

478
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,461
当然 对于我们而言 作为人类是一个很大的麻烦
Of course, for us, being human is a problem.

479
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:46,845
老式隐形战斗机的技术 保护我们不被你们扫描到
Old stealth fighter tech. Shields us from your scanners.

480
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,847
声音干扰
Vocal scrambling.

481
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,849
能听到我说话吗 杰克?
Can you hear me, Jack?

482
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,686
迷惑你们的无人机
Keeps your drones confused.

483
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,565
当然 至少大部分时间可以
Well, most of the time.

484
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:00,150
无人机是用来...
The drones are programmed...

485
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:01,860
屠杀人类的 杰克
To kill humans, Jack.

486
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,030
你也看到他们屠杀冬眠仓里的人
You saw what they did to those sleep pods.

487
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:09,409
你为了救那个女人 差点被炸成碎片
You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting that woman.

488
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,665
你为什么这么做?
Why did you do that?

489
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,585
任何人都会这么做
Anyone would have.

490
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:19,961
"任何人"
"Anyone."

491
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,630
真有意思
Interesting.

492
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,299
我们这是在浪费时间
We're wasting our time.

493
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,760
无人机会来这儿找他的
The drone will track him here.

494
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,086
这是赛克斯中士
That's Sergeant Sykes.

495
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,390
他觉得我把你带到这里 是愚蠢的行为
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.

496
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:40,356
希望你能证明他错了
I hope you prove him wrong.

497
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,036
长官 我在西部的峡谷里
Mission, I'm picking up a bio trail

498
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,359
发现了生物体痕迹
somewhere near the west canyons.

499
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:55,914
你能帮我确认基因序列吗?
Can you confirm the sequence?

500
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:57,415
稍等一下
Stand by.

501
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,503
基因确定是杰克的
DNA confirmed. It's Jack.

502
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:06,174
维卡 你没事吧?
Vika, are you okay?

503
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,885
你俩之间没什么问题吧?
Everything good between you two?

504
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,470
当然没有
Of course.

505
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:12,972
你们还是最佳组合吗?
You're still an effective team?

506
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,100
我们很好
We're great.

507
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:17,894
比以前都好
Never better.

508
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:20,396
我们当时在跑垒 结果那场比赛我们输了
We were running a ground game, and losing.

509
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,816
大家都在说"到底是怎么回事?"
So, we decided, "What the hell?"

510
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,276
"我们应该来个长传球的"
"We've got to throw the long ball."

511
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,822
我们花了几十年的时间破译全球定位系统的密码
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.

512
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,658
你们就是这样使奥德赛号降落的吧
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.

513
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,411
为什么?
Why?

514
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,041
奥德赛号上的小型反应堆是美国宇航局制造的
The Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.

515
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,752
现在已经很难找到了
Very hard to come by.

516
00:57:44,254 --> 00:57:47,340
你喜欢昨晚的烟火表演吗?
Did you like the show last night?

517
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:53,096
那只是一个燃料电池
That was just one fuel cell.

518
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:56,182
想象一下 十个燃料电池
Imagine what 10 of them will do,

519
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,520
再加上一个武器级别的钚核心 会有多大的威力
with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.

520
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:05,066
我们有核武器 也有无人机来运送它
We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.

521
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:09,195
但我们没法操作它 无人机不能识别我们
But we can't access it. It doesn't know who we are.

522
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:13,825
但是它能识别你 杰克
But it knows you, Jack.

523
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,126
你得帮我们重新给无人机编程
We need you to program the drone.

524
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,880
让它把我们的核武器运到泰特去
Have it carry our nuke up to the Tet.

525
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,137
结束这场战争
End this war.

526
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,809
泰特上有人类
There are people up there.

527
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,104
中士
Sergeant.

528
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,900
设置无人机返回泰特的程序
Program the drone to return to the Tet.

529
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:50,987
它必须降落在正中心的位置
It needs to go right to the center.

530
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,073
别做梦了
Screw you.

531
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:57,911
我们没有时间了
We haven't got time for this.

532
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:24,771
嘿 嘿！
Hey. Hey!

533
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:37,784
不
No.

534
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:45,959
- 我们走!  - 拉他起来
- Let's go!  - Get him up.

535
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,851
长官 185号刚刚从屏幕上消失了
Mission, 185 just went off-grid.

536
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,978
收到 指挥塔 我们也看见了
Copy, Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

537
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:49,689
我请求再派出两架无人机 可以吗?
Permission to task two additional drones?

538
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:54,027
一架无人机出现 其它的就会随之而来
If one drone is here, more will come.

539
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:57,405
他们不找到我就绝不罢休
And they won't stop until they find me.

540
01:00:57,572 --> 01:00:59,866
它们会毁了这里的
They'll turn this place to dust.

541
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,161
但如果你放我们走 我就让它们停下
But if you let us go, I'll call them off.

542
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,834
这是你唯一的机会
It's your only chance.

543
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,851
我去过你们的
I've been to your

544
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,395
"辐射区域"
"radiation zones."

545
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,231
如果你想知道真相
If you're looking for the truth,

546
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:35,902
就去那里找吧
that's where you'll find it.

547
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:53,044
你在拿我们所有人的生命去冒险
You've risked all our lives. Everything.

548
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:56,297
你凭什么就认为他是不一样的?
What makes you think he's different?

549
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,050
因为她
She does.

550
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,870
油量不足

551
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,980
像在天堂一样

552
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:58,985
指挥中心 我在37区找到他了
Mission, I've found my tech over in 37.

553
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,653
可以取消搜索了
You can call off the search.

554
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,322
收到 塔台 真高兴杰克安全了
Copy that, Tower. Glad Jack's safe.

555
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,617
让其它无人机回去保护水电装置吧
Tasking the other drones back to rig support.

556
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:32,351
我们现在要去哪?
Where are we going now?

557
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:35,980
你是谁?
Who are you?

558
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,402
你为什么不告诉我?
What aren't you telling me?

559
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,696
杰克 我...
Jack, I...

560
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,531
你在奥德赛号上干什么?
What were you doing on the Odyssey?

561
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:48,409
你有什么任务?
What was your mission?

562
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:55,249
我的第一个任务是飞往泰坦星的探索飞行
It was a research flight to Titan. My first.

563
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,878
本来应该是这样的
That's what it was supposed to be.

564
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:05,718
出发前六个星期 深层空间探测器发现了一个外星物体
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners picked up an alien object.

565
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,387
我们被派去调查
We were reassigned to investigate.

566
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,473
他们使我们进入了睡眠状态
They put us all in delta.

567
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,560
你和维多利亚一定是先被唤醒了
They must have woken you and Victoria first.

568
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,274
什么?
What?

569
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,401
杰克 那个外星物体
That object

570
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,570
就是泰特
was the Tet, Jack.

571
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,491
我们的任务就是调查泰特
The Tet was our mission.

572
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,955
不可能
That's impossible.

573
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:36,457
绝对不可能!
That's impossible!

574
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,001
你到底是谁?
Who are you?

575
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:44,090
我是你的妻子
I'm your wife.

576
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:53,266
我不知道发生了什么 但你绝不是你所认为的那个人
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.

577
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:04,318
杰克 我们曾经来过这里
Jack, we were here.

578
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:09,699
你让我和你见面 说要带我去这个世界最高的地方
You asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.

579
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:18,124
我记得你那天有点紧张
I could tell you were nervous that day.

580
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:20,960
就是在这里 杰克
It was right here, Jack.

581
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:27,633
你说
You said,

582
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,969
"从这里看过去"
"Look through here,"

583
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:32,513
"就能看到我们的未来"
"And I'll show you the future."

584
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,851
然后我拿出了戒指
And I held up a ring.

585
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:58,831
你说...
And you said...

586
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,541
"我愿意"
"Yes."

587
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,884
你回来了
There you are.

588
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:14,180
你回来了
There you are.

589
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:39,413
嗨
Hi.

590
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,457
你好
Hello.

591
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:45,795
来吧
Come on.

592
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:50,526
维卡 我回来了
Vika, I'm coming in.

593
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:55,906
在我回来之前别向总部汇报 行吗?
Do not report to Mission until I get back. Do you copy?

594
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,242
你听到了吗?
Do you copy?

595
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,678
维卡 开门
Vika, open the door.

596
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:20,014
离我远点
Stay away from me.

597
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,017
我不想听你解释
I don't want to hear it.

598
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,854
这里不安全 我们得离开这里 快
It's not safe here, and we need to leave, now.

599
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,443
你心里一直有她
It was always her.

600
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:36,697
不是吗?
Wasn't it?

601
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,200
维卡...
Vika...

602
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,499
她是我妻子
she's my wife.

603
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:04,683
指挥中心 这里是49号指挥塔
Mission, this is Tower 49.

604
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,185
请讲
Go ahead, 49.

605
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:07,728
别
No.

606
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,314
我和杰克之间出了一些问题
I'm having a problem with my technician.

607
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:12,233
别 你根本不知道你在干什么
No, you don't know what you're doing.

608
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,026
他在坠机点找到一个幸存者
He found a survivor at the crash site.

609
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,233
你得听我的
You've gotta listen to me.

610
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,404
他的工作能力受到了影响
She's impeding his abilities,

611
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,324
无法胜任现在的工作
and he is unfit for service.

612
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:21,784
不 不 不
No, no, no.

613
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:24,662
很遗憾听到这件事 维卡
I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.

614
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,206
你们还是最佳组合吗?
Are you still an effective team?

615
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,291
维卡...
Vika...

616
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:31,168
快点开门啊 维卡!
Open the goddamn door, Vika!

617
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,045
不
No.

618
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,176
我们现在不是最佳组合了
We are not an effective team.

619
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:04,076
维卡 拜托了 我们必须得走了
Vika, please. We have to go now.

620
01:10:04,243 --> 01:10:06,579
我不会跟你去任何地方的 杰克
I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack.

621
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:10,249
我知道一个地方 那里很安全
There's a place I know. We'll be safe.

622
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,543
我要去泰坦星
I'm going to Titan.

623
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:16,213
根本就没有泰坦星
There is no Titan.

624
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:18,340
他们欺骗了我们
They lied to us.

625
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,801
离我远点
Just stay away from me.

626
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:25,222
维卡 求你了 有些事...
Vika, please, there are things...

627
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,432
有些事情你必须知道了
Things you need to know.

628
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:28,434
我不想知道!
I don't want to know!

629
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:33,939
杰克...
Jack...

630
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:17,358
嗨 杰克 真没想到我们还能见面
Hi, Jack. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

631
01:11:18,943 --> 01:11:20,361
你做了什么?
What have you done?

632
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:24,281
你不用太自责 无人机有时候并不可靠
You can't blame yourself for this. Drones are unreliable.

633
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,367
也会出问题
Sometimes things go wrong.

634
01:11:27,368 --> 01:11:29,078
"出问题?"
"Go wrong"?

635
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:33,248
你杀了她
You killed her.

636
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:38,295
我知道 这是个悲剧 她很出色
I know, it's tragic. She was a wonderful person.

637
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:41,632
杰克 我们想带你回来
Jack, we want to bring you in.

638
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,468
我被授权通知你
I've been authorized to tell you

639
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,804
我们要分配给你新的任务
we're going to assign you a new mission.

640
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,847
和幸存者一起
You and the survivor.

641
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:58,649
这里的人对她很感兴趣 把她带来
There's a lot of interest up here. Bring her up.

642
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:02,277
我们可以把一切都调查清楚
We can debrief, then anything's possible.

643
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:05,531
是时候回家了 杰克
It's time to come home, Jack.

644
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,992
杰克?
Jack?

645
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:09,868
杰克?
Jack?

646
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,089
杰克
Jack

647
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,218
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

648
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:40,232
坐稳了
Hang on.

649
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,212
闪电
Lightning.

650
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:03,756
这就是我的计划
That's the plan.

651
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,501
我们需要掩护
We need cover.

652
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:42,628
那里
There.

653
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:31,486
- 你还好吗?  - 不好
- Are you okay?  - No.

654
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:43,916
别担心 我们不会进去的
Don't worry, we're staying out of there.

655
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:54,426
我们要死了吗?
Are we gonna die?

656
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:55,594
不!
No!

657
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:00,349
有可能
Maybe.

658
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:02,601
杰克!
Jack!

659
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,685
该死
Son of a bitch.

660
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:53,777
在这等我
Wait here.

661
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,443
那是谁?
Who is it?

662
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:14,983
嘿!
Hey!

663
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:16,985
等一下!
Wait!

664
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:19,154
等一下!
Wait!

665
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,947
嘿!
Hey!

666
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:40,717
放下武器!
Drop your weapon!

667
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:57,984
没关系的
It's okay.

668
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:02,781
不许动!
Don't move!

669
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:09,287
我们得关了那个无人机
We have to shut that drone down.

670
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:12,457
别动!
Stop moving!

671
01:19:12,624 --> 01:19:13,667
杰克!
Jack!

672
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,068
没事了
It's okay.

673
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:44,382
茱莉亚
Julia.

674
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,345
茱莉亚!
Julia!

675
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:58,772
别
Don't.

676
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:01,399
别碰我
Don't touch me.

677
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:20,210
坚持住
Hold on.

678
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:22,337
要坚持住
Just hold on.

679
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:56,621
杰克・哈珀 52号技术员
Jack Harper, Tech-52.

680
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,651
嘿
Hey.

681
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,527
原来你在这
There you are.

682
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:15,033
发生了什么? 你还好吗?
What happened? Are you okay?

683
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:18,620
那个不明飞行器越过边界 然后就联络不上你了
That bogey came across the border and then I lost you.

684
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:22,499
那是假警报
False alarm.

685
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:28,463
我得回去了
I should get back out there.

686
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,175
你好不容易才回家 连吻我都不肯?
You come all the way home, and I don't get a kiss?

687
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,063
你在想什么?
What's going on up there?

688
01:23:46,356 --> 01:23:48,400
我在想...
I was thinking...

689
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,403
你为什么不和我一起下去?
why don't you come down with me?

690
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,572
一起去地上?
To the surface?

691
01:23:54,823 --> 01:23:56,658
我们现在就可以出发了
We could go right now.

692
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,576
现在?
Now?

693
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:00,495
是
Yeah.

694
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:02,997
没开玩笑吧?
Are you serious?

695
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:05,667
下面发生的一切会让你大吃一惊
You won't believe what's down there.

696
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,923
杰克
Jack.

697
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,718
你知道规定的
You know the regulations.

698
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:17,095
是
Yes.

699
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:22,767
我们别这样了 好吗? 我不想再讨论这些了
Can we not do this again? I'm done talking about it.

700
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:26,354
好
Okay.

701
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:16,863
接下来会有点疼
This is gonna hurt.

702
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:30,335
糟透了 是吧 鲍伯?
Hell of a day, huh, Bob? 

703
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,839
你一直很喜欢这首歌
You always loved this song.

704
01:27:01,885 --> 01:27:03,428
我不是他
I'm not him.

705
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,266
我知道我不是
I know I'm not.

706
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:13,563
但我爱过你...
But I've loved you...

707
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,526
自我有记忆以来
for as long as I can remember.

708
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,405
我不知道还该怎么说
I don't know how else to say it.

709
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:30,413
你记得你曾经和我说过的吗?
You know what you said to me once?

710
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,085
你说 当一切结束以后 你会为我在湖边建一座房子
You said when it was all over, you would build me a house on a lake.

711
01:27:39,047 --> 01:27:42,800
我们会一起变老 变胖
We would grow old and fat together.

712
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,887
我们也会吵架
And we would fight.

713
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:49,432
可能是因为喝多了
Maybe drink too much.

714
01:27:50,308 --> 01:27:52,560
好浪漫
Real romantic.

715
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:59,359
然后我们一起死去
And then we would die

716
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:03,029
葬在湖边的草地
and be buried in a meadow by the lake.

717
01:28:05,782 --> 01:28:08,493
世界会忘了我们
And the world would forget about us.

718
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,083
但我们能一直和对方在一起
But we would always have each other.

719
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:19,587
我记得
I remember.

720
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:24,050
这些记忆是你的 杰克
Those memories are yours, Jack.

721
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,053
是我们的
They're ours.

722
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:30,264
它们是你
They are you.

723
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:33,745
早上好
Good morning.

724
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:42,378
我曾经想下半生都住在这里
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.

725
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:45,506
现在你也可以的
You still can.

726
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,429
我得走了
I have to go.

727
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:54,348
那些人需要我的帮助
Those people need my help.

728
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:03,274
一切结束的时候我们会回来的
We'll come back when it's over.

729
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:06,444
答应我
Promise me.

730
01:30:08,613 --> 01:30:10,698
一切结束的时候我们会回来的
We'll come back when it's over.

731
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,862
你曾经让我很担心
You had me worried for a second.

732
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:53,324
我以为你不会回来了
I thought you weren't coming back.

733
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:58,037
看来我证明他是错的
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

734
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:02,542
你看起来糟透了
You look like shit.

735
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:07,046
你应该去看看另一个我
You should see the other guy.

736
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,965
如果我之前告诉你 你会在那里发现什么
If I had told you what you'd find out there,

737
01:31:09,132 --> 01:31:11,008
你会觉得我疯了
you would have thought I was crazy.

738
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:14,011
我现在也这么觉得
I still do.

739
01:31:15,847 --> 01:31:16,889
马尔科姆・比奇
Malcolm Beech.

740
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:18,391
茱莉亚・哈珀
Julia Harper.

741
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:27,984
跟我来
Come on.

742
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:35,491
指挥中心 在西峡谷附近
Mission, I'm picking up a bio-trail

743
01:31:35,575 --> 01:31:36,815
发现生物痕迹
somewhere near the West Canyons.

744
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:38,703
能否确认序列?
Can you confirm the sequence?

745
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,371
准备确认
Stand by.

746
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:43,749
基因确认 是杰克
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

747
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:47,879
报告 185号失去了信号
Mission, 185 just went off-grid.

748
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:50,339
收到 我也发现了
Copy, Tower. We're seeing the same thing.

749
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:04,729
当罪恶的泰特来的时候 我服役还不到一年
I'd been in the army less than a year when that unholy Tet arrived.

750
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:08,191
我看到月球被毁灭
I saw the moon get taken out.

751
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:10,651
就在夜空里
Right up there in the night sky.

752
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:13,779
我简直不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

753
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:18,201
后来大自然发怒了
After that, nature took over.

754
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:20,828
在芝加哥周围有基岩
There's bedrock around Chicago,

755
01:32:20,995 --> 01:32:25,291
因此我们才能躲过海啸和地震
so we were spared the worst of the waves and the quakes.

756
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:28,961
很多人饿死了
Most people just starved.

757
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:33,674
然后从泰特派来许多运输船
Then the Tet sent troop ships down.

758
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:35,801
门开了
The doors opened,

759
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:39,096
你走了出来
and out you came.

760
01:32:40,473 --> 01:32:42,975
宇航员杰克・哈珀
Astronaut Jack Harper.

761
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,604
数千个你
Thousands of you.

762
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:50,274
记忆清除
Memory wiped.

763
01:32:52,318 --> 01:32:53,778
程序设定为杀人
Programmed to kill.

764
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:58,199
他们让我们中最优秀的一员
They had taken one of our best

765
01:32:58,908 --> 01:33:00,993
来对付我们
and turned him against us.

766
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:05,915
没有灵魂
No soul.

767
01:33:08,209 --> 01:33:09,835
没有人性
No humanity.

768
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,174
泰特
The Tet.

769
01:33:16,509 --> 01:33:18,719
多聪明的机器
What a brilliant machine.

770
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:23,391
吃光了一个又一个星球的能量
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.

771
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:28,187
第二阶段是无人机
Phase Two was drones.

772
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:30,314
技术员
Repairmen.

773
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:36,654
50年来 我们一直看着那些水电装置吸干我们的地球
50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.

774
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,908
然后有一天
Then one day,

775
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,121
我看见你在那里着陆
I saw you set down.

776
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:48,165
需要修理另一个无人机
Another drone to fix.

777
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:53,170
但那天 你在碎石堆里看到了一本书
But in the rubble that day was a book.

778
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:56,966
你捡起那本书
You picked it up.

779
01:33:57,133 --> 01:33:59,385
反复研究
You studied it.

780
01:34:00,845 --> 01:34:04,515
我觉得我找到了一种方法
And I thought I saw a way.

781
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:09,895
当你挡住那架无人机并救了她的时候
When you stepped in front of that drone and saved her,

782
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:12,189
我就知道了
I knew.

783
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:16,193
你就在你身体里的某个地方
You were in there somewhere.

784
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:20,698
我只需要找到一种方法来把你带回来
I just had to find a way to bring you back.

785
01:34:44,555 --> 01:34:46,140
小心 小心
Watch it, watch it.

786
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:48,142
盯着它 小心
Eyes on it. Steady.

787
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,311
给它一点空间
Give it some space.

788
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:52,730
放松 你们让它紧张了
Come on, you're making it nervous.

789
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:58,611
那是一种罪恶的武器
That is one pissed-off weapon.

790
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:02,573
不 这就是个机器
No, it's just a machine.

791
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,953
我是武器
I'm the weapon.

792
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,887
当这玩意爆炸的时候
I would love to be there to see

793
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:27,181
我多想去看看那家伙的表情
that thing's face when this goes off.

794
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,767
那可是一条不归路
That would be a one-way trip.

795
01:35:29,934 --> 01:35:33,396
是啊 但很值得
Yeah, but it would be worth it.

796
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:53,958
欢迎回来 指挥官
Welcome back, Commander.

797
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,749
开门!
Open the doors!

798
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:03,277

快散开!
Spread out!

800
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,537
低头 把头低下!
Head down, keep your head down!

801
01:37:44,902 --> 01:37:45,903
杰克!
Jack!

802
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,239
跟着我!
Follow me!

803
01:38:46,672 --> 01:38:49,133
来吧 你个小杂种!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

804
01:39:50,653 --> 01:39:51,654
嘿!
Hey!

805
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:53,298
杰克
Jack.

806
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:01,473
我没事
I'm okay.

807
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:23,328
那架无人机
The drone.

808
01:41:23,829 --> 01:41:25,622
把那架无人机运出去
Send the drone.

809
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,670
毁了
It's gone.

810
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:35,966
我以为我们成功了
I thought we had it.

811
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:38,719
我真的这么想
I really did.

812
01:41:40,471 --> 01:41:42,681
我自己带炸弹过去
I can take the bomb myself.

813
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,141
啊...
Ah...

814
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:47,644
你明知炸弹会把你像苍蝇一样轰个稀烂吧
You know it will swat you like a fly.

815
01:41:48,145 --> 01:41:49,563
我去就不会这样了
Not if I go.

816
01:41:52,566 --> 01:41:53,817
不行
No.

817
01:41:55,194 --> 01:41:57,529
她要你把我带去
She asked you to bring me up.

818
01:41:59,156 --> 01:42:00,532
照她说的做吧
So bring me up.

819
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:06,371
我们一起去
We'll go together.

820
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:24,056
这幅画让我有种家的感觉
It reminds me of home.

821

准备好了吗?

你不会又开始说足球了吧?
You're not talking about football already, are you?

859

早上很忙吧?

869
01:46:44,775 --> 01:46:47,986
杰克 我发现有第二个乘客

她叫茱莉亚・罗萨科娃

是坠毁飞船的幸存者

指挥中心 出问题了

878
01:47:21,645 --> 01:47:25,649
最后一次启动准确无误 乃是为了静止观察目标
The last burn was spot-on to give us a SO-click hold from object,

879
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,318
但雷达范围仍在不断缩小
but radar range still decreasing.

880
01:47:28,485 --> 01:47:31,279
我们正在向目标加速前进

881
01:47:31,446 --> 01:47:32,989
我们需要全力启动停电系统 抛离目标

882
01:47:33,156 --> 01:47:34,783
- 马上启动  - 输入目标位置

准备好了吗 出发

886
01:47:52,342 --> 01:47:55,345
指挥中心 我们已全力启动停电系统 正在后退
Mission, we're in full OMS burn, trying to back out.

887
01:47:55,512 --> 01:47:57,097
好大的动静
There's a lot of vibration.

888
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,826
我们逃不过这一劫了
We're not getting away from this thing.

889
01:47:59,933 --> 01:48:02,519
奥德赛号 遥测数据显示结构受压过度

890
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:05,021
关掉系统 收到明白吗?

891
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:06,356
关掉系统
Cutting off burn.

892
01:48:08,859 --> 01:48:10,527
指挥中心
Mission.

893
01:48:11,194 --> 01:48:12,654
指挥中心? 指挥中心?
Mission? Mission?

894
01:48:12,821 --> 01:48:14,030
萨利?
Sally?

895
01:48:15,157 --> 01:48:17,033
朝向目标继续加速

896
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,286
预计两分钟内撞击

897
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,793
我要弹射睡眠舱

898
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:29,462
它们会按预定重新进入地球轨道

899
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:32,549
若我空出手来 就驾驶指挥舱
I'll fly the Command module out if I break free.

900
01:48:32,716 --> 01:48:34,509
- 我要你马上回睡眠舱去  - 不行
- I want you back there now.  - Absolutely not.

901
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:35,760
这是命令!
That's an order!

902
01:48:35,886 --> 01:48:37,053
杰克 不行 我们是一个团队
Jack, no, we're a team.

903
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:02,412
该走了 杰克! 还有30秒!
We've got to go, Jack! 30 seconds!

904
01:49:05,165 --> 01:49:07,709
记得梦到我们

905
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:49,376
杰克?
Jack?

906
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,895
49号技术员 以航行速度进入指挥中心

909
01:50:31,001 --> 01:50:33,336
别给我摇头了
Don't go all shaky on me.

910
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,122
杰克 我注意到
Jack, I can't help notice

911
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:13,001
你的呼吸和心跳速度都提高了
your respiration and heart rate have increased.

912
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:16,338
萨利 终于见到了你 我很兴奋

913
01:51:16,504 --> 01:51:21,509
最近反抗都模式化了
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

914

915
01:51:24,596 --> 01:51:26,514
我也挺担心的

916
01:51:27,724 --> 01:51:31,519
杰克 语音分析表明你在对我撒谎

918

给你5秒钟时间回答

919
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:44,574
我想让茱莉亚活下去

920
01:51:45,992 --> 01:51:48,661

杰克 你做得对
Jack, you're doing the right thing.

926
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,382
我不知道你是什么东西 来自何方
I don't know what you are, or where you're from,

927
01:53:26,259 --> 01:53:29,262
不过我告诉你些我读到的东西
but I'd like to tell you about something I read.

928
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:33,349
是个罗马故事
A story from Rome,

929
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:36,853
一个被你摧毁的城市
a city you destroyed.

930
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:39,355
很经典的故事
It's a classic.

931
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:43,359
有个叫贺拉斯的家伙
There was a guy, Horatius,

932
01:53:44,235 --> 01:53:47,363
面对整支军队 独自扛起一座桥
held the bridge alone against a whole army.

933
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:49,991
贺拉斯说道
And what Horatius said was,

934
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:52,202
"有什么比与厄运抗争而死..."
"How can a man die better..."

935
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:56,956
杰克 你不用死 她也不用死
You don't have to die, Jack. She doesn't have to die.

936
01:53:57,123 --> 01:53:59,501
萨利 人总有一死
Everybody dies, Sally.

937
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,377
关键是 要死得有尊严
The thing is, to die well.

938
01:54:10,386 --> 01:54:14,891
杰克 这不是你说的幸存者
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.

939
01:54:15,642 --> 01:54:17,644
没错 这不是
No, it's not.

940
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:43,878
贺拉斯说道
What Horatius said was,

941
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:47,048
"有什么比与厄运抗争而死"
"How can a man die better."

942
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,554
"更死得其所"
"Than facing fearful odds".

943
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:56,307
无人机! 快进去! 进去!
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!

944
01:54:56,474 --> 01:54:58,142
"为了寻找先祖的遗迹"
"For the ashes of his fathers."

945
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:03,773
"以及其信仰的殿堂"
"And the temples of his Gods".

946
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:07,443
杰克 我一手造就了你
I created you, Jack.

947
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,696
我就是你的神
I am your God.

948
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:23,751
去死吧 萨利
Fuck you, Sally.

949
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:20,141
这是战争后的地球
Earth, after the war.

950
01:56:20,808 --> 01:56:24,270
上次见到你 还是三年前的事了
Three years have passed since I saw your face.

951
01:56:25,897 --> 01:56:29,567
我疑惑 夜间梦境里是否追寻过你
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.

952
01:56:30,443 --> 01:56:33,946
而在白天 则从记忆中寻找你的身影
In the day, as memories.

953
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,951
你我的时间是否一致?
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?

954
01:56:41,496 --> 01:56:42,914
我疑惑 当你凝视她时
And I wonder if you see me

955
01:56:43,581 --> 01:56:45,249
是否看到我的影子
when you look at her.

956
01:56:57,387 --> 01:56:59,305
妈妈 快看
Mommy, look.

957
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,148
若我们有灵魂 也是由共同的爱铸就
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.

958
01:57:12,652 --> 01:57:14,987
经时间打磨
Undimmed by time.

959
01:57:16,072 --> 01:57:18,408
被死亡拆散
Unbound by death.

960
01:57:36,092 --> 01:57:39,637
三年来 我搜寻着他建的那所房子
For three years, I searched for the house he built.

961
01:57:41,514 --> 01:57:42,932
我知道 它一定就在那里
I knew it had to be out there.

962
01:57:46,769 --> 01:57:49,147
因为我了解他
Because I know him.

963
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,906
打过他
Lam him.

964
01:58:01,159 --> 01:58:02,326
那是谁?
Who's that?

965
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:13,087
我是杰克・哈珀
I am Jack Harper.

966
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:17,175
我回家了
And I am home.
