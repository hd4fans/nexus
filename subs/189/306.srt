1
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,590


2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,820


3
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,870


4
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,840


5
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,950
O'Donnell, save something for the game.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,420
l'm just warming up, coach.

7
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,450
Just talked to the scout again. He's coming tonight.

8
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,960
You play half the game l know you're capable of...

9
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,430
...he's prepared to offer you a full scholarship.

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,730
Free ride to college and the world's your oyster, kid.

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,770
Thanks, coach.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,630
All right, jockstraps, let's gather up. Picture time.

13
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,330
Try not to break the camera.

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,980
We gotta hang on. Ned's not here yet.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,600
Who cares? He's the water boy.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,410
That doesn't matter, because he's part of the team.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,520
Sorry l'm late! Sorry l'm late!

18
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,650
But what kind of Dungeon Master would l be...

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,990
...if l left my party in the middle of a battle with a hippogriff?.

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,750
Check it out, it's Merlin the Girlin.

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,100
Um, Ned, Ned, look, l'm your best friend, all right, and l'll always have your back.

22
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,760
But there's only so much l can do when you show up in a dress.

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,270
O'Donnell. How about you and Boy George join us for this picture?

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,230
Yep. Yep.

25
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,870
- Just one sec.

26
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,070
Give the little guy the sign, please. Here we are.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,010
Nice, guys. Scoot up in back.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,940
Come on, you gotta look pretty for the ladies, right? Come on.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,240
Yeah. Let's do it.

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,440
Three, two, one.

31
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,710
Nice

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,750
Hey, Vanilla lce.

33
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,860
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,120
Man, l had to.

35
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
l had to.

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,100
Oh, man, over there.

37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,300
Who is that stone- cold fox?.

38
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,160
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,580
O'Donnell!

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,980
Take no prisoners, bro.

41
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,480
Oh, hey, there's my girl. - Hey.

42
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,620
l'm glad you're here, Scar.

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,480
This whole scout thing has me wicked nervous.

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,380
l just feel like my whole future's riding on this game.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,490
Yeah.

46
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,220
 Yeah, l know how you feel.

47
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,090
Yeah? ls everything...? Everything's cool, right?

48
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,590
Oh, yeah. Everything's totally copacetic.

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,360
Totally?

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,900
- Totally.

51
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,160
O'Donnell.

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,030
l gotta go.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,460
See you.

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,810
You okay?

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,710
We can talk about it later.

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,750
- No. Just tell me.

57
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,450
lt's your big night. Go enjoy it.

58
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,150
l can't enjoy it unless you tell me what's going on.

59
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,020
Okay.

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,410
O'Donnell!

61
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,970
Wake up!

62
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,270
O'Donnell!

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,970
What are you doing?

64
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,740
Scar!

65
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,250
Scar, hey.

66
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,190
Hey, Scarlet.

67
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,710
Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing? - Mike, what are you doing?

68
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Look, you and me, we're in this together, okay?

69
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,030
But the game. That's your future.

70
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,660
- No, the baby's my future.

71
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,800
That's crazy.

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,550
- You're my future.

73
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,060
l can't let you throw this all away.

74
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,960
l won't let you.

75
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,360


76
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,520
Thank you for letting me stay here, Ned.

77
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Oh, yeah. No problem.

78
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,220
You good on the Cap'n?

79
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,380
- l'm good on the Captain.

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
Really

81
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,530
Hey, Mike?

82
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,260
Mike, l can tell you're down,

83
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,560
but trust me on this.

84
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,400
You're looking at Scarlet kicking you out of the house...

85
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,170
...and the kids wanting nothing to do with you as a negative,

86
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,470
 when in fact...

87
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,220
l guess it's mostly negative, isn't it? - Well, yeah.

88
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,850
l had no upside for that.

89
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,320
Hey! You're getting that big promotion today, right?

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,150
Yes. Yes, l am.

91
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,660
Today everything turns around for me.

92
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,950
Knock them dead.

93
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,120
l love you!

94
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,250
So anyway...

95
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,480
...the way corporate wants us to spin it...

96
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,780
...is that maybe, in certain situations...

97
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,120
...a four- hour erection isn't such a terrible thing.

98
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,220


99
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,520
Okay. Next up:

100
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,920
As most of you know, today l am proud

101
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,020
to be naming our new regional sales manager. Here we go. - You know...

102
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,600
...l've been in the pharmaceutical game for almost two years now...

103
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,400
...and people always ask me:

104
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,940
 ''What's it take to be an rSM?''

105
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,700
Leadership.

106
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
Courage.

107
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,770
lntegrity.

108
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,180
But most importantly,

109
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,950
dedication to this company.

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,490
So congratulations. Mike.

111
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,220
Mike, if you could slide to your left

112
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,090
 so l can congratulate our new rSM, Wendy!

113
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,460
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

114
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,360
Go out there and push some pills, my peeps.

115
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,130
Good job, baby!

116
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,700
Bye- bye, thanks.

117
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,740
See you at practice. Mmm.

118
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,000
Mike.

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,040
What's crack- a- lacking, coz?

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,910
Well, l'll tell you what's crack- a- lacking.

121
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,610
Are you kidding me?

122
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,950
Wendy's been here two months.

123
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,350
l've been here 16 years.

124
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,220
l got the best numbers on the team.

125
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,760
You should think of it as a compliment.

126
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,430
Think of it as us saying,

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,960
''You're just too valuable to promote.''

128
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,190
You little...

129
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,700
- Shh, shh, shh, hello?

130
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,930
Hey, buddy.

131
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,300
 No, no, no, l got time.

132
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,940
Ha. l know, right?

133
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,170
Look, listen, she was my doubles par...

134
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,930


135
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,580
So many girls and only one promotion,

136
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,840
but you guys are so supportive.

137
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,750
But, Wendy, you did it.

138
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,680
- Thank you.

139
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,250
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

140
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,690
You guys! OMG.

141
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,050
Oh, and it gets better, because we are going to T.G.l. Friday's!

142
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,360
Shut up! - Aah!

143
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,320


144
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,960
Mike O'Donnell.

145
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,370
Do l know you?

146
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,970
No. But l know you.

147
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,970
Oh, yeah?

148
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,600
High school star.

149
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,140
 Never quite lived up to your potential.

150
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,440
Sooner or later you all come back to the old school.

151
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,020
Stand there and look at the picture of the glory days...

152
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,090
...wondering what might have been.

153
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,590
Seems to me you guys are living in the past.

154
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,490
Well, of course l want to live in the past.

155
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,650
lt was better there.

156
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,360
l'll bet you wish you had it to do all over again.

157
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,130
Huh. You got that right.

158
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,700
You're sure about that?

159
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, yeah.

160
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,950
Dad.

161
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,950
- Hi, Mr. O'Donnell.

162
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,850
Ladies.

163
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,950
 What are you doing here?

164
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, l was just talking to...

165
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,420
...nobody.

166
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,060
Doesn't matter.

167
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,360
l got off work early, and l thought we could go for some ice cream.

168
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,620
Together?

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,860
Why?

170
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,500
- Just go get your brother, okay?

171
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,830
Do you need anything else?

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,670
No, we're fine.

173
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,210
What's the matter Maggie? This used to be your favorite place.

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,970
We used to come here for your birthday.

175
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,450
- When l was, like, 8.

176
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,020
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

177
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,130
You ready? - Yeah.

178
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,190
Been working on that outside shot? - Mm- hm.

179
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,350
Passing? - Good.

180
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,860
Dribbling? - really good.

181
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,900
Good's not going to get you a scholarship.

182
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,130
l meant, it's great.

183
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,290
 lt's great, Dad. lt's great.

184
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,500
That's my boy.

185
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,870
remember, it's not how big you are.

186
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,200
lt's how big you play.

187
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,930
right up here.

188
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,380
Uh, Maggie got into Georgetown.

189
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,710
Maggie, that's awesome.

190
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,280
Can you turn down the?

191
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,830
Okay, guys, see you soon.

192
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,670
Love you.

193
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,970
Nice chatting with you.

194
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,390
What the hell are you doing?

195
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,850
What the hell are you doing?

196
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,560
Hey, that's my stuff.

197
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,700
Why are you destroying our yard?

198
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,770
lt's not our yard. lt's my yard, remember?

199
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,240
You took the road not taken. And l get the yard.

200
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,840
l'm going to turn it into a showpiece for my clients.

201
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,010
Clients of what?

202
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,810
- Landscape design.

203
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,610
Landscape design?

204
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,150
l'm going to show people what l can do.

205
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,190
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final for another two weeks,

206
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,390
 so you have no right.

207
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,490
really?

208
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,790
So l've spent the last 18 years of my life listening to you whine...

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
...about the things you could've done without me,

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,970
and l have no right?

211
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,970
lt's just l put a lot of work into this yard.

212
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,440
- Did you?

213
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,630
really?

214
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,110
 Like the barbeque pit?

215
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah.

216
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,840
Yeah. The way l remember that is that you spent about an hour working on it...

217
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,640
...and then you spent the next two days complaining about...

218
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,790
...if you had gone to college, you could've hired someone to do it.

219
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,350
l don't think it was a whole two days.

220
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,680
- Or the hammock over here.

221
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,450
Yeah.

222
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,560
Yeah.

223
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,660
l think you quit that one

224
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,030
 because you just decided not to try anymore.

225
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,430
Look, try to see things from my point of view.

226
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,540
l am extremely disappointed with my life.

227
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,140
l never asked you to marry me.

228
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,270
Yeah, but l did.

229
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,470
Well...

230
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,270
...you don't have to do me any more favors, then.

231
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,080
We're not going to hold each other back anymore, okay?

232
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,620
Scar...

233
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,780
- l'll see you at court, okay? At the trial.

234
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,290
Scarlet.

235
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Naomi! You came. Of course l came.

236
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,020
What bridesmaid would l be if l didn't hold your hand during the divorce?

237
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,100
Now, just remember. The first one's always the hardest.

238
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,830
Mike.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,400
- Naomi.

240
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,260
Naomi.

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,100
- l don't care.

242
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,360
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.

243
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,270
 We gotta get you back on the market.

244
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,700
Yeah, l'm a real catch.

245
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,780
Single mom with two teenage kids

246
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,000
and manure caked under my fingernails.

247
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,980
You'll do great.

248
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,620
You got the butt of a 12- year- old boy.

249
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,120
That's terrific. l hope our daughter heard that.

250
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,590
Ugh. When was the last time you waxed?

251
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,930
Bye, Mike.

252
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,630
Bye.

253
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,460
You're sure about that?

254
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,170
Jesus.

255
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,690
Hey! Get off of there!

256
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,440
Oh, no.

257
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,010
 Hello?

258
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,670
Hello?!

259
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,310
Hello?!

260
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,210
What the?

261
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,080
Oh, no!

262
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,960


263
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,180
Ned?

264
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,150
Thief!

265
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,750
No, no, no, Ned!

266
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,580
 Ned, no, no, no! lt's me!

267
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,960
Stop!

268
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,860
Stop!

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Ned?

270
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, wow. l feel great.

271
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
What are you doing? No, Ned.

272
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,550
Aah! Aah! - No.

273
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,720
No, no, no, Ned!

274
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,300
Ned!

275
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,490
 Come on! lt's me, it's Mike!

276
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Ned, Ned, Ned, l'm telling you, l'm telling you, stop it!

277
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,340
Stop it! Now!

278
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,280
An elegant weapon...

279
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,250
...from a more civilized time.

280
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,150
Hey, it's me! lt's Mike O'Donnell,

281
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,660
your best friend!

282
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,030
You have an undescended testicle.

283
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,300
Googleable!

284
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,200
Ned!

285
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,830
You helped me cheat on my math test,

286
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,030
 but l got caught.

287
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,440
Public record!

288
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,420
You asked Princess Leia to junior prom.

289
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,090
Covered by the local news.

290
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,560
l can't breathe! l can't breathe!

291
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,570
Please. Oh! - Ha, ha!

292
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,840
Oh, my God.

293
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,940
No, no, no.

294
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,810
Ned, Ned.

295
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,070
Oh, my God.

296
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,320
Would you stop staring at me?

297
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,960
lt's freaking me out.

298
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,430
- lt's freaking me out!

299
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
l'm pubescent!

300
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,040
Okay. So, uh...

301
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,710
...it's a classic transformation story.

302
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
lt appears in the literature time and time again.

303
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,050
Were you at any point shot by a gamma ray?

304
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,840
No.

305
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,080
- Exposed to gamma radiation of any kind?

306
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,280
No, Ned.

307
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,250
- No?

308
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,480
You wouldn't see it. Okay.

309
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,820
That eliminates these and those and most of that side.

310
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,160
Are you now or have you ever been...

311
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,310
...a Norse god, vampire, or time- traveling cyborg?

312
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,770
l've known you since, what, first grade?

313
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,670
l would have told you.

314
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,810
Vampire wouldn't tell.

315
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,040
Cyborg wouldn't know.

316
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,180
Shut up.

317
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,650
Okay, if it's not any of those,

318
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,840
 l guess, um, we're looking at your basic...

319
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,050
...spirit guide transformation magic.

320
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,550
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

321
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,520
That is here.

322
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,390
When the hero...

323
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,050
l guess that's... l guess, you. - Hm.

324
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,960
Uh, is transformed by his spirit guide to...

325
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,060
...set him on a new path.

326
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,070
Which is what?

327
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,260
- Do l look like your spirit guide?

328
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,410
The janitor.

329
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,850
The janitor.

330
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,090
You guys see the janitor?

331
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,390
Have you seen the janitor?

332
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,230
Do you know where the janitor is?

333
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,890
No.

334
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,060
Hey, where's the janitor?

335
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,260
Where does the janitor work?

336
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,340
Excuse me!

337
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,230
- You all right, kid?

338
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,930
There's another janitor who works here.

339
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,700
- Just me.

340
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,810
No, no. There's an older guy with white hair who works here.

341
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,450
l was here yesterday talking to the janit...

342
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,670
l showed him this picture of me.

343
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,980
You? - Yeah.

344
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,610
That picture's from 1989.

345
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,720
right. Forget it.

346
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,990
Alex!

347
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,790
Alex!

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,700
Alex, buddy!

349
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,170
Alex!

350
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,360
Hello?

351
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,940
Hello?

352
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,040
Spirit guide?

353
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,640
What am l supposed to do?

354
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,940
Don't know what l'm supposed to do.

355
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,360
Ouch. Oh, ow.

356
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,660
l got shot. Did l get shot or did l get...? Someone got powned.

357
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,800


358
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,600
lt's a grenade. Ned.

359
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,070
Aah! Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

360
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,640
l figured it out. l figured out what l'm supposed to do. l figured out what my spirit guide wants me to do.

361
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,540
l'm going back.

362
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,420
l'm going back to high school, Ned!

363
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,050
No! No, no. No way.

364
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,050
Your spirit guide would not waste transformation magic...

365
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,420
...on you reliving your senior year and going to prom.

366
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,020
No.

367
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,180
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over,

368
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,830
 but to do it right.

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,120
Wouldn't you, if you had the chance?

370
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,200
- No. l would not.

371
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,330
l'm rich, and nobody stuck my head in a toilet today.

372
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,940
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

373
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,700
lt's about you.

374
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,330
- No, it's much bigger than me.

375
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,070
lt's about you. - Okay, maybe it's about me...

376
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,210
...but what's wrong with that?

377
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,740
l have not done anything

378
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,470
 for me since 1989.

379
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,180
You do what you have to do. But don't think about sucking me into this with you.

380
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,280
Hayden was the low point of my existence...

381
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,760
...and l vowed l would never go back to that godforsaken place!

382
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,450
Never, ever, ever!

383
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,290
Never!

384
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,400
Never, ever, ever!

385
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,700
l hate you.

386
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,500
Hello.

387
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,510
l'm here to enroll my son...

388
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,340
...in school.

389
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,040
Mark.

390
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,310
What's up?

391
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,580
So...

392
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,590
So we'll just have a seat till you're ready for us.

393
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,820
We'll be right, uh... Okay.

394
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,930


395
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,830


396
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,600
What's this you're wearing?

397
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,810
This is cool. This is hip.

398
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,340
l have a picture of Kevin Federline wearing exactly the same thing.

399
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,170
l don't know who that is.

400
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,680
- What are you wearing?

401
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,940
l told you, like a dad. - l am.

402
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,680
You look like Clay Aiken.

403
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,510
- Leave him out of this.

404
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,750
Are you sure these look legit? - Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

405
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:47,360
l'm the guy who invented the software that prevents people from stealing music.

406
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,130
l also invented the software that helps people steal music...

407
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,360
...but that's a happy coincidence.

408
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,870


409
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,730
What is that?

410
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,530
Oh, my G...

411
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,970
Wrong. These are for me.

412
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,670
- You kidding?

413
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,280
What's- her- name and Chewie's for me.

414
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,940
- Miss Masterson will see you now.

415
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,310
Let's go.

416
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,590
Just don't try to be funny, all right?

417
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,450
Say as little as possible.

418
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,350
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

419
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,320
So sorry, sir. Our fault.

420
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,220
- Stan.

421
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,020
Hello.

422
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
 l'm Jane Masterson, principal here at Hayden High.

423
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,000
Hi.

424
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,680
Hello.

425
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,550
Hello.

426
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,350
Hi. - Hi.

427
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,720
Uh, okay.

428
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,120
Yeah, l think we're good here.

429
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,990
Sorry.

430
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,960
l think our hands just made a baby.

431
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,260
Excuse my dad.

432
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,700
 He's not used to talking to attractive women.

433
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,030
Oh, thank you...

434
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:03,670
Mark. Mark...

435
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,340
...for that flattering yet totally inappropriate comment.

436
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,980
Please sit.

437
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,350
Before we get started, l think you should know that,

438
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,180
uh, Mark's a bastard.

439
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,450
Excuse me?

440
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,060
l had him out of wedlock, so...

441
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,090
...l'm single.

442
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,490
And l'm very rich.

443
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,090
Okay.

444
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,600
Did you bring your transcripts?

445
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,360
- Oh, yeah.

446
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,300
Transcripts.

447
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,000
Last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut.

448
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,040
Straight- A student. Very impressive.

449
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,040
Math club...

450
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,980
...National Merit finalist...

451
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,450
...Coney lsland Hot Dog Eating Champion.

452
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,590
Well, l think Hayden would be lucky to have you.

453
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,490
Welcome.

454
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,100
- Thank you.

455
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,770
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold. Do you have a question?

456
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,070
Your hair is pretty.

457
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,200
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

458
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,710
Would the lady mind if l smelled it?

459
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,710
Now is probably a good time to tell you

460
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,080
that l don't date students' parents.

461
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,920
Well, maybe l should tell you that

462
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,920
l never don't not date the principal of my child.

463
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,420
Okay, come on, Dad.

464
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,930
 Come on, Dad.

465
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,720
Let's go.

466
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,690
l was about to close!

467
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,630
You have to do it right now?

468
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,270
Just calm down. You're a dad.

469
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,370
Hi.

470
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,060
Oh, my gosh. We're in. - You see her undress me with her eyes?

471
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,180
l don't think that's what that was.

472
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,680
Hey. Wow. l don't know how we did it.

473
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,040
lt's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

474
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,440
Hey, girls,

475
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,950
how's it going? Do l know you?

476
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,080
What'd you do, mug K- Fed?

477
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,020
Welcome to the bottom of the food chain.

478
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,750
Hey, look, you always had my back in high school, okay?

479
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,630
So if your spirit guide wants you to be a fake teenager...

480
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,960
...and me to be your fake dad...

481
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,070
...the least l can do is make sure that my fake son doesn't look...

482
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,170
...like a total douche.

483
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,470
l don't look like a douche.

484
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,510
 What a douche.

485
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,340
We're going shopping.

486
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,070
really?

487
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,740
- Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

488
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,750
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

489
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,780
Ooh. Let's go to school.

490
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,040
Hey, yo, check it out.

491
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,750
 That's just rude.

492
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,950


493
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,650
What's up, dude?

494
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,690
What are you looking at, punk?

495
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,530
Watch it. Wake up, douche.

496
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,200
Sorry.

497
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,400
No phones, no texting.

498
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,140
Settle, people.

499
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,510
 Settle down.

500
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,980
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

501
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,380
Hello?

502
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,980
Hello?

503
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,960
 - Where the hell are you?

504
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,500
Oh, cr...

505
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,660
The thing. You mean our divorce?

506
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,500
Do you take any of this seriously?

507
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,600
No, no! Yes, l take this seriously.

508
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,830
Yes, l take this seriously.

509
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,530
l had to leave the country

510
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,970
very suddenly, uh...

511
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,480
...with the Mayan... lnca, l'm with the lncas in Peru.

512
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,840
We think we might have found the next...

513
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,640
...rogaine.

514
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,320
Are you with a girl?

515
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,350
No, no. lt's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

516
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,860
So would you consider maybe dating a 10th- grader?

517
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,000
l think we could go for full custody.

518
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,360
No, you can't take my kids away from me.

519
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,130
Since when do you care?

520
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,290
Look...

521
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,670
...l'm a lot closer to them than you think.

522
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,140
Let's reschedule, okay?

523
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,340
Hey, Maggie.

524
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,120
Um, why is the new kid waving at me?

525
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,950
l don't know.

526
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,090
But if that boy were an apple...

527
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,630
...he'd be a Delicious.

528
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,890
Oh, God.

529
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,240
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

530
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,340
Oh, jeez.

531
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,500
Man, you know, l will tell you something.

532
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,410
ln 10 years you're going to have this thing right here...

533
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,410
...that no amount of crunches will get rid of.

534
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,420
And spot reduction, total lie.

535
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,020
You know, l...

536
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,080
Never mind. Give me the ball.

537
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,980
Fakes right, goes left.

538
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,650
And signature move.

539
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,890
Kid.

540
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,460
l'm Coach Murphy. - Oh, wow.

541
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,770
You're still here? - What?

542
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:11,940
You're a legend.

543
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,410
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

544
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,100
lt's actually my last one.

545
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,410
Good hops, kid. Nice handle.

546
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,380
We're looking for a point guard.

547
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,150
Oh, yeah?

548
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,190
Why don't you come to tryouts?

549
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,950
 - Okay.

550
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,960
l'm done talking to you.

551
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,460
- Yeah, yeah.

552
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,590
Hey, how's it going?

553
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,860
Things are looking up.

554
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,730
Coach Murphy practically put me on the team.

555
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,470
That's not a coincidence. We're on the path.

556
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,200
That's great.

557
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,870
That's super you're finding your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

558
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,340
Here's something. l need you to do something for me.

559
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,340
l need you to get in trouble.

560
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,850
Not, like, big trouble.

561
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,980
Just enough trouble so that the principal needs to meet with your father.

562
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,590
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

563
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,490
Oh! Boom. Ned!

564
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,920
Boom. Checkmate, Samir!

565
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,320
Damn it! Checkmate.

566
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,190
Uh, can l get a little help in here?

567
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,060
Alex?.

568
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,440
How does it...?

569
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,610
Who did this to you?

570
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,370
- The basketball team.

571
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,850
But why? Why? You're one of them.

572
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,610
You're popular.

573
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,150
Uh, look, this is kind of personal,

574
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,450
and l don't know you.

575
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,090
- Yeah.

576
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,990
l'm taped to the toilet.

577
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,030
l'm sorry, l'm Mark Gold,

578
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,690
uh, your uncle Ned's kid.

579
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,160
 l just started here.

580
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,270
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

581
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,400
Well, l'd shake your hand...

582
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,590
...but it's taped to my ass.

583
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,830
- right. right.

584
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,370
Would you mind?

585
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,270
Yeah, yeah, sure. - Yeah, um.

586
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,470
Just rip. - l'm going to get it.

587
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,080
Band- Aid.

588
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,710
- Go for it.

589
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,190
So how come we never met?

590
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,690
My mom didn't want anyone to know

591
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,380
she had a kid with Ned.

592
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,150
That makes sense. - Yeah.

593
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,060
So since we're practically family and all...

594
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,830
...my dad says we should just keep an eye on each other, you know?

595
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
Uh, yeah. Why not?

596
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,330
Next time you could get there before they tape me to the toilet.

597
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,700
You got it.

598
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,270
This looks good.

599
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,780
Who's that? Oh, uh...

600
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,610
Nicole.

601
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,720
- Are you two going out?

602
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,720
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

603
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,380
She'd never go out with me.

604
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,260
You know, when l first met your mother, l was so nervous...

605
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,950
You met my mother?

606
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,660
What?

607
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,460
- My mother.

608
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,100


609
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,600
You said, ''The first time l met your mother, l was nervous.''

610
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,630
Oh, that's weird. ls your mom hot?

611
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,330
- Dude, what...?

612
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,000
What do l say to that?

613
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,470
- l was joking.

614
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,370
Joking, dude.

615
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,350
Stan.

616
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,180
l hate that guy.

617
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,990
Oh. - Thanks.

618
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,950
What? - Huh.

619
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,390
Freshman. Good sandwich.

620
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,050
ls that the guy who taped you to the toilet?

621
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,390
Yeah.

622
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,120
Yesterday he shoved me in a washing machine in my own house.

623
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,560
What was that jerk doing at your house?

624
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,600
- lt's Maggie's boyfriend.

625
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,240
Maggie has a boyfriend?

626
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,940
Well...

627
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,140
...l'm very disappointed in your sister.

628
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,010
He's looking.

629
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,310
 Don't make eye contact. He's kind of temperamental.

630
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,010
You're looking.

631
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,680
- l'll look at him.

632
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,550
Stop it, stop it.

633
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,160
Hey, twinkle douche.

634
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,550
lf l wanted you in the cafeteria,

635
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,660
 l would've taped you to a lunch lady.

636
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,330
You little punk.

637
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,590
You don't talk to him that way.

638
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,040
Yeah?

639
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,700
What are you gonna do?

640
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,770
What am l gonna do?

641
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,180
First...

642
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,110
...l'm going to call your father.

643
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,490
Heads up!

644
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,100
Give me my ball back, bitch.

645
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,000
You know, Stan, l feel sorry for you.

646
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,970
You don't know me.

647
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,940
 - Oh, but l do.

648
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,670
All too well.

649
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,740
You're the man.

650
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,950
Captain of the basketball team.

651
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,210
Dates the pretty girls.

652
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,050
High school is your kingdom.

653
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,520
But, people...

654
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,850
...Stan's a bully.

655
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,550
Why?

656
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,700
lt'd be way too easy to say

657
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,660
Stan preys on the weak simply because he's a dick.

658
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,600


659
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,300
No. No, no.

660
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,700
Stan here...

661
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,310
...is much more complex than that.

662
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,340
See, according to leading psychiatrists...

663
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,310
...Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

664
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,920
One:

665
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,950
Underneath all of that male bravado...

666
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,220
...there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out.

667
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,060
Two:

668
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,160
Like a caveman...

669
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,660
...Stan's brain is...

670
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,130
...underdeveloped.

671
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,170
Therefore, Stan is unable to use self- control.

672
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,710
And so he acts out aggressively.

673
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,780
And the third reason:

674
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,340
Stan has a small wiener.

675
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

676
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,720
Whoa, whoa, hey. Drinking age is still 21 , thank you very much.

677
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,110
Unless your spirit guide gave you a fake lD,

678
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,810
this is mine.

679
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,290
What are you eating?

680
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,430
l don't even know. l just know l'm hungry.

681
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,060
All the time.

682
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,860
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

683
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,560
That's your can now. We'll label it like that.

684
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
So, what did you learn at school today?

685
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,800
That l'm a bad dad.

686
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,270
 - l thought it was going great.

687
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,940
lt was going fantastic for me.

688
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,350
And then what?

689
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,110
And then l found out my son spent the last year being the school punching bag...

690
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,280
...and watched my daughter get a tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

691
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,050
High school's delightful, isn't it?

692
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,320
Yeah. But l think l was wrong about my spirit path.

693
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,400
And who was right?

694
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,830
See? l told you.

695
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,300
l told you high school was the wrong thing.

696
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,940
High school was right, but it's not about basketball.

697
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,480
lt's about helping Alex and Maggie.

698
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,210
All right. l'm getting out of here.

699
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,110
Disgusting.

700
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,080
- My kids need their father.

701
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,660
What's going on?

702
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,190
- Oh, hey, Mark.

703
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,700
What was that?

704
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,270
A three- pointer.

705
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,030
Can you do that twice in a row?

706
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,970
Okay.

707
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,140
Let's see you do it with a little pressure.

708
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,760
Wow, you're great. You should be on the team.

709
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,330
You should be on the team.

710
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,160
 l'm going to get you on the team.

711
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,960
That's it. That'll solve everything.

712
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,070
Dude, what are you talking about?

713
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,790
Nothing.

714
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,640
Well, that was fun.

715
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,800
 l haven't been to happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

716
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,250
Naomi, thank you so much. That is exactly what l needed.

717
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,780
Oh, great.

718
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,510
Mike who? - Mike who? l've never heard of the guy.

719
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,720
Ow.

720
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,120
Hey, Mom, this is Mark,

721
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,220
Uncle Ned's bastard.

722
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,660
l know. Someone had a kid with Uncle Ned. Ew.

723
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,140
You okay, Mrs. O'Donnell?

724
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,070
Yeah, l'm fine.

725
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,000
lt's ''Ms.,'' kid. lt's ''Ms.,'' Scarlet. Don't forget that.

726
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,640
Oh, right.

727
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,150
You look just like my husband.

728
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,220
 Doesn't he?

729
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,620
My ex- husband.

730
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,780
That is so weird. - Heh, heh.

731
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,650
lt is weird.

732
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,790
What is that?

733
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,430
Scarlet, l need you to come.

734
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,320
 l need you to come.

735
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,390
Weird.

736
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,220
Do you see that? -

737
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,300
 l did see it.

738
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,300
You see him? - She's nice.

739
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,490
But look at him.

740
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,860
You gotta let that guy go,

741
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
 just out of your brain and move on.

742
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,070
l know you need to grieve a relationship. lt's only natural.

743
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,640
Okay.

744
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,610
You wait here. l'm going to go smell him.

745
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,480
No, no, no. Sweetie. You're not allowed to smell teenagers.

746
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,280
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this. Here's the thing.

747
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,180
Here's the other thing, you need to acknowledge the fact...

748
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,590
...that he looks exactly like Mike used to look in high school.

749
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,230
We discussed that. l have looked at him.

750
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,290
But, honey, this is the thing:

751
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,930
You need to hook up with someone new.

752
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,230
Yeah, l deserve to have somebody smile at me

753
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,430
and tell me l'm pretty.

754
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,330
You do. - Even if it is...

755
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,000
...to just get me to go home with him.

756
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,200
Or lunch. But, yes,

757
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,740
 we're gonna find you a new playmate. Ow!

758
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,310
You little turd.

759
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,780
You little snot.

760
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,610
My bad. Gosh, l'm so sorry.

761
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,250
l guess l was, uh, kind of distracted,

762
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,650
as l imagine Alex was...

763
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,050
...at hearing about how his mother, who is still married, by the way...

764
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,420
...is planning to run around with every guy she can get.

765
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,860
ln Afghanistan, she'd be dragged through the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

766
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,660
l'm just saying. l'm just saying, Naomi.

767
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,320
Naomi.

768
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,330
- l don't care.

769
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,540


770
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,580
Hey, guys. Oh.

771
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,820
Okay, settle down. Take your seats.

772
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,320
Thank you, thank you.

773
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,920
 Thank you, Stan.

774
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:03,920
 Thank you.

775
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,820
Okay,

776
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,560
 today we will be continuing our discussion on human sexuality.

777
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:10,820
And as we discussed,

778
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,270
the official school policy is abstinence.

779
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,370
Now, that is very sensible.

780
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,440
l'm glad that someone here has their head screwed on straight.

781
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,270
l think all of us should make a pact to abstain from sex.

782
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,110
Now, who's with me, you guys?

783
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,010
 Come on.

784
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,780
Oh, my God.

785
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,950
Maggie? - Hm?

786
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,280
However, let's get real.

787
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,390
l know asking high school seniors to be abstinent...

788
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,960
...is like asking a porcupine to poop goat cheese.

789
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,960
Yuck.

790
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:47,400
So since the majority of you are or will become sexually active at some point...

791
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,670
But that point should be way, way in the future, right?

792
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,870
Well, the official school position...

793
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,280
...is that we prepare you for safe sex now.

794
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,710
So please take one and pass it down.

795
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,020
l have needs.

796
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,190
You don't need these.

797
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,730
 Stan, give one to Mark.

798
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,060
No.

799
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,260
No, you know what, he's right.

800
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,030
 He's right. l don't need one.

801
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,690
You know why l don't need one?

802
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,000
Because there's no one l'm in love with.

803
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,200
lt's called ''making love,'' isn't it?

804
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,340
Maybe l'm old- fashioned,

805
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,840
 but l think that means you do it with someone you love.

806
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,280
And preferably when you're married.

807
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,510
You know, when you're ready to take that love

808
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,210
 and turn it into a baby.

809
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,690
Because that's what love is.

810
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,660
lt's that first moment when you hold your baby girl...

811
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,730
...and you didn't know that anything could be so small or so delicate.

812
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,300
And you feel that tiny heart beat...

813
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,870
...and you know that you couldn't love anything more in the whole world.

814
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,910
And you hope that you can do right by that little girl...

815
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,040
...and always be there to catch her when she falls, and that nothing ever hurts her.

816
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,580
Not a broken arm...

817
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,750
...or a bad dream...

818
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,190
...or a broken heart.

819
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,300
l don't want these.

820
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,370
Just take them. Me either.

821
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,030
Are you serious?

822
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,700
Great, fine, wonderful.

823
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,100
More for me.

824
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,270
Now l got enough for the whole weekend.

825
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,740
Oh, my God!

826
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,340
Stan!

827
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,150
- Boys, stop it!

828
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,520
Break it up! Get off him, Stan!

829
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,180
Put those phones away!

830
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,150
 Stop it!

831
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,290
Stop hitting him!

832
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,290
No fighting!

833
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,390
You like that?

834
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,160
- You're gonna go to jail again.

835
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,540
Look at that. He slapped him like a mother.

836
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,440
That thing sucks.

837
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,670
Oh! - Oh, that's wrong.

838
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,600
Yo, check this out. My cousin in New York sent it to me.

839
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,520
l hope l'm not late for our meeting.

840
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,290
Busted for fighting, nice.

841
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,760
 Who won?

842
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,200
You know, it was actually pretty even.

843
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,600
really?

844
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,170
On YouTube it looked like you got your ass kicked.

845
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,000
l saw it a couple times.

846
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,300
What are you wearing? - Hm?

847
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,210
Beckham.

848
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,470
- No, what?

849
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,200
Oh, the clothes. Oh, right.

850
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,650
To the untrained eye, l look like a total idiot.

851
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,290
You do, in fact.

852
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,750
Ah. But it's actually a seduction technique known as ''peacocking.''

853
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,820
My outfit serves the dual function of icebreaker

854
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,960
and attention- getter.

855
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,630
You can go in now.

856
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,160
Watch.

857
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,160
Are you peacocking?

858
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,370
really? You think that's gonna work?

859
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,480
l think it just might.

860
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,910
ls that?

861
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,680
 Mrs. O'Donnell! How you doing?

862
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,120
Hello, how are you?

863
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,520
l'm good. How are you?

864
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,930
Good.

865
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,800
Wow. This is gonna take some getting used to.

866
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,940
You're Ned's son?

867
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,470
Yeah. Yeah. Ned gave birth to me.

868
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,070
Well,

869
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,800
 he didn't give birth... You know what l meant.

870
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,270
You're doing some gardening.

871
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,140
l'm redoing the backyard. - Oh.

872
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,340
You want to see?

873
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,540
Yeah, sure. l got some time.

874
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,480
Oh, wow.

875
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,620
Yeah. Obviously, l still have a lot to do.

876
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,920
You can put that... -

877
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,650
 right here?

878
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,460
All right.

879
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,730
Thank you.

880
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,390
So this is it.

881
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,060
- This is it.

882
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,440
lt used to look a lot worse. Mm- mm.

883
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,230
Basically, uh, what l planned to

884
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,210
do was to put a pond in over here...

885
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,870
Okay. ...and have water...

886
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:29,040
...streaming in from both sides.

887
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,160
And then put a big deck right here...

888
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,120
...and then a flagstone patio there with sod in between.

889
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,560
That would be pretty.

890
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,290
And then to have twinkling lights above the whole thing...

891
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,040
...so that every night is a starry one. Heh.

892
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,670
lt's gonna be amazing, Scar.

893
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,970
What did you just call me? Uh...

894
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,680
l just said, ''lt'll be amazing.''

895
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,470
- You called me ''Scar.''

896
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,670
My husband's the only one who calls me that.

897
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,250
Could you use some help?

898
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,080
Volunteer. l'm young, l'm strong.

899
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,050
Oh. Oh.

900
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,950
right, got it.

901
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,430
Okay.

902
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,730
l realize that whole lady cougar hunting...

903
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,130
...the ''mothers l'd like to,''

904
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,960
 you know, whatever, thing...

905
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,510
...is big with you guys, right? With you high school boys?

906
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,300
But that's not gonna happen between me and you.

907
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,780
l didn't even mean it that way.

908
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,640
l was thinking more along the lines of business experience,

909
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,080
 college application.

910
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,620
But if you want to go there, that's...

911
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,620
So l'll just get you a shovel, then? - Yeah.

912
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,650
Okay.

913
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,130


914
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,970
What?

915
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,020


916
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,240
l said we could do it!

917
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,140
- Called it.

918
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,310
Did you see the look on Stan's face?

919
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,350
Alex?.

920
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,680
 What happened at the tryouts?

921
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,410
How'd it go?

922
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,490
lt was good. Mark had a great tryout.

923
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,250
He played great.

924
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,790
Yeah.

925
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,960
 - And so did l. l made the team.

926
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,460
really? Oh, great!

927
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,290
That's so good. l'm so proud of you.

928
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,560
Me too.

929
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,200
He did great out there.

930
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,630
Oh, Mark. That's super inappropriate.

931
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,400
Good job today.

932
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:39,370
Good job!

933
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,010
- Thanks.

934
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,370
l want to show you something. Come here.

935
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,840
 l wanna show you guys.

936
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,980
Ta- da.

937
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,710
You hung the lights. Yes.

938
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,590
Wow. - Wow.

939
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,990
l wanted you guys to be the first to see.

940
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,390
Mom, it's sick.

941
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,080
really?

942
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,230
lt's so good.

943
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,920
Oh, my gosh.

944
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,630
Mark.

945
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,290
Mark, we should go practice, dude.

946
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:07,940


947
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,930
The game's on Friday.

948
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,770
 Mom, such a good job.

949
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,040
What do you think?

950
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,370
lt's amazing.

951
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,110
When people see how talented you are,

952
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,550
 you'll be designing gardens all over the city.

953
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,780
really?

954
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:28,750
Well, thank you, Mark. That's nice.

955
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,390
Oh. l have to go. l have a date tonight.

956
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,090
- You have a...?

957
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,320
You have a date?

958
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,140
l'm going dancing, which is ridiculous because l'm a terrible dancer.

959
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,130
You're an amazing dancer. - What?

960
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,200
Hm? Ahem. - Wh...?

961
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,310
You just look like you can move.

962
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,130
Um, okay.

963
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:54,770
l'm going to go, so have fun, Mark.

964
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,610
Night.

965
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,090


966
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,240
What are you looking at?

967
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,430
 - That was great.

968
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,130
That is The Snake.

969
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,400
That was a very hot dance when you were 1 .

970
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,810
Teach it to me.

971
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,710
 - l can't.

972
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,150
lt's a very advanced step...

973
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,650
...which l know is hard to believe because l make it look effortless.

974
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,480
That's the secret to all great dancers.

975
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,650
Try me.

976
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,460
Why did you pick that song?

977
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,720
Oh, l don't know. lt just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

978
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,960
Hm. That's funny.

979
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,170
That's the song that my husband and l danced to at our wedding.

980
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,260
Hm. A man of good taste.

981
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,700
Want me to show you some dance moves?

982
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,570
- l'd love to.

983
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,040
That l learned at my wedding.

984
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:56,970
Great.

985
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,270
 - Yeah. Okay, you stand here, like that.

986
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:01,280
Okay, like that,

987
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:01,850


988
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,920
and l'll stand here.

989
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,650
No, you stand right there.

990
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,250
- right there.

991
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,350
Okay, ready?

992
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,150
 So you go right foot back and then left foot back.

993
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,920
And then quick right, left, right, left, right.

994
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,260
And then right... Oh.

995
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,100
That was good. And left, right, left, right.

996
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,070
That's good.

997
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,100
That was really good.

998
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,430
 You're picking that up pretty quickly.

999
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,300
So you mentioned your husband. - Mm- hm.

1000
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,710
Do you think you guys are ever going to get back together?

1001
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,670
Um, no.

1002
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,480
Why are you so sure?

1003
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,950
Maybe there's something he could do to fix things.

1004
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,180
l love my husband and care about him...

1005
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:48,190
...but sometimes that just is not enough.

1006
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,660
Well, he blew it.

1007
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:51,990
Jump.

1008
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,040
Mom? - Yeah.

1009
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,780
Hey, Alex.

1010
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,320
Mom?

1011
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,520
l'm your mom.

1012
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,420
l am Alex's mom, Mark.

1013
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,080
Yeah.

1014
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,420
Your date is here. - Huh?

1015
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:27,160
The front door. Your date. - Okay.

1016
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,930
She was nervous.

1017
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,930
 lt's creepy, right?

1018
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,500
Little bit.

1019
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,940
She's so old, it's like...

1020
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,740
You dance with all your friend's moms?

1021
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,950
Pretty much.

1022
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:39,810
Oh, hi, Scarlet. - Hello.

1023
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,210
Wow, you look amazing. Here. Pour vous. Oh, thank you.

1024
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,220
Carnations. What a douche bag.

1025
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,410
Mark.

1026
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,420
No, that's okay.

1027
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,420
- l'm sorry.

1028
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,650
l'm a single dad.

1029
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,560
lt's totally normal

1030
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,490
for sons to feel weird when their moms date.

1031
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,830
l mean, he's stepping into Dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

1032
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,560
He's not my son, but... - Oh.

1033
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,070
Then that's weird.

1034
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,690
lt is. Yeah.

1035
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,600
Uh, do you want to go?

1036
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,100
- Yeah.

1037
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,430
Let me get my coat.

1038
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:08,200
Oh, come on.

1039
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:08,900
- Hold these, please.

1040
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,070
This guy?

1041
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:10,680
- You're being rude.

1042
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,940
You're going from Uncle Mike to this guy? - Shh.

1043
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:13,910
Be quiet.

1044
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,450
- Okay.

1045
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,310
Do me a favor. Shh.

1046
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,390
- He's a tool.

1047
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,820
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.

1048
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,180
 lt's our divorce papers.

1049
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,790
And remind him that he needs to be there on the 27th.

1050
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,120
Okay? Thank you.

1051
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,510
Where are you going?

1052
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,680
Jamie's party.

1053
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,230
Alex!

1054
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,890


1055
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,060
Yeah, uh, seriously, l can't be here. l really can't be here.

1056
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,700
Do you know how many dangerous and hurtful things

1057
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,060
 Stan could do to me here?

1058
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,300
Have you had your head shoved in a ball return?

1059
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,770
lt's not a scalp massage.

1060
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,070
You're on the basketball team now. Okay? This is your party.

1061
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,300


1062
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,950
Okay, okay, there she is.

1063
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,450
There's Nicole. Oh, God.

1064
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,050
Which one?

1065
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:21,680
 She's right there.

1066
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,190
You're looking at... She's my 3, your 2.

1067
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,780
Stop it. You're looking right at her.

1068
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:26,650
- Calm down.

1069
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,980
Sorry.

1070
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,150
- What was that?

1071
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,380
Nothing, it was a burp.

1072
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,420
- Why are you burping?

1073
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:33,560
l have tummy issues. What? Get over it.

1074
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,920
- Tummy issues?

1075
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,050
She's not going to like me. l'm a loser.

1076
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:37,820
Why are you a loser?

1077
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,060
Because Stan says you're a loser?

1078
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,300
Do you think Stan's a winner? Stan's going nowhere.

1079
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,740
Any girl in here would be lucky to have your attention.

1080
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,370
What do you know about girls?

1081
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,940
- What do l know about girls?

1082
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,410
l used to date the most beautiful girl in school...

1083
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,950
...and l let her slip through my fingers.

1084
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,020
But l'm not gonna let that happen to you.

1085
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,740
You're absolutely right.

1086
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,610
l'm just going to walk up to her

1087
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,690
and introduce myself.

1088
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,120
Tomorrow at school.

1089
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:04,950
 Maybe.

1090
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,650
Probably not.

1091
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,060
Just go.

1092
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,420


1093
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,030
Hey, girls.

1094
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:13,630
- Hey, you came.

1095
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,360
How are you?

1096
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,090
 - Good.

1097
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,500
Thank you, um.

1098
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,110
 Have you seen Maggie? l've been looking everywhere.

1099
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,640
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

1100
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,570
But, um, l am.

1101
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,540
And l'm really, really glad you came.

1102
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,770
lt's her birthday.

1103
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,510
- l didn't get you a present, l'm sorry.

1104
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,180
l'll just have to unwrap you.

1105
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:33,840
 - Heh, heh. Okay.

1106
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,650
l was kicked off the cheerleading squad

1107
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,890
 for being too flexible.

1108
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,150
Okay, okay.

1109
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,730
 Sit down.

1110
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,590
Just sit down.

1111
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,340
lf you girls don't respect yourselves...

1112
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,440
...then how do you expect anyone else to respect you?

1113
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,770
right?

1114
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:57,740
Don't respect me.

1115
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,350
No, don't respect me.

1116
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,780
You don't even have to remember my name.

1117
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,380
Wow, that's slutty.

1118
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,070
- First of all, you slut.

1119
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,850
This is some other dad's problem.

1120
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,650
And, um, l just want to tell you that you look like my dog.

1121
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,380
Excuse me? - Your hair looks like my dog's hair.

1122
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,220
Oh, um... - No, it's shiny and soft.

1123
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,600
We give my dog special food. lt's got flax in it.

1124
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:21,460
Oh,

1125
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,130
 flax.

1126
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:22,770


1127
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,970
She's a sweetheart.

1128
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:24,540
- That's sweet.

1129
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,570
Well, she died.

1130
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,210
So l look like your dead dog?

1131
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:29,970


1132
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,210
l'm just really nervous, and l've wanted to talk to you for so long.

1133
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:32,970
What am l thinking?

1134
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,980
- Don't worry about it. really.

1135
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,010
Alex?.

1136
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,450
- Oh, my God, you know my name.

1137
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,020
You're on fire.

1138
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,780
really?

1139
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,050
 - Literally, you're on fire.

1140
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,380
What?

1141
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,130
Literally on fire.

1142
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,660
Whoa. Okay. Yeah, l'm gonna get out of here. Later.

1143
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,370


1144
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,160
Just hand me those keys right there.

1145
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,740
They're in for the night.

1146
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,670
lf the keys are locked in there,

1147
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,610
 l don't know how l'm going to get you guys out.

1148
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,980
Conserve some oxygen in there.

1149
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,240
Don't scream, you have a limited amount of oxygen.

1150
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,550
They're pretty, huh?

1151
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,780
We got some pretty ladies in here.

1152
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,590
Oh, there you are.

1153
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,510
What do you want?

1154
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,200
- l just want to talk about Stan.

1155
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,670
Yeah?

1156
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,210
Why are you dating him?

1157
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,180
l mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

1158
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,220
He's crazy.

1159
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,090
Hey, don't say that about Stan. You don't even know him.

1160
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,720
Oh, but l do. l really do. l know him better than you.

1161
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,450
Look, we're moving in together after graduation.

1162
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,820
Stan got into Georgetown?

1163
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,590
What?

1164
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,730
- What?

1165
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,990
No. No.

1166
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,100
Stan got on the management track at Home Depot.

1167
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,930
Oh, great.

1168
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,830
And l'm going to Westwood Community College

1169
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,440
to be closer to him.

1170
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,940
He's my forever.

1171
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,980
There's no way in hell that's happening.

1172
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,950
- Excuse me?

1173
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,020
l said, ''There's no way in hell that that is happening.''

1174
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,820
You think l'm gonna let you mortgage your future?

1175
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,390
You think l'll let you throw away all your hard work...

1176
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,530
everything that you've accomplished... for some guy

1177
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,460
some psychopathic guy who doesn't care about you?

1178
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,960
l forbid you.

1179
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,530
l forbid you to see him anymore.

1180
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,600
Oh, okay! Who the hell do you think you are, my father?! Dude!

1181
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,400


1182
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,060
Don't walk away from me.

1183
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,970
 - You're a freak.

1184
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:40,970
Don't walk away from me.

1185
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,270
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

1186
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,980
Hey. How'd it go?

1187
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,770
- Fantastic.

1188
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,640
What's on your leg?

1189
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,550
We're the Warriors! Yeah, yeah!

1190
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,620
remember: Defense wins the game.

1191
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,620
What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.

1192
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,230
Oh. No.

1193
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,520
l was just thinking that the last time l was here...

1194
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:10,260
...my husband asked me to marry him. Wow.

1195
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,100
Tough to compete with that.

1196
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,740


1197
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,000
Down by 6, get the ball to Gold.

1198
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,740
Warriors on three. One, two, three.

1199
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,450
Warriors!

1200
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,580
Stan, what are you doing? Let's go.

1201
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,620
Go, Alex! Whoo!

1202
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,700
Left side.

1203
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,850
Pick off! right there!

1204
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,250
He's got too much time. Come on!

1205
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,000
Get it to McKinley! Get it in!

1206
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:15,690
 Get it!

1207
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,130
Get him!

1208
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,470
Ball!

1209
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,310
Ball!

1210
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,950
Come on, outside!

1211
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,540
O'Donnell! Give the ball to Gold!

1212
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,010
 Give the ball to Gold!

1213
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,350
No, no, no!

1214
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,460
We did it! You were great. Oh. Ooh. l, um...

1215
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,460
l'm sweaty. Um... -

1216
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,700
 Sorry about that.

1217
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,640
Congratula... That was awesome.

1218
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,110
You did a great... l saw the... l liked the dance.

1219
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,980
Yeah, so l think August... August will be good.

1220
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,740
All right, uh, have a good night.

1221
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,440
See you tomorrow.

1222
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:17,920
Oh. Hi. Wow, what are the odds?

1223
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,570
What's it going to be now, Ned?

1224
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,760
Did you buy me the Statue of Liberty?

1225
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,560
l'm just going to ask you out, okay?

1226
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:24,730
Like a grownup.

1227
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,540
Just two friends having dinner.

1228
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:32,540
Then if it turns into anything else, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

1229
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,940
No. Good night.

1230
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,650
l'll buy every student a laptop.

1231
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,850
You would deny the children of laptops?

1232
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,790
Miss Masterson, the children.

1233
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,460
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

1234
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,690
Fine.

1235
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,230
 But this is not a date.

1236
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,690
No, in no way a date.

1237
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,430
And if l do this, you will stop the inappropriate behavior and gifts.

1238
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,430
Yes.

1239
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,400
- And we'll just drive to this restaurant.

1240
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:00,130
We're not gonna fly there in the space shuttle...

1241
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,800
...or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

1242
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,180
No, let's take your car. How about?

1243
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,810
This way.

1244
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,350
Ned to driver, abort. Abort,

1245
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,920
abort. Move it out right now.

1246
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,620
l totally missed it. She came right up to me,

1247
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,320
l should've kissed her. And l froze.

1248
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,090
Hey, don't worry. l'll get you another chance.

1249
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,730
How? How are you going to do that?

1250
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,070
Victory party at my house!

1251
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,820
Maggie.

1252
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,600
Maggie?

1253
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,830
Hey, Maggie.

1254
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,670
Go away.

1255
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,900
Hey, what happened?

1256
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:08,910
What do you want?

1257
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:09,410


1258
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,100
rub it in my face? Say, ''l told you so''?

1259
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,540
No. No, l really don't.

1260
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,580
Just tell me what happened.

1261
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,220
Stan dumped me.

1262
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,990
Stan dumped you?

1263
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,160
Stan dumped you? What?

1264
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,630
What happened? How did this...?

1265
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,930
What did he do?

1266
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,160
What did he do?

1267
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,330
After the game...

1268
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:45,340
We... He took me behind the quad, and we...

1269
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,670
l can't hear this.

1270
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,710
You didn't.

1271
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,210
No, Mags.

1272
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,510
 - No.

1273
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,620
No.

1274
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,820
That's why he dumped me.

1275
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,300
Mags, hey.

1276
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,260
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1277
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,910
You know...

1278
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:16,810
...when you're young, everything feels like the end of the world.

1279
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,240
lt's not.

1280
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,250
right.

1281
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,820
lt's just the beginning.

1282
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:28,420
You might have to meet a few more jerks...

1283
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:30,680
...but one day you're going to meet a boy...

1284
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:34,190
...who treats you the way that you deserve to be treated.

1285
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,800
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

1286
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,940
You really think so?

1287
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,340
l know so.

1288
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,550
That's so sweet.

1289
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,950
You're the sweetest.

1290
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,380
Thank you.

1291
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:00,380
- lt's okay.

1292
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,750
Ow. Oh. - Thank you.

1293
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,220


1294
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:07,730
Anyways, l, uh, came over here... l was looking for you.

1295
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,460
l wanted to invite you to my party.

1296
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,260
 l don't know if you want to come.

1297
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,490
Yes. l would love to.

1298
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,360
- Yeah.

1299
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,090
Great. That's exciting. - Thank you!

1300
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,500
Aah! Yay! - Yes. Yay.

1301
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,070
Thank you.

1302
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,470
- That's very exciting.

1303
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,230
l know, it's great. Ha, ha.

1304
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:23,970
See you tonight.

1305
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,210


1306
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,880
At Mark's house.

1307
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,570
Hey, that's cool. Let me see that.

1308
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,070
That is nice, man.

1309
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,180
Don't touch the toys, okay?

1310
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:03,020
Yeah, l'll, uh, try not to light myself on fire tonight.

1311
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,480
l'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.

1312
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,240
 Oh, good.

1313
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,650
Do you want to sit outside?

1314
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,260
 - Sure.

1315
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,290
That's delightful.

1316
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,790
What?

1317
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:55,130
What?

1318
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay, l don't know how to act normal.

1319
01:11:59,170 --> 01:11:59,760
- Clearly.

1320
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,140
lt's the story of my life. l'm not smooth.

1321
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,680
l'm just trying to impress you, okay?

1322
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:08,180
l'm not the kind of guy who comes to places like this. l'm a dork.

1323
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,210
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand...

1324
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,850
...on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff from The Two Towers.

1325
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,390
Yes, that does make you a dork.

1326
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:24,190
Especially since Gandalf the Grey was only in Fellowship.

1327
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:28,320
He returns in Two Towers as Gandalf the White.

1328
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:41,540
(ln Elvish)

1329
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:54,360
l was upset. l'm sorry, okay?

1330
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,990
l need you to show me that you love me.

1331
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,070
And that way we can get a place together.

1332
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:04,100
Stop it. Look, whatever. l'm with somebody else now.

1333
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:05,300
What?

1334
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:07,670
- Party's over, Stan.

1335
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,670
Just get out of here.

1336
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,970
Oh, yeah?

1337
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:18,850
Who's gonna make me leave?

1338
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:19,750
You?

1339
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:21,050
You know l would,

1340
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,450
 but it smells like you've been drinking...

1341
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:27,320
...so l'm just gonna let the cops do it.

1342
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,330
You can have the nun.

1343
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,300
She doesn't put out, anyway.

1344
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,660
On second thought...

1345
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,110
Oh, l just had the craziest dream.

1346
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,620
l was 1 7.

1347
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,690
l was back in high school, and it was terrible.

1348
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,780
Scar.

1349
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,890
Scar?

1350
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,330
 l don't see a scar.

1351
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,330
Look, l know why you didn't want me to be with Stan.

1352
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,470
lt's because you wanted me.

1353
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,530
You want to play games?

1354
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,510
 l can play games.

1355
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,270
No, no, no. - l'm a hungry lioness...

1356
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:22,110
...and you're a baby gazelle.

1357
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,940
Maggie! No, no, no, Maggie, stop this now.

1358
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:25,420


1359
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,320
lf you only knew how highly inappropriate

1360
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,120
and dysfunctional this is.

1361
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,520
Stop it. Please stop.

1362
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:33,560
Maggie, l'm not the person that you think l am.

1363
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,520
Yes, you are.

1364
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,130
 - No, l'm not.

1365
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,160
You're right, you're good.

1366
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:38,030
You're not like the others.

1367
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,760
l'm not like others. l'm very different than the others.

1368
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,530
So different, in fact, that you and l can never,

1369
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,830
ever, ever, ever be together.

1370
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,970
Stop biting. - Why?

1371
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,480
Oh, my God.

1372
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,770
What are you saying?

1373
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,880
Are you confused?

1374
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,080
l'm very confused, yes.

1375
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,520
 Extremely confused.

1376
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:05,060
Oh, my God. l... l... l get it now.

1377
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:09,130
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed,

1378
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,160
and you have highlights.

1379
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:12,800
What are you talking about?

1380
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,830
 - l mean...

1381
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,770
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

1382
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:22,270
l'm not gay.

1383
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,930
l'm in love, Maggie. l'm in love.

1384
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,600
l've been in love.

1385
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,380
l've been in love with the same girl since l was 1 7, Maggie.

1386
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,810
Does she go to our school?

1387
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:35,650
Do l know her? Tell me her name. l want to know her name.

1388
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,650


1389
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,650


1390
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,120
No, Maggie. No. -

1391
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,660
 Okay.

1392
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:46,390
You tell your girlfriend she'd better keep a close eye on you.

1393
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,240
Sweet baby Jesus.

1394
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,770
Thanks.

1395
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,570


1396
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,080


1397
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,310


1398
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,610


1399
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,380


1400
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,680


1401
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,120
We'll take the check.

1402
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,200


1403
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,670
l'm so dead.

1404
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,110
Excuse me.

1405
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,720
Scarlet?

1406
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,280
Scarlet? Scarlet. - Hi.

1407
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:40,040
What are you doing here?

1408
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,190
- Have you seen Alex?.

1409
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,410
He's not picking up his phone. and it's past his curfew.

1410
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,250
Alex is fine. Alex is fine, believe me.

1411
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:47,650
ln fact, with the way things are going...

1412
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:51,130
...by the end of the night Alex could have a girlfriend.

1413
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,090
Alex has a girlfriend?

1414
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,760
- Yeah, and she's great. She's cute.

1415
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,990
Come on, l'll show you.

1416
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,530
 - Where?

1417
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,190
Walk up the stairs.

1418
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,000
 Walk with me for one sec, l'll show you.

1419
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,040
So how ever did you get the newest version of Halo?

1420
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,640
lt's not due out for another six months.

1421
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:10,050
Well, let's just say l said some things to the Make- A- Wish people...

1422
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,410
...that l'm not totally proud of.

1423
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,790
l'm going to kill him.

1424
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,380
Everybody, out!

1425
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:51,750
Oh, no, no. No! No! No! Not Dr. Philsopholis.

1426
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,860
This party is over!

1427
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:58,290
Unless you want to spend the next three months in detention,

1428
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,700
leave! Now!

1429
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:06,200
Okay. We better go warn Mark.

1430
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,310
You really care about him, don't you?

1431
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,810
Yeah.

1432
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,110
- That's nice. That's really nice.

1433
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,910
He really needs a male role model.

1434
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,920
He's a great kid. - Mm- hm.

1435
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,790
You know, they both are.

1436
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,630
l think you're a great mother.

1437
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,590
Thank you.

1438
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:33,630
He's on the balcony. He's right there.

1439
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,570
Mom?

1440
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,260
- This has been a really tough time...

1441
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,040
...and you really feel like part of the family.

1442
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:47,940
You have no idea how amazing it is to hear you say that.

1443
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,650
Scarlet.

1444
01:18:58,830 --> 01:18:59,450
Scarlet!

1445
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,030
Scarlet, l'm not Mark, okay?

1446
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,220
l'm him, l'm me.

1447
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,760
Scarlet, l'm your husband.

1448
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:05,900
- Will you stop it already?

1449
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,330
lf you'd listen to me, l am the father of your children!

1450
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,370
 Scar, let me...

1451
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,000
Don't call me that.

1452
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,500
 Don't call me that!

1453
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:15,540
You are a weirdo little man- child!

1454
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,610
Give me two seconds, and l can explain this!

1455
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,470
You are a pervert!

1456
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,780


1457
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,660
Get out, and get out,

1458
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:33,590
and get out.

1459
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,520
You can leave.

1460
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:43,800
Well, this isn't exactly the inconspicuous relationship l wanted.

1461
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,130
l'm sure now you can see why

1462
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:47,640
l don't date my students' parents.

1463
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,130
l'm sorry.

1464
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,170
l'm sorry.

1465
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,620
 l had no idea that it was going to get so out of control.

1466
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:04,220
Hm. really?

1467
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,520
Now l'm sorry.

1468
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,250
- l guess l deserved that.

1469
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,090
The second one was out of line.

1470
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,930
 lt was uncalled for. Sorry.

1471
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,190
Are you okay?

1472
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:17,930
 l'm really sorry.

1473
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,100
Three makes it even.

1474
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:22,370
Now we're even.

1475
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,640
How are you? You okay?

1476
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:27,250
Yeah.

1477
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,760
And finished.

1478
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,360
With the rug area.

1479
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,500
But we've made very good progress.

1480
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,570
We deserve a break.

1481
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,900
l lost my family.

1482
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:53,000
Hey, Mike?

1483
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:54,800
lf it's any consolation,

1484
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,940
 l think you really did help your kids.

1485
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:00,710
You did your job, and now the hero can move on.

1486
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,370
l don't want to.

1487
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,950
Maybe they don't need me anymore,

1488
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:07,350
 but l need them.

1489
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,750
Hey, not to be a buzzkill...

1490
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,220
...but you're due in court...

1491
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:15,020
...in 22 minutes.

1492
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,760
Ned, l need more time.

1493
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,160
l have to stop this.

1494
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:20,360
- To the Nedmobile.

1495
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,470
Wait, Ned, Ned, Ned.

1496
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,260
 - Yes.

1497
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,800
Pants.

1498
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,970
- l should have pants on. Yes.

1499
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,730


1500
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,780
Come on, Glenn!

1501
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,420
He's nothing but a glorified midget wrangler.

1502
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:43,890
You wouldn't be so big without that vest!

1503
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,620
Grab that thing that's down there.

1504
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,380
 Grab it. Just hold that up.

1505
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,320
Where you get this?

1506
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,330
- Best 20 ever spent.

1507
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,360
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

1508
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:53,590
Dude, just hold it. Hold it way up.

1509
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,780
The whole truth, nothing but the truth,

1510
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,820
so help you God?

1511
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:16,320
l do.

1512
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,720
You request a divorce by the state of California...

1513
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:21,330
...citing irreconcilable differences. This correct?

1514
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,860
Yes, Your Honor.

1515
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:25,520
- ls Michael O'Donnell present?

1516
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,670
No, Your Honor.

1517
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,170
l take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce.

1518
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,270
Let's proceed.

1519
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,230
You are not requesting sole custody?

1520
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,070
- No, Your Honor.

1521
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:41,440
You can't handle the truth!

1522
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,640
What?

1523
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,510
l'm sorry, l panicked.

1524
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,980
lt was the first thing that came into my mind.

1525
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,990
Your Majesty.

1526
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:49,780
Who are you?

1527
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,510
 - That's my husband's best friend.

1528
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,820
You a lawyer, best friend?

1529
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,520
Yes.

1530
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,530
- No.

1531
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,000
l believe the law degree in my pocket says so.

1532
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:02,140
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared

1533
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,670
because l sat on it in the car...

1534
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,600
...not because l printed it out recently.

1535
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,710
Let's pretend that's real.

1536
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,680
Want to explain what you're doing here?

1537
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,210
We...

1538
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,150
...are stopping a gross...

1539
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,720
...miscarriage ofjustice!

1540
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:25,590
That...

1541
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,660
Okay, if you'd just let me explain.

1542
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:28,850
l can explain this.

1543
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,620
lf you would just listen...

1544
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,660
l've got a letter from Mike O'Donnell,

1545
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:32,390
he's the husband in this case!

1546
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:33,560


1547
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,790


1548
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,230
l'm sorry. We're in the middle...

1549
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,730
Your Honor, if it's okay,

1550
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,500
 l'd like to hear the letter, please.

1551
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,210
Thank you, Your Honor.

1552
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,280
This is a letter from Mike O'Donnell.

1553
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:56,120
He wanted me to read it.

1554
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:01,390
''Scarlet...

1555
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:05,090
...before you go through with this...

1556
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:09,570
...l want to remind you of September 7th, 1988.

1557
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,940
lt was the first time that l saw you.

1558
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,170
You were reading Less Than Zero.

1559
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,180
You were wearing a Guns N' roses T shirt.

1560
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:28,520
l'd never seen anything so perfect.

1561
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:35,650
l remember thinking that l had to have you, or l'd die.

1562
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,860
Then you whispered that you loved me...

1563
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,670
...at the homecoming dance.

1564
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,740
And l felt...

1565
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,210
...so peaceful...

1566
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,080
...and safe.

1567
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:00,390
Because l knew that no matter what happened...

1568
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:04,320
...from that day on, nothing could ever be that bad.

1569
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,390
Because l had you.

1570
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,590
And then l grew up...

1571
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:16,470
...and l lost my way.

1572
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:21,810
And l blamed you for my failures.

1573
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,380
And l know that you think you have to do this today.

1574
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,010
l don't want you to.

1575
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,020
But l guess...

1576
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,330
...if l love you...

1577
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,960
...l should let you move on.''

1578
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,580
All right, son, you need to go now.

1579
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,530
Let's proceed.

1580
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,760
l'm sorry, Your Honor. Would it be okay...

1581
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:28,340
...if we postpone this for now for just a little while?

1582
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:30,440
Would that be okay?

1583
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:33,310
Postponed 30 days. Next case.

1584
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:40,550


1585
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,850


1586
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:01,810
Haven't seen you practice this hard since school.

1587
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,100
Yeah, you know, if l want to impress these college scouts...

1588
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,580
...then l need to stay focused.

1589
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,440
Wait, wait. You're not still trying

1590
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,780
 to get a scholarship, are you?

1591
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,650
Be careful, man.

1592
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,950
You do not want to get off of the spirit path.

1593
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,210
There's no path, Ned!

1594
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,250
There's no path!

1595
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:20,550
l can't do it!

1596
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:22,420
l just made it worse for them.

1597
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,120
My wife is happier, everyone's happier with me out of the picture,

1598
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,990
 Ned.

1599
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:30,100
lt's time to move on.

1600
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,530


1601
01:27:53,330 --> 01:28:00,160


1602
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,230
lt's time to go, Mom.

1603
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,910
Hey, Gold, save something for the game, huh?

1604
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,050
Just warming up, coach.

1605
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,490
Got a little inside info for you.

1606
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,630
The scout from Ohio State is back,

1607
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,420
and the coach is with him.

1608
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,930
You play half the game l know you're capable of...

1609
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:35,130
...you're going to be playing college ball next year, huh?

1610
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,360
That's the plan, coach.

1611
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,940
- Give me the ball.

1612
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,840
All right, gather up, jockstraps. Picture time.

1613
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,980
Try not to break the camera.

1614
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,990
l can't wait to go to Georgetown

1615
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,390
 and start dating college boys.

1616
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,630
l thought Mark was hanging out with Alex to get to me,

1617
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,270
not you.

1618
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,600
All right, ladies, let's bring it in.

1619
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:49,340
Jane!

1620
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,140
 Jane!

1621
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,470
Jane!

1622
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:53,630
 l'm sorry, sorry.

1623
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:56,410
Ned, Ned, Ned. - Oh, sorry.

1624
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,210
Ned. Yeah. Hi.

1625
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,440
 - Hi.

1626
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,020
 - Hi.

1627
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,380
l need to talk to you.

1628
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:02,820
- What are you doing?

1629
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,790
l practiced this, uh.

1630
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,690
Okay.

1631
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,520
l have just seen my best friend lose everything than means anything to him.

1632
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:15,640
And maybe we'll never be there, but...

1633
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,360
Yes, l understand,

1634
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,510
but l have told you before that l am the principal...

1635
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,800
Yes. ...and l cannot be seen...

1636
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,640
...with my students' parents.

1637
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,910
But, Jane, how can you be seen with me...

1638
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,640
...when l'm wearing the cloak of invisibility?

1639
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,260
Jane, all l'm asking is a chance for us to be friends.

1640
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,330
Because you're the one l want by my side...

1641
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:45,520
...when l'm storming the Elvish Castle of Ganakinesh.

1642
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,030
You can plunder my dungeon anytime.

1643
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,400
l'll bring my long bow.

1644
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,310
Warriors! Yeah!

1645
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:03,140
Come on.

1646
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,660
Oh, my God.

1647
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:22,100
Mom? Are you okay?

1648
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:25,290
l can't be here again. l have to go.

1649
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,180
But the game. That's your future..

1650
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,990
 -  No, the baby's my future.

1651
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:49,890
That's crazy, Mike.

1652
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:50,650
You're my future.

1653
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:52,160
 No, l can't let you throw this all away.

1654
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:52,890
Bye, Mike.

1655
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:56,040
High school star. Never quite lived up to potential.

1656
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,070
What are you doing?

1657
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,500
Of course l want to live in the past.

1658
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:01,730
l'll bet you wish you had it to do all over again.

1659
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,170
Hello?!

1660
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,680
lt's a classic transformation story.

1661
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,470
Spirit guide?

1662
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,180
You and me, we're in this together.

1663
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:15,010
lt's your turn now.

1664
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,190
Traveling.

1665
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,990
Green ball!

1666
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,160
O'Donnell, get in there!

1667
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,990
Scarlet!

1668
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,970
Scar?

1669
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,970
Scarlet?

1670
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,990
lt is you.

1671
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,260
Hi.

1672
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:06,160
Hi?

1673
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,180
l can explain.

1674
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:11,710
You can?

1675
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,210
No, not at all.

1676
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:16,680
You didn't have to come after me again.

1677
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:19,940
 - Yes, l did, because l love you.

1678
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,710
You're the best decision l ever made,

1679
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:23,750
 l just forgot.

1680
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:27,490
And then l fell off a bridge

1681
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,180
and things got pretty weird after that.

1682
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,160
But l'm never going to forget again.

1683
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:37,260
Look, l know that l've been in a bad mood for the last...

1684
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,740
...20 years.

1685
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,070
But if you let me, l swear,

1686
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,730
 l will spend the rest of my life making it up to you.

1687
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:48,680
l thought l wanted a second chance at life...

1688
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,480
...but now l know l just want a second chance with y...

1689
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,680
Weird.

1690
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:59,620
Yeah.

1691
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:02,790
l missed you.

1692
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,000
Yeah, l'm gonna put you down

1693
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:15,130
because this was a lot easier before.

1694
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:18,680
Yeah, you did have that six- pack thing going.

1695
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:20,540
ls there any chance l'll see that again?

1696
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:23,650
l knew you were checking me out.

1697
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:30,180
Go! Go! Go!

1698
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,590
Adults can have that, though.

1699
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:37,160
Well, l'll work on it. Maybe l'll jog home.

1700
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:44,770


1701
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,990
Ned, hey.

1702
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:47,260
l packed up all my stuff

1703
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,570
and l wanted to give your key back and say thanks.

1704
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,270
Hey, whoa. No. No.

1705
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,610
Wasn't expecting to see you there, Principal Masterson.

1706
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,180
You look very pretty.

1707
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,150
Thank you.

1708
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,980
The Force is strong in this one.

1709
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:02,720
So l guess l'll be seeing you at work, boss.

1710
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,490
Oh, yes, uh, Coach O'Donnell.

1711
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:09,450
And, um, we are very happy to have you aboard.

1712
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:11,490
Buddy, l got you a little something

1713
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,690
for your first day at your new job.

1714
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:14,830
Don't think about how much it cost, it's not much.

1715
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:21,160
Hey, you got me a whistle.

1716
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,270
Don't blow it.

1717
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:27,040
Play big.

1718
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,650
You too.

1719
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:31,680
Good luck. Love you!

1720
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,440
Love you!
