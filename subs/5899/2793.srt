为何你不能告诉我你要去哪儿？

防止它们落入敌手

那是你给他的任务

00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,335
你来干嘛？
What do you want?

141
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,495
来看你
To see you.

142
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,455
四个月后才来？
After four months?

143
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,095
得了吧
Forget it.

144
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,455
你说得对
You're right.

145
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,575
我还没告诉你我是谁
I haven't told you who I am.

146
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,855
我做什么的
What I'm doing.

147
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:18,294
为什么我消失了
Why I disappear.

148
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,214
但是我从没对你撒谎
But I never told you lies.

149
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,654
是没，但是...
No, but ...

150
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,454
这都四个月了
for four months.

151
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,014
我会解释的
I'll try to explain,

152
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,614
如果你愿意听的话
if you're willing to listen.

153
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,333
你曾化作俄国人
You have lived as Russian

154
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,173
跟武器走私犯住一起？
with weapons smugglers?

155
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:06,533
你是个间谍
You're a spy.

156
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,853
我是个情报人员
I'm an intelligence officer.

157
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:13,413
是的
Yes

158
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:16,973
我还以为你是搞婚外恋什么的
I thought you were cheating on your wife or something like that.

159
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,372
自我走后我就每天都在想你
I've thought about you every day since I left.

160
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:31,932
如果你不想这样过日子
I understand if you can't handle it anymore.

161
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,972
如果你不想见我我也理解
If you don't want to see me.

162
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,332
但是我想见你
But I wanted to see you.

163
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:45,732
当我出差在外时
When I was over there,

164
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,651
这段时间，它...
this time, it ...

165
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,491
它让我想了很多
it made me think.

166
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:57,451
想了什么？
About what?

167
00:22:57,932 --> 00:22:59,571
我想改变我的生活
That I want to change my life.

168
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,091
你想变成怎样的？
What would you change it to?

169
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,131
我想跟你一起生活
I want to live my life with you.

170
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:22,450
那就是我想干的
That's what I want to do.

171
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,370
其他事我都做完了
I've done the other.

172
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,010
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

173
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,408
我们在索马里出了点问题
We have a problem in Somalia.

174
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:29,128
我们在等政府的许可命令
We are waiting for the go-ahead from the government,

175
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:31,128
等着通知该如何处理
about how it should be handled.

176
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,208
我会安排好给你所有信息的
I will arrange it so that you get all the info.

177
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,688
这可能跟阿富汗有关
It might be a link to Afghanistan.

178
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,808
准备再去一次吧
Get ready to go again.

179
00:24:40,969 --> 00:24:42,688
你跟踪我了？
Are you having me followed?

180
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,088
不
No.

181
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:46,808
- 不是我认识的人 - 我会查查看的
<i>- It's not someone I recognize. - I'll check it out.</i>

182
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:51,288
我也会查查玛丽的
And I'll check out Mary as well.

183
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:55,647
她是离开瑞典前你接触的最后一人
She was the last one you were with before you left Sweden.

184
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,207
你到底是怎么知道这事的？
How the hell do you know about that?

185
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:01,407
- 你觉得她跟这事有关？ - 你认为呢？
- Do you think that she's involved? - What do you think?

186
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:03,647
我认为你错了
I think you're wrong.

187
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,847
我会过去的
I'm coming.

188
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:06,007
注意安全
Be careful.

189
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:07,407
拜
Bye.

190
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,567
我刚在打电话
I'm on call.

191
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:15,167
我有个紧急手术，所以我得...
I have an emergency surgery, so I have to go into ...

192
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,567
好的
Ok.

193
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:20,407
你呆在这儿！
You stay here!

194
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:23,447
待会我会做早饭
I'm going to make breakfast later.

195
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:16,997
首相办公室，斯德哥尔摩
Prime Minister's Office. Stockholm.

196
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:28,637
那我们不知道拉格贝克在哪？
So we don't know where Lagerback is?

197
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,717
或是他是否还活着？
Or whether he's alive?

198
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,596
你有什么新消息吗？
Have you gotten any new information?

199
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,796
是的，拉格贝克在索马里
Yes. Lagerback is in Somalia.

200
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,836
遭关押了
Imprisoned.

201
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,956
- 遭关押了？ - 是
- Imprisoned? Yes.

202
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,116
好吧
Yep.

203
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:50,396
克拉斯・奥洛夫松
Clas Olofsson.

204
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,356
拉格贝克在埃塞俄比亚干嘛的？
What was Lagerback doing in Ethiopia?

205
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,996
拉格贝克当时在那做私人旅行
Lagerback was there on a personal trip.

206
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,676
他在索马里边境失踪
He disappeared on the border with Somalia.

207
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,636
作为私人旅行目的地来说
Isn't that an extremely dangerous region

208
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,476
那不是非常危险的区域吗？
to choose as a private destination?

209
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:04,236
当前我们没有关于他囚禁情况的进一步消息
We have no further details about his captivity at the moment.

210
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,555
您认为他的失踪
Do you think that his work with you on

211
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:09,075
跟你们一起做的高科技武器研究
advanced high-tech weapons may have something

212
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,075
- 可能有关吗？ - 不，我不这样认为
- to do with his disappearance? - No. I don't think so.

213
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,355
但是这确实是个不容忽视的疑点
But that's a suspicion that's just hard to ignore.

214
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:16,555
您作为北佛斯的副主任，应该知道
You as deputy director at the North Fors, should really know

215
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:18,435
他在那儿做什么
what he was doing there.

216
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,395
马丁・拉格贝克负责“教学任务”
Martin Lagerback worked with education.

217
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,315
所有北佛斯工业的员工都希望政府
All of us at the North Fors Industries hope that the government

218
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:28,835
尽全力营救以使其尽快与家人团聚
do their utmost so that he may soon be reunited with his family.

219
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:31,715
首相阁下，您认为此事会
Do you think, Prime Minister, that this

220
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,635
影响即将召开的和平会议吗？
can get in the way of the coming peace conference?

221
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:38,114
此外，受此影响，埃塞俄比亚总理约瑟夫・贝克勒
This, among other things, Ethiopia's prime minister, Josef Bekele

222
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,274
- 会出席会议吗？ - 开炮！
- will be there? - Fire!

223
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,834
此次会议是约瑟夫・贝克勒
The conference is an opportunity for Josef Bekele

224
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:47,954
和其他政党在该地区共创稳定局面的机会
and the other parties to create stability in the region.

225
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:51,834
作为部长，因为牵涉到北佛斯工业
Will you, as Minister, now take a closer look at your appointments

226
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,494
您打算履行职责
since North Fors Industries is involved,

227
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,994
彻查它们是否与
in order to see if there are links

228
00:31:55,115 --> 00:31:58,114
- 该地区国家有关吗？ - 额，不
- to the countries in the region? - Hmm, uh, no.

229
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:02,594
因为拉格贝克的失踪与它们的生意无关
Since Lagerback's disappearance has nothing to do with business.

230
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:04,594
- 所以.... - 我问的不是那个
- So ... - That's not what I asked.

231
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:09,553
政府不打算调查北佛斯否认
Will the government not investigate North Fors' denial that Lagerback

232
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,393
拉格贝克公费前往埃塞俄比亚谈生意的声明吗？
was there in Ethiopia on business at their expense?

233
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,193
瑞典牵涉到该地区
The idea that Sweden would be involved

234
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:17,993
武器贸易的说法纯属无稽之谈
in the handling of weapons in the region is ridiculous.

235
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:19,913
瑞典从未
Sweden has never

236
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:23,833
也绝不会允许向交战国家出售武器
and will never approve weapons to warring countries.

237
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,632
那你认为我们该雇佣安保公司？
So you think we should employ a security company?

238
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:51,192
派雇佣兵去救拉格贝克？
A private army to rescue Lagerback?

239
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:54,072
嗯，但不是我们，而是北佛斯工业
Mmm. Well no, not us, but North Fors Industries.

240
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,192
克拉斯・奥洛夫松联系我提供了这个建议
Clas Olofsson contacted me and suggested this idea.

241
00:32:58,473 --> 00:32:59,672
这具体要怎么操作？
How would it really take place?

242
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,552
萨拉...
Sara ...

243
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:04,672
让塞彻贡处理吧，他们是专业的
let Sectragon take care of this. They are pros.

244
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:07,951
两年前
Two years ago,

245
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,551
塞彻贡救出了
Sectragon saved

246
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:13,231
6个援建哥伦比亚的荷兰工人
six Dutch aid workers in Colombia,

247
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:17,671
并且去年在摩加迪沙救了两个法国医生
and last year there were two French doctors in Mogadishu.

248
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,711
我需要瑞典人
I want a Swedish person.

249
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:27,351
一个对这种事有经验的人
Someone with experience in situations like this.

250
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,711
好的
Yes.

251
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:36,111
凶手带走了一些照片
The killer has taken some photographs.

252
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,190
可能是与她有关的某个波兰人
Probably someone from Poland who contacted her.

253
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,630
我相信凶手在故意误导我们
I believe that the killer is trying to lead us astray.

254
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:47,070
玛利亚醒过来
Maria had awakened.

255
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:49,150
她被电话叫到医院
She was called to come in,

256
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,070
在23:45时
at 23:45.

257
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,790
离开前她为何要整理床铺？
Why would she make her bed before she left?

258
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,950
是的，也许她并没睡觉
Yes, perhaps she had not gone.

259
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:59,430
- 是吧？ - 不，不
What? - No no.

260
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,110
值班医生会在休息时尽量多睡
The doctor on duty sleeps when she can.

261
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:07,590
她怎么买得起这公寓？
How did she afford this apartment?

262
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,389
值班医生
The doctor on duty,

263
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,469
你知道的...“好工作，好生活”
You know ... "Go to work, get a life."

264
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,589
你的飞机两小时内起飞
Your plane leaves in about two hours.

265
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,949
你先看，然后我们谈谈细节
Read, then we'll go over the details.

266
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:44,308
警方有什么动静？
What do the police think?

267
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,308
你让凶案看起来跟波兰有关
You made it look like the killer has links to Poland.

268
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,908
公寓很干净，没有凶器
The apartment is clean, the murder weapon is gone

269
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:53,348
没有犯罪证据
there is no incriminating evidence.

270
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,148
玛丽是无辜的
Mary was innocent.

271
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,668
你不忘记这事就没法开展工作
You can't do this, unless you can get past this.

272
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,987
萨马塔・拉希姆
Samata Rahim.

273
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:22,947
索马里流亡政治家
Somalian exiled politician.

274
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,827
他昨天在炸弹袭击中身亡
He was killed in a bomb attack yesterday.

275
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,307
无人声明对此负责
No one has accepted the blame.

276
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:31,187
看看吧
Take a look.

277
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:34,867
马丁・拉格贝克

418
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,916
为什么塞彻贡要在索马里培养恐怖分子？
Why is Sectragon supplying terrorists in Somalia?

419
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:15,756
他们已准备好去世界各地了
They are prepared to go all the way.

420
00:51:16,637 --> 00:51:18,756
需要的话他们会使用任何必要手段
By any means necessary if they have to.

421
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:23,676
我不会再说一个字了
I'm not saying another word.

422
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,876
要么你带我去瑞典
Either you take me to Sweden with you ...

423
00:51:29,997 --> 00:51:33,196
要么你把我留在这，你选吧
Or you leave me here. Your choice.

424
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:36,596
我们会保护你的
We'll protect you.

425
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:46,155
你别动
You stay put.

426
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,995
汉密尔顿先生？我是查德
Mr. Hamilton? I'm Chad.

427
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:01,875
莫娜让我代她问好
Mona sends her regards.

428
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:03,155
跟我走吧
So walk with me.

429
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:10,394
里，这是查德
Lee, this is Chad.

430
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,234
你跟他走
You go with him.

431
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:19,674
我们待会在阿曼碰面
We'll meet later in Amman.

432
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:30,594
斯德哥尔摩

瑞典政府已安排遭绑架的马丁・拉格贝克回国

434
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:36,434
他曾在索马里遭囚禁
He was been imprisoned in Somalia.

435
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:39,594
伊斯兰激进组织青年党
And the militant
Islamist group Al-Shabab

436
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:42,793
今天声称对索马里流亡政治家
took credit today for the murder of the exiled Somali

437
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:46,233
萨马塔・拉希姆和他家人遭袭事件负责
politician Samata Rahim and his family.

438
00:52:46,354 --> 00:52:49,673
埃塞俄比亚情报部门认为此次袭击
The Ethiopian intelligence service thinks the strike took place

439
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:52,673
使用了称作天幕的瑞典制GPS制导炮弹
with a Swedish GPS guided shell known as a Sky Shadow.

440
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:56,553
美国军方领导表示该地区情势令人担忧
U.S. military leaders think the development in the area is disturbing.

441
00:52:56,874 --> 00:53:00,233
基地组织和青年党都在索马里根基稳固
Both Al Qaeda and Al-Shabab have strong roots in Somalia.

442
00:53:00,434 --> 00:53:03,113
而现在他们手握高科技武器
And they now have high-tech weapons

443
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:05,593
及其使用方法
and knowledge of how to use them.

444
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:08,013
非洲问题专家简・埃里克・兰姆佛斯表示
This implies a changing power shift, according to the

445
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:10,313
这意味着该地势力格局正发生改变
African Foreign Ministry expert, Jan Erik Ramfors.

446
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:22,472
我要你彻查到底
I want you to get to the bottom of this.

447
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:25,272
我要你去调查

448
00:53:25,393 --> 00:53:30,392
北佛斯工业近年来涉及到的所有生意

449
00:53:30,394 --> 00:53:31,712
我想知道这到底是怎么发生的
I want to know exactly how this happened.

450
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:35,512
你认为克拉斯・奥洛夫松掌握着我们不知道的事情？
Do you think Clas Olofsson knows something we don't?

451
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,552
他觉得救回拉格贝克非常轻松
He was very relaxed about getting home Lagerback.

452
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:45,151
若结果证明其中有任何违法行为
If it turns out that there have been any illegalities

453
00:53:45,712 --> 00:53:48,231
我可不想从电视里听到
I don't want to find out about it on TV.

454
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:49,551
是
Yes.

455
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:04,431
哈喽？
Hello?

456
00:54:07,272 --> 00:54:08,311
哈喽？
Hello?

457
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:09,991
嗨
Hi

458
00:54:10,712 --> 00:54:14,031
嘿，我是警局的安娜・如纳
Hey, I'm Anna Rune from the police.

459
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,510
我想知道你是否...
I wonder if you ...

460
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:18,990
认识这个女人？
recognize this woman?

461
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:24,430
认识，她来过这儿，跟一个男的，他们就坐在那儿
Yes, she was here, with some man... They sat there.

462
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,950
好的，这个男的...
Okay, this man had ...

463
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:30,390
阿曼，约旦
Amman, Jordan.

464
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,827
- 我们不是该明天见面吗？ - 是的
- Aren't we supposed to meet tomorrow? - Yes.

465
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:50,867
但是塔里克有些疑问
But Tareq has some questions.

466
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:54,187
- 塔里克？ - 谁是本杰明・里？
- Tareq? - Who is Benjamin Lee?

467
00:55:54,588 --> 00:55:56,027
他为塞彻贡工作
He worked for Sectragon.

468
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,747
他有关乎瑞典国家安全的情报
He has information regarding Swedish security.

469
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:00,667
他替他们卖命？
He works for them?

470
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,627
那他怎么上了美国的恐怖分子名单？
So how come he's listed as a terrorist in the U.S.?

471
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:12,227
任何帮助本杰明・里的人都会被视为恐怖分子
Anyone that helps Benjamin Lee will be tagged as a terrorist.

472
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:19,066
塞彻贡关系深厚，所以他才上了名单
Sectragon has contacts, that's why he's on that list.

473
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:22,266
名单的目的在于吓唬你这种人
The purpose of that list is to scare people like you.

474
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:25,466
你记得查德吗？
Do you remember Chad?

475
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:26,986
是啊
Yea.

476
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:29,266
那个在索马里帮你的人
The guy who helped you in Somalia.

477
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:31,106
他失踪了
He's missing.

478
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:33,306
如果查德开口，汉密尔顿先生
If Chad talks, Mr. Hamilton,

479
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:34,826
这就不止关系到你了
it's not going to be about you.

480
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:38,266
巴解组织必须置身事外 （巴勒斯坦解放组织）
The PLO must be out of this.

481
00:56:39,507 --> 00:56:41,826
我们要用里来换查德
We will trade Lee for Chad.

482
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:43,546
塔里克，拜托
Tareq, please.

483
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:46,266
我能和莫娜单独呆会吗？
Can I have a moment alone with Mona?

484
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:51,145
别再讨论这事了
Don't discuss it any further.

485
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:53,785
这跟我们无关
This is none of our business.

486
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:56,025
好的，塔里克，我会处理的
Ok, Tareq. I will handle this.

487
00:56:57,226 --> 00:56:59,745
我希望我们尽快结束这事，汉密尔顿先生
I hope we finish this soon, Mr. Hamilton.

488
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:03,305
- 拜 - 拜
- Bye. - Bye.

489
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:10,865
你知道自己惹了世上最大的佣兵部队吗？
Are you aware that you have provoked the largest private army in the world?

490
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:13,985
嗯，我知道
Well, it crossed my mind.

491
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:19,465
我找不到任何他跟塞彻贡有关的信息，所以
I could not find any information to link him to Sectragon, so

492
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:21,304
塔里克说得对
Tareq is right.

493
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:23,464
这不关我们的事，巴解组织
This is none of our business and the PLO

494
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,464
绝不可以跟恐怖分子有瓜葛
must not be associated with terrorists.

495
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:27,584
他不是恐怖分子
He is not a terrorist.

496
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:30,584
你觉得我不相信他的话我还会来吗？
Do you think I'd be here if I didn't believe in him?

497
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:34,984
他们不会放过你的，知道吗？
They're not going to leave you, you know?

498
00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:38,464
等这事完了他们就会来追杀你
They're going to come after you when this is over.

499
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:45,024
你知道我干这行已经20多年了
You know I've been in this business for over 20 years now,

500
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:47,344
一般来说，我都该退休了
Statistically, my time is up.

501
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:55,103
我需要用你的关系把里弄出约旦
I need your contacts to get Lee out of the country.

502
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:00,943
我需要你相信我
I need you to trust me.

503
00:58:04,824 --> 00:58:05,903
我相信
I do.

504
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:13,623
索马里
Somalia.

505
00:58:27,183 --> 00:58:28,782
冈萨尔斯，起来！
Gonzalez ... Up!

506
00:58:33,063 --> 00:58:34,102
你有个妹妹
You've got a sister,

507
00:58:34,823 --> 00:58:36,222
快招，否则下一个就是她了
talk or she'll be here next.

508
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:40,862
在阿曼...

509
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:42,342
跟谁一起？
With who?

00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,142
跟谁一起？
With who?

511
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:56,581
想象下你的妹妹在这跟我一起吧...
Think about your sister ... Here with me.

512
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:02,421
你在阿曼的联络人是谁？
Who's your contact in Amman?

513
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:06,381
莫娜...

00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,021
莫娜・阿尔法沙和一个男的
Mona Al-Fatha. And a man.

515
00:59:17,462 --> 00:59:20,541
阿曼，约旦

516
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:46,300
萨拉姆・阿雷库目
Salam Aleikum.

517
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:53,020
里在哪？你带我去找他
Where is Lee. You take me to him.

518
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,939
- 看来要下次了 - 你失败过一次了
- Another time. - You failed before.

519
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,219
乌兹别克斯坦和阿富汗的边境
The border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

520
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,419
原来是你
It was you.

521
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,739
等我干掉里
When I'm finished with Lee,

522
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:24,858
我就去找你
I'm coming for you.

523
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,738
这是上帝的旨意
As God wants.

524
01:00:40,939 --> 01:00:41,858
喂
Hello.

525
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:48,898
你看到他了？
You got him?

526
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:52,818
我可以干掉汉密尔顿，重复，我可以干掉汉密尔顿
I can take out Hamilton, repeat, I can take out Hamilton.

527
01:00:57,978 --> 01:01:01,697
不，他能带我们找到里，我们待会再干掉他
No, he'll lead us to Lee. We'll take him out later.

528
01:01:01,818 --> 01:01:02,697

如果要人们为你牺牲性命

为什么我朋友会死？

我希望值得救他

546
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,089

告诉我所有你知道的
tell me everything you know.

554
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:54,168
战争对于塞彻贡这样的组织来说利润丰厚
War is extremely profitable for an organization like Sectragon.

555
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:59,528
五角大楼在伊拉克已经支付了超过100亿美元给私人军事承包商
Pentagon has fed over $10 billion to private contractors in Iraq.

556
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:02,168
青年党将再次发动袭击
The world is waiting for Al-Shabab to strike again.

557
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:06,567
而我知道时间和地点
And I know when and where that'll happen.

558
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,287
哈特的队伍会执行这次行动
Hart's team will carry out the operation.

559
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,407
不过青年党会为此负责
But Al-Shabab will get the blame.

560
01:06:13,448 --> 01:06:14,847
他们要做什么？
What will they do?

561
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:18,247
等我安全了我就给你更多情报
I'll give you more information when I'm in safety.

562
01:06:22,528 --> 01:06:24,527
你在中情局的恐怖分子名单上
You are on the CIA's terrorist list.

563
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:27,487
塞彻贡跟中情局有关系
Sectragon has contacts in the CIA.

564
01:06:28,848 --> 01:06:31,007
我能做什么？
- What can I do?

565
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:33,167
要求跟我们的首相谈话吧
- Demand to speak to our extra trial Prime Minister.

566
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:36,726
这是你唯一脱身的机会
That's your only chance to get through to the right people.

567
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:37,606
好的
Ok.

568
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:40,326
机场受到监视了
The airport is under surveillance.

569
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:43,806
所以我们要带你去大马士革，你从那起飞
So we take you to Damascus. You fly from there.

570
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:46,766
阿布・奥马，给我点东西盖上他
Abu Omar, give me something to cover him.

571
01:07:28,286 --> 01:07:30,845
斯德哥尔摩群岛
Stockholm's archipelago.

572
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,883
里先生，欢迎
Mr. Lee ... Welcome.

573
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:16,443
现在没你的事了，汉密尔顿
Your business is finished now, Hamilton.

574
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:21,323
这边请
This way please.

575
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:37,842
我已经跟你说了，长官
I've already told you sir,

576
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:40,962
除非我能直接跟首相对话
Only if I can speak directly with the prime minister

577
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:45,162
我才会说出任何关于塞彻贡的情报
will I speak about any information concerning Sectragon.

578
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:51,522
我认为你的谈判手段并不高明
I don't think your negotiation tactics serves you well,

579
01:08:51,963 --> 01:08:54,402
因为中情局发现你处于瑞典保护
beacause it's only a matter of time before the

580
01:08:54,404 --> 01:08:56,842
之前只是时间问题
CIA finds out that you in Swedish custody.

581
01:09:01,923 --> 01:09:03,322
你得牢记这点！
You remember that!

582
01:09:07,762 --> 01:09:10,641
是有件事，她后来晚上给我打了电话
There was one thing, she called me later in the night.

583
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:14,001
她忘带她的电脑了，想让我保管好
She had forgotten her computer and wanted me to look after it.

584
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:17,321
- 你现在有吗？ - 是的，这边
- Do you have it here? - Yes, come here.

585
01:09:25,882 --> 01:09:28,401
额，这是那个跟玛丽一起的男人
Ehm, this is the man who was there with Mary.

586
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,841
我们有两个目击者能证实
We have two witnesses who can verify it.

587
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,361
我想知道我是否能在媒体上公布这个照片？
I want to know if I can publish this picture in the press?

588
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:35,841
- 等一会 - 为什么？
- Wait for a bit. - Why?

589
01:09:36,762 --> 01:09:39,641
额，我得核实些事情
Ehh ... There's something I have to check.

590
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:41,360
核实什么？
Check what?

591
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:45,520
我说的不够清楚吗？我说的你还有不明白的吗？
Was I unclear? Was there anything I said you don't understand?

592
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:52,570
- 你知道凶手是谁，是吗？ - 先别管了，别管了
- You know who it is don't you? - Back off for now, back off.

593
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,120
北佛斯工业，斯德哥尔摩
North Fors Industries, Stockholm.

594
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,000
外交部没批准过任何
The Foreign Ministry has not approved any

595
01:10:04,002 --> 01:10:05,720
非法终端用户证书
end-user certificates that have not been correct.

596
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:08,600
没有任何“私下交易”
There are no "hidden appointments"

597
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:12,360
没有贿赂，没有跟北佛斯有关的走私案
no bribes ... No smuggling that can be connected to North Fors.

598
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,959
调查期间只会发现一个小细节
There's just one small detail that will show up during an investigation.

599
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,759
什么？
What?

600
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,459
是你一年前促成了
That it was you who pushed through the Sky

601
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:22,239
与匈牙利的天幕出售合约
Shadow agreement with Hungary a year ago.

602
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,999
是的，不过那完全是照章办事
Yes, but it was completely by the book.

603
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,319
- 是的 - 是的
- Yes. - Yes.

604
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,839
而现在它们失踪了
And now they are gone.

605
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,559
你却还没收到钱
And you have not been paid.

606
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,759
现在青年党正在索马里使用它们
And now they are being used by Al-Shabab in Somalia.

607
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,919
但是，但是等一下，你到底在说什么啊？
But, but wait a minute, what the hell are you saying now?

608
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,359
什么？克拉斯，什么意思？
What? Clas, what the hell?

609
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:43,758
瑞典情报部正保护一个男人
Swedish intelligence has a man in their custody.

610
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:48,278
他知道这一切
He knows all about this.

611
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:52,278
- 好的，那，那他是谁？ - 他叫本杰明・里
- Yes, and, and who is it? - His name is Benjamin Lee.

612
01:10:52,919 --> 01:10:54,878
他要说出他所知的一切
And he's going to tell everything he knows.

613
01:10:56,599 --> 01:11:00,278
本杰明・里需要瑞典政府的保证
So Benjamin Lee will need guarantees from the Swedish government.

614
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,118
- 他想要一个新身份和保护 - 嗯
- He wants a new identity and protection. - Mmmm.

615
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:07,998
他只会跟你私下直接对话
And he will only talk directly with you, personally.

616
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:09,798
好的，这没问题
Well that's not a problem.

617
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:11,597
不幸的是
Well unfortunately,

618
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:15,397
美国已经把他列为恐怖分子
the U.S. has listed him as a terrorist.

619
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,277
本杰明・里知道
Benjamin Lee knows,

620
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:22,917
他们是如何一步步将非洲之角引入战争边缘
how step by step they are setting the stage for a war in Horn of Africa.

621
01:11:23,038 --> 01:11:26,117
但是这些都是恐怖分子说的
But these claims come from a terrorist.

622
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,397
有什么证据吗？
Is there any evidence?

623
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,917
没！
No!

624
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,677
- 本杰明・里是可信的 - 他可信？
- Benjamin Lee is credible. - So, he's credible?

625
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,997
我们要忽视中情局的信息吗？
Are we suppossed to ignore information that comes from the CIA?

626
01:11:38,118 --> 01:11:40,397
塞彻贡在策划一次暗杀
Sectragon is planning an assassination

627
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:42,557
要让恐怖分子背这黑锅
where the blame is placed on terrorists.

628
01:11:43,397 --> 01:11:47,116
到时候，这地区的战争就不可避免了
When it happens, a war in the region is inevitable.

629
01:11:50,357 --> 01:11:51,636
找他来谈吧
Get him to talk.

630
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:55,316
周二，约瑟夫・贝克勒会出席和平会议
On Tuesday, Joseph Bekele will be at the peace conference.

631
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:57,396
我要知道本杰明・里了解的所有情况
I want to know everything that Benjamin Lee knows.

632
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:05,316
据美国军方高层称
According to sources in American military leadership

633
01:12:05,437 --> 01:12:07,916
索马里正举行一系列有计划的军事演习
there is a planned a series of military exercises in Somalia.

634
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:10,556
一直致力于推动非洲之角
Ethiopia's prime minister, Josef Bekele

635
01:12:10,677 --> 01:12:12,576
国家间和平发展的
who has worked for a peaceful development

636
01:12:12,577 --> 01:12:14,475
埃塞俄比亚总理约瑟夫・贝克勒
between countries in the Horn of Africa,

637
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,835
对该地区未来表示了担忧
is worried about the future of the region,

638
01:12:16,956 --> 01:12:19,555
他担心国家间将出现新的暴力冲突
and fears new violence between countries.

639
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:22,055
现在再把目光转向玛利亚・索斯卡医生
And we continue now with new information

640
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:23,715
谋杀案的最新消息
about the murder of Dr. Maria Solska.

641
01:12:23,836 --> 01:12:26,555
据警方发言人称，已有确切证据
According to a police spokesman, certain evidence has been found

642
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,075
证明此案与波兰有关
that shows there's a link to Poland

643
01:12:29,196 --> 01:12:31,715
玛利亚・索斯卡近年来曾11次前往该国
where Maria Solska had visited 11 times in recent years.

644
01:13:23,794 --> 01:13:24,593
卡尔！
Carl!

645
01:13:29,994 --> 01:13:31,753
我要你跟里谈谈
I want you to talk to Lee.

646
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,313
我的新上司说没我的事了
My new boss says I'm finished with it.

647
01:13:34,794 --> 01:13:37,753
你是唯一能让他开口的人
You're the only one who can get him to talk.

648
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:43,033
你是唯一本杰明信任的人
You are the only one Benjamin trusts.

649
01:13:45,393 --> 01:13:48,072
曾有个人也信任我，但她现在死了
There was another person who trusted me, but she's dead now.

650
01:13:48,673 --> 01:13:50,272
忘了玛利亚・索斯卡吧
Let Maria Solska go.

651
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:51,672
这是个意外
It was an accident.

652
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:54,912
这他妈不是意外，是条件反射
That was no fucking accident, it was a reflex.

653
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:56,552
你也很清楚这点
You know that as well.

654
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:59,512
20年来我一直在训练掌握它
I've been training to master it for 20 years.

655
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,912
它救了我很多次
It has saved my life many times.

656
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:05,312
一瞬间，我就杀了玛丽
It only took a split second ... I killed Mary.

657
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:07,112
你错了
You're wrong.

658
01:14:09,193 --> 01:14:10,752
明天
Tomorrow ...

659
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,312
我要去自首
I'm turning myself in.

660
01:14:15,433 --> 01:14:20,072
你确实有理由置身事外
You stand outside the system, and there's a good reason for it.

661
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:25,671
但在必要时你得保护国家利益
You should protect the nation's interests, when necessary.

662
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:32,471
我为了国家利益受训杀人
I am trained to kill in the nation's interest.

663
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,871
但是我做不到
But I can't.

664
01:14:37,112 --> 01:14:38,631
我再也做不到了
I can't anymore.

665
01:14:40,032 --> 01:14:41,671
我爱她
I loved her.

666
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:45,591
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

667
01:14:48,271 --> 01:14:52,510
也许正如你所说玛丽死于条件反射
Mary's death was perhaps ... a reflex as you say.

668
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:56,830
但是正是条件反射救了本杰明・里的命
But the same reflex saved
Benjamin Lee's life.

669
01:14:57,271 --> 01:15:00,830
所以我让你跟里谈谈
So I ask you talk to Lee.

670
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:04,110
去警察局前先把这事办了
<i>Do it before going to the police.</i>

671
01:16:46,628 --> 01:16:47,947
你太迟了
You're too late.

672
01:16:49,028 --> 01:16:50,947
我已经告诉他们所有有关袭击的事了
I already told them everything about the attack.

673
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:52,626
你跟谁说了？
Who have you told?

674
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:54,666
谁？
Who?

675
01:17:13,147 --> 01:17:14,666
本杰明・里不见了
Benjamin Lee is gone.

676
01:17:15,907 --> 01:17:18,946
下一步这样，我跟你和法曼碰面
Here's what we'll do, I will meet you and Vernman

677
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:22,226
我们有内奸，否则塞彻贡永远也找不到他
We have a leak ... Otherwise Sectragon would never have found him.

678
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,905
我们必须把他抢回来
We must get him back.

679
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:26,145
不，我来处理
No. I'll handle this.

680
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,425
现在我要照自己的方式来干
I do this my way now.

681
01:17:27,586 --> 01:17:29,905
卡尔，你是为我做事的
Carl, you work for me.

682
01:17:30,026 --> 01:17:30,985
你等我消息
You'll hear from me.

683
01:17:31,306 --> 01:17:33,145
你不能单干
You can't do this alone.

684
01:17:33,266 --> 01:17:35,865
我不是一个人
I'm not alone.

685
01:17:42,786 --> 01:17:44,505
你能给我解释下到底
Can you explain to me how the hell

686
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:46,145
塞彻贡怎么发现他在这的？
Sectragon could find him here?

687
01:17:47,586 --> 01:17:48,985
你怎么知道是他们？
How do you know it was them?

688
01:17:49,106 --> 01:17:50,385
还能是谁？
Who else could it be?

689
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:52,345
监控文件丢了
The monitoring files are gone.

690
01:17:53,785 --> 01:17:54,984
该死
Damn.

691
01:18:00,705 --> 01:18:01,464
谢谢
Thanks.

692
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,424
托马斯，我能跟你谈谈吗？
Thomas, can I have a word with you?

693
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:10,224
本杰明・里不见了，他可能死了
Benjamin Lee is gone. He may be dead.

694
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:14,424
三个负责他安全的瑞典士兵被杀
Three Swedish soldiers responsible for his safety were killed.

695
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:16,264
有人泄露了他的位置
Someone leaked where he was.

696
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:19,144
好吧
Well.

697
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,064
不，但是怎么...
No, but what ...

698
01:18:21,185 --> 01:18:23,904
只有我和你知道他在哪里
It was only you and I who knew where he was.

699
01:18:25,544 --> 01:18:27,623
天啊，萨拉，你在怀疑我吗？
But my god Sara, are you accusing me?

700
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,303
本杰明・里是个遭通缉的恐怖分子，我们都知道的
Benjamin Lee is a wanted terrorist, that's all we know.

701
01:18:33,704 --> 01:18:37,863
我们怎么能肯定不是情报部门某个人泄露了消息？
How do we know for sure that someone from our own Intelligence Service didn't do it?

702
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,523
或者，或者是本杰明・里杀了士兵之后跑了
Or, or if it was Benjamin Lee who killed our men and then ran ...

703
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:43,263
我们不能肯定
We don't know this.

704
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:46,463
是不能
No.

705
01:18:47,424 --> 01:18:48,983
但是我会查清楚的
But I'll figure it out now.

706
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:04,382
谢谢你帮我
Thank you for helping me.

707
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,302
我是为了塔里克才干的
I'm doing this for Tareq.

708
01:19:09,743 --> 01:19:13,022
- 那，你就躲在这？ - 是
- So, this is where you hide out? - Yea.

709
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:21,262
看见没？
See that?

710
01:19:21,863 --> 01:19:22,862
那里
There.

711
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:24,742
那是哈特
That's Hart.

712
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:27,381
是的，但是他怎么找到里的？
Yea, but how did he find Lee?

713
01:19:28,582 --> 01:19:29,901
有内奸吗？
Is there a leak?

714
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:31,181
是的，很明显
Yea, apparently.

715
01:19:32,622 --> 01:19:34,781
但是我从没听说什么袭击
But I never heard a word about an attack.

716
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:37,381
- 是啊，那他在撒谎了 - 他是为了求生
- Yea, but he's lying. - He had to survive.

717
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:40,981
只要哈特知道这点就会杀了他
And as soon as Hart realizes this, he will kill him.

718
01:19:41,822 --> 01:19:43,461
所以我们去找哈特
So we go for Hart.

719
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,301
他会指引我们找到里
He will lead the way to Lee.

720
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:10,220
你认识她？
Did you know her?

721
01:20:14,781 --> 01:20:16,940
是，她被杀了
Yea ... she was murdered.

722
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:20,380
谁干的？
Who did it?

723
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,619
发生了什么？
So what happened?

724
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,619
玛利亚・索斯卡？
Maria Solska?

725
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,219
她跟这事有关吗？
Is she involved with this?

726
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,699
她给塞彻贡做事吗？
Did she work for Sectragon?

727
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,059
不
No.

728
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,219
是你的错吗？
Was it your fault?

729
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:02,258
我割了她的喉咙
I slit her throat.

730
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:16,058
我能相信你吗？
Can I trust you?

731
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:18,338
什么？
What?

732
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:22,298
如果我们碰见哈特，打了起来
If we meet Hart and it comes to combat ...

733
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,018
我能相信你吗？
Can I trust you?

734
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:28,338
“我干这行已经快20年了”
"I've been doing this for almost 20 years now."

735
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,137
“一般来说，我都该退休了”
"Statistically, my time is up,"

736
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:35,417
这是你在阿曼对我说的，对吧？
- You said that to me back in Amman, didn't you?

737
01:21:35,419 --> 01:21:36,937
是我说的
- Yes, I did.

738
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,897
那么，这就是你的愿望？
So, is that what you prefer?

739
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,777
死在哈特手下？
A bullet from Hart?

740
01:21:44,418 --> 01:21:46,697
但是我可不想这样，卡尔
But this doesn't work for me, Carl.

741
01:21:57,018 --> 01:21:58,017
你知道吗
You know ...

742
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,016
我开始想象跟她一起的生活
I started to imagine a life with her ...

743
01:22:04,297 --> 01:22:05,256
生活？
A life?

744
01:22:05,977 --> 01:22:08,656
你是说就像普通生活那样？
You mean like just an ordinary life?

745
01:22:08,777 --> 01:22:11,176
- 就像那样 - 卡尔！
- Like, a life. - Carl!

746
01:22:12,617 --> 01:22:15,376
你就是你，为什么你不接受这些呢？
You are who you are, why can't you just accept it?

747
01:22:24,617 --> 01:22:25,976
她是无辜的
She was innocent.

748
01:22:26,937 --> 01:22:28,496
好吧，她不是唯一无辜的
Well she was not the only one.

749
01:22:30,456 --> 01:22:33,335
目前，卡尔，我只想知道
And right now Carl, the only thing I want to know is

750
01:22:33,696 --> 01:22:35,095
我是否能相信你
I can trust you or not.

751
01:22:36,896 --> 01:22:39,335
- 你明白吗？ - 是的
- Do you understand ? Yes

752
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:43,295
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

753
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:53,775
我在家，我们需要了解你知道什么
I'm at home, we need to know what you know.

754
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,055
给我回电
So call me.

755
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:03,775
你好！我找卡尔・汉密尔顿
Hello! I am looking for Carl Hamilton.

756
01:23:04,255 --> 01:23:05,494
干嘛？
What is it?

757
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,294
你没正面回答我的问题
That's a very vague answer to my question

758
01:23:11,895 --> 01:23:14,534
约翰娜，好的，请进
Johanna ... Yes, come in..

759
01:23:15,015 --> 01:23:17,254
- 卡尔在家吗？ - 不
- Is Carl at home? - No.

760
01:23:20,655 --> 01:23:22,654
你可以跟我说，我是他父亲
You can speak with me, I'm his father.

761
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,614
这孩子做什么了？
What has the boy done now?

762
01:23:25,815 --> 01:23:27,214
你不是他父亲
You are not his dad.

763
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:30,734
你怎么查到他的？
How did you track him?

764
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:32,174
通过你
Through you.

765
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,293
我跟你上司谈过了
I talked with your boss,

766
01:23:36,414 --> 01:23:39,773
我们昨天碰面后去看望了他
and then came to visit him when we met yesterday.

767
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:42,293
会面的起因就在于你
The reason for the meeting was initiated by you.

768
01:23:45,294 --> 01:23:46,453
我看到你了
I saw you.

769
01:23:47,534 --> 01:23:49,493
我在等你现身
I was just waiting for you to show up.

770
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:52,093
卡尔杀了一个女人，你认为保护他对吗？
Carl has killed a woman, do you think it's right to protect him?

771
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:54,853
如果真是这样的话
If this did happen,

772
01:23:56,534 --> 01:24:00,613
汉密尔顿是我们最有价值的人才
Hamilton is one of our most valuable assets.

773
01:24:01,334 --> 01:24:04,173
所以现在我跟你说，我只说一次
So now I ask you, and I ask only once

774
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:07,412
忘掉这个小过错吧
forget about this little crusade ...

775
01:24:09,533 --> 01:24:11,372
那么你认为我该不管这事？
So you think I should just drop it?

776
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,572
我说过一次了，不重复第二次！
One time I said, not two!

777
01:24:15,053 --> 01:24:16,612
可以走了吗？
Shall we go?

778
01:24:23,533 --> 01:24:26,092
塞彻贡总部，达拉斯
Sectragon Headquarters, Dallas.

779
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:27,812
里已经开口了
Lee has been talking.

780
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,212
影响如何？
And the damage?

781
01:24:31,253 --> 01:24:34,012
- 相对较小 - 尽力弥补吧
- Relatively small. - Do what you have to.

782
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:37,051
如果这牵涉到瑞典首相呢？
And if it involves the Swedish Prime Minister?

783
01:24:39,412 --> 01:24:42,611
约瑟夫・贝克勒会死的...只是不照原计划而已
Josef Bekele will die ... Just not how we planned it.

784
01:24:43,652 --> 01:24:46,251
不过他的死仍会造成同样的影响
But his death will have exactly the same impact.

785
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:50,051
你看，灵活多变就是我们这行基础
You see, flexibility is the cornerstone of our profession.

786
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:53,131
只要我们保持灵活性，就掌握控制权
If we remain flexible, we maintain control.

787
01:24:53,252 --> 01:24:55,811
- 控制权？ - 青年党会对此负责
- Control? - Al-Shabab will take the blame.

788
01:24:55,932 --> 01:24:58,331
而新的埃塞俄比亚政府会加入我们
And the new Ethiopian government will join us

789
01:24:58,452 --> 01:25:00,611
参与反恐战争
in the war against terror.

790
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,091
斯德哥尔摩
Stockholm.

791
01:25:11,931 --> 01:25:13,490
- 嗨！
- 上午好
Hi!
- Good morning.

792
01:25:13,611 --> 01:25:16,290
- 我早前打过电话订了房间 - 是的
- I called earlier and made a reservation. - Yes.

793
01:25:20,811 --> 01:25:22,370
房间能看到大桥吗？
Is this a room with a view of the bridge?

794
01:25:22,491 --> 01:25:24,410
当然，先生，我们帮你安排好了
Absolutely sir, we arranged that for you.

795
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,330
在5083房间
It's room 5083.

796
01:25:26,451 --> 01:25:27,530
欢迎里先生
Welcome Mr. Lee.

797
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,769
我们检查下计时器
Let's check the timings.

798
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,209
全部设置好了
All set and clear.

799
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,769
蓝色雷克萨斯车
Blue Lexus.

800
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:14,408
嘭
Boom.

801
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:17,488
一切正常，进入下一步
We're good to go.

802
01:26:39,888 --> 01:26:41,407
- 唾液和口水在上面了？ - 是的
- Saliva and DNA on this? - Yea.

803
01:26:41,528 --> 01:26:42,767
好的
Good.

804
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:44,207
嘿！
Hey!

805
01:26:44,568 --> 01:26:46,407
这威力太大了，会炸掉半个酒店的
It's too big, it'll take out half the hotel.

806
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,247
不会，这腰带有结构缺陷
No, there's a construction flaw in the belt.

807
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,967
他的部分头部和躯干会保持完整
Parts of his head and torso will remain intact.

808
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:52,687
给你腰带，长官
The belt sir.

809
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:56,327
哈特，哈特，你在干嘛？
Hart. Hart, wuts you doing?

810
01:26:58,848 --> 01:27:02,367
- 哈特，拜托，听我说 - 我们开战了
- Hart, please, listen to me. - We are at war.

811
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:03,887
你记得吗？
You remember that?

812
01:27:04,728 --> 01:27:06,667
拜托
- Please ...

813
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,607
约瑟夫・贝克勒将为伟大事业而死
- Josef Bekele will die, for the greater good.

814
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:13,286
为了让世界看清恐怖分子势力稳固会有什么后果
For the world to see what happens when terrorism takes a foothold.

815
01:27:16,007 --> 01:27:17,486
是你自作自受
You brought this on yourself.

816
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:22,086
在你炸死自己前，你会干掉两个国家首脑
You'll take out two heads of state, before you blow up yourself up.

817
01:27:24,647 --> 01:27:26,246
在你转头反抗我们时
You didn't see that coming, did you?

818
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:29,446
你没预见到这点吧，对吗？
When you turned yourself against us.

819
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:48,005
你是谁？
Who the hell are you?

820
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:51,325
等等
Wait ...

821
01:27:56,566 --> 01:27:57,885
你有用过武器吗？
Have you ever used weapons?

822
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,005
你有杀过人吗？
Have you killed anyone?

823
01:28:01,286 --> 01:28:04,845
16个人死在了乌兹别克斯坦和阿富汗边境
Sixteen people died on the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

824
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:08,125
一个家庭被天幕迫击炮炸死了
A family was wiped out by a Sky Shadow mortar

825
01:28:08,286 --> 01:28:09,565
就在索马里
in Somalia.

826
01:28:10,045 --> 01:28:11,484
是你杀了他们
You murdered them.

827
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:14,004
