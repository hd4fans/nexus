1
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,890
- Si. Bueno. - Family is everything.

2
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,970
No?

3
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,370
Now, do you love your son?

4
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,120
Si.

5
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,630
Now do you understand?

6
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,110
You have a $ 10 million insurance policy. I know that.

7
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,710
Georgina!

8
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,970
Obey me, I will loveyou. Come on.

9
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,970
That's how it works, huh?

10
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,260
- Simple. - That's right.

11
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,250
Mwah.

12
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,690
She got a sister?

13
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,110
How's business?

14
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,010
The Japanese are here in a big way.

15
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,030
Cheap labor, factory space.

16
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,970
But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.

17
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,150
I ferry them back and forth. They think I'm John Wayne.

18
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,110
- Ah. - Come on.

19
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,110
- I live like a king down here. - Yes, you do.

20
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,680
- You been workin'? - Yeah. No.

21
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,950
Nah. Been movin' around, you know.

22
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,040
Colombia, couple of places I can't name. Nothing catches my fancy.

23
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,010
Oh.

24
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,630
You think God will forgive us forwhat we've done?

25
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,260
- No. - You don't?

26
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,570
Me either.

27
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,450
- How long you staying? - I don't know. I just you know.

28
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,410
I wanted to see you, Ray, see how you're doin'.

29
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,200
You know, I came by on impulse.

30
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,850
Well, I could do with some impulse.

31
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,050
What happened?

32
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,250
Family paid the ransom

33
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,550
then they sent the kid home after a couple of days

34
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
minus an ear, of course.

35
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,370
Now every mother in Mexico City with a little bit of moneywants bigger and better bodyguards

36
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,340
my own wife included.

37
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,170
I hate to break it to you, but she's right. She's right.

38
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,840
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh, kidnap and ransom insurance.

39
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,200
I have a policy. A.I.G. My dad gave it to me.

40
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,550
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

41
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,490
But what are you gonna do in 60 days whenyou can't renew it?

42
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,820
- You can't because you don't have a bodyguard. - I had to let Emilio go.

43
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,940
You gotta please Lisa. I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

44
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,580
Look, a bodyguard's like anything else.

45
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,830
You get whatyou pay for, okay?

46
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,820
You could do this. You get one that's got a decent resume.

47
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,330
We're not looking for goddamn Superman here, right?

48
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,060
Get someone cheap till you renew the policy

49
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,840
and then, uh then fire the prick forwhatever. Incompetence.

50
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,170
All kidding aside, the most important thing is thatyour daughter goes back to school

51
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,310
and thatyourwife gets to save face.

52
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,150
This way, you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood.

53
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,100
That's right. A bodyguard. YourSpanish is good enough.

54
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,600
- You're crazy. - You even look the part.

55
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,170
I n my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

56
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,080
It's rich guys flashing their cash. It's all forshow.

57
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,210
- Nothing's gonna happen. - Yeah? You think they'd hire a drunk, a has- been?

58
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,300
You have to keep it under control.

59
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,400
What if there was, you know, say, a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

60
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,400
You do your best. They're not gonna be payingyou enough to perform miracles.

61
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,990
- I don't know. - It's not exactly a scam, Crease.

62
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,260
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good. - Yeah.

63
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
Bodyguard's gotta be close to people though.

64
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,660
He gotta talk all the time, and I'm no good at that.

65
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,330
You'll be the silent type. People are gonna appreciate that.

66
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,040
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

67
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,020
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

68
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,920
He owns one ofthe plants inJuarez.

69
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,110
Yeah?

70
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,970
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

71
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,900
He's trying to persuade Ford to partnerwith him.

72
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,920
I think he's in trouble. His family lives in Mexico City.

73
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,550
He asked me if l knew anybody he could trust.

74
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,190
- And you thought of me. - Yeah.

75
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,700
Take a job, Crease. Breathe some air.

76
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,070
Then decide if you want to stick around or not.

77
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,380
Besides, I'm glad to see you. I got nobody to talk to down here.

78
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,870
Listen, my wife wants someone presentable and polite.

79
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,500
You'll be the fifth candidate she sees this week.

80
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,370
Your resume's quite impressive.

81
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,940
Sixteen years of military experience, extensive counterterrorism work.

82
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm surprised anybody could afford you. What's the catch?

83
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,910
I drink.

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,310
How does that affect you?

85
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,790
Well

86
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,950
coordination, reaction time.

87
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,950
If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, I'll do the best I can

88
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,970
but the service will be on parwith the pay.

89
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,030
What ifamateurs tried?

90
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,420
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

91
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,390
No.

92
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,270
No one is to know aboutyour drinking. That includes mywife.

93
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,920
Lisa!

94
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,140
Lisa!

95
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,120
My wife, Lisa. And this is John Creasy.

96
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,410
- You're an American. - So are you.

97
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,230
It's all in there.

98
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,210
Would you like a drink?

99
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,090
Yes, uh,Jack and water'd be good.

100
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,160
- Haveyou done much ofthis kindofwork before? - No, ma'am.

101
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,050
But he has a lot of experience in related fields.

102
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,340
- You have a family, Mr. Creasy? - No.

103
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,510
Pita.

104
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,480
Pita.

105
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,990
- Thankyou. - Yes, Mom?

106
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,920
Honey, this is, uh, Mr. Creasy.

107
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,690
In English, honey.

108
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,490
Um, do you wanna show Mr. Creasy to his room?

109
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,560
- This way, Mr. Creasy. - Okay.

110
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,980
Thankyou.

111
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,380
Just like that?

112
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,970
I think it's nice

113
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,370
that he's an American.

114
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,760
I think it's terrific. You sure?

115
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,860
Thankyou.

116
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,520
Thankyou.

117
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,990
I feel better now.

118
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,840
- !Hola, Bruno!- !Buenas tardes!

119
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,330
That's Bruno, the gardener.

120
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,500
And, um, that's Maria, the cook.

121
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,260
- !Hola, Maria! - Hola, Pita.

122
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,580
We fixed the room up two weeks ago. It's nicer than before.

123
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,630
You've got a TV and C.D. player. What kind ofmusic do you like, Mr. Creasy?

124
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,080
I don't know.

125
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,790
- You don't know? - I don't know.

126
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,970
That's Bird.

127
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,930
Emilio forgot to take him when he left.

128
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,480
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

129
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,580
Have you protected a lot of children before, Mr. Creasy?

130
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,500
Creasy. You can call me Creasy. And no, you're the first.

131
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,560
Creasy.

132
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,680
Bye, Creasy.

133
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,410
So long.

134
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,280
Bye, Bird.

135
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,220
Ow.

136
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,390
- School tomorrow, peeps. - Does that mean we can get a dog?

137
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,150
Dad promised me one when I went back to school.

138
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,810
Yeah, we'll see.

139
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,860
If you get a dog, will you give up your bear?

140
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,190
You're getting too old for him.

141
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,780
- How'd you like Mr. Creasy? - Creasy.

142
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,150
He said to call him just Creasy.

143
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,800
- Uh- huh. - That isn't disrespectful, is it?

144
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,140
No, not if he asked you.

145
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,170
Here. There you go.

146
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,600
- He's like a bear too. - Yeah?

147
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,100
A big, sad bear.

148
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,440
- Is he sad? - I think. Or something.

149
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,970
- Good night, honey. - Night.

150
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,840
- Oh, can you get me some floss in the morning? - Floss?

151
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,600
- Yeah, the strawberry kind. - Oh, sure.

152
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,110
Good night, Bear.

153
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,050
Creasy Bear.

154
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,550
What's that one for?

155
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,650
La Virgin de Guadalupe.

156
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Business. For T oyota, for Ford.

157
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,890
If one dies, maybe she can resurrect the other one.

158
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,770
I don't know.

159
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,700
She likes him.

160
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,470
- What are you talking about? - Creasy.

161
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,780
Pita likes him.

162
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,680
Pita loves school.

163
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,980
Pita wouldlove Count Dracula ifhe took herback there, honey.

164
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,250
Okay?

165
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,630
- Hey. Are you okay? - I don't know.

166
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,710
Okay?

167
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,150
I don't know, Lisa.

168
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,620
I 'm trying.

169
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,490
Come on, Bird.

170
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,910
That's right. That's right. Come on.

171
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,230
All right. Home to Emilio.

172
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,180
You're home free, baby.

173
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,570
- Where are you from, Creasy? - The U.S.

174
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,610
- I know, but which state? - No state in particular.

175
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,720
You can drive and talk at the same time.

176
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,280
No, I can't, Pita, so, please, let me just do myjob.

177
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,350
Are you going to stay?

178
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,720
My last bodyguard left.

179
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,530
Somebody gave him more money than we could.

180
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,490
I guess that makes me a bargain then, huh?

181
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,150
Being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

182
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,030
Time will tell.

183
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,800
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days.

184
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,700
- Four a day. - Yeah?

185
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,430
- Twenty- four? - Twenty- four. What do you think about that, Creasy?

186
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,210
- I think thatyou know entirely more than you should. - Well, thankyou.

187
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,000
Hola, Miguel.

188
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,450
- See you later. - You have to sign.

189
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,880
- What? - You have to sign in, show them your I.D.

190
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,360
Buenos dias. Come on.

191
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,330
Right there.

192
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,060
- Hola, Manuel. - Hola, Pita.

193
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,830
- Hola, Pita!- Hola!

194
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,020
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

195
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,120
Sister Anna, this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

196
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,250
Sister Anna, the headmistress.

197
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,400
Senor Creasy.

198
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,410
Hurry. Class is about to begin.

199
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,840
- Go, go. - Bye, Creasy.

200
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,420
- Madre. - You must look after our Pita.

201
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,740
It is not good that she's late today.

202
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,410
I'm very sorry. I, uh I'll have to get used to the rules. It won't happen again.

203
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
No offense, but I regret thatyour profession needs to exist.

204
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,320
So do I, Madre. So do I.

205
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,740
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?

206
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
No, not for a long time.

207
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,570
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome"

208
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,070
"Overcome evil with good."

209
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,050
I'm the sheep that got lost, Madre.

210
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,540
When you were a kid, Creasy, did you like school?

211
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
- I don't remember. - You don't remember?

212
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,310
No, I don't remember. It, uh Nah, I didn't like it.

213
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,430
Why not?

214
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,100
Because it wasn't a school likeyours.

215
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,130
There was no, uh no Sister Anna.

216
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,300
Wereyou unhappy?

217
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,870
Being unhappy, Pita, that's a state of mind. I really don't remember.

218
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,380
What happened to your hand?

219
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,810
- It's a birth defect. - No, it's not.

220
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,520
Look, no more questions, okay?

221
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,780
- It really wasn't a question. - It sounded like a question.

222
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,380
Look, I got a job to do. Hey!

223
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,730
No. Gracias. Gracias. No. No.

224
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,770
Listen to me. I'm being paid to protect you, okay?

225
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,840
No, no, no. I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.

226
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,020
Look at me. I'm not beingpaid to beyourfriend.

227
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,660
I'm beingpaid to protectyou, so no more questions. That's it. Period.

228
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,180
- You hear me? - Yes.

229
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,740
- And no crying. - I 'm not crying.

230
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,950
Well, don't start.

231
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,460
You gotta understand, this is a job.

232
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,450
In order for me to do

233
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,390
In order for Wait a minute.

234
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,090
Yeah, come in.

235
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,790
Mr. Creasy.

236
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,640
I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.

237
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,770
I'm fine, thanks.

238
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,190
Is the food all right? 'Cause, uh, Maria told meyou didn't eat.

239
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,900
Uh yeah, the food is great.

240
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,430
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

241
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,330
Soyou, uh, read the Bible?

242
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,040
Yeah, sometimes.

243
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,800
- Does it help? - Yeah, sometimes.

244
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,840
- Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.

245
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,470
How are you doing with Pita?

246
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,370
Fine. Fine.

247
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,740
Soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, we'll be fine.

248
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,940
- Yeah, she told me about that. - Okay.

249
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,610
- You don't have children, do you? - I told you I didn't.

250
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,440
Well, they can be tenacious when theywant something.

251
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,820
- And Pita just wants to be friends. - Okay.

252
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,450
Butyou're paying me to protect her, right? Not to be her friend.

253
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,880
Right?

254
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,180
So, uh

255
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,920
Iook, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

256
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,820
Maybe your husband should find somebodywho's a little more sociable.

257
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,830
No, you're right.

258
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,330
You're being paid to protect her

259
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,800
and I'm confident thatyou'll do that.

260
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,590
I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I hope that's all right.

261
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,500
You think God will forgive us for what we've done?

262
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,920
I'm tired ofkillin ', Ray.

263
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,440
You think God will forgive us for what we 've done?

264
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,210
In my state, I couldn 't I couldn 't guard a corpse.

265
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,710
Talk all the time.

266
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,710
You know, I'm no good at that.

267
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,090
You know, I'm no good at that.

268
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,540
You know how they say

269
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,020
a bullet always tells the truth?

270
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,160
Yeah.

271
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,360
- Hey. - Crease.

272
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,200
What's wrong?

273
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,640
Hey, listen, you- you ever have a

274
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,170
a nine- millimeter round that didn't go off?

275
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, yeah. Failure to fire.

276
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,340
I know. Failure to fire and- and- and, uh

277
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,580
You know, I pulled the trigger and and and

278
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,620
click, nothing.

279
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
You're talking about a bad primer.

280
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,750
Yeah, I Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

281
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,610
But I You know, right, dimple. Dimple on the primer.

282
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,670
That may be.

283
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,290
Well, like we used to say

284
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,650
a bullet always tells the truth.

285
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,250
Crease?

286
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,290
- You all right? - Yeah.

287
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,880
What wereyou shooting at?

288
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,050
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I wokeyou.

289
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,510
No, i- it's okay. Nothin'. I was watchin' TV.

290
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,390
Okay.

291
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,750
All right.

292
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,250
Pita, you have a pencil?

293
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,470
Thankyou.

294
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,880
It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.

295
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,060
Yeah. I'm very sorry.

296
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,000
- See you, baby. - All right. See you later.

297
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,420
- Hey. Don't forget your towel. - Oh, thankyou.

298
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,340
Bye. Buenas dias.

299
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,270
- You're a strong swimmer. - I neverwin.

300
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,550
Thanks.

301
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,380
- So what do I do? - What do you think you should do?

302
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,450
You're the fastest one in the water, the slowest one off the blocks.

303
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,210
- What do you think that means? What do you gotta do? - Get faster off the blocks.

304
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,320
Get faster offthe blocks.

305
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,800
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks. - Yeah?

306
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,660
- I was gonna enter the 1 50 freestyle. - Yeah,you'll be fine.

307
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,670
You'll be okay.

308
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,710
- I'll still be slow. - You're not slow.

309
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,420
I never finish better than third.

310
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,480
All right. Maybe you are slow then.

311
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,210
Vamos, Bird!

312
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,490
Vamos!

313
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,160
How do you think he got out?

314
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,730
- I let him go. - It's better to be free, right?

315
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,600
It's better for him.

316
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,520
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

317
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,900
Good night.

318
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,750
Good night.

319
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,900
- See you in a couple of days. I love you. - All right. Love you.

320
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,800
Be good. Come on, Lise.

321
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,520
- All right, sweetheart. We'll call you from Detroit. - Okay.

325
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,330
- Okay. Bye, honey! - Bye.

326
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,680
- I love you. - Love you.

327
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,070
I hate leaving her.

328
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,030
Concentratin'?

329
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,260
Eyes are closed?

330
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,020
What happened?

331
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,530
- I flinched. - You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

332
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,550
- Say it. - The gunshot holds no fear.

333
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,140
The gunshot holds no fear! Say it.

334
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,210
- The gunshot holds no fear. - Louder!

335
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,300
- The gunshot holds no fear! - Louder!

336
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,720
- The gunshot holds no fear! - That's good.

337
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,710
You welcome the sound.

338
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,130
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

339
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,340
You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free.

340
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,710
- Areyou ready? Areyou ready? - Yes. Yes.

341
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,320
- Areyou set? - Uh- huh.

342
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,690
- Creasy? - Hmm?

343
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,810
- What's a concubine? - Why do you ask?

344
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,340
It's in my history book.

345
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,160
- Oh. - It's like a wife, right?

346
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,460
Yeah. Yes, uh Can I see that?

347
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,130
- Kind of a wife. - Right there.

348
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,300
But the emperor ofChina had 1,000 ofthem.

349
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,470
Um

350
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,640
Okay, like nowadays in- in the West, they have one husband for one wife.

351
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,350
But in the olden time cultures, they had, uh

352
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,060
you know, different uh, different rules.

353
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,670
- Why, you feel sorry for the husband? - Yeah.

354
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,310
Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?

355
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,810
Creasy. You're smiling.

356
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,410
- What? - You were smiling.

357
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,630
- No, I'm not. No, I was not. - You were.

358
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,140
- You're not now, but you were. - You were smiling. I wasn't.

359
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,120
- You were. - When?

360
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,610
- Like five seconds ago. - I'm not smiling.

361
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,250
A second ago you were. - You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

362
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,440
Six seconds ago I wasn't smiling. - Ten seconds ago.

363
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,260
Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in the next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.

364
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,020
- You smiled already. See? You did. - Mmm!

365
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,940
- No, that wasn't a That was a smirk. - Yeah, you

366
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,180
That's not a smile. A smirk is different.

367
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,050
They both start with "S," but they're not the same Do your homework.

368
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,040
You were.

369
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,090
Bang!

370
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,590
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Come back, come back.

371
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,500
Bang!

372
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,670
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Come here.

373
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,970
Hurry up, hurry up. Set.

374
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,820
Bang!

375
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,340
Bang!

376
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,600
You don't flinch when you hear the gunshot, understand?

377
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,550
You listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.

378
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,150
Concentrate on the sound. You understand me?

379
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,730
They're gaining on you! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Stop! Stop!

380
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,850

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,590
Oh, I missed you so much.

383
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,250
- I missed you too. - How are you doing? I got a surprise for you.

384
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,700
- You do? - Ready?

385
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,300
- Huh? - You got me a dog! You finally got me a dog!

386
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,140
- What do you think? - Oh, my gosh.

387
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,200
- Just what I wanted. What's his name? - Sam, like Dad.

Any more questions?

394
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,570
- Do you have a girlfriend? - What?

395
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,580
- Do you have a girlfriend? - No.

396
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,860
What kind ofquestion is that? You're supposed to be studying history.

397
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,420
- That is history. Creasy history. - No, that's ancient history.

398
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,180
- No more questions. - Who was your very first girlfriend?

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,300
- Good night. - Goodnight, honey.

- I'm tough, Creasy. - No such thing as tough.

413
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,910
There's trained, then there's untrained.

414
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,600
- Now, which are you? - Trained.

415
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,190
Trained. Okay. Let's go again.

Okay. Hey.

418
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm a prisoner in the block until the gunshot sets me free.

419
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,330
- Don't smile, don't fool around if you want to win. - Okay.

420
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,420
- You want to win? Trained or untrained? - Trained.

423
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,510
Pita's parents are away on business in Juarez. I was

424
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,400

425
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,100
Pita Ramos!

426

- Okay. - I won!

428
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,500
- Once upon a time, when we were young - When I was young.

429
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,560
Well, when we were young and he was younger

430
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,320
all heads turned ourway.

431
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,220
We made a deal to take the world together.

432
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,270
Yeah, then one day I got a call, and he said

433
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,570
I'm in love! I'm in love!

434
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,620
And I'm moving to Mexico. "

435
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,190
AndI said

436
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,830
What happened to the plan? What happened to it?

437
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,920
I said, "The plan's right here."

438
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,530
Yeah. Yeah. And what'd I do?

439
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,070
I hung up, then I met Alicia

440
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,320
and then I went, "Oh, now I gotyou! I gotyou."

441
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,070
I got it. Can I kiss her? Is that

442
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,810
Absolutely! Hey, what are you doing?

443
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,350
- You got me. - Okay, I think now is a good a time as any.

444
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,760
I bought it with my own money.

445
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,360
Open it.

446
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,340
It's St.Jude, patron saint oflost causes.

447
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,290
Wow.

448
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,150
Well deserved.

449
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,070
Thankyou, Pita. It's beautiful.

450
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,510
You're welcome.

451
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,010
- Dad. - Yes, sweetie?

452
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,960
Can I talk to you?

453
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,280
Yes.

454
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,520
I don't want to play piano. I want to swim.

455
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,240
It's not open for discussion, honey, okay?

456
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,110
Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher, and ifhe accepts you as his student

457
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,210
you're gonna play the piano.

458
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,150
Whatever.

459
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,720
Baby.

460
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,340
- I love you. - I love you.

461
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,740
- I just want what's best for you, you know that? - Okay.

462
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,810
Okay, honey.

463
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,910
if you broke all my fingers, then taped them back together

464
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,080
I wouldn't be able to play piano, but I could still swim.

465
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,530
Sam, get back.

466
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,560
Don't be a crybaby. You're tougher than that.

467
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,130
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

468
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,170
- Remember the dayyou wanted the pencil? - Yeah.

469
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,640
I know why.

470
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,380
- Yeah? - You wanted the license number off ofthat car.

471
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,010
I wrote it down in my notebook.

472
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,970
I got it all but the last number.

473
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,030
I'll get it from you lat Can you belch?

474
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,280
Burp. Can you burp?

475
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,030
That's good. That's very good.

476
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,320
- I just had a Coke. - All right. Listen.

477
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,620
Now, this teacher, this famous teacher

478
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,910
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays for the symphonies, right?

479
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,500
- Right. - You belch every few minutes while you're practicing.

480
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,920
- Okay. - You apologize to him, butyou keep belching.

481
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,750
- You'll offend every sensibility he has. - Okay.

482
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,480
Very good. You'll be back in the pool in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

483
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,840
Right, Sam?

Speak slower, please. My Russian is better than my English.

517
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,630
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we neither need norwant police assistance.

518

We're gonna We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

519

SenorRamos, two police officers were killed

520
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,290
duringyour daughter's abduction.

521
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,480
I have a written order from Ministerio Publico

522
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,440
authorizing our participation ex- officio.

523
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,470
if you want to speak to Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

524
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,630
No. Okay.

525
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,760
The kidnapperwill tell you to deliver the money alone.

526
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,510
Porfavor, don't do that

527
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,710
oryou will find yourself in a real Mexican hell.

528
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,340
No mariachi. No tequila and no Pita.

529
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,840
Crease.

530
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,500
Crease.

531
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,900
When I heardit was this hospital, I was so pleased.

532
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:31,160
There is a pastry shop nearby.

533
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,850
Delgado's. They have the best pastries in Mexico.

534
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:38,320
Oh, Miguel Manzano

535
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,950
director of the A.F.I .

536
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,580
and a former director oflnterpol in Rome.

537
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:51,270
- And you are? - Friend ofhis. Rayburn.

538
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,250
Rayburn?

539
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,730
Hola.

540
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,330
Do you love your daughter, Senor Ramos?

541
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,520
Yes. Yes.

542
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,720
- Do you want to see her again? - Yes, I do.

543
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,680
Senor, if your daughter's life

544
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,230
is as important to you as it is to me

545
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,650
you will do as I say.

546
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,410
- Yes? - Okay. Yes.

547
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,100
- Crease. Can you hear me? - Hmm.

548
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,860
You got four of them. All dead.

549
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,680
- Pita. - It's, uh

550
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,380
It's been two days. They're negotiating a ransom.

551
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,230
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

552
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,490
Crease.

553
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,630
Don't fuck with me, all right?

554
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,820
Do you have the 10 million? Do you have the money?

555
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,430
- Yes, we have the money. - Now if you do as I say

556
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,620
the girl will be returned exactly as she was taken.

557
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,270
But if you deviate from the process in any way

558
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,620
I swear, you will never see her again.

559
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,910
I understand. Listen, I- I too worship la Virgin de Guadalupe.

560
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,740
I ask you if you understand.

561
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,580
Hello, sir. This is, uh, Mr. Ramos's attorney.

562
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:49,100
He's going through a very difficult time here, but he understands.

563
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,740
Do you understand? Repeat the drop instructions.

564
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,180
Okay, the money, 10 million, U.S., will be divided into

565
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,490
two 1 5- gallon black canvas bags, each containing five million

566
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,170
which will be checked at the bank by the K. R. agent

567
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:06,630
then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

568
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,160
You got a flat tire here.

569
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,680
This is for you.

570
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,840
Hel lo. Yeah.

571
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,680
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

572
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,910
No. Why?

573
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,820
He's got a bad ticker. He's got a heart condition.

574
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,270
Look, he's a nervous kid who doesn't respond well to stress.

575
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:34,890
All right. But the carwill not be powerful.

576
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,120
Remove the trunk lid. Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

577
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,560
You willarrive at La Diana Fountain at 1:00 a.m.

578
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:49,660
You will drive around the circle two times.

579
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:54,050
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window

580
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,950
to I. D. the car.

581
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,200
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

582
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,800
The phone will ring. He will answer and wait for instructions.

583
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,780
There is a map on the top ofthe phone. Follow it.

584
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,650
Perfecto.

585
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,940
- What are you doi ng? He said no phones! - Relax. Relax.

586
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,870
- I 'm just trying to protect your daughter.- J ust get me there, please.

587
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,220
- What's going on? - Hospitals can be very dangerous places.

588
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,130
Especiallywhen you have killed two corrupt cops.

589
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,290
Leave the money in the trunk ofthe white car.

590
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,010
Then return to your car.

591
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,310
Do not look back.

592
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,780
Remember, I'm a professional.

593
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,910
if you keep your word, I will keep mine.

594
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,250
- Hel lo. - Mr. Ramos.

595
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,770
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

596
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,930
You took my money.

597
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,490
Senor Ramos

598
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:03,890
All right. Get out of here, all ofyou. Get the fuck out of my house!

599
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:08,910
Okay, this is Lisa.

600
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,730
I'm Pita's mother.

601
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:16,370
And I'm very sorry forwhatever happened to your nephew, but I beg you

602
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:24,080
This conversation is not being recorded.

603
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:31,610
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I wish we had talked sooner, senora.

604
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,020
I'm really sorry.

605
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,160
Now it is too late.

606
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:52,320
Fuck off!. Get the fuck out of my fucking house now!

607
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,230
Get out! Get out!

608
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,580
Hey.

609
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,280
Hey.

610
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,180
Hey, Ray.

611
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:53,590
- Where am I? - Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

612
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,830
Manzano was afraid the cops were gonna kill you.

613
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:05,430
How ya doin', Doc?

614
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,300
What's the matter?

615
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,270
She's de dead, Crease.

616
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,550
It's a mess.

617
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,020
Somebody hijacked the drop, and, uh

618
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,830
the kidnapper's nephew was killed

619
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,460
so he k he killed Pita.

620
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,800
No.

621
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,090
No.

622
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,990
Did you recognize any of these men?

623
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,690
No. Does that make me a suspect?

624
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,270
No.

625
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,300
It would be convenient, but no.

626
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,520
Um, maybeyou should show me some pictures of some Mexican cops.

627
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,570
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then. - Those were all policemen.

628
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,690
Bad judicial cops.

629
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,010
Protected by a brotherhood.

630
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,940
Brotherhood?

631
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:59,030
A brotherhood called La Hermandad.

632
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,730
You all set?

633
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,820
- Hmm? - Right arm. Here.

634
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,270
- Okay? - Yeah. I'm all right.

635
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,300
Let's go.

636
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:06,880
- Somebody's on us. - Yeah. Lois Lane.

637
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:10,850
- Who? - Mariana something, works for Reforma.

638
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,180
Newspaperjournalist.

639
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,910
Maybe she thinks you're a scoop.

640
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,980
I 'll get you up to the border.

641
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,580
A friend of mine will take you to San Diego, drop you right at the naval hospital.

642
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:30,080
- I'm not going, Ray. - What are you gonna do?

643
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,230
Let's take a ride by the crime scene. She can follow us.

644
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,050
Buenos dias.

645
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,800
Mr. Creasy?

646
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,700
A lot of people are looking for you.

647
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,350
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

648
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,040
Reporter for Reforma.

649
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,700
- Nice to meet you. - I found this across the street.

650
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,910
Open it.

651
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:15,320
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

652
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,160
- They've put a curse onyou. - Ha. They're a little late.

653
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:31,320
- What are you going to do? - I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

654
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,850
I can help you.

655
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:42,840
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

656
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,990
It protects high- ranking government officials, corrupt police

657
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:49,480
and organized crime at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.

658
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,050
Okay.

659
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,970
And I think thatyou and Lupita Ramos are victims ofthis organization.

660
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:02,790
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give meyour story, then I can helpyou.

661
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:05,450
Please.

662
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,650
Help me do what?

663
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,510
You're gonna help me do what?

664
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,740
You're a stranger here, no?

665
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:21,090
That's right.

666
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,390
You're going to need friends that know theirway around.

667
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,070
Okay.

668
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,970
Okay, friend that's gonna help me.

669
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:36,740
A pleasure to meetyou. Tell your driver to keep his distance next time.

670
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,010
All right, friend?

671
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,330
Si.

672
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,670
You'll be stateside by supper time.

673
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:05,650
I'm gonna need some help first though, Ray.

674
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,690
if you don'tstop bleeding, you won't last a daythe shapeyou're in.

675
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:12,130
- Is that a yes or is that a no? - Yeah.

676
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,040
But I'm done killing. I told you that.

677
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,010
- Okay. - Anything else is yours.

678
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:26,980
- You're talking about war. - Exactlywhat I'm talking about.

679
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,910
Can you help me?

680
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,710
- Yeah. - Good.

681
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:49,640
Creasy.

682
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,810
- What are you doing here? - Oh.

683
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,810
Came to get my stuff.

684
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:59,210
Couldn't find my Bible. I thought it might be in here.

685
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,860
- I borrowed it. - Okay.

686
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,900
It's crazy, huh?

687
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,570
One weekwe're figuring out which nightclub to go to

688
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:13,880
and the next thing I'm reading the Bible.

689
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:17,720
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

690
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,110
I keep thinking, if onlywe hadn't

691
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,720
It's like, um

692
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,500
mywhole life, all I've everthought about

693
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,590
was what I could get for myself.

694
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:44,290
Even with my own baby.

695
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,380
She needed me so much, and sometimes

696
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:54,250
I felt like I had nothing to give her.

697
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,080
Just, um, I don't know what to do.

698
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,890
- What are you gonna do? - What I do best.

699
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,010
I'm gonna kill 'em.

700
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,100
Anyone who was involved. Anybodywho profited from it.

701
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,730
Anybodywho opens their eyes at me.

702
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,880
You kill 'em all.

703
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,250
Yla Browning.

704
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,990
Hola.

705
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,160
Yeah, it's me.

706
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:35,320
- Mr. Creasy. - Okay. I need the license

707
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,410
Well, no, excuse me.

708
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,390
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C- 5- T- K- 8.

709
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,900
That's C- 5- T- K- 8.

710
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,130
I got everything but the last digit, so I need 10 possible matches.

711
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,460
And when do I find out which ofthe 10 it is?

712
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:55,320
- Eventually. - Well, where do I reach you?

713
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:59,270
I'll call you.

714
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:19,880
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon. Yes, I know all ofthat.

715
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,300
He's an assassin. And you want to help him identify the owner ofa car for him?

716
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:38,630
- Mariana. - Si.

717
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,520
Gracias.

718
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,130
Ciao.

719
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,390
Now,Jorge Gonzales.

720
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,850
Okay.

721
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,970
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

722
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,940
What I do best.

723
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,240
Anyone who was involved. Anybody who profited from it.

724
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,870
Anybody who opens their eyes at me, I'm gonna kill 'em.

725
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,350
Oh, God!

726
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

727
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,010
Okay? Ahora.

728
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,340
Huh? You know who I am?

729
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,000
Correct?

730
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,180
Correct.

731
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,300
Okay.

732
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,600
Hey, hey, hey.

733
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,280
No se nada.

734
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,170
Hmm?

735
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,620
La Voice.

736
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,610
Okay.

737
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,910
Okay.

738
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,240
Okay. Well.

739
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,470
Wait, wait, wait.

740
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:20,880
Give me one cigarette, please.

741
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,390
- Si. - Okay.

742
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:37,640
Okay, my friend. It's off to the next life for you.

743
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,790
I guarantee you, you won't be lonely.

744
01:26:07,050 --> 01:26:10,540
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

745
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,770
- La nina. - No.

746
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,000
No? Vamos.

747
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,200
No?

748
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,140
Hmm?

749
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,120
I heard you speaking Spanish. You're American, right?

750
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,100
- And so are you. - Yeah.

751
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,660
- Get out of here. Where are you from? - I'm from NewJersey.

752
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,140
- You from New Jersey? - Yeah.

753
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:26,890
I'm from New Jersey. All right, listen to me.

754
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:32,490
All right. Everything is done up by cellphone.

755
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:35,850
You just wait around for calls, and we don't even have a fucking number.

756
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,950
Who pays you?

757
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:43,440
We got an A.T.M. card. We take out 200 fucking measly dollars every two weeks.

758
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,880
- Two hundred dollars? - Yeah.

759
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,180
- What's the PI N number? - The what?

760
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,470
The PI N number. Code number.

761
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,060
- 4747 - 4747

762
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:57,460
- Yeah. - Good. You wouldn't lie to me, right?

763
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,040
- I'm not lying, man. - Did you kill her? You didn't kill her, did you?

764
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,190
No.

765
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,990
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?

766
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,720
Oh, man, you're making me fucking nervous.

767
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,860
- Did you kill her? - Noway. The fucking boss did, or his brother.

768
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,160
- We never see his face. - You're not lying to me, are you?

769
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,480
No. Goddamn it! I'm telling you the truth!

770
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,110
Tell me, who? You never see whose face?

771
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,550
Well, we were in the otherroom

773
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:30,410
and the money got stolen.

774
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:32,410
Wait, wait. Wh- What? Somebody stole what money?

775
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,310
- The ransom money at the drop. - Who? Who stole it?

776
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,800
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it. - Who?

777
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,060
- Fuentes. - Fuentes?

778
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,250
Yeah, that's right.

Yeah. Now.

781
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,910
- This Fuentes guy? - Yeah.

782
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,430
He's a lieutenant for the Anti- Kidnapping Division.

783
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,970
Fuentes is. What'd you do?

784
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,680
- Oh, man. - Tell me about the girl. What'd you do?

785
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,350
- Huh? What'dyou do? - I just do what they told me.

786
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,960
- You do what they tell you to do? - Yeah.

787
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,430
Did you say good- bye to her? Answer my question.

788
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,850
- Did you say good- bye to her? - No!

789
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,480
- You didn't? Here's your chance. Say good- bye. - Oh, shit!

790
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,450
Say good- bye to her. Say good- bye to her.

791
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,600
Fucking let me go!

792
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,340
Rico?

793
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,250
Okay. Okay.

794
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,900
- No? - No.

795
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,640
Si.

796
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,910
Si.

797
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,670
- Si, Guerrero. - Listen, it's me.

798
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:29,050
Yeah, it's me. You know anything about a young girl being kidnapped recently?

799
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:32,210
- She's about 1 2 years old? - Yes, that's last night.

800
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,050
- Do you know something? - What's her name?

801
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:36,040
Uh, Camilla. Camilla Valencias.

802
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:39,350
?Camilla? ?Se llama Camilla?

803
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,340
- Si. - Okay. I got her.

804
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,070
Where are you?

805
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,640
- Creasy, what happened? - It's okay.

806
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:18,810
Sit down. Relax.

807
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:21,680
She's okay. She's okay. You got banking connections?

808
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:25,250
Yes, I have connections.

809
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:30,090
Okay. The PI N number's 47 47.

810
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:33,850
I wanna find out who's putting money in that account.

811
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,830
What do you know about a cop named Fuentes?

812
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:42,220
He's with the Anti- Kidnapping Division.

813
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:44,890
He's the one who drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

814
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,580
- Fuentes? - Si.

815
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:50,990
- Who is she? - You can ask herlater. She'll tellyou anything.

816
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,590
What do you know about him? About Fuentes?

817
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,400
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000 and a dead body in the trunk ofhis car.

818
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,000
- Huh. - Never charged.

819
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,870
Arresting officer couldn't testify 'cause he was dead.

820
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,760
- Is he La Hermandad? - Mm- hmm.

821
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,250
- You know where he lives? - He lives in a judicial compound.

822
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:14,250
He travels by motorcade.

823
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,890
Creasy, he's betterprotected than the president ofMexico.

824
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,340
He's gonna need it. You gonna take care of her?

825
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:25,100
- Yes. Well, how can I find you? - I'll find you.

826
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:56,630
This is my jurisdiction.

827
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:01,150
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

828
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:06,210
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than 10 years ofyour courts and tribunals.

829
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:09,790
- Just stay out ofhis way. - I plan to.

830
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:20,720
I will even help him, if l can.

831
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,880
But, uh, I would like to understand him.

832
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:28,390
Give me that.

833
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,110
Pita Ramos

834
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:34,680
that's a numberto you.

835
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:39,620
You know, one more dead, but a number.

836
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:42,440
What was she to Creasy then?

837
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,270
She showed him it was all right to live again.

838
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:52,470
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

839
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,540
And they're gonna wish they never touched a hair on her head.

840
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:01,320
A man can be an artist

841
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,840
in anything food, whatever.

842
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:11,860
It depends on how good he is at it.

843
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,920
Creasy's art is death.

844
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:23,830
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

845
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,620
I don't have anything else to say.

846
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:25,480
Forgiveness is between them and God.

847
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,510
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

848
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:27,920
Don't move. Put your hands down. Put 'em down.

849
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:38,910
SenorJohn W. Creasy

850
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:42,560

851
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,830
He's suspected ofpossible involvement

852
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:51,270
ofpossible involvement in the kidnapping ofLupita Ramos.

853
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,160
Can you hear me? H uh?

854
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:27,840
Know where we are?

855
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:33,430
We're under the bridge where the deal went bad.

856
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:38,190
The ransom got stolen. You wanna tell me what happened?

857
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:41,080
- Haveyou heard of La Hermandad? - Yes, I have.

858
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,140
- Do you know what it is? - Yes.

859
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,140
- You're the president? - Yes.

860
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:49,230
The president? Wow.

861
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:51,370
Look at me.

862
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,040
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry.

863
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:57,670
How's that?

864
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:07,760
Let me show you what I got here.

865
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:13,190
See this? This is a charger. It's used by convicts to hide money and drugs.

866
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:17,150
They stick it in their body. They tuck it up their rectum.

867
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:20,590
You familiarwith that? This Look at me.

868
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:23,310
Pencil detonator.

869
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:27,040
Timer, used as a receiver- transmitter.

870
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:30,140
C- 4. Highly explosive.

871
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:32,600
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

872
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,160
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

873
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:40,360
That's whatyou have in your ass right now.

874
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:43,730
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

875
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:50,410
Cheap watch. Pagerwatch.

876
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:55,990
Used to send a page to the receiver that's upyour behind right now.

877
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:59,120
So, I'm gonna send you a page

878
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:01,220
which you will receive

879
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,680
in five minutes.

880
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,300
Now.

881
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:19,220
You got less than five minutes to tell me what went down between your men and the kidnapper.

882
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,510
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

883
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:24,180
- Four minutes and 30 seconds. - Nothing. I don't know him.

884
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:27,880
You don't know? Fourminutes and 25 seconds.

885
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:32,850
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?

886
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,760
Okay.

887
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:40,980
I got all the time in the world. You don't, but I do.

888
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:43,750
- Hey, relax, relax, buddy. - I'm relaxed.

889
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:46,740
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

890
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:50,510
I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.

891
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:51,700
And?

892
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:54,890
And I had my men ready as we got instructions where to go.

893
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,930
You had your men ready to steal the drop.

894
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,410
You had your men readyto kill one of the kidnappers,yeah?

895
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:01,140
You've done this manytimes.

896
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:07,300
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper - Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

897
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:10,600
- Bingo, yeah. You've done this many times, huh? - Many times, yeah.

898
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,930
- Yeah. Killed many victims too, haven't you? - Come on, sir.

899
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:16,980
- We just make out as best we can. - "As best we could"?

900
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:23,370
2:47
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

901
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:28,130
Wait- Wait a minute. Come on.

902
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,370
- I have a little gift for you. - Forme?

903
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:33,160
- Yeah. Come on. Come on. - What do you got?

904
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:37,470
There was no $10 million. There was one halfin the bags.

905
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:40,320
The ransom was $10 million? They put it in two bags.

906
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:42,590
- Five million in each bag, right? - Two bags, true.

907
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:46,090
But one has halfpaper

908
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:49,430
the other onlypaper.

909
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:53,340
Maybe your men stole it.

910
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,010
Whoever did it took it before the exchange.

911
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:01,080
Okay. At the Ramos house

912
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:05,740
before the exchange, who put the bags in the car?

913
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:08,050
- Guess what. - What?

914
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:11,590
Ramos lawyer,Jordan Kalfus.

915
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:14,260
- Jordan Kalfus? - Yeah.

916
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,600
Pedro.

917
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,880
Sir? Please.

918
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:31,980
I- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for the girl.

919
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:35,900
It was just business. You know, I'm a professional.

920
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,200
That's what everybody keeps saying. "I'm just a professional."

921
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:42,450
Everybody keeps saying that to me. "I'm just a professional. I'm just a professional."

922
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:45,680
I'm getting sick and tired ofhearing that. You understand me?

923
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,800
What are you going to do now?

924
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,920
What am I gonna do? I'm gonna leave. I gotta go.

925
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,080
- Yeah. I got - Come on. Come on. What about me, huh?

926
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:00,400
- What about you? You got 40 seconds. - Come on.

927
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:04,880
- Thirty- five. - A last wish, please. Please.

928
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,050
Last wish? I wish you had more time.

929
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:14,140
Hey! Hey, hey!

930
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:20,350
Hola.

931
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:23,310
- Mariana, it's me. - Creasy, where are you?

932
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:27,850
Listen, I got something that looks like banking codes from BankCoast in the Cayman Islands.

933
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:31,200
- I need it translated as fast as you can. - Whose account is it?

934
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:35,630
Jordan Kalfus, andit looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals.

935
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:37,840
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

936
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,250
Samuel Ramos. That's it?

937
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,980
- That's it. - Okay.

938
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,220
Gracias.

939
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:32,300
- Creasy. - Samuel.

940
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,290
Honey?

941
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:40,790
What's going on?

942
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:46,390
That's what I wanna know. What is going on?

943
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:51,470
Huh, Sam?

944
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:53,800
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple of questions, okay?

945
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,090
You move

946
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,160
you make one sound

947
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,550
I'll snatch the life right outta you, you understand?

948
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,460
What happened, Lisa, hmm?

949
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,290
Were you in on this?

950
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:18,460
- Orwas it justyour husband, huh? - Am I in on what?

951
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:22,070
You know what I'm talking about Pita's kidnapping, her death. Wereyou a part ofit?

952
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:25,480
- Pita got killed because the ransom got stolen. - Shut up!

953
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:29,550
Yeah, the moneywas stolen. You're right. He's right.

954
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:33,140
The moneywas stolen byVictor Fuentes. How much was stolen though, huh?

955
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:36,140
- $2.5 million, right? - What are you talking about?

956
01:52:36,230 --> 01:52:39,360
He knows what I'm talking about. $2.5 million. That's whatVictor got, isn't it?

957
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:42,480
- What are you talking about? - 2.5 million.

958
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,870
2.5 million to yourlawyer Jordan Kalfus

959
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:48,080
that he put in an account in the Cayman Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

960
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,880
What happened to the other five, Sam?

961
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:56,820
Huh? That's 2.5, 2.5. What is five from 10?

962
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:59,390
That's five. What happened to the other five, Sam? Tell yourwife.

963
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:01,990
It's your chance to talk. What happened to the otherfive?

964
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:03,460
- You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't have a wife.

965
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:06,320
Then you'll never know how hard it could be to tell your wife the truth.

966
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:08,660
No, you have a wife! You tell me what happened!

967
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,890
It was in this room that my father prayed.

968
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:13,710
- I don't give a fuck about your fucking father! - My father prayed.

969
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:17,720
He prayed that his gambling debts and his infidelities would be forgiven right in this room.

970
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:20,520
- Sam uel! I love you! - What, Lisa?

971
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:24,710
- Tell me the truth. - I didn't i nherit a ki ngdom! That's the truth!

972
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:27,530
You wanna know the truth? I inherited his debt and his mess.

973
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:30,430
- I inherited his lawyerJordan - You tell me what happened to my baby!

974
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,180
Say it! Say it! Say it!

975
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,830
Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!

976
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:42,180
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room

977
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,580
and watch cartoons all day

978
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:47,550
and she'd eat ice cream and we'd have her back in two days.

979
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,230
He lied to me!

980
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:53,220
That's why he's fucking dead! I did it!

981
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,470
I did it, Lisa!

982
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:58,310
I agreed to the kidnapping.

983
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:01,750
I did it for us for the three of us.

984
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,370
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

985
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,470
You kill him.

986
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,900
You kill him or I will.

987
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,300
Huh. You know, they say a, um

988
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,930
a bullet always tells the truth.

989
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:12,990
It never lies.

990
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:30,300
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe

991
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:35,070
maybe it'll work for you.

992
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,930
I'll prayfor you.

993
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,500

Yeah, Reina, she's what, about eight months?

Huh? You wanna negotiate?

The most important thing in life is family.

And in exchange, I will get my life back.

- Pita's dead. - Creasy!

1042
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:28,900
I'm a businessman. A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.

1043
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:35,120
All right.

You pull the trigger, all right?

You understand?
