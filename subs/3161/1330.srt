1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000


2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000


3
00:00:53,716 --> 00:01:00,262


4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:15,210


5
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,664


6
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,664
I'm dying of thirst over here. C'mon, come on!

7
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:57,832
Here you are.

8
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,638
- Watch it!  - Sorry, darling.

9
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:07,941
- Here you are.  - Ah, thank you.

10
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,447
Mind if I join you?

11
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:49,847
I'll have the same.

12
00:02:56,205 --> 00:03:01,805
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf, Gandalf the Grey.

13
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,605
I know who you are.

14
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:08,005
Well, now! This is a fine chance.

15
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,605
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

16
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:21,705
I received word, that my father has been seen wandering the wilds near Dunland.

17
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:26,805
I went looking, found no sign of him.

18
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:32,605
Thorin, It has been a long time since anything but rumour was heard of Thrain.

19
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:36,605
He still lives, I am sure of it.

20
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:43,955
My father came to see you before he went missing.

21
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,505
What did you say to him?

22
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,605
I urged him to march upon Erebor.

23
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,305
To run the seven armies of the dwarves.

24
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:55,505
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.

25
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,552
And I would say the same to you,

26
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:00,859
take back your homeland.

27
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,605
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

28
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:12,400
No. It is not.

29
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,953
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough.

30
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:23,037
Sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

31
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:27,944
I ran into some unsavory characters, whilst travelling along the Greenway.

32
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,754
They mistook me for a vagabond.

33
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,520
I imagine they regretted that.

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,604
One of them was carrying a message.

35
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,521
It is Black Speech.

36
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,719
A promise of payment.

37
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,794
For what?

38
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,798
Your head.

39
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,705
Someone wants you dead.

40
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:59,505
Thorin, you could wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin.

41
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:03,976
Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together, you have the might and power...

42
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,736
to retake Erebor.

43
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,854
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families. 

44
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,754
Demand they stand by their oaths.

45
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:14,827
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's jewel...

46
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,027
the Arkenstone.

47
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,525
It is the only thing that would unite them.

48
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:22,244
And in case you've forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

49
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:29,705
What if, I were to help you reclaim it?

50
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,160
How?

51
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,547
The Arkenstone lies half a world away.

52
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:38,005
Buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.

53
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:43,805
Yes, it does. Which is why we are going to need a burglar.

54
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,631


55
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:39,005


56
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,405
- How close is the pack?  - Too close.

57
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,424
A couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.

58
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,424


59
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,902
- Have the Orcs picked up our scent?  - Not yet, but they will do.

60
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,002
We have another problem.

61
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,095
Did they see you? They saw you?

62
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,295
No, that's not it.

63
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,149
Good, what did I tell you? Quite as a mouse.

64
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,860
- Excellent burglar material!  - Will you listen.

65
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,013
Will you just listen?

66
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:07,085
I'm trying to tell you, there is something else out there.

67
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:12,415
What form did it take... Like a bear?

68
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:16,799
Ye... yes, yes. But, bigger, much bigger!

69
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,805
You knew about this beast?

70
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:24,205
- I say we double back.  - And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

71
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,627
There is a house.

72
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:32,462
It's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

73
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,487
Whose house, a friend or a foe?

74
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,763
Neither 'en.

75
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:42,805
He will help us... or he will kill us.

76
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,605
What choice do we have?

77
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,905
None.

78
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:57,905
Run!

79
00:07:58,455 --> 00:07:59,905
<b><i>Abgurid!</i></b>

80
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,805
This way, quickly!

81
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,138
Run!

82
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:20,805
In the house.

83
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,705
Run!

84
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,605
Come on, get inside!

85
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,212
Open the door!

86
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:49,412
Quickly!

87
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,805
Push!

88
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,805
Come on, lads!

89
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,205
What is that?

90
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:15,805
That is our host.

91
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:22,805
His name is Beorn.

92
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,705
And he is a skin-changer.

93
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,572
Sometimes, he is a huge black bear.

94
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,837
Sometimes, he is a great strong man.

95
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:37,022
The bear is unpredictable. But the man can be reasoned with.

96
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:41,291
However, he's not over fond of Dwarves.

97
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,076
He is leaving.

98
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,676
Come away from there!

99
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,988
It's not natural. None of it.

100
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,605
It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

101
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,005
Don't be a fool.

102
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,438
He is under no enchantment but his own.

103
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,638
Alright, now!

104
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,275
Get some sleep, all of you.

105
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,744
You will be safe here, tonight.

106
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,605
I hope.

107
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,455


108

129
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:54,605
So, you are the one they call Oakenshield?

130
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:56,544
Tell me,

131
00:14:56,744 --> 00:15:00,849
why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

132
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,228
You know of Azog, how?

133
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:07,648
My people were the first to live in the mountains,

134
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,605
before the Orcs came down from the north.

135
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,705
The Defiler killed most of my family.

136
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,912
But some he enslaved.

137
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:22,693
Not for work, you understand? But for sport.

138
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:28,805
Caging skin changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

139
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,705
There are others like you?

140
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,905
Once there were many.

141
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,705
And now?

142
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,805
Now, there's only one.

143
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:47,605
You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.

144
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:50,662
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

145
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,852
You are running out of time.

146
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,448
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

147
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:58,276
A darkness lies upon that forest.

148
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:01,705
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

149
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:07,705
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

150
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:12,205
I will not venture there, except in great need.

151
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,316
We will take the Elven road. Their path is still safe.

152
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:17,646
Safe?

153
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,096
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin.

154
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,506
They are less wise and more dangerous.

155
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:27,705
But it matters not.

156
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,605
What do you mean?

157
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,922
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

158
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,070
Their numbers are growing.

159
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,605
And you are on foot. You will never reach the forest alive.

160
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,705
I don't like Dwarves.

161
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,415
They are greedy...

162
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,847
and blind.

163
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,647
Blind to the lives of those they deem less than their own.

164
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:09,205
But Orcs, I hate more.

165
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,805
What do you need?

166
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,605
Go now, while you have the light.

167
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,605
Your hunters are not far behind.

168
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,805
The Elven Gate.

169
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,805
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

170
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,929
No sign of the Orcs.

171
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,185
We have luck on our side.

172
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:09,605
Set the ponies loose, let them return to their master.

173
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:16,189
This forest... feels sick.

174
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,218
As if a disease lies upon it.

175
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,905
Is there no way around?

176
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:27,605
Not unless we go 200 miles north or twice that distance...

177
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,805
south.

178
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,705
Something moves in the shadows, unseen.

179
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,505
Hidden from outside.

180
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,805
Everyday it grows in strength.

181
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,605
Beware the Necromancer.

182
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,605
He's not what he seems.

183
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,605
If our enemy has returned, we must know.

184
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,605
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

185
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,605
The High Fells.

186
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,805
So be it.

187
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:40,605
Not my horse, I need it.

188
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,620
You're not leaving us?

189
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,320
I would not do this unless I had to.

190
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,805
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.

191
00:19:56,705 --> 00:20:00,205
You're not the same hobbit as the one left the Shire.

192
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,805
I was going to tell you...

193
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:13,855
I found something in the goblin tunnels.

194
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,105
Found what?

195
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:21,705
What did you find?

196
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,805
My courage.

197
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:32,805
Good. That's good.

198
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,374
You will need it.

199
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:40,946
I will be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor.

200
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,703
Heed the map and keep it safe!

201
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,805
Do not enter that mountain without me.

202
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,739
This is not the Greenwood alone.

203
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,557
The very air of the forest is heavy, with illusion.

204
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,308
It will seek to enter your mind...

205
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,068
- and lead you astray.  - Lead us astray?

206
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:06,004
What does that mean?

207
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:08,233
You must stay on the path!

208
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,480
Do not leave it. If you do...

209
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,688
you'll never find it again.

210
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,849
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

211
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,931
Come on! We must reach the mountain, before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

212
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,177
It's our one chance to find the hidden door.

213
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,454
The path turns this way.

214
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:04,949
This way.

215
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:15,110
Air...

216
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,210
I need air.

217
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,290
My head... It's spinning!

218
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,490
- What's happening?  - Keep moving.

219
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,180
Nori, why have we stopped?

220
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,590
The path, it's disappeared!

221
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,843
- What's going on?  - We've lost the path!

222
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:34,477
Find it!

223
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:37,449
All of you, look. Look for the path!

224
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:49,338
I don't remember, this place is a mess.

225
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:51,052
None of it is familiar.

226
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,186
It's got to be here.

227
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,497
What hour is it?

228
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:58,612
I don't know, I don't even know what day it is.

229
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:03,283
Is there no end to this accursed place!

230
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:48,553
Look, a tobacco pouch.

231
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,801
There's dwarves in these woods!

232
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,982
Dwarves from the Blue Mountain, no less.

233
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,473
- This is exactly the same as mine!  - Because it is yours.

234
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,059
Do you understand? We're going around in circles, we are lost.

235
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,052
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

236
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,987
But which way is the east? We've lost the sun!

237
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:10,413
The sun.

238
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:14,433
We have to find... the sun.

239
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:16,568
Up there.

240
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:17,868
We need to...

241
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,888
Enough! Quiet! All of you.

242
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,472
We are being watched.

243
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:23,185
I can... see a lake!

244
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,361
And the... river.

245
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,649
And the Lonely Mountain.

246
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,145
We are almost there!

247
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:35,524
Can you hear me?

248
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,764
I know which way to go!

249
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:43,212
Hello?!

250
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:54,418
Hello.

251
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,493
<i>Kill them. Kill them! Eat them now while all their blood is running.</i>

252
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,193
<i>Their hide is tough.</i>

253
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,041
<i>This could be smushy inside.</i>

254
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:00,310
<i>Finish it off.</i>

255
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,923
<i>Who needs it alive... Let us kill him. Kill him, kill him, now!</i>

256
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:06,675
<i>Let us feast... feast... feast.</i>

257
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:10,158
<i>Feast... feast!</i>

258
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:21,858
<i>What is it?</i>

259
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,886
<i>Fat and juicy!</i>

260
00:28:35,351 --> 00:28:38,385
<i>Just a little taste!</i>

261
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,964
<i>Curse it! Where is it? Where is it?!</i>

262
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,170
Here!

263
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,113
<i>It stings... Stings!</i>

264
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:04,724
Sting.

265
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:06,817
That's a good name.

266
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:09,940
Sting.

267
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,556
Where is Bilbo?

268
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,181
I'm up here!

269
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,903
Where is it? Where's it?

270
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:19,542
Come on! Where is it?

271
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,602
Thorin!

272
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,467
Kili!

273
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,452
Mine!

274
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,753
Come on, keep up!

275
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,535
We are clear!

276
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:23,687
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

277
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,013
It would be my pleasure.

278
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,661
Kili!

279
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,863
Throw me a dagger!

280
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,477
Quick!

281
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:57,878
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf, you are mistaken.

282
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:04,486
Search them!

283
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:12,558
Hey, give it back! That's private!

284
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,138
Who's this?

285
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:17,156
- Your brother?  - That is my wife!

286
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:21,174
And, what is this horrid creature? A Goblin Mutant?

287
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:23,519
That's my wee lad, Gimli!

288
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:31,452


289
00:33:32,154 --> 00:33:34,350


290
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:37,397


291
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:48,020


292
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:52,993


293
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,483
Where did you get this?

294
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,853
It was given to me.

295
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:03,075
Not just a thief...

296
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,835
but a liar as well.

297
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,601
<i>Take them away!</i>

298
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:10,923
Thorin, Where is Bilbo?

299
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,020


300
00:35:15,402 --> 00:35:16,981
This is not the end of it!

301
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:18,873
Do you hear me?!

302
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:20,674
Let us out of here!

303
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:31,690
Aren't you going to search me?

304
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,722
I could have anything down my trousers?

305
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:37,010
Or, nothing.

306
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:48,476


307
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:50,504


308
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:54,321


309
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,137


310
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,104


311
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,004


312
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,936
- Arhhg... again!  - Leave it!

313
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:15,136
There is no way out!

314
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:20,769
This is no Orc dungeon. These are the Halls of the Woodland realm.

315
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:25,220
No one leaves here, but, by the King's consent.

316
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:33,179
Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand.

317
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:38,390
A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon.

318
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:44,152
I myself, suspect a more prosaic motive.

319
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,327
Attempted burglary...

320
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:50,167
or something of that ilk.

321
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:54,662
You have found a way in?

322
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:59,315
You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule.

323
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:01,831
A King's Jewel.

324
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,181
The Arkenstone.

325
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:08,919
It is precious to you, beyond measure.

326
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:13,370
I understand that.

327
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,784
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire.

328
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:22,696
White gems, a pure starlight.

329
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,910
I offer you my help.

330
00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:29,341
I am listening.

331
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,325
I will let you go.

332
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:35,378
If you but return what is mine.

333
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:39,727
A favour, for a favour.

334
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:41,543
You have my word.

335
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:44,640
One King to another.

336
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,244
I would not trust, Thranduil.

337
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:57,585
The great king, to only his word. Till the end of all days be upon us.

338
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,047
You!

339
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:02,085
Lack all honour!

340
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:07,284
I've seen how you treat your friends. We came to you once...

341
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:11,460
Starving, homeless, seeking your help.

342
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,185
But you turned your back!

343
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:17,499
You, turned away from the suffering of my people.

344
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:20,156
The infernal that destroyed us!

345
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,572
<i>Die a death of flames!</i>

346
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:25,505
Do not talk to me of dragonfire!

347
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:28,233
I know it's wrath and ruin.

348
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:38,430
I have faced... the great serpents of the north.

349
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:43,417
I warned your grandfather, of what his greed would summon.

350
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:48,370
But he would not listen.

351
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:53,348
You are just like him.

352
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:59,449
Stay here if you will and rot.

353
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:03,562
A hundred years is a mere blink in a life of an elf.

354
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,675
I am patient.

355
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:09,232
I can wait.

356
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,392
- Did he offer you a deal?  - He did.

357
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:23,390
I told him he could go <i>and I'll shit upon your grave!</i>

358
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,047
Him and all his kin!

359
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:29,367
Well, that's that then.

360
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:33,638
The deal... was our only hope.

361
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:39,393
It's not our only hope.

362
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,319
I know you are there.

363
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:51,598
Why do you linger in the shadows?

364
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:55,437
I was coming to report to you.

365
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:59,784
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.

366
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:02,383
We cleared the forest as ordered, my Lord.

367
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:04,651
But more spiders keep coming up from the south.

368
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:08,146
They're spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur. If we could kill them at their source...

369
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,632
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

370
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:13,309
Keep our lands, clear of those foul creatures. That is your task.

371
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:16,477
And when we drive them off, what then?

372
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:18,494
Will they not spread to other lands?

373
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:21,063
Other lands are not my concern.

374
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:24,878
Fortunes of the world will rise and fall.

375
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:28,498
But here in this kingdom, we will endure.

376
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,749
Legolas said you fought well today.

377
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,583
He's grown very fond of you.

378
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,681
I assure you my Lord,

379
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,907
Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.

380
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:51,913
Perhaps he did... once.

381
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,843
Now, I'm not so sure.

382
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,666
I... do not think that you would allow your son

383
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,342
to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan elf.

384
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:06,987
No, you are right. l would not.

385
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:09,675
Still, he cares about you.

386
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:13,177
Do not give him hope, where there is none.

387
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,527


388
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,706


389
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,779
The stone in your hand, What is it?

390
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,069
It is a Talisman.

391
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,774
A powerful spell has upon it.

392
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:05,772
If any but a dwarf reads the runes on the stone,

393
00:42:06,488 --> 00:42:08,221
it will be forever cursed.

394
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,380
Or not.

395
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,417
Depending on whether you believe in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

396
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:23,901
The Rune Stone.

397
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,209


398
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:28,684
My mother gave me it to me. So, I'd remember my promise.

399
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:31,910
What promise?

400
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,427
That I would come back to her.

401
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,206
She worries.

402
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,253
She thinks I'm reckless.

403
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:42,453
Are you?

404
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,170
Nah.

405
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:59,758
Sounds like quite... a party, you're having up there.

406
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,831
It is Mereth-en-Gilith.

407
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,154
The Feast of Starlight.

408
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:08,908
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

409
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:12,521
But the Wood-elves loves best, the light of the stars.

410
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:16,422
I always thought it is a cold light.

411
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,110
Remote and far away.

412
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:22,526
It is memory.

413
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:25,862
Precious and pure.

414
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,268
Like your promise.

415
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:43,305
I have walked there sometimes.

416
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:46,684
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

417
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:51,469
I have seen the world full away.

418
00:43:52,149 --> 00:43:55,387
And the white light, forever filled the air.

419
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,233
I saw a fire moon once.

420
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:06,387
It rose off the path near Dunland. Huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.

421
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:12,510
We were in escort with some merchants in Ered Luin. They were...

422
00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:16,095
trading in silver work for furs. We took the Greenway south,

423
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:18,210
keeping the mountain to our left.

424
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:20,398
But then, it appeared.

425
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:24,613
This huge fire moon lights in our path.

426
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,584
I wish I could show you...

427
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,683
Galion, you old rogue! We're running out of drink.

428
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:34,872
These empty barrels should have been sent to Esgaroth hours ago. 

429
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,718
Bard have been waiting for them,

430
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:41,923
Say what you like about our ill tempered King who has excellent taste in wine.

431
00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:44,890
Come, Elros, try it.

432
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:47,054
I have the dwarves in my charge.

433
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:50,163
They're locked up, where can they go?

434
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:58,237
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

435
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,655
We never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

436
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,594
Not stuck in here you're not.

437
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,358
Bilbo!

438
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,512
There are guards nearby!

439
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,615
- What's that?  - You first.

440
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,225
- Ori!  - Not that way. Down here... follow me!

441
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,793
- Which way?  - Come on, go!

442
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,164
This way.

443
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:08,085
- Come on.  - I don't believe, we're in the cellars.

444
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:10,073
You're supposed to be leading us unknown... further away.

445
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,752
- I know what I'm doing.  - Shhh.

446
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,648
Okay, this way. This way.

447
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,743
Everyone, climb into the barrels... quickly!

448
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,577
Are you mad? They will find us.

449
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:25,137
No, no. They won't! I promise you.

450
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:28,610
Please, please... You must trust me.

451
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,494
Do as he says.

452
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:54,711
What do we do now?

453
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:58,126
- Hold your breath.  - Hold my breath... What do you mean?

454
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,475
Where is the keeper of the keys?

455
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,746
<i>Come now!</i>

456
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,458
Well done, Master Baggins.

457
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:58,280
Go, come on let's go!

458
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:09,472
Hold on!

459
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:23,248
Bilbo!

460
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:38,388


461
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,189
No!

462
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:12,978
Watch out!

463
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,584
<i>Kill them! Quickly!</i>

464
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,520


465
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:34,648
Get over the bridge!

466
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,916
Die!

467
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:14,579
Kili!

468
00:50:21,222 --> 00:50:22,045
Kili!

469
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:39,245


470
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,661
<i>The dwarves are escaping!</i>

471
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,583


472
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:16,779
Kili!

473
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,943
Nori!

474
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,832
Cut the log!

475
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,800
Bombur!

476
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:41,386
<i>Tauriel!</i>

477
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:42,863


478
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:47,639


479
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:52,574


480
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:59,492
<i>Don't let them go away!</i>

481
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,769
Oh, it's you.

482
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,969
Why am I here, Gandalf?

483
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:46,245
Trust me, Radagast. I would not have call you here without good reason.

484
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:54,570
- This is not a nice place to meet.  - No.

485
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:58,247
It is not.

486
00:56:58,326 --> 00:57:01,425
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

487
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:04,583
Old... And full of hate.

488
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,783
Who's buried here?

489
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:09,518
If he had a name, it's long since been lost.

490
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:13,808
He would've been known only as a servant of evil.

491
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,221
One of a number.

492
00:57:22,836 --> 00:57:25,502
One of nine.

493
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:29,518
Why now, Gandalf?

494
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:33,102
- I don't understand!  - The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

495
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:35,525
But, it cannot be the Necromancer.

496
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,791
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

497
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:41,479
Who said it was human.

498
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,234
And, Nine only answers to One Master.

499
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:49,484
We've been blind, Radagast.

500
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:50,879
And in our blindness...

501
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:54,461
The Enemy has returned.

502
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:58,667
He is summoning his servants.

503
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,561
Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.

504
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:07,614
He is a commander, the commander of legions.

505
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:11,543
The Enemy... is preparing for war.

506
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,997
Which will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.

507
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:19,101
- Where are you going?  - To rejoin the others.

508
00:58:19,377 --> 00:58:21,006
Gandalf?!

509
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,876
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

510
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,587
They're in grave danger.

511
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,965
If what you say is true.

512
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:32,000
The world is in grave danger.

513
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,686
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

514
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:40,700
You want me to cast my friends aside.

515
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:44,751
Anything behind us?

516
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:46,219
Not that I can see.

517
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:54,016
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.  - Not for long. We've lost the current.

518
00:58:54,486 --> 00:58:55,754
We are almost half drowned!

519
00:58:56,727 --> 00:58:58,201
Make for the shore!

520
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:00,366
Come on! Let's go.

521
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,678
I'm fine, it's nothing.

522
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:25,887
- On your feet.  - Kili is wounded. His leg needs binding.

523
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:28,647
There's an Orc pack at our tail. We keep moving.

524
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,643
- To where?  - To the mountain. We are so close.

525
00:59:31,843 --> 00:59:34,868
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

526
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:37,575
- We have no way to cross it.  - So then, we go arround.

527
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,423
The Orcs will run us down, as sure as daylight.

528
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,282
We have no weapons to defend ourselves.

529
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,482
Bind his leg, quickly.

530
00:59:45,522 --> 00:59:48,035
We have two minutes.

531
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:10,516
Do it again and you are dead.

532
01:00:12,397 --> 01:00:15,912
Excuse me, but uh... You're from Lake-town?

533
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,112
If I'm not mistaken.

534
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,747
That barge over there,

535
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:24,481
it wouldn't be available for hire by any chance?

536
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,252
What makes you think, I would help you?

537
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,355
Those boots have seen better days.

538
01:00:30,555 --> 01:00:32,348
As has that coat.

539
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:35,493
I've no doubts you have some hungry mouths to feed.

540
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,208
How many bairns?

541
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:40,545
A boy and two girls.

542
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:44,588
And your wife, I imagine she's as a beauty?

543
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,433
Aye.

544
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,239
She was.

545
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:55,801
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...  - Oh, come on! C'mon, enough with the niceties.

546
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:59,310
- What's your hurry?  - What's it to you?

547
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,510
I would like to know who you are.

548
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,091
And what you are doing in these lands.

549
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:07,046
We are simple merchants, from the Blue Mountains.

550
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:10,417
Journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

551
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:13,580
Simple merchants, you say?

552
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,557
We need food, supplies, weapons.

553
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:19,194
Can you help us?

554
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,805
I know where these barrels came from.

555
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:30,128
- What of it?  - I don't know what business you had with the elves.

556
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:32,951
But, I don't think it ended well.

557
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:37,261
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of the master.

558
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:40,647
All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.

559
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:43,878
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

560
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:46,699
Offer him more.

561
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:52,251
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

562
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:53,934
Aye.

563
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,964
But for that...

564
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,319
- you would need a smuggler.  - For which we would pay.

565
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,414
Double.

566
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,955
Such is the nature of evil.

567
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:18,244
Out there in the vast, ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.

568
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:21,098
A shadow that grows in the dark.

569
01:02:21,098 --> 01:02:26,668
A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.

570
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:32,334
So it ever was... So will it always be.

571
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:37,043
In time, all foul things come forth.

572
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:41,598
You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves, why?

573
01:02:41,598 --> 01:02:45,054
Not thirteen, not anymore.

574
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:49,244
The young one, the black head archer.

575
01:02:49,444 --> 01:02:52,473
We stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

576
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,462
The poison's in his blood.

577
01:02:55,662 --> 01:02:57,480
He'll be choking on it soon.

578
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:00,022
Answer the question, filth!

579
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:03,107


580
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:07,930
I would not antagonize her.

581
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,602
You like killing things, Orc?

582
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:12,736
You like death?

583
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:14,883
Then, let me give it to you!

584
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:16,058


585
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,342


586
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,161


587
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:35,347
I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

588
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:37,552
You have nothing to fear.

589
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:41,538
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

590
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,550
You had orders to kill them, why?

591
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,861
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

592
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:51,170
- The dwarf runt will never be king.  - King?!

593
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,128
There is no king under the mountain, nor will there ever be.

594
01:03:54,775 --> 01:03:57,126
None would dare enter Erebor.

595
01:03:57,126 --> 01:04:00,463
- Whilst the dragon lives.  - You know nothing.

596
01:04:00,663 --> 01:04:03,348
Your world will burn.

597
01:04:03,348 --> 01:04:06,531
What are you talking about? Speak!

598
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:09,959
Our time has come again.

599
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:15,161
My master serves... The One.

600
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:18,030
Do you understand now, Elfling?

601
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,900
Death is upon you.

602
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:24,154
The flames... of war, are upon you!

603
01:04:27,214 --> 01:04:28,795
Why did you do that?

604
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,792
You promised to set him free.

605
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:32,365
And I did.

606
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:37,743
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

607
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,537
There was more the orc could tell us.

608
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:43,358
There was nothing more he could tell me.

609
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:46,755
What did he mean by the flames of war?

610
01:04:46,955 --> 01:04:52,076
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great, it will destroy all before it.

611
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:56,186
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.

612
01:04:56,186 --> 01:04:58,258
Nothing moves but I hear of it.

613
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,891
No one enters this kingdom...

614
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:03,199
And no one leaves it.

615
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,234


616
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,719


617
01:05:11,596 --> 01:05:12,768


618
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:16,762


619
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,371


620
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:20,984


621
01:05:21,591 --> 01:05:23,178


622
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:48,780


623
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:50,203


624
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,488


625
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,108


626
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:06,296


627
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:29,053
Watch out!

628
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:40,361
What are you trying to do, drown us?

629
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:43,427
I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf.

630
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:46,794
If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.

631
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,389
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy lake-man.

632
01:06:51,389 --> 01:06:52,904
I say, we throw him off the side...

633
01:06:52,904 --> 01:06:56,227
- and be done with him.  - No, Bard... His name is Bard.

634
01:06:56,227 --> 01:06:57,333
How do you know?

635
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:01,839
- Ah, I asked him.  - I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.

636
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,463
We do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.

637
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:08,593
Come on now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

638
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:12,748
- How do we know he won't betray us?  - We don't.

639
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:17,094
There's um... just a wee problem.

640
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:19,267
We are ten coins short.

641
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:22,021
Gloin.

642
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:24,880
Come on, give us what you have.

643
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,024
Don't look to me.

644
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:30,996
I have been bled dry by this venture.

645
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:34,163
What have I seen for my investment?

646
01:07:34,363 --> 01:07:38,008
Nought but misery, grief, and...

647
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:47,881
Bless, my beard.

648
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:49,830
Take it.

649
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,192
Take all of it.

650
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:57,565
The money, quick! Give it to me.

651
01:07:57,565 --> 01:08:00,169
We will pay you when we get our provisions. But not before.

652
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:02,924
If you value your freedom, you will do as I say.

653
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:05,490
There are guards ahead.

654
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:24,288
Ssh. What is he doing?

655
01:08:24,925 --> 01:08:26,617
He is talking to someone.

656
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:30,465
He is... pointing right at us.

657
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:35,724
- Now they're shaking hands.  - What?

658
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:38,160
He's selling us out.

659
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:00,685
Oh, good God!

660
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:01,885
Quite!

661
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:06,129
We are approaching the toll gate.

662
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:20,075
Halt! Goods inspection.

663
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:22,570
Papers, please!

664
01:09:23,404 --> 01:09:26,038
- Oh, it's you, Bard!  - Morning, Percy.

665
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,731
- Anything to declare?  - Nothing,

666
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,945
but I am cold and tired. I'm ready for home.

667
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:34,490
You and me, both.

668
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:40,097
There we are, all in order.

669
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,151
Not... so... fast.

670
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:46,193
Consignment of empty barrels,

671
01:09:46,393 --> 01:09:48,319
from the Woodland realm.

672
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,322
Only...

673
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:55,528
they are not empty, are they, Bard?

674
01:09:55,528 --> 01:10:00,024
If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman.

675
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:02,522
Not...

676
01:10:02,522 --> 01:10:04,102
a fisherman.

677
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:05,886
That's none of your business.

678
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:10,943
Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

679
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,887
Oh, come on... Alfrid. Have a heart. People need to eat!

680
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:16,907
These fish are illegal.

681
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:18,735
Empty barrels over the side.

682
01:10:18,735 --> 01:10:20,720
- You heard him.  - In the canal.

683
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:23,820
Come on... Get a move on.

684
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:26,516
Folk in this town are struggling.

685
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:28,951
Times are hard. Food is scarce.

686
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:30,754
That's not my problem.

687
01:10:30,754 --> 01:10:34,461
And when people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake?

688
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:36,733
When the rioting starts?

689
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:42,137
Will it be your problem, then?

690
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:47,522
Stop!

691
01:10:50,102 --> 01:10:53,079
Ever the people's champion, eh, Bard?

692
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,634
Protector of the common folk. You might have their favor now, bargeman,

693
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,329
but it won't last.

694
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,437
Raise the gate!

695
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:09,956
The Master has his eyes on you. You'll do well to remember.

696
01:11:09,956 --> 01:11:11,707
We know where you live.

697
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:12,907
It's a small town, Alfrid.

698
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:17,158
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

699
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,808
All this talk of civil unrest,

700
01:11:34,808 --> 01:11:36,980
someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.

701
01:11:40,202 --> 01:11:41,520
Gout playing out, Sire?

702
01:11:41,554 --> 01:11:43,527
It's the damp! It's the only possible explanation.

703
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,480
Now, get me a brandy.

704
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:49,566
The mood of the people, Sire. It's turning ugly.

705
01:11:49,566 --> 01:11:50,766
They are commoners, Alfrid.

706
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,887
They've always been ugly.

707
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:57,215
It's not my fault they live in a place that stinks of fish, oil and tar.

708
01:11:57,644 --> 01:12:02,995
Jobs, shelter... food. It's all they ever bleat about.

709
01:12:02,995 --> 01:12:06,938
It's my believe, Sire, they're being lead on by troublemakers.

710
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:11,894
Then, we must find these troublemakers. And arrest them.

711
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,643
My thoughts exactly, Sire.

712
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:17,216
And all this talk of a change must be suppressed.

713
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:21,037
We can't afford to let the rabble band together, start making noises.

714
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,662
The next thing you know, they will start asking questions,

715
01:12:24,662 --> 01:12:26,049
forming committees.

716
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:28,950
Launching enquiries.

717
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,843
Out with the old, in with the new.

718
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:33,043
What?

719
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,297
That's what I've been saying, Sire.

720
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:38,956
- There is even talk... of an election.  - An election?

721
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,566
That's absurd! I won't stand for it.

722
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:45,884
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

723
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:51,071
Shirkers, ingrates!

724
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:52,170
Rabble rousers!

725
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,715
Who would have the nerve to question my authority?

726
01:12:55,915 --> 01:12:58,903
Who would dare! Who?

727
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:05,049
Bard!

728
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:10,334
You mark my words, that... trouble making bargeman is behind all this.

729
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,779
Get your hands off me!

730
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:28,736
You didn't see them. They were never here.

731
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,741
The fish, you can have for nothing.

732
01:13:34,445 --> 01:13:35,549
Follow me!

733
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:46,054
Da!

734
01:13:46,578 --> 01:13:49,091
Our house... It's being watched!

735
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:26,841
You can tell the Master I am done for the day.

736
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:29,549
Da!

737
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:30,885
Where have you been?

738
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:34,120
Father, there you are! I was worried.

739
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,358
Here, Sigrid.

740
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:37,653
Bain, get them in.

741
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:49,529
If you speak of this to anyone, I'll rip your hands off!

742
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,672
Get it off.

743
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,589
Up there.

744
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:07,383
Da, why the dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

745
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:09,461
Will they bring us luck?

746
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:15,886
They may not be the best fit, but they will keep you warm.

747
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:18,534
Oh, it's fine. Thank you.

748
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,971
The dwarvish wind-lance!

749
01:15:30,971 --> 01:15:32,171
You look like you've seen a ghost.

750
01:15:33,355 --> 01:15:35,523
He has.

751
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,456
The last time we saw such a weapon,

752
01:15:38,656 --> 01:15:41,729
the city was on fire.

753
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,351
It was the day the dragon came.

754
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:50,391
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

755
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:57,843
Girion, the lord of the city, rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast.

756
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:02,850
But, a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.

757
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:06,864
Only a black arrow fired from a wind-lance

758
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:09,572
could have pierced the dragon's hide.

759
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:12,913
And few of those arrows were ever made.

760
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:22,742
The store was running low when Girion made his last attempt.

761
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:32,224
The aim of men had been true that day,

762
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:35,335
much would be different.

763
01:16:38,957 --> 01:16:41,221
You speak as if you were there.

764
01:16:42,437 --> 01:16:44,772
All dwarves know the tale.

765
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:47,278
And, you would know that Girion hit the dragon.

766
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,441
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

767
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:51,629
One more shot and he would have killed the beast.

768
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:56,015
That's a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

769
01:16:57,054 --> 01:16:59,462
You took our money.

770
01:16:59,498 --> 01:17:01,996
Where are the weapons?

771
01:17:03,312 --> 01:17:04,897
Wait here.

772
01:17:19,471 --> 01:17:21,305
Tomorrow begins the last days of Autumn.

773
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:23,777
Durin's day falls the morning after next.

774
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,165
We must reach the mountain before then.

775
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:27,502
And, if we do not?

776
01:17:27,702 --> 01:17:30,703
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time,

777
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:32,535
then this quest has been for nothing.

778
01:17:44,056 --> 01:17:47,063
- What is this?  - Pike hook.

779
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:49,170
Made from an old harpoon.

780
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:51,146
- And this?  - A crowbill, we call it.

781
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:53,058
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

782
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:54,969
It's heavy in hand, I grand. But...

783
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:58,240
In defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

784
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,070
We paid you for weapons.

785
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:04,255
Iron forged, swords and axes!

786
01:18:04,455 --> 01:18:06,134
It's a joke!

787
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,134
You won't find better outside the city armory.

788
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:12,965
All iron forged weapons are held there under lock and key.

789
01:18:12,965 --> 01:18:16,784
Thorin, why not take what's on offer and go?

790
01:18:16,784 --> 01:18:19,143
I've made do with less, so have you.

791
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:24,109
- I say, we leave now.  - You're not going anywhere!

792
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:26,554
- What did you say?  - There are spies watching this house,

793
01:18:26,554 --> 01:18:29,081
and probably every dock and wharf in the town.

794
01:18:30,057 --> 01:18:31,822
You must wait till nightfall.

795
01:18:48,035 --> 01:18:49,789
Thorin.

796
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:04,129
Da?

797
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:08,418
Don't let them leave.

798
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,128


799
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:36,991


800
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,654


801
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,844
Tauriel...

802
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:45,521
You cannot hunt thirty orcs on your own.

803
01:19:45,521 --> 01:19:47,559
But I'm not on my own.

804
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,297
You knew I would come.

805
01:19:52,019 --> 01:19:53,996
The King is angry, Tauriel.

806
01:19:54,444 --> 01:19:57,700
For 600 years my father has protected you, favoured you...

807
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:01,079
you defied his orders. You betrayed his trust.

808
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,293


809
01:20:04,293 --> 01:20:06,272


810
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:07,585


811
01:20:07,894 --> 01:20:10,673


812
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:14,165
The King has never let orc filth roam our lands.

813
01:20:14,165 --> 01:20:17,551
But he would let these orc packs cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

814
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,151
It is not our fight.

815
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:20,291
It is our fight.

816
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:23,106
It will not end here.

817
01:20:23,106 --> 01:20:26,083
With every victory, this evil will grow.

818
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:29,313
If your father has his way, we will do nothing.

819
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:31,469
We will hide withing our walls.

820
01:20:31,469 --> 01:20:34,384
Live our lives away from the light...

821
01:20:34,384 --> 01:20:36,577
and let darkness descend.

822
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,975
Are we not part of this world?

823
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,295
Tell me, <i>mellon</i>,

824
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:45,368
When did we let evil become stronger than us?

825
01:20:50,394 --> 01:20:52,836
Hello Bard, who are you after?

826
01:20:54,457 --> 01:20:55,997
There was a tapestry.

827
01:20:56,217 --> 01:20:57,447
An old one.

828
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,160
- Where is it gone?  - What tapestry are you talking about?

829
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:01,687
This one!

830
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:05,215
They were dwarves I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.

831
01:21:05,215 --> 01:21:08,787
Full beards, fierce eyes. I've never seen the like.

832
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:13,034
- What are dwarves doing in these parts?  - It's the prophecy.

833
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,583
- What prophecy?  - Prophecy of Durin's folk.

834
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:26,553
Prophecy?

835
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:30,875
Prophecy.

836
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:32,900
The old tales may come true.

837
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,096
Vast golds and treasure!

838
01:21:35,096 --> 01:21:38,859
Can it really be true? Has the Lord of Silver Fountains returned?

839
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:42,713
The Lord of Silver Fountains.

840
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:44,968
The King of Carven Stone.

841
01:21:46,797 --> 01:21:49,615
The king beneath the mountain...

842
01:21:49,615 --> 01:21:51,959
shall come into his own.

843
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:57,507
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.

844
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,787
But all shall fade in sadness.

845
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:05,061
And the lake will shine and burn.

846
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:09,639
- Da, I tried to stop them.  - How long have they been gone?!

847
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,653
Shh. Keep it down.

848
01:22:15,653 --> 01:22:18,350
As soon as we have the weapons, we'll make straight for the mountain.

849
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,550
Go... go... go!

850
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:25,690
Next!

851
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:42,524
- Are you alright?  - I can manage.

852
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:43,724
Let's just get out of here.

853
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,210
Run!

854
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:30,503
What is the meaning of this?

855
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:32,687
We caught them stealing weapons, Sire.

856
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:35,826
Ah, enemies of the state... eh?

857
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:39,088
A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, Sire.

858
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,777
Hold your tongue!

859
01:23:42,945 --> 01:23:45,745
You do not know to whom you speak!

860
01:23:45,745 --> 01:23:47,750
This is no common criminal.

861
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:51,243
This is Thorin. Son of Thrain...

862
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:52,443
Son of Thror.

863
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:58,182
We are the dwarves of Erebor.

864
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:03,163
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

865
01:24:08,517 --> 01:24:11,630
I remember this town in the great days of old.

866
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:17,326
Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems.

867
01:24:17,326 --> 01:24:20,201
This was no forsaken town on a lake...

868
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:24,810
This was the center of all trade in the north.

869
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:27,905
I will see those days returned.

870
01:24:27,905 --> 01:24:30,438
I would relight the great forges of the dwarves

871
01:24:30,849 --> 01:24:34,884
and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!

872
01:24:37,562 --> 01:24:38,903
Death!

873
01:24:38,903 --> 01:24:41,583
That is what you will bring upon us.

874
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,983
Dragon fire and ruin.

875
01:24:46,244 --> 01:24:48,718
If you awaken that beast,

876
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:50,783
it will destroy us all.

877
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:54,631
You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this:

878
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,579
If we succeed,

879
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:03,194
all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

880
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:11,408
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!

881
01:25:13,269 --> 01:25:16,039
All of you, listen to me!

882
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:19,574
You must listen. Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?

883
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,879
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?

884
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:25,037
No!

885
01:25:26,438 --> 01:25:28,124
And for what purpose?

886
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,680
The blind ambition of a Mountain King,

887
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,581
so driven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

888
01:25:37,259 --> 01:25:43,646
Now, now! We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame.

889
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:49,157
Let us not forget, that it was Girion, lord of Dale,

890
01:25:49,157 --> 01:25:53,609
your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast!

891
01:25:56,297 --> 01:25:59,536
He is true, Sire. We all know the story.

892
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:05,924
Arrow after arrow, he shot. Each one missing it's mark.

893
01:26:12,326 --> 01:26:13,882
You have no right.

894
01:26:15,223 --> 01:26:17,266
No right to enter that mountain.

895
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:21,667
I have the only right.

896
01:26:27,293 --> 01:26:30,626
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.

897
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:32,619
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

898
01:26:34,136 --> 01:26:39,736
Will you share in the great wealth of our people?

899
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:46,071
What say you?

900
01:26:49,253 --> 01:26:52,755
I say unto you...

901
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:55,628
welcome!

902
01:26:55,628 --> 01:27:01,063
Welcome and rise! Welcome, King Under the Mountain!

903
01:27:12,815 --> 01:27:14,225
You do know we're one short?

904
01:27:14,225 --> 01:27:16,775
- Where is Bofur?  - He is not here, we'll leave him behind.

905
01:27:16,775 --> 01:27:17,975
We will have to,

906
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:21,431
if we are to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.

907
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:27,458
Not you.

908
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:30,424
We must travel at speed. You will slow us down.

909
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,273
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

910
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:34,273
No, no.

911
01:27:39,761 --> 01:27:42,047
I'm going to be there when that door's opened.

912
01:27:42,047 --> 01:27:44,405
When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...

913
01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:48,965
Kili, stay here... rest.

914
01:27:48,965 --> 01:27:51,168
Join us when you're healed.

915
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:59,750
I'll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.

916
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,950
Uncle...

917
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:04,912
we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us...

918
01:28:04,957 --> 01:28:06,779
You cannot take that away from him.

919
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:08,602
- Fili.  - I will carry him, if I must.

920
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:11,279
One day you will be King and you will understand.

921
01:28:11,849 --> 01:28:15,204
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf.

922
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,331
Not even my own kin.

923
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:25,224
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

924
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:26,474
I belong with my brother.

925
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:41,942
By my beard! Is that the time!

926
01:28:43,227 --> 01:28:46,375
Go now with our good will.

927
01:28:48,558 --> 01:28:54,236
- and may your return bring fortune to all! - Wait!

928
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,634
Goodbye!

929
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,823
Did you miss the boat as well?

930
01:29:16,823 --> 01:29:18,023
Kili? Kili!

931
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:25,033
No. I am done with dwarves. Go away!

932
01:29:25,378 --> 01:29:26,850
No, no. Please!

933
01:29:26,885 --> 01:29:28,938
No one will help us. Kili is sick.

934
01:29:31,568 --> 01:29:33,474
He is very sick.

935
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:15,329
What is this place?

936
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:17,604
It was once the city of Dale.

937
01:30:18,591 --> 01:30:20,121
Now, it is a ruin.

938
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:25,407
- The Desolation of Smaug.  - The sun will soon reached mid-day.

939
01:30:25,407 --> 01:30:28,326
We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets.

940
01:30:28,326 --> 01:30:31,234
- This way!  - Wait. Is this... the overlook?

941
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:35,268
- Gandalf said to meet him here, on no account were we to...  - Do you see him?

942
01:30:35,268 --> 01:30:37,697
We have no time to wait on our wizard.

943
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,780
We are on our own. Come!

944
01:30:56,774 --> 01:30:58,945
Dol Guldur.

945
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:01,248
The hill of sorcerer.

946
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,607
It looks completely abandoned.

947
01:31:03,607 --> 01:31:05,651
As it is meant to.

948
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:09,958
A spell of concealment lies over this place.

949
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:13,967
Which means our Enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself.

950
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:20,308
He has not regained his full strength.

951
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,552
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to Lady Galadriel.

952
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:26,143
Tell her, we must force his hand.

953
01:31:26,343 --> 01:31:28,716
- What do you mean?  - I am going in alone.

954
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:31,835
On no account come after me.

955
01:31:37,722 --> 01:31:41,532
- Do I have your word?  - Yes, yes... yes.

956
01:31:53,362 --> 01:31:55,060
Wait Gandalf!

957
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,955
What if it's a trap?

958
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:00,718
Turn around...

959
01:32:00,753 --> 01:32:03,393
and do not come back.

960
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,187
It's undoubtedly a trap.

961
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:47,942


962
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:51,385


963
01:32:52,487 --> 01:32:55,123


964
01:33:10,059 --> 01:33:13,721
<i>Ce na ulco sis nurtaina...</i>

965
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,772
<i>I ettuluvas caninye!</i>

966
01:33:16,851 --> 01:33:19,303


967
01:33:19,684 --> 01:33:21,555


968
01:33:21,925 --> 01:33:23,255


969
01:33:23,757 --> 01:33:26,519


970
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,728
- Anything?!  - Nothing!

971
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:43,899
If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us.

972
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:50,503
Up here!

973
01:33:58,683 --> 01:34:01,526
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

974
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:34,131
This must be it.

975
01:34:36,318 --> 01:34:37,774
The hidden door.

976
01:34:42,029 --> 01:34:46,710
Let all those who doubted us, rue this day!

977
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:54,672
Hey, we have a key.

978
01:34:56,284 --> 01:35:00,253
Which means, there'is somewhere there is a key hole.

979
01:35:01,006 --> 01:35:04,389
The last light of Durin's day...

980
01:35:05,771 --> 01:35:07,722
will shine upon the keyhole.

981
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:18,490
- Nori.  - Yeah.

982
01:35:25,318 --> 01:35:27,176
We are losing the light, come on!

983
01:35:33,717 --> 01:35:36,334
Be quiet. I can't hear when you're thumping!

984
01:35:36,334 --> 01:35:37,347
I can't find it!

985
01:35:38,964 --> 01:35:41,707
It's not here! It's not here!

986
01:35:43,049 --> 01:35:44,206
Break it down!

987
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,654
Come on!

988
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:51,940
We lost the light.

989
01:35:52,473 --> 01:35:53,642
It's no good!

990
01:35:53,642 --> 01:35:56,955
The door is sealed. It can't be opened by force!

991
01:35:58,025 --> 01:35:59,705
Powerful magic on it.

992
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,044
No!

993
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,755
"The last light of Durin's day,

994
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:20,858
will shine upon the keyhole."

995
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:27,995
That is what it says.

996
01:36:31,474 --> 01:36:33,181
What did we miss?

997
01:36:36,614 --> 01:36:39,003
What did we miss?

998
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:40,203
Balin?

999
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:42,690
We have lost the light.

1000
01:36:44,889 --> 01:36:47,727
There is no more to be done.

1001
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:50,136
We had but one chance.

1002
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:56,116
Come away, lads. Let's move on.

1003
01:36:57,221 --> 01:36:58,631
Wait a minute. What...

1004
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:03,213
Where are they going?

1005
01:37:05,225 --> 01:37:07,386
You can't give up now!

1006
01:37:21,867 --> 01:37:23,357
Thorin...

1007
01:37:25,195 --> 01:37:27,329
you can't give up now.

1008
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:44,696
Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks.

1009
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:47,332
The setting sun...

1010
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:50,786
and the last light of Durin's day will shine.

1011
01:37:52,511 --> 01:37:54,113
The last light...

1012
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:58,121
Last light.

1013
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:35,740
And the last light!

1014
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:47,020
The keyhole!

1015
01:38:47,675 --> 01:38:50,100
Come back! Come back!

1016
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,896
It is the light of the moon. The last moon of autumn!

1017
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,202
Where is the key? Where is the...

1018
01:39:02,738 --> 01:39:04,334
It was... it was here.

1019
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,293
It was... just...

1020
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,361
Erebor!

1021
01:40:06,097 --> 01:40:07,969
Thorin.

1022
01:40:20,498 --> 01:40:22,813
I know these walls.

1023
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,610
These walls...

1024
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:32,874
this stone.

1025
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:38,418
You remember it, Balin?

1026
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:44,183
Chambers filled with golden light.

1027
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,058
I remember.

1028
01:41:00,863 --> 01:41:05,935
Here in lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.

1029
01:41:07,626 --> 01:41:15,014
May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.

1030
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:18,231
The throne of King.

1031
01:41:22,133 --> 01:41:25,009
And what's that above it?

1032
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:31,016
The Arkenstone.

1033
01:41:31,935 --> 01:41:33,473
Arkenstone.

1034
01:41:37,104 --> 01:41:38,917
And what's that?

1035
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:44,288
That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.

1036
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:05,281
Can you not do something?

1037
01:42:05,281 --> 01:42:07,919
I need herbs. Something to bring down this fever.

1038
01:42:08,194 --> 01:42:10,847
I have nightshade, feverfew...

1039
01:42:10,847 --> 01:42:13,374
They are no use to me. Do you have any kingsfoil?

1040
01:42:13,374 --> 01:42:16,219
No... It's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1041
01:42:16,419 --> 01:42:20,486
Pigs? Weed... right.

1042
01:42:21,454 --> 01:42:22,545
Don't move.

1043
01:42:25,283 --> 01:42:29,306
You want me... to find the jewel?

1044
01:42:30,768 --> 01:42:33,642
A large white jewel. Yes!

1045
01:42:35,751 --> 01:42:38,356
That's it? Only... I imagine there's quite a few down there.

1046
01:42:38,356 --> 01:42:42,043
There is only one Arkenstone.

1047
01:42:42,243 --> 01:42:43,897
You will know it when you see it.

1048
01:42:45,513 --> 01:42:46,490
Right.

1049
01:42:50,355 --> 01:42:52,222
In truth lad...

1050
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:57,116
I... do not know what you will find down there.

1051
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:02,434
You needn't go if you don't want to. There's no dishonor in turning back.

1052
01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:04,312
No... Balin!

1053
01:43:05,052 --> 01:43:07,067
I promised I would do this.

1054
01:43:07,633 --> 01:43:09,280
And I think I must try.

1055
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:16,959
- It never ceases to amaze me.  - What's that?

1056
01:43:16,959 --> 01:43:18,886
The courage of hobbits.

1057
01:43:21,058 --> 01:43:26,715
Go now, with as much luck... as you can muster.

1058
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:36,653
Bilbo...

1059
01:43:37,563 --> 01:43:40,905
if there in fact...

1060
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:44,750
a live dragon down there,

1061
01:43:46,548 --> 01:43:49,165
don't waken it.

1062
01:44:30,952 --> 01:44:34,980
<i>Ce na ulco sis nurtaina...</i>

1063
01:44:35,946 --> 01:44:38,999
<i>I ettuluvas caninye!</i>

1064
01:44:39,922 --> 01:44:44,524
<i>Canin i sa tanuvaxe!</i>

1065
01:44:56,695 --> 01:45:00,946


1066
01:45:01,718 --> 01:45:03,589


1067
01:45:05,821 --> 01:45:07,395
Where is your master?

1068
01:45:08,973 --> 01:45:10,041
Where is he?

1069
01:45:10,886 --> 01:45:13,493


1070
01:45:14,529 --> 01:45:17,227


1071
01:45:30,686 --> 01:45:32,710


1072
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,031


1073
01:45:57,883 --> 01:46:00,081


1074
01:46:01,908 --> 01:46:05,509


1075
01:47:23,677 --> 01:47:26,422
Sauron.

1076
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,358
Hello.

1077
01:48:09,017 --> 01:48:10,232
He's not at home.

1078
01:48:11,727 --> 01:48:13,040
Not at home.

1079
01:48:14,056 --> 01:48:15,237
Good.

1080
01:48:16,927 --> 01:48:19,097
Good, good, good.

1081
01:49:13,086 --> 01:49:14,166
What's that?

1082
01:49:20,769 --> 01:49:22,312
Arkenstone.

1083
01:49:23,095 --> 01:49:24,612
Arkenstone.

1084
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,935
A large... white jewel.

1085
01:49:29,481 --> 01:49:30,518
Very helpful.

1086
01:51:56,578 --> 01:51:58,991
Well..

1087
01:51:59,682 --> 01:52:01,343
Thief!

1088
01:52:02,911 --> 01:52:07,098
I... smell... you.

1089
01:52:07,098 --> 01:52:10,691
I hear your breath.

1090
01:52:11,423 --> 01:52:16,004
I feel your air.

1091
01:52:18,259 --> 01:52:21,642
Where are... you.

1092
01:52:21,842 --> 01:52:24,411
Where are you?

1093
01:52:43,339 --> 01:52:47,441
Come now... Don't be shy.

1094
01:52:47,441 --> 01:52:50,742
Step into the light.

1095
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:55,830
Hhmmm...

1096
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:01,158
There is... something about you.

1097
01:53:03,242 --> 01:53:06,002
Something you carry.

1098
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:09,075
Something made of gold.

1099
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:14,855
But far more... precious!

1100
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,710
There you there,

1101
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:24,729
thief in the shadows.

1102
01:53:27,185 --> 01:53:29,658
I did not come to steal from you.

1103
01:53:29,858 --> 01:53:33,646
Oh Smaug, the unaccessibly wealthy.

1104
01:53:33,646 --> 01:53:36,535
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence,

1105
01:53:36,535 --> 01:53:40,560
to see if you really were as great as the old tales say.

1106
01:53:40,932 --> 01:53:42,637
I did not believe them.

1107
01:53:51,912 --> 01:53:56,423
And, Do you now?!

1108
01:53:57,177 --> 01:53:58,684
Truly.

1109
01:53:59,523 --> 01:54:02,787
The tales and songs,

1110
01:54:02,787 --> 01:54:07,443
fall utterly short of your enormity, oh Smaug...

1111
01:54:07,443 --> 01:54:08,889
the Stupendous.

1112
01:54:08,889 --> 01:54:12,225
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1113
01:54:12,754 --> 01:54:15,214
- No... no.  - No, indeed.

1114
01:54:17,915 --> 01:54:24,945
You seem familiar with my name, but I don't remember smelling your kind before.

1115
01:54:25,145 --> 01:54:29,402
Who are you and where do you come from?

1116
01:54:29,402 --> 01:54:31,893
May I ask?

1117
01:54:41,266 --> 01:54:45,331
- I come from under the hill.  - Under hill?

1118
01:54:48,385 --> 01:54:52,230
And under hills and over hills my path has led.

1119
01:54:52,801 --> 01:54:54,237
And... and

1120
01:54:54,237 --> 01:54:56,574
through the air, I am he who walks unseen.

1121
01:54:56,881 --> 01:54:58,478
Impressive.

1122
01:54:58,678 --> 01:55:01,832
What else do you claim to be?

1123
01:55:01,832 --> 01:55:02,549
I am...

1124
01:55:05,822 --> 01:55:07,545
Luck wearer...

1125
01:55:09,189 --> 01:55:13,482
- Riddle, riddle maker.  - Lovely titles, go on.

1126
01:55:14,085 --> 01:55:20,034
- Barrel rider.  - Barrels. Now that is interesting.

1127
01:55:20,234 --> 01:55:25,076
Then what about your little dwarve friends?

1128
01:55:25,076 --> 01:55:27,806
Where are they hiding?

1129
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:31,437
Da... dwarves?

1130
01:55:31,867 --> 01:55:36,444
No. No, no. No dwarves here. You've got that all wrong.

1131
01:55:36,444 --> 01:55:41,080
I don't think so, barrel rider.

1132
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:47,295
They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.

1133
01:55:47,908 --> 01:55:54,674
Truly, you are mistaken, oh Smaug, chiefest and greatest of calamities.

1134
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:01,200
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar.

1135
01:56:02,556 --> 01:56:06,574
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1136
01:56:06,574 --> 01:56:08,586
No one better.

1137
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,677
It is the gold,

1138
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:16,272
they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

1139
01:56:18,585 --> 01:56:22,016
Did you think I did not know this day would come?

1140
01:56:23,427 --> 01:56:31,068
That a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain?

1141
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:38,862
- Was that an earthquake?  - That, my lad...

1142
01:56:41,993 --> 01:56:43,717
was a dragon.

1143
01:56:52,068 --> 01:56:54,486
- Da?  - It's coming from the mountain.

1144
01:56:58,593 --> 01:57:02,222
You should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.

1145
01:57:02,422 --> 01:57:03,722
And go where?

1146
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:06,817
There is no where to go.

1147
01:57:08,276 --> 01:57:10,441
Are we going to die, Da?

1148
01:57:12,044 --> 01:57:13,133
No, darling.

1149
01:57:13,133 --> 01:57:15,549
The dragon, it's going to kill us.

1150
01:57:26,153 --> 01:57:28,722
Not if I kill it first.

1151
01:57:29,701 --> 01:57:33,388
The king under the mountain is dead.

1152
01:57:33,388 --> 01:57:39,834
I took his throne, I ate his people... like a wolf among sheep.

1153
01:57:42,951 --> 01:57:48,188
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

1154
01:57:48,188 --> 01:57:51,773
My armour is iron!

1155
01:57:59,884 --> 01:58:03,257
No blade can pierce me!

1156
01:58:06,237 --> 01:58:07,089
Alright.

1157
01:58:07,505 --> 01:58:10,373
A Black Arrow. Why did you never tell me?

1158
01:58:10,373 --> 01:58:12,026
Because you did not need to know.

1159
01:58:19,597 --> 01:58:23,262
Listen to me carefully, I need you to distract the guards.

1160
01:58:24,126 --> 01:58:27,455
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I'll slip the arrow to the bow.

1161
01:58:27,455 --> 01:58:29,824
There he is! Guards, after him!

1162
01:58:29,824 --> 01:58:32,766
- Quickly! Down there! Go!  - Stop him!

1163
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:40,415
Stop him!

1164
01:58:48,587 --> 01:58:51,699
- Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find  - No!

1165
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:54,680
- I'll deal with them. Now, go!  - I can't leave you!

1166
01:58:58,086 --> 01:58:59,916
- Braga?  - You are under arrest.

1167
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:03,231
- On what charge?  - Any charge the Master chooses.

1168
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:48,135
- What about Bilbo?  - Give him more time.

1169
01:59:48,335 --> 01:59:51,008
Time to do what? To be killed?

1170
01:59:52,701 --> 01:59:53,950
You are afraid?

1171
01:59:55,657 --> 01:59:58,291
Yes... I'm afraid.

1172
01:59:59,161 --> 02:00:01,818
I fear for you.

1173
02:00:01,818 --> 02:00:04,261
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1174
02:00:04,261 --> 02:00:06,751
A sickness which drove your granfather mad!

1175
02:00:06,751 --> 02:00:10,096
- I am not my grandfather.  - You're not yourself!

1176
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:15,228
- The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.  - I will not risk this quest...

1177
02:00:15,228 --> 02:00:18,435
for the life of one, burglar.

1178
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:24,080
Bilbo... His name is Bilbo.

1179
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:33,027
It's Oakenshield... That filthy dwarvish usurper...

1180
02:00:35,075 --> 02:00:40,458
He sent you in here for the Arkenstone... Didn't he?

1181
02:00:40,458 --> 02:00:41,979
No! No... no.

1182
02:00:41,979 --> 02:00:44,385
I don't know what you're talking about.

1183
02:00:44,585 --> 02:00:46,521
Don't bother denying it.

1184
02:00:46,521 --> 02:00:49,774
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

1185
02:00:51,259 --> 02:00:57,531
But it matters not. Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1186
02:00:58,567 --> 02:01:04,896
A darkness is coming. It will spread to every corner of the land!

1187
02:01:35,862 --> 02:01:39,910
<i>The filthy dwarf rats are somewhere here.</i>

1188
02:01:40,478 --> 02:01:43,203
<i>I can smell them.</i>

1189
02:01:47,818 --> 02:01:51,053
You have been used, thief in the shadow.

1190
02:01:51,053 --> 02:01:54,937
You were only ever a means to an end.

1191
02:01:55,733 --> 02:02:01,922
The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found...

1192
02:02:01,922 --> 02:02:03,957
it worth nothing!

1193
02:02:03,957 --> 02:02:06,610
No. No.

1194
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:10,922
- No, you're lying.  - What did he promise you?

1195
02:02:10,922 --> 02:02:13,216
A share of his treasure?

1196
02:02:13,967 --> 02:02:16,253
As if it were his to give.

1197
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:23,585
I would not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it!

1198
02:02:27,242 --> 02:02:30,251
My teeths are swords!

1199
02:02:30,451 --> 02:02:33,895
My claws are spears!

1200
02:02:35,972 --> 02:02:41,064
My wings... are a hurricane!

1201
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,518
So, it is true.

1202
02:02:48,106 --> 02:02:50,183
The black arrow found its mark.

1203
02:02:50,183 --> 02:02:53,386
- What did you say?  - I was just saying...

1204
02:02:53,386 --> 02:02:54,879
your reputation preceeds you.

1205
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:57,648
Oh Smaug, the tyrannical...

1206
02:02:58,003 --> 02:03:02,787
truly, you have no equal on this earth.

1207
02:03:05,993 --> 02:03:10,165
I am almost tempted to let you take it,

1208
02:03:10,165 --> 02:03:14,237
if only to see Oakenshield suffer.

1209
02:03:14,905 --> 02:03:21,155
Watch it destroy him. Watch it corrupt his heart...

1210
02:03:21,155 --> 02:03:24,228
and drive him mad!

1211
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,919
But I think not, I think our little game ends here.

1212
02:03:32,677 --> 02:03:38,773
So tell me, thief. How do you choose to die?

1213
02:04:26,883 --> 02:04:28,243
<i>Dwarves!</i>

1214
02:04:50,715 --> 02:04:52,798
Da? Is that you, Da?

1215
02:06:40,889 --> 02:06:43,088


1216
02:06:44,147 --> 02:06:45,127


1217
02:06:45,525 --> 02:06:46,820


1218
02:07:05,422 --> 02:07:07,577
- You've killed them all.  - There are others.

1219
02:07:08,276 --> 02:07:09,504
Tauriel, go.

1220
02:07:14,915 --> 02:07:17,404
We are losing him!

1221
02:07:19,884 --> 02:07:20,903
Tauriel?

1222
02:07:44,743 --> 02:07:45,877
<i>Athelas!</i>

1223
02:07:48,826 --> 02:07:50,575
<i>Athelas...</i>

1224
02:07:51,104 --> 02:07:52,957
What are you doing?

1225
02:07:55,064 --> 02:07:57,405
I'm going to save him.

1226
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:19,237
- You are alive!  - Not for much longer!

1227
02:08:19,237 --> 02:08:21,115
- Did you find the Arkenstone?  - The dragon's coming!

1228
02:08:21,115 --> 02:08:22,925
The Arkenstone?

1229
02:08:25,303 --> 02:08:26,930
Did you find it?

1230
02:08:32,347 --> 02:08:33,727
No. We have to get out.

1231
02:08:37,021 --> 02:08:38,501
Thorin?

1232
02:08:41,751 --> 02:08:43,310
Thorin!

1233
02:09:13,408 --> 02:09:16,447
You will burn!

1234
02:09:24,573 --> 02:09:25,703
Come on, Bilbo!

1235
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:39,711
Come on.

1236
02:09:56,744 --> 02:09:58,135
Hold him down.

1237
02:10:06,774 --> 02:10:10,486
<i>May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,</i>

1238
02:10:10,704 --> 02:10:13,150
<i>may he be released from death.</i>

1239
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:16,079
Tilda!

1240
02:10:16,864 --> 02:10:20,752
<i>May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,</i>

1241
02:10:20,752 --> 02:10:22,464
<i>may he be released from death.</i>

1242
02:10:22,823 --> 02:10:26,995
<i>May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,</i>

1243
02:10:26,995 --> 02:10:28,758
<i>may he be released from death.</i>

1244
02:10:28,758 --> 02:10:33,161
<i>May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,</i>

1245
02:10:33,161 --> 02:10:35,225
<i>may he be released from death.</i>

1246
02:10:35,929 --> 02:10:42,034
<i>May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,</i>

1247
02:10:43,519 --> 02:10:46,564
<i>may he be released from death.</i>

1248
02:11:08,992 --> 02:11:10,191
Ssh. Ssh-ssh.

1249
02:11:18,138 --> 02:11:23,177
- We've given him the slip.  - No. He is too cunning for that.

1250
02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:28,212
- So, where to now?  - The western guard room.

1251
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:30,192
There may be a way out.

1252
02:11:30,758 --> 02:11:34,812
- It's too high, there's no chance that way.  - It's our only chance.

1253
02:11:36,426 --> 02:11:37,898
We have to try.

1254
02:11:54,486 --> 02:11:55,696
Come on.

1255
02:12:43,235 --> 02:12:46,752
I've heard tales of the wonders of elvish medicine.

1256
02:12:47,128 --> 02:12:49,782
That was a privelege to witness.

1257
02:12:52,263 --> 02:12:53,444
Tauriel.

1258
02:12:57,596 --> 02:12:58,964
Lie still.

1259
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:08,250
You cannot be her.

1260
02:13:11,812 --> 02:13:13,887
She is far away.

1261
02:13:15,891 --> 02:13:22,140
She... she is far, far away from me.

1262
02:13:23,022 --> 02:13:25,553
She walks...

1263
02:13:25,553 --> 02:13:29,540
under the stars in another world.

1264
02:13:33,494 --> 02:13:35,505
It was just a dream.

1265
02:13:47,261 --> 02:13:50,343
Do you think she could've loved me?

1266
02:13:56,769 --> 02:13:57,974
Stay close.

1267
02:14:07,999 --> 02:14:11,799
That's it then. There's no way out.

1268
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:20,363
The last of our kin.

1269
02:14:24,301 --> 02:14:26,733
They must have come here...

1270
02:14:26,733 --> 02:14:30,136
hoping beyond hope.

1271
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:41,397
We could try to reach the mines.

1272
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:44,278
My last few days.

1273
02:14:46,536 --> 02:14:48,065
No.

1274
02:14:50,913 --> 02:14:53,351
I will not die like this.

1275
02:14:54,468 --> 02:14:58,005
Cowering... clawing for breath.

1276
02:15:03,003 --> 02:15:06,418
- We make for the forges.  - He'll see us, sure as death.

1277
02:15:06,418 --> 02:15:08,057
Not if we split up.

1278
02:15:08,057 --> 02:15:11,028
Thorin, we will never make it.

1279
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:12,590
Some of us might.

1280
02:15:13,124 --> 02:15:15,732
Lead him to the forges.

1281
02:15:16,155 --> 02:15:19,427
We kill the dragon.

1282
02:15:19,824 --> 02:15:24,452
If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.

1283
02:15:26,132 --> 02:15:27,314
This way!

1284
02:15:32,173 --> 02:15:35,144
Flee! Flee!

1285
02:15:35,344 --> 02:15:38,233
Run for your lives!

1286
02:15:38,233 --> 02:15:43,514
- There is nowhere to hide.  - Behind you!

1287
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:54,753
Here!

1288
02:16:25,992 --> 02:16:28,539


1289
02:16:28,903 --> 02:16:31,698


1290
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,518


1291
02:16:44,292 --> 02:16:46,281


1292
02:18:51,768 --> 02:18:53,851
This way! It's this way!

1293
02:18:53,851 --> 02:18:55,540
Come on!

1294
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:57,031
Thorin!

1295
02:19:01,626 --> 02:19:02,718
Follow Balin!

1296
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:05,604
Come on!

1297
02:19:21,075 --> 02:19:22,305
Thorin!

1298
02:19:31,645 --> 02:19:33,331
Hold on!

1299
02:20:10,456 --> 02:20:11,992
Go! Go!

1300
02:20:15,934 --> 02:20:19,841
The plan's not gonna work! These furnaces are stone cold.

1301
02:20:19,841 --> 02:20:23,678
He is right. We've no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1302
02:20:26,249 --> 02:20:28,046
Have we not.

1303
02:20:29,175 --> 02:20:31,909
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!

1304
02:20:36,151 --> 02:20:39,161
You are growing slow and fat...

1305
02:20:40,116 --> 02:20:42,493
in your dotage.

1306
02:20:42,493 --> 02:20:44,625
Slug!

1307
02:20:45,765 --> 02:20:47,810
Take cover. Go!

1308
02:21:14,757 --> 02:21:17,829
Bombur! Get those billows working! Go!

1309
02:21:32,381 --> 02:21:34,364
Bilbo! Up there.

1310
02:21:34,364 --> 02:21:36,490
On my mark, pull that lever.

1311
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:49,415
Balin, can you still mix a flash flame?

1312
02:21:49,415 --> 02:21:51,285
Aye, it will only take a jiffy!

1313
02:21:51,285 --> 02:21:52,285
Come on!

1314
02:21:53,651 --> 02:21:55,032
We don't have a jiffy.

1315
02:22:06,955 --> 02:22:08,462
Where's the sulfur?

1316
02:22:08,462 --> 02:22:10,187
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

1317
02:22:22,138 --> 02:22:23,534
Come on!

1318
02:22:45,119 --> 02:22:46,314
Now!

1319
02:24:42,666 --> 02:24:44,589
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1320
02:25:32,593 --> 02:25:34,896
Keep going, Bilbo! Run!

1321
02:26:20,702 --> 02:26:25,962
You think you can deceive me, barrel rider?

1322
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:30,382
You have come from Lake-town.

1323
02:26:31,795 --> 02:26:37,387
This is some sordid scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves...

1324
02:26:37,387 --> 02:26:40,057
and those miserable tarp trading lakemen.

1325
02:26:41,188 --> 02:26:47,519
Those sniveling cowards with their long bows and black arrows.

1326
02:26:48,161 --> 02:26:53,275
Perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. 

1327
02:26:53,316 --> 02:26:54,157
No.

1328
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,889
This isn't their fault.

1329
02:26:57,889 --> 02:27:00,689
Wait! You cannot go to Lake-town.

1330
02:27:02,505 --> 02:27:06,555
You care about them, do you?

1331
02:27:07,037 --> 02:27:11,866
Good. Then you could watch them die!

1332
02:27:16,365 --> 02:27:20,660
Here! You witless worm!

1333
02:27:26,148 --> 02:27:28,313
You!

1334
02:27:28,313 --> 02:27:32,132
I am taking back what you stole.

1335
02:27:34,792 --> 02:27:40,378
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf!

1336
02:27:41,196 --> 02:27:46,040
I laid low your warriors of old.

1337
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:50,577
I instill terror in the hearts of men.

1338
02:27:51,799 --> 02:27:57,194
I am King... under the mountain.

1339
02:27:57,646 --> 02:28:02,045
This is not your kingdom. These are Dwarf lands...

1340
02:28:02,817 --> 02:28:05,085
This is Dwarf gold.

1341
02:28:06,243 --> 02:28:10,532
And we will have... our revenge.

1342
02:29:30,241 --> 02:29:35,124
Ah, revenge! Revenge!

1343
02:29:35,932 --> 02:29:41,246
I will show revenge!

1344
02:30:17,421 --> 02:30:18,789
Listen to me!

1345
02:30:18,989 --> 02:30:21,197
Do you not know what is coming?

1346
02:30:23,693 --> 02:30:27,766
I am fire.

1347
02:30:28,647 --> 02:30:31,783
I... am...

1348
02:30:33,365 --> 02:30:34,633
Death!

1349
02:30:43,405 --> 02:30:45,538
What have we done!

1350
02:30:46,861 --> 02:30:50,443
