1
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,099
Raquel, sensually yours.

2
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,752
I'm not telling
this story to apologize

3
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,755
or to explain the reason I left.

4
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,509
Especially because the only
people I wanted forgiveness from

5
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,469
I left behind that night.

6
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,347
When my parents
woke up the next day,

7
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,182
I wasn't there anymore.

8
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,061
Come in.

9
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,240
Sit down, kiddo.

10
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,959
What's up?

11
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,838
I called yesterday.

12
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,799
Raquel.

13
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,761
Oh, what a surprise!
You came to see the place?

14
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,306
Yeah, I figured I could stay,

15
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,517
try it out.

16
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,353
See how things work.

17
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,693
Let me look at you.

18
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,584
Any experience?

19
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,756
Sit here, kiddo.

20
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,730
You're a pretty thing, huh...

21
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,987
It's all right, sweetie,
I'll let you stay.

22
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,615
We'll see how the month goes,

23
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,285
and then we'll get
your paperwork in order.

24
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,913
Are you going to
sign work papers?

25
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,583
Sure, so you can
receive your benefits,

26
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,128
pension, Christmas bonus,
retirement fund...

27
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,007
Just kiddin', silly.

28
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,638
The deal is simple: each
trick lasts one hour for R$100.

29
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,224
40 is yours and
60 goes to the house.

30
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,853
R$100 an hour, 40 is yours
and 60 to the house.

31
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,273
If you change your sheets
too much, you'll pay for laundry.

32
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,860
- Ok?
- Ok.

33
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,945
Let's go meet the girls.

34
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,909
Did you choose that name, Raquel?

35
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,995
It's kind of lame, get another.

36
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,955
Let's go, sweetie.

37
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,752
Look at this woman's
fake boobs.

38
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,295
They don't even move.

39
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,047
- Let me see.
- Nice

40
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,715
Look at that!

41
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,052
We work the whole day.

42
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,931
We're open from 10am to 10pm.
Sundays are off.

43
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,974
Rush hour is during the day.

44
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:43,146
Girls, she's going to replace Joyce.

45
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,567
Here you can wash your clothes,

46
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,153
get dressed, wait for a client...

47
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,491
The lockers are over
there, one for each girl.

48
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,452
Not much space,
but it's enough.

49
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,204
Thanks, honey.

50
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,794
You should all go to sleep,
tomorrow is the 10th,

51
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,921
our busiest day.

52
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,707
It always scared me spending
the night away from my home.

53
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,127
I'd want to leave in
the middle of the night.

54
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,258
Suddenly, I was somewhere
I didn't know very well,

55
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,302
sharing a room
with three call girls

56
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,554
that I'd never seen before.

57
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,235
Which class do you have today?

58
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,822
Several, mom.
It's not just one.

59
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,034
Hey folks!

60
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,995
Good morning, son.

61
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,792
Let's go to the game on Sunday?

62
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,711
Yeah, sure.

63
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,384
Be careful, you're going to
get your clothes dirty.

64
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,638
Don't worry, mom,
she's already kind of dirty.

65
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,972
Rodrigo!

66
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,247
Writing is a way of saying
what can't be said.

67
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,334
Revealing what we don't
like about ourselves.

68
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,253
Giving this to the reader
as an ugly gift,

69
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,632
that we give away
expecting nothing in return.

70
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,220
Hey, class.

71
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,682
Gabriela and Luciana
are up next week.

72
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,412
Hey, did you get my text?

73
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,539
Yeah.

74
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,416
So, let's study at
my place today?

75
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,088
I don't know. I won't
be able to stay long.

76
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,381
It won't take long.

77
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,051
It'll be quick.

78
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,360
Hi.

79
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,320
Hi, I managed to show up.

80
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,365
I'm glad you're here.
Let's go inside.

81
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,706
My room, Raquel. Raquel, my room.
Make yourself comfortable.

82
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,751
Should we study
the whole book or

83
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,545
only the last two chapters?

84
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,672
I forgot my book at school.

85
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,883
No problem, we can
study with mine.

86
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,259
No, no.

87
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,220
I want to kiss you.

88
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,891
We better study.
I can't stay for long.

89
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,685
-I should be home.
-Just a little kiss.

90
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,878
Come here.

91
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,800
- Do something for me.
- Wait.

92
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:43,613
Come on.

93
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,289
Keep going.
This is what you came for.

94
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,504
Enough! Get off!

95
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,049
You can't stop now.
You gonna leave me hanging?

96
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,093
Jerk!

97
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,846
Why don't you do
what you did to Felipe?

98
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,556
Blow me till I'm done.

99
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,476
You fucking nerd.

100
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,078
Honey, did you decide
on your school trip?

101
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,247
It's this weekend.

102
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,125
Have you talked
to your father?

103
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,421
Everyone's going.
I still need to pay.

104
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,048
Let's change
the subject, Celeste?

105
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,427
- As usual...
- As usual you fuck things up.

106
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,056
Have you thought about
studying, going to college?

107
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,058
Trying to become someone.

108
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,604
And now you're complaining,
"I'm not going on the school trip..."

109
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,480
- Rodrigo, please.
- Mom, I have to...

110
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,777
Let's change
the subject, Celeste.

111
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,711
HI, RAQUEL, CHECK MY PROFILE,
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

112
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,384
YESTERDAY, I HAD
A GREAT TIME STUDYING!

113
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,305
IF YOU WANT A STUDY PARTNER,
I RECOMMEND HER!! LOL

114
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,308
Asshole, son of a bitch.

115
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,395
- Raquel, have you...
- Can't you knock?

116
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,650
Have you seen the jewelry
your father gave me?

117
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,110
The ones from the wedding?

118
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,279
Yes, from our anniversary.

119
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,615
It must be in the closet.
That's where you keep them.

120
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,036
Raquel, are you sure
you don't know where it is?

121
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,584
No.

122
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,832
RAQUEL'S A COCKSUCKER

123
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,924
Ms. Larissa! Client!

124
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,968
No need to yell,
I see who comes in.

125
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,512
Remember, sweetie, my monitor?

126
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,765
Look who's still alive.

127
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,018
It's been a while.

128
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,271
Honey, get up there.

129
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,566
Now look what
a coincidence, Huldson.

130
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,903
A pretty little thing just arrived,

131
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,572
that you'll really like.

132
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,952
Tell us, how did you
end up in this joint?

133
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,039
'Cause you sure don't
look like a call girl.

134
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,583
If you tell me you're a virgin,
I'll believe you.

135
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,091
Ms. Larissa said
she is coming up.

136
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,425
Client or complaint?

137
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,845
It's that nice guy that
hasn't shown up in a while.

138
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,268
Girls.

139
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,355
These stairs kill me.

140
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,030
You, client.

141
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,871
Hurry up, honey.
I don't have all day.

142
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,756
Girls, fix yourselves up,
you're looking worn out.

143
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,176
Come, sweetie, get down there.

144
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,892
Hi.

145
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,105
I'm Huldson.

146
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,734
Hi, Huldson

147
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,445
What's your name?

148
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,038
Bruna.

149
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,749
What?

150
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,752
Bruna.

151
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,013
How old are you, Bruna?

152
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,767
I'm 18.

153
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,457
It's your first trick, isn't it?

154
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,044
It is, here.

155
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,597
Calm down. Relax.

156
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,977
Come here, sit down.

157
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,197
Stand up.

158
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,838
Lay down.

159
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,496
I didn't cry.

160
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,831
I didn't ask to stop.

161
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,000
I didn't run back
to my parents' house.

162
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,586
At that moment, Raquel,

163
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,880
the Raquel I once was,

164
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,716
was dead.

165
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,898
Can I leave this here to wash?

166
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,150
Leave it with the others.

167
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,245
Oh, My God!

168
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:39,625
Barbie, when you open
the tap, the shower goes cold.

169
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,379
Go wash your
undies somewhere else.

170
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,859
Hurry up in there, Janine.

171
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,949
Want a fix, cutie?

172
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,644
Let's get dressed,
we got clients.

173
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,110
Just like any otherjob,

174
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,446
the secret was knowing
how to sell yourself.

175
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,450
I'm Mel, I suck real good.

176
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,826
Hi, Mel.

177
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,412
I'm Janine, how you doing?

178
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,997
Better now.

179
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:04,251
Hi, I'm Bruna and I'll do
whatever you want.

180
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,756
At first, I didn't know
how to be sexy,

181
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,883
how to be desired.

182
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,803
I never imagined someone
would pay to be with me.

183
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,350
On the first week,
I had about 30 guys.

184
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,604
That's more than most
women fuck in their entire lives.

185
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,992
Earn 5000 Reais a month
giving massage.

186
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,286
This is what the ad said.

187
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,039
It sounded like the
easiestjob in the world,

188
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,250
but it wasn't.

189
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,418
But what I made
working there

190
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,046
was more than double
my brother's income.

191
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,257
It was more than those
preppy school girls

192
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,008
would earn with a diploma.

193
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:58,305
Girls, introductions in room 3.
Mel and Janine, go.

194
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,809
Bruna, you can rest.
Come on, girls.

195
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,770
Larissa, if you want,
I can go again.

196
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,367
If I keep this up,
how much can I earn a month?

197
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:24,582
Sweetie, a lot more than a
saleswoman behind the counter.

198
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,712
Now, please buy
some sexier outfits.

199
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,090
Those rags you wear...

200
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,034
I like this one.

201
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,827
Those are granny panties.

202
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,040
There are some
great blouses over here.

203
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,131
Let me see.

204
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,968
It looks great.

205
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,598
I don't know...

206
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,032
We beat you 3 nil, bro.

207
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,374
That's Bruna.

208
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,223
Fuck, man, she's hot.

209
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,809
For real!

210
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,729
Hi, I'm Bruna.
Do you want to talk?

211
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,940
No, we can chat upstairs.

212
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,276
I can call the other
girls for your friend.

213
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,071
No, I want you.

214
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,864
Let's go upstairs?

215
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,783
Ok.

216
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,954
- Wait here.
- What else can I do?

217
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,625
The girls said that in the beginning
every newcomer did well.

218
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,254
But while they talked about me,
I was making a name for myself.

219
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,964
I have to confess,

220
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,093
I loved being the
most popular girl in school.

221
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,764
Oh, fuck.
Yeah, slowly...

222
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,145
That feels good.

223
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,354
-Hi.
-Hi.

224
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,564
I'm Bruna.

225
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,233
Gustavo.

226
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,944
- Let's go upstairs?
- Yep!

227
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,539
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

228
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,482
Please come back.

229
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,525
I will.

230
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,321
I will come back.

231
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,834
When you go
downstairs to pay,

232
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,923
tell them this
one is on me.

233
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,219
- Really?
- This one is on the house.

234
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,654
I'm fed up with this shit.

235
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,823
Barbie is hogging all the clients.

236
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,659
Let the girl earn her money...

237
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,537
You had your highs.
Are you jealous?

238
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,831
I'm not jealous!

239
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,125
I have a son to raise.

240
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,086
If I had money
she could have every client.

241
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,588
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

242
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,176
There's something
we don't know about her.

243
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,261
There sure is.

244
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,603
Hi, I'm Bruna.

245
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,231
I'm Rodrigo.

246
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,652
Remember?

247
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,530
Remember me, Bruna?

248
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:58,493
I'm Celeste and Mr. Otto's son,

249
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,789
that great naive couple,

250
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,877
who adopted that ugly little girl,

251
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:13,175
believing she could be someone.
And look at what she turned into,

252
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,510
a whore.

253
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,515
- You are a whore.
- What are you doing here?

254
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,268
I should ask you.
What are you doing here?

255
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,648
What are you doing here?

256
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,942
You whore.

257
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,698
My mother loves you.
Their life turned into a living hell.

258
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,327
They keep blaming
each other and here you are,

259
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,957
spreading your legs
for a hundred reais!

260
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,673
Stop it!
I'm going to scream!

261
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,720
Is it money you want?

262
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,309
Take it!

263
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,396
Now stay away
from my family.

264
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,026
I'll tear you apart,
so help me God.

265
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,448
Slut. You piece of shit.

266
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,075
Stay away.

267
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,454
Alright?

268
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,374
Bruna...

269
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,505
Whore.

270
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,877
I don't know why,
but for some reason,

271
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,213
I thought I was doing that
because I loved my parents.

272
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,091
It was never something
I did to hurt them,

273
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,970
I just wanted them to
feel something for me.

274
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,515
Longing, shame,

275
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,435
or even anger.

276
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:03,386
Hello?

277
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,765
Raquel!

278
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,227
Is that you, Raquel?

279
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,396
Raquel?

280
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,137
Hi.

281
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,185
You are not well today.

282
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,313
What's the matter?

283
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,151
Everything's ok, Hudson.

284
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:46,614
Huldson.

285
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,744
I'm a working girl.

286
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,623
If things are fine
with you, then I feel great.

287
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,501
No, I don't want
to have sex today.

288
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,379
Today I want you to smoke.

289
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,220
Go over by the window.
I want to look at you.

290
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,453
Don't look at me.

291
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,581
Can I tell you a secret?

292
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,710
Is it what I'm thinking?

293
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,675
You were my very first client.

294
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,931
Is that what you were thinking?

295
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,062
No. I thought you were
going to tell me your name.

296
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,732
You know my name.

297
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,651
It's Bruna.

298
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,155
Tell me your name, come on.

299
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,323
My name is Bruna.

300
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,996
Pour me some coffee, hon.

301
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,794
The next client is all yours.

302
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,590
It's time for
you to haul a man.

303
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,721
Let's go to my office,

304
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,640
you'll put on some perfume
and go to the reception.

305
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,393
Let's go.
Grab my cigarettes.

306
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,193
What about the diary?
Have you been writing?

307
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,736
Yeah.

308
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,030
Want a cigarette?

309
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,531
No, thanks.

310
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,462
Fuck! I can't believe it!

311
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,839
Someone stole my stuff!
Who was it?!

312
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,299
Are you nuts?

313
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:55,011
- It was you, wasn't it?
- What are you talking about?

314
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,641
- Maybe you misplaced it?
- Someone broke into my locker.

315
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,476
They took
my jewelry, my money...

316
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,353
Maybe you deserve it...

317
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,355
What do you mean,
you jealous bitch?

318
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,982
Everyone knows
who you really are.

319
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't steal from anybody.

320
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,319
- Listen up, bitch.
- Shut up!

321
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,196
I'm gonna
kick your ass.

322
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I'm not stupid.

323
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,824
- What's going on?
- Bruna's locker was broken into.

324
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,536
Everything I had was stolen.

325
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,413
- I'm going to call the cops.
- Are you insane?

326
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,873
What's going on?

327
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,168
- Janine stole my money.
- I did not.

328
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,711
Larissa, look at me.

329
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,590
I swear on my son.
I didn't steal anything.

330
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,931
She says she didn't
take it. Enough.

331
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,058
The show's over. Scatter.

332
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,310
- Who does she think she is?
- Be quiet.

333
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,316
What do you want me
to do? Let it slide?

334
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,735
I told you, Janine
has a short fuse.

335
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,488
She'll do anything for
a client, but she's not a thief.

336
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,992
Who else would want
to screw me?

337
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,629
Don't run away,
I'm talking to you.

338
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,507
- Say it!
- Say what?

339
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,717
Where's my money?

340
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,011
What money?
I didn't take anything.

341
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,137
Are you insane?

342
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,223
You're fucked if
you don't tell me.

343
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,934
Say it! Say it!

344
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,227
I didn't take anything.

345
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,187
I'll have to hurt you.

346
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,856
Where is my money?

347
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,817
Say it, bitch!
I don't want to hurt you.

348
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,490
I'm not a preppy
idiot. Tell me.

349
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,041
I'm sorry.

350
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,761
I spent it all on coke.

351
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,390
I'm pathetic. Sorry.

352
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,278
You'll pay me back.

353
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,156
I'm not an idiot.
You will pay me.

354
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,574
You hear me?

355
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,746
Fucking junkie!

356
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,009
Piss off, you wanna-be slut.

357
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,470
What are you writing?

358
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,181
A letter to my son.

359
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,268
What do you
want with me?

360
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,979
I want to apologize.

361
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,565
I'm sorry for accusing you.

362
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,818
I know it wasn't you.

363
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,569
Listen up,

364
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,198
I've starved,
couldn't send money home,

365
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,034
but I've never
stolen anything.

366
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,620
I'm apologizing.

367
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:13,000
You girls think I'm a stupid
prom queen on vacation.

368
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,046
But for me it's hard
as hell to be here too.

369
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,383
I respect all of you.

370
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,053
I want to be respected as well.

371
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,432
Alright.

372
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,822
People think call girls
work at night,

373
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,033
But the truth is we're
busier during the day.

374
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,494
I never stopped.

375
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,665
When I closed the door, I didn't
want to be just another fuck.

376
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,710
I wanted to be the
highlight of that guy's day.

377
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,379
I didn't discriminate.

378
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,423
Call girls don't choose.

379
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,550
I treated everyone well,

380
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,719
I guess that was my secret.

381
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,221
Sometimes, knowing that
a client wanted me,

382
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,640
was worth more than the money.

383
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,271
It was weird thinking
that while they were there,

384
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,357
their wives were at work
or cooking at home.

385
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,402
But even this became
a subject in bed.

386
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:26,407
Each of them was a trip,
another story for me to tell.

387
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,036
There was a guy who liked
to show me how big he was.

388
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,872
Biggest one you
ever seen, right?

389
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,836
Another one paid to
move furniture around.

390
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,923
Now... the bed goes over there!

391
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,510
It was all he could do, poor guy.

392
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,514
- Is it good over here?
- I want to look out that way.

393
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,058
Put the stool on that side.

394
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,810
It will look great!

395
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,524
But the funniest
client, was Mr. Powder.

396
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,275
Go on up, dear.

397
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,154
He almost poisoned us
with all that baby powder.

398
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,410
Hey, Janine, Powder digs you.

399
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,206
There were many strange guys,

400
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,167
but for some reason,
I pleased them all.

401
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,420
Seven out of ten guys
wanted Bruna.

402
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,721
Bruna,

403
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:36,185
now that you're experienced,
tell us, what do men like?

404
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,105
Every man likes something different.

405
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,274
Men like to make women cum.

406
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,945
If you moan just right,
even if you fake it, they go crazy.

407
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,739
If the guy realizes you're
doing it for money,

408
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,366
he's not coming back.

409
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,243
- Right, Janine?
- Moan for us.

410
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,371
Moan so that we
can hear Barbie moaning.

411
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,665
Let's find out how
you get so many clients.

412
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,877
Moan! I want to see
if you're a professional.

413
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,588
- Moan, goddamnit.
- Moan, come on. It's easy.

414
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,178
Sometimes you take in
a breath, like this...

415
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,642
Stop it.

416
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,777
Moan, girl!

417
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,907
Could you tone it down a bit,
the customers are complaining.

418
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,826
The customers?
And what are we?

419
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,331
I'm asking with all due
respect for you to keep it down.

420
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,207
I'm not keeping it down.

421
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,752
I'm a customer and
I'll talk the way I want.

422
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,379
I think you're losing
your temper for nothing.

423
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,882
Be honest, you don't
serve prostitutes here.

424
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,176
Madam, if you keep
screaming I'll call security.

425
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,970
I'm not a
fucking madam. I'm leaving.

426
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,849
Take your hands off me.
Let's go, girls, we're leaving.

427
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,353
You got a problem?

428
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,772
- How much do I owe you?
- You don't have to pay.

429
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:07,401
I'm going to pay.
Listen up, ladies,

430
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,487
while you complain
about other people's lives,

431
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,156
we have an appointment
with your husbands.

432
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:18,162
If you want to learn something,
here's my business card.

433
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,167
This is bullshit.
Go fuck yourselves.

434
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,004
What was that?

435
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,507
Screw your customers!

436
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,176
Leave it over there.

437
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,346
My nails look terrible.

438
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,556
Why did you pay?

439
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,976
Why did you waste
all that money?

440
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,565
Shit.

441
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,233
Here.

442
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,528
It didn't smear that much.

443
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,533
I was watching you
on the dance floor...

444
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,243
You rocked, girl.

445
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,081
What's your name?

446
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,208
Bruna.

447
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,087
Pleasure. I'm Carol.

448
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:40,971
I'm with friends in the VIP area
that would love to meet you.

449
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,556
VIP area?

450
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:50,606
Guys, this is Bruna.

451
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,985
Nice to meet you, Bruna.

452
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,403
How are you?

453
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,293
Never seen you here
before, Bruna. First time?

454
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,630
What do you work with, Bruna?

455
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,841
Sex.

456
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,142
I want to talk
with my friend.

457
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,771
We're waiting for
you outside. Let's go?

458
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,066
Hey, Bruna.

459
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:39,822
Give me a call,
I'd love to see you again.

460
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,576
Here's something for
you to remember me by.

461
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,743
We're leaving.

462
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,581
Bye. You better go
cause she's stressed out.

463
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,573
Oh, fuck. Turn it off.

464
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,700
Shit, the cops.

465
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:29,663
My registration's expired,
everything is fucked.

466
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,167
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

467
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,085
License, please.

468
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,963
Just a second.

469
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,637
Damn it. I left it at home.
Everything is in my other purse.

470
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,722
At least give me the
vehicle's registration.

471
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,474
I left it all there, man.

472
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,809
I'll have to seize your
vehicle and your license.

473
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,729
Let it slide, man.
There are only women here.

474
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,564
"Let it slide?"

475
00:53:55,815 --> 00:54:00,319
Officer, can I have
a quick word with you?

476
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,238
A quick word?

477
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,952
What's she going to do?

478
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,463
I can't believe it.

479
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,174
Look!

480
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,806
I'm shocked.

481
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,855
My God!

482
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,902
He fell for it.

483
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,881
Barbie scored the cop.

484
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,310
Our princess had a quickie.
You go, girl.

485
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,395
We're good to go.

486
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,441
Me and my girlfriend,
Were holding each other tight,

487
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,944
She turns to me and says,
Would some wine be alright?

488
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,281
Next thing I know,
She has lost her mind,

489
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:31,702
Now everyone is lookin'
At my princess' behind!

490
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:35,372
She's a goner, dancin' crazy,
Movin' across the floor,

491
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,667
I'm standin' here like a fool,
Tryin' hard to ignore,

492
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,962
But she keeps gettin' down and dirty,
Shakin' it from bottom to top,

493
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,758
She goes up, she gets down,
My princess just can't stop!

494
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,593
She goes up, she gets down...

495
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,183
Oh, God... My head.

496
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,644
Jesus, major hangover...

497
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,857
I think I'm still drunk.

498
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,658
What's gotten into you?
Are you deaf?

499
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,621
I'm ringing the damn bell
and no one showed up.

500
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,168
And what about this dirty table?

501
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,669
Kelly!

502
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,927
Got wasted last night, huh?

503
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:36,141
Whoever's not ready in
five minutes is getting fined.

504
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,065
What about sleeping beauty?
Where is she?

505
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,443
Jesus Christ.

506
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,622
There are no clean sheets.

507
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,501
There's nothing I can do.
The laundry isn't back yet.

508
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,754
You expect me to
work on cum-stained sheets?

509
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,174
Turn them over.

510
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:14,596
You've slept more than worked,
so they can't be that stained.

511
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,098
Alright then.

512
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,726
When the next client arrives,
I'll fuck him on the floor.

513
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,356
You're starting to
piss me off, you little bitch.

514
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,985
Punk.

515
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,826
How much longer, Carol?

516
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,246
At least another 45 minutes.

517
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,832
- 45!?
- Of course!

518
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,173
I have to be careful
not to get ugly again.

519
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,176
Don't get paranoid, sugar.
You look great.

520
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,846
By the way, Miguel called me.
He spoke highly of you.

521
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,808
I'm going to introduce
you to some high rollers.

522
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,936
Just like your sugar daddy,
with an allowance every month?

523
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,399
Soon you'll score a man who'll
pay for your vacation, benefits...

524
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,943
and then, life will be much easier.

525
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,820
Don't even say it.

526
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,365
I ran away so that I
wouldn't depend on anyone.

527
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,165
Now, honestly,
that friend of yours Gabi...

528
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,002
just won't do. She's cheap.
She's too ghetto.

529
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:30,130
You're at another level.

530
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,276
- I'm playing for keeps.
- You're picking up all my cards.

531
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:54,571
I'm playing for real.
I want to win this cash.

532
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:10,003
Listen up, girls.
I want everyone's attention.

533
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:19,846
If you want to fuck up
your nose snorting, go ahead.

534
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,849
But not in my place.

535
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,395
I want to know whose this is.

536
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,731
Who owns this crap?

537
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,235
There's a bunch of girls
out there looking for work.

538
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:39,533
Plenty of hot,
beautiful college-girls!

539
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,076
Spill it, Kelly.

540
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,831
If you don't, you'll be the
first one out on the street.

541
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:51,253
Leave her out of this.
I admit it. It's all mine.

542
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,047
I don't care.

543
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,597
It's all mine, Larissa.

544
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,935
News flash.

545
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:16,069
Both of you, pack
your things and get out.

546
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,030
Do you hear me?

547
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:23,452
Now! 1 , 2, 3, out!

548
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,922
Fucking bitch.

549
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,021
For what the building offers,
the price is excellent.

550
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,607
- Yes, it really is.
- It's pricey, though.

551
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,320
Services like parking and
rec area are included.

552
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,072
Everything's included.

553
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,408
I don't think
we need a place this big.

554
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:07,829
A flat like this doesn't cost as
much as a hellhole in the ghetto.

555
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:11,833
These stairs lead to the suite.
Lavatory, kitchen, terrace.

556
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,548
Carol was my ticket to
the world of VIP clients.

557
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,635
Gabi, my partner, was with me.

558
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,845
They were my only friends,

559
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:29,184
but back then I was more
concerned with money than friendship.

560
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,983
I'm afraid we're
risking too much.

561
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:41,446
Gabi, some call girls earn more
than doctors or lawyers.

562
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,990
If all else fails, the worst
that can happen to you

563
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,785
is going back
to turning tricks.

564
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,497
You know that
I'm looking for another gig.

565
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,875
I wanna work in fashion
and never turn tricks again.

566
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,587
Did you manage to get my things?

567
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,008
At least now I have clothes.

568
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:06,346
Guess what happened?

569
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,057
Larissa is pissed.

570
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:13,645
Clients keep asking for Bruna,
who looks like a surfer girl.

571
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:18,316
Now she understands
who kept that place going.

572
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,407
That's it, Gabi, of course.

573
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,533
What?

574
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,745

A PEEP INTO THE DIARY
OF BRUNA SURFER GIRL.

581
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,783
Every day we'll post
a different picture.

582
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,957
I TOOK SOME HOT PICTURES,
I'LL POST A NEW ONE EVERYDAY.

583
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:15,517
Bruna Surfer Girl.

584
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,773
Hold on. Let me
check my schedule.

585
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,777
Gabi, I'll do anything, ok?

586
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,113
Let me see...

587
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,950
Tomorrow at noon
is great. Fine then.

588
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,745
It's scheduled.

589
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,272
Come in.

590
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,692
Huldson.

591
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,444
Hi.

592
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,865
Welcome to Surfer Girl's place.

593
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,910
Wow, very nice.

594
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,829
- Like it?
- Look at this...

595
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,167
You made a huge investment,
Bruna Surfer Girl.

596
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,380
And you thought that
I wouldn't make it there.

597
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,134
Make it where exactly?

598
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,180
I set up the
computer you gave me.

599
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,307
I noticed.

600
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,312
- Let's go see my room.
- Yeah.

601
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,358
Master suite.
You'll love it.

BRUNA, I LOVE READING ABOUT
YOUR ROUTINE, TELL ME MORE...

605
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:50,505
BRUNA, YOU'RE INCREDIBLY HOT.
I ENJOYED OUR CHAT. LOL

606
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,590
ARE YOU A REAL CALL GIRL?
I LOVE YOU S2S!!

607
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,594
Right away, I realized that
the blog would set me apart.

608
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,265
I didn't make up
anything, that was my life.

609
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,727
And everyone was
curious about a call girl's life.

610
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,982
YESTERDAY WAS A BUSY DAY,
A LOT HAPPENED...

611
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,152
THE 1 ST ONE ALMOST COULDN'T MAKE IT,
BUT I WARMED HIM UP.

612
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,528
I realized that besides
fooling around,

613
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,489
guys loved to talk
about their problems.

614
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,907
And I liked to listen.

615
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,702
- Where do you work?
- In a bank.

616
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,954
A bank! What do you do?

617
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,749
- I'm an business man.
- 9 to 5?

618
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,424
My darling.

619
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,217
She's so cute!

620
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,597
She is so smart!

621
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,350
- You're so proud, aren't you?
- She's going places.

622
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,728
To this day I don't know
what my profession is.

623
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:52,859
I took a public service exam.
I start at 8am, leave at 6pm.

624
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,529
No one talks to each other.
I stare at the computer...

625
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,406
I was the perfect woman.

626
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,910
I was there to fuck,
listen and never complain.

627
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,957
My wife doesn't help either.
She only worries about the dogs.

628
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,710
Cocker Spaniel this, Poodle that.

629
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,504
YOUR BLOG IS VERY NICE.
I WANT TO SEE YOUR FLAT.

630
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,838
I CAN'T WAIT TO BANG YOU AGAIN.

631
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,173
YOU'RE AWESOME! SO HOT!

632
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,341
WHERE IS YOUR FLAT?

633
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,425
LET'S GO TO A SWING CLUB
ON FRIDAY?

634
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,260
Whoever had Bruna Surfer Girl

635
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,137
always wanted more.

636
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,764
What I didn't expect

637
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,934
was to become the most
famous call girl in Brazil.

638
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,813
Not bad for someone
who had low self-esteem.

639
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,567
You're really hot.

640
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,822
I'm not the same
Bruna you met at the club.

641
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,533
Now I'm a different Bruna...

642
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,618
Bruna Surfer Girl.

643
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,916
It's the money.

644
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,938
So, Bruna, if you had
to give me a score,

645
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,107
what score would it be?

646
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,985
What do you mean a score?

647
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,445
A score from 0 to 10?

648
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,906
It doesn't need to be
a standard score.

649
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:26,870
It could be some kind of rating:

650
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:33,793
Good, hot, excellent,
incredible, loser, limp dick.

651
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,297
Let me think...

652
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,133
Excellent!

653
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:53,146
NEWS FLASH!! FROM NOW ON
SURFER GIRL WILL RATE HER CLIENTS.

654
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,357
3RD ROUND: BUSINESS MAN,
40 YEARS OLD. SOPHISTICATED.

655
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,110
TOOK A WHILE TO WARM HIM UP...

656
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:05,658
BUT THEN HE NAILED ME.
RATING:

657
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,704
The ranking idea made
the blog even more popular.

658
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,249
I'd do 25 to 30 dates a week,

659
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,501
an average of 5, 6 dates a day,

660
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,213
which meant
a lot of money. In cash.

661
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,056
I thought you
weren't coming.

662
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,558
4TH ROUND: SINGLE MAN.
KINKY BALD GUY.

663
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,269
HE WAS VERY HORNY.
HE TOOK FOREVER TO CUM

664
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,021
NICE TIP.

665
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,024
It took me 6 months to get
enough money to bang you.

666
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,359
6 months?

667
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:46,449
2ND ROUD: MARRIED MAN. VERY KIND.
HE CAME 3 TIMES. RATING:

668
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,953
I never thought
thatjob was wrong

669
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,246
or dirty.

670
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,582
Men don't consider being
with a call girl, cheating,

671
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:58,044
and they go home
much more excited.

672
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,338
RATE

673
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,966
NEW COMMENTS

674
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,223
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

675
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,766
My wife!

676
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,437
Tell her you're at the airport.

677
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:21,317
Hi, babe, miss you.

678
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,573
Just a couple more.

679
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,951
Hold your breath
and it'll work better.

680
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,248
That's it, cutie.

681
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,084
Give this baby
some tea, cause I like it.

682
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,214
Drink it all.

683
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,466
I don't think of myself as
home-wrecker,

684
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:49,762
Bruna Surfer Girl
saved a lot of marriages.

685
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,557
Just a sec,
Little Bruna is coming.

686
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,874
Living the high life, girl.

687
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,595
Turn the volume down.

688
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,187
Bruna Surfer Girl.

689
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,982
It's your boyfriend.

690
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,445
Hi, handsome.

691
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,614
I read your blog.

692
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,326
I saw what you posted
about your fabulous clients.

693
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,954
They think the world of you.
I'm pissed off.

694
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:01,042
I can't believe
you'd be jealous, Huldson.

695
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:05,505
I want compensation
for all this debauchery.

696
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:11,928
You and me.
Dinner. At a restaurant.

697
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:13,846
There's a place
I want to take you.

698
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:17,350
- I charge for outcalls.
- You can charge me.

699
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,478
Outcalls are twice the price.

700
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,854
Think about it.

701
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:27,318
Your professionalism and
the vulgarity of your blog...

702
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,655
You can't imagine
how horny that makes me.

703
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,912
Follow me, please.

704
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,961
Make yourselves comfortable
and have a nice dinner.

705
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,629
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

706
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,720
So, do you like it?

707
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,515
This place is amazing.

708
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:01,310
And to think no client
had ever asked me to dinner.

709
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,690
That's because you don't
accept the good things.

710
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:15,158
Yet you keep finding me special?

711
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,498
Listen, Bruna,
or whatever your name is.

712
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:29,881
I know that somewhere inside
you lives an amazing person

713
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,217
that you killed off
for some reason.

714
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,220
And I want to find out why.

715
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,231
I brought you something.

716
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,580
Stop playing this role.

717
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,930
I don't deserve this.

718
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,266
It's yours.

719
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,823
Hi, Gabi.

720
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:43,704
I'm on a date,
tell them to wait.

721
01:15:53,799 --> 01:16:01,055
It's gorgeous,
but I prefer my double pay.

722
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,599
Fine.

723
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:04,976
Alright.

724
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:06,811
Now,

725
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:13,150
remember when you're
fucking those guys,

726
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:17,113
remember very well
the life you chose.

727
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,161
I hope you have a lot of fun.

728
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,498
Ok. It's scheduled.

729
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:32,503
Do you have any
fetishes in particular

730
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,964
a fantasy, something?

731
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,676
Sure. That's what we're here for.

732
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,431
Hold on a sec.

733
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,518
Hello? Who?

734
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,523
Fucking hell!

735
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,485
Wake up.

736
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,903
Client!

737
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,741
- Wake up, Bruna.
- I'm sleeping.

738
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,909
Get up.

739
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,662
I'm sleeping, god damnit.

740
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,249
Let's go, let's go.

741
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:18,049
I had a dinner yesterday,
a bachelor party with 8 guys...

742
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,384
It's our fourth
cancellation this week!

743
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,386
Soon we won't
have any clients left.

744
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,516
Who gets fucked
to support this shit?

745
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,728
Want to trade?

746
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,028
Now she is rating the guys.

747
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:42,823
- Look at this picture.
- She looks gorgeous.

748
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,829
I started blogging about my clients,

749
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,540
but after awhile I became
the main subject.

750
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,293
- Bruna, I want to interview you.
- You are so hot!.

751
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,213
- How much for the whole night?
- Write some tips on your blog.

752
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:00,091
- Bruna, do you do DP?
- I'm horny!

753
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,635
- Show me your boobs.
- Slut!

754
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,179
- I love you, marry me!
- I want to go to your party.

755
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:07,807
Do you really surf?

756
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,769
My webpage had more than
10 thousand views a day.

757
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,271
I became a hit on the web.

758
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,234
And I finally understood why
people want to become celebrities.

759
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:21,654
It's not for the fame,
but to be loved.

760
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:38,379
Great. Everything is perfect.

761
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,593
There's only one
Bruna Surfer girl.

762
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,512
She's lucky, honey.

763
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,514
You're jealous.

764
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,349
You gotta pay
to have a piece of this.

765
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,521
Don't forget to thank them.
Thanking is classy. Ok?

766
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,940
I'm starting to get anxious.

767
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:01,652
Our company is called
Kelly & Mel, get it?

768
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,864
kellycommel.com.br

769
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:09,243
Girls, you look gorgeous.

770
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:13,456
How is Bruna doing?

771
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,585
She is great. Very excited,
a lot of positive energy.

772
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:21,338
Shouldn't she make a more
discreet entrance, greet people...

773
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:24,967
No way, sugar.
You're narrow minded...

774
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,763
We still have a surprise
at the end. I'll handle it.

775
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,239
Goddess!

776
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,450
You are so hot!

777
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,578
Bruna, I love you.

778
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:57,374
Good evening.

779
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:04,048
What a beautiful, sexy,
and horny crowd.

780
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,719
I'm very happy to be here,

781
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:12,473
at this party that
my friend Carol threw for me.

782
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,186
It's a dream I was
able to accomplish,

783
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,356
because I never stopped
believing in what I wanted.

784
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:25,611
That's why you have to
fight for what you believe in.

785
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,822
You can be someone as well.

786
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,657
That's it.

787
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,784
That's always it.

788
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:36,205
Now I'm going to
call a friend of mine,

789
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,750
my friend Carol,
who put this party together.

790
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,753
We have a little surprise for you.

791
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,050
Happy birthday, girl.

792
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,970
I have one thing to say.

793
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:55,140
Here at my best friend's Birthday,

794
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,477
You're the ones
who get the presents!

795
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:03,232
Bruna Surfer Girl is
yours tonight for free.

796
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:06,026
Listen, everyone, get in line.

797
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,280
Calm down, people.

798
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,116
Here is your number.

799
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,869
Do you have a number?

800
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,759
Quit it, Gabi.
Ghetto insecurity.

801
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:37,016
Wake up, don't you get it?
I'm Bruna. Bruna Surfer Girl.

802
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:41,645
You can go to
any table, talk to any guy.

803
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,106
Everyone wants to fuck me.

804
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,566
Go on.

805
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,860
Do you doubt me?
Choose one...

806
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,154
Cut the bullshit.

807
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,574
You're spending too much,
snorting like crazy.

808
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:57,119
If you want to keep this up,
I'd rather you call your girlfriend,

809
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,747
whose only concern
is her own line of coke.

810
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,208
Carol, your problem is Carol.

811
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,795
What is it?
Are you jealous of Carol?

812
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,881
Or maybe you envy her?

813
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,382
Envy?!

814
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:13,636
Envious of a bloodsucker
who depends on a geezer?

815
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,097
I prefer to open my legs
for 20 bucks.

816
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,307
So that's it.

817
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:22,645
Carol does herjob, you do
yours and stop bothering me.

818
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:27,942
If you don't want it,
quit, it won't matter to me.

819
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:37,451
That's what I'll do.

820
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,911
I'm leaving.

821
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:44,917
This way, both of you can
fuck up the rest of your life.

822
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:48,087
Don't overdo it. Come on.

823
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,299
You're the one overdoing it
and you don't even realize it.

824
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,550
By the way,

825
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,722
don't forget to pay these bills

826
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,642
for that fancy party
Carol threw for you.

827
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,790
Your time is over.

828
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,253
Do you hear me.
Your time is over.

829
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,382
Let me go.

830
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:34,675
Your time is over.

831
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,803
-Let me go. You had your time.
-Are you nuts?

832
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:39,138
What?

833
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,517
I'll make a good rating
of you on my blog.

834
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,729
I thought you were a pro.

835
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,064
Surfer.

836
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,362
Here.

837
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,323
You're not good at all.

838
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:02,119
Bruna?

839
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,081
Bruna.

840
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,713
Hey, I need a break, alright?

841
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,549
I'm going to drink some
water and then we'll start.

842
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:23,390
Today I'm talking
to Bruna Surfer girl.

843
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,894
Bruna, how did it
feel to be awarded

844
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,771
for the top blog of the year.

845
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:32,691
Did you imagine that
your blog was this popular?

846
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,444
I don't know if this much.

847
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,821
Did success change your routine?

848
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:41,950
What are you going
to do after this interview?

849
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,207
I'll wait for my clients
as I always do.

850
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:51,251
I want to thank
everyone who nailed me.

851
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:55,506
My fee is the same and I haven't
stopped because I'm famous.

852
01:24:55,715 --> 01:25:02,554
If you want to fuck me, visit
my blog at brunasurfergirl.com.

853
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,348
What else?

854
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,269
Bruna.

855
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,355
Come in.

856
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:57,234
Excuse me.
I scheduled with Gabi.

857
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,865
Gabi doesn't work here anymore.

858
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,827
I booked a time with her.

859
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,832
I looked for you
everywhere, babe.

860
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,502
I went to where you worked,
but they didn't know about you.

861
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:19,214
There are a few new girls
over there, nothing interesting.

862
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:23,886
Haven't you heard
about the internet?

863
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:27,681
Blog, Bruna Surfer Girl's blog?

864
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,687
Nice place. You have
a pool, you can sunbathe.

865
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,608
So?

866
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,862
Are we fucking or do you
intend to keep up this little chat?

867
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,993
300 Reais.

868
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,748
This is entertainment.
I don't work with charity.

869
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:54,708
I see.

870
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:01,506
Sorry, my bad,
I think I got it all wrong...

871
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,801
This isn't what I expected...

872
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:13,060
TODAY I TOOK THE DAY OFF. AFTER ALL,
SURFER GIRL NEEDS TO REST.

873
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:18,774
COME BY TOMORROW.
SHOW UP, I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

874
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:37,334
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CUT THE PRICE.
I'LL BRING SOME FRIENDS.

875
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,456
Cut me a line.

876
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:19,042
- Sorry?
- Cut me a line.

877
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,129
Didn't you sleep last night?

878
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,674
- Half and half, right?
- This is mine.

879
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,678
This doesn't even cover
half of what you owe me.

880
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,390
So take more then half.
Leave some for me.

881
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:39,688
Take care. Call me.

882
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:15,098
- I'm going to take these.
- Just a second, please.

883
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,643
I'm going to grab
some beer inside.

884
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,520
-Can have some beer?
-Sure.

885
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,731
What is your code?

886
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,779
- I'll pay for these with the gas.
- Ok.

887
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,618
I'm taking these.

888
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,268
Carol.

889
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:30,358
Carol, open the door.
I know you're in there.

890
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,862
Open this fucking door.
I swear I'll pay you.

891
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,442
MEU PAI!

892
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:59,614
- Lady, which number is up?
- Number 22.

893
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:27,058
They told me this girl is hot.

894
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:38,528
Line up, boys.

895
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,240
It's gonna be a long day.

896
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,247
Come on.

897
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:33,416
Next!

898
01:34:59,735 --> 01:35:03,530
Someone help me,
she passed out.

899
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:05,990
Someone help.

900
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,824
Emergency room number 2.

901
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:28,323
You'll be fine.

902
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,994
What are you doing here?

903
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:37,373
I brought you some clothes.

904
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:43,880
What happened?

905
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,970
I'm tired.

906
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:07,779
I'm spending
New Year's at the beach.

907
01:37:08,447 --> 01:37:09,739
Do you want to come?

908
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:23,127
I really want you
to change your life.

909
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,675
I want to be with you.

910
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,220
I've got everything.

911
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:35,974
You don't have to worry.

912
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:40,353
You can go back to your studies,

913
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:43,523
graduate high school,

914
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,442
study psychology...

915
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,653
- Stop the car.
- What?

916
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:50,822
Please, stop the car.

917
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:35,533
You are very sweet,
you know that?

918
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,621
I just wish you
could understand me.

919
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,585
I left my parents' house,
so I wouldn't depend on anyone.

920
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,963
So I could have
my own life.

921
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:02,936
Raquel.

922
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:09,692
My name...

923
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,696
My name is Raquel.

924
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,690
Sometimes I miss my old life,

925
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:52,318
my dad, my mom,

926
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:54,696
I even miss my house.

927
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,450
I think I miss the
family I wanted to have

928
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:01,661
more than the family I had.

929
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,959
I'm proud of myself,

930
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,169
I met all kinds of people.

931
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:13,131
I allowed myself
to be another person.

932
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:16,634
I also made bad choices.
But if it wasn't this way,

933
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:20,680
I'd never learn to love
myself for who I am.

934
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:25,351
That's why I'm telling this story,

935
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,645
so I'll never forget it.

936
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:31,733
It was as a call girl that
I truly found myself.

937
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:34,736
I learned a lot of things.

938
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:38,114
Maybe if I never
left my parents' house,

939
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,658
my relationship with them
would have gone back to normal.

940
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:44,245
Bruna wouldn't
have existed, only Raquel.

941
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:48,791
Only Bruna could reach
this conclusion, not Raquel.

942
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,837
I'll stop turning tricks.

943
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,133
I want to marry and
have children like everybody else.

944
01:40:57,509 --> 01:41:00,386
Before I do that, I need to save
enough money to live comfortably.

945
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:03,347
I'll work for another 6 months,

946
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,642
it'll be about 700, 800 dates.

947
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:10,063
If I ever leave this life,

948
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,857
I want to leave it
the same way I started,

949
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:15,526
accepting that it was my choice.

950
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:17,403
Come in.

951
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:29,040
After 6 months,
Raquel stopped turning tricks.

952
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:36,339
She wrote the book "The Scorpion's sweet venom",
that sold more than 250 thousand copies in Brazil
and was translated into 1 5 languages.

953
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:41,844
Today Raquel lives with an ex-client.

954
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:49,685
She never talked
to her parents again.
