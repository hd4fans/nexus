00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,261
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}NOGRADY: Today really
marks the first stage

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,719
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}of an unprecedented
technological advancement.

3
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,061
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,851
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,144
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}as we have with ours.

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,106
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}If a planet's too far away
from its sun, it's too cold.

7
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,861
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,114
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.

9
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,787
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,958
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,712
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}that is the right distance
from its star to hold water

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,711
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,795
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,600
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,895
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,230
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,482
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,610
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,532
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,248
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

21
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,582
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Start transmission.

22
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,063
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}JACKIE: Lt seems as though
NASA is setting up shop

23
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,947
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}right here in
our own backyard.

24
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,155
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.

25
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,282
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Satellite dishes
here on Oahu

26
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,490
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}sending out very powerful
signals into deep space

27
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,870
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}with an attempt to
communicate with anyone...

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,497
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}STONE: Another round,
birthday boy.

29
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,294
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}JACKIE: ...or anything that
might be out there listening.

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,705
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}A toast.

31
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,131
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Happy birthday,
little brother.

32
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,631
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,258
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}May this be
a great year for you.

34
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,805
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It's going to
be a great year.

35
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,929
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I love you.
I love you, too.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,896
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,228
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,851
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Johnny.

39
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,237
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}"Adversity is
the state in which man

40
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,656
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself

41
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,327
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}"being especially free
of admirers then."

42
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,654
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Cheers.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,822
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,077
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a very
good quote for you.

45
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,785
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,085
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,458
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,963
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you get me that?

49
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,460
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I got you that.

50
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,966
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you,
that's very sweet.

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,509
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

52
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,100
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I got this guy, Tony. He said he
can get you a construction job.

53
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,427
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}All you need to
do is call him.

54
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,187
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

55
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,439
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,728
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}STONE: You're not going
to call him, are you'?

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,526
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

58
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,479
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}or Tony's help,
for that matter.

59
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,194
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,693
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}No.
Great. All right.

61
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,284
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Happy birthday. Blow out
your candle and make a wish.

62
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,125
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Do not waste
a wish on a girl.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,294
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Wish for a job,
an apartment.

64
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,917
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.

65
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,374
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}A job, or...
You said "job" twice.

66
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,048
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,970
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}All right?

68
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,969
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Please don't waste it.

69
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,265
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

70
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,345
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going in.
You're not going in.

71
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,771
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}How do I look?

72
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,689
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait, let me
just fix that.

73
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,933
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Awesome!

74
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,393
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, princess,
go get 'em.

75
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,653
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Great start.

76
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,657
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Ugh.

77
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,078
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}What seems to
be the problem?

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,243
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,454
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Johnny, chicken burrito her.

80
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,335
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}BARTENDER: Lt ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.

81
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,758
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

82
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,089
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your name?

83
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,674
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm hungry-

84
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,055
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}That's not your name.

85
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,852
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}If you give me five minutes

86

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I will get you
your chicken burrito.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I was.

365
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,773
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I was actually talking
about you, Nagata.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I began to fall.

00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,939
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Did he just say

Just a little bit more.

482
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,259
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}And half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}We are going

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}No, we are not.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}My dog, Mustard,
could climb this mountain.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Great, you and Mustard can go and

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Mustard's dead. Mustard
got hit by a dump truck.

00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,241
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Dr. Nogrady.

00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,326
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Correct.

00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,829

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}NASA have called us. They're

541
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,857
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.

00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,950
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.

543
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,952
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, we have checked. It's not the
Russians, it's not the Chinese.

544
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,328
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe we should
call the Air Force,

545
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,122
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}because they might want
to fuel up their jets.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}but other places

00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,577
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It appears that it originated

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You have 15 seconds. Go.

970
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,503
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, sir,
I put the helmet on,

971
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,710
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.

972
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,504
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,

973
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,839
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.

974
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,971
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.

975
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:16,020
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}She went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.

976
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,306
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You see? I don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.

977
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,771
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You try anything else on?

978
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,732
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Negative, sir.

979
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,113
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Just the helmet.
Just the helmet.

980
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,697
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Scientists have confirmed

982
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:34,993
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Today I want to update
the American people

983
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,916
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}on what we know about
the situation in Hawaii.

984
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,331
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}First, we are bringing all

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}What's Landsat 7?

1002
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,481
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It's our deep-space satellite.

01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,651
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It only orbits into range

01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,678
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}What we know right now

way to track them, correct?

1016
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,062
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.

1017
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,477
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Why?
Because we are still alive.

1018
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,904
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.

1019
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,156
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}And we have no way to hit
them from a safe distance.

1020
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,743
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}There is a way.
A way?

1021
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,571
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}A way of seeing them,

1024
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,327
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Move like water?

1025
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,666
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Because I've read that thing six times.

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}That book is Chinese.

1027
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,751
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}It still makes no sense.

1028
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,428
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}My way is much more simple.

1035
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,106
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}We hack into their
transmissions, form a grid.

1036
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,899
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't track
anything without radar.

1037
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,825
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't need radar.

1038
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,195
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Just the radio frequencies.

1452
01:59:54,145 --> 01:59:56,489
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I saved the world.

1453
01:59:57,148 --> 02:00:00,823
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.

1454
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:05,449
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}But...
No means no, Hopper.

1455
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,788
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.

1456
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:11,622
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I think I will have
a chicken burrito.

1457
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:14,465
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Chicken...

1458
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:16,797
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir.

1459
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:21,215
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Come along, Hopper.

1460
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:23,925
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}We will discuss the terms
of your surrender over a meal.

1461
02:00:26,136 --> 02:00:27,308
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.

1462
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:30,974
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}She told you about that?

1463
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,820
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}You got nothing on Jay-Z.

1464
02:09:42,733 --> 02:09:44,201
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, even I
couldn't get Beyoncé.

1465
02:09:44,277 --> 02:09:45,654
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}I couldn't get
Beyoncé either.

1466
02:09:45,736 --> 02:09:46,862
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}No way.

1467
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:48,614
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Whoa.

1468
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:50,866
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}What the...

1469
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,668
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}THOM: What is that?

1470
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:01,298
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't get too close to it.

1471
02:10:01,377 --> 02:10:04,756
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Whoa, guys! Look at this!

THOM: Don't run to it.

1473
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:08,809
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you think that looks like a door?
ANGUS: A door?

1474
02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:10,636
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello?
Anyone home?

1475
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:12,938
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}ANGUS: That's not
going to help, is it?

1476
02:10:14,432 --> 02:10:16,400
{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}This really helps.

something inside of it.

to open it, Jimmy?

02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:31,666

in, he's getting in!

{\fnCronos Pro Caption\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, Jimmy!
Whoo!
