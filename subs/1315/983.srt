后期：折翼的乌鸦儿

4
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,380
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,770
我第一天干活的时候
On-- on my first day,

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,610
就把他们在课上教的东西全忘了
I forgot everything that they taught me in those classes.

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,900
-真的吗  -是啊
-Really?  -Yeah.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,290
第一天总会有点棘手
I mean, day one's always a little tough.

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,570
你也知道  不管当时训练进行如何
It's like, you know, no matter how the training goes,

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,000
最后总会有无法预料的情况
there's-- there's always room for something

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,410
会出漏子
that's just totally unpredictable.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,190
对了
Oh, I--

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,500
要是你准备好的话  我有个相当好的故事讲给你听
I've got a pretty good story for you if you're ready for it.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,170
-好啊  -早上好
-OK.  -Hey, what's up?

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,300
-早上好  -你们见过面了么
-Hey.  -Did you guys meet?

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,400
还没呢  我是奈特
No. Nate.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,190
你好
Hi.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,800
-你好  -我是杰西卡
-Hey!  -Jessica.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,050
好啦  都听我讲
OK, listen up.

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,900
当时我是第一周来上班  还是负责看门的
So it's like my first week on the job, and I'm at gate duty, right?

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,750
什么是看门的
What's that?

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,100
如果有孩子想要离开  按法律来说我们并不能阻止
If a kid wants to leave, legally we can't stop them,

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,900
所以我们安排人在门口守着尝试劝阻他们
so we put someone at the gate to try and talk them out of it.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,270
-你来得可真快  -那还用说
-Whoa, you got here quick.  -I did.

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,390
-早上好  -你好
-Good morning.  -Hi.

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,160
奈特  这是格蕾丝  她是你的新上司
Nate, this is Grace. She's your new boss.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,220
-你好  -你好
-Hello.  -Hey.

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,640
-认识你很高兴  -认识你很高兴
-Hi, nice to meet you.  -Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,650
我要是你就不会戴那条领带
I would lose the tie if I were you.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,310
而且如果你在听梅森讲故事的话
And if you're listening to a story of Mason's,

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,750
可要注意他基本都是在胡说八道
understand that there's very little reality in it.

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,660
别败了大伙的兴头好么
Hey, don't piss in the water before we put our toes in.

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,940
事实上这听起来还蛮中肯的
It actually feels pretty mellow.

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,470
好啦  所以作为我美妙的新上司
OK, so Grace, my wonderful new boss at the time,

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,730
格蕾丝当时就安排我看了三小时的门
she leaves me at my gate duty

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,660
期间还一次厕所都不给我上
for like three hours without a bathroom break.

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,040
何况我当时还吃了他们这做的玉米饼
And I'm dying because I ate the tacos

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,960
肚子疼得都快挂了
that they serve here,

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,620
而且她还没告诉我那些玉米饼是出了名的泻药
and she failed to tell me that they're a known laxative.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,710
然后一个比我还高一英寸  体型高大的
So this kid, 16 years old, this big fuckin' intimidating dude,

41
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,130
十六岁男孩朝着我走来
he's like a foot taller than me.

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,780
大摇大摆地就走出了门口
He walks up and he just cruises out the gate.

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,480
那才是我第二天上班  所以根本不知道发生了什么事情
It's my second day, so I don't know what the hell is going on.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,160
不过格蕾丝当时就站在那眼睁睁地就让他走掉了
But Grace, she's standing right there, and she just lets it happen.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,910
就听他瞎说吧
Whatever.

46
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,640
反正当时我就看到梅森就在那儿默默坐着
What I saw was Mason just sitting there

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,940
而韦斯利正从门的另外一侧对我微笑
and Wesley smiling at me from the opposite side of the gate

48
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,540
他也知道我们没有办法干涉他
because he knows that we can't touch him.

49
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,810
为什么呢
Why not?

50
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,990
他们一旦出了大门我们就没法管他们了
Once they're a foot outside the gate, we can't touch them.

51
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,600
所以格蕾丝就叫我去跟着他  我照着指示跟了几个小时
So Grace tells me to follow him, so I do for hours,

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,380
跟在他身后大概两三米
just walking eight feet behind him.

53
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,410
最后他上了一辆公交车 我也跟着上去
Eventually he gets on this bus, so I get on the bus too.

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,600
这时候我大脑一片空白  唯一能想到的是
And at this point I can't think of anything

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,110
那些玉米饼如何把我的肚子闹得天翻地覆
but whatever the hell these tacos are doing to my bowels.

56
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,360
所以我下了个决心  滚你妈的
So I make up my mind, fuck this.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,830
我下一站就一定得下车
I've got to get off at the next stop

58
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,420
不然我铁定就得在大庭广众下拉裤子了
or I'm going to lose it in my shorts in front of all these people.

59
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,550
而正巧在我作出这一决定时
And exactly as I make this decision,

60
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,680
韦斯利从过道另一侧扭过他那硕大无朋的脑袋
Wesley leans his big-ass head over to me from across the aisle,

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,320
用非常冷峻的神情对我说
and he says, really calm,

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,520
"我下一站下车  如果你再跟着我"
I'm getting off at the next stop, and if you do too,

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,500
"我他妈就把你老二揪下来然后塞回你嘴里"
I'm going to rip your fuckin' balls off and feed them to you.

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,810
我的妈呀  可别忘了我的警告
Holy shit. Remember what I said.

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,780
拜托这部分可是真的  我当时真的就在那儿
Hey now, this part is true. I was there.

66
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,720
-真的么  -恩
-Really?  -Mm-hmm.

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,780
-你真的确定  -是的
-Are you sure?  -Yeah.

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,100
然后公交车就停了  韦斯利下了车
So the bus stops. He gets off.

69
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,930
我等了一会
I wait a second.

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,830
就往车门走  但他就在车门
I go over to the door, but he's just standing there

71
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,580
几米开外的人行道上站着
on the sidewalk like 10 feet away,

72
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,420
双眼直直地盯着我  等着我下车
staring at me, waiting.

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,580
可我还能怎么办  我又没有别的办法
What can I do? I have no other choice.

74
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,980
于是我还是下了车
So I step off the bus.

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,400
而就在那瞬间我一直紧绷的肛门终于坚持不住了
And the second that my feet touch the ground,

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,610
我肚子像炸开了花儿一样
it is like a knot in my asshole untied,

77
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,780
里面的东西就顺着我的腿往下流
and the fiesta in my stomach just comes pouring down my legs.

78
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,000
于是我就站在那  由着大便在我腿上奔流
So I'm just standing there, shit gushing down my thighs.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,230
我他妈还把最爱的那双耐克给毁了
I ruined my fuckin' favorite Nikes.

80
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,120
然后韦斯利就在边上笑得头都要碰到地上了
And Wesley is just there, doubled over, losing it.

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,090
他笑起来那种阵势  他妈的我这辈子可还没见
And he's fuckin' laughing so hard. I've never seen anything--

82
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,200
-奈特快来  -等会儿  咋了
-Here we go, Nate.  -Wait, what?

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,780
-来啊奈特  -快去
-Come on, Nate!  -Go

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,340
萨米
Sammy!

85
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,560
萨米
Sammy!

86
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,080
-悠着点  -好啦好啦
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!  -Hey.

87
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,760
-我抓到他啦  -你们这些变态  他妈快放我走
-Whoa, I got him.  -Let go, you fucking perverts!

88
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,570
-好的  -奈特  麻烦帮忙抓住他的脚
-OK.  -Nate, grab his feet, please.

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,390
我们就在这草地上坐一会  等你冷静下来
Just going to sit down here in the grass for a while until you de-escalate.

90
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,890
冷静下来  你妹啊操你鸭
De-escalate my asshole, you duck fuckers!

91
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,680
我不太特别确定操你鸭是什么意思
I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,700
你也知道这种情况的  萨米  等着发作期过去就好
You know the drill, Sammy. Just let it pass.

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,950
伙计你还好吧
You all right, buddy?

94
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,150
他这次跑得还挺远  我觉得好像还破了新纪录
Whoa, he got pretty far that time. I think it's a new record.

95
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,350
所以话说回来  最后他决定跟我一起回来
So anyway, after all that he ends up coming back with me,

96
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,640
因为他实在忍不住自己去告诉大家
but only because he's so excited to tell everyone in our unit

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,880
我拉了裤子这件糗事的心情
that I pooped my pants.

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,940
而且他的确这么做了  他告诉了所有人
And he does. He tells everyone.

99
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,460
而且不知道怎么回事居然还被我妈听到了
Somehow it even got back to my mom.

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,600
萨米  你也听过这个故事对吧
You heard that story, right Sammy?

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,640
没错
Yeah.

102
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,180
-你们还好吧  -好极了
-How are you guys doing over there?  -Fantastic.

103
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,350
萨米你感觉怎样  都发泄出来了么
How are you feeling, Sammy? You got it all out?

104
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,960
想去休息下么
You want to go take a nap?

105
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,350
好  那咱们起来吧
All right, let's get you up.

106
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,470
走吧
Up we go, bud.

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,160
好啦  我们办公室见吧
All right, I'll see you back at the office.

108
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,770
-自己当心  -好吧
-Look into yourself, man.  -All right.

109
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,310
这家伙肯定是早上吃足了谷物麦片
This guy's been eating his Wheaties in the morning.

110
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,790
话说萨米你想过去参加奥运会么
Have you ever thought about the Olympics, Sammy?

111
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,550
跑跑田径赛什么的
Running track?

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
如果你想了解下这些孩子都经历过什么
These are the files on our kids, if you want to see

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,200
这里这些是关于他们的文档
what kind of crap they've been through.

114
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,720
他们在这要待多久
How long do they stay here?

115
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,380
通常来说不到一年  不过我们这有几位
Supposedly less than a year, but we have a few hat

116
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
已经待了三年多了
have been here a little over three.

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,810
在郡里面决定他们之后该怎么办之前
We just keep them

118
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,620
我们就一直在这收容他们
until the county figures out where they're going to go next.

119
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,260
汤姆
Tom!

120
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,350
快去刷牙
Go brush your teeth!

121
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,790
记住了  你既不是他们的家长也不是他们的治疗师
Remember, you are not their parent. You are not their therapist.

122
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,110
你来这唯一的目的  就是为他们提供一个安全的环境
You are here to create a safe environment, and that's it.

123
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,100
了解
Got it.

124
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,730
另外既然你是新人  他们会考验和测试你
And since you're new, they're going to try and test you,

125
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,170
看看你好不好对付
see what they can get away with.

126
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,450
所以最好暂时对他们的要求一律拒绝
So just say no for a while.

127
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,730
拒绝  好吧
No. OK.

128
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,700
在成为他们朋友前  你大概要先学会唱黑脸才行
Kind of got to be an asshole before you can be their friend.

129
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,190
不过不用紧张
You're going to be fine.

130
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,770
五分钟之后开始社区会议
Community meeting is in five minutes!

131
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,880
-路易斯  你最好乖乖起床  -可我不想
-Luis, you better be up.  -Ugh, I don't want to be.

132
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,420
所以这就是我不起床的下场么
So this is how it's going to be?

133
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,780
你有五秒钟的时间
You've got five seconds.

134
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,460
我操
Fuck!

135
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
路易斯
Luis!

136
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,260
我也爱你
I love you too.

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,250
这可一点也不好玩
It's not cool.

138
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,840
坎德拉  你愿意做今天的会议记录么
Kendra, will you be secretary for us today?

139
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,110
我想没问题吧
Sure, I guess.

140
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,800
好的  谢谢
OK, thank you.

141
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,750
社区会议现在开始
Community meeting is now in session.

142
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,040
有什么新通告么
Community announcements?

143
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,390
什么都没有吗
No announcements?

144
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,700
怎么啦  伙计们
What's going on, you guys?

145
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,370
怎么都看上去死气沉沉的
You look a little dead.

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,400
-你都把他们怎么了  -我也不知道
-What did you do to them?  -I don't know.

147
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,920
我在外面放了个屁
I farted when I was outside.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
大概是有些气体跟着我一起飘了进来
Maybe some of it followed me in.

149
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,540
所以你又拉裤子了么
Did you shart yourself again?

150
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,140
谢谢你啊路易斯  不过我没拉裤子
No, Luis, I did not shart, thank you very much.

151
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,080
而且那件事就只发生过一次  当时你都还没来这呢
And that happened one time, and you weren't even here yet, so.

152
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,330
-还是很好笑嘛  -好啦我们说完了么
-It's still funny.  -OK, are we done?

153
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,420
我今天光这故事都听三遍了
I've-- I've heard that story like three times today.

154
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,260
-没办法  谁叫这是个好故事  -确实没错
-Yeah, but it's a good story.  -It is a good story.

155
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,180
好啦  如果没有人想讲个跟大号无关的事情
OK, if no one has any non-poop related announcements,

156
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,790
我这有一个
I have one.

157
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,960
正如你们大部分人都知道的  马库斯马上就要18岁
As most of you are already aware, Marcus is turning 18

158
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,310
得离开我们了
and will be leaving us.

159
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,550
我可以住他房间么
Can I have his room?

160
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,340
我们下周将给他举办一个小小的派对
We are going to be throwing him a little party next week.

161
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,410
马库斯  你有什么要求么
Marcus, any requests?

162
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,480
我能把我的头剃了么
Can I shave my head?

163
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,590
我指的是派对上想吃点啥
I was talking about food for the party.

164
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,100
不不  我没什么想吃的
No, I don't. I don't want food.

165
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,150
我就想剃个头
I want to shave my head.

166
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,520
好吧  只要拿着剃刀的是我  那就没问题
OK. As long as I hold the razor.

167
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,110
行
Cool.

168
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,710
其他人  有什么想法么
OK, everyone else, thoughts?

169
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,670
马库斯派对上我们该吃点啥
Food for Marcus' party, what are we going to do?

170
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,450
好啦  好啦
OK, OK.

171
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,010
麻烦大家一个一个说
Everyone, one at a time, please.

172
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,000
谢谢路易斯还举了手
Luis, thank you for raising your hand.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
那边那个怪胎是谁
Who's the weird guy over there?

174
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,800
那是奈特
Oh, that is Nate.

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,380
拜托不要让他难堪  这可是人家第一天来
Please do not be jerks to him. It is his first day.

176
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,790
-你想来点自我介绍么  -好啊
-Do you want to introduce yourself?  -Um, sure.

177
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,200
好的
Yeah.

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,290
大家好
Hey.

179
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,470
你们已知道  我叫做奈特
Uh, as you know, my name's Nate.

180
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,310
我  我刚刚
And, uh, I just--

181
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,390
停了一年学校的课  想着可以
I took a year off of school because, you know,

182
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,640
出来收获一些社会经验
I just wanted to get some life experience.

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,950
而且我一直就很希望能照顾下社会底层的孩子们
And I always wanted to work with underprivileged kids.

184
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,620
你他妈的什么意思啊
Hey, what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

185
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,700
冷静点  马库斯
Marcus, settle down.

186
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,220
我没事  就想知道你说那句话是什么意思
No, I want to know what you mean by that,

187
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,640
"社会底层"
"underprivileged."

188
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,660
我并不是那个意思
That's not what I meant.

189
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,060
那么说话前先他妈想清楚
Then think about your fucking words before you speak!

190
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,820
-你个菜逼  -你被降级了
-Newbie!  -Hey! That's a level drop.

191
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
回你自己房间去
Go to your room.

192
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,170
快点回去
Go to your room.

193
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,790
对不住了兄弟
Sorry, man.

194
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,540
真的不好意思
Sorry.

195
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,270
级别和情绪  你们都了解规矩的
Um, levels and feelings, you know the drill.

196
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,860
路易斯开个头吧
Let's start with you, Luis.

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,280
绿色  还成
Green. Fine.

198
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,450
银色  一般般
Silver. Whatever.

199
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,740
黄色  感觉不大对劲
Yellow. I feel funny.

200
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,880
绿色  都还不错
Green. All right.

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,780
黄色  有点烦
Yellow. Annoyed.

202
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,460
12号收容所  我是格蕾丝
Short Term 12, this is Grace.

203
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,600
这会就来
Right now?

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,530
所以你觉得怎么样
So what do you think?

205
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,780
-什么  -我的新台灯
-Hmm?  -The new lamp.

206
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,200
还怪好玩儿的
It's really a trip.

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,600
你触摸金属部分就能开关
You can turn it on and off by touching the metal part.

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,780
试试看呗
Try it.

209
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,020
-有意思吧  -是的
-Cool, huh?  -Hmm.

210
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,500
话说我要去参加一个小组会议
Look, I'm supposed to be in a group session like right now.

211
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,770
你介意我们边走边聊么
You mind if we walk and talk?

212
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,980
不介意
No.

213
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,880
这是贾登
This is Jayden.

214
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,340
她今早刚被安排给我们
She just got appointed to us this morning.

215
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,190
她爸爸是我朋友的一个朋友  人很好  很有文化
Her father's a friend of a friend, real nice guy, very cultured.

216
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,800
那她为什么不跟她爸一起住
Why isn't she with him?

217
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,620
他妻子前几年去世了
Oh, he lost his wife a few years back.

218
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,740
后来贾登就没给她爸爸好日子过
Jayden hasn't made life very easy on him.

219
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,650
她在几个收容所进进出出好几回了
For the past couple of years,

220
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,010
都是因为危险行为
she's been in and out of group homes for dangerous behavior.

221
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,060
上周她还咬了自己治疗师的鼻子
Last week she bit her therapist's nose.

222
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,270
真棒
Great.

223
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,500
没错  所以我们将在工作日收容她
Yeah, so we'll have her during the week,

224
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,450
不过她周末能回家
but she gets weekend home visits.

225
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,540
好的
All right.

226
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,940
我告诉她爸我们会照顾好她的
I told her father we'd take good care of her.

227
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,280
-我一向都照顾好所有人  -我知道
-I take good care of everyone.  -I know you do.

228
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,250
这也是为什么我相信你也会照顾好贾登
That's why I'm trusting you to do the same with Jayden.

229
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,790
-她什么时候到这呢  -说不定这会儿已经到了
-When does she get here?  -She might be here already.

230
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,910
我喜欢你的名字  贾登
I like your name, Jayden.

231
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,380
这是个男生的名字
It's a boy's name.

232
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,390
真的么
Really?

233
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,950
我不觉得
I don't think so.

234
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,290
威尔・史密斯
Will Smith

235
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,490
是这么觉得的（威尔・史密斯的儿子也叫贾登）
did.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,040
听着  这些东西你不能留在房间里
OK, well, these things you can't keep in your room,

237
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,220
我们会帮你保管  就放在外面的柜子里
but we'll keep them in the closet out here,

238
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,790
想用就尽管来拿
and you can check them out whenever you want them.

239
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,400
行了  我知道规矩的
Yep, I know the rules.

240
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,250
不准有皮带  不准有剃刀  不准有剪刀
No belts, no razors, no scissors,

241
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,950
连自由也他妈的没有
no fuckin' freedom.

242
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,940
-不准说脏话  -妈的我居然忘了这条
-No cussing.  -Shit, I forgot about that one.

243
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,350
刚才这句这么狡猾我就放过你了
I'm going to let that one slip because it was clever.

244
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,160
好了  走吧  去看看你的房间
All right. Let's go see your room.

245
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,270
就是这啦
Here it is.

246
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,950
还真诱人
Wow, it's so inviting.

247
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,780
你在墙上挂什么都没关系  只要内容合适就行
You can put whatever you want on the walls as long as it's appropriate.

248
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,710
所以阴茎的照片也不行
So no pictures of penises?

249
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,280
除非是科普性质的
Not unless it's very scientific.

250
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,430
看起来真棒
Oh, wow. This is really cool.

251
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,920
才没呢  都是乱画的狗屎
No, that's crap.

252
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,400
这你都能叫狗屎  我真妒忌你
If you call that crap, I'm jealous.

253
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,090
上床前你要是把脏衣服挂在外头的话
If you put your clothes outside the door before bedtime,

254
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,100
值夜班的人会来帮忙清洗
the overnighters will wash them.

255
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,020
还有  门不能关上
And, um, you can't keep your door closest.

256
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,650
我现在已经不会那么做了
I don't do that anymore.

257
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,770
我并没有说你会这么做
I'm not saying that you do.

258
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,750
我的意思是我真要想自残的话
I mean, even if I ever did want to cut myself,

259
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,110
这扇门就算是他妈开着的也没法阻止我
keeping the fuckin' door cracked isn't going to stop me.

260
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,670
我可已经警告过你别说脏话了
I already warned you about cussing.

261
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,420
那句话可要被算作降级
That one's going to be a level drop.

262
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,690
天啊被降级了呢  我可该怎么办好啊
Oh no, a level drop. What am I going to do?

263
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,650
你这种态度对我们谁都不好
Your attitude is not helping either one of us.

264
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,700
-话说那家伙怎么了  -哪个家伙
-Hey, what happened to that guy?  -What guy?

265
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,570
那个害你拉裤子的大个子家伙
The big kid that made you poop your pants.

266
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,960
-韦斯利  -对
-Wesley.  -Yeah.

267
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,770
他之后又逃跑了
He ran away again,

268
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,370
结果两天之后有人在灌木丛里发现了他的尸体
and then two days later someone found him dead in the bushes.

269
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,270
什么
What?

270
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,070
这才是这个故事真正的结局
That is the real ending to the story.

271
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,020
我不喜欢这部分
I don't like that part.

272
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,730
-亲爱的一起走吗  -我得去清醒下头脑
-Sugar, coming with me?  -I'm going to clear my head.

273
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,520
奈特  第一天你干得还不错嘛  谢谢
That was a good first day, Nate. Thank you.

274
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,020
回见
See ya.

275
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,550
那好  兄弟
All right, man.

276
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,470
-保重  -行
-Yeah, take it easy.  -All right.

277
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,510
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

278
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,210
你是格蕾丝吗
Grace?

279
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,680
进来吧  亲爱的
Come on in, Hon.

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,500
测试结果出来的确是阳性的
So the test did come back positive.

281
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,840
太好了
Lovely.

282
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,400
你现在感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

283
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,000
我自己在家已经做过大概七八次测试了
I already did, like, seven of those tests at home,

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,980
所以并不会太惊讶
so I'm not really surprised.

285
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,640
好  那接下来你有这么几个选择
OK, well, you have a few options to explore.

286
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,860
我们可以一起梳理一下
And we can go over it for--

287
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,660
不如就预约周六的检查
We can just make an appointment for Saturday.

288
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,060
你不想听听看其它选择么
You don't want to hear the other options?

289
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,100
不用了
Uh-uh.

290
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,470
行
OK.

291
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,150
你以前怀孕过么
Have you ever been pregnant before?

292
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,290
怀过一次
One time.

293
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,440
好
OK.

294
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,910
懒虫  怎么这么久才回来
Hey, stinker, what took you so long?

295
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,800
别这样
Oh, no.

296
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,220
我不知道你原来还留着那顶蠢兮兮的帽子
I didn't know you still had that stupid hat.

297
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,960
这顶蠢兮兮的帽子我可是留定了
I will always have this stupid hat.

298
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,880
你这在干嘛呢
What's going on in here?

299
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,480
既然你跟单车偷情去了
Well, since you were out cheating on me with your bike,

300
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,040
我决定给自己做一点墨西哥菜
I decided I'd make myself some chiles rellenos,

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,260
酿辣椒  玉米饼  还有我妈最爱的番茄辣酱
homemade tortillas, and my mom's famous salsa.

302
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,210
看起来我们两个人吃也够了
Looks like there's enough for two.

303
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,740
好吧  我可不这么觉得
All right. I doubt it.

304
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,610
梅斯  你可没必要嫉妒弗洛伊德
Mase, you don't have to be jealous of Floyd.

305
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,090
弗洛伊德  你的单车现在还有名字啦
Floyd? Your bike has a name now?

306
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,820
那还用说  我们关系可好了
Of course he does. We're very close.

307
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,890
我搞不懂他有什么好的
I don't know what you see in him.

308
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,170
摸起来很顺滑
Mmm. Nice grip.

309
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,200
坐上去很舒服
Comfy seat.

310
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
怎么可能比我的还要舒服
There is no way his seat is as comfy as mine.

311
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,730
这倒没错
You're right.

312
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,470
我先去洗个澡好了
I think I'm going to go take a shower.

313
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,830
弗洛伊德可是让我大汗淋漓
Floyd got me all sweaty.

314
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,480
我恨死那部单车了
I hate that bike!

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,160
操你妈的  弗洛伊德
Fuck you, Floyd.

316
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,320
好啦  我的搞定了
OK, I'm done with mine.

317
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,170
好啦
On, yeah.

318
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,640
马上就好
OK, yep. Almost there.

319
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,240
你这是在最后关头乱涂乱画吧
Those are some crazy last-minute changes you're making.

320
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,340
差不多吧  我鼻子画的太烂了
Yeah, well, I really suck at noses.

321
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,540
好吧  你先来
OK, you go first.

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,010
我勒个去
Aw, damn it.

323
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,920
你永远画得这么好
Yours are always so good.

324
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,080
谢谢
Thanks.

325
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,150
不过我看起来好像流浪汉
I look like a homeless guy, though.

326
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,790
你本来看起来就像流浪汉
You do kind of look like a homeless guy.

327
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,120
谢谢  我脸上那是啥
Oh yeah, thank you. What's that on my face there?

328
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,290
-这个吗  -是的
-Oh, that?  -Yep.

329
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,250
那是你胡子上残留的一小片鳄梨
Well, that's the piece of avocado that's in your beard.

330
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,020
-不是吧  -真就是的
-No.  -Yes.

331
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,830
-卧槽  -我说吧
-Oh, fuck.  -Yes.

332
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,680
-它从头到尾可一直待在那儿  -喔
-It's been there the whole time.  -Ooh, yeah.

333
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,740
所以画出来的效果才这么好
So now you're all nicely painted.

334
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,570
提醒得真及时  谢谢你
Thank you for saying something-- sooner

335
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,560
确实很及时  只是
I did. I just--

336
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,260
好啦  来看一眼我的
OK. Um, all right, here we go.

337
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,050
平复好你的心情  不然你是会被惊呆的
Just take it easy, OK, because you're going to freak out when you see this.

338
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,610
我觉得这是我目前为止最了不起的作品
I think it might be my best one yet.

339
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,040
好吧
OK.

340
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,320
点评下嘛
Hmm? Come on.

341
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,160
你他妈可不能小瞧这幅画
You can't fuck with that.

342
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,390
我确实他妈的不能小瞧这幅画
I can't fuck with that.

343
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,220
-这鼻子画得也太精彩了  -是的
-That nose is amazing.  -Yeah.

344
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,030
我大概是照着蘑菇形状画的
And I was going for kind of a mushroomy thing in there.

345
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,020
那是胡子么
Is that a beard?

346
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,030
不是  我只是
No. I was, uh--

347
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,470
我只是想制造些阴影而已  我觉得还挺好看
I was trying to shade. I think it looks pretty cool.

348
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,460
确实挺好看
Yeah, it looks very cool.

349
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,090
不过我头上长出来的是啥
What's growing out of my head?

350
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,630
你在问这些东西么  这是花
Oh, these? Flowers.

351
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,280
他们代表了你那美丽的脑袋里种种奇思妙想
They represent the peculiar thoughts that grow out of your gorgeous mind.

352
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,040
你为什么要对我这么好
Why are you so nice to me?

353
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,390
你这会儿是认真的么
You being serious now?

354
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,300
好吧  这很简单
Well, it's easy.

355
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,040
因为你是我这一生中见过的最怪胎
It's because you are the weirdest,

356
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,000
又最美丽的人
most beautiful person that I've ever met in my whole entire life.

357
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,150
没啥
Um. Nothing.

358
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,150
只是你好久没有这么热情地亲我了
It's just been a long time since you kissed me like that.

359
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,180
又在说大话
That's not true.

360
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,420
我们已经九天又十三个小时没有做爱了
Well, we haven't had sex in 9 days and 13 hours.

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,950
还精确到小时是吧
Down to the hour, huh?

362
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,990
我做错了什么吗
Did I do something?

363
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,710
没有
No.

364
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,530
你棒极了
You're wonderful.

365
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
那是怎么回事
What is it, then?

366
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,950
你总得让我了解你在想些什么吧
Please, you have to let me in your head once in a while

367
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,050
不然我在这都快要担心疯了  好么
or I'm just going to go nuts, OK?

368
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,450
你这么做都是为我么
Are you doing this just for me?

369
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,750
你还好吧
You OK?

370
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,820
-还好  -那好
-Yes.  -Yeah?

371
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,260
你需要我停下来么
You don't want me to stop?

372
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,040
-停下来  -为什么
-Stop.  -Why?

373
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,180
-快停下来  -喔
-Stop!  -Ow!

374
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,160
卧槽
Shit.

375
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,950
又咋了格蕾丝
What the hell, Grace?

376
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,110
好啦大伙们
OK, everyone.

377
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,470
我知道你们大部分人都见过她了
I think most of you have already met her,

378
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,150
不过还是要说明下我们社区有新成员加入了
but we have anew member of our community.

379
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,730
贾登  你想自我介绍下么
Jayden, would you introduce yourself?

380
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,500
请不要被我的不友好冒犯
Please don't be offended if I'm not very friendly,

381
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,890
不过我很快就要回去跟我爸住了
but I'm going to be living with my dad soon,

382
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,610
所以我并不想在短期的友谊上浪费时间
and I don't really like wasting time on short-term relationships.

383
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,690
不是刻意针对你们其中的谁
So, you know, it's nothing personal.

384
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,910
她看上去真是非常友好
She seems like a really nice girl.

385
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,900
我相信我们大家都能尊重她的私人意愿  是吧
Hey, I think we all can respect her space, OK?

386
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,500
大家今天想玩些什么
OK, what do we want to play for rec today?

387
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
威浮球
Wiffle ball, dude!

388
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,650
-好  -得了吧  伙计
-OK.  -No, man.

389
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,620
你永远都在玩那么幼稚的游戏
You're always playing that stupid game.

390
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,000
那是因为你怎么玩都这么烂吧
Because you always suck at it.

391
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,930
除非你技术变好了  等到那时再考虑别的吧
Until you get good at it, maybe we could stop playing it.

392
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,700
-嘴别太贱了啊伙计  -你们俩都够了
-Watch your mouth, bro.  -Both of you, cut it out.

393
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,220
别人还有什么意见么
Any other suggestions?

394
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,690
萨米你说
Yes, Sammy?

395
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,800
我们可以玩大家伙与小家伙么
Can we play Big and Small?

396
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,620
这是个真正存在的游戏  还是你刚刚编出来的
Is that a real game, or is that a game you just made up?

397
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,950
这是个我刚刚编出来的真正存在的游戏
It's a real game that I just made up.

398
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,500
好吧
OK.

399
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,400
那也许你等会儿可以把规则解释给我听
Well, maybe you can explain that to me later.

400
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,840
排成一行  伙计们
Straight line, guys.

401
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,180
我先去查下房  等会见
I'm going to do room checks, so I'll meet you.

402
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,820
好的
Oh, OK.

403
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,290
纳斯  你好
Hi, Nas.

404
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,710
大家加油
Come on, guys.

405
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,870
加油  桑塔  加油
Let's go, Shawnta, let's go!

406
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,780
我们来玩儿棒球吧
All right, we got a baseball game.

407
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,930
来吧  你们能行的
There you go. You got this.

408
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,270
萨米  萨米
Sammy. Hey, yo, Sammy.

409
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,750
-快去捡球  -快跑丫头  快跑
-Get-- get the ball!  -Run, girl, run!

410
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,750
走啊  萨米
Come on, Sammy!

411
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,450
这游戏对你来说太幼稚了么
You too good for this game?

412
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
什么
What?

413
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,110
威浮球对你来说太幼稚了么
Too good for wiffle ball?

414
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,660
我不喜欢出汗的感觉
I don't like sweat.

415
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,150
话说康纳  你走过来点
Hey, you know what, Connor? Just come-- just come closer.

416
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,730
马库斯来了  他肯定又打不中球
It's Marcus. He ain't going to hit it.

417
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,140
你确定你不用拿一根粗点的球棒么
You sure you don't want to get the fat bat?

418
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,130
真的吗
No?

419
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,300
看到了吧  一阵
Strike one, everybody.

420
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,250
一阵了
Strike one.

421
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,500
-这可不算数  -这可是刚好投到位啊拜托
-That wasn't no strike.  -That was right down the middle.

422
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,830
这可是大联盟的规则  你没办法遵守么
This is the big leagues, boy. You can't handle it?

423
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,450
你就继续吹牛吧
Better keep flapping them gums.

424
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,700
你可以来陪我们跳大绳么
Hey. You want to jump rope with us?

425
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,000
我猜不可以
No?

426
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,990
不好意思
Sorry.

427
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,130
我们不能陪你们
We're not supposed to.

428
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,830
我们说的可不是这意思
That's not what we meant.

429
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,500
我也能一起听么
Can I hear?

430
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,170
三振了  出局了换人吧
Strike three. Change it up.

431
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,150
我猜你妈下周能见到你肯定很高兴吧
Bet your ma is real excited to see you next week, huh?

432
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,930
-马库斯  -你他妈说啥
-Marcus!  -What the fuck?

433
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,750
你这个贱逼  你刚才他妈说我妈啥
What the fuck did you about my mama, you little bitch?

434
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,370
你想干什么
What are you doing?

435
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,860
快给我滚去长椅那儿
Get your ass over to the bench.

436
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,160
行啦行啦  大家来帮忙把路易斯抬走吧
Come on, come on. Guys, get Luis out of here.

437
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,540
马库斯还好吧  你行么
Is Marcus OK? You good?

438
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,600
行了我来吧  我们走吧路易斯
Yeah, I got it. Luis, come on.

439
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,460
小心点
Come on.

440
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,140
你身上  哪里疼
OK, where-- where where-- where does it hurt?

441
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,890
来吧  在这坐下
Come on. Come on, sit over here.

442
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,440
我们就在这休息会儿  好么
We're going to sit down for a little while, OK?

443
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,370
你还好吧伙计  你感觉怎么样
You OK, man? How do you feel?

444
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,930
感觉很糟  这简直就疯了吧
Not good. I mean, that-- that was crazy.

445
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,740
他们真就这么野蛮地打架么
They just fight like that?

446
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,600
奈特我可没在问你感觉怎么样
Nate, I'm not asking you how you're feeling.

447
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,700
是的
Right.

448
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,140
你还好吧
How are you?

450
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,290
你得跟我坦白都发生了什么事
You need to tell me what the hell is going on.

451
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,760
暴力加上藏毒
Assault and drug possession.

452
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,000
你知道这就够你去蹲少管所了吧
You realize that's enough to get your ass thrown in juvie.

453
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
你觉得我他妈真的在乎么
Do you think I give a fuck?

454
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,770
你还有一周就可以离开这里了
You're out of here in less than a week.

455
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,150
你太聪明了  远远不该被困在这儿
You're so much smarter than this.

456
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,970
-我知道外面的世界很凶险  -我他妈什么都不怕
-I know it's scary out there.  -I ain't scared of shit.

457
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,400
其实我想说的是你真的不会想
All I'm saying is, getting thrown in jail is not

458
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,640
被扔进监狱的
what you want to do.

459
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,510
我爸在那儿被关了十年
My dad has been in there for 10 years.

460
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,290
我不想你也遭遇这种事
I don't want that for you.

461
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,670
直接回你房间
Straight to your room.

462
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,330
房间打扫完之前可没有自由活动
No free time untilall your chores are done.

463
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,140
他这又是怎么了
What's going on with him?

464
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,150
他只是不想离开罢了
He doesn't want to leave.

465
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,080
我该找他聊一下么
Should I go talk to him?

466
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,930
好吧  那我就这样乖乖进去等马库斯
All right, I'll just be inside

467
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,870
把我揍个屁滚尿流
letting Marcus kick the shit out of me.

468
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,250
玩得开心点
Have fun.

469
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,270
你有什么新歌词想让我试听一下么
You got some new lyrics you want to try out on me?

470
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,520
里面可是很多脏话
There's a lot of fucks in it.

471
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,320
我不会告密的
I won't tell.

472
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,130
大概这样就行
Mm-hmm. Those are pretty much it.

473
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,670
-节奏比较慢  -好吧  我来试试
It's slow. All right, let's see.

474
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,700
我来试试看
Let's see here.

475
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,210
这样行么
Like that?

476
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,190
开始了
Yeah. All right.

477
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,370
临近十八岁一切都不再重要
It don't matter, now, damn near 18.

478
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,630
我脑海里的一切美好都他妈的已经消散
All the pretty pictures in my fuckin' head is faded.

479
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,240
一想到生养我那家伙就周身不爽
And when I think about that trick that raised me,

480
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
那婊子她可真的会犯神经
I thinkabout sick, because the bitch is crazy.

481
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,560
臭婊子你给我滚蛋  伤痛也都统统滚蛋
Fuck that bitch, nigga, fuck that pain.

482
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
我神志紊乱但你却还填满我的脑海
Your body's in a ditch inside this turned up brain.

483
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,910
我说你怎还好意思  好意思当妈
I mean, I can't see how you claim it, you being ma?

484
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,940
医生们反应敏锐从坑蒙拐骗中将我救走
Doctors snatched me out the snatch of pure evil with eagle claws.

485
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,340
你个贱货  带着你的生活给我滚蛋
Ho, ho, ho, slut, fuck the way you want it.

486
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,940
让你低能的小儿子捕鸽求生
Got your young, dumb son pitching pigeons for money.

487
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,160
天气再好也冰冷刺骨
I mean, it's colder than the bitch when it's sunny.

488
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,800
屡次三番扑灭我的热情
Blows raining down on the glow.

489
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,470
真的还敢声张你仍爱我
Got the nerve to tell me you love me?

490
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,300
我说  又来
I said, again?

491
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,040
又来
Again?

492
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,260
又来这套说辞
Sell it again?

493
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,110
臭婊子我可才十岁
Bitch, I'm 10.

494
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,990
让我出去结交朋友
Let me go outside and function with friends.

495
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,470
你称你是妈妈  是母亲
You say you ma? You mother?

496
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,730
你他妈是女王吗
You the father-fucking queen?

497
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,520
我说好吧  我爱她  所以我尽弃前嫌
I say, all right, I love her so I flip it again.

498
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,650
没有下次了婊子  因为我比你坚强
No, not this time, bitch, because I'm stronger than you.

499
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,010
没有下次了婊子  我会比你更强
Not this time, bitch, swinging harder than you.

500
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,580
没有下次了婊子  我没有选择余地
No, not this time, bitch, you ain't leave me a choice.

501
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,550
我神志紊乱但你却还填满我的脑海
You just a body in a ditch in the brain of a boy.

502
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,280
临近十八一切都他妈糟透
All fucked up now, damn near 18.

503
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,060
往昔苦痛却都不会退却
All the pictures in my past ain't never fading.

504
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,520
总是心存幻想
I'm always wishing for something amazing,

505
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,030
但你人生如此混账哪还会有希望
but whenyour life is shit then it ain't no trading.

506
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,880
所以把我写到你的书里你才知道
So put me in your book so you know what it's like

507
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,910
不知道正常生活是什么样的滋味
to live a life not knowing what a normal life's like.

508
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,320
所以为我贴个标签你才知道
Put a label on my head so you know what it's like

509
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,410
不知道正常生活是什么样的滋味
to live alife not knowing what a normal life's like.

510
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,190
所以盯着我的双眼你才知道
Look into my eyes so you know what it's like.

511
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,820
所以盯着我的双眼你才知道
Look into my eyes so you know what it's like.

512
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,980
所以盯着我的双眼你才知道
Look into my eyes so you know what it's like to live a life

513
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,530
不知道正常生活是什么样的滋味.
not knowing what a normal life's like.

514
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,770
我  我不知道
Yeah, I-- I don't--

515
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,580
我不知道  不知道该说些什么了
I don't know what to say, man.

516
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,490
没关系
It's cool, man.

517
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,950
我就只想去剃个头
I just need to shave my head.

518
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,040
你觉得格蕾丝还会愿意来剃么
You think Grace will still shave it?

519
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,230
我喜欢你墙上的新装饰
I like the new wall decor.

520
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,910
谢谢  他们真的非常有启示性
Thanks. They're actually very informative.

521
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,080
我能跟你一起画画么
Can I draw with you?

522
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,010
当我九岁十岁时
When I was 9 or 10,

523
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,490
我会为我妈的男朋友们画肖像
I used to draw portraits of all my mom's boyfriends.

524
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,520
然后以一张十块钱的价格卖给他们
And then I'd sell them to her for $10 apiece.

525
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,030
你妈有多少男朋友
How many boyfriends did she have?

526
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,760
多到我最后存的钱都可以去买
Enough that I was able to save up

527
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,950
一台防摔的便携CD机
and buy one of those portable CD players with anti-shock protection.

528
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,220
-好古老的样子  -没关系
-You're old.  -Whatever.

529
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,630
其实还蛮有趣
Those things were cool.

530
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,640
你知道奇怪的是什么吗
You know what's weird?

531
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,410
当我给这些家伙画画的时候
Whenever I was drawing portraits of, you know, those guys,

532
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,400
我总是会花特别长的时间
I would always take forever.

533
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,200
光是描边就要用半个小时
30, 40 minutes just stringing them along, saying,

534
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,990
还一边说着自己要多加点阴影
oh, I've just got to do a couple more shadows,

535
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,030
或者再修改下鼻子什么的
or, I'm just fixing the nose.

536
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,820
我也不知道为什么
I don't know why I did that.

537
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,280
我真的讨厌他们每一个人
I hated every single one of them.

538
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,400
或许你只是试图把他们从你妈身边支开吧
Maybe you were just trying to keep them away from your mom.

539
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,410
或许吧
Maybe.

540
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,390
你搞定了么
-Are you done?

541
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,500
差不多了  只需要再加点阴影  再修改下鼻子就好
Almost. I've just got to add a few shadows and fix the nose a little.

542
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,100
你可还真他妈聪明啊
You are such a smartass.

543
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,840
你也被降级了
That's a level drop.

544
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,210
哦不  千万别把我降级
Oh no, not a level drop.

545
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,740
我等会还想玩桌上足球
I wanted to play foosball later.

546
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,480
太可惜了
Oh, too bad.

547
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,090
好啦
OK.

548
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,710
搞定了
Finished.

549
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,510
想看眼么
You want to take a look?

550
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,060
马库斯  你看起来好极了
Looks great, Marcus.

551
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,340
你自己看一下
Check it out.

552
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,210
我头上还有包么
Is it lumpy?

553
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,750
什么意思
What do you mean?

554
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,640
我一般都留着长头发
I usually keep my hair long.

555
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,400
因为她总是爱打我的头
It's where she used to hit me at.

556
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,430
我头上现在还有包么
Is it still lumpy?

557
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,390
没事了兄弟
No way, man.

558
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,580
一点都看不出来
Not at all.

559
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,590
你自个儿瞧瞧吧
See for yourself.

560
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,710
摸起来还挺顺滑
Pretty smooth.

561
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,500
头后面呢
What about the back?

562
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,470
没有伤疤吗  没有
No scars? No--

563
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,760
什么都没有吗
no nothing?

564
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,600
看起来棒极了
It looks really great.

565
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,410
梅森
Mason.

566
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,480

Hmm?

567

我有些事情想跟你说
I have something to tell you.

568
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,320
说吧
Yeah?

569
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,520

What's up?

570
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,400
我们马上就要有宝宝了
We're going to have a baby.

571
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,080
什么
What?

572
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,470
我们马上就要有宝宝了
We're going to have a baby.

573
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
真的吗
We are?

574
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,570
真的
Mm-hmm.

575
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,490
好吧
OK.

576
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,700
等我一下
Uh, give me a minute.

577
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,360
我的天啊
Oh. boy!

578
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,180
卧槽
Holy shit.

579
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,440
你知道我们没问题的吧
You know we can do this, right?

580
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,350
因为我们将会成为一对了不起的父母
Because we are going to be some amazing parents.

581
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,540
你说是吧
OK?

582
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,030
我爱你格蕾丝
I love you so much, Grace.

583
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,950
爱你爱到都要失去理智了
So much it's insane.

584
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,000
给我看看
Let me see.

585
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,390
什么
Hmm?

586
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,270
还看不出来呢
You can't tell yet.

587
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,100

Come on.

这感觉太奇妙了
That is so crazy.

589
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,420

-Did you hear about Sammy?  -What?

590
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,780
昨晚他们把他的玩偶都拿走了
Last night they took all his dolls away.

591
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,200
他的治疗师把这叫做学会放手
His therapist is calling it a lesson in letting go.

592
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,770
都什么狗屁
Bullshit.

593
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,340
那些玩具都是他妹妹的吧
Those are all his sisters, right?

594
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,900
他还没准备好进行这一步
He's not ready for that.

595
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,790
该吃药了  萨米
It's time for your meds, Sammy.

596

告诉医生我需要吃更大剂量的
Can you tell the doctor I need a higher dosage of

600

Trazodone?

601
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,780

00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,290
一次性遭遇这么多鲨鱼可是非常
To encounter so many sharks can be--

619
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,630
这件事恰好发生在夏至前夜
The fact that this occurs

620
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,150
这一巧合不禁让我想到
on the eve of the summer solstice left me wondering.

621
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,450
妈的  你能帮忙看一下孩子么
Damn it. Will you watch the kids?

-Why can't she close her door?  -She's a cutter.

632
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,020
这样你们就都失业了
and you'll all lose your fucking jobs!

633

If you just open the door, then we won't bother you anymore.

我们就只能使用武力了

-You shouldn't be here, Grace.  -What's wrong, Mason?

653
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,740
你个臭傻逼软蛋搞不定我
Can't handle me for yourself, you weak-ass fuck?

654
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,060
还要这婊子来帮忙
Need the bitch to do it for you?

我恨你们
I hate you.

661
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,870
这没关系
That's fine.

662
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,340
你现在用不着喜欢我
You don't have to like me right now.

663
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,680
等情绪过去了就好
Just let it pass.

664
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,550

-How is she?  -I guess she's in the cool-down room now.

You want to see mine?

678
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,670
我的天
Shit.

679
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,270
那个是我打喷嚏的结果
That one's from a sneeze.

680
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,890
所以割错了地方  伤口特别深
Slipped and cut too deep.

681
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,390
我差点就把跟腱切断了
Almost cut my achilles.

682
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:28,780
为什么要这么做
Why?

683
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,330
我妈去世了
My mom died.

684
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,120
我就去跟我爸过
I went to live with my dad

685
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,670
只是当你内心在滴血时
and--it's impossible to worry about anything else

686
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,170
是没办法担心其它事的
when there's blood coming out of you.

687
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,440
妈的我真讨厌那玩意儿
God, I hate that thing.

688
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,210
我也是
Me too.

689
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,190
你想歇多久都随你
Take as much time as you need.

690
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,360
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you!

691
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,890
吹蜡烛  吹蜡烛
Blow them out! Blow them out!

692
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,080
快吹
Go!

693
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,910
贾登
Jayden!

694
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:39,650
大屁股大屁股
Ah, big booty, big booty, big booty!

695
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,300
大屁股呼叫四号
Big booty number four.

696
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,130
-四号收到呼叫五号  -五号收到呼叫六号
-Number four, number five.  -Number five, number six.

697
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,860
-六号收到呼叫五号  -五号收到呼叫十号
-Number six, number five.  -Number 5, number 10.

698
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,140
七号收到呼叫大屁股
Number seven, big booty.

699
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,340
大屁股收到呼叫十号
Big booty, number 10.

700
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,920
拜托  她还在这工作
Come on, she works here.

701
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,410
她真应该感到羞愧
She should be embarrassed.

702
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:57,800
我确实很羞愧
I am embarrassed.

703
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,410
好了没事  大家都会犯错
Hey, it's OK. It happens to all of us.

704
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,730
再来一轮怎么样
Let's go for another round Ready?

705
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,680
大屁股大屁股
Ah, big booty, big booty--

706
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,590
好了你们慢一点
Hmm, slow this down a little bit.

707
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,850
你们可一点节奏感都没有
Yo, y'all ain't got no rhythm, man.

708
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,750
确实没错
Tell me about it.

709
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,960
我已经很努力保持节奏感了
I'm trying to keep them in line.

710
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,410
可真的好难
It's just so hard.

711
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,910
梅斯  你对我亲如手足
Mase, I love you like a brother

712
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,850
但一旦要低调行事你就是我的耻辱
but I got tosay that when it come to being discreet, you're a disgrace.

713
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,120
他以为我们都不知道
I mean, he think we all don't know about him

714
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,930
他和格蕾丝偷偷约会的意图
and Grace on the low undercover trying to date.

715
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,870
我才不知道你在说些什么乱七八糟的东西
I don't know what you're talking about.

716
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,430
既然我是下一个
Uh, I'm out the gate, right?

717
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,800
大家都叫我奈特
My name is Nate.

718
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,400
初来乍到你们都把我吆喝
When I came here, y'all tried to player-hate.

719
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,080
大家都快坐下
Everyone sit down, please.

720
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,610
我们出现了一个擅自离开的情况
We have an AWOL.

721
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,560
贾登
Jayden!

722
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,940
-格蕾丝  -跟孩子们待在一起
-Grace!  -Stay with the kids!

723
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,390
我找到她就跟你打电话
I'll call you when I get her.

724
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,620
这种情况也是会发生的  不用担心
This happens. It's fine.

725
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,330
贾登
Jayden!

726
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,770
贾登  麻烦你走慢点好么
Jayden, can you slow down, please?

727
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,240
我觉得我快要吐了
I feel like I'm going to barf.

728
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,730
保持在安全距离外
Keep-- keep the same distance.

729
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,540
就这停下
Stop!

730
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,940
好的  好的
OK. OK.

731
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,630
你出门可就不能碰我了
You can't touch me outside of the grounds.

732
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,770
那我能跟你一块儿走么
Well, can I walk with you?

733
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,890
随你怎么走  但我绝对不会回去那儿了
Walk all you want, but I'm not going back there.

734
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,680
那就走吧
Let's walk, then.

735
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,200
贾登  你也知道你不该出现在这儿
Jayden, you know you're not supposed to be here.

736
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,700
我们现在在他爸爸家
Hey. Um, we're at her dad's house.

737
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,680
我不认为家里面有人但她还是进门了
I don't think that anyone's here, but she went in anyway.

738
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,780
好的  那谢谢了
OK, thanks.

739
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,770
他不在家么
He's not home?

740
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,440
你想回去么
Do you want to go back?

741
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,040
好吧
OK.

742
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,010
你还好么
You OK?

743
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,670
我们明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,970
我写了个故事  你想听听么
You want to hear a story I've been working on?

745
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,100
当然想啦
Of course.

746
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,110
这是个童话  所以里面都是些浅显的词语
Well, it's a kid's story, so there aren't any big words.

747
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,360
明白
OK.

748
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,430
很久很久以前  在大洋底下
Once upon a time, somewhere miles and miles

749
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,390
很深很深的地方
beneath the surface of the ocean,

750
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,330
住着一只小章鱼  她的名字叫妮娜
there lived a young octopus named Nina.

751
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,390
妮娜每天大部分时间都在用岩石和贝壳
Nina spent most of her time alone making strange creations

752
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,250
创作各种奇奇怪怪的东西  她非常开心
out of rocks and shells. And she was very happy.

753
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,110
但在某个星期一  一只鲨鱼突然出现了
But then on Monday the shark showed up.

754
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,430
鲨鱼问  "你叫什么名字"
"What's your name?" said the shark.

755
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,450
"妮娜"  她回答说
"Nina," she replied.

756
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,850
"你想做我的朋友么"  鲨鱼又问
"Do you want to be my friend?" he asked.

757
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,480
"好啊"
"OK.

758
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,740
"但我需要做些什么吗"  妮娜答到
What do I have to do?" said Nina.

759
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,560
"没什么了不得的"  鲨鱼接着说
"Not much," said the shark.

760
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,380
"就让我吃掉你的一只胳膊就好"
"Just let me eat one of your arms."

761
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,180
妮娜从来没有过朋友  所以她在疑惑
Nina had never had a friend before, so she wondered

762
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,820
要交上朋友是不是值得她这么做
if this was what you had to do to get one.

763
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,110
她低下头  看着自己的八条胳膊
She looked down at her eight arms and decided

764
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,580
心想即使少了一条也不会多糟
it wouldn't be so bad to give up one.

765
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,230
于是她就送了一只胳膊给她这位了不起的新伙伴
So she donated an arm to her wonderful new friend.

766
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,390
那个星期后的每一天  妮娜和鲨鱼都会一起玩儿
Every day that week, Nina and the shark would play together.

767
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,720
他们一起探索洞穴  一起堆砌沙堡
They explored caves, built castles of sand,

768
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,370
一起游得飞快飞快
and swamreally, really fast.

769
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,240
然后每天晚上鲨鱼都会饿肚子
And every night the shark would be hungry,

770
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,900
妮娜就会递给他另外一只胳膊
and Nina would give him another one of her arms to eat.

771
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:35,260
一直到星期天  在玩了一整天后鲨鱼又告诉妮娜
On Sunday, after playing all day, the shark told Nina

772
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,610
他感觉很饿
that he was very hungry.

773
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,280
"我不明白"  她说
"I don't understand," she said.

774
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,300
"我已经给了你六只胳膊  你怎么还想再要一只"
"I've already given you six of my arms, and now you want one more?"

775
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,690
鲨鱼望着她  友善地笑着说
The shark looked at her with a friendly smile

776
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,350
"我并不想要一只胳膊"
and said, "I don't want one.

777
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:55,110
这回我想要剩下的全部  "但是为什么呢"  妮娜问
This time I want them all." "But why?" Nina asked.

778
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,510
鲨鱼接着回答说  "因为这就是交朋友的目的"
And the shark replied, "because that's what friends are for."

779
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,870
鲨鱼吃完了他的大餐
When the shark finished his meal,

780
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,930
他觉得非常悲伤和孤独
he felt very sad and lonely.

781
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,640
他想念和别人一起探索洞穴  一起堆砌沙堡
He missed having someone to explore caves, build castles,

782
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,130
一起游得飞快飞快的感觉
and swim really, really fast with.

783
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,390
他非常想念妮娜
He missed Nina very much.

784
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:28,410
所以他决定游去找寻下一个朋友
So he-- he swam away to find another friend.

785
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,790
贾登
Jayden?

786
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,980
你爸爸伤害过你么
Did your dad ever hurt you?

787
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,370
他现在还在伤害你么
Does he still hurt you?

788
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,770
我们不能让她回她家
We can't let her go back there.

789
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,620
放心吧  那不会发生的
That's not going to happen.

790
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,400
你今天做得很棒
You were pretty amazing today.

791
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,880
谢谢
Thank you.

792
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,390
麻烦再来点吧
More, please.

793
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,310
都再来点  都再来点
More for everyone. More of everything.

794
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:47,980
有谁想先吃点甜品么
Anyone, dessert first?

795
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,310
甜品  先来点甜品
Dessert? Dessert first?

796
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,640
不好意思  麻烦安静一下
Excuse me, excuse me.

797
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,670
大家好  大家好
Hello, hello. Hi.

798
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,310
不过我还是再用英文说一遍
But I'm going to say it in English

799
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,960
这样我就不用让自己再次出丑了
so I don't embarrass myself any more than I need to.

800
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,280
我想表达的就是
Uh, I just want to take a moment

801
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,180
谢谢你们  妈妈和爸爸
to say thank you, Mama, Pops.

802
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,630
我认为在座各位当中已经没人还把你们当作
I don't think anyone here thinks of you

803
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,880
养父母了
as just our foster parents.

804
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,970
我甚至不知道养父母是什么意思  因为在我眼中
I don't even know what that term means because to me,

805
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,500
你们就是我的父母
you're just Ma and Pa.

806
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,800
当我感谢你们接纳了我们所有人的时候
And I think I speak for everyone here when I say,

807
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,830
我相信其他人也是这么想的
thank you for taking us in.

808
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,620
感谢你们在我还是个对什么都害怕的愣头青时
For taking me in when I was just a punk kid

809
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,930
接纳了我
who was scared of everything.

810
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,640
当我孤单没有依靠的时候  你们收留了我
When I had no one else, you accepted me and you showed me

811
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,660
告诉了我
what it was like--

812
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,270
被爱是什么滋味
um, what it was like to be loved.

813
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,870
要不是你们  我们当中没有人能有今天的成绩
And none of us would be here if it weren't for you.

814
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:04,680
大家都看一看这个家庭有多美丽
Just look at this beautiful family you made.

815
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,830
都一起举杯向我们的国王和王后致敬
So let's all lift our glasses to our king and queen.

816
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,440
三十周年快乐
Happy 30th, you guys.

817
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,380
我生命中的一切美好都源于你们
Everything good in my life is because of you.

818
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,090
干杯
Salud.

819
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,750
干杯
Salud!

820
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,280
嫁给我好么
Will you marry me?

821
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,120
-你是认真的么  -当然
-You're serious?  -Yeah.

822
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,930
不能更认真了
I'm dead serious.

823
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,480
谁他妈又在打我们座机
Who the hell is calling on the land line?

824
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,430
你好
Hello?

825
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,010
我其实是  她的未婚夫
This is, uh, actually her, uh, fiance.

826
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:37,490
没错
Yeah.

827
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,750
如果这是关于她爸爸的消息
And if this is about her dad, it'd probably be best

828
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,230
你们最好告诉我  让我来转达
if you just let me relay the message.

829
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,480
我操
Oh, shit.

830
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,020
谁打的电话
Who was it?

831
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,600
是缓刑部门某个工作人员
That was someone from the probation department.

832
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,240
他们说你爸爸大概下个月
They said that your dad's probably going to

833
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,450
就要被释放了
get released next month.

834
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,550
我觉得我们需要好好聊一聊
I really think we need to talk through some of this stuff.

835
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,030
现在不是时候  梅森
Not right now, Mason.

836
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,290
我会好起来的  我只是
I'll be fine. I just--

837
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:16,990
我只是需要好好干活
I just need to work.

838
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,060
-你好  -你好
-Hey.  -Hi.

839
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,450
马库斯的鱼昨晚死了
Marcus' fish died last night.

840
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,050
什么
What?

841
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,320
他觉得路易斯跟这有关系
He thinks Luis had something to do with it.

842
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,280
真是这样么
Did he?

843
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,910
告诉我你没对马库斯的鱼做出什么事
Tell me you didn't do something to Marcus' fish.

844
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,390
-你在说啥  -路易斯  你快告诉我
-What?  -Luis, tell me.

845
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,030
可我真不知道你在说啥
I don't know what you're talking about.

846
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,190
我说的是真的
I swear!

847
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,770
马库斯  我很抱歉
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

848
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,960
不是路易斯干的
It wasn't Luis.

849
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,090
那已经没关系了
It don't matter.

850
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,670
如果你觉得没问题的话  我想自己待会儿
I'd like to be left alone, if that's cool with you.

851
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,770
好吧
OK.

852
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,670
你需要什么就尽管告诉我
Just let me know if you need anything.

853
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,520
你们见过贾登么
Have you guys seen Jayden?

854
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,740
杰斯  贾登在哪儿
Jess? Where's Jayden?

855
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:58,090
她爸爸昨晚来把她接走去过周末了
Oh, her dad showed up last night and took her on pass for the weekend.

856
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,130
-什么  -杰克还签字批准了
-What?  -Jack signed off on it.

857
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,520
你他妈是在跟我开玩笑吧
Are you fucking kidding me?

858
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,650
你怎么能让她走
How could you let her go?

859
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:13,820
简  等会儿我再回你电话好么
Uh, Jan, let me call you right back, OK?

860
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,700
她爸爸打了电话来  他道了歉
The man called. He apologized.

861
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,180
他说出了些私人的急事
He had a personal emergency.

862
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,430
可那根本不是关键点啊  杰克
That's not even the point, Jack.

863
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,850
你究竟有没有读我的报告
Did you read my report?

864
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,980
我当然读了  而且我也非常担心
Of course I did, and I was very concerned.

865
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,590
但当贾登的社工负责人问她时
But when Jayden's social worker asked her about it,

866
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:29,290
她说她爸爸从来都没有虐待过她
she said her father had never been abusive in any way.

867
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,500
她当然会这么说
Of course she said that.

868
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,370
她很害怕啊
She's fucking scared!

869
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:34,410
难道你们高中的时候他妈的没学过么
What the fuck did they teach you guys in grad school?

870
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,880
杰克  在她心目中她爸爸永远都在她身后
Jack, in her mind he is always right behind her,

871
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,000
监视着她的一举一动
watching her.

872
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,350
即便是她在睡觉  她在上厕所
When she is sleeping. When she is taking a shit.

873
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,150
甚至当她跟治疗师在一起时
When she is alone with her therapist,

874
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:46,000
她爸爸都会在那儿监控着她  随时准备开始一顿暴揍
he is right there watching her, ready to pounce.

875
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,170
你以为她会勇敢地走出阴影承认被虐待吗
And you just expect her to just come out and say it?

876
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,950
你们这些家伙他妈脑子都被屎吃了吗
Are you guys fucking stupid?

877
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,640
她到这里是来寻求帮助
Because she was here asking for help,

878
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,170
可你又把她送回了鲨鱼的血盆大口之中
and you just send her back to the fucking shark.

879
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,530
格蕾丝  我知道你很不高兴
I realize you're upset, Grace.

880
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:58,330
但对着我大吼大叫并不是有效的
But yelling at me isn't an effective form of

881
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:00,020
沟通方式
communication.

882
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,710
好
OK.

883
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:08,080
好的  杰克  我很抱歉
OK, Jack. Jack, I'm sorry.

884
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,250
在我们解决这件事之前  麻烦你取消周末假期
Please cancel the pass until we figure this out,

885
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,730
我了解她  我也了解她家里糟糕的情况
because I know her and I know that things are not good at home.

886
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:15,870
你怎么确定你真的了解她
And how do you know that?

887
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,670
就凭着她念的一个童话故事吗
Because she read you a children's story?

888
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,520
别他妈侮辱我  杰克
Don't fuck with me, Jack.

889
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,820
我每天从早到晚都在第一线跟这些孩子打交道
I am on the floor every day with those kids.

890
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,640
昨天晚上这个女孩就坐在我身边  哭得泪流满面
And last night, that girl sat next to me and she cried,

891
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,560
她尝试用她知道的唯一一种方式来告诉我
and she tried to tell me the only way that she knew how.

892
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,880
格蕾丝  你只是一个前线工作人员
Grace, you are a line staff.

893
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,090
试图解释每个人背后的悲剧不是你的职责
It's not your job to interpret tears.

894
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,060
接受过专业培训的治疗师才是负责这方面的
That's what our trained therapists are here for.

895
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,930
那些治疗师就他妈连狗屁都不懂
Then your trained therapists don't know shit.

896
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,570
她跟你明说她被她爸虐待了么
Did she tell you that she was being abused by her father?

897
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:41,680
她用不着明说
She didn't have to.

898
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,840
如果真要把那孩子从她亲生父亲身边带走的话
If I'm going to take that child away from her biological parent,

899
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,430
没错  她必须得明说
yes, she does.

900
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,920
真他妈荒唐
This is bullshit.

901
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,880
格蕾丝  我和这些孩子接触的时间可比你的年纪还大
Grace, I have been working with these kids longer than you've been alive.

902
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,790
而且我愿意为他们当中的每一个人鞠躬尽瘁
And there's not one of them that I wouldn't die for.

903
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,220
每当我凝望进他们一颗颗破碎的心时
I look into those broken eyes.

904
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,010
我都很想出去找到那个对他们造下这种孽的王八蛋
I want to go out and find the asshole who did that to them

905
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,060
把他们打个屁滚尿流
and beat the shit out of them.

906
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,140
但尽管我每天都如此挣扎
But although I feel that way every single day,

907
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,140
我却知道我不可能找到每一个罪人
I know I can't track down everyone who's hurt them.

908
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,260
我知道我没法治愈他们所有人
I know I can't heal all their wounds,

909
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:16,530
我也知道不能指控他们的父母是性犯罪施暴者
and I can't start accusing all their parents of being sexual offenders.

910
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,670
尤其是这种情况下  他们还是朋友的朋友  对吧杰克
Especially when they're friends of friends, right, Jack?

911
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,970
那我们没什么好讲的了  格蕾丝
We're finished here, Grace.

912
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,400
简
Jan--

913
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,480
萨米
Sam.

914
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,400
马库斯
Marcus?

915
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,810
马库斯你在吗
Marcus?

916
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,350
马库斯
Marcus?

917
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,150
你在路易斯的房间做什么
What are you doing in Luis' room?

918
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,160
噢  天啊
Oh, no.

919
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:50,100
路易斯  路易斯
Luis? Luis?

920
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,480
路易斯  你还好吗
Luis!

921
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,630
怎么了
What?

922
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,920
哦不
No.

923
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,940
我操  我操
Shit. Shit!

924
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,100
梅森  快来人啊
Mason! Somebody, anybody come!

925
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,240
快来帮帮我  路易斯
Help me! Luis!

926
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,410
路易斯  把你的枕头给我  快给我
Luis, I need your pillowcase right now. Give it to me.

927
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,620
快点啊
Quicker, please.

928
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,970
马库斯
Marcus?

929
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,590
马库斯  马库斯  求你看着我
Marcus. Marcus, please look at me.

930
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,750
马库斯  看着我  你会好起来的
Marcus, look at me. You're going to be OK.

931
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,070
我只需要你好好看着我
I just need you to look at me.

932
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,010
马库斯  看着我
Marcus, look at me.

933
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,980
为什么他妈的这么久都还没人来
What the fuck is taking so long?

934
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,680
我有了真正的朋友
Now I have a real friend.

935
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,720
我就叫你道里好了
I'm going to call you, uh, Dudley.

936
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,090
斯通医生
Dr. Stone--

937
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:04,880
布莱克・约翰逊  请拨号93
Blake Johnson, dial 93, please.

938
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,500
布莱克・约翰逊  拨号93
Blake Johnson, dial 93.

939
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,930
他们还是说不准
They still don't know anything.

940
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,220
我做不下去了
I can't do this.

941
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,620
格蕾丝
Grace.

942
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,160
嘿
Hey.

943
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,330
格蕾丝  你这是去哪儿
Grace, where are you going?

944
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,050
我做不下去了
I can't do this.

945
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,960
好吧  那我们走  我们回家
OK, let's go. Let's go.

946
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,850
我开车载你
I'll drive us home.

947
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,910
我不想回家
Don't want to go home.

948
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,710
我指的不是这件事
That's not what I'm talking about.

949
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,170
我知道今天糟糕透了
I know it's been a really fucked up day, OK?

950
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:51,840
梅森  你完全不知道我现在有多痛苦
Mason, you have no idea what I'm going through right now.

951
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,790
那就都告诉我  这才是解决问题的方式
Then tell me. That's how this works.

952
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,280
你先告诉我都发生了什么  我才可以牵着你的手
You talk to me about it so that I can take your hand

953
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,530
带着你熬过这些苦痛
and fucking walk through this shit with you.

954
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,840
毕竟这也是我的责任
That is what I signed up for, OK?

955
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,920
如果你一直紧锁心扉  我什么都帮不上
But I cannot do that if you won't let me in.

956
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,670
我说不出来
I can't.

957
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,640
对不起
I'm sorry.

958
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,880
你说对不起
You're sorry?

959
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,680
格蕾丝  你是认真的么
Grace, are you serious?

960
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,580
我可等了你这么久
I've been waiting for you for a really long time, and I

961
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,460
这等待中的每一分钟我都不会后悔
wouldn't take a second of it back

962
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,180
因为我实在是太他妈爱你了
because I love you so goddamn much, OK?

963
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:36,170
可我苦苦等了三年想让你告诉我
But I have been waiting for three years for you to tell me

964
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,190
为什么到现在你还是不肯信任我
why you still don't trust me.

965
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,350
我可是等了三年
I've been waiting for three years for you

966
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:43,060
我只是希望你能采取你对孩子们反反复复提出的建议
to just once take the advice that you give your kids

967
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,610
学会跟人分享自己脑海中
every fuckin' five minutes and learn to talk about

968
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,720
究竟在经历什么
what's going on inside your head.

969
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,000
为了我你也不肯这么做吗
You can't do that for me?

970
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,980
是什么都没关系  你都可以告诉我
Whatever it is, OK, just talk to me.

971
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,700
但我真的没办法做到
But I can't do this.

972
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,560
真的没办法
I can't--

973
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,170
我不能嫁给你
I can't marry you.

974
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,360
我不能怀上你的孩子
I can't have your baby.

975
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,180
我不能拥有这一切
I can't have any of it.

976
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,950
我做不到
I can't do it.

977
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,260
所以你想做些什么
So what do you want to do?

978
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:50,240
你要去堕胎么
Do you want to get an abortion?

979
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,080
我已经预约了
I already made the appointment.

980
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,930
你想做什么都行  满意了吧
Do whatever you want, OK?

981
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,220
因为我也受够了
Because I'm done.

982
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
孩子们根本不在乎它
Kids don't care nothing about it.

983
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,690
艾德  你想吃点吗
Ed, do you want some vittles today?

984
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,280
好的  奶奶
I do, Granny.

985
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,180
我醒来胃口很好  能吃下很多东西
I worked up a right smart appetite fetching sticks for old Duke.

986
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,460
这就是问题所在
Yes, that's the trouble around here.

987
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,480
动物正在掌管我们
The critters are taking over.

988
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,630
比利・梅给宠物喂了我的腌萝卜
Billie Mae has done made pets out of everything but my pickled turnips.

989
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,820
我们吃什么
What are we going to do for vittles?

990
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,550
等等  我记得附近开车的地方
Wait, I remember someplace to drive near--

991
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,540
你想干什么
What are you doing?

992
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:00,210
这也有点太过头了吧
That's a little extreme, don't you think?

993
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,830
你是疯了吗
Are you going crazy?

994
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,710
可能是吧
Probably.

995
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:45,370
当我还是你这么大的时候  我就不得不
When I was your age, I had to stand in a courtroom

996
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:49,110
跟一群陌生人一起站在公堂上  告诉他们
with a bunch of strangers and tell them all the ways

997
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,200
我爸爸是怎么虐待我的
that he abused me.

998
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,220
他是怎么打我的
What he hit me with.

999
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,340
他是怎么喝醉酒
How he got drunk.

1000
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:04,810
他又是怎么强迫我跟他一块儿洗澡
How he forced me to take a shower with him.

1001
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,870
还让我怀了孕
Got me pregnant.

1002
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:19,070
我让他坐了牢
I sent him to prison.

1003
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,290
我从没讲过这段经历
I didn't talk about it.

1004
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,860
也没有想过这段经历
I didn't think about it.

1005
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,650
一直到我遇见你
Until I met you.

1006
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,400
可是我完全手足无措
And I don't know.

1007
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:46,480
我身体里还有个宝宝呢  但是我不知道
I have a baby inside of me, and I don't know.

1008
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,860
我真的不知道我正在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

1009
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,850
我只是真的想帮助你
I was just trying to help you.

1010
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,490
我的天啊
Oh my god.

1011
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,520
他喜欢用腰带
He loves the belt.

1012
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,000
真是毫无新意
It's such a cliche.

1013
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,680
贾登  我们得对这做出应对
Jayden, we have to do something about this.

1014
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,730
比方说在他还在睡觉的时候
Should go bash his face in with a baseball bat

1015
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,100
用棒球棍打烂他的脸
while he's sleeping?

1016
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,710
我觉得我们还是快点离开这儿
Uh, we should get out of here.

1017
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,960
他睡得可死了
He'll sleep through anything.

1018
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,250
好  我们得快点离开
OK. Now we should get out of here.

1019
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,720
他们会问你很多的问题
They're going to ask you a lot of questions.

1020
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,900
这个过程会很痛苦
It's going to be hard.

1021
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,530
我会尽量不提到你拎着一根棒球棍
I'll try to leave out the part about you

1022
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:00,090
就闯进了我们家
breaking into that house with a baseball bat.

1023
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,450
谢谢
Thanks.

1024
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:08,370
你会成为一个非常好的母亲
You're going to be a really good mom.

1025
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,190
我告诉他这将是我最后一次回家
I told him this was going to be the last time I came home.

1026
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:24,890
因为我再也受不了了
Because I'm not going to take his shit anymore.

1027
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,680
当然他为此又发了一通大火
And that set him off, of course.

1028
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,840
不过我一点也不在乎
But I didn't care.

1029
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,220
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1030
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,020
我之前说的都不是真心话
I didn't mean what I said earlier.

1031
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:12,280
只是这段时间我的生活一团糟
I'm just really messed up right now.

1032
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,370
马库斯会好起来的
Marcus is going to get better.

1033
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,280
我觉得我也会好起来的
I think I am too.

1034
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:05,870
格蕾丝  我知道敞开心扉的对话很不容易
Grace, I know talking like this is really hard.

1035
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:10,610
不过这已经是我们见的第四次面了  我希望你能
But this is our fourth session together, and I'd really like

1036
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:12,730
努力地试一下  好么
you to try, OK?

1037
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,880
可我不知道该说些什么
I don't really know what to say.

1038
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:25,540
你爸爸一周内就要出狱了
Your dad's getting out of prison in a week.

1039
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,700
你想聊聊这件事么
Do you want to talk about that?

1040
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:38,680
好吧
OK.

1041
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,440
你还好么
Are you OK?

1042
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,230
留神看我身后的显示屏
Watch that monitor over my shoulder.

1043
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,920
他大概就在  就在这儿
I think he's-- there we go.

1044
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,510
看到他了
There he is.

1045
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:24,340
别动  等一等
Stay with it. Hang on a second.

1046
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,320
再等会
Hang on.

1047
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,960
那是宝宝的心跳
That's-- that's the baby's heartbeat, man.

1048
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,000
我的天啊
Oh, man.

1049
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,790
你们仔细听好这个故事了  真是太他妈
So you need to get ready for this

1050
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,980
难以置信了
because it's so fucking unbelievable.

1051
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,290
这故事听起来可能很假  但我发誓是真事
It's going to seem fake, but I promise you it's not.

1052
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:26,350
-格蕾丝可以作担保  -还得取决你有没有实事求是
-Grace will vouch for it.  -It depends if you tell it right.

1053
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:28,050
绝对的实事求是
There is no way not to tell this right.

1054
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,780
这整件事情简直就是讲故事人的春梦
It is a storyteller's wet dream.

1055
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,270
-在说啥呢  -准备好听故事吧
-What?  -Get ready for this.

1056
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:33,200
好的你正好赶上了  我从头开始讲
OK, just in time. I'm going to start at the beginning, OK.

1057
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,750
行
OK.

1058
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:38,080
三年前  我们这有这么一位姑娘叫做莱莎・格林
So three years ago, right, we have this girl here named Liza Green.

1059
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,560
她十七岁  在当时比这儿所有孩子都要大
She's 17, older than everybody else on the unit at the time.

1060
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,980
并不是我龌蹉的想法
And I don't mean this in a pervy way or anything,

1061
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,210
但她真的很漂亮
but she's real pretty.

1062
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:46,370
她确实是美极了
She was gorgeous.

1063
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:47,960
所有的男孩子都喜欢她
All the guys on the unit want her,

1064
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,780
只是她太忙了  不愿为任何一个人抽空
but she won't give any of them the time of day because she was busy.

1065
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:52,370
-她总是在学习  -她也非常聪明
-She was always studying.  -She was very smart.

1066
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:53,790
相当聪明
Mm-hmm. Really smart.

1067
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,910
所以呢  在她到十八岁准备离开前两周
So two weeks before she turns 18 and leaves,

1068
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,340
我们有了一位新房客
we get this new intake.

1069
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:00,770
这男孩当时十五岁  他非常坚强
It's a 15-year-old guy. He's really tough.

1070
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,440
他也非常沉默  不过他看起来拽拽的
He's really quiet. But he's cool.

1071
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,930
他看起来很悠闲
He's just kind of like kicking back, checking out the scene.

1072
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:09,810
而且我发誓他刚来的第一周  我还没听他说过一句话
And I swear I didn't hear him say a word the whole first week he was here.

1073
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:12,100
但某天在社区会议上
But then one day we were doing community meeting,

1074
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,740
我们问谁有通告的时候
and we ask for announcements.

1075
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:16,270
这家伙举起了手
And this guy raises his hand.

1076
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:21,060
他直接望着莱莎・格林说到  我知道你不认识我
And he looks directly at Liza Green and he says, I know you don't know me.

1077
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,540
我也初来乍到
I just got here.

1078
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,730
但我只想说我一直都在注意你
But I just want to say that I've been watching you.

1079
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:27,640
我认为你是这破地方最有趣的东西了
I think you're the most interesting thing about this place,

1080
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:30,770
而且我很伤心在你离开前没时间深入了解你
and I'm really sad I'm not going to get to know you before you leave.

1081
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:32,140
我就想说这么多
I just wanted to tell you that.

1082
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,440
真是个花花公子
What a pimp!

1083
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,790
她怎么说呢  啥都没说
What did she say? Nothing.

1084
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,810
啥都没说吗  当时真是太尴尬了
Nothing? It was so awkward.

1085
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,540
完全受不了  太他妈尴尬了
Yeah, so fuckin' awkward I couldn't stand it.

1086
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:42,460
然后她就离开了  一句话也没跟他说
And then she left, and never talked to him.

1087
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,660
孩子们嘲笑了他一年
The kids teased him for like a year.

1088
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,650
那感觉一定糟透了
Oh, that blows.

1089
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:49,280
他一点都不在意  甚至一点没让他尴尬
No, he didn't give a shit. No, didn't even faze him.

1090
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,480
就像是他有着别人没有的经验和知识
It was like he knew something everybody else didn't.

1091
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,260
-这家伙是谁啊  -是马库斯
-Who is this guy?  -That was Marcus.

1092
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,000
-什么  -我从没听过这个故事
-What?  -I never heard this story.

1093
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,360
等等别着急  后面还更精彩
Oh, wait. It gets so much better.

1094
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,720
仔细听接下来这段
Yeah. Yeah, so check this out.

1095
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,820
某天早上我和格蕾丝准备去喝咖啡  我们走进咖啡店
Grace and I are getting coffee at Ronnie's this morning, and we walk in.

1096
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,510
猜猜我们见到谁独自坐在那儿
And who do we see sitting there alone at a table?

1097
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,750
就是马库斯
Marcus.

1098
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,460
他还好吧
How's he doing? Oh!

1099
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,200
他看起来好极了  他很不错
He looks great. He's so good.

1100
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,490
穿着笔挺的衬衫
Buttoned-up shirt.

1101
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:13,600
还啜着一杯卡布奇诺
He's sippin' on a cappuccino.

1102
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,870
-马库斯也喝卡布奇诺吗  -显然是的
-Marcus drinks cappuccino?  -Yeah.

1103
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,260
-我猜也是  -显然他现在会喝了
-Apparently.  -Yeah, I guess so.

1104
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,600
然后我们跟他聊天
Apparently now he does.

1105
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,460
问他近况如何
So we're talking to him and we're catching up.

1106
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,660
他告诉我们他在水族馆找到了新工作
And he's telling us about his new job

1107
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:24,200
赚到了多少小费
at the aquarium and how much he takes home in tips.

1108
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,450
他现在开始申请下学期打算回去上学
And now he's going to start applying for classes next semester.

1109
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:28,460
-天啊真棒  -是啊
-Oh my god!  -Yeah.

1110
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,620
这种感觉真的太奇妙了
And it's weird because I'm like,

1111
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,750
因为我从未见马库斯这么健谈
I have not heard Marcus talk this much ever, since I met him.

1112
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,930
就在想这都是为什么呢  他是见到我们太高兴了呢
Like, what is the deal? Is he excited to see us?

1113
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,930
还是对于什么事感到太紧张了
Is he nervous about something?

1114
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:43,680
这时我才注意到桌上还有另外一杯卡布奇诺
And that's when I notice there's another cappuccino on the table

1115
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,920
而且边上还有一只空椅子
and an empty chair next to him.

1116
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,350
然后电影情节般的场景他妈的出现了
And then just like in the fucking movies,

1117
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:53,230
厕所门突然打开  莱莎・格林走了出来
bathroom door flings open, out walks Liza Green.

1118
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,550
-他们是在约会么  -这已经是他们第五次约会了
-They were on a date?  -It was like their fifth one.

1119
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,310
-没错  -天啊
-Yes!  -Oh!

1120
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:02,110
然后她一坐下来这家伙的脸就变得通红
As soon-- as soon as she sits down, dude just goes beet-red.

1121
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:03,480
他觉得太尴尬了  他真是太可爱了
He's so embarrassed. Oh, it was so cute.

1122
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,040
太他妈可爱了  我都快笑尿了
Oh, it was so fucking cute, I almost pissed my pants.

1123
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,600
-看起来他们在一起很幸福  -真的太幸福
-Oh Jess, they look so happy together.  -So happy.

1124
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,720
然后他们
And there's just--

1125
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,920
又该干活了
Here we go.
