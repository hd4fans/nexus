1
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,644
Stroke! Stroke!

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,733
Stroke! Stroke!

3
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,192
Stroke! Stroke!

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,712
Come on, come on.

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,305
Pick him up, pick him up.

6
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,012
Son of a bitch!

7
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,473
I mean, Your Honor, that was a hell of a shot.

8
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,270
Well, I'm currently doing an
externship for two extra credits

9
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,446
as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten.

10
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,865
BJ Hookstratten?

11
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,570
That's more impressive than being in the top 5%.

12
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,280
Look, I don't know what kind of
offers you've had from Wall Street...

13
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,287
The top five, sir. In my class.

14
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,993
Not the top 5%. I'm sorry, I just...

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,296
Mr. McDeere, we've just offered you $68,000 a year

16
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,749
from arguably the leading law firm in Chicago.

17
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,630
Is there somewhere else you have to be?

18
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,461
Yes, sir. I have a job. I'm just on lunch break.

19
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,343
I know you've had a lot of offers.

20
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,392
Did you know, for example, that we have 127 clients

21
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,345
that are Fortune 500 companies?
Now, look, we'll offer you $74,000...

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,273
our billing requirement for a
first-year associate is only 2,000 hours,

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,522
not the usual 25 or 26 or 2,700.

24
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,446
We want you to have a life outside the office, Mitch.

25
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,274
And if you're a Lakers fan, we
have a fabulous box at the Forum.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,873
I know there are firms from all over the country

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,417
that have been up here offering you everything.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,621
But with your ability and ambition,
there is only one place for you,

29
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,831
and that's with our firm in Washington...

30
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,381
Let's stop talking about the ribbon on the package,

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,505
and start talking about what's in the package.

32
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,053
One of our partners is an
ex-governor, two are congressmen

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,131
and one's a former Senator of Agriculture.

34
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,843
May I take your coat, sir?

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,737
- Mitchell McDeere, right?
- Yes.

36
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,910
Lamar Quinn. Come on in.

37
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,367
I'd like you to meet

38
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,825
- Oliver Lambert, our senior partner.
- Mitch. Mitch.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,581
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Royce McKnight,

40
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,787
- our managing partner.
- How do you do, sir?

41
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,792
- Welcome.
- Care for a drink?

42
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,499
- No, I'm fine.
- Take a seat, Mitch.

43
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,470
Tired of interviews?

44
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,264
No, sir. I just don't quite know what to say.

45
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,183
Unusual for a lawyer.

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,387
I can get tongue-tied in any
number of situations, sir,

47
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,894
but it's usually with my wife.

48
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,476
Would you mind describing one, with your wife?

49
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,064
The first time I saw her.

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,945
Any time we argue.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,621
Whenever she walks into a room, as a matter of fact.

52
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,950
Might we ask about the rest of your family?

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,377
My father was killed in the coal mines

54
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,171
and my mother remarried and lives in Florida.

55
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,215
Brothers and sisters?

56
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,551
None.

57
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,426
Mitch, I hope you don't think us intrusive,

58
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,726
but stability in the family
has a special importance for us.

59
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,601
Bendini, Lambert & Locke is just a small Memphis firm,

60
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,603
41 lawyers.

61
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,812
But we're a large family. So we're careful.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,319
Now, sir, do you have any questions for us?

63
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,323
Do you have an offer in mind?

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,248
It includes a bonus schedule,

65
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,752
a low-interest mortgage so you can buy a home,

66
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:24,212
country club membership, and
we'll lease you a new Mercedes.

67
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,341
You pick the color, Mitch.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,263
Lamar, you haven't been paying attention.

69
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,466
His wife picks the color.

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,354
- Do I... Do I open it here?
- Of course.

71
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,152
Unless you can tell us what's in it.

72
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,942
A lawyer worth that offer
shouldn't have to open the envelope.

73
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,543
Mr. McKnight, you are the managing partner

74
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,667
at Bendini, Lambert & Locke, is that correct?

75
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,793
Yes.

76
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,169
Did Mr. Lambert, as senior partner,

77
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,047
give you any instructions regarding my employment?

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,378
He did.

79
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,429
And, Mr. McKnight, do you usually
follow Mr. Lambert's instructions?

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,637
Objection. Vague. Ambiguous.

81
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,096
Sustained.

82
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,436
What precisely were those instructions?

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,988
That you were in great demand,
and I should make certain

84
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,444
that we obtained your services
before a bidding situation developed.

85
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,321
How did you go about making certain?

86
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,959
I bribed a clerk in the Harvard Law placement office

87
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,958
for the exact amount of the highest offer,

88
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,250
and then added 20%.

89
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,925
Mitch, the letter you got from Bendini, Lambert & Locke

90
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,178
was the only one sent out. We want you.

91
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,079
Okay.

92
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,753
You're gonna have to leave
now. I'm expecting my husband.

93
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,584
The hell with him.

94
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,136
Come here.

95
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,636
Moo shu pork, Szechwan beef,
mandarin duck from Wong Boys.

96
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,099
It's even got a cork.

97
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,854
What's going on?

98
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,354
You remember the letter I
got from that firm in Memphis?

99
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,814
Memphis?

100
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,945
That's what I thought, until their offer.

101
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,572
What was the offer?

102
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,574
They didn't say. It's in there.

103
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,786
It's sealed.

104
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,212
I guessed.

105
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,047
What?

106
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,420
Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,932
Plus a 5% increase the second year.

108
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,351
Why?

109
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,809
"Why?" Whose side are you on anyway?

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,653
Yours.

111
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,482
Plus bonuses, plus a low interest mortgage...

112
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,191
As in a home, with grass around it?

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,904
They want to fly us down to Memphis for a little visit.

114
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,558
If you've been in one limo, you've been in them all.

115
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,368
Bye. See you later, Your Honor.

116
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,082
Sir.

117
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,043
Hey, Mitch.

118
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,798
Come on, associates first,

119
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,631
then lunch with the partners
in our private dining room.

120
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,559
He's our number one draft pick, so to speak,

121
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,559
and he's being romanced by the big boys

122
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,766
from New York and Chicago and everywhere else,

123
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,111
so we have to sell him on our
little firm here in Memphis.

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,277
Meanwhile, he's gonna try not to be embarrassed

125
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,452
while I remind you that he's about
to graduate from Harvard with honors.

126
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,616
Hear, hear.

127
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,457
No one's divorced in the Firm?

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,455
No one's divorced in the Firm.

129
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,132
- Impossible.
- No bachelors either.

130
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,134
What about women?

131
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,303
- They had one once.
- Only one?

132
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,553
Alice Krauss, wobbled around on 4" heels.

133
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,975
Affirmative action on stilts.

134
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,891
All white, all male, all married, huh?

135
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,902
- What the hell is this?
- There he goes.

136
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,152
Hey!

137
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,013
It's different from the northeast.

138
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,309
The pace, we're almost stately by comparison.

139
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,434
Courteous and not as gossipy.

140
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,686
We keep each other's secrets.

141
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,187
I like that.

142
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,604
What do you like about it?

143
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,112
All of it. It's a family. Just the way you said.

144
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,376
For the last three years,

145
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,962
I've been teaching in the
Boston area at a private school.

146
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,209
Do you work?

147
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,799
Well, not since I put Lamar through law school.

148
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,797
But, you know, working isn't forbidden.

149
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,379
- Forbidden?
- Working, by the Firm, you know.

150
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,635
- How could it be forbidden?
- It isn't.

151
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,810
Anyway, two babies in 14 months and
I had all the work I could handle.

152
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,559
- Do you plan to start a family?
- Maybe in a couple of years.

153
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,557
The Firm encourages children.

154
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,230
How do they do that exactly?

155
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,577
Hey, how about it?

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,245
How about it.

157
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,336
Okay, okay. The Love Boat band, the secret recipe ribs,

158
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,663
they're a little square maybe...

159
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,090
I don't mind square. I like square. Weird, I mind.

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,256
What do you mean, "weird"?

161
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,586
Well, here's a quote.

162
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,674
"The Firm does not forbid me to take
a job, and they encourage children."

163
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,349
Ask me why.

164
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,018
Because they love kids.

165
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,687
Because children promote stability.

166
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,182
Want to hear more?

167
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,602
No, you're right.

168
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,446
Don't pay any attention. I'm just
gonna throw myself over the rail.

169
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,238
- I think my will is self-explanatory.
- Okay, okay, okay.

170
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,949
These are nice people, Abby.

171
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,530
These are nice people. Okay.

172
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,866
I'm more impressed with it than
you are. You grew up with it.

173
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,953
Do you know what $96,000 a year is here?

174
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,795
It's like 150 in New York.

175
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,794
Did you ever think I'd make a six-figure salary?

176
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,546
Absolutely.

177
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,881
You did?

178
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,302
Well, your folks! Your folks
are only a few hours away, too.

179
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,724
You mean, if we fight, I don't have far to drive.

180
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,305
Exactly.

181
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,404
She made two phone calls from the hotel,

182
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,658
one to her parents and one to the Memphis School Board.

183
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,162
She seemed a little reluctant.

184
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,995
I'd hate to lose this young man.

185
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,750
I think she'll come around.

186
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,582
What about Kozinski and Hodges?

187
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,634
Have you spoken to Chicago?

188
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,004
I have.

189
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,473
It's not good.

190
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,302
We're gonna have to do something.

191
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,155
I drew the happy face.

192
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,496
Where's Memphis?

193
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,154
Is that it?

194
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,577
- Yeah?
- It looks different.

195
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,576
It's prettier than the pictures they sent.

196
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,793
"Mitch and Abby, we've taken the liberty
of furnishing the house temporarily.

197
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,711
"Just a few things to make you feel at home.

198
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,460
"Hope you don't mind."

199
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,594
Abby!

200
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,816
Not bad, huh?

201
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,152
Where's yours?

202
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,504
- Don't get up.
- Don't worry.

203
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,601
Mitchell McDeere.

204
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,304
Tad eager are we, Mr. McDeere?

205
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,316
What are you doing?

206
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,068
Dutch says you've been here since 6:30.

207
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,649
I thought I'd jump start the bar exam work.

208
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,076
Good. No associate has ever
failed the bar exam, you know.

209
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,903
Come on. I'll show you your new office.

210
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,826
Wally Hudson, Contracts.

211
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,578
- Here to help with the bar exam.
- Thanks, Wally.

212
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,577
No associate of the Firm has ever failed the bar exam.

213
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,999
The first day is a four-hour
multiple choice on ethics.

214
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,584
Look at the first six chapters.
I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.

215
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,172
Oh, no associate of this firm
has ever failed the bar exam.

216
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,927
No kidding.

217
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,931
- Ken Curry. Domestic Relations.
- Mike Allen. Wills and Estates.

218
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,600
Nina.

219
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,347
Fuck! Please.

220
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,726
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

221
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,607
Actually, I think I'm here to help you.

222
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,405
I'm Avery Tolar, your designated mentor.

223
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,653
Let's go to lunch.

224
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,276
Lunch? But it's not even...

225
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,534
Not even noon, I know. It will be a working lunch.

226
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,787
Come on up to my office while I drop this off.

227
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,002
Everything depends on billing.

228
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,166
How many hours you spend even thinking about a client.

229
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,258
I don't care if you're stuck in traffic
or shaving or sitting on a park bench.

230
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,801
Now, my particular field...

231
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,129
Is forming limited partnerships
for offshore corporations,

232
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,839
mainly in the Cayman Islands.

233
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,094
Good. I want you to review the last o
e I did for a client named Sonny Capps.

234
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,803
He made over 14 million last year,

235
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,435
paid less than 4% in taxes
and resents every buck of it.

236
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,269
But he paid us $400,000 in fees,
so I don't want to make him unhappy.

237
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,319
Take a look at the deal, see if
you can come up with anything.

238
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,147
Madge, tell him I'll call him in the morning, please.

239
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,153
Yes, Mr. Tolar. Should I save these for later?

240
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,360
- Could you, please?
- What do you mean by "anything"?

241
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,531
What do you think I mean?

242
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,655
I don't know, you're the risk taker.

243
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,580
Do you think I'm talking about breaking the law?

244
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,250
No, I'm just trying to figure
out how far you want it bent.

245
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,874
As far as you can without breaking it.

246
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,372
In other words, don't risk an IRS audit.

247
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,215
I don't give a damn about an
audit. They just better not win.

248
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,585
Yes, Mr. Tolar?

249
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,545
Something before lunch?

250
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,721
I should warn you the Firm frowns
on drinking during office hours.

251
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,343
Iced tea, please.

252
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,724
Bombay martini on the rocks, Ellis, three olives.

253
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,222
On the way.

254
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,773
Senator.

255
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,692
I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.

256
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,021
- Put that in the bedroom, please.
- Hey, hon, I made you some tea.

257
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,279
Kay, please. I've never had so many
people trying to do things for me.

258
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,611
It's the South, Abby. We encumber you with hospitality.

259
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,573
Would you like to have your phone
programmed for speed dialing, ma'am?

260
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,951
Other than my husband's office
number, let's see, that's...

261
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,209
We have it, Mrs. McDeere. We do
all the installations for the Firm.

262
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,633
What led you to law school?

263
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,258
- I can't remember, really.
- Sure you can, Counselor.

264
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,676
I was a delivery boy for a pizza parlor.

265
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,682
One day the owner got a notice from the IRS.

266
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,559
He was an immigrant, didn't know much English,

267
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,981
even less about withholding tax.

268
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,935
He went bankrupt. Lost his store.

269
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,483
That was the first time I thought of being a lawyer.

270
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,564
In other words, you're an idealist.

271
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,570
I don't know any tax lawyer who's an idealist.

272
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,028
When he lost his store, I
lost my job, and it scared me.

273
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,158
- Being out of work?
- No.

274
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,991
What the government can do to anybody.

275
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,709
What about you? What led you to law school?

276
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,007
It's so far back I don't think I can remember.

277
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,176
Sure you can, Counselor.

278
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,714
I used to caddie for young
lawyers off from work on week days

279
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,424
and their wives.

280
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:51,437
I'd look at those long tan legs
and just knew I had to be a lawyer.

281
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,145
The wives had long tan legs, too.

282
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,529
Ellis, another martini, please.

283
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,232
So we're not a couple of idealists.

284
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,943
Heaven forbid.

285
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,789
- Hi.
- Hi.

286
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,128
I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.

287
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,425
- Are you sure it's today?
- That's what he told me.

288
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,184
Kay?

289
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,399
There's been...

290
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,524
Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodges were killed.

291
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,030
We just got word about 20 minutes ago.

292
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,245
Did you meet them at the barbecue?

293
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,822
What happened, Kay?

294
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,408
We're not sure.

295
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,667
They were diving off a boat on Grand Cayman,

296
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,342
and then there was some kind of explosion on the boat.

297
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,731
Lamar?

298
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,105
Marty was...

299
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,149
His twin girls are a month older than our son.

300
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,327
I'm very sorry, Lamar.

301
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,996
By the way, Oliver wanted me to tell you,

302
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,713
you shouldn't be burdened with a student loan.

303
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,421
Excuse me?

304
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,891
If you bring the papers by tomorrow,
the Firm will repay it for you.

305
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,078
Kay was scared.

306
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,158
What? No, she was upset.

307
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,916
There is a difference between
being upset and being scared.

308
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,871
She was scared.

309
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,130
Of what? What, do you know her that well?

310
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,297
Maybe not.

311
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,425
But I've spent a lot of time with her lately.

312
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,977
They have their own horses.

313
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,851
Two of them. Quarter Horses.

314
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,818
Does that make half a horse?

315
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,115
Sorry. I...

316
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,787
and gently wipe away every tear from our eyes.

317
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,038
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

318
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,744
Amen.

319
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,295
Let us pray.

320
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,216
Lord our God, you are always
faithful and quick to show mercy.

321
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,766
Our brother Marty was suddenly
and violently taken from us.

322
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,388
Come swiftly to his aid.

323
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,603
Have mercy on him,

324
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,523
and comfort his family and friends

325
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,478
by the power and protection of the cross.

326
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,110
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

327
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,951
Let us go in the peace of Christ.

328
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,910
I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Oliver.

329
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,081
- Okay?
- Okay.

330
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,955
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right.

331
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,084
Mrs. McDeere, I'm Avery Tolar.

332
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,307
You're the reason I see so
little of my husband these days.

333
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,760
He must be the most ambitious man in the world.

334
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,015
One of them.

335
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,145
No, I mean leaving you every
day just to go off to work.

336
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,941
I'm sure you could manage.

337
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,773
Just tell me how.

338
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,911
Did you know them well? The men who died?

339
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,329
Yes.

340
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,748
You must be overwhelmed with grief.

341
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,373
People grieve in different ways, Mrs. McDeere.

342
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,141
Abby!

343
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,688
Hey, Hearsay, come here.

344
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,612
Shit.

345
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,536
- Is he in?
- Yes, Mr. Tolar.

346
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,081
Hell of a proposal, kiddo.

347
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,289
Just redraft this section on
repatriation of offshore funds.

348
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,668
I need it tomorrow.

349
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,797
- Tomorrow? I need another week!
- Can't have it, pal.

350
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,549
You and I are flying to the Caymans tomorrow morning

351
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,096
to take on Mr. Sonny Capps personally.

352
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,390
But the bar exam!

353
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,139
It will be here when you get back, kiddo.

354
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,689
Shall I stay, Mr. McDeere?

355
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,437
Would you like me to pick you up a sandwich?

356
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,768
No, I'm fine, Nina. Thank you. You go on home.

357
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,854
- Good night.
- Good night.

358
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,217
- So what's good here?
- I'm just having coffee.

359
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,005
I'm going with the steak sandwich.

360
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,807
Two steak sandwiches on rolls, please.

361
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,850
Two steak sandwiches on rolls.

362
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,104
You with Bendini, Lambert & Locke?

363
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,100
Yeah. How did you...

364
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,064
Sorry, I'm just a little...

365
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,319
It looks like they're working you to death.

366
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,366
They do that with new associates, I guess.

367
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,617
- I've just been with them now...
- Eight weeks.

368
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,245
Sorry, guys. I'm just a little punchy.

369
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,671
That firm looks like a health hazard.

370
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,841
- Hours they make you keep.
- Kind of work they make you do.

371
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,214
Kozinski and Hodges.

372
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,557
Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.

373
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,434
That's four dead lawyers out
of 41 in less than 10 years.

374
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,890
And none of them over the age of what, 45?

375
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:37,524
I mean, that beats the hell out of any
life insurance tables I've ever heard about.

376
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,525
Who are you guys?

377
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,531
Could we get those sandwiches to go, please?

378
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,451
We'll probably see each other again.

379
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,050
The car wouldn't start.

380
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,431
I got

381
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,445
caught in this incredible accident, 12 cars, maybe 13.

382
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,285
There was a pregnant woman in one of them.

383
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,704
I had to help deliver the baby.

384
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,666
It was a girl.

385
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,539
They said they're gonna name her Abigail.

386
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,795
Come on, Abby. Why do you think
I'm working like this, huh?

387
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,880
- 'Cause I want you to have all the stuff...
- Wait a minute.

388
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,886
Wait a minute.

389
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,389
I never asked for anything, Mitch,
except for us to be together.

390
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,560
But I want to give it to you.

391
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,147
I want to give you everything you gave up to marry me.

392
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,849
Stop it.

393
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,072
It's sweet. I know.

394
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,496
It's some kind of courtship, but I don't need all that.

395
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,039
Just bring me flowers sometime.

396
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,053
What were you working on all night?

397
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,684
Just, you know, it's...

398
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,443
It's just this stuff Avery's
got me doing for the Cayman trip.

399
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,112
Hey, want to have some eggs?

400
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,034
I had some eggs.

401
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,112
Want to have some naked?

402
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,552
You don't even know what moves me about you, do you?

403
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,311
Mitch, I know what you want, but it's not for me.

404
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,144
It's not even for you. And you know it.

405
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,904
It's easy for somebody rich to talk about being poor

406
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,907
like it's some fly that's bothering
you and you just wave it away.

407
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,740
This isn't about rich or poor.

408
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,248
This is about trying to fix something
that won't get fixed with 10 Mercedes.

409
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,751
Hey, that's not fair, Abby! That's not fair!

410
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,584
This is about a mother in a trailer park.

411
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,670
And a brother you pretend you don't have.

412
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,341
Have a nice trip.

413
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,607
Just follow me, and don't over-breathe.

414
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,854
What about Sonny Capps?

415
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,352
I thought we were under a lot of pressure.

416
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,687
We're under tremendous pressure.

417
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,114
If we don't get this dive in
before the bank, we can't do it.

418
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,284
You can't dive and then fly within 24 hours.

419
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,613
I don't see how you can dive
so soon after the accident.

420
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,040
We don't even know what
happened to Kozinski and Hodges.

421
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,867
Hey, there was a plane crash last week.

422
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,702
We didn't take a boat to the Caymans, did we?

423
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,216
That's ridiculous, Sonny.

424
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,386
Let us sit down with you for five minutes. Thank you.

425
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,891
Son of a bitch pays less than 5%
tax and wants to fire us. The Hyatt!

426
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,056
This new plan is very aggressive, Sonny,

427
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:10,402
and it defers all your tax liability for
years. And you could start right away.

428
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,067
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I can't talk right now.

429
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,067
These taxes are only deferred, right?

430
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,913
The future value of the tax dollars will
be less than half their present value.

431
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,248
- Who says?
- After the election...

432
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,413
Are you telling me who's gonna be in
the White House the next four years,

433
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,958
'cause that would be valuable information.

434
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,456
- Well...
- Mr. Tolar has a plan that...

435
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,965
That meets all your needs,
whoever's in the White House.

436
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,463
- Let him tell me.
- He's been trying to.

437
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,012
Hey, who the fuck are you? His lawyer or mine?

438
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,388
- Neither one, sir.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

439
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,974
Sonny, you're not the Firm's only concern here.

440
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,610
We put you into deals with other clients

441
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,024
where they may be very sensitive

442
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,903
about exposing their
relationships to outside attorneys.

443
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,361
You hear that, Counselor? That's a veiled threat.

444
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,492
If you're talking about our friends in Chicago,

445
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,240
they don't make money when I pay you fees.

446
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,542
You make money when I pay you fees.

447
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,665
They make money being in business with me.

448
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,004
And as long as they're making money,

449
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,874
they don't give a flying fuck who does my taxes.

450
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,426
Hey, you don't know me. I'm a nice guy.

451
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,003
You lose a million bucks for me,

452
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,925
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna break your legs.

453
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,759
Sonny, let's don't get carried away here, all right?

454
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,471
What did I say?

455
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,393
Maybe it's what you didn't say.

456
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,193
- "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?
- Thank you.

457
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,027
Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule

458
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,819
that virtually guarantees you zero tax with zero risk.

459
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,534
The basis of your stock would be the
face amount of the installment note,

460
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,698
but the stock would have no value.

461
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,913
Even so, it's deducted in offsets income.

462
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,709
You defer your tax in full even
though you have a bankable LC.

463
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,203
- Deferred till when?
- What do you care?

464
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,378
Whenever it is, it's still the best
interest free loan you'll ever get.

465
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,220
So the worst is, I pay my taxes much, much later.

466
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,428
No.

467
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,349
The worst thing is next year
they're going to close the loophole,

468
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,513
change the regs and if you
haven't grabbed this proposal,

469
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,931
you're gonna feel like you were fucked

470
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,390
with a dick big enough for an elephant to feel it.

471
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,816
You know that for a fact?

472
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,568
Hey, you like the word "protege"?
I never had one. You ever been one?

473
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,451
I'm A, you're B, right next door.

474
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,658
Avery, who's in Chicago?

475
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,040
We'll get to all that.

476
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,422
The hell with it.

477
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,836
Clean up and come on over.

478
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,509
You earned a good dinner and a night out.

479
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,757
Hey.

480
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,004
I lost my son.

481
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,957
Don't you think I would have screamed bloody murder

482
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,459
if I thought something was wrong?

483
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,008
You're right, Mr. Abanks, I'm
sorry. Okay? You're right. I'm sorry.

484
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,762
Nothing to bury even. Just a stone.

485
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,761
They never did find him or the other two.

486
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,768
What other two?

487
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,645
The other two who split the charter.

488
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,565
Your friends and two other guys.

489
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,443
- Lawyers?
- They were in swim suits.

490
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,736
They paid cash.

491
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,034
Were they American?

492
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:50,956
Could have been anything. One
was, I don't know, squat, heavy.

493
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,165
Other guy had long blond hair,
almost white, with weird blue eyes.

494
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,137
- Mitch?
- Yeah.

495
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,174
Grab a Red Stripe out of the fridge.

496
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,009
I'm a little slow.

497
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,597
Take your time.

498
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:20,026
I'm trying to look as pretty as
you, which I'm convinced I can.

499
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,610
It just takes me a little longer.

500
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,158
You got anything to munch on?

501
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,079
Yeah, there's a thing full of stuff next to the fridge.

502
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,159
It's got a lock on it. Use that
key from the ring I gave you.

503
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,840
Do you see it?

504
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,340
Yeah, sure.

505
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,358
You find something?

506
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:12,203
Listen, Capps is a tough guy, but he's also a blowhard.

507
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,869
He loves to give the impression that he's connected.

508
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,493
Thinks it's glamorous.

509
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,548
He said a couple of things.

510
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,468
Hey, you're about to take the bar exam.

511
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,391
Here's a multiple choice.

512
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,512
The difference between tax
avoidance and tax evasion is...

513
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,474
A, whatever the IRS says.

514
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,482
B, a smart lawyer.

515
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,819
C, 10 years in prison.

516
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,492
D, all of the above.

517
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,322
Being a tax lawyer's got nothing to do with the law.

518
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,077
It's a game.

519
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,996
We teach the rich how to play it,

520
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,702
so they can stay rich.

521
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,085
The IRS keeps changing the rules

522
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,084
so we can keep getting rich teaching them.

523
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,670
It's a game. One you just played very, very well.

524
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,676
Where's your beer?

525
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,099
I decided to wait for the rum.
I hear it's good down here.

526
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,768
Everything's good down here.
You deserve a taste of all of it.

527
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,197
I think that since we're here on this island,

528
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:41,205
there's things we can do on
it, you know, primitive things.

529
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,957
Come on, you deserve it.

530
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,212
Look, I don't mean to hurt your
feelings, but this isn't gonna happen.

531
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,468
Would you tell my friend I went back to the condo?

532
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,217
You don't know what you're missing.

533
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,478
Thanks anyway.

534
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,460
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me.

535
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,114
Are you all right?

536
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,319
It's okay. Just wait a minute.

537
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,034
Wait a minute.

538
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,995
Can I look at this?

539
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,952
You're not a doctor.

540
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,914
No, but I've

541
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,383
sprained a lot of ankles.

542
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,503
Mostly mine.

543
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,062
You should ice this.

544
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,519
You should also report that guy.

545
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,691
That was your boyfriend.

546
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,575
That was for money.

547
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:56,086
- Aren't you gonna finish?
- I'm sorry.

548
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,889
- You think that's...
- Got nothing to do with me.

549
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,394
- Is this too tight?
- No.

550
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,160
I work in a travel agency.

551
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:32,250
I wanted to feel like all those people

552
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,128
with first class tickets and pretty clothes.

553
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,302
I guess I wanted to feel...

554
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,348
Rich.

555
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,324
How much would it take to feel rich?

556
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,531
I don't know.

557
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,497
How much would it take to feel safe?

558
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,676
You did that.

559
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,225
You made me feel safe.

560
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,046
Hey...

561
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,319
Will you stay with me for a while?

562
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,658
Why don't you take the afternoon off? You deserve it.

563
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,705
Spend it with that pretty wife of yours.

564
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,826
Oh, shit, I forgot, she phoned last night.

565
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,836
What'd you tell her?

566
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,711
That you were probably walking on the beach.

567
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,923
I was.

568
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,252
I guessed right then, didn't I?

569
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,850
Okay, Mr. McDeere. If you'll sign where the "X" is

570
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,352
and initial where it's marked.

571
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:43,415
Well, well. The man from Gentleman's Quarterly.

572
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,584
How you doing, Ray?

573
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,386
Pretty fair. How's yourself?

574
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,844
It's a long time, huh?

575
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,397
It's okay. I've become a patient man.

576
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,106
Don't beat yourself up, kid.

577
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,692
If I wasn't here, I wouldn't want to be here either.

578
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,379
- Do you ever talk to Ma?
- A few months ago.

579
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,968
- Still with the same guy?
- They're all the same guy.

580
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,596
So, you finish law school?

581
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,764
Yeah.

582
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,268
That suit's a dead give-away.

583
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,900
What, you get a job on Wall Street?

584
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,903
- You always said...
- No, I'm not. I just...

585
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,158
I went with a firm across the river in Memphis.

586
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,659
Memphis?

587
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,241
Hey, Ray,

588
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,869
wouldn't it be funny if I went
to Harvard and you went to jail

589
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,876
and we both ended up surrounded by crooks?

590
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,046
Sonny Capps is thrilled. McDeere was dazzling.

591
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,722
I think we ought to pull Lamar out
of that tax seminar in Washington

592
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,471
and send Mitch instead.

593
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,348
Let him take the jet. Any problem with that, Bill?

594
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,896
No. No, no problem.

595
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,224
So far the kid's been real predictable.

596
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,772
If you're even half right, you're gonna
need some help. What does Abby think?

597
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,820
I haven't told her.

598
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,620
I guess...

599
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,950
I guess I don't want it to be real.

600
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,250
Nothing's real until I tell it to Abby.

601
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,759
How did you ever land a job
with a brother in the joint?

602
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,188
That's okay. I'd have done the same thing myself.

603
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:15,445
You were always around for me,
Ray. All those years after Dad died.

604
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,618
I'd have done the same.

605
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:22,074
You think I'd ever tell guys around
here I got a brother in Harvard?

606
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,208
Jesus, Ray.

607
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,129
Hey, listen. I want you to see a friend of mine.

608
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,257
His name is Eddie Lomax. He's a
private investigator in Little Rock.

609
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,584
Ex-cop.

610
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,261
Anything I can do for you?

611
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,464
Sure. Get me out of here.

612
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,843
Where to?

613
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,227
Anywhere I can see a whole lot of sky.

614
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,436
I can get through the days, I even eat the food.

615
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,647
It's amazing how much you miss the sky.

616
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,160
Ever plug one of these in only
you forgot to put the water in?

617
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,370
No.

618
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,965
- Do you know what happens?
- No.

619
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,792
The lights go out.

620
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,182
He's been dying to see you since you called.

621
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,430
That's what I saw. Tammy!

622
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,184
Mr. Lomax will see you now.

623
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,185
- Mr. McDeere.
- Yes.

624
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,144
I practically went to law school with you.

625
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,778
Ray talked about you every
stinking day for three years.

626
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,608
I was his cellmate, he must have told you.

627
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,035
Did he tell you, by the way, it was statutory rape?

628
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,159
She was 17. Looked 25. I got one to four.

629
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,209
Sit down. Sit down. Come on. Sit down,
sit down. You want some Sweet'N Low?

630
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,375
- You want some dairy cream?
- No.

631
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,919
You want some sugar? You want some...

632
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,371
Eddie, I've got some business

633
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,047
- I'd like to go over with you here.
- Good. Good. Good.

634
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,214
I owe your brother my life.

635
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,714
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you, dear.

636
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,967
That's my secretary. She is terrific.

637
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,800
But she's got a nutcase for a
husband. He's a truck driver.

638
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,759
He moved here to be close to Graceland.

639
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,139
The reason why, he thinks he's Elvis.

640
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,395
What do you think his name is?
It's Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.

641
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,396
I run across some strange things in this job.

642
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,775
Some things I'd never spray-paint on an overpass.

643
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,782
Now, what can I do for you?

644
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,947
- What a nice surprise.
- Avery.

645
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,584
They didn't have to disturb you.
You didn't have to come down.

646
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,161
Believe me, it's no bother.

647
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,291
I was just looking for Mitch.

648
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,624
Nina says he hasn't been in all afternoon.

649
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,256
I didn't mean for her to call you.

650
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,504
Didn't he come back with you?

651
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,388
I'll be honest with you. This
is not my area of expertise.

652
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,230
- But you think it's possible?
- Anything's possible.

653
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,559
I'll tell you one thing, if those
guys at the steak joint were feds,

654
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,893
you better watch out for them.

655
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,025
'Cause they don't give a damn about you.

656
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,028
I get some pretty pissed off husbands in here.

657
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:07,622
On the other hand, the lawyers at your
firm sure as hell seem accident prone.

658
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,328
Okay.

659
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,373
I'll see what I can find out.

660
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,707
You better let me call you.

661
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,637
You sure remind me of your brother.

662
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,058
Ray comes up for parole in a while.

663
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,971
Says that he can last it.

664
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,227
What do you think?

665
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,571
There's guys that can do all the
hard time the State gives them.

666
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,991
Whatever Ray had, he used up to get this far.

667
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,747
- Hi.
- Hi.

668
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,463
- I didn't think you were home.
- Why not?

669
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,166
- No car.
- I took it in for service.

670
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,093
Avery brought me home.

671
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,099
I went to the office looking for you.

672
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,471
I wasn't there.

673
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,269
Apparently not. I even looked under your desk.

674
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,978
- Yeah, I went...
- Avery told me you were at MSU,

675
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,809
at the law library.

676
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,360
- Avery did.
- Avery did.

677
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,779
But when I happened to spot
your car in the parking lot,

678
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,198
it made him kind of edgy.

679
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,618
Yeah, well, Avery didn't exactly know where I was.

680
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,282
Probably thought you were with another woman.

681
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,503
I went to see Ray.

682
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,710
Ray?

683
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,844
- Yeah.
- Just like that, after all this time?

684
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,976
You were right. I've been stupid.

685
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,231
I would have gone with you on Saturday.

686
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,685
I know. God, I just wasn't... I wasn't thinking.

687
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,742
How'd it go?

688
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,070
It was...

689
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,823
It was...

690
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,416
God, he... He tried to make it easy for me.

691
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,169
Is he okay?

692
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,298
He's gotta get that parole.

693
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,052
You want to try something?

694
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,933
Let's put the books away,

695
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,687
pretend we're back in our
old beat-up apartment, broke,

696
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,895
and we find some money we forgot in pockets.

697
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,316
- We'll send out for pizza and drink beer.
- Drink beer.

698
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,487
And watch Star Search.

699
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,661
Who knows where it will lead.

700
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,107
Your wife?

701
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,731
- She's in Cleveland.
- She lies.

702
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,825
Don't you answer your phone?

703
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,824
Don't you knock?

704
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,031
Where's your secretary?

705
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,084
Out.

706
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,663
- She left a cigarette burning.
- She does that.

707
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,592
Why don't you come back in one
hour, and make an appointment?

708
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,465
Why bother? We're here.

709
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,046
I'm busy.

710
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,715
Doing what?

711
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,801
I'm getting a pedicure.

712
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,553
What's it to you?

713
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,817
Now this is gonna turn out badly for you,

714
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,568
but we can make it relatively painless.

715
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:14,243
Why are you asking questions about dead lawyers?

716
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,035
What dead lawyers?

717
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,833
Who hired you to do that?

718
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,794
Okay! Okay.

719
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,466
Just let me think.

720
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,885
His name was Julio Iglesias.

721
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,018
No! No!

722
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,144
Great!

723
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,817
Just great.

724
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,775
You want to ask him a few questions now?

725
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,353
I think this is a carefully balanced proposal.

726
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,732
I think it's high-minded and I think it's fair-minded.

727
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,280
In other words, it's got
something in it to offend everyone.

728
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,525
If you want to follow along with me,

729
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,703
we'll begin on page "I" of the introduction.

730
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:45,414
We'll revue sections 704-B of the IRS code of 1986

731
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:50,123
and the treasury regulations
amended under Section 1/704-1.

732
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,499
Quote, "The distribution provisions

733
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,926
"in limited and general partnership agreements."

734
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,048
These regulations permit the
I RS to disregard allocations

735
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,049
which are not made in accordance

736
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,385
with partners' interests in the partnership

737
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,893
unless those allocations satisfy the economic effect

738
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,849
most easily satisfied

739
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,607
by taking advantage of the safe
harbor provisions set forth therein.

740
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,156
In other words, in an ever-changing sea of tax laws...

741
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,033
Hey, brother.

742
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,664
Brother, go down the steps towards the pool.

743
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,841
Here you go, brother.

744
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,428
- Voices from the Wall.
- Thanks a lot.

745
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,630
Oh, yeah.

746
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:40,840
Mister.

747
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,811
Who killed Eddie Lomax?

748
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,023
Go over and sit next to the man on the bench.

749
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,086
I appreciate your coming, Mr. McDeere.

750
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,547
I'll call you Mitch, if I may?

751
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,179
My name is Voyles. Denton Voyles.

752
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,851
I'm with the Department of Justice.

753
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,224
What happened to Eddie Lomax?

754
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:34,105
We've been investigating Bendini,
Lambert & Locke for four years.

755
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,022
No lawyer has ever left your law firm alive.

756
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,866
Two tried to leave, they were killed.

757
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,116
Two were about to try, you know what happened.

758
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,416
Now, we have reason to believe
that your house is bugged.

759
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:53,087
Your phones are tapped, your office is wired.

760
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,879
They may follow you, they may be
here in Washington as we speak.

761
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,222
Are you saying my life is in danger?

762
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,517
I'm saying that your life as you know it is over.

763
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,145
Your law firm is the sole legal representative

764
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,693
of the Morolto crime family in Chicago.

765
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,987
Known as the Mafia. The Mob.

766
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,566
I don't believe it.

767
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,151
They set up legitimate businesses

768
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,955
with dirty money from drugs, gambling, prostitution.

769
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,625
All cash, all moved offshore. You believe it.

770
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,453
That's why you talked to Thomas Abanks in the Caymans.

771
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,379
That's why you got this private investigator

772
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,503
asking questions that got him killed.

773
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,471
Maybe 30% of their clients are legitimate.

774
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,173
They bring in a new rookie,

775
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:50,477
throw money at him, buy the car, the house.

776
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:54,307
After a couple of years, and
your kids are in private schools,

777
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,985
you're used to the good life, they tell you the truth.

778
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,938
You mean every partner in the Firm is...

779
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,524
Every partner knows.

780
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,156
We suspect most of the associates.

781
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,374
Why don't you get indictments and bust it all up?

782
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,086
We have to have somebody on the inside.

783
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,465
We need to see copies of
contracts, clients' bank records,

784
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,671
- articles of incorporation.
- Wait a minute.

785
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,427
- You think I'm...
- You can say no.

786
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,679
But we're gonna break this firm.

787
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,059
And when that happens, you're gonna
go to jail along with the rest.

788
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,229
It will happen, son, believe me.

789
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,028
Why can't I just leave?

790
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,448
That's what Kozinski and Hodges were trying to do.

791
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,112
You have to think this over.

792
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,416
Meanwhile, you and your wife have to
behave as though everything is normal.

793
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,962
Now don't discuss this with anyone,

794
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,549
but make a decision.

795
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:06,254
If you help us, we'll make it worth your while.

796
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:07,963
Worth my while?

797
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,390
You can still have a pretty good life.

798
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,140
You mean in a witness protection program?

799
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:21,435
How? I live somebody else's life?

800
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,822
In some nowhere place, and one
day I'm backing out of my driveway

801
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,737
and my car explodes?

802
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,244
Doesn't have to be that way.

803
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:35,574
I don't need much of a life, Mr.
Voyles, but it has to be mine.

804
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,251
Is that what you've got now, son?

805
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,749
You ought to get back to the seminar.

806
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,507
Tarrance has full authority to negotiate on our behalf.

807
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,766
Why don't you wander back past the memorial?

808
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,444
You can call me in Memphis anytime, day or night.

809
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,022
The second one's a mobile number.

810
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,441
Let me get this straight.

811
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,279
I steal files from the Firm
and turn them over to the FBI.

812
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,206
Testify against my colleagues, send them to jail.

813
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,373
They suckered you into this.

814
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,952
Reveal privileged information that
violates attorney-client confidences,

815
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,631
get me disbarred, and then testify
in open court against the Mafia.

816
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,960
- Well, unfortunately, Mitch...
- Let me ask you something.

817
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,636
Are you out of your fucking mind?

818
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,640
How long before they find out Lomax's cellmate

819
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,059
was a guy named Ray McDeere?

820
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,227
And when they do, what do you think they'll do to him?

821
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,900
They can get to anyone, anywhere.

822
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,394
What can you do?

823
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,856
Your brother comes up for parole soon, doesn't he?

824
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,695
You cooperate with us, I'll
guarantee the board will be grateful.

825
01:03:55,707 --> 01:04:00,201
Otherwise... Well, you know what
those parole hearings are like.

826
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,086
It could go either way.

827
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,866
Forget about home, driver. Take me to the Firm.

828
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,944
- The employer will have...
- Mr. McDeere, you can't go in there!

829
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,700
Call everybody. Right now!

830
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,033
- I'm on overseas and I've got two...
- Right now!

831
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,118
I just had a little chat with the FBI.

832
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,802
- And they didn't try to coerce you?
- No.

833
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,970
- They didn't offer you money?
- Nope.

834
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,303
Did they ask you to contact them again?

835
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,808
What for?

836
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,270
Exactly what did they want?

837
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,812
The secret files.

838
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,824
Who had those secret files last?

839
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,242
You have them, Royce?

840
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,494
- I gave them to you.
- No.

841
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:27,337
They also suggested that Hodges
and Kozinski were murdered.

842
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,004
Those sons of bitches!

843
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,678
Now, we ought to build a case
and sue. This is pure harassment.

844
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,429
And that was it?

845
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,683
That was everything that was said?

846
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,766
Well, I mean, as far as I can remember.

847
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,273
It wasn't exactly a sequential conversation.

848
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,445
There was a lot of yelling, mostly by me.

849
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:57,117
Mitch, we're always doing battle with the government.

850
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:01,037
If it isn't the Justice Department,
it's the IRS, and you know what?

851
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,452
We beat them every time.

852
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,955
And they hate us for it.

853
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:09,708
They can't get to us so they pick on somebody new.

854
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,711
They invite you to break the law.

855
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,465
Doesn't cost them anything,
but it costs you everything.

856
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,715
Now, I don't want you to worry about this.

857
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,302
It's gotten serious enough.
We'll have to get into it legally.

858
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:28,561
I guess the only other question
is, who do we bill this hour to?

859
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,736
How about the FBI?

860
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:10,265
I can't believe that. That is so weird.

861
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,442
I was just thinking about you.

862
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,272
Somebody's burning leaves outside, did you smell it?

863
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,694
It reminded me of the time...

864
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,198
Hey!

865
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,080
If you're afraid you'll wake
the kids, we don't have any.

866
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:32,851
Abby!

867
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,446
Abby!

868
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,199
Abby!

869
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,119
- Abby!
- Don't say anything! Don't say anything!

870
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,165
Don't tell me anymore!

871
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,460
Everything.

872
01:08:55,214 --> 01:09:00,049
Every single thing we've said or
done since we've been in that house,

873
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,802
nothing has been between us.

874
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,303
Can't we just get in our own car
and drive back to Boston, tonight?

875
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,054
- We'll just leave everything.
- They'd find us.

876
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,394
How do you go to work tomorrow?
How do you look at Avery?

877
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,812
What do you say to him?

878
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,730
I talk about work.

879
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,976
- That's insane!
- I have thought of every possible way.

880
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,983
Here, in the Caymans, in
Washington, that's all I've done.

881
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:25,818
Try to think of a way out. If we run,
they'd find us, and it gets Ray killed.

882
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,244
- But if you testify...
- The FBI says they'll help Ray

883
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,743
- and protect us.
- Protect what?

884
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,419
What are you going to do?

885
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,590
Go in tomorrow and start to copy files.

886
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,208
I don't have a choice.

887
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,544
Mitch,

888
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,675
what are you saying?

889
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,757
You'll be revealing clients' secrets.

890
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,303
- You'll be disbarred.
- Abby, don't...

891
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,098
You'll never be able to practice
law again for the rest of your life.

892
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,394
Everything you've worked for!
They can't ask you to do that!

893
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,440
They are not asking!

894
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:10,283
We have to behave exactly as we have been.

895
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:15,500
We have to go to work and come home every day

896
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:20,088
and never wonder about the walls and the wires...

897
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,460
And do nothing we want to do.

898
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,641
Szechwan beef from Wong Boys.

899
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,486
That was the last time I remember laughing.

900
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,531
- Come on! Every single day we got...
- Oh, not you again, man.

901
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,400
one of your trucks out here, blocking this alley.

902
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,110
- Hey, leave me alone.
- What's it gonna take, huh?

903
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,411
Hey, would you leave me alone, buddy?

904
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,614
You're using this place as a parking lot!

905
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,613
What the hell are you doing?

906
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,415
Jesus, I was just trying to make a copy of...

907
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,129
They just started this. You have to
have the billing code for each client.

908
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,798
You mean every time I copy a
piece of paper, it's recorded?

909
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,591
What are you trying to do, kill yourself?

910
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,382
Come on. Nina should do that anyway.

911
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:54,011
Come down for one night, can't you?

912
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,893
Well, it used to be worth it.

913
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:05,398
Okay. Yeah, maybe next time.

914
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,778
Bye, Cordelia.

915
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,315
That was Cordelia.

916
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,570
Yeah. Your wife.

917
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,322
From the song of the same name.

918
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,496
Avery, I have a couple of ideas about those Capps LCs.

919
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,869
When's the next Cayman trip?

920
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,827
For me? Next week.

921
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:26,631
If you think I'm gonna let Sonny Capps
get another look at you, you're crazy.

922
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,295
But you write down every single thought you have.

923
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,759
I'll be happy to take credit.

924
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:37,259
Mr. McDeere! Mr. Mulholland's
called twice about his bills again.

925
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,353
Tell Mr. Mulholland to take his bill and...

926
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,725
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Isn't he just up the street?

927
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,728
- Yes. In the Cotton Exchange.
- Cotton Exchange.

928
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,855
Tell him I'll see him later.

929
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,858
Did you order a fried egg sandwich
from the Front Street Deli?

930
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,735
A fried egg...

931
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,497
Yes, I did. I did.

932
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,291
Come in.

933
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,581
It's $2.65. The receipt's in the bag.

934
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,801
The receipt's in the bag.

935
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,866
How did you see them, and they didn't see you?

936
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,863
I was under the desk.

937
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,880
I was vacuuming the rug. You
want me to draw you a diagram?

938
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,041
I loved him.

939
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,841
I'm sorry, Tammy.

940
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,175
They wanted to know who hired him

941
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:03,724
and why he was asking questions about dead lawyers.

942
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,564
You actually saw them?

943
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,862
One guy was stocky, looked like a wrestler.

944
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,199
He's gonna limp the rest of his life

945
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:24,495
'cause Eddie hit him in the knee
with that cannon under his desk.

946
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,707
And the other guy was like an albino.

947
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,918
Long thin hair, almost white.

948
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,215
Dead blue eyes.

949
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,681
My landlady said they came looking for me yesterday,

950
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,475
so I checked into the Motel 6 on River Street.

951
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,429
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

952
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:53,686
Listen, they're gonna put Eddie
together with Ray, and when they do,

953
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,238
it'll lead to you.

954
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:00,068
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

955
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,286
Eddie wouldn't like it.

956
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,202
So, you're in as much trouble as I am.

957
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:10,703
Listen, there's a building around
the corner called the Cotton Exchange.

958
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,288
Maybe you can help, Tammy.

959
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:17,543
Hi there, Mitch.

960
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,505
Bill Devasher, Firm Security.

961
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:25,059
Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert were telling
me about your little run in with the FBI.

962
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,853
I wonder if we could have a little talk.

963
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,931
Actually, I told them everything.

964
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,979
I'm sure you did. This won't take a minute.

965
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,984
Hop in.

966
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,642
So, Mitch, this is a debriefing.

967
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,940
I know pretty much what you told the fellows,

968
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,321
so I kind of got the picture.

969
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,287
Now it's my job to give you the picture.

970
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,160
What I'm concerned about, son, is this.

971
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,126
The FBI wouldn't have come after you
if they didn't figure they'd get to you.

972
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,374
What do you suppose made them think that?

973
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:35,872
I have no idea.

974
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,841
Well, see, it's my job to have an idea about that.

975
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,382
For example, they might know how
important your young wife is to you.

976
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,346
They might use that.

977
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,677
How?

978
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,766
Avery says last Friday you took the afternoon off.

979
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,224
He figures you might have been with another woman.

980
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,477
- Why would Avery think...
- How do you know

981
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,027
you weren't followed?

982
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,490
Picture Abby one day walking to the mail box,

983
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:12,200
anticipating the arrival of her
Redbook, her Sharper Image catalog.

984
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,711
What does she find instead?

985
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,751
She finds heartache, Mitch.

986
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,208
The death of love and trust.

987
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,045
Imagine her one day opening that.

988
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,218
Go ahead. Take a look.

989
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,553
Devastating.

990
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,777
Not just screwing, Mitch.

991
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:45,699
But the kind of intimate acts, oral and whatnot,

992
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,237
that can be particularly hard for
a trusting young wife to forgive

993
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,456
and impossible to forget.

994
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,009
That's just the kind of stuff the
FBI could use for coercion, Mitch.

995
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,086
So you watch yourself.

996
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,798
I'll do the best I can to protect you,

997
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,426
and I know you will do your best to protect the Firm.

998
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:16,977
So if the FBI so much as spits in your direction,

999
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,818
you'll let me know before it
hits the ground, won't you?

1000
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:24,484
Won't you, Mitch?

1001
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:38,206
Oliver wants to see you right now
in the library. Where you been?

1002
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,412
Let me just put my coat away.

1003
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,792
Right now. He's been waiting.

1004
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,135
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

1005
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,307
Well, we've been informed there's somebody smarter.

1006
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:05,105
You didn't get the highest score on the bar exam,

1007
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,781
you got the second-highest score.

1008
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,864
Cheers!

1009
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,121
Nice one.

1010
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,995
Congratulations.

1011
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,420
They called you, huh?

1012
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,464
Guilty, Your Honor.

1013
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:25,961
I did it.

1014
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:29,336
Well, it's your moment of glory.

1015
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:35,350
You know, my wife missed mine,
and she never forgave herself.

1016
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,304
I wouldn't want that to happen to you.

1017
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,015
- That's very considerate, Avery.
- Well, I thought so.

1018
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,142
Well done. Well done.

1019
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,193
- Quite an achievement, Mitch.
- Abby.

1020
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,528
Well, the space is just great. I'll take it.

1021
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,118
- And the lease would be under...
- Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1022
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,786
And you are...

1023
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,206
- Doris Greenwood. I like that suit a lot.
- Well, thank you.

1024
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,542
They're gonna deliver a copier tomorrow.

1025
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,037
- I'll make sure the office is open.
- All right.

1026
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:15,222
I will employ such means only as
are consistent with truth and honor.

1027
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:20,016
I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate

1028
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,439
the secrets of my client.

1029
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,811
I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate

1030
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,317
the secrets of my client.

1031
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:35,244
I will truly and honestly conduct
myself in the practice of my profession

1032
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,866
to the best of my skill and ability, so help me God.

1033
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,923
"I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate

1034
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,096
"the secrets of my client"?

1035
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:03,101
The first thing I'm gonna do is
violate the secrets of my clients.

1036
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,267
Do you see any other way?

1037
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,568
Okay, then. Aren't we doing the best we can?

1038
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,452
No.

1039
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,249
What do you mean?

1040
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,008
I can't.

1041
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,762
What?

1042
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,106
That...

1043
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:53,196
That night...

1044
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,485
That night in the Caymans when you telephoned...

1045
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,532
You were on the beach.

1046
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,338
What?

1047
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,672
What did you do?

1048
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,846
No.

1049
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,512
You didn't...

1050
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,200
Who was she?

1051
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,668
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1052
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,542
I don't even know her name.

1053
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,801
It didn't mean anything.

1054
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:59,881
Like hell it didn't. It means everything.

1055
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,723
What did you do?

1056
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:07,475
Why did you fuck some stranger
on a beach one night away from me?

1057
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,646
Who does that?

1058
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,770
- Abby, I promise you...
- What?

1059
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:16,439
You can't promise anything. Not ever. Not anymore.

1060
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,742
Why did you tell me?

1061
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,072
Because I couldn't stand not to.

1062
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:30,252
I couldn't stand your not knowing.

1063
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,382
Well, now I know.

1064
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,102
Give me the keys.

1065
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,438
Sorry, I...

1066
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,774
Just give me the keys.

1067
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,283
I thought there were only two Brothers Grimm.

1068
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,451
Sit down, Avery.

1069
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,621
Anthony and Joey are coming down next week.

1070
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,963
- What for?
- Works out your proteges got a brother.

1071
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,081
So?

1072
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,508
He didn't mention him at the interview in Boston.

1073
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,343
I've got a brother I might not mention either

1074
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,760
- in polite conversation.
- This brother's doing time.

1075
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,056
How did you find that out?

1076
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,429
What do you think I am here, a fucking night watchman?

1077
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,102
I get confused sometimes.

1078
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,646
- Well, don't!
- All right, Avery.

1079
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:37,395
We got a prison guard in Arkansas. He's on the arm.

1080
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:41,983
He tells us about a Ray McDeere
doing time for manslaughter.

1081
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,532
The Moroltos have been edgy ever
since the Kozinski and Hodges mess.

1082
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:48,872
They're concerned that we might be misreading McDeere.

1083
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,241
And the Moroltos are coming for what?

1084
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,747
- To personally take over?
- Are we misreading him?

1085
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,079
I don't think so.

1086
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:59,166
Wouldn't you lie if you had a felon
in the family to get a job like this?

1087
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,090
I still think we ought to keep
him on a pretty tight leash.

1088
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,638
Why? You've got nothing to be suspicious about.

1089
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:09,639
I get paid to be suspicious when I
got nothing to be suspicious about.

1090
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,099
Excuse me.

1091
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,865
You're not listening, Mr. McDeere.

1092
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,123
I'm sorry. You were talking about hours?

1093
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:03,207
Listen, I know I'm not
Bendini-Lambert's most valuable client,

1094
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,633
but I've got a legitimate complaint here.

1095
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,471
You never spent 33 hours last month on my account.

1096
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:10,889
Is that what you were billed?

1097
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,887
You don't see your own bills?

1098
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,562
No, I just submit my time sheet.

1099
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,058
Where is it?

1100
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,983
It's on file with the office manager.

1101
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:24,729
You know, this overbilling's gotten so common

1102
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,485
nobody gives it another thought.

1103
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,316
It's kind of like tipping.

1104
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,320
Well, it's not policy, Mr. Mulholland.

1105
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:36,748
It sure seems like policy. It's
been going on over there for years.

1106
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:40,168
People forget something else, too.

1107
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:45,007
When somebody over there put
a stamp on this and mailed it,

1108
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,674
you know what happened?

1109
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,923
- It became a federal offense.
- It became a federal offense.

1110
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,754
You're damn right.

1111
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,181
Each instance punishable by...

1112
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,099
$ 10,000 fine.

1113
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,849
Three to five years each instance.

1114
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:24,542
Nina, I'm going over to
Mulholland's for a half hour or so.

1115
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:25,998
All righty.

1116
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,383
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- I got the beeper.

1117
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,134
I think there might be a way of doing this

1118
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,557
without getting disbarred and without breaking the law.

1119
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,135
Is that our chief concern here?

1120
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,313
Tear those up. I might not have to use them.

1121
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,233
But I got to get to that stuff in the Caymans.

1122
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,981
What, for the FBI?

1123
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,482
No. For me.

1124
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,531
They won't let you go, you said.

1125
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,326
Somebody's gonna have to get to it another way.

1126
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,368
It has to happen fast.

1127
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,079
I got to figure out what to do about Ray.

1128
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:02,417
What?

1129
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:09,921
In Eddie's stuff, is there some
kind of wireless recording device?

1130
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,342
Yes. Yes!

1131
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,170
You know how to use it?

1132
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,007
Whenever Eddie said, "My associate"? Yours truly.

1133
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,512
Did he have any high-speed camera equipment?

1134
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,845
- Sure.
- I want you to get hold of a van, Tammy.

1135
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:56,463
Hey, Tammy, did Elvis ever find out about Eddie?

1136
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,809
Oh, man. He loved Eddie. Are you kidding?

1137
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,647
Hell, that stuff was over between
me and Elvis when I was 18.

1138
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,565
We'd been married two years,

1139
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,486
and one morning at breakfast
I just turned too old for him.

1140
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:15,407
But I tell you, everybody
loves Elvis. The man's a panda.

1141
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,903
And he'd do anything for me.

1142
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,907
They're off, and Say Something comes away on top

1143
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,239
and Right There is stepping over on the inside.

1144
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,824
Champagne Now rushes up...

1145
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,251
Doesn't a dog ever get the bone?

1146
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,579
Yeah, I hear it happens once
in a while. It's a disaster.

1147
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,164
They can never get that dog to run again.

1148
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:33,587
Listen, Mitch,

1149
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,760
Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you
how much the Bureau appreciates...

1150
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:39,431
A million dollars in a numbered account in Switzerland.

1151
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,427
IBG Bank International in Zurich.

1152
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,850
Well, you sure as hell turned greedy overnight.

1153
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:49,269
And my brother out. Now.

1154
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:52,019
Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch.

1155
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,113
Then get yourself another snitch.

1156
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,861
He's in for manslaughter.

1157
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,529
It was a brawl in a bar.

1158
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,948
If he hadn't done any boxing,
it would have been self-defense.

1159
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,449
It's still a felony, Mitch.

1160
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,031
You heard me, Tarrance. My brother out now.

1161
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,287
And make it a million and a half.

1162
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,461
How about you get down on your knees and kiss my ass

1163
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,458
for not indicting you as a co-conspirator right now,

1164
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,210
you chicken shit little Harvard cocksucker!

1165
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,882
I haven't done anything, and you know it!

1166
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,217
Who gives a fuck? I'm a federal agent.

1167
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,885
You know what that means, you low life mother fucker?

1168
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,463
You got no rights. Your life is mine.

1169
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,889
I could kick your teeth down your
throat, yank them out your asshole

1170
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,384
and I'm not even violating your civil rights.

1171
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,892
- You are Agent Wayne Tarrance.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right I am!

1172
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,310
Maybe local cops can't...

1173
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,742
- Yeah.
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?

1174
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,911
- Who is this?
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?

1175
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,329
Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.

1176
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,906
So is this.

1177
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,077
cocksucker!

1178
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,825
I haven't done anything, and you know it!

1179
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,251
Who gives a fuck? I'm a federal agent.

1180
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:51,748
You know what that means, you low life motherfucker?

1181
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,337
You got no rights. Your life is mine.

1182
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,757
I could kick your teeth down your
throat, yank them out your asshole

1183
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:58,547
and I'm not even violating your civil rights.

1184
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:04,508
Now, I think you ought to reconsider.

1185
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:32,536
I think I might have found a way out.

1186
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:39,631
Not out, exactly. It's more like a way through.

1187
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:46,099
It's a long shot, but it's... Well, it's legal.

1188
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:55,483
I know it's weird, but if we follow
the law, it just might save us.

1189
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,238
You don't want to hear the plan.

1190
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,162
Would it change anything between us?

1191
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,076
It's just a plan.

1192
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,755
I can't do this anymore.

1193
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,084
I can't help you here. I can't help myself.

1194
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,673
I've given notice at the school.
I'll leave after the break Wednesday.

1195
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:49,204
You're right. It's better if you go, safer.

1196
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,043
- You have no idea...
- Don't!

1197
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:07,839
- I love you, Abby.
- Don't you dare, you son of a bitch!

1198
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,733
You want to tell me your plan?

1199
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,322
Tomorrow.

1200
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,695
Abby, where are you gonna go?

1201
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,413
To my parents, first. After that, I don't know.

1202
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:44,926
It might not be safe for you to
leave, unless they know why...

1203
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,096
I know. I know.

1204
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,847
Somewhere inside,

1205
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:56,100
in the dark,

1206
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,432
a Firm is listening.

1207
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:07,779
Shall we go in now and do this for the record?

1208
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,708
I've made a decision.

1209
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:28,386
My mother hasn't been well, she's having some tests.

1210
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:33,300
I want to be there. We never see each other, anyway.

1211
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,143
And I need some time to think.

1212
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:40,064
Call Devasher. She's leaving him.

1213
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:46,396
Knock, knock.

1214
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:49,820
Bad times, huh?

1215
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,325
Abby called Kay.

1216
01:35:56,793 --> 01:36:01,002
Listen, all the wives go a little nuts the first year.

1217
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:04,172
She'll be back.

1218
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,591
Probably want to get pregnant.

1219
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:15,016
Big help, huh?

1220
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,350
You think I'm gonna let this kid

1221
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,598
tell us how to run the penal system in this country?

1222
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,353
Sir, it's the only way he'll give us the files.

1223
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,771
Then stall on the money.

1224
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:27,023
Get the brother out with a federal subpoena.

1225
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,949
Follow him and the minute we
get the files, yank him back.

1226
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,863
Abanks' Dive Lodge.

1227
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,200
Mr. Thomas Abanks, please. This is Mitch McDeere.

1228
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,641
Sorry, Dutch, but I've got to justify a
client's bill before a breakfast meeting

1229
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:08,228
and all the time sheets and bills are
locked up in the office manager's office.

1230
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:09,900
I don't know if I'm really supposed to do this for you.

1231
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,898
Hey, you want to wake up Avery?

1232
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:17,074
I'm just trying to head off a legal action against us.

1233
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:21,909
I promise, I'll have everything back
in the drawer before the office opens.

1234
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:55,446
You're taller than I thought.

1235
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,948
That's nice to hear.

1236
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:00,413
There's been a change of plan.

1237
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,708
I didn't know there was a plan.

1238
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,252
Good, because it's been changed.

1239
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,962
Who are you, sweetheart?

1240
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,637
Abanks' Diving Lodge.

1241
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,635
What time has Avery chartered the boat for?

1242
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,053
2:30.

1243
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:24,225
Okay, now, you got to keep him out long
enough to copy everything in that closet.

1244
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,476
Don't worry. My friends are
taking him to Trinity Caves.

1245
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,565
- It should be a good six hours.
- Okay.

1246
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,816
Tammy's coming down tomorrow to set things up.

1247
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,457
I can... I can whip us up some eggs.

1248
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,999
Last day, I don't want to be late for school.

1249
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:02,265
Has Tammy left to meet Abanks?

1250
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,344
Not until this evening.

1251
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:10,771
You're running a real 3-ring circus, aren't you?

1252
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,943
- I hope it goes well.
- It has to.

1253
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,870
You know, isn't it amazing?

1254
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:27,792
You did the cheating, and I'm the one who feels guilty.

1255
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,119
Don't.

1256
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:40,505
Take care of yourself.

1257
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,223
Hey! Hey! Stop that!

1258
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:51,398
Where are your gloves?

1259
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,819
Get back to the dodge ball game. You, too, Sheila.

1260
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:09,200
Boys and girls together, rehearsing for later life.

1261
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,411
What are you doing here?

1262
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:14,163
Would you believe I just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

1263
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,418
No.

1264
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:19,006
I heard this was your last day.

1265
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,671
Was I misinformed?

1266
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,015
I'll be gone for a while.

1267
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:27,844
I just stopped off to say goodbye.

1268
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,271
- Just in case.
- In case what?

1269
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,187
In case it's more than a while.

1270
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:38,567
I'm going to the Caymans tomorrow,
and I would miss saying goodbye.

1271
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:43,360
Well, thank you. Have a nice trip.

1272
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,785
Want to come?

1273
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:49,624
I know. I know, it sounds outrageous,

1274
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,584
but think about it.

1275
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:58,042
We could grab some sun, take
a dip, drink some Havana Club.

1276
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,636
I could give you marital advice and hit on you,

1277
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,308
and whatever happens, I promise I take rejection well.

1278
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:11,478
What makes you think I need marital advice?

1279
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:14,098
Okay, you give me marital advice.

1280
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,402
I couldn't possibly.

1281
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:23,570
- I don't scuba dive.
- Perfect. I can't scuba dive either.

1282
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:24,992
Really?

1283
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,321
I'd heard that you don't miss a chance to...

1284
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:29,822
Not this time.

1285
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:32,746
I had to shorten the trip, clients coming into town.

1286
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,421
I can't dive and fly in the same 24 hours. So, you see?

1287
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,339
How about it?

1288
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,836
My mother isn't well.

1289
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:46,514
They're doing some tests.

1290
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,680
That's why I'm going home.

1291
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,137
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1292
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,106
How could you possibly?

1293
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:01,320
I hope she feels better, and
if she does, bring her with you.

1294
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:08,035
Goodbye, Avery. Have a good flight.

1295
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,372
Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1296
01:42:19,508 --> 01:42:22,716
Tammy, this is Abby McDeere. I
think you've got a serious problem.

1297
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,839
Avery's not going diving.

1298
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,214
We're dead.

1299
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:33,219
Well, how do we...

1300
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,898
How am I gonna tell Mitch? How am I gonna let him know?

1301
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,322
I'm going anyway. I've got to try to do something.

1302
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,870
My flight's in three hours.

1303
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,250
Mr. McDeere's office.

1304
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:02,748
I'm sorry, he's not in. May I take a message?

1305
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,602
Tammy, don't tell Mitch anything.

1306
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:28,695
I'll just be a sec.

1307
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:32,737
A prescription for Abigail McDeere.

1308
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:50,637
One!

1309
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:57,144
Well, you want to go, or do you want to stay here?

1310
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:00,644
- Aren't you gonna cuff him?
- I'll take care of it.

1311
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,237
Yeah?

1312
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,492
Guess what I'm looking at?

1313
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,249
Tell me.

1314
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,332
My first sunset in six years.

1315
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,339
- You made it.
- Yeah.

1316
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:29,251
Yeah, I did.

1317
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,507
I owe you, little brother.

1318
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,931
No, you don't.

1319
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:41,014
- Anything from Abanks?
- Last I heard, everything was set.

1320
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,937
It's gonna be fine.

1321
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,860
It already is.

1322
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,282
I'll be seeing you, Ray.

1323
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,780
Okay, you spoke to him. Now, where are the files?

1324
01:44:56,874 --> 01:44:58,114
Where's the money?

1325
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,699
Not until I get the files.

1326
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:01,534
You send half now.

1327
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:05,788
Account number 6194408S. You got that?

1328
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,384
Yeah. 6194408S, yeah.

1329
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,968
When I get confirmation it's
there, I'll send the files.

1330
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,566
Here's some pocket money.

1331
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:29,312
You're free, McDeere. There's
a bus stop a quarter mile.

1332
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:32,398
Follow the yellow line. You're used to that.

1333
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:20,825
Excuse me.

1334
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:42,180
You don't seem that surprised.

1335
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,182
I'm deeply surprised.

1336
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,351
So am I.

1337
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:01,654
Stephanie, could we have two Havana Club, please?

1338
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,330
Yes, Mr. Tolar.

1339
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:20,347
How'd the test turn out?

1340
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,050
We were worried for no reason.

1341
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:24,347
Good.

1342
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:30,186
I didn't think we'd got on
that well in the school yard.

1343
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,277
Maybe I've grown up since then.

1344
01:47:34,365 --> 01:47:36,447
I'd love to believe that.

1345
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,884
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?

1346
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,712
It's like cognac.

1347
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,387
You know, I have a very bad reputation.

1348
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,139
- What do you do?
- I run around.

1349
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,274
Why do you do that?

1350
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,232
I think it's because my wife understands me.

1351
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,409
The fact is, I love my wife.

1352
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:34,084
But she's... Well, I guess she's lost interest in me.

1353
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,415
I know I have.

1354
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:43,672
And I haven't cared for anyone since.

1355
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:48,434
I'd like to, though.

1356
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,180
I miss it.

1357
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:59,981
My, you lay a lot on a girl for a first date.

1358
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:03,449
Is that what this is?

1359
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:13,748
This is Unit B.

1360
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:17,878
We'll be pulling into Five Points
at 11:15 for a 20-minute rest stop.

1361
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,959
Mrs. Sunderland, I'm sorry to call you at home so late,

1362
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:23,046
but I need to speak to you
about something that's, well,

1363
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,676
it's really quite embarrassing.

1364
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,345
Let me preface this by saying you're
not the only client at the Firm

1365
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:28,558
that I've had to call about this.

1366
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:43,880
I'd like a big steak, medium
rare, three fried eggs over,

1367
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:46,383
French fries and coffee, please.

1368
01:50:50,894 --> 01:50:53,476
I'll see you, darling.

1369
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:04,456
Fuck!

1370
01:52:21,526 --> 01:52:23,938
What the hell is going on? We lost your brother.

1371
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:26,190
Why, were you following him?

1372
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:28,279
Are you trying to fuck with me?

1373
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,777
Where are you? Where are those files?

1374
01:52:29,868 --> 01:52:33,326
Are you trying to fuck with me? You
want the files, you wire the money.

1375
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:34,991
I want those files now.

1376
01:52:35,123 --> 01:52:36,954
Got to go, Wayne.

1377
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:42,123
He knows exactly where his brother is.

1378
01:52:43,215 --> 01:52:44,705
Have them check all the credit cards

1379
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:48,379
of everybody that got fuel outside
that diner between 11:00 and 11:45,

1380
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,753
whenever we lost Ray.

1381
01:52:50,847 --> 01:52:52,132
There couldn't be more than a dozen or so.

1382
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,135
He's got to be on one of them.

1383
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,558
And get me a map of Louisiana.

1384
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:00,346
Get me a map of Louisiana!

1385
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,556
It hasn't even begun to melt.

1386
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,105
The staff was chosen for its timing.

1387
01:54:35,577 --> 01:54:38,489
I would do that, but I could never do that.

1388
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:42,117
The buttons are too small.

1389
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:46,577
It requires terrible...

1390
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:48,161
Dexterity.

1391
01:54:50,926 --> 01:54:52,632
Amazing.

1392
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:06,096
What are you doing here?

1393
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:07,806
What do you mean?

1394
01:55:07,943 --> 01:55:10,559
I mean, exactly what did you come here for?

1395
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:12,815
I thought I was invited.

1396
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,359
You're not being truthful.

1397
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:19,985
Why are you doing this?

1398
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:25,040
Because I'm sick and I want you to tell me the truth.

1399
01:55:27,003 --> 01:55:31,167
I came here to punish Mitch for
letting the Firm ruin our lives.

1400
01:55:32,509 --> 01:55:36,127
I came because when Mitch was here
with you he slept with someone else.

1401
01:55:36,221 --> 01:55:38,553
Is that what you want to hear?

1402
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:47,304
That's better than the alternative.

1403
01:55:48,024 --> 01:55:49,764
What alternative?

1404
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:53,151
That you came here to see me.

1405
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,464
Avery?

1406
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,918
It came in about three hours ago.

1407
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:01,674
You sure he'll be all right?

1408
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,926
What the hell you want to do? Call 911?

1409
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:07,509
Get the key, grab the stuff and get over here.

1410
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,094
Keep calling him.

1411
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:12,272
Wake the son of a bitch up. When
you get him on the phone, find me.

1412
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,435
I want that girl.

1413
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:23,525
The account number is 6194408S.

1414
01:57:25,121 --> 01:57:28,454
And can you confirm that it is $ 750,000?

1415
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,262
Absolutely. I'm fixing to get out of here now.

1416
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,556
You got all the information I need?

1417
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:57,893
Yeah, but, Mitch...

1418
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:02,152
I've been looking at this stuff
and there's no numbers listed.

1419
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:04,483
There's no numbers? No amounts?

1420
01:58:04,578 --> 01:58:06,569
No, I got papers for bank accounts everywhere

1421
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:10,155
from the Caymans to Hong Kong, but there's no amounts.

1422
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,584
I can't play the poker game I'm gonna play and bluff.

1423
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:17,162
I gotta know how much they have and where.

1424
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:20,169
There's a note on each one that says,

1425
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:24,503
"Info held by client and my Mac. Signed A.T."

1426
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,506
Is there any other information? Is there a password?

1427
01:58:27,642 --> 01:58:30,008
Some kind of password? Just look on the paper, Tammy.

1428
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:31,764
Wait a minute.

1429
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:35,097
On the side of one, in parenthesis it says,

1430
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:39,685
"R-E-F," then a colon, then, "Cordelia."

1431
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:43,359
Okay, okay, I've got to get to Avery's
computer in the morning before I leave.

1432
01:58:43,491 --> 01:58:44,776
Well, listen, be careful.

1433
01:58:44,868 --> 01:58:47,280
We don't know how this is
all gonna look in the morning.

1434
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,531
I should be able to get through the morning fine.

1435
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:52,371
By the time they notice I'm not
back from lunch, I'll be in Chicago.

1436
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:03,629
Okay. We're finished. That's it.
I gotta get these out to the boat.

1437
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,335
The boat?

1438
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,970
- What boat?
- Oh, man.

1439
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:11,967
Later on there's some stuff I gotta
tell you about what Mitch is doing.

1440
01:59:12,062 --> 01:59:13,393
Tell me now, Tammy. What?

1441
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,643
Get the damn keys back in his pants
and get out of there before he wakes up.

1442
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:37,788
Hello?

1443
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,541
You have to repeat that.

1444
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:50,258
That's not possible.

1445
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:53,342
She stole your keys and God knows what else.

1446
01:59:53,978 --> 01:59:56,060
Now who the hell is she?

1447
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:59,105
You know me,

1448
01:59:59,192 --> 02:00:01,478
just somebody I met last night.

1449
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:04,276
Then how the hell does she know to go after your keys?

1450
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:07,948
The guys will be landing in about
10 minutes and she better be there.

1451
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:41,940
Don't.

1452
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:46,395
They heard you on the phone.

1453
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:52,609
Mitch sent you.

1454
02:00:57,584 --> 02:00:59,825
I knew he was a closet idealist.

1455
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:02,001
He doesn't know I'm here.

1456
02:01:03,965 --> 02:01:06,047
But I did do it for him.

1457
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,877
That's even better than getting even with him.

1458
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:14,255
You gotta get out of here.

1459
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:23,063
What are you going to do?

1460
02:01:23,151 --> 02:01:25,517
Abby, the girl was a set-up.

1461
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,692
On the beach, she was a set-up.

1462
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,776
They do things like that.

1463
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:38,572
Just in case the usual inducements don't work.

1464
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:44,127
What's going to happen? What
are they going to do to you?

1465
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:46,170
Whatever it is...

1466
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,796
They did it a long time ago.

1467
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,011
Get this thing out of here, will you?

1468
02:01:54,098 --> 02:01:56,305
Look, this ain't your cotton
truck, and this ain't your alley!

1469
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:58,599
I'm calling in to the Department of Traffic right now!

1470
02:01:58,686 --> 02:01:59,892
They call?

1471
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:01,435
Not yet.

1472
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:07,517
Madge, I just talked to Avery in the Caymans.

1473
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:09,773
He needs some work done on
the Kemmer papers before 10:00.

1474
02:02:09,864 --> 02:02:12,025
I'll just get it off his computer.

1475
02:02:17,163 --> 02:02:18,403
What the hell's the matter with you guys?

1476
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,659
This thing's out of paper.

1477
02:02:37,976 --> 02:02:39,341
McDeere in yet?

1478
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:41,721
Check every goddamn floor and find him.

1479
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:43,519
That son of a bitch cut a deal.

1480
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:57,992
- Natisin, Earlywine, Hemphill.
- Hemphill?

1481
02:02:58,454 --> 02:02:59,785
Wait a minute. That's Lomax's secretary.

1482
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:02,990
Wayne, it's Warden Dynehart from Wrightsville prison.

1483
02:03:04,168 --> 02:03:06,705
Wayne, we've got a problem here.
I've just been questioning a guard

1484
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:09,458
who sent an unauthorized fax to a law firm in Memphis

1485
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,505
and I think it was in regard to your prisoner.

1486
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:14,460
No! No, no, no, no!

1487
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:26,642
No, he's not in his office, Your
Honor. I'll see if he's in the building.

1488
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:33,110
- Thank you, Madge.
- You're welcome.

1489
02:03:33,197 --> 02:03:34,562
Mitch...

1490
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:38,279
We've just been looking for you.

1491
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,948
Can you step in here, please?

1492
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:47,834
Mr. Tolar's office. Yes, he's
right here. Nina, transfer him.

1493
02:03:47,921 --> 02:03:51,505
Mr. McDeere, a Judge Tarrance for you.

1494
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,128
One moment please.

1495
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:09,347
Hello?

1496
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:12,149
Get out of there. They know. Get out.

1497
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:17,652
Did you hear what I said? Get out
of there and get over here now.

1498
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,652
Can you?

1499
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,781
I understand.

1500
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:32,457
Come on.

1501
02:04:36,427 --> 02:04:39,965
He ain't going nowhere. Rudy, get to the front door.

1502
02:04:52,652 --> 02:04:56,315
Mitch, what can I do you for? Have a seat.

1503
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,827
Okay, Rudy, he's headed east up the alley.

1504
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,788
Get him and hold him.

1505
02:05:21,431 --> 02:05:23,171
God damn it. I knew they wouldn't find her.

1506
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:26,599
Now, I need him here now, so
you get him back on that plane.

1507
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:30,895
If we don't get McDeere before he
gives what he got to the feds...

1508
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,222
Well, what direction was he running?

1509
02:05:32,316 --> 02:05:33,351
- Wayne...
- Just a minute.

1510
02:05:33,443 --> 02:05:34,979
It's McDeere!

1511
02:05:36,946 --> 02:05:38,277
Where are you?

1512
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:39,979
Never mind. What happened?

1513
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:43,066
Look. It's okay. I'll send you a car.

1514
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,072
You just come on in. I'll tell you when you get here.

1515
02:05:45,163 --> 02:05:47,245
No, you tell me now!

1516
02:05:47,331 --> 02:05:49,868
Mitch, it was a prison guard.

1517
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:51,495
You just come on in.

1518
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:53,702
Come on in and we'll place you in protective custody.

1519
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,627
Somehow you don't make me feel protected.

1520
02:05:55,715 --> 02:05:58,081
Are you looking to get whacked?
Do you know what's going on here?

1521
02:05:58,176 --> 02:05:59,837
The Moroltos are arriving today.

1522
02:05:59,927 --> 02:06:01,463
- From Chicago.
- What?

1523
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:03,510
I got their itinerary right in front of me.

1524
02:06:03,598 --> 02:06:06,010
The Moroltos are coming here, Memphis, this afternoon.

1525
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:09,263
I got the itinerary right in front
of me. Northwest, arrives 2: 16 p. m.

1526
02:06:09,353 --> 02:06:10,718
Straight to the Peabody.

1527
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:13,270
Now, listen to me, the whole goddamn
world is gonna be looking for you.

1528
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:16,941
You can't go home, you can't go
back there, so get in here. Now!

1529
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:25,362
I've got to get lost for a few hours.

1530
02:06:25,453 --> 02:06:27,159
There's something I gotta do.

1531
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:28,531
Where the hell are the files, Mitch?

1532
02:06:28,623 --> 02:06:31,080
You'll get instructions.

1533
02:06:31,167 --> 02:06:32,953
- After.
- After what?

1534
02:06:40,134 --> 02:06:41,544
He's withholding evidence.

1535
02:06:41,636 --> 02:06:44,218
He's got three quarters of a
million dollars of our money.

1536
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:47,047
He's a fugitive. I want him brought in.

1537
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:50,258
Use the Memphis police if you have to, but get him.

1538
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:54,346
It's a red KW 10-ton registered
to a Farley's Catfish Farm.

1539
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,057
Get its routes and find that truck.

1540
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:00,894
And issue APBs on Ray and Mitchell McDeere.

1541
02:07:19,048 --> 02:07:22,961
During the great steamboat era,
which was at its height in the 1870's,

1542
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:25,759
these great floating palaces, like the Robert E Lee,

1543
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:28,589
whose model you see here, numbered by the hundreds

1544
02:07:28,683 --> 02:07:30,219
on the Mississippi River.

1545
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:32,721
The Robert E. Lee was actually designed specifically

1546
02:07:32,812 --> 02:07:35,849
to travel on the Mississippi
River, which is a shallow river...

1547
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:43,896
Follow me now to the main deck of the
boat where the cargo would be carried

1548
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,776
as well as the deck passengers.

1549
02:07:45,867 --> 02:07:48,233
The great rollers that powered the steam engine

1550
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:50,739
were situated here on the main deck of the boat.

1551
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:52,786
Hey, Mitch. Mitch!

1552
02:07:52,874 --> 02:07:56,287
The end of the great steam era
and the advent of the railway.

1553
02:07:56,377 --> 02:07:58,208
The next gallery detailing...

1554
02:08:01,465 --> 02:08:05,253
We have here the working steam engine
off the US Army Corps of Engineers

1555
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:07,255
snag boat, the Arkansas II.

1556
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:08,756
Now a steam engine works

1557
02:08:08,848 --> 02:08:12,432
by lighting a fire underneath the
boilers where the water is contained.

1558
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:14,804
This heats the water and turns it into steam.

1559
02:08:14,896 --> 02:08:17,888
Because the kids wanted me to bring them by.

1560
02:08:18,482 --> 02:08:20,723
Why, what's the matter?

1561
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:24,527
Okay. Oh, Lamar, I just saw Mitch at Mud Island Museum.

1562
02:08:24,614 --> 02:08:26,445
He was zipping through like a tourist.

1563
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,113
I waved to him but he didn't see me.

1564
02:09:02,151 --> 02:09:07,271
Northwest Airlines Flight 264 arriving from Chicago,

1565
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:10,823
Gate B-1, main concourse.

1566
02:09:15,706 --> 02:09:16,741
- Devasher.
- Sir,

1567
02:09:16,832 --> 02:09:18,538
they spotted McDeere on Mud Island.

1568
02:09:18,668 --> 02:09:20,533
Get the boys over there, right away!

1569
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,410
I'm on my way.

1570
02:09:25,049 --> 02:09:28,416
Okay. Let's get these below with the rest of them.

1571
02:09:31,847 --> 02:09:34,429
- Abanks' Diving Lodge.
- How are my friends?

1572
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,716
Okay.

1573
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,929
Your brother's on the plane and
Tammy's loading the ship now.

1574
02:09:44,694 --> 02:09:46,230
It worked out.

1575
02:09:47,863 --> 02:09:50,070
Your lawyer friend is dead.

1576
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:54,575
He never was on the boat. He canceled the charter.

1577
02:09:56,706 --> 02:09:58,822
- Well, how did...
- He drowned.

1578
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:01,953
In his bathtub. After the lady left.

1579
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:03,955
Didn't Tammy tell you?

1580
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:07,038
What lady?

1581
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:10,333
- How did you get...
- I don't know.

1582
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:13,841
A lady friend of Tammy's slipped
him some kind of Mickey Finn.

1583
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,887
I think it was somebody he knew.

1584
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,552
What are you talking about? What lady friend?

1585
02:10:20,646 --> 02:10:21,806
Wait a minute.

1586
02:10:21,897 --> 02:10:25,890
Mitch is asking about your
friend Abby. Isn't that her name?

1587
02:11:06,233 --> 02:11:07,518
Hey!

1588
02:12:11,048 --> 02:12:12,504
Excuse me.

1589
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,861
Come here.

1590
02:14:02,952 --> 02:14:06,035
He's in that first door. I'm going around the front.

1591
02:16:54,289 --> 02:16:57,577
You sick son of a bitch!

1592
02:17:29,032 --> 02:17:31,523
Well, of course I can talk.
Why, isn't that what I'm doing?

1593
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:33,867
I mean, if it's something
else, please advise me, Maury.

1594
02:17:33,996 --> 02:17:37,033
I always like to learn something
I don't know at $500 an hour.

1595
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:39,578
I swear to you, Joey, every fucking
lawyer on the face of the earth

1596
02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:41,249
ought to be killed.

1597
02:17:41,336 --> 02:17:44,373
You want to what? You want to meet with McDeere?

1598
02:17:44,506 --> 02:17:47,748
For what? So the two of you can get
together and charge me $ 1,000 an hour

1599
02:17:47,843 --> 02:17:49,925
while they send me to Joliet for 30 years?

1600
02:17:50,012 --> 02:17:51,627
Stay in Chicago, Maury.

1601
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:54,213
This kid's cut a deal and I bet it's a beaut.

1602
02:17:54,349 --> 02:17:57,136
If I get my hands on this fucking kid,
Joey, if I get my hands on this kid...

1603
02:17:57,227 --> 02:17:59,013
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Ruthie.

1604
02:17:59,104 --> 02:18:01,390
I think it's urgent, Mr. Morolto.

1605
02:18:01,523 --> 02:18:03,104
Ruthie thinks it's urgent. What do you think, Joey?

1606
02:18:03,192 --> 02:18:05,023
It's a Mr. McDeere.

1607
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:07,525
Mr. Mitchell McDeere.

1608
02:18:08,864 --> 02:18:10,900
He's waiting to see you.

1609
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:14,734
I think Ruth is right.

1610
02:18:39,394 --> 02:18:40,850
I'm Mitch McDeere.

1611
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:45,017
I'm your attorney.

1612
02:18:45,776 --> 02:18:47,687
One of them, anyway.

1613
02:18:48,695 --> 02:18:52,563
I assume you knew, but I
thought I'd mention it, in case.

1614
02:18:55,202 --> 02:18:58,114
- Would you care to sit down?
- Not really.

1615
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:02,698
I want to try and...

1616
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:10,714
This is just... This is very awkward.

1617
02:19:13,262 --> 02:19:17,505
I'm afraid my firm has behaved

1618
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:19,965
in an unethical manner.

1619
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:24,812
It seems that we, Bendini, Lambert & Locke,

1620
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:27,431
the entire firm, has been engaged in a...

1621
02:19:28,902 --> 02:19:31,109
Well, a conspiracy.

1622
02:19:33,115 --> 02:19:36,357
We've been

1623
02:19:36,451 --> 02:19:38,908
overbilling our clients.

1624
02:19:54,845 --> 02:19:57,461
In some cases, massive overbilling.

1625
02:19:58,974 --> 02:20:03,809
I assure you I had no idea any of this
was going on when I joined the Firm.

1626
02:20:03,937 --> 02:20:07,270
Well, I feel I have to report this criminal behavior.

1627
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:10,481
But I can't use...

1628
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:15,605
I can't use your invoices without
your written authorization.

1629
02:20:15,699 --> 02:20:17,985
- Our invoices?
- Tony, please.

1630
02:20:18,952 --> 02:20:20,192
Listen.

1631
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:21,444
Yes, sir. Your bills.

1632
02:20:21,538 --> 02:20:25,747
You see, it's an important part of
the proof that we've overbilled you.

1633
02:20:27,336 --> 02:20:28,701
That's it?

1634
02:20:30,505 --> 02:20:32,712
Pretty much.

1635
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:36,880
Well, most of our clients have
already agreed, pretty much all.

1636
02:20:37,012 --> 02:20:39,754
Except for you. Which is why I'm here.

1637
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:45,009
And this is what you've been talking to the FBI about?

1638
02:20:46,605 --> 02:20:48,846
You want us to let you turn our bills...

1639
02:20:48,941 --> 02:20:52,900
What we charged you, I should say overcharged you.

1640
02:20:53,028 --> 02:20:55,861
- over to the government.
- Yes, sir.

1641
02:20:55,948 --> 02:20:57,984
- Now, does that in any way...
- No, sir.

1642
02:20:58,075 --> 02:21:02,694
It does not in any way waive your rights
to full and complete confidentiality

1643
02:21:02,788 --> 02:21:06,372
in any other area of the attorney-client relationship.

1644
02:21:08,877 --> 02:21:10,742
I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.

1645
02:21:12,214 --> 02:21:15,172
Whether I like it or not, I can't
talk to the government about you

1646
02:21:15,258 --> 02:21:17,874
even when I'm no longer your lawyer.

1647
02:21:19,554 --> 02:21:22,421
That would be breaking my word, my oath.

1648
02:21:23,058 --> 02:21:24,719
All right, Mitch.

1649
02:21:25,769 --> 02:21:28,260
So what was this stealing of the files?

1650
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,888
What the fuck was this all about?

1651
02:21:30,983 --> 02:21:33,269
The files haven't been stolen.

1652
02:21:33,402 --> 02:21:36,394
They're in exactly the same place they were.

1653
02:21:37,239 --> 02:21:40,151
I just felt it was important
for me to be thoroughly familiar

1654
02:21:40,242 --> 02:21:42,733
with the precise make-up and whereabouts

1655
02:21:42,828 --> 02:21:45,570
of all your holdings and activities.

1656
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:50,290
So I prepared copies of everything.

1657
02:21:53,505 --> 02:21:55,791
That way you and I can communicate perfectly,

1658
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:59,667
and, of course, if we ever
have to talk to a third party,

1659
02:22:01,263 --> 02:22:02,969
then I know everything,

1660
02:22:03,098 --> 02:22:07,432
right down to the penny,
pound, franc and deutsche mark.

1661
02:22:08,854 --> 02:22:11,561
I know everything you know.

1662
02:22:11,648 --> 02:22:14,264
As I should, as your attorney.

1663
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:20,191
And what if the Firm should desire at some point

1664
02:22:20,282 --> 02:22:22,273
to terminate your employment?

1665
02:22:22,367 --> 02:22:28,784
Whatever I know, wherever I go, I am
bound by the attorney-client privilege.

1666
02:22:29,916 --> 02:22:32,123
I am very much like...

1667
02:22:33,795 --> 02:22:36,207
I would say I am exactly like

1668
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:41,209
a ship carrying a cargo that will never reach any port.

1669
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:48,845
And as long as I am alive, that ship
will always be at sea, so to speak.

1670
02:22:49,895 --> 02:22:52,682
Like Yasir-fucking-Arafat, huh?

1671
02:22:53,231 --> 02:22:55,643
Never a night in the same place.

1672
02:22:57,319 --> 02:23:00,231
In any case, I need your written authorization,

1673
02:23:00,322 --> 02:23:04,406
so I can release your bills,
like every other client has given.

1674
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:12,910
You have this authorization with you?

1675
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:14,286
I do.

1676
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:39,641
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1677
02:23:43,073 --> 02:23:44,108
Fuck!

1678
02:23:44,908 --> 02:23:48,742
You got the account number? You know how to access it?

1679
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,194
Mitch has verified that the money's there.

1680
02:23:50,288 --> 02:23:52,074
$ 750,000.

1681
02:23:52,165 --> 02:23:54,747
I love your crooked little mouth.

1682
02:24:03,426 --> 02:24:05,417
Well, it's not my best feature.

1683
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:07,135
Wow!

1684
02:24:08,807 --> 02:24:09,922
Well, what is?

1685
02:24:33,248 --> 02:24:35,284
Where the hell are you?

1686
02:24:42,507 --> 02:24:44,793
What is this supposed to be? Huh?

1687
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,087
- You let the Moroltos off the hook?
- They're my clients.

1688
02:24:47,179 --> 02:24:49,261
They're the crooks. You're letting the Mafia get away.

1689
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:51,303
- What the hell are you doing?
- You guys are always one villain

1690
02:24:51,433 --> 02:24:52,422
behind the times, you know that?

1691
02:24:52,517 --> 02:24:54,633
You gave me a bunch of pencil
pushers who padded their bills.

1692
02:24:54,769 --> 02:24:57,010
You think if they don't pull
guns, they aren't the bad guys.

1693
02:24:57,105 --> 02:24:59,141
Ask the Moroltos who's harder to find,

1694
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:01,230
the killer or the lawyer who hides their money.

1695
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,353
Don't give me that shit!

1696
02:25:02,444 --> 02:25:03,559
That's a bunch of double talk and you know it.

1697
02:25:03,653 --> 02:25:05,894
You want the Mafia? Get their lawyers.

1698
02:25:05,989 --> 02:25:08,196
Without the Firm, the only way
the Moroltos can launder money

1699
02:25:08,283 --> 02:25:09,398
is in a washing machine.

1700
02:25:09,492 --> 02:25:11,232
You are so naive.

1701
02:25:11,328 --> 02:25:13,159
There'll be a thousand other Bendini-Lamberts

1702
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:14,994
fighting for the chance to launder money tomorrow.

1703
02:25:15,123 --> 02:25:16,829
How the hell you gonna get all of them?

1704
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:18,448
One at a time.

1705
02:25:19,377 --> 02:25:20,742
I'm a lawyer and I got mine.

1706
02:25:20,837 --> 02:25:23,044
You're the cop, Tarrance, you get the rest of them.

1707
02:25:23,131 --> 02:25:24,462
Get them with what?

1708
02:25:24,549 --> 02:25:27,131
Overbilling? Mail fraud? That's exciting.

1709
02:25:27,219 --> 02:25:32,259
It's not sexy, but it's got teeth,
$ 10,000 and five years in prison.

1710
02:25:32,349 --> 02:25:34,886
That's 10 and five for each act.

1711
02:25:36,144 --> 02:25:38,305
Have you really looked at that?

1712
02:25:38,396 --> 02:25:41,263
You've got every partner in the Firm on overbilling.

1713
02:25:41,358 --> 02:25:43,895
There's 250 acts of documented mail fraud there.

1714
02:25:43,985 --> 02:25:45,191
That's racketeering.

1715
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,312
That's a minimum of 1,250 years in prison

1716
02:25:48,406 --> 02:25:50,772
and two and a half million dollars in fines.

1717
02:25:50,867 --> 02:25:52,858
That's more than you had on Capone.

1718
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:56,361
You twist this into whatever you
want. You made a deal to save your ass.

1719
02:25:56,498 --> 02:25:58,830
You got our money, three quarters
of a million dollars of it,

1720
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:01,249
you're still a hot-shot lawyer and you're out of this.

1721
02:26:01,336 --> 02:26:02,542
I didn't keep a nick el of your money.

1722
02:26:02,671 --> 02:26:04,536
It was always for somebody else.

1723
02:26:04,673 --> 02:26:05,708
And, yeah,

1724
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,297
I'm still a lawyer with references
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke.

1725
02:26:08,385 --> 02:26:11,218
You want to put that on your resume?

1726
02:26:11,346 --> 02:26:13,462
You think I'm ever gonna turn
on the ignition in my car again

1727
02:26:13,556 --> 02:26:14,671
without sweating?

1728
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:18,224
Then I don't understand you. What did you do it for?

1729
02:26:19,562 --> 02:26:20,927
You didn't win a thing.

1730
02:26:21,022 --> 02:26:25,265
Oh, yeah, I did. I won my life back.
You don't run me and they don't run me.

1731
02:26:26,361 --> 02:26:28,147
You want to know something weird?

1732
02:26:28,238 --> 02:26:31,822
I discovered the law again. You
actually made me think about it.

1733
02:26:31,908 --> 02:26:36,368
I managed to get through three years
of law school without doing that.

1734
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:42,874
It's you at the dog track. I
could have gone public with it.

1735
02:26:42,961 --> 02:26:45,748
- Why didn't you?
- It's against the law.

1736
02:26:51,553 --> 02:26:52,963
Okay.

1737
02:26:55,890 --> 02:26:59,758
How in the hell did you ever come up with mail fraud?

1738
02:27:01,062 --> 02:27:03,053
It was on the bar exam.

1739
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:07,057
They made me study like hell for it.

1740
02:27:43,563 --> 02:27:47,647
Well, you've had a busy day.

1741
02:27:50,487 --> 02:27:52,148
So did you.

1742
02:27:54,657 --> 02:27:57,615
Why didn't you tell me the truth about your plan?

1743
02:27:57,744 --> 02:27:59,780
All of it? The Moroltos.

1744
02:28:00,413 --> 02:28:04,122
Because I knew you'd worry,
and that might make you stay.

1745
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:07,917
And I knew you needed to leave.

1746
02:28:18,014 --> 02:28:20,756
I like what you've done to the place.

1747
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:24,976
- I thought you were going to your folks'.
- I was.

1748
02:28:27,357 --> 02:28:29,018
Some detour.

1749
02:28:32,612 --> 02:28:34,148
Where are you going?

1750
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:35,986
To look for you.

1751
02:28:40,662 --> 02:28:44,951
I guess I didn't feel I could leave
you without trying to help you.

1752
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:51,290
Do you want to tell me what happened?

1753
02:28:54,509 --> 02:28:56,170
Someday.

1754
02:28:58,179 --> 02:29:02,513
I think you should know that Avery was pretty decent.

1755
02:29:05,353 --> 02:29:09,437
He was decent, and corrupt,

1756
02:29:09,524 --> 02:29:11,890
and ruined, and so unhappy...

1757
02:29:12,026 --> 02:29:13,061
Listen, Abby...

1758
02:29:13,194 --> 02:29:15,105
And it could have happened to you, all of it.

1759
02:29:15,196 --> 02:29:16,686
You were on your way.

1760
02:29:16,823 --> 02:29:18,404
Did I lose you?

1761
02:29:25,373 --> 02:29:26,533
You look tired.

1762
02:29:26,666 --> 02:29:27,872
Did I?

1763
02:29:39,846 --> 02:29:42,053
I've loved you all my life.

1764
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:46,136
Even before we met.

1765
02:29:48,897 --> 02:29:52,685
Part of it wasn't even you,
it was just a promise of you.

1766
02:29:54,027 --> 02:29:58,646
But these last days, you kept your promise.

1767
02:30:06,331 --> 02:30:08,242
How could you lose me?

1768
02:30:41,199 --> 02:30:44,191
- You think it will make it?
- Make it where?

1769
02:30:45,537 --> 02:30:47,198
Boston.

1770
02:30:47,288 --> 02:30:49,028
What's in Boston?

1771
02:30:49,707 --> 02:30:51,038
We are.

1772
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,037
And the Wong Boys, and my kids.

1773
02:30:58,883 --> 02:31:02,467
And a very small unknown law firm.

1774
02:31:02,554 --> 02:31:04,590
With a lot of potential.

1775
02:31:05,807 --> 02:31:07,047
Yeah.
