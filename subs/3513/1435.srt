1
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,960
I beg your pardon. I forgot to knock.

2
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm alone.

3
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,390
Aren't we all?

4
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,230
- You're late, 007. - I had to stop in the bathroom.

5
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,960
Ready to save the world again?

6
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,200
After you, 006.

7
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,140
James, for England.

8
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,650
For England, Alec.

9
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,890
It's too easy.

10
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,360
Half of everything is luck, James.

11
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,600
And the other half?

12
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,060
Fate.

13
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
- Set timers: six minutes. - Six minutes, check.

14
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,090
Fire!

15
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,830
Closing time, James! Last call!

16
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,700
Buy me a pint.

17
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,590
This is Colonel Ourumov! Come out with your hands above your heads!

18
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,090
How original.

19
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,170
Alec?

20
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,220
Move out Throw down your weapon and walk towards me, slowly.

21
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,450
Finish the job, James! Blow them all to hell!

22
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,120
You have ten seconds.

23
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,930
Ten...

24
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,200
nine... eight...

25
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,330
seven... six...

26
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,370
five...

27
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,970
four... three... two...

28
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,640
For England, James!

29
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,770
Hold your fire! You'll blow the gas tanks!

30
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,810
This is your last chance. Come out with your hands above your....

31
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,420
Wait!

32
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,590
You can't win.

33
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,730
Get out there! Move! Move it!

34
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,900
Hold your fire!

35
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,340
Wait!

36
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,510
James, is it really necessary to drive quite so fast?

37
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,340
More often than you'd think.

38
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,220
I enjoy a spirited ride as much as the next girl, but...

39
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,220
- Who's that? - The next girl.

40
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,160
James, stop this! Stop it! I know what you're doing.

41
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,290
Really? What's that, dear?

42
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,370
You are just trying to show off the size of your, your...

43
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,240
- Engine? - Ego.

44
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,955
We're having a pleasant drive and

45
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,570
you've got to bring psychology into it.

46
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,870
I was just sent here to evaluate you.

47
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,880
Let's try and put that behind us, shall we?

48
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,880
Ladies first

49
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,160
- James, I want you to stop this car. - Really?

50
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,070
Stop this car at once!

51
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,210
As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.

52
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,980
James, you're incorrigible.

53
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,990
What am I going to do with you?

54
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,630
Well, let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

55
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,270
A very thorough evaluation.

56
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,260
Madame wins.

57
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,270
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

58
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,530
No players?

59
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,900
I come

60
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,890
It appears we share the same passions. Three, anyway.

61
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,040
I count two.

62
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,700
Motoring and baccarat.

63
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,680
Seven. Madame wins.

64
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,410
I hope the third is where your real talent lies.

65
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,550
One rises to meet a challenge.

66
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,950
Madame stands with five.

67
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,030
Six. Madame loses.

68
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,740
Enjoy it while it lasts.

69
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,930
The very words I live by.

70
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,310
And what words do you live by?

71
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,220
The trick is to quit while you're still ahead.

72
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,040
That's one trick I've never learned.

73
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,760
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

74
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,060
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

75
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,720
And for you?

76
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,420
The same.

77
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,430
How do you take it?

78
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,840
Straight up, with a twist.

79
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,500
Thank you, Mr....?

80
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,670
The name's Bond. James Bond.

81
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,110
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

82
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,350
- Onatopp? - Onatopp.

83
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,890
Your accent, Georgian?

84
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,050
Very good, Mr. Bond.

85
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,130
- You've been to Russia? - Not recently.

86
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,920
I used to drop in occasionally. Shoot in and out

87
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,730
It's very different now, a land of opportunity.

88
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,700
with a new Ferrari in every garage?

89
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,900
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

90
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,640
A tip for your friend:

91
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,100
The French registration plates for this year's model

92
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,540
start with the letter "L."

93
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,550
Even the counterfeit ones.

94
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh. And what rank do you hold...

95
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,220
with the Motor Vehicles Department, Mr. Bond?

96
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,950
Commander.

97
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,550
- Shall we go? - This one is an Admiral.

98
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,460
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

99
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,130
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

100
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,300
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

101
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,960
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

102
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,500
Identification confirmed:

103
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,560
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

104
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,700
Current suspected links to the Janus crime syndicate, St. petersburg.

105
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,070
Yacht Manticore is leased to a known Janus corporate front.

106
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,150
M authorizes you to observe Miss Onatopp...

107
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,880
but stipulates no contact without prior approval.

108
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,180
End transmission. Moneypenny. Good night, James.

109
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,920
I trust you'll stay "on-a-topp" of things.

110
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,230
Xenia, I can't breathe!

111
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,640
Yes! Yes!

112
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,920
My respects, Admiral.

113
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,650
Delighted to have you aboard, Mademoiselle.

114
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,620
Ladies and gentlemen...

115
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,720
please take your seats on the upper deck for the demonstration of the aircraft.

116
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,300
What you are about to see in operation...

117
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,060
is Europe's answer to the electronic battlefield:

118
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,700
the first working prototype of the Tiger helicopter.

119
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,540
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger not only uses stealth technology...

120
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,670
it is the only helicopter to be hardened against...

121
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,810
all forms of electronic interference...

122
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,510
radio jamming and electromagnetic radiation.

123
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,590
I have a small surprise from your friends back at the barracks

124
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,000
I think I've gone to heaven.

125
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,730
Not yet.

126
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,280
Now please welcome the pilots.

127
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,910
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert...

128
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,920
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.

129
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,090
Select Mir.

130
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,890
Autographic projection.

131
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,560
Compute possible intercept with second stage geo-sat two.

132
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,460
Anna.

133
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,080
He wouldn't know a woman if one came up and sat on his head.

134
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,980
Boris.

135
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,410
- Boris! - What?

136
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,020
I thought I'd post it on the Internet, no?

137
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,690
- What's the password? - I made it easy this time.

138
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,930
Even you should be able to break it, borscht for brains.

139
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,600
All right, all right, I'll give you a hint.

140
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,110
They're right in front of you and can open very large doors.

141
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,840
You're such a geek.

142
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,450
Yes, I'm in!

143
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,590
You've hacked into the U.S. Department of Justice.

144
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,660
Do you know what will happen if they trace it here?

145
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,360
The Chief of Computers will call me a genius...

146
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,770
move me to Moscow and give me a million bucks hard currency.

147
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,300
I think not.

148
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,000
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads. They'll never detect me.

149
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,880
You were saying, slug-head?

150
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,850
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

151
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,590
Spiked them!

152
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,750
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

153
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,550
No way! I spiked them!

154
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,290
All right, what's the password?

155
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,420
I'm not going to tell you.

156
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,370
Okay, let me guess.

157
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,060
It's not in front of me?

158
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,870
You sit on it, but you can't take it with you.

159
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,010
My program seizes the phone line of whoever's tracing me...

160
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,350
and jams their modem so they can't hang up.

161
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,210
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

162
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,920
Better luck next time...

163
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,760
slug-heads!

164
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,970
Bang! Gone!

165
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,230
I am invincible!

166
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,370
Was it good for you, too?

167
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,110
I'm getting some coffee.

168
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,120
I'm going for a cigarette.

169
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,580
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

170
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,210
head of Space Division.

171
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,660
- General, if I'd known... - You'd have been ready.

172
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,955
This is an unscheduled test of the Severnaya facility.

173
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,140
War simulation.

174
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye. Report your status.

175
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,170
Two operational satellites, sir: Petya and Mischa...

176
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,270
both in 90-minute earth orbit at 100 kilometers.

177
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,320
Good. Here is the authorization code.

178
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,380
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access numbers for satellite Petya, please.

179
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,520
I am timing you.

180
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,180
Good. Thank you, Major.

181
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,620
On my count.

182
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,930
Three... two... one.

183
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,640
Set target: Severnaya.

184
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,250
Arm the weapon.

185
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,540
Check it!

186
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,820
Their best response time is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

187
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,800
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

188
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,640
- Good evening, Moneypenny. - Good evening, James.

189
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,980
M will meet you in the situation room. I'm to take you straight in.

190
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,450
I've never seen you after hours, Moneypenny. Lovely.

191
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,820
- Thank you, James. - Out on a professional assignment?

192
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,350
Dressing to kill?

193
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,050
I know you'll find this crushing, 007...

194
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,750
but I don't sit at home every night praying for an international incident...

195
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,490
so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond.

196
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,800
I was on a date with a gentleman. We went to the theater together.

197
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,430
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

198
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,970
What would I ever do without you?

199
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,600
As far as I can remember, James, you've never had me.

200
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,810
Hope springs eternal.

201
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,440
You know, this sort of behavior could qualify as sexual harassment.

202
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,050
Really? What's the penalty for that?

203
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,090
Someday you have to make good on your innuendos.

204
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,790
- After you, Moneypenny. - No, I insist.

205
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,460
You first

206
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,800
- Good evening, 007. - Tanner. What's up?

207
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,470
Sixteen minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call...

208
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,010
from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya.

209
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
Look what the satellite picked up.

210
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,780
We found a match: your missing Tiger.

211
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,220
In the middle of Northern Russia.

212
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,230
It seems your hunch was right, 007.

213
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,230
It's too bad the evil Queen of Numbers wouldn't let you play it.

214
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,830
- You were saying? - No, I was just...

215
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,990
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,

216
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,040
Mr. Tanner, I'll talk to my children.

217
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,840
- Good evening, 007. - Good evening, M.

218
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,280
The Prime Minister's waiting for an update.

219
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,380
Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.

220
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,890
Thank you.

221
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,720
After the distress signal, your helicopter took off...

222
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,390
and the Russians scrambled these three MIGs here to intercept it.

223
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,020
What do you think the Russians are using the base for?

224
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,930
Well, at one point we suspected Severnaya might be the ground station...

225
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,870
for a secret space-based weapons program called GoldenEye,

226
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,870
Our statistical analysis saw they had...

227
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,210
neither the finance nor technology to implement it.

228
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,610
Numbers were never my strong suit.

229
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,610
Are these pictures live?

230
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,200
Unlike the American government,

231
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:57,510
we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

232
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,570
Negative so far. Everything seems normal.

233
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,510
What the bloody hell was that?

234
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,720
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

235
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,100
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

236
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,350
Boris!

237
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,610
Boris!

238
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,380
Thanks

239
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,380
Our satellite is knocked out

240
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,080
So are two of the Americans.

241
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,320
We have another coming into range...

242
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,830
now.

243
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,190
Good God.

244
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,040
Two of the MIGs are down.

245
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,830
And it looks like the third went into the dish.

246
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,870
What do you think?

247
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,740
No lights.

248
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,540
Not one single electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

249
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,380
E.M.P.?

250
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,640
- That explains the MIGs and satellites. - And the blackout

251
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,720
Electromagnetic Pulse:

252
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,480
a first-strike satellite weapon developed by the...

253
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,120
The Americans and Soviets during the Cold War.

254
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,030
I've read the brief. Discovered after Hiroshima.

255
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,760
Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

256
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,360
Creates a pulse...

257
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,600
a radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.

258
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,400
The idea being to knock out the enemy's communications...

259
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,200
before he, she, or they could retaliate.

260
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,880
So, GoldenEye exists.

261
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,010
Yes.

262
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,520
- Could this be an accident? - No.

263
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,380
The helicopter.

264
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,020
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,

265
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,550
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

266
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,275
Setting off the blast was the ideal way

267
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:36,890
to wipe out any trace of the crime.

268
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,190
The Janus group?

269
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,760
It may have been involved with the helicopter.

270
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,660
I know the Russian failsafe systems.

271
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,170
You don't just walk in and ask for the keys to the bomb.

272
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,500
You need the access codes.

273
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,540
It had to be an insider.

274
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,960
And at least one person probably knows who it is.

275
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,250
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

276
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,690
The Prime Minister's talked to Moscow.

277
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,120
They're saying it was an accident during a routine training exercise.

278
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,420
Governments change. The lies stay the same.

279
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,660
What else do we know about the Janus syndicate?

280
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Topflight arms dealers, headquartered in St. petersburg.

281
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,930
The first outfit to restock the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

282
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,370
The head man's unreliably described. No photographs.

283
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,570
The woman, Onatopp...

284
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,940
is our only confirmed contact.

285
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,570
- Would you care for a drink? - Thank you.

286
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,280
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the... - I prefer bourbon.

287
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,450
- Ice? - Yes.

288
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,745
have had access or authority at Severnaya.

289
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:26,330
have had access or authority at Severnaya.

290
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,530
The top name on the list is an old friend of yours, I understand.

291
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,730
Ourumov.

292
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,280
They made him a General.

293
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,850
He sees himself as the next Iron Man of Russia.

294
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,680
So our political analysts rule him out

295
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,410
He doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

296
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,510
Are these the same analysts who said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

297
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,290
Who said the helicopter posed no immediate threat...

298
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,790
and wasn't worth following?

299
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,230
You don't like me, Bond. You don't like my methods.

300
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,160
You think I'm an accountant...

301
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,760
a "bean counter," more interested in my numbers than your instincts.

302
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,270
- The thought had occurred to me. - Good.

303
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,110
Because I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur.

304
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,300
A relic of the Cold War...

305
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,180
whose boyish charms, though wasted on me, obviously appeal...

306
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,980
to that young woman I sent out to evaluate you.

307
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,250
- Point taken. - Not quite, 007.

308
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,700
If you think for one moment

309
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:23,090
I don't have the balls to send a man out to die...

310
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,660
your instincts are dead wrong.

311
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,660
I've no compunction about sending you to your death.

312
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,000
But I won't do it on a whim,

313
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:32,700
even with your cavalier attitude towards life.

314
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,930
I want you to find GoldenEye.

315
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,570
Find who took it, what they plan to do with it, and stop it.

316
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,980
And if you should come across Ourumov, guilty or not...

317
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,050
I don't want you running off on some kind of vendetta.

318
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,450
Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

319
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,890
- You didn't get him killed. - Neither did you.

320
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,080
Don't make it personal.

321
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,760
Never.

322
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,130
Bond.

323
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,930
Come back alive.

324
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,140
Good morning, General Ourumov.

325
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,710
Defense Minister Mishkin, gentlemen.

326
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,310
Please deliver your report.

327
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,330
As this Council is aware, 72 hours ago...

328
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,600
a secret weapon system code-named GoldenEye

329
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:07,920
was detonated over Severnaya.

330
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,360
As head of Space Division...

331
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:13,230
I personally undertook the investigation.

332
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,930
I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists...

333
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,570
seeking to create political unrest.

334
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,580
Regrettably, the peaceful work...

335
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,080
and much-needed hard currency earnings of Severnaya...

336
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,170
have been set back by several years.

337
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,190
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

338
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,950
It seems the Council does not want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

339
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,430
Merely your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.

340
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,520
I can give you that assurance, Defense Minister.

341
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,760
And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?

342
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:54,200
I was aware only of the one, Boris Grishenko.

343
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,280
There was a girl also whose body was not among the dead.

344
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,580
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

345
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,280
I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.

346
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,650
It would seem presumptuous, General...

347
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,820
to blame this incident on Siberian separatists...

348
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,290
before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.

349
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,620
Do you agree?

350
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,960
Yes, Defense Minister.

351
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,230
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

352
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,740
That will be all.

353
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:42,150
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

354
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,280
Hunting!

355
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,890
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

356
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
First, your new car, BMW.

357
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,840
Agile, five forward gears, all-points radar...

358
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,630
self-destruct system...

359
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,180
and naturally, all the usual refinements.

360
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,710
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

361
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,180
Behind the headlights, stinger missiles.

362
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,520
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day at the office.

363
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,890
Need I remind you, 007...

364
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,260
that you have a licence to kill...

365
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,390
not to break the traffic laws.

366
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,460
- I wouldn't think of it. - Good.

367
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,970
Right. Let's get on to more practical matters.

368
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,800
A typical leather belt.

369
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,670
Male, size 34, buckle notch.

370
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,740
- Have you finished? - Yes.

371
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,810
Good. A typical leather belt.

372
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,640
Q, I'm familiar with that device.

373
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:45,310
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord built into the buckle.

374
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,650
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

375
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,460
followed by a high-tensile wire designed to support your weight.

376
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,900
I see. And what if I need additional support?

377
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,470
It's tested for one, 007.

378
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,400
Flight 878 to St. petersburg.

379
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,070
X-ray document scanner.

380
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,170
A pen. This is a Class Four grenade.

381
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,880
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

382
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,510
Another three disarms it.

383
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,250
How long did you say the fuse was?

384
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,350
Oh, grow up, 007!

385
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,360
They always said the pen was mightier than the sword.

386
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,090
Thanks to me, they were right.

387
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Look, let's ask Freddie here to demonstrate for us.

388
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,600
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.

389
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,700
One... two... three.

390
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,880
Don't say it.

391
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,890
The writing's on the wall?

392
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,920
Along with the rest of him.

393
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,580
Now, 007, do please try and return some of...

394
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,890
this equipment in pristine order.

395
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,200
Don't touch that! It's my lunch.

396
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,170
In London, April's a spring month.

397
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,200
Oh, yeah? And what are you, the weatherman?

398
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,030
For crying out loud, another stiff-assed Brit...

399
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,940
with your secret codes and your passwords.

400
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,910
One of these days you guys are going to learn just to drop it.

401
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,240
Come on, my car's over there.

402
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,500
- After you. - Thank you.

403
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,760
Like you said, drop it.

404
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,840
In London, April's a spring month...

405
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,910
whereas in St. petersburg we're freezing our butts off!

406
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,970
Now, is that close enough for government work?

407
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,070
No. Show me the rose.

408
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,410
Please, no.

409
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,610
All right, all right, all right!

410
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,990
- Muffy? - Third wife.

411
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,530
- Jack Wade, CIA. - James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

412
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,660
- That's a nice move. - Nice car.

413
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,530
This baby hasn't let me down yet.

414
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,130
She's an ugly little bitch, but she gets you there.

415
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,730
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?

416
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,660
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

417
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,960
- What do you know about Janus? - Zilch. Zipsky.

418
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,700
No one's ever seen him. But the man's connected up the kazoo.

419
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,710
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

420
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,510
Rumor has it, he lives on one of those old Soviet missile trains...

421
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:34,670
that armored stuff they ran around the country so we couldn't target them.

422
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,840
Want to hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

423
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,980
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

424
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:45,250
Anyways, to tell the truth, you don't find this guy. He finds you.

425
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,330
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

426
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,890
The best thing I can do is point you in the direction of his competition.

427
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,070
- Who is the competition? - An ex-KGB guy.

428
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,910
A tough mother. Got a limp on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

429
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:05,740
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky? - Yeah. You know him?

430
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,150
I gave him the limp.

431
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,370
Yes?

432
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,440
Are these all you have?

433
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,410
How many do you want?

434
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,540
Twenty-four for the American school, eleven for the Swedish.

435
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,420
IBM compatible with 500 meg. hard drives...

436
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,920
CD ROM and 14.4 modems.

437
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,290
- Will you pay dollars? - Of course.

438
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,630
If madame would require a demonstration, I could...

439
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,360
Madame requires one demonstration model and a quiet place to test it.

440
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,610
Natalya.

441
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,500
Is everything satisfactory?

442
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,800
Everything except the interruption.

443
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,220
Now let me get you straight, Jimmy.

444
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,310
You shot him in the leg, you stole his car, you took his girl.

445
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,290
And now you want Valentin Zukovsky to set you up with Janus?

446
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,830
Yes.

447
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,160
Well, what are you going to do? Appeal to his heart?

448
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,090
No, his wallet.

449
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,600
Oh, that might work. Okay, show time.

450
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,170
Valentin operates out of building number 23 there.

451
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,040
Are you sure you want to do this?

452
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,240
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went home airfreight...

453
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,370
in very small boxes.

454
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,920
Make sure they send me home first-class.

455
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,870
Natalya, it's me! It's Boris!

456
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,380
It's Boris! It's Boris! Hello.

457
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,120
Another morning shot to hell.

458
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:38,260
Free market economy. I swear it will be the end of me.

459
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,090
Walther PPK, 7.65 millimeter.

460
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,860
Only three men I know use such a gun.

461
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,410
I believe I've killed two of them.

462
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,070
Lucky me.

463
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,270
I think not.

464
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,200
James Bond.

465
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,610
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

466
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,480
Shaken but not stirred.

467
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,450
I see you haven't lost your delicate sense of humor, Valentin, huh?

468
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,250
Or your need for an audience.

469
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,260
Who's strangling the cat?

470
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,860
Strangling a cat?

471
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,660
That is Irina, my mistress.

472
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,200
A very talented girl.

473
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,200
Irina! Take a hike!

474
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,640
So, Mr. Bond...

475
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,910
what is it that brings you to my neighborhood, hmm?

476
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,010
Still working for MI6...

477
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,750
or have you decided to join the 21st century?

478
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,690
I hear the new M is a lady.

479
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,260
I want you to do me a favor.

480
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,690
He wants me to do him a favor!

481
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,360
My knee aches...

482
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:32,530
every single day, twice as bad when it is cold.

483
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,910
Have you any idea how long the winter lasts in this country, hmm?

484
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,480
Tell him, Dimitri!

485
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,840
- Well, it depends... - Silence!

486
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,750
For an ex-KGB agent, you surprise me, Valentin.

487
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,910
Someone of your stature must've realized the skill was not to hit your knee...

488
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,720
but to... miss the rest of you.

489
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,290
So why did you not kill me?

490
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,800
Call it professional courtesy.

491
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,460
Then I should extend you the same courtesy.

492
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:06,140
Kirov's funeral parlor, 4:00 this afternoon.

493
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,550
Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives hidden in a casket.

494
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:15,080
Your man drives the hearse in, the money's exchanged...

495
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,580
their man drives the hearse out

496
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,420
Their man will be arrested with the explosives.

497
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,790
Your man will make a miraculous escape with the money.

498
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,290
Your money.

499
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,460
And what do I owe for this accommodation?

500
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:32,830
I want you to set me up... with Janus.

501
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,170
What has he done to deserve you?

502
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,800
- Stole a helicopter. - I have six.

503
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,880
Three. None that fly.

504
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,670
Who's counting?

505
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,040
These are not just criminals, Valentin, they're traitors.

506
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,780
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon.

507
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,820
Killed a lot of innocent Russians doing it.

508
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,480
- What do you expect from a Cossack? - Who?

509
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:58,150
This Janus, I've never met the man, but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

510
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,860
Group that worked for the Nazis against the Russians, Second World War.

511
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,460
You know your history, Mr. Bond. At the end of the war...

512
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,090
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered to the British in Austria...

513
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,350
believing they'd join your government

514
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,500
and wage war against the communists.

515
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,510
But, the British betrayed them...

516
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,270
sent them promptly back to Stalin who promptly had them all shot...

517
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,910
women, children, families.

518
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,850
Not exactly our finest hour.

519
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,460
Still, ruthless people. They got what they deserved.

520
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,210
I want you to set me up with Janus.

521
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,860
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

522
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,360
You're going to meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel Europe.

523
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,160
And then, you and I are even and he owes me one?

524
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,530
Precisely.

525
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,390
You don't need the gun, Commander.

526
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,720
That depends on your definition of "safe sex."

527
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,830
That's close enough.

528
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,200
Not for what I have in mind.

529
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,020
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

530
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,580
You think you can break me?

531
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,640
Yes! Yes!

532
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,800
Yes!

533
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,610
No, no, no.

534
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,280
No more foreplay.

535
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,690
Take me to Janus.

536
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,180
- This is it? - Yes.

537
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:39,350
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening. You?

538
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,940
Well, once again, the pleasure was all yours.

539
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,960
You'll understand if I don't call.

540
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,490
I won't lose sleep over it.

541
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,760
Sweet dreams.

542
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,790
Hello, James.

543
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,090
- Alec? - Back from the dead.

544
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,630
No longer just an anonymous star on the memorial wall at MI6.

545
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,630
What's the matter, James? No glib remark?

546
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,400
No pithy comeback?

547
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,870
Why?

548
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:48,480
Hilarious question, particularly from you.

549
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,150
Did you ever ask why?

550
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,265
Why we toppled all those dictators,

551
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:55,280
undermined all those regimes?

552
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,100
Only to come home:

553
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,950
"Well done, good job. But sorry, old boy.

554
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,860
Everything you risked your life and limb for has changed."

555
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,860
It was the job we were chosen for.

556
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,760
course you'd say that.

557
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:09,700
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier...

558
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,000
defender of the so-called "faith."

559
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:14,510
Oh, please, James, put it away.

560
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:17,740
It's insulting to think I haven't anticipated your every move.

561
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,440
Yes.

562
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,150
- I trusted you, Alec. - Trust?

563
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,090
What a quaint idea.

564
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,075
How did the MI6 screening miss that

565
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:35,030
your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

566
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,860
Once again, your faith is misplaced. They knew.

567
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,490
We're both orphans, James.

568
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,570
But where your parents had the luxury

569
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,540
of dying in a climbing accident...

570
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,900
mine survived the British betrayal

571
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,300
and Stalin's execution squads.

572
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,440
But my father couldn't let himself,

573
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,270
or my mother, live with the shame of it.

574
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,540
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

575
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,250
And in one of life's little ironies...

576
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,590
the son went to work for the government whose betrayal...

577
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,920
caused the father to kill himself and his wife.

578
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:11,050
Hence, Janus.

579
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:14,630
The two-faced Roman god come to life.

580
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:18,400
It wasn't God who gave me this face, it was you...

581
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,410
setting the timers for three minutes instead of six.

582
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,410
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

583
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,840
No. You're supposed to die for me.

584
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,550
Oh, by the way...

585
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:34,590
I did think of asking you to join my little scheme...

586
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,210
but somehow I knew...

587
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,280
007's loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend.

588
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,530
Closing time, James. Last call.

589
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,440
For England, James.

590
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,120
Mister!

591
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,580
Wake up, please!

592
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,750
- Wake up! - I'm here.

593
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,160
- I'm here! - Hurry!

594
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,700
Hurry up! Come out!

595
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,730
Pull yourself together! We're going to die!

596
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,300
Do something! Get us out of here!

597
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:29,710
I'm a little tied up. Never mind.

598
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,120
The things that we do for "frequent flyer" mileage.

599
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,490
Here, let me help you.

600
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,560
That's it, mind your head.

601
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:08,230
Let me go!

602
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:54,050
Who are you?

603
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,590
Listen, I'm on your side. I'm here to help you.

604
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,090
- I don't know anything. - I don't believe you.

605
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,090
- I don't care what you believe. - Look!

606
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,710
They might be back for us any minute.

607
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,220
You either take your chances with me...

608
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,560
or your fellow countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya.

609
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:10,500
I've never been to Severnaya.

610
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,840
Your watch has. Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.

611
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,520
And I'm willing to bet you're the one

612
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,100
who climbed up the dish to get out

613
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,810
- Who are you? - I work for the British government.

614
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,380
And the more you tell me, the more I can help you.

615
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,700
But I don't know anything!

616
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:28,920
Then let's start with what you do know.

617
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,390
My name is Natalya Simonova.

618
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,400
I was a systems programmer at Severnaya facility until

619
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,170
Go on.

620
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,040
- Until they killed everyone. - Who? Alec Trevelyan?

621
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,050
No. I don't know who that is.

622
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,780
Who was the insider? Who was the traitor?

623
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,180
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

624
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:04,250
- KGB or military? - Computer programmer.

625
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,550
- There was no one else? - No.

626
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,260
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

627
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,470
Trust me.

628
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,840
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

629
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,530
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

630
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,040
Sit.

631
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,410
I'm Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

632
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,790
So, by what means shall we execute you, Commander Bond?

633
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,950
What, no small talk?

634
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,620
No chitchat? That's the trouble with the world today.

635
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:48,000
No one takes the time to do a sinister interrogation anymore.

636
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,290
It's a lost art.

637
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,270
Your sense of humor doesn't slay me, Commander. I'm sorry.

638
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,570
- Where is the GoldenEye? - I assumed you had it.

639
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,880
I have an English spy,

640
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,090
a Severnaya programmer

641
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,300
and the helicopter they took.

642
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,280
That's what some traitor in your government wanted it to look like.

643
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,730
Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?

644
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,080
Who had the authorization codes?

645
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,780
Russia may have changed, but the penalty for terrorism is still death!

646
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,970
And what's the penalty for treason?

647
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,050
Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

648
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,060
You're like boys with toys.

649
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,060
It was Ourumov. General Ourumov set off the weapon.

650
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,400
I saw him do it.

651
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,230
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

652
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,500
Yes. He killed everyone and stole the GoldenEye.

653
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,410
And why would he do that?

654
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,150
There is another satellite.

655
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,220
Another GoldenEye?

656
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,160
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

657
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,365
You were saying something about

658
01:16:50,365 --> 01:16:52,030
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

659
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,160
Defense Minister, I must protest!

660
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:59,170
This is my investigation. You are out of order.

661
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,870
From what I am hearing, it is you who's out of order!

662
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,940
- I have seen this gun before. - Put it down.

663
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,780
- In the hand of our enemy. - Put it down, General!

664
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,870
Do you even know who the enemy is, Dimitri?

665
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,610
- Do you? - Guard!

666
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,890
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

667
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,030
murdered by a British agent, James Bond.

668
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,740
Himself shot while trying to escape. Guards!

669
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,120
Come on!

670
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,150
They're in the archives!

671
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,860
Down!

672
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,910
Spread out! Cover the other side!

673
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,580
Trust me.

674
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:10,700
Go now!

675
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:42,490
Faster!

676
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,070
Damn it!

677
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,620
Down the alley!

678
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:15,680
Use the bumper! That's what it's for!

679
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,810
What was that?

680
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,550
Go left!

681
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,390
Get out!

682
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:10,620
Either you've brought me the perfect gift, General Ourumov...

683
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,690
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

684
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:15,230
Mishkin got to them before I could.

685
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:19,250
Bond is alive?

686
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:20,760
He escaped.

687
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:24,100
Good for Bond. Bad for you.

688
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,700
Take a seat, my dear.

689
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,620
You know, James and I shared everything.

690
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,360
Absolutely everything.

691
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,840
To the victor go the spoils.

692
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,340
You'll like it where we're going.

693
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,490
You may even learn to like me.

694
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,830
Stay with her.

695
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:39,970
Bond.

696
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,310
Only Bond.

697
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,580
He's going to derail us.

698
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,680
Full speed!

699
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,710
Full speed! Ram him!

700
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:57,550
Why can't you just be a good boy and die?

701
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,780
You first

702
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:02,860
You... second.

703
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,260
Up!

704
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:11,630
Situation analysis: hopeless.

705
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:16,110
You have no backup, no escape route.

706
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:18,840
And I have the only bargaining chip.

707
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:20,570
Where is she?

708
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,710
Oh, yes. Your fatal weakness.

709
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,280
Ourumov, bring her in.

710
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,360
Lovely girl.

711
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:34,950
Tastes like... like strawberries.

712
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,990
- I wouldn't know. - I would.

713
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,540
So, back where we started, James.

714
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:51,400
Your friend or the mission.

715
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:54,100
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

716
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:02,050
Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?

717
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,820
You knew, didn't you? He's a Lienz Cossack.

718
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:10,090
- It's in the past. - He'll betray you!

719
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,460
- Just like everyone else. - Is this true?

720
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,935
you and I will have more money than God.

721
01:30:15,935 --> 01:30:18,300
you and I will have more money than God.

722
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,840
And Mr. Bond here will have a small memorial service...

723
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,470
with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

724
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:30,850
So, what's the choice, James?

725
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:35,080
Two targets. Time enough for one shot.

726
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:37,090
The girl, or the mission?

727
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:40,320
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

728
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,990
See you in hell, James.

729
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,310
One-inch armor plating.

730
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:00,740
I'm fine, thank you very much!

731
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,380
- Boris, yes! - What are you doing?

732
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,820
Boris is on-line, backing up his files.

733
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,760
If I can spike him, I might be able to find out where they're going.

734
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,790
But don't stand there! Get us out of here!

735
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,960
Yes, sir.

736
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,320
Good luck with the floor, James.

737
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,270
I set the timers for six minutes...

738
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:46,120
the same six minutes you gave me.

739
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:49,660
It was the least I could do for a friend.

740
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,100
- What does that mean? - We've got three minutes.

741
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,070
What else do you call your butt?

742
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,300
- What? - It's Boris' password.

743
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,370
He plays word games: "What I sit on, but I don't take it with me."

744
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:38,380
- Chair. - Like I said.

745
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:44,110
Thirty seconds.

746
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:47,550
He's not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid.

747
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,050
Twenty-five seconds.

748
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:51,280
New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco.

749
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:52,880
Twenty seconds!

750
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,150
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

751
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:02,360
- Come on! - Wait!

752
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,900
He's in Cuba, Havana. No.

753
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:07,160
Now!

754
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:30,520
Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?

755
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,720
Standard operating procedure.

756
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:36,730
"Boys with toys."

757
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:43,340
Maybe I should take care of the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

758
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,110
Our trip?

759
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,680
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

760
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:55,080
I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you're talking about disarming.

761
01:33:56,990 --> 01:34:00,150
So, tell me.

762
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,560
Are there any other standard operating procedures...

763
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:06,560
I should be aware of, Commander?

764
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,270
Thousands.

765
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:16,270
But I only pay them...

766
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,170
Iip service.

767
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,060
My whole life, I dreamed about coming to the Caribbean.

768
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:47,230
It's so beautiful.

769
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,830
Not another human being in sight.

770
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:05,420
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

771
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,920
Yo, Jimbo!

772
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:35,510
Brought a little gift from old what's-his-name, uh, T, Z...?

773
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:37,280
- Q. - Yeah.

774
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,950
- What are you doing here, Wade? - Banyan trees.

775
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,650
I am not here.

776
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,750
The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement, absolutely nothing to do...

777
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:48,230
with your insertion into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

778
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,530
Yes, I do, perfectly.

779
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,830
Borrowed the plane from a friend of mine in the DEA.

780
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:55,570
Now, the Coast Guard and the FAA are both in the loop.

781
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:58,470
You're cleared on our radar for 0600 hours.

782
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,880
Here's the latest Sat-Int from Langley.

783
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,920
- Stay below 600 feet. - 500 feet.

784
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:07,320
- Who's that? - Natalya Siminova.

785
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,820
Natalya Simonova.

786
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,080
Russian Minister of Transportation.

787
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:16,350
Did you check her out?

788
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,950
- Head to toe. - Right.

789
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:23,990
So, you're looking for a dish the size of a football field, huh?

790
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:24,800
Doesn't exist.

791
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:27,590
You can't light a cigar in Cuba without us seeing it.

792
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,040
I know it's there.

793
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:32,170
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

794
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:36,280
I've never been to New Zealand. How'd she know about that?

795
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,610
What if I need backup?

796
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,950
Get on the radio. I'll send in the Marines.

797
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,410
Anyway, hang a left at the end of the runway.

798
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,920
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right. - Yo, Wade.

799
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,360
Just one thing: Don't push any of the buttons on that car.

800
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,300
- I was going to go bombing around in it. - Exactly.

801
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,000
Yo, James, I got faith.

802
01:37:00,085 --> 01:37:02,770
But be careful. He knows you're coming.

803
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:10,260
He was your friend, Trevelyan?

804
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:15,310
And now he's your enemy and you will kill him.

805
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,410
It is that simple?

806
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,390
In a word, yes.

807
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,580
Unless he kills you first

808
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:27,850
- Natalya... - You think I'm impressed?

809
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,260
All of you with your guns, your killing, your death. For what?

810
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,850
So you can be a hero?

811
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,460
- All the heroes I know are dead. - Natalya, listen to me.

812
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:40,660
How can you act like this? How can you be so cold?

813
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,970
It's what keeps me alive.

814
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:47,540
No.

815
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:50,410
It's what keeps you alone.

816
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:30,690
James?

817
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,290
Yes?

818
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:44,430
On the train...

819
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,000
when you told him to kill me and I meant nothing to you...

820
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:51,010
did you mean it?

821
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,630
Yes.

822
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:59,270
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

823
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05,220
No.

824
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,690
Turn ten degrees south, bearing one-eight-four.

825
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,420
Yes, sir.

826
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:12,150
Nothing. There is nothing here.

827
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:15,550
Let's make another pass.

828
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:30,800
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

829
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:31,130
Natalya.

830
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:36,330
This time, Mr. Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.

831
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:57,320
Wait for your turn.

832
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:33,650
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

833
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,230
Is the satellite in range?

834
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,330
- Six minutes. - Prepare the dish.

835
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:53,310
No! It's too early. I am not ready.

836
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,940
Do it!

837
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:26,970
No wonder we couldn't see it.

838
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,480
Come on.

839
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,900
The world's greatest cash card.

840
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:01,400
It had better not be rejected.

841
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:08,880
- Mischa is on-line. - Sir.

842
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,410
Kill him!

843
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,580
The man just won't take a hint.

844
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,090
- Target coordinates? - The target is London.

845
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:39,540
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

846
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:42,610
- How do you stop it? - The transmitter above the antenna

847
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,440
Antenna in position.

848
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,490
On my count.

849
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:25,590
Three... two... one.

850
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,910
God save the Queen.

851
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:17,840
The mainframe computer.

852
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,170
Don't move.

853
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,860
James! What an unpleasant surprise.

854
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:51,030
- We aim to please. - Where's the girl?

855
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,460
Find her!

856
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:04,710
So, how is old Q?

857
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:06,980
Up to his usual tricks?

858
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,640
The watch.

859
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:16,090
A new model.

860
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:18,560
Still press here, do I?

861
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,500
Interesting setup, Alec.

862
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,910
You break into the Bank of England via computer...

863
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:43,710
and then transfer the money electronically...

864
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:46,550
just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye...

865
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:49,750
which erases any record of the transactions.

866
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:53,690
- Ingenious. - Thank you, James.

867
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,770
But it still boils down to petty theft.

868
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:00,430
In the end, you're just a bank robber.

869
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:03,270
Nothing more than a common thief.

870
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:15,650
You always did have a small mind, James.

871
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:17,780
It's not just erasing bank records.

872
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:20,620
It's everything on every computer in Greater London:

873
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:22,945
tax records, the stock market,

874
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:25,160
credit ratings, land registries...

875
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:28,030
criminal records.

876
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:30,730
In 16 minutes and 43 sec...

877
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,790
No, 42 seconds... the United Kingdom will reenter the Stone Age.

878
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:37,400
A worldwide financial meltdown.

879
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:42,500
And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world 50 years on.

880
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:46,140
Oh, please, James. Spare me the Freud.

881
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,520
I might as well ask you if all the vodka martinis ever silence the screams...

882
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:51,420
of all the men you've killed.

883
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:58,020
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women...

884
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:01,220
for all the dead ones you failed to protect.

885
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:06,800
England is about to learn the cost of betrayal...

886
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:09,770
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

887
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:15,110
- Welcome to the party, my dear. - Natalya!

888
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:53,320
Don't ever do that again!

889
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:55,510
This is not one of your games, Boris.

890
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:59,080
Real people will die! You pathetic little worm.

891
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:03,320
She was in the mainframe. Check the computer.

892
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:07,590
She's a moron. A second-level programmer.

893
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:11,500
She works on the guidance system.

894
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:15,160
She doesn't even have access to the firing codes.

895
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,070
Retrorockets firing!

896
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,850
What the hell's happening?

897
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:44,770
We will have reentry in... 12 minutes!

898
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,770
- It will burn up over the Atlantic. - Deal with it!

899
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:53,210
She changed the access codes!

900
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,150
Well, then she can fix it.

901
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:03,480
Go ahead, shoot him. He means nothing to me.

902
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,250
I can do it!

903
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,660
- I can break her codes. - Then get on with it!

904
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:39,380
Tell him, now!

905
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:44,690
Give me the codes, Natalya! Give them to me!

906
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:00,570
- Can Boris break your codes? - Possibly.

907
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:04,710
Possibly?

908
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,250
We have to destroy the transmitter.

909
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:12,190
By the way, I'm fine, thank you very much.

910
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,820
Do you know how to use one of these?

911
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:46,680
Yes.

912
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:48,990
Good. Stay out of sight.

913
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:06,270
- How long? - Two minutes. One minute.

914
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,540
- Guard! - I'm fixing it!

915
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:12,120
If he moves, kill him.

916
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:37,230
Yes! I am invincible!

917
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:52,030
You know, James... I was always better.

918
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:11,290
Alpha One to Gunship.

919
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:14,890
Alpha One to Gunship!

920
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:17,340
Speak to me!

921
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:54,550
For England, James?

922
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,490
No.

923
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,990
For me.

924
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:20,770
Yes! I am invincible!

925
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:48,040
James! James!

926
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:50,040
Are you all right?

927
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,400
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

928
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,510
Suppose someone is watching?

929
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:11,820
No. There's no one within 25 miles, believe me.

930
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:14,330
Yo, Jimbo!

931
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:28,200
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh, coming through in a clinch?

932
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:33,950
It's tobacco plants. I said I'd be here, huh?

933
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:36,020
Yo! Marines!

934
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:50,560
Maybe you two would like to finish debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

935
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,330
- You ready? - I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

936
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,670
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

937
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:01,970
Darling, what could possible go wrong, eh?
