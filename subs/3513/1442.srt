1
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,625
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.

2
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,265
Particularly on such short notice.

3
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,359
lf you can't trust a Swiss banker, what's the world come to?

4
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:01,804
And now that we're all comfortable...

5
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,803
...why don't you sit down?

6
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:06,905
It was not easy...

7
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:09,206
...but I have retrieved the money.

8
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:13,307
No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again.

9
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,683
At the current rate of exchange, minus the fees and certain...

10
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,687
...unforeseeable expenses.

11
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,793
Voila, the receipt.

12
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,155
Would you like to check my figures?

13
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,595
I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

14
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,758
It's all there.

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,528
I didn't come for the money.

16
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,834
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen...

17
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,101
...from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.

18
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,147
I want to know who killed him.

19
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,113
-Terrible tragedy. -I just want a name.

20
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:49,879
I am merely the middleman. I'm trying to do the honorable thing...

21
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,556
...returning the money to its rightful owner.

22
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,194
We know how difficult that can be for a Swiss banker.

23
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,866
I am offering you the opportunity to walk out with the money.

24
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,796
And I'm giving you the opportunity to walk out with your life.

25
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,566
Looking at our present situation...

26
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,437
...as a banker, I'd have to say...

27
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,205
...that the numbers are not on your side.

28
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,580
Perhaps you failed to take into account...

29
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:20,752
...my hidden assets.

30
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,129
You've had a small reversal of fortune.

31
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,160
-Give me the name. -I can't tell you.

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,031
Let's count to three.

33
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,568
You can do that, can't you?

34
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:42,830
One.

35
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:45,432
Two.

36
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:46,936
All right.

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,075
But you'll have to protect me--

38
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,193
James.

39
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,769
Have you brought me a souvenir from your trip?

40
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,030
Chocolates?

41
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,832
An engagement ring?

42
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,674
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

43
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,068
How romantic.

44
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,610
I know exactly where to put that.

45
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,647
Oh, Moneypenny.

46
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,916
The story of our relationship:

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,253
Close, but no cigar.

48
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:21,023
I hate to tear you away from affairs of state. Would you mind coming in?

49
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,627
Right away, M.

50
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,337
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

51
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:33,342
The man who retrieved my money. Thank you. Excellent work.

52
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,941
Be careful, M. I might steal him from you.

53
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,543
Construction's not exactly my specialty.

54
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,514
Quite the opposite, in fact.

55
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:43,818
Best to the family.

56
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,195
Old friend?

57
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,065
We read law at Oxford together.

58
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,160
I always knew he'd conquer the world.

59
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,193
Care for a drink?

60
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,371
Yes, thank you.

61
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,831
He's a man of great integrity.

62
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,505
Who buys stolen reports for 3 million pounds.

63
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,137
Thank you.

64
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,509
Any leads on the sniper?

65
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,040
Not one.

66
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,510
Professional job.

67
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,977
She must be working for someone.

68
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,616
-Is this the stolen report? -Yes. Classified.

69
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,723
From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.

70
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,518
What would King want this for?

71
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,154
He was led to believe the document was a secret report...

72
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:30,563
...identifying the terrorists who'd attacked his new oil pipeline.

73
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:32,563
Interesting.

74
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,032
It doesn't explain why someone would want me out of their office alive.

75
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,783
King! The money.

76
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,411
Moneypenny, stop King.

77
00:06:58,631 --> 00:06:59,757
Move! Move, move!

78
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,665
Get out of the way!

79
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,135
Stop!

80
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,068
Move!

81
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,972
Get out of the way! Move!

82
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,254
Stop, stop!

83
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:59,321
It isn't finished!

84
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:06,323
Let go!

85
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,500
-What do you think you're--? -Let go!

86
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:38,756
Listen to me!

87
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,524
You can't get away.

88
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,126
We can make a deal. Tell me who's behind this...

89
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:44,324
...who you work for.

90
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:45,825
Don't do it!

91
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,403
Don't blow us up!

92
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:48,503
I can protect you.

93
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,865
Do you understand? I can protect you.

94
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,742
Not from him!

95
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:21,812
Hello, my dear.

96
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,395
Who is that young woman?

97
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,368
King's daughter.

98
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:39,934
Elektra.

99
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,031
Thank you.

100
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,503
The money was dipped in urea.

101
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:50,307
A highly compacted fertilizer bomb.

102
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,847
Having handled the money, the water on 007's hands...

103
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,747
...when he touched the ice, started a chemical reaction.

104
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:00,015
In one note, the anti-counterfeiting strip was replaced with magnesium...

105
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:03,455
...which acted as a detonator. And King's lapel pin...

106
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,152
...was switched for a copy...

107
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:09,095
...which contained a radio transmitter to trigger the blast.

108
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,498
In other words, he set off the bomb that killed him.

109
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,636
We know it was someone close to King...

110
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,004
...and our only lead committed suicide on that balloon.

111
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,672
But given the size of King's organization...

112
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,212
...it could be anyone, anywhere.

113
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,952
This will not stand.

114
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:35,222
We won't be terrorized by cowards who'd murder an innocent man...

115
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,860
...and use us as the tool.

116
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,120
We'll find those who committed this atrocity.

117
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,892
We'll follow them to the farthest ends of the earth, if needs be.

118
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,135
And we will bring them to justice.

119
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:00,315
Tanner!

120
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:04,716
M says you're off the active-duty list until you're cleared by medical.

121
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,989
Dislocated collarbone.

122
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:16,190
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid you'll be out of action for weeks.

123
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,530
Molly...

124
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,500
...I need a clean bill of health.

125
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,033
You have to clear me for duty.

126
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,078
-That wouldn't really be-- -Ethical?

127
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,343
Practical.

128
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:34,844
Smart.

129
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:37,482
Well, let's just...

130
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:39,857
...skirt the issue, shall we?

131
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,952
You'd have to promise to call me...

132
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,688
...this time.

133
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,256
Whatever the doctor orders.

134
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,266
I suppose if you stayed in constant contact--

135
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,598
Of course.

136
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:57,807
If you showed sufficient stamina...

137
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:02,072
-...cut out all kinds of-- -Strenuous activity?

138
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:27,234
I suppose we all have to pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

139
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,930
Oh, pipe down, 007.

140
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,000
Was it something I said?

141
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,610
No. Something you destroyed.

142
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,570
My fishing boat.

143
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,472
For my retirement...

144
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,275
...away from you.

145
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,386
Now, I want to introduce you to the young fellow...

146
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,491
...I'm grooming to follow me.

147
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:01,299
Helps to open the door.

148
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,136
And you might be...?

149
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,242
This is 007.

150
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:09,174
If you're Q, does that make him R?

151
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:13,012
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

152
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,318
Or at least half of it.

153
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,751
Now, I dare say, 007, that you've met...

154
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,855
...your match with this machine.

155
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,727
New model? Improved specs?

156
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,524
I thought you were on the inactive roster. Some injury?

157
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,398
We'll see about that.

158
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,831
As I was saying, the very latest in interception countermeasures.

159
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,668
Titanium armor, a multitasking heads-up display...

160
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,902
...and six beverage cup holders.

161
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,512
All in all, rather stocked.

162
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:46,406
''Fully loaded,'' I think is the term.

163
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:49,279
-I think-- -You're not here to think.

164
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,318
You're here to do what I tell you.

165
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:52,956
Now, go put on the coat...

166
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,486
...and demonstrate it for 007.

167
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,093
But of course.

168
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,287
Now watch closely, please, 007.

169
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,800
The right arm goes in the right sleeve, thus...

170
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:07,460
...and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

171
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:11,608
Note closely, please: pockets, poppers and zipper.

172
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,040
Take the lower part of the zipper...

173
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:15,645
...and insert it into--

174
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,109
Pull the tag.

175
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:19,914
You said--

176
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,920
He seems well-suited for the job.

177
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:32,089
You're not retiring anytime soon...

178
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,657
...are you?

179
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,767
Now, pay attention, 007.

180
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:40,199
I've always tried to teach you two things:

181
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:43,568
First, never let them see you bleed.

182
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,133
And the second?

183
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,402
Always have an escape plan.

184
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:05,120
Good evening. The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

185
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:08,097
The Cyprus authorities say she has escaped...

186
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,531
...after shooting dead two of her captors and is--

187
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:16,537
He shouted.

188
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,308
Shouted all the time.

189
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,265
Level one clearance required.

190
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,526
Level one clearance required.

191
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,003
Yes, 007?

192
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,044
Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King.

193
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:29,645
I wasn't aware you had an assignment on this case.

194
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,316
I brought the money in that killed King.

195
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:35,384
-Don't make this personal. -I'm not. Are you?

196
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,257
You're the only one who could seal her file.

197
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,757
Will you excuse us?

198
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,100
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

199
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:04,406
What happened?

200
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,383
After Elektra King was kidnapped...

201
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:14,018
...her father tried to deal with it on his own...

202
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,520
...with no success.

203
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:18,995
So he came to me.

204
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,939
As you are aware, we do not negotiate with terrorists.

205
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:37,874
And against every instinct in my heart...

206
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,908
...every emotion as a mother...

207
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,547
...I told him not to pay the ransom.

208
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,554
I thought we had time on our side.

209
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,424
You used the girl as bait.

210
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:59,168
The money in King's briefcase was the same amount...

211
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,368
...as the ransom demand for his daughter.

212
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,036
It's a message.

213
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,216
Your terrorist is back.

214
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,615
Victor Zokas.

215
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,020
A.k.a....

216
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,320
Renard.

217
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:25,688
The anarchist.

218
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:29,960
He was operating in Moscow in 1 996. Pyongyang, North Korea before that.

219
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:31,533
And he's been spotted...

220
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:35,729
...in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut and Cambodia.

221
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:39,307
All the romantic vacation spots.

222
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,536
His only goal is chaos.

223
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:45,011
After Robert came to me, I sent 009 to kill Renard.

224
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,546
Before he completed the mission...

225
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,877
...Elektra escaped.

226
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:52,182
A week later, our man caught up with him.

227
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,319
He put a bullet in his head.

228
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,420
That bullet's still there.

229
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,659
How did he survive?

230
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,755
The doctor who saved Renard couldn't get the bullet out...

231
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,797
...so Renard killed him.

232
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,003
It's moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his senses.

233
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,640
Touch, smell.

234
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,241
He feels no pain.

235
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:15,844
He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.

236
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,742
The bullet will kill him...

237
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:21,180
...but he'll grow stronger every day until the day he dies.

238
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:26,190
Robert is dead.

239
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,783
Ml6 is humiliated.

240
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,661
He's had his revenge.

241
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,657
Not quite.

242
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:37,567
Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.

243
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,533
And there's still one he hasn't touched.

244
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,003
Elektra.

245
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:51,774
I see the good doctor has cleared you.

246
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,349
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

247
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,814
I'm sure she was touched by his dedication...

248
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,488
...to the job in hand.

249
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:06,028
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

250
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:10,161
She's taken over the construction of her father's oil pipeline.

251
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,469
Find who switched that pin.

252
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:15,429
If your instincts are right, Renard will be back...

253
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:18,337
...and Elektra will be the next target.

254
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,175
The worm on the hook again.

255
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,176
She doesn't need to know the same man may be after her.

256
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:24,780
Don't frighten her.

257
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:26,745
A shadow operation?

258
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:27,975
Remember...

259
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,819
...shadows stay in front or behind.

260
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:32,812
Never on top.

261
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,883
You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.

262
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:39,987
I'm here to see Elektra King.

263
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:42,352
James Bond, Universal Exports.

264
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,926
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

265
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,393
We're having problems with the villagers.

266
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,958
I've told Miss King to stay at the office in Baku.

267
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:54,332
Oh, hell.

268
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:17,752
-Miss King, I told you to-- -I know what you told me.

269
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,069
Send the pipe around.

270
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,905
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

271
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:13,049
-Your father approved this route. -Then my father was wrong. Do it.

272
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,316
-Davidov-- -I'll talk to her.

273
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,719
I saw you at my father's funeral.

274
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,693
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,198
M told me she was sending someone. Mr...?

276
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,024
Bond.

277
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:31,366
James Bond.

278
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,000
Did you know my father?

279
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:37,834
I met him once, briefly.

280
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:41,472
You seem to have inherited his touch for diplomacy.

281
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,112
Saving the church?

282
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:45,305
And avoiding the bloodshed.

283
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,579
1 00 years ago, my mother's family discovered the oil here.

284
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,153
When the Soviet Union was formed...

285
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,584
...the Communists spent the next 70 years...

286
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,294
...plundering our countryside for it.

287
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:59,627
I saw their mess on the drive in.

288
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:03,227
The new pipeline will guarantee our future.

289
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:08,494
But it would be a crime to destroy what little is left of our past.

290
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:17,571
But you didn't come here to talk about oil, did you?

291
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,043
Tell me...

292
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,578
...have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

293
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,594
M sent me because your life might be in danger.

294
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:38,060
Please, I want to show you something.

295
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:42,531
I'm trying to build an 800-mile pipeline through Turkey...

296
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,768
...past the terrorists in Iraq...

297
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,342
...Iran and Syria.

298
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,139
Up here...

299
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,713
...the Russians have three competing pipelines...

300
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,248
...and they'll do anything to stop me.

301
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:57,952
My father was murdered, the villagers are rioting...

302
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,523
...and you have come all this way...

303
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,193
...to tell me that I ''might'' be in danger?

304
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,594
We suspect there is an insider.

305
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,229
My father's pin.

306
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:14,426
No, a duplicate.

307
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:18,164
With a transmitter inside that set off the bomb.

308
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:21,777
My family has relied on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.

309
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,379
I won't make that mistake a third time.

310
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:30,453
I'm going to finish building this pipeline...

311
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,384
...and I don't need your help.

312
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:35,792
If you'll excuse me, I have to check the survey lines.

313
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:38,427
I've always wanted to check the survey lines.

314
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,093
You don't take no for an answer.

315
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,098
I hope you know how to ski, then.

316
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,464
I came prepared for a cold reception.

317
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:09,656
Can't land.

318
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,157
Wind's too strong.

319
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:13,022
Hold her steady.

320
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,463
You ski very well, Mr. Bond.

321
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,794
Seems you enjoy being chased.

322
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:26,595
Happens all the time.

323
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,165
Less often than you might think.

324
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,870
So this is where they meet...

325
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:33,666
...the two ends of the pipeline.

326
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:35,542
Your father's legacy.

327
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,543
My family's legacy...

328
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,447
...to the world.

329
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,984
-Expecting visitors? -No.

330
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,695
This isn't a social call.

331
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,072
Head for the gully. I'll lead them into the trees.

332
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:06,174
Go, go!

333
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,264
See you back at the lodge.

334
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,374
-It's all right. -We're buried alive!

335
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:36,753
I can't stay here!

336
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,319
You're not going to.

337
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,792
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

338
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:48,055
Look at me. Elektra, look at me! Look at my eyes.

339
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,596
Look at my eyes.

340
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,097
Look at my eyes!

341
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,264
You're all right.

342
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,063
Everything's all right.

343
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:57,800
Trust me.

344
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,235
She's fine.

345
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,669
Some bumps and bruises, but otherwise fine.

346
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:33,365
She wants to see you. Not you, Davidov. Him.

347
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,823
Are you all right?

348
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:51,393
I need to ask you something.

349
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,793
And I want you to tell me the truth.

350
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,091
Who is it?

351
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,162
Who's trying to kill me?

352
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,000
I told you, I don't know.

353
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:03,237
But I'm gonna find him.

354
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,402
Not good enough.

355
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,903
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

356
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:13,382
I was afraid to go outside. I was afraid to be alone.

357
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,415
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

358
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,011
I was afraid to do anything at all.

359
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,052
Until I realized...

360
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:22,582
...I can't hide in the shadows.

361
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,851
I can't let fear run my life.

362
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:26,954
I won't.

363
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,863
After I find him...

364
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:32,534
...you won't have to.

365
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,665
Don't go.

366
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:38,306
Stay with me.

367
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:41,670
Please?

368
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,782
I can't do that.

369
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:51,377
I thought it was your job to protect me.

370
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,782
You'll be safe here.

371
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,188
I don't want to be safe.

372
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:05,992
I'll be back soon.

373
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:10,663
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

374
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,945
I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.

375
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,580
Impossible.

376
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,250
Vodka martini.

377
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,344
Shaken, not stirred.

378
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:35,448
Tell him James Bond is here.

379
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,020
Now.

380
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,860
I don't think you heard me.

381
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:58,108
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted to see you.

382
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:03,917
After you.

383
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:07,115
After you.

384
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:09,090
I insist.

385
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:13,954
And a little for you.

386
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,031
Bond! James Bond!

387
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,033
Meet Nina.

388
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:22,971
And Verushka.

389
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:26,172
Lose the girls, Valentin.

390
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,570
We need to talk.

391
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:32,447
Why am I suddenly worried that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

392
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:34,048
Chill out, James.

393
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:39,454
Fine, ladies.

394
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:40,953
Go on. Beat it. Scram.

395
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:43,092
Bull, give them an inch.

396
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:53,135
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

397
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,205
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

398
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:59,671
I see you put your money where your mouth is.

399
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:02,741
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.

400
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:05,107
So what would you like to talk about?

401
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:07,340
I'm not sure I can really help you.

402
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,576
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

403
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:15,087
Would you care for some caviar? My own brand: Zukovsky's Finest.

404
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:17,360
Look at this.

405
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,555
Russian Special Services.

406
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:26,268
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.

407
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,960
Where did you find this?

408
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,937
I took it off a Parahawk which tried to kill Elektra King this morning.

409
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,604
Renard is behind this.

410
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,477
I think you and I had better have a drink.

411
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:51,085
And then after Afghanistan, the KGB decided...

412
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:54,458
...Renard was a liability and just cut him loose.

413
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:56,428
Now he works freelance.

414
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,191
But for whom?

415
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:01,203
There are four competing pipelines.

416
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:04,670
I'm willing to bet half the customers in this casino would be...

417
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,639
...very happy to see the King pipeline disappear.

418
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,607
-What's funny? -Nothing. It appears...

419
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:14,613
...Miss King does not share your concern.

420
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:23,919
What are you doing here?

421
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:25,990
The same thing you are.

422
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:28,596
Looking for the people who tried to kill me.

423
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:30,926
Let me take you home. Now.

424
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:34,069
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

425
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:37,035
Miss King, how very nice to see you.

426
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,374
We've kept your father's chair free.

427
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:42,067
Free? Nothing comes free from you.

428
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:47,039
Your father had a credit line with us. One million U.S.

429
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,909
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

430
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:55,319
So what's it to be?

431
00:46:57,494 --> 00:46:59,553
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

432
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:01,989
Let's keep it simple.

433
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,330
One card.

434
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:05,728
High draw.

435
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:10,237
A million dollars.

436
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:15,543
Wait.

437
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:18,505
Bury the top three cards.

438
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:22,810
You're determined to protect me.

439
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,021
From yourself. You don't have to do this.

440
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:31,452
There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.

441
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:44,605
Queen of hearts.

442
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:59,446
It appears you've been beaten...

443
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,887
...by the ace of clubs.

444
00:48:07,063 --> 00:48:08,553
No hard feelings, my dear.

445
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:10,289
Come again soon.

446
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:17,468
Shall we?

447
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:23,845
This is a game I can't afford to play.

448
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,276
I know.

449
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,921
-What happened to Davidov? -I gave him the night off.

450
00:48:55,979 --> 00:48:57,947
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

451
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,116
For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims journeyed to this holy place...

452
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,616
...to witness the wonder of the natural flames that never die...

453
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:11,918
...and to test their devotion...

454
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:14,020
...to God...

455
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:18,524
...by holding the scalding rocks in their hands...

456
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,233
...as they said their prayers.

457
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,468
Tell me, Davidov...

458
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,106
...what happened this afternoon?

459
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:31,143
You promised me your best men.

460
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:33,407
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

461
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,107
Yes, but Bond--

462
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:36,842
Bond was unarmed.

463
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:42,549
And you, Arkov? Is everything ready for tomorrow?

464
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,352
I have the authorization and passes in the car.

465
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:48,087
I have arranged for a plane tonight, but....

466
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:49,690
But what?

467
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,733
We should scrub the rest of the mission.

468
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,962
The Parahawks were meant to be returned.

469
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:58,299
People will ask questions, even of me.

470
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,874
All because of his incompetence.

471
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:01,975
I see.

472
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:04,612
I see you're right. He should be punished.

473
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:07,914
Davidov, hold this for me.

474
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,752
It was wrong of me to expect so much of you.

475
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,820
Kill him.

476
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:22,258
He failed his test of devotion.

477
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:27,496
You can take his place.

478
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:29,327
Take his I.D.

479
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:32,868
And do be on time.

480
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:54,229
Poor shoulder.

481
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,964
It looks painful.

482
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:01,861
It needs constant attention.

483
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:06,967
I knew....

484
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:09,669
I knew when I first saw you.

485
00:51:10,747 --> 00:51:12,806
I knew it would be like this.

486
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,259
Enough ice for one day.

487
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:49,147
How did you survive?

488
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:58,523
I seduced the guards.

489
00:51:58,762 --> 00:51:59,694
Used my body.

490
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:02,692
It gave me control.

491
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:07,931
And the rest, I got a gun and started shooting.

492
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:12,907
And what about you?

493
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,974
What do you do to survive?

494
00:52:19,282 --> 00:52:20,749
I take pleasure...

495
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:24,409
...in great beauty.

496
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:05,614
Let's go. It's getting late.

497
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:12,848
What happened to Davidov?

498
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:14,886
I was told to expect him.

499
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,093
He was buried with work.

500
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:21,463
Let's go. Get your stuff.

501
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,674
Okay, come on.

502
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,436
Let's get out of here.

503
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:39,537
You're late.

504
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,316
Did you bring it?

505
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:42,785
The grease.

506
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,256
Of course.

507
00:55:54,964 --> 00:55:55,862
Excellent.

508
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:15,776
Get ready. We're 1 0 minutes out.

509
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,254
But make sure you wear the I.D.

510
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,330
I'm gonna go get some air.

511
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:28,023
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov. I'm a great admirer of your research.

512
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:31,393
It's not often we see someone of your stature here.

513
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:33,459
I go where the work takes me.

514
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,855
By the way, you have the transport documents?

515
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:48,576
I pulled the plutonium out of the one inside.

516
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:50,746
You can detonate the triggers now.

517
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:57,219
Look, our IDA physicist.

518
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,620
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

519
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:01,255
Take my word for it.

520
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,752
This year we decommissioned four test sites. Not even a glimmer.

521
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:12,033
Are you here for a reason?

522
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:14,635
Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

523
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:15,935
And you are...?

524
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,365
Mikhail Arkov. Russian Atomic Energy Department.

525
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:21,074
Miss...?

526
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:22,905
Doctor...

527
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:24,841
...Jones. Christmas Jones.

528
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:27,539
And don't make any jokes. I've heard them all.

529
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,251
I don't know any doctor jokes.

530
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:35,120
This is okay. Take the elevator down the hole.

531
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:37,292
Your friends are already down there.

532
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:39,590
Don't I get some protection?

533
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,957
No, Dr. Arkov.

534
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:45,032
Down there it's weapons-grade plutonium. Reasonably safe.

535
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:48,198
Up here we have leaking hydrogen bombs that your lab built...

536
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,066
...which I've spent the last six months cleaning up.

537
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:54,107
So if you need any protection at all, it's from me.

538
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:58,474
Your friends are waiting for you.

539
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:05,317
Doctor.

540
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:09,582
Aren't you forgetting?

541
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:14,591
Of course. Thank you.

542
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:16,524
By the way....

543
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,799
Expecting Davidov?

544
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:40,303
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

545
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:41,336
Get off.

546
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,074
Keep your mouth shut.

547
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:46,338
You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

548
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:49,544
Not dead enough for me.

549
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:51,675
Show a little gratitude.

550
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:54,350
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

551
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,348
That's right.

552
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:59,414
I couldn't kill you. You were working for me.

553
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,717
You delivered the money, killed King.

554
01:01:02,427 --> 01:01:03,917
Now you brought me the plane.

555
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,320
What's your plan for the bomb?

556
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,566
You first. Or could it be you don't have a plan?

557
01:01:10,903 --> 01:01:13,167
That bomb will never leave this room.

558
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:15,163
Neither will you.

559
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,648
How sad to be threatened by a man...

560
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,874
...who can't grasp what he's involved in.

561
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:29,411
Revenge is not hard to fathom for a man who believes in nothing.

562
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,145
And what do you believe in?

563
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:32,823
Preservation of capital?

564
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:34,754
Go ahead, shoot me.

565
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:36,525
I welcome it.

566
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:39,263
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

567
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:42,558
And the firefight will bring down half the army from above.

568
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:45,760
But when a certain phone call isn't made in 20 minutes...

569
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:47,264
...Elektra dies.

570
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:51,109
You're bluffing.

571
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:54,311
She's beautiful, isn't she?

572
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,580
You should have had her before...

573
01:01:57,149 --> 01:01:58,878
...when she was innocent.

574
01:01:59,284 --> 01:02:00,216
How does it feel...

575
01:02:01,153 --> 01:02:03,212
...to know I broke her in for you?

576
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,781
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

577
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:09,756
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

578
01:02:09,962 --> 01:02:12,294
A man tires of being executed.

579
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:15,595
But in your case, I feel nothing...

580
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:16,992
...just like you.

581
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:20,933
But then again, there's no point living if you can't feel alive.

582
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:28,439
-Drop the gun! -Keep away, colonel.

583
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,444
He's an impostor. Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

584
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,083
This is your impostor.

585
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:35,616
Along with the men outside on the plane.

586
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:36,845
They'll steal the bomb.

587
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:40,649
I said drop it!

588
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:52,628
On your knees!

589
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:56,570
Well done.

590
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:00,611
He would've killed us all.

591
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:02,640
Did you speak to him?

592
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:05,441
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

593
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:09,444
I suppose you were the one who allowed him down.

594
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,888
You had me...

595
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:23,090
...but I knew you couldn't...

596
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:25,429
...shoulder the responsibility.

597
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:34,107
Without any interruptions, let's proceed.

598
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,774
Too many new faces are here, including yours.

599
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,849
The bomb doesn't move until I am satisfied.

600
01:03:43,522 --> 01:03:45,683
All of you, to the surface, now.

601
01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:09,011
Come on! Go!

602
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,017
Move!

603
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:21,423
They're sealing us in.

604
01:04:23,962 --> 01:04:25,122
Who are you?

605
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,096
I work for the British government.

606
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:33,835
Stay calm.

607
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:40,127
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond...

608
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:41,663
...but we're even.

609
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:43,095
Soon...

610
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:45,593
...you'll feel nothing at all.

611
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:13,794
Seal the door! Close it!

612
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:27,545
Come on!

613
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,860
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

614
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:53,762
You're a British spy. Do you have a name?

615
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:55,132
The name's Bond.

616
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:01,876
James Bond.

617
01:08:12,224 --> 01:08:14,351
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

618
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:36,937
They won't get very far.

619
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:38,843
Every warhead has a locator card.

620
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,881
We can track the signal.

621
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,981
You mean one of these?

622
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,756
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

623
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:56,763
Anywhere in this circle: Russia...

624
01:08:56,968 --> 01:08:59,300
...Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan--

625
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,995
Sorry to interrupt. Elektra is calling from Baku.

626
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:03,435
It's on the video line.

627
01:09:03,675 --> 01:09:05,575
Put her on the wall screen.

628
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:13,076
I'm sorry. I would never call you except...

629
01:09:13,285 --> 01:09:14,582
...James has disappeared.

630
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:18,447
He left my villa in the middle of the night...

631
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:23,123
...and my head of security has been found...

632
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:26,092
...near a local airstrip, murdered.

633
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:28,657
I'll send someone out.

634
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:30,559
M, could you come?

635
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:33,634
I can't help thinking...

636
01:09:34,372 --> 01:09:35,703
...I'm next.

637
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:41,137
Get me out there.

638
01:09:41,379 --> 01:09:43,677
Just get me out there.

639
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,159
Gabor?

640
01:10:14,913 --> 01:10:16,073
Surprised?

641
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:18,742
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

642
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:19,974
Maybe.

643
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:21,777
Maybe I should ask you.

644
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:23,517
After all...

645
01:10:24,322 --> 01:10:26,790
...''There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.''

646
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:29,653
Isn't that right, Elektra? Isn't that your motto?

647
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:30,891
What do you mean?

648
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,929
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?

649
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:38,260
He and I had a chat. Knew all about us. Knew about my shoulder.

650
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,028
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

651
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,502
Renard's the man who's trying to kill me?

652
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:43,799
Drop the act.

653
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:46,432
It's over.

654
01:10:48,046 --> 01:10:49,240
I don't know what you mean.

655
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:51,014
Oh, I think you do.

656
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:55,344
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

657
01:10:56,554 --> 01:10:58,419
Common in kidnappings.

658
01:10:58,923 --> 01:11:01,050
Young, impressionable victim.

659
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:02,888
Sheltered.

660
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:06,820
Sexually inexperienced.

661
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:11,199
A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, manipulation.

662
01:11:12,704 --> 01:11:15,036
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

663
01:11:15,673 --> 01:11:17,538
The captive falls in love with her captor.

664
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:18,972
How dare you?

665
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:21,177
How dare you?

666
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:23,376
That animal. That monster?

667
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:25,746
He disgusts me.

668
01:11:26,751 --> 01:11:28,446
You disgust me.

669
01:11:29,354 --> 01:11:32,221
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

670
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:34,890
You had a sling on your arm at the funeral.

671
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:38,223
And I didn't have to sleep with you to find that out.

672
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,761
He used your exact words.

673
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,295
So you knew.

674
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,926
You knew all the time he was out there, coming for me...

675
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:46,103
...and you lied.

676
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,605
You used me.

677
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,140
You used me as bait.

678
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:56,375
And you made love to me.

679
01:11:58,283 --> 01:11:59,215
What?

680
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:03,485
To pass the time as you waited for him to strike?

681
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:19,268
He's struck again. Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

682
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:20,335
I'm coming with you.

683
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:24,603
You do what you want to do, but I've called M.

684
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,901
She's coming to take charge.

685
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:00,075
I want an update. Where do we stand?

686
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:04,106
One of Renard's men took the locator card from the bomb...

687
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:05,782
...so we can't track it. But....

688
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,212
But what?

689
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:09,251
With all due respect...

690
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,985
...I don't think you should be here.

691
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:16,457
May I remind you that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

692
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:19,228
You disobeyed an order and left that girl alone.

693
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,331
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent as you think.

694
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:25,196
-What are you saying? -Suppose the inside man...

695
01:13:25,403 --> 01:13:27,234
...the one who switched King's lapel pin...

696
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,036
...turned out to be an inside woman?

697
01:13:32,944 --> 01:13:35,879
She kills her father and attacks her own pipeline?

698
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,480
-Why? To what end? -I don't know...yet.

699
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:47,551
Look at that.

700
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:48,691
That's not right.

701
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:51,058
What is it?

702
01:13:51,262 --> 01:13:52,854
An observation rig.

703
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:55,123
Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.

704
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,664
Shut it down.

705
01:13:59,337 --> 01:14:00,235
I don't understand.

706
01:14:00,438 --> 01:14:02,030
It won't respond.

707
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,337
The place is clean. No sign of--

708
01:14:04,576 --> 01:14:07,044
-The bomb is in the pipeline. -Oh, my God!

709
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:10,076
They brought it through here. That'd explain the attack.

710
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:11,748
Heading for the oil terminal.

711
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,781
Where it would do the most damage.

712
01:14:13,985 --> 01:14:15,976
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

713
01:14:17,889 --> 01:14:19,288
So now do you believe me?

714
01:14:22,026 --> 01:14:24,392
This is an emergency situation. So please...

715
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,693
...clear the room. Do it.

716
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,229
He's going for the oil.

717
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:33,229
The one pipeline the West is counting on to supply our reserves.

718
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:35,601
Do you have an idea?

719
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:36,865
Maybe.

720
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:41,002
How far is the rig from the terminal? How fast is it traveling?

721
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:45,949
It's 1 06 miles from the terminal, going 70 miles an hour.

722
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:48,185
We have 78 minutes. Is there another rig?

723
01:14:48,386 --> 01:14:51,082
There's one parked in the passageway ahead of it.

724
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:54,086
-Charles, can you get me out there? -Of course.

725
01:14:55,259 --> 01:14:57,955
Wait. Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?

726
01:14:58,162 --> 01:15:01,359
-What do I need to defuse a bomb? -Me.

727
01:15:14,112 --> 01:15:14,942
There it is.

728
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,377
Hatch to the passageway.

729
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:25,016
You keep the speed up so the other rig catches up with us.

730
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:26,850
-I'll wait to hear from you. -Gotcha.

731
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,786
You know how to drive this thing?

732
01:15:29,994 --> 01:15:33,122
Doesn't exactly take a degree in nuclear physics.

733
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:42,996
They're in the pipeline.

734
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,131
They're on the move.

735
01:16:01,392 --> 01:16:02,586
Faster!

736
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,926
If there's the slightest chance, Bond will succeed.

737
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:15,296
He's the best we have...

738
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,467
...though I'd never tell him.

739
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:20,505
I hope you're right.

740
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:25,413
Here it comes!

741
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,681
It's closing up. Faster!

742
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:38,818
Sit tight.

743
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:56,236
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

744
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,663
It's a tactical fission device.

745
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,889
Low yield. Hold me steady.

746
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,634
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

747
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:20,360
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

748
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:24,040
Life's full of small challenges.

749
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:26,210
Have a look at this.

750
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:28,044
Someone stripped the screw heads.

751
01:17:29,947 --> 01:17:32,108
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

752
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:54,798
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

753
01:17:55,606 --> 01:17:58,200
So what are you saying? It couldn't go nuclear?

754
01:17:58,442 --> 01:18:02,208
There's still enough explosive to kill us both if the trigger goes off.

755
01:18:02,647 --> 01:18:04,342
-Let it blow. -But I can stop it.

756
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:05,538
Let it blow!

757
01:18:11,889 --> 01:18:12,981
Trust me. Leave it.

758
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:18,891
Move down. Move down!

759
01:18:19,163 --> 01:18:20,323
Jump! Go on, jump!

760
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:24,398
Jump!

761
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:40,878
Robinson's reporting.

762
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,353
The bomb was a dud.

763
01:18:44,388 --> 01:18:47,789
But the triggering charge blew out a 50-yard section of the pipe.

764
01:18:47,992 --> 01:18:49,084
And Bond?

765
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:51,150
Nothing.

766
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:54,521
I'm so sorry.

767
01:18:57,435 --> 01:18:59,164
But I have a gift for you.

768
01:18:59,971 --> 01:19:02,098
Something that belonged to my father.

769
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,436
He would've wanted you to have it.

770
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:06,873
Perhaps this isn't the time.

771
01:19:07,879 --> 01:19:09,039
Please.

772
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:13,511
He often spoke of how compassionately...

773
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:17,981
...you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping.

774
01:19:21,759 --> 01:19:23,420
It's very valuable, you know.

775
01:19:24,262 --> 01:19:26,822
I couldn't let it explode with the rest of him.

776
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:35,366
I was very upset when the money didn't kill both of you.

777
01:19:36,107 --> 01:19:38,439
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

778
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:42,507
Then you dropped the answer right in my lap.

779
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:44,079
Bond.

780
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:47,482
And as you say, he's the best you have.

781
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:49,710
Or should I say, ''had''?

782
01:19:56,093 --> 01:19:57,617
Take her to the helicopter.

783
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:05,833
Come on, give me your hand.

784
01:20:06,037 --> 01:20:07,231
Jump, jump!

785
01:20:08,706 --> 01:20:10,640
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

786
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:13,366
I could've stopped it. You almost killed us.

787
01:20:13,611 --> 01:20:15,010
I did kill us.

788
01:20:15,646 --> 01:20:18,911
She thinks we're dead, and she thinks she got away with it.

789
01:20:19,116 --> 01:20:22,552
Do you wanna put that in English for those of us who don't speak ''spy''?

790
01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:23,845
Who's ''she''?

791
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:25,215
Elektra King.

792
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:27,550
Why would she blow up her own pipeline?

793
01:20:27,758 --> 01:20:29,248
It makes her look innocent.

794
01:20:31,095 --> 01:20:34,087
The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.

795
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:37,260
It looks like a terrorist attack.

796
01:20:37,468 --> 01:20:39,698
But why leave this half?

797
01:20:40,071 --> 01:20:43,700
So there's enough to spread around to cover up what they did take.

798
01:20:43,908 --> 01:20:45,933
What will they do with the other half?

799
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:48,611
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

800
01:20:48,813 --> 01:20:51,577
-You're the scientist, you tell me. -I don't know.

801
01:20:52,683 --> 01:20:56,016
But the world's greatest terrorist running around with 6 kilos...

802
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,847
...of plutonium can't be good.

803
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:00,523
I have to get it back, or somebody will have my ass.

804
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:04,693
First things first.

805
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:08,865
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

806
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:11,899
By the way, before we go any further...

807
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:13,827
...I just wanna know....

808
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:17,072
What's the story with you and Elektra?

809
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:19,936
We're strictly platonic. Now.

810
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:22,372
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

811
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,148
What's your story?

812
01:21:26,717 --> 01:21:28,844
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

813
01:21:29,053 --> 01:21:32,113
Avoiding those kind of questions, just like you.

814
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:35,250
I read you, 007. Red alert.

815
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:37,518
M is missing with Elektra. Three men down.

816
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,628
Await instructions. Out.

817
01:21:41,298 --> 01:21:42,287
What do we do now?

818
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:49,170
I may have overlooked one critical element.

819
01:21:49,473 --> 01:21:51,407
What? More plutonium?

820
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:53,367
Beluga.

821
01:21:54,145 --> 01:21:55,510
Caviar.

822
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:26,507
Brought me something?

823
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,814
The power to reshape the world.

824
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:39,278
Go on.

825
01:22:40,024 --> 01:22:41,048
It's safe.

826
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:44,220
Touch your destiny.

827
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,400
I have brought something for you as well.

828
01:23:06,884 --> 01:23:08,579
Your present.

829
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:11,413
Courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

830
01:23:12,156 --> 01:23:13,384
My executioner.

831
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,725
Overpraise, I'm afraid.

832
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:19,094
-But my people will finish the job. -Your people?

833
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:22,598
Your people will leave you here to rot...

834
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:25,426
...just like you left me.

835
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:27,300
You and my father.

836
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:29,564
-Your father-- -My father was nothing.

837
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:32,698
His kingdom he stole from my mother.

838
01:23:33,811 --> 01:23:36,712
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

839
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:47,957
I hope you're proud of what you did to her.

840
01:23:49,226 --> 01:23:51,694
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

841
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:54,763
When I took her...

842
01:23:55,299 --> 01:23:57,290
...she was promise itself.

843
01:23:57,968 --> 01:24:00,562
You left her at the mercy of a man like me.

844
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:03,366
You ruined her.

845
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:04,904
For what?

846
01:24:05,409 --> 01:24:06,740
To get to me?

847
01:24:07,344 --> 01:24:08,936
She's worth 50 of me.

848
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,114
For once, I agree with you.

849
01:24:15,019 --> 01:24:17,544
And now we also share a common fate.

850
01:24:18,322 --> 01:24:19,152
You will die...

851
01:24:19,857 --> 01:24:21,882
...along with everyone in this city...

852
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,521
...and the bright, starry, oil-driven future of the West.

853
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:36,268
Since you sent your man to kill me...

854
01:24:36,574 --> 01:24:39,099
...I've been watching time tick slowly away...

855
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:42,270
...marching toward my own death.

856
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,009
Now you can have the same pleasure.

857
01:24:52,156 --> 01:24:53,885
Watch these hands, M.

858
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:56,654
By noon tomorrow...

859
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:58,623
...your time is up.

860
01:25:00,364 --> 01:25:02,059
And I guarantee you...

861
01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:04,093
...I will not miss.

862
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:28,281
So beautiful.

863
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:31,292
So smooth.

864
01:25:32,696 --> 01:25:34,129
So warm.

865
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:36,555
How would you know?

866
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:43,338
Why are you like this?

867
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,505
Because Bond is dead?

868
01:25:47,845 --> 01:25:49,369
It's what you wanted.

869
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:52,515
Of course it's what I wanted.

870
01:25:57,655 --> 01:25:58,781
He was....

871
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:03,389
He was a good lover?

872
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:05,694
What do you think?

873
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:07,887
I wouldn't feel anything?

874
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:23,980
I feel nothing.

875
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:41,656
What about this?

876
01:26:52,476 --> 01:26:53,943
But surely...

877
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:58,106
...you can feel this?

878
01:27:04,955 --> 01:27:06,252
Remember...

879
01:27:09,126 --> 01:27:10,388
...pleasure?

880
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,033
Wait here.

881
01:28:00,077 --> 01:28:01,305
Always something.

882
01:28:01,545 --> 01:28:02,705
First the casino.

883
01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:04,743
Now the caviar factory.

884
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:07,508
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

885
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:24,964
Bond is alive.

886
01:28:30,908 --> 01:28:33,206
Is nothing in this place straight?

887
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:39,512
Who are you?

888
01:28:40,117 --> 01:28:41,482
And how did you get in?

889
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:43,347
I'll call security...

890
01:28:44,154 --> 01:28:46,315
...and congratulate them.

891
01:28:46,657 --> 01:28:47,487
Drink?

892
01:28:50,928 --> 01:28:53,522
Can't you say hello like a normal person?

893
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,530
Get lost.

894
01:28:57,301 --> 01:28:59,895
No, no, no. Down the back.

895
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,900
What's your business with Elektra?

896
01:29:04,808 --> 01:29:08,300
I thought you were the one giving her the business.

897
01:29:08,512 --> 01:29:11,879
She drops $1 million in your casino, and you don't even blink.

898
01:29:12,115 --> 01:29:13,946
What's she paying you off for?

899
01:29:15,018 --> 01:29:18,476
You know, if I were you, a relationship with a man like that...

900
01:29:19,122 --> 01:29:20,384
...I wouldn't bet on it.

901
01:29:24,394 --> 01:29:26,885
$5000 of beluga. Ruined.

902
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:30,032
That's nothing compared to what a nuclear bomb can do.

903
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:33,129
We had a nuclear bomb stolen this morning.

904
01:29:33,337 --> 01:29:35,669
Renard and Elektra King are working together.

905
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:38,137
-I didn't know. -Well, what do you know?!

906
01:32:01,752 --> 01:32:03,344
Q's not gonna like this.

907
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,340
Get out!

908
01:34:46,483 --> 01:34:47,279
Help!

909
01:34:47,517 --> 01:34:48,415
Now...

910
01:34:49,386 --> 01:34:50,318
...where were we?

911
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,511
-A rope, please! -No. The truth.

912
01:34:52,756 --> 01:34:53,723
She has M.

913
01:34:53,924 --> 01:34:57,087
-I know nothing. -Those blades were meant for you.

914
01:34:57,294 --> 01:34:59,660
What does Elektra King want you dead for?

915
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,296
It was you who destroyed my factory.

916
01:35:02,499 --> 01:35:04,433
Then you drown my Rolls-Royce...

917
01:35:04,634 --> 01:35:08,126
...and now you're trying to drown me in my own caviar!

918
01:35:08,338 --> 01:35:09,737
Let me out!

919
01:35:10,173 --> 01:35:13,336
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

920
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:14,805
Or sour cream.

921
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:19,011
Occasionally...

922
01:35:19,683 --> 01:35:22,982
...I get equipment for her. Machinery. Russian stuff.

923
01:35:23,854 --> 01:35:25,583
And the payoff in the casino?

924
01:35:26,089 --> 01:35:27,317
It was a special job.

925
01:35:28,124 --> 01:35:30,115
My nephew is in the navy.

926
01:35:31,194 --> 01:35:34,391
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

927
01:35:34,598 --> 01:35:36,429
-Where? -Absolutely not!

928
01:35:36,633 --> 01:35:37,657
Where?!

929
01:35:41,037 --> 01:35:43,198
-Where? -Istanbul!

930
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:53,645
You!

931
01:35:53,884 --> 01:35:56,250
Where have you been, you gold-encrusted buffoon?

932
01:35:56,453 --> 01:35:59,183
Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.

933
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:02,881
Get me out of here, I'll show you what a bumped head feels like.

934
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,752
Look.

935
01:36:04,961 --> 01:36:08,397
We have no roof, but at least we have four good walls.

936
01:36:20,377 --> 01:36:24,336
The insurance company is never going to believe this.

937
01:37:25,709 --> 01:37:29,941
This used to be the KGB's Istanbul safe house. Now it's FSB.

938
01:37:30,146 --> 01:37:31,909
Federal Security Bureau.

939
01:37:32,115 --> 01:37:34,743
Same old friendly service with a new name.

940
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:37,252
-Did you raise Nikoli? -Nothing.

941
01:37:37,454 --> 01:37:39,979
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

942
01:37:41,725 --> 01:37:42,783
Tragedy.

943
01:37:43,293 --> 01:37:45,693
In the old days, there were 1 00 places...

944
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:48,329
...where a submarine could surface undetected.

945
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:49,361
Submarine?

946
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:52,301
What class is your nephew running?

947
01:37:53,203 --> 01:37:55,364
Victor 3, you call it.

948
01:37:55,572 --> 01:37:59,030
Nuclear. He's not loading cargo. They want the sub to use the reactor.

949
01:37:59,242 --> 01:38:00,072
That's it.

950
01:38:00,276 --> 01:38:03,211
Put weapons-grade plutonium in that sub's reactor...

951
01:38:03,413 --> 01:38:05,779
...instant, catastrophic meltdown.

952
01:38:05,982 --> 01:38:08,746
Making it all look just like an accident.

953
01:38:08,985 --> 01:38:10,179
But why?

954
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:14,123
Because the existing pipelines from the Caspian Sea...

955
01:38:14,357 --> 01:38:16,882
...go to the north. Here.

956
01:38:17,093 --> 01:38:21,291
The oil is put on the tankers, shipped across the Black Sea to Istanbul.

957
01:38:21,798 --> 01:38:24,130
The explosion would destroy Istanbul...

958
01:38:24,834 --> 01:38:27,462
...contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

959
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:30,331
There'd be one way to get the oil out.

960
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,940
Down south to the Med.

961
01:38:33,143 --> 01:38:34,474
The King pipeline.

962
01:38:35,078 --> 01:38:36,170
Elektra's pipeline.

963
01:38:36,379 --> 01:38:38,142
We must find Nikoli.

964
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:41,382
Captain Nikoli?

965
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:44,384
Sir.

966
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:47,046
Ready to load your cargo.

967
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:50,453
-We have only a few hours. -You came with skeleton crew?

968
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,685
-That's all we can afford. -Of course.

969
01:38:53,096 --> 01:38:55,394
Some brandy and refreshments for your men.

970
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,492
Thank you.

971
01:39:03,773 --> 01:39:04,705
Good morning.

972
01:39:09,546 --> 01:39:10,877
What's the time?

973
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:26,428
It's time for you to die.

974
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:00,428
I've got something.

975
01:40:01,364 --> 01:40:03,127
On the emergency frequency.

976
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:05,927
Two six-digit numbers cycled every 1 5 seconds.

977
01:40:06,136 --> 01:40:08,001
A GPS signal. Position coordinates.

978
01:40:08,204 --> 01:40:10,069
Locator card. M.

979
01:40:13,476 --> 01:40:14,943
-Here. -Maiden's Tower.

980
01:40:15,445 --> 01:40:16,673
Have you been there?

981
01:40:17,147 --> 01:40:18,136
No. Mr. Bullion.

982
01:40:22,318 --> 01:40:23,376
Bomb!

983
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:31,759
Come on, come on.

984
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:46,872
After you.

985
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,043
I insist.

986
01:41:05,995 --> 01:41:07,895
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

987
01:41:15,772 --> 01:41:17,899
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

988
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:31,312
The extruder's in here.

989
01:41:33,223 --> 01:41:37,182
It'll take half an hour to set up the machine to make the plutonium rod.

990
01:41:44,033 --> 01:41:45,432
Put them in here.

991
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:56,740
The reactor is secured.

992
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,971
Everything is complete as planned.

993
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:05,150
-Is your helicopter ready? -It'll pick me up in half an hour.

994
01:42:08,658 --> 01:42:10,182
Then this is the end.

995
01:42:12,228 --> 01:42:13,786
This is the beginning.

996
01:42:14,864 --> 01:42:17,264
The world will never be the same.

997
01:42:30,246 --> 01:42:31,736
The future is yours.

998
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:34,914
Have fun with it.

999
01:42:51,868 --> 01:42:53,096
If you'd kept away...

1000
01:42:53,303 --> 01:42:56,704
...we might've met in a few years and become lovers once more.

1001
01:43:06,282 --> 01:43:07,214
Take her to Renard.

1002
01:43:10,586 --> 01:43:12,019
Pretty thing.

1003
01:43:12,989 --> 01:43:14,479
You had her too?

1004
01:43:19,262 --> 01:43:21,127
I could've given you the world.

1005
01:43:22,598 --> 01:43:24,190
The world is not enough.

1006
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:26,500
Foolish sentiment.

1007
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,694
Family motto.

1008
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:35,843
They were digging near here, and they found some very pretty vases.

1009
01:43:37,113 --> 01:43:39,240
They also found this chair.

1010
01:43:49,959 --> 01:43:52,894
I think we ignore the old ways at our peril...

1011
01:43:53,096 --> 01:43:54,358
...don't you?

1012
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:56,125
Where's M?

1013
01:43:56,632 --> 01:43:58,497
Soon she'll be everywhere.

1014
01:44:00,136 --> 01:44:01,034
All this...

1015
01:44:02,805 --> 01:44:05,069
...because you fell for Renard?

1016
01:44:08,044 --> 01:44:11,013
Five more turns and your neck will break.

1017
01:44:14,684 --> 01:44:17,152
I've always had a power over men.

1018
01:44:19,188 --> 01:44:23,522
When I realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers...

1019
01:44:23,926 --> 01:44:26,588
...I knew I had to form another alliance.

1020
01:44:28,064 --> 01:44:29,156
You...

1021
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:31,895
...turned Renard.

1022
01:44:33,169 --> 01:44:34,761
Just like you...

1023
01:44:35,004 --> 01:44:37,905
...only you were even easier.

1024
01:44:41,477 --> 01:44:43,138
I told him he had to hurt me.

1025
01:44:43,913 --> 01:44:46,006
He had to make it look real.

1026
01:44:46,849 --> 01:44:47,747
When he refused...

1027
01:44:49,218 --> 01:44:52,415
...I told him I would do it myself.

1028
01:44:58,027 --> 01:44:59,892
So you killed your father.

1029
01:45:00,863 --> 01:45:02,091
He killed me.

1030
01:45:03,933 --> 01:45:06,265
He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

1031
01:45:06,469 --> 01:45:08,733
Was this all about the oil?

1032
01:45:10,306 --> 01:45:12,103
It is my oil.

1033
01:45:12,942 --> 01:45:13,909
Mine...

1034
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,475
...and my family's.

1035
01:45:15,678 --> 01:45:18,806
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

1036
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:22,483
I'm going to redraw the map.

1037
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,018
And when I'm through, the whole world will know my name...

1038
01:45:26,222 --> 01:45:29,487
...my grandfather's name, the glory of my people!

1039
01:45:29,692 --> 01:45:33,219
No one will believe this meltdown was an accident.

1040
01:45:33,429 --> 01:45:35,158
They will all believe.

1041
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,293
You understand?

1042
01:45:38,735 --> 01:45:40,635
Nobody can resist me.

1043
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:48,467
You know what happens when a man is strangled?

1044
01:45:50,613 --> 01:45:52,478
It's not too late.

1045
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,580
Eight million people need not die.

1046
01:45:58,421 --> 01:46:01,083
You should've killed me when you had the chance.

1047
01:46:02,191 --> 01:46:03,852
But you couldn't. Not me.

1048
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,891
Not a woman you've loved.

1049
01:46:15,972 --> 01:46:18,463
You meant nothing to me.

1050
01:46:23,746 --> 01:46:24,576
One...

1051
01:46:26,015 --> 01:46:27,141
...last...

1052
01:46:29,152 --> 01:46:30,551
...screw.

1053
01:46:54,911 --> 01:46:55,741
Boss...

1054
01:46:56,813 --> 01:46:57,905
...you're alive.

1055
01:46:58,114 --> 01:46:59,376
So glad to see you.

1056
01:47:00,416 --> 01:47:01,508
Me too.

1057
01:47:07,557 --> 01:47:08,819
I'm looking for a sub.

1058
01:47:09,025 --> 01:47:12,256
It's big and black, and the driver is a good friend of mine.

1059
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,434
Bring it to me.

1060
01:47:20,737 --> 01:47:21,863
What a shame.

1061
01:47:22,372 --> 01:47:23,634
He's just gone.

1062
01:48:11,521 --> 01:48:13,580
Zukovsky really hated you.

1063
01:48:15,858 --> 01:48:18,554
Everything's under control up here. Are you ready?

1064
01:48:25,468 --> 01:48:27,095
Time to say good night.

1065
01:48:56,666 --> 01:48:57,997
You can't kill me.

1066
01:48:58,201 --> 01:48:59,725
Not in cold blood.

1067
01:49:29,298 --> 01:49:30,390
Call him off.

1068
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,098
I won't ask again.

1069
01:49:40,443 --> 01:49:41,808
Call him off.

1070
01:49:43,312 --> 01:49:44,574
Call him off!

1071
01:49:54,857 --> 01:49:56,449
You wouldn't kill me.

1072
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:58,490
You'd miss me.

1073
01:50:02,665 --> 01:50:03,757
Dive! Bond--

1074
01:50:10,172 --> 01:50:11,503
I never miss.

1075
01:51:19,742 --> 01:51:21,004
Where is she?

1076
01:51:40,796 --> 01:51:42,024
Thought I'd forgotten?

1077
01:52:15,264 --> 01:52:17,198
Level at 1 00 feet.

1078
01:52:17,633 --> 01:52:19,100
Hold her steady.

1079
01:52:29,445 --> 01:52:30,742
Level at 1 00 feet.

1080
01:52:36,185 --> 01:52:38,619
If we can force them up to the surface...

1081
01:52:38,821 --> 01:52:40,686
...they'll show up on the spy satellite...

1082
01:52:41,057 --> 01:52:42,524
...bring out the navy.

1083
01:52:53,169 --> 01:52:54,636
Come on. Get up!

1084
01:52:54,837 --> 01:52:55,929
Over there. Move!

1085
01:52:56,372 --> 01:52:57,600
Move! Go, go!

1086
01:52:57,807 --> 01:52:58,865
Get over there!

1087
01:52:59,075 --> 01:53:00,337
Stay!

1088
01:53:00,543 --> 01:53:01,373
Up!

1089
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:34,008
Get us level! Level!

1090
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:35,837
It's all smashed!

1091
01:53:36,045 --> 01:53:37,103
Christmas?

1092
01:53:38,581 --> 01:53:40,048
So we're going up then?

1093
01:53:40,549 --> 01:53:42,278
Slight miscalculation.

1094
01:53:54,396 --> 01:53:55,488
Hold on!

1095
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:59,567
Hold on, hold on.

1096
01:54:14,884 --> 01:54:16,249
Brace yourself.

1097
01:54:45,481 --> 01:54:46,675
It's flooding!

1098
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:49,043
Get up to the hatch.

1099
01:54:56,625 --> 01:54:58,354
Damn! Come on!

1100
01:54:59,161 --> 01:55:00,389
Go, go!

1101
01:55:25,521 --> 01:55:27,785
He's opened up the reactor!

1102
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:29,682
And locked himself in!

1103
01:55:29,892 --> 01:55:31,757
I have to get up there to him.

1104
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:33,286
We have one chance.

1105
01:55:33,762 --> 01:55:38,358
I'll get out and back in through the reactor room escape hatch.

1106
01:55:41,971 --> 01:55:45,930
When the light goes red, press this button so I can get back in.

1107
01:55:46,609 --> 01:55:48,076
James, it's too risky.

1108
01:55:48,277 --> 01:55:49,539
If I don't make it...

1109
01:55:49,745 --> 01:55:52,236
...use this chamber to get out. Close the hatch.

1110
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,177
Exhale all the way up. Close it.

1111
01:58:27,403 --> 01:58:28,392
Help!

1112
01:58:39,515 --> 01:58:40,709
Come on, come on!

1113
01:58:44,019 --> 01:58:45,884
We're safe from the radiation...

1114
01:58:46,088 --> 01:58:48,318
...if the reactor coolant doesn't burst.

1115
01:58:49,058 --> 01:58:51,754
If he had gotten the plutonium rod in the reactor...

1116
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,326
...we could've written off the whole city.

1117
01:58:58,567 --> 01:59:00,501
Welcome to my nuclear family.

1118
01:59:27,162 --> 01:59:29,630
Are you really gonna commit suicide for her?

1119
01:59:29,832 --> 01:59:32,232
You forget, I'm already dead.

1120
01:59:32,534 --> 01:59:33,466
Haven't you heard?

1121
01:59:34,603 --> 01:59:36,036
So is she.

1122
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:40,573
You're lying.

1123
01:59:42,244 --> 01:59:43,768
Liar!

1124
01:59:45,481 --> 01:59:46,607
Liar!

1125
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:10,229
She's waiting for you.

1126
02:01:28,684 --> 02:01:30,584
The hydrogen gas level's too high.

1127
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,481
One spark and the reactor'll blow.

1128
02:01:33,722 --> 02:01:35,280
I have to stop it.

1129
02:01:38,961 --> 02:01:41,759
Go to the top of the sub. Meet me in the torpedo bay.

1130
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:49,594
The reactor is flooded.

1131
02:01:51,473 --> 02:01:54,135
So it's safe even if this place blows.

1132
02:02:38,287 --> 02:02:40,016
No, it's simply not the case.

1133
02:02:41,723 --> 02:02:42,621
Before that.

1134
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,624
Any word?

1135
02:02:50,265 --> 02:02:51,755
Still no contact.

1136
02:02:56,238 --> 02:02:58,604
Always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.

1137
02:03:01,143 --> 02:03:02,667
Was that a Christmas joke?

1138
02:03:02,878 --> 02:03:04,539
From me? No.

1139
02:03:05,314 --> 02:03:06,372
Never.

1140
02:03:07,149 --> 02:03:09,549
So isn't it time you unwrapped your present?

1141
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:11,184
Oh, I think so.

1142
02:03:16,024 --> 02:03:17,548
Look. What's that?

1143
02:03:18,493 --> 02:03:20,120
-The card. -He must be nearby.

1144
02:03:20,329 --> 02:03:21,227
Where?

1145
02:03:24,566 --> 02:03:25,794
-Where? -It picks up...

1146
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:28,231
...body heat, so humans come out orange.

1147
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:31,406
There.

1148
02:03:34,609 --> 02:03:37,169
I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?

1149
02:03:42,184 --> 02:03:43,173
It's getting redder.

1150
02:03:57,366 --> 02:04:00,494
Must be a premature form of the millennium bug.

1151
02:04:03,405 --> 02:04:04,929
I was wrong about you.

1152
02:04:07,075 --> 02:04:08,269
How so?
