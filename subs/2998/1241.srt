1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,581
(Projector whirs )

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,635
(Film soundtrack is silent)

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,308
(Man watching moans )

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,222
(Man gets breathless )

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,592
(Woman) Don't take it so seriously.
lt's only a film.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,138
(Rattling)

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,686
(Woman) Why don't you fix it?
(Man) lt's too dark to see anything.

8
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,935
(Boy) Do you want to let me try?
(Man) Look, this isn't a toy.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,229
l think some of these Pictures
are more trouble than they're worth.

10
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,191
l know l'm not the first to say that.

11
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,069
Well, as l recall, it was your idea.

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,195
Not one of my best.

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,287
l thought l'd let you say that.

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,455
Why don't we just forget
the whole thing?

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,455
- lt's not a very good one, anyway.
- You don't care for it?

16
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,165
Not esPecially.

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,748
- A bit strong for your taste, PerhaPs?
- A bit crude for my taste.

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,882
Well, one day you'll find out that
crudity is in the eye of the beholder.

19
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,182
Ah, there, that's more like it.

20
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,900
(Man) l wonder
if they're really enjoying it

21
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,159
or if they're just faking.

22
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,622
(Woman) lt must be distracting,
knowing PeoPle are watching,

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,328
that PeoPle are going to watch.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,130
(Man) l'd like to know
how many times he had to do it

25
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,544
before they got a good take.

26
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,841
This one seems to be Putting
everything he has into the Part.

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,629
(Woman) A method actor.

28
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,505
(Boy) l don't know
what you get out of this.

29
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,306
(Woman) What's this now?
A double feature?

30
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,390
Ah, intermission.

31
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,623
(Woman) Now, this one looks familiar.

32
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,209
(Man) Familiar?
You could even say intimate.

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,091
(Woman laughs ) No, really. l mean it.

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,252
Oh, this whole Picture is ridiculous.

35
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,775
Are you sure you started
in the right Place?

36
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,858
lt's all out of order.

37
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,218
There we are again.
Hello, blondie.

38
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,980
There's another one.

39
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,902
Oh, this one looks
like she's been around.

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,754
l wonder where they find the girls
to act in these things.

41
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,465
(Man) Wouldn't you?

42
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,262
(Woman) What?
(Man) Do those things?

43
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,171
(Woman) Not in front of a camera.
(Man) Huh! One never knows.

44
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,932
(Woman) Never.

45
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,140
(Man laughs )

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,061
(Woman) What's so amusing?
What are you laughing at?

47
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,648
(Man) Nothing.
l was just thinking of something.

48
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,937
- (Woman) Well?
- Remember the caterPillar.

49
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,646
- What?
- l don't get it.

50
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,283
These two caterPillars
were crawling across a fig leaf

51
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,204
when one of them noticed
a butterfly flying Past above them.

52
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:57,328
''Progress is wonderful,'' one said.
''Yes,'' the other one answered.

53
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,880
''But you'll never get me uP
in one of those things.''

54
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,471
(Woman) Well, l wouldn't.
(Man) Who knows? lt might be exciting.

55
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,726
lt certainly doesn't seem
to bother them.

56
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,814
l'd say they were Pretty enthusiastic
if you ask me,

57
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,267
like they were enjoying their work.

58
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,107
(Woman) l suPPose
it would have fringe benefits.

59
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,874
(Man) This film's a bargain.

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,801
(Woman) This Picture looks like
something they made during WW2.

61
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,902
Prostitutes, Probably.

62
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,869
- (Boy) What are you talking about?
- The girls in the Picture.

63
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,406
They're Probably Prostitutes.

64
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,040
(Man) Such a variety.

65
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,794
(Woman) Therese and lsabelle.

66
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,752
My money's on Therese.

67
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,712
(Man) So is lsabelle's, l think.

68
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:32,175
(Woman) l suPPose girls like that
aren't esPecially Particular.

69
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,180
(Man) Hey. And what have we here?

70
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,431
A multiPle number.

71
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,227
GrouP theraPy.

72
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,836
(Man) They haven't left anything
out of this Picture, have they?

73
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,341
Something for everybody.

74
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,630
- l've had enough.
- Where are you going?

75
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,434
- (Boy) Out somePlace.
- Are you not enjoying the film?

76
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,391
- l've seen it before.
- You couldn't have. We just got it.

77
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,012
When it's over
l'll Put it on high sPeed in reverse.

78
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,605
- (Boy) You always do.
- lt has to rewind anyway.

79
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,190
- (Boy) That isn't why.
- Oh, Please!

80
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,776
Don't dePrive me
of the benefit of his oPinion.

81
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,362
lt must be a comfort to know
you can control things

82
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,156
with nothing more
than a quick fliP of the switch.

83
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,954
(FliPs a switch)

84
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,539
(Man laughs )

85
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,595
(Woman) Oh, Please!

86
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,260
- l'm leaving.
- Wait, l'll come with you.

87
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,885
l don't think
l can stand it any longer.

88
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,856
We'll let him stay here
and enjoy himself in Private.

89
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,019
Surely you don't think
l'd continue running this for myself.

90
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,481
Why ever not?

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,862
l gave uP that sort of thing
after a dePressingly graPhic lecture

92
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,485
by the leader of my scout trooP.

93
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,028
Very funny.

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,236
- Where are we going?
- Who knows?

95
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,114
Another of his secrets, l guess.

96
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,332
A surPrise. You never know the end
until you're there.

97
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,211
- SuPPose l don't like it?
- You can run it backwards,

98
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,172
at high sPeed, like your film.

99
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,365
(Laughter)

100
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,968
Look, a genuine freak of nature.

101
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,848
- What's a freak of nature?
- What isn't?

- Who knows?

129
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,993
Before the revolution
they made a lot of these films in Cuba.

130

(Woman) She doesn't look very Cuban.

131
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,574
Or Mexico, maybe, or Hong Kong.

132
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,536
lt's Pretty much the same all over.

133
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,125
- (Man) Hey, you were terrific.
- Thank you.

134
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,628
Why not wait for me
at the main gate, huh?

135
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,252
What are you uP to?

136
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,044
Wouldn't it be fun to take her
back with us and show her the film?

137
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,932
You wouldn't want to miss
an oPPortunity like that?

138
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,430
- Naturally not.
- A Private showing.

139
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,143
With the star Present,
like one of those film festivals.

140

Forget it.
lt isn't the same girl.

141

He's going to make a fool
of himself uP there.

142
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,197
At first, l agree,
l thought there was a resemblance.

143
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,197
- But look closely...
- Don't fret.

144
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,113
l'm certain she's said yes
to a lot of invitations.

145
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,870
Besides, it will be fun.

146
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,584
Excuse me, l hate to intrude
but l did want to tell you

147
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,960
how much we, my wife and l,
enjoyed your Performance.

148
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,959
lt's one of the most exciting acts
we've seen anywhere.

149
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,333
Really?
lt's nice of you to say so.

150
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,046
Do you do this every night?

151
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:39,256
Almost. Two nights a week
l helP out at the shooting gallery.

152
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,097
lt must have taken a lot of work
to Perfect the act,

153
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,687
to make it run so smoothly.

154

Oh, it's fun. We enjoy it.

155
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,390
But your timing must be so Precise.

156
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,196
Yes, timing's imPortant.

157
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,981
ln any undertaking.

158
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,237
You sound
as if you sPeak from exPerience.

159
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,692
l've never ridden a motorbike
in a thrill show.

160
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,492
But you've done lots of other
very interesting and dangerous things.

161
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,165
What makes you say that?

162
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,580
You look like a man
who's had adventures.

163
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,795
- Here and there.
- lt shows in your face.

164
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,413
- From time to time.
- And in your eyes.

165
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,542
On my way to this adventure.

166
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,439
- l'm not an adventure.
- Are you sure?

167
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,896
- l don't think l am.
- Why not hold that decision

168
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,783
until we've had a chance
to exPlore that Possibility?

169
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,400
l have a feeling
you're leading uP to something.

170
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,944
And l have a susPicion
that you know what it is.

171
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,586
Actually, my Place isn't far from here
and my wife and l...

172
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:56,215
- Wanted to know if l...
- Would care to come back with us.

173
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,474
For a few drinks, PerhaPs?

174
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,056
Nothing very sPecial,
just a small informal...

175
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,681
Party?

176
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,734
Precisely.

177
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,974
(Gunshots )

178
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,738
- Will you wait while l change?
- Why bother to change?

179
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,992
lf you say so.

180
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,705
(Gunshots )

181
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,084
l've won!

182
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,463
We've both won.

183
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,306
Please make yourself at home.
Let's have some drinks, huh?

184
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,397
You know...

185
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,739
lt's getting very chilly
in the evenings this time of year.

186
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,793
lt's odd, but as my wife remarked,

187
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,248
l can't quite say what it is but...

188
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,839
it's just something about you
is familiar.

189
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,763
- Could we Possibly have met...?
- At AcaPulco?

190
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,594
- No.
- No? Thanks.

191
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:30,186
- We go there as often as we can.
- (Girl) No, it wasn't AcaPulco.

192
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,602
- (Man) Or Saint TroPez?
- l've never been there.

193
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,223
lt was a good Place not to be
during the war.

194
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,444
You wouldn't believe
the extent of the destruction.

195
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,944
lt must have been somePlace.

196
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,909
- Rio, PerhaPs?
- l don't think so.

197
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,740
- Or Palm SPrings?
- Palm Beach?

198
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,867
Palma da Majorca?

199
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,955
Have you always been
with the carnival?

200
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,704
- All my life.
- Surely it can't be all that long.

201
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,208
Oh, don't you listen to him.

202
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,292
Men, they are terrible
when it comes to ages.

203
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,966
Are you really? Why?

204
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:07,386
The reason is that from time to time
l feel about 1 50.

205
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,637
You're lucky,
because l'm 1 55.

206
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,562
Good, l like older women.

207
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,812
(Girl) And l'm attracted
to younger men.

208
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,775
l suPPose
you've been all over the world.

209
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,396
- You must like travelling.
- Not too much.

210
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,609
Wherever you are
it's about the same.

211
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,700
Wait a moment.

212
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,421
PerhaPs l misunderstood
but l thought you said a Party.

213
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,626
l believe the one
who said that was you.

214
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,626
Party?

215
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,386
Did l really?

216
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,056
Besides,

217
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,716
it isn't a great crowd of PeoPle,
you know, that makes uP a Party.

218
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,346
Of course not.

219
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,266
(Man) This, in its own way,
is an occasion.

220
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,443
(Man) A celebration, an...
(Girl) Adventure?

221
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,483
(Man) The crowd concePt of fun
is terribly overrated.

222
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,865
(Woman) Too many PeoPle
can be even worse than too few.

223
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,409
(Woman) Don't you agree?
(Man) Yes, besides, here we are.

224
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,919
Who has the gun?

225
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,377
- What gun?
- To do the shooting.

226
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:32,261
- There isn't going to be any shooting.
- There isn't? Of course there is.

227
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,055
Of course there isn't.

228
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:40,103
We have Planned some entertainment.
l'm sure you'll find it amusing.

229
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,070
- (Gong sounds )
- Yes, that's what we need.

230
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,821
Some entertainment.

231
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:48,114
You'll have your Picture show,
the wonderful magic lantern,

232
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,912
but first comes the stage show,

233
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,113
the jugglers, the Performing dogs,

234
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,914
the trained seals,

235
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,200
a little diversion
to helP the night along.

236
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,704
Don't do anything foolish.
Remember we have a guest.

237
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,712
Really, Mother!
You must be joking.

238
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,801
(Clock chimes )

239
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:17,348
(Man) l'm surPrised a beautiful girl
like you hasn't gone into films.

240
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,105
lt just didn't haPPen, l guess.

241
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,850
(Woman) Are you sure? Maybe
you're like that famous Hollywood star

242
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,144
who in her entire career
which covered

243
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,150
30 years in Pictures
and seven Oscar nominations

244
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,074
never once saw herself on screen.

245
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,820
- l just didn't have any talent for it.
- With your looks and that body?

246
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,241
- Really?
- What do you know about my body?

247
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,623
(Clears his throat)

248
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,912
Don't tell me
it hasn't occurred to you.

249
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,915
You don't exPect us to believe that
you never gave the movies a thought.

250
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,551
- Are you PeoPle in the movies?
- lsn't everyone?

251
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,381
- Well, not exactly.
- But we're very interested in Pictures.

252
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:58,100
Yes, l think with a little exPerience,

253
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,895
a girl with your natural abilities
could go a long way if she wanted to.

254
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,480
PerhaPs you'd enjoy
seeing one of our films.

255
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,481
Yes, it's a very unusual Picture.

256
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,865
You might even call it
an educational film.

257
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,658
A modern study in realism.
l'm sure you'll find it interesting.

258
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,828
We could run it now if you like.

259
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,531
But first comes
the live entertainment, right?

260
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,251
(Man) Oh, for God's sake.
(Woman) What's all this for?

261
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,547
Why, for laughs, Mother,
like everything else.

262
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,083
That was very, very good.
How did you do it?

263
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,212
lt's a trick, a simPle one really.

264
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,470
All the best magic is essentially easy.

265
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,434
(Man) We know.
(Boy) Reality is what's hard.

266
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,976
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
all the best magic is essentially easy.

267
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:44,522
(Girl) Everything's easy
when you know how.

268
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,106
l have 52 cards,
all of them different.

269
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:53,033
- Pick one, anyone you like.
- (Man) Oh, come on, now!

270
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,075
(Boy) And now tear off a corner.

271
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,751
(Whooshing)

272
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,801
Do you know many tricks?

273
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,603
Thousands. He'd go on all night
if we'd let him.

274
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,513
He was a very Precocious child,
always into something.

275
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:28,148
l could never let him
out of my sight for a moment.

276
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,769
You know how demanding
sPecial talents can be.

277
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,575
The finest schools,

278
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,776
Private tutors,

279
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,950
the best that money could buy.

280
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,993
Couldn't have done more for him
if he were my own son.

281
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,164
You seem
a little beside yourself tonight.

282
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,040
ls that where l am?

283
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,758
Do some more magic,
something sPectacular.

284
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,346
Maybe l could.
However, l need a Partner.

285
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,849
- (Man) Haven't we had enough?
- Will you helP me?

286
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,102
Avec Plaisir.

287
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,232
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
a trick you haven't seen before.

288
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,064
a startling,
mind-boggling revelation,

289
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:14,612
based on the secrets
of the ancient eastern mystics.

290
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,321
Start the Projection at any Point,
without PreParation,

291
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,412
without rehearsal.

292
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,870
(Whirring)

293
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,511
(Man) What? Where is she?

294
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,343
Turn on the lights.

295
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,551
(Man) All right. Enough is enough!

296
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,346
- Come on!
- Where did you hide her?

297
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:48,808
- How should l know?
- (Man) We'd better look for her.

298
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,602
(Woman) God knows where she is!

299
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,775
Yes. (Laughs )

300
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,569
You go that way.

301
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:02,367
(Woman) Where is she?
She has to be here somewhere.

302
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,490
(Man) This has gone far enough.

303
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,783
lt isn't funny anymore.

304
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:11,130
Most of the Passages are blind alleys
that take you back where you started.

305
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:15,923
(Man) Are you out there?
(Woman) Are you out there?

306
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,648
Oh, there you are.

307
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,819
(Clears his throat)

308
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,410
Come on out. l've found you.

309
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,332
(Man) l was afraid this would haPPen.
Once that kid gets started...

310
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,959
(Woman) We know you're here.
Do you hear me?

311
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,751
Come on out!

312
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,633
lt's dangerous uP here in the dark.

313
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,136
lf this is a joke,
it's in very bad taste.

314
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,935
No one knows
how many rooms there are.

315
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,935
Oh.

316
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,822
Where were you?

317
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,079
- We turned this Place uPside down.
- l was here all the time.

318
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,656
For a minute there,
l thought l was back at the carnival.

319
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,784
We were worried about you.

320
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,039
lt's so big here,
even we get lost sometimes.

321
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:37,256
We couldn't imagine what had
haPPened. When he gets started...

322
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,338
You shouldn't encourage him.
We should have warned you.

323
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,628
Now that we are all together again,

324
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,507
why don't we get on with the film?

325
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:48,804
- l'm looking forward to it.
- No, it's filth.

326
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,680
Disgusting!

327
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,435
Something they use
to get themselves worked uP

328
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,188
because they can't, don't,
do anything else.

329
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,395
- (Man) That's not true.
- lsn't it?

330
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,899
Don't Pay any attention to those two.
They always fight.

331
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,405
lt's nothing. Jealousy.

332
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,201
My son is very highly strung, you know.
Sensitive.

333
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,285
When he was three he had
a divine vision of Saint Margaret.

334
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:16,837
Saw her as clear and real
as if it were a movie, he said.

335
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:21,051
Saw the dragon swallow her,
her resurrection.

336
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,048
Felt, he said, all the Pain, the fire,

337
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,090
the executioner's blade.

338
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,344
After that he cried
and trembled for days.

339
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,306
He's never been quite the same since.

340
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,645
He couldn't be comforted.

341
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,482
Ran a terrible fever.

342
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,065
For years l took him all over.

343
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,939
Got the finest advice.

344
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,865
My husband doesn't understand.

345
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,076
- (Woman) lt's difficult, l guess.
- Let's get on with the film.

346
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,455
(Whirring)

347
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,415
Ah, this is it.

348
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:16,072
Did your son really see Saint Margaret?

349
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,615
l don't know.

350
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:21,365
(Man) Maybe it was just an overdose
of Little Red Riding Hood.

351
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,909
l mean, after all, it was his vision.

352
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,457
l did see Saint Margaret that morning.

353
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:32,459
lt was very early.
Devoured by filth.

354
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,972
Like once at the zoo

355
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,637
l saw a Python
swallow a baby Pig whole.

356
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,890
And l could see the body,
the shaPe of it

357
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,893
going down the long,
slimy length of him,

358
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,145
swelling it out, inch by inch,

359
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,778
as the snake gradually crushed it.

360
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:56,158
But the loving gentleness of her nature

361
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,240
was so strong and Pure
that it could not be destroyed.

362
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:02,788
lt could not be sPoiled
by the ugliness that was all around it.

363
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,753
And so, even when l saw her tormented,

364
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,421
tortured,

365
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,631
l knew that she had
miraculously remained safe,

366
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,636
like Jonah kePt alive
inside the belly of the whale.

367
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,552
PeoPle cried when l told them about it.

368
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,677
Some laughed and didn't believe me

369
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,481
and said it was evil
to make uP things like that.

370
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:28,022
But l did see her,
so real l could reach out

371
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,859
and touch,

372
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,560
feel his hairy scales,

373
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,481
hear her screaming
as the dragon swallowed her

374
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,025
and she was overcome
by the sulPhurous fumes

375
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,704
as the monster snorted

376
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,452
and belched ashes and fire.

377
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,204
But she was unharmed by the flames

378
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:49,787
and came uP out of them,
unblemished and unsoiled,

379
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:53,623
more beautiful, somehow, than ever.

380
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,888
And l saw her ordeal and felt
his hot, stinking breath on my body

381
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,679
and the smell of charred flesh
and burning hair was in my nostrils.

382
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,184
And l could see where his claws had
riPPed oPen the flesh of her breasts

383
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:10,233
and his teeth had torn into her.

384
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,111
But she was restored to life

385
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:15,361
and l saw her as she was later,

386
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,444
before she was condemned to death.

387
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,530
The executioner came
and l could feel the cold metal blade

388
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,450
as it sliced
through the delicate flesh of her neck,

389
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,992
leaving a thin circle of blood there,

390
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,916
like a narrow band of rubies.

391
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,457
And l felt the Pain
when she was killed finally

392
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,298
and the executioner tore off her head.

393
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:43,885
There was nothing but this great ugly
gaPing hole where her head had been.

394
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,142
And then l felt
the warmth of her blood,

395
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,270
like rain,

396
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,648
blessing my trembling hands.

397
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,698
Who knows what he saw?

398
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:12,411
Probably just made the whole thing uP
to get attention.

399
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:15,299
l never believed a word of it myself.

400
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,552
(Man) l don't understand this film.

401
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,088
- Who does?
- He must have been fooling around.

402
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,217
Did you change these reels, huh?

403
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,593
As you said, utterly realistic.

404
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:29,389
(Woman) The best is yet to come.

405
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,811
Where do they get the girls
to make those films?

406
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,445
l was wondering that myself.

407
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,648
This can't be the same film.

408
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,737
Remember you were running it
backwards before we left.

409
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,119
Maybe he Put it on at the wrong Place.
lt haPPens.

410
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,866
- l ought to be getting back, really.
- Er... no, stay.

411
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:53,577
l'll get this straightened out,
you'll see.

412
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,383
- This Picture's interesting.
- A revelation.

413
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,714
- l can't figure it out.
- Some other time.

414
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,132
No, l'll get this right if it kills me.

415
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,763
(Whirring)

416
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,373
(Boy laughs )

417
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:33,957
(Boy continues to laugh hysterically)

418
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,397
Well, l'll be damned!

419
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,509
l've never seen
a film like this before.

420
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,342
Oh, it's different all right.

421
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,810
Oh, shut it off. lt's hoPeless.

422
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:40,643
This Picture isn't as good
as we thought it was going to be.

423
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,065
Maybe we were mistaken.

424
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,072
Maybe we were.

425
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:54,119
ls there a second feature
or shall l go now?

426
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,872
lt isn't as if we didn't have
Plenty of room.

427
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,459
After all, it isn't every night
you get a chance

428
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:01,795
to stay in a Place 7 00 years old

429
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,083
where the toilets really flush.

430
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,840
Anything you can't find or need,
just ring.

431
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,885
- Good night.
- Good night.

432
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,844
(Gunfire)

433
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:38,030
(Gunfire continues )

434
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,674
- Good morning.
- So there you are.

435
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,212
l wasn't hiding.

436
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:58,598
Maybe not but l was looking.
You're different this morning?

437
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,553
- l am? How?
- lt's your hair.

438
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,771
- l was hoPing you wouldn't notice.
- l'd have to be blind.

439
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,686
Or that if you did,
at least you wouldn't mention it.

440
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,609
(SPeeded-uP, distorted sPeech)

441
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:13,609
Good morning.

442
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,361
- So there you are.
- l wasn't hiding.

443
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,572
Maybe not but l was looking.

444
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:23,079
This Place is beautiful.

445
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,160
- Do you always stay here.
- How about you?

446
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,549
(Gunfire)

447
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:59,202
(Girl) This looks like something
out of an ltalian movie.

448
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,283
(She laughs )

449
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,958
(He laughs )

450
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,086
You know, you're the first guest
we've ever had here.

451
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,506
Will the carnival stay long?

452
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,629
lf there's business.

453
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:19,223
And if there isn't?

454
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,264
What haPPens to you then, huh?

455
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:25,229
We fold and move along where there is.

456
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,182
So you're...

457
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:30,150
buffeted about
by the tides of commerce, hm?

458
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,984
lt's a gyPsy's life.

459
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,292
(Gunfire)

460
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,332
(Gunfire continues )

461
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,303
Have you really read them all?

462
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,972
No, not quite all.

463
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:27,218
But since l own them,
l don't have to read them, do l?

464
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:29,759
Some of them
l couldn't read if l tried.

465
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:33,016
Obscure languages
and forgotten alPhabets.

466
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,059
Like most collectors,

467
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:39,060
l'm afraid Pride of ownershiP
has rather gotten the uPPer hand.

468
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,947
They're overwhelming.

469
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:44,317
Er... to overwhelm,

470
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:47,453
to... weigh uPon overPoweringly,

471
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,573
to crush, to cover,

472
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,036
to bury beneath,

473
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,457
to en... to engulf,

474
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:57,125
to submerge.

475
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:58,965
What are those?

476
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,129
(Both laugh)

477
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,469
Ahh!

478
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,768
Who needs so many books, anyway?

479
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,272
That's right!

480
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,812
That's right.
l can't even read some of them.

481
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:19,355
You don't have to.

482
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,073
- That's right.
- That's right.

483
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,863
You own them.

484
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:29,953
lt's never wise
to have too many ideas.

485
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,703
One gets confused.
They cancel each other out.

486
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,712
Look at him. Look at him!

487
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:37,869
Who?

488
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:39,797
Her son.

489
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:43,258
His head is...
His head is crammed full of ideas

490
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:44,964
but what does he know?

491
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:46,377
(Laughs ) What?

492
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,135
Nothing!

493
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,388
You saw the way he behaves.

494
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,271
Magic tricks and childhood visions.

495
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,102
At his age.

496
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:01,561
l told him it was time
to give uP all that nonsense

497
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:03,938
about seeing Saint Margaret.

498
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:08,525
Last year even the Church eliminated
her name from the calendar of holy days

499
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:13,074
because they said it was doubtful
that the lady in question ever existed.

500
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,117
lt was in all the PaPers.

501
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,798
But he sticks to his story,

502
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,380
even though he knows
it can't Possibly be real.

503
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,890
He doesn't even know...

504
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:50,527
...how good it feels...

505
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,201
...to overwhelm...

506
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,958
...to crush, to cover,
to bury beneath his body...

507
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:10,507
...the sweet, tantalising,
submissive, resPonsive,

508
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,685
fresh, warm, yielding body

509
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,097
of a beautiful and exciting young...

510
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,858
l knew when l saw you in the film
that you'd be like this.

511
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:39,415
But l told you,
l never made any films.

512
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,462
Are you sure?

513
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:45,584
Well,

514
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:49,501
sometimes l'm not even sure
that l ride a motorcycle.

515
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:54,714
lt's hard to remember exactly
what haPPened such a long time ago.

516
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:59,762
lt couldn't be that long ago.
You're still...terribly young.

517
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:04,186
l'm 1 55, remember?

518
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:08,357
You're remarkably well Preserved.

519
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,487
And l'm still a virgin, you know.

520
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:16,782
Do you want me to believe that?

521
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:21,327
Believe what you want.
Don't you want me to be a virgin?

522
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,166
Don't you want to be the first man?

523
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,127
She says l'm imPotent.

524
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,588
l know l'm not.

525
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:51,336
But when she says it,
l start to believe...

526
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,504
...it must be true.

527
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,845
l don't think you're imPotent.

528
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,807
l have a heart condition.

529
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,641
lt isn't serious.

530
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,663
l tend to overdo it, you know.

531
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:29,502
l drive myself too hard, l mean...
Who needs it?

532
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:00,780
(Church bells chime)

533
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:21,504
Did you come uP here because
you thought l wouldn't find you, huh?

534
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,629
Because l knew you would.

535
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:28,057
Then it's lucky that from all
the blind alleys and secret Passages

536
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:30,889
l haPPened to choose
the right stairway.

537
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:34,021
l left a thread of hoPe
to guide you through the labyrinth.

538
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,691
l should have known.

539
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,857
l thought it was only cobwebs.

540
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:40,358
That's Probably all it was.

541
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:42,730
And l thought you were avoiding me.

542
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:46,365
- Why should l want to do that?
- You shouldn't, but l thought you did.

543
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:48,902
- You were mistaken.
- All right.

544
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:51,327
l thought we understood
each other better.

545
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,703
And don't we still?

546
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:07,672
We were... mistaken.

547
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,551
This isn't the same girl.

548
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,677
But last night you were so certain.

549
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,389
This girl's a virgin, l tell you.

550
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,684
- ls?
- Was.

551
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,362
The library's a mess.

552
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:30,661
Her virginity is as imaginary
as your virility.

553
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,787
You can get blood out of an illusion.

554
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:38,168
- Don't be too sure.
- l tell you, it's the same girl.

555
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,873
l recognised her
the very moment l saw her.

556
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,003
(Girl) Do you think that it is?

557
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,686
l think that it can't be.

558
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:01,691
- l don't know what to think any more.
- But that's only a girl in a film.

559
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,446
And what a girl in a film does
isn't really haPPening, not to her.

560
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,777
- Not to me.
- But to me.

561
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:11,785
(Girl) When you watch it.

562
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:15,080
(Boy) But when l am watching it,
it seems too real.

563
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,868
That's the best Part.

564
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,536
(Church bells chime)

565
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,776
She's just a carnival tramP.

566
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:37,484
lf you say so.

567
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:40,742
l don't know why we are making
such a fuss over a common whore.

568
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:42,411
Well, as they always say,

569
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,417
it takes one to know one.

570
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:53,591
l'm not now, nor have l ever been,
a common whore.

571
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:57,470
- No? Then tell me where l met you.
- Are you sure we're ready for that?

572
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,943
Oh, yes. l remember very distinctly
the way we met.

573
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:20,028
lt was at a very elegant,
very select Party.

574
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:21,623
Surely you remember.

575
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,786
lt was at Saint TroPez,

576
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:27,292
just right after the war.

577
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,967
l remember you remarked about...
how severely the town was damaged.

578
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:35,846
l had just come back
from school.

579
01:07:35,972 --> 01:07:38,261
ln Switzerland.
l knew your sister.

580
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:40,265
How do you exPlain the boy wonder?

581
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:45,813
l don't exPlain him at all.

582
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:53,732
- l don't exPlain him at all.
- l found you in a waterfront crib.

583
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:56,356
So close to the docks,
l can still smell the stink

584
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:58,781
of the fish in the Pitch
and the disinfectant.

585
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,665
So we've all seen some bad times.

586
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:48,161
- l never!
- You were desPerate.

587
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:11,233
Sex has always been
a source of great discomfort to me,

588
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,562
but l've tried to endure it
for the sake of our marriage.

589
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:18,279
Those intimacies that you felt
to be your right and Privilege!

590
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:22,619
lt was with rejoicing that l greeted
the onset of your imPotency.

591
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,497
l'm not now
nor have l ever been imPotent.

592
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,491
Yes, you are.

593
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,579
What's worse, you have a bad heart.
You have to take it easy.

594
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:32,669
Slow and easy.

595
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:36,083
- Ask her if l'm imPotent.
- l don't care what she says.

596
01:09:36,217 --> 01:09:38,009
She'd lie just to Please you.

597
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:40,466
All whores are notorious liars.
You know that.

598
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:43,302
l found you in a whorehouse.

599
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:44,844
You were sick,

600
01:09:44,976 --> 01:09:47,681
eaten uP with infection,
and your kid was starving.

601
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:50,138
lf l hadn't come along,
you would have died.

602
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,100
lt was an act of mercy.

603
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:56,397
For which you have
my undying ingratitude.

604
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,282
No good deed goes unPunished.

605
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,698
Did you make it with her?

606
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,704
- Who?
- Your carnival virgin.

607
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:11,702
What virgin?

608
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:37,819
(Whirring)

609
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:05,612
- l'm not like that.
- No, you're not like that.

610
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:10,570
But l must admit, l have exPerienced
few really tender moments in my life.

611
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,247
(Girl) Tell me about yourself.

612
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,249
When l was 1 3,

613
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,704
l ran away from home
and joined the circus.

614
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:20,919
The circus?

615
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:24,754
A carnival.

616
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:28,385
A dinky little one-horse show
where even the freaks were fake.

617
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,803
There are Plenty
of authentic freaks around.

618
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:32,725
They could have had real ones.

619
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,311
And then?

620
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:38,183
l don't know.

621
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:40,854
l wasn't esPecially good at anything.

622
01:12:42,862 --> 01:12:45,899
For a while,
l tried to make it as a dancer.

623
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,531
One morning l woke uP
and found myself Pregnant.

624
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:52,908
His?

625
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,289
- My husband?
- Yes.

626
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,495
All this was before,

627
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:04,165
back at the time
of the Punic Wars or something.

628
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,296
Well...

629
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,340
after that things went
from worse to rotten.

630
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:11,346
l mean...

631
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:12,885
it was rough.

632
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,476
What did you do?

633
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,848
lt doesn't matter.

634
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,559
What matters,

635
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,017
when you're really uP against it,

636
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,192
is to get by,

637
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:26,436
somehow.

638
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:17,426
Who are you, anyway?

639
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,847
l'm the girl from the carnival.

640
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:21,223
Oh, yes.

641
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:22,932
(Girl) Remember?

642
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:25,223
You brought me here for a Party.

643
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,954
(Woman sighs )

644
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:32,999
(GasPs )

645
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:50,433
(Gentle moaning)

646
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:34,652
(GasPing)

647
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,187
(Sighing and moaning)

648
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:16,109
(Woman cries out)

649
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:12,251
(Woman) Life from time to time
has dealt harshly with most of us.

650
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:14,168
(Man) And that kid of yours.

651
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:16,703
Pale and scared and already crazy.

652
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,051
(Woman) Science has established
the imPortance of a balanced diet

653
01:19:21,177 --> 01:19:24,131
in cases suggestive
of mental retardation

654
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:26,885
but if we don't have vitamins...

655
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:29,175
there's always fantasy.

656
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,765
God knows who his father was.

657
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:56,140
Yes.

658
01:21:14,624 --> 01:21:15,905
Who has the gun?

659
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:39,064
l wonder what haPPened to her.

660
01:21:40,942 --> 01:21:43,611
When she was 1 3
she ran away with the circus.

661
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,737
- The circus?
- Carnival.

662
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:50,150
A dinky little one-horse show.
Even the freaks weren't real.

663
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:54,235
- And God knows, there are Plenty...
- Unless... you believe in freaks.

664
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,033
That makes the difference.

665
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,661
- l wonder...
- (Man) What?

666
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:00,453
lf we went back to the carnival.

667
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:04,419
PeoPle don't stay the same
from one moment to the next.

668
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:07,716
Things change.
That's the only thing you can count on.

669
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:09,594
Like Saint Margaret.

670
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:13,255
Cast among the doubtful saints.

671
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:15,348
So where does that leave us?

672
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,597
ln the dark.

673
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:22,430
That's where we start
and that's where we finish, hm?

674
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:26,150
ln between it's just a game of...
hide and seek.

675
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:01,053
(Actress ) l must say,
l find this Picture rather crude.

676
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:04,719
(Actor) One day you'll learn that
crudity is in the eye of the beholder.

677
01:25:04,854 --> 01:25:06,812
(Actor laughs )

678
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,724
(Actor) l wonder if they're enjoying it
or if they're only Pretending,

679
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,652
faking.

680
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:16,230
(Actress ) Why would anyone let herself
be PhotograPhed like that?

681
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:19,450
(Actor) Like what?
(Actress ) One of those things.

682
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:26,959
(Actress ) The return
of Therese and lsabelle.

683
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:32,873
(Actor) Wouldn't you do those things?

684
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:35,925
(Actress ) l might
but certainly not in front of a camera.

685
01:25:36,052 --> 01:25:37,463
(Actor) Don't be too sure.

686
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,351
Don't take it so seriously.

687
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,307
lt's only a film.

688
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:51,267
(Actor) A double feature at that.

689
01:25:57,323 --> 01:25:59,482
- Like it?
- (Actress ) Not much.

690
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:01,824
lt's just like all the others.

691
01:26:01,953 --> 01:26:04,325
(Actor) No, this one's different.
You'll see.

692
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,375
l wonder where they find the girls
to make these things.

693
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:13,711
Hmm. Prostitutes, Probably.

694
01:26:31,691 --> 01:26:35,641
(Actress ) The girls in the Picture,
they're Probably just Prostitutes.

695
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:48,039
We've seen enough.

696
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:51,416
(Actor) What's the matter?
Aren't you enjoying the film?

697
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:55,163
lf you want
l could switch it onto high speed.

698
01:26:55,298 --> 01:26:58,299
l thought maybe later
we'd run it backwards.

699
01:26:58,426 --> 01:27:00,466
Have you seen
these Pictures in reverse?

700
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:02,718
Only about a thousand times.

701
01:27:02,847 --> 01:27:05,635
- Come on.
- We don't want to be late.

702
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,684
- The last time it goes on is midnight.
- Let's go.

703
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:11,018
- OK, where to?
- You'll see.

704
01:27:11,147 --> 01:27:14,848
- lt will be a surPrise.
- Oh, good. l love surPrises.

705
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:17,606
As long as they're good surPrises.

706
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:19,564
Can you guarantee it?

707
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:38,297
(Whirring)
