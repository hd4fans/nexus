00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,620
- I'm not working with this faggot again.  - Have another drink, max.

168
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,760
- Why is he here?  - We need him.

169
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,930
He'll just bitch out again. You know that.

170
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,200
Hello. I'm standing right here.

171
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,830
You're a fucking pussy.

172
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,070
Oh, are you still upset about the nose?

173
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,600
[ cup slams on bar ]

174
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,270
What the fuck is this?

175
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,240
What does it look like?

176
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,710
Looks like four-fifths of a reunion...

177
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,780
At a titty buffet...

178
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,690
In tiananmen square.

179
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,830
Well, hello back.

180
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,670
Glad to see we're all up to our usual tricks.

181
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,800
[ chuckles ]

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,070
Who's filling in for the jailbird?

183
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,610
Nobody.

184
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,810
Thought you said this was a five-man thing.  It is.

185
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,810
Jailbird flew the coop.

186
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,250
No!  It's the truth.

187
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,180
- It's only been six years.  - Good behavior.

188
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,720
That's total bullshit.

189
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,260
What'd you do?

190
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,730
Not as much as I thought I'd have to.

191
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,730
[ scoffs ]  man, you know I'm--

192
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,630
I know...

193
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,700
That you've been off the wagon for about what,

194
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,200
Five months?

195
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,640
Don't you insult me.

196
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,810
Besides, you do want to be here to celebrate...

197
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,750
Our little jailbird's return to freedom tonight, don't ya?

198
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,250
[ max ]  more.

199
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,820
You didn't say the magic word.

200
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Fuck you. Fuck the magic word.

201
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,190
Where's the fifth wheel? I want to get paid.

202
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,290
Relax. You can give him a few more minutes.

203
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,060
He just got out. You know how that goes, don't you?

204
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,800
Well, his daddy did.  [ laughs ]

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,170
[ grunting ]

206
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,100
I warned you the last time.

207
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,170
[ shouts ] max!

208
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,810
Control yourself.

209
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,790
That's all you got, huh?

210
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,320
Uh, crow.

211
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,860
What?

212
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,830
Oh, christ. Where's the bathroom?

213
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,930
[ laughing ] right over there.

214
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,930
[ whimpers ]

215
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Ain't no glory hole in there, if that's what you're looking for,

216
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,310
You fuckin' puss.

217
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,310
So... It's gonna be one of those nights.

218
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,980
You know, if we're gonna be opening up old wounds,

219
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,090
Don't you think we should have a little bit more privacy?

220
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,230
Yeah, well, we're not gonna talk about all this in front of her,

221
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,930
Are we?

222
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,960
You don't have to worry about her.

223
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,330
[ scoffs ] why?

224
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,130
Because you own her?

225
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,070
What's the matter? You don't trust my powers of persuasion?

226
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
[ inhaling deeply ]

227
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,220
Besides, we're just waiting for the party to get started.

228
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Ain't that right, fish?

229
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,060
What is this?

230
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
What is it?  [ chuckling ]

231
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,070
Your welcome back party.

232
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,840
Surprised?

233
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,270
Couldn't you have gotten me some strippers or a hooker or something?

234
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,910
[ crow ] oh, I'm sure duke could arrange that...

235
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,410
After dinner.  [ chuckles ]

236
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,350
[ crunching ]

237
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,380
Welcome back, fish.

238
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,190
Have a drink with us.

239
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,160
Do I have a choice?

240
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,300
It's wicked good to see you.

241
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
I wish I could say the same.

242
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,330
Oh, come on.

243
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,840
Let's not get off on the wrong foot, shall we?

244
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,950
Let's have a proper toast.

245
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,850
To old friends...

246
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,450
[ clink ] and fallen comrades.

247
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,230
Mmm.

248
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,170
Who's hungry?

249
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,570
Yeah. Wouldn't want it to get cold.

250
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,110
Nah, the fancy plate will keep it warm.

251
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,310
It's sushi, genius. It's served cold.

252
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,980
I know.

253
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,980
Crow.

254
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,590
How quaint.

255
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,130
Really?

256
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,120
Ah-ah-ah. Ow! What the fuck?

257
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,950
This is a special occasion.

258
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,590
Let's be civilized.

259
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,090
You want to say grace first?

260
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,890
[ sighs ]

261
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Tonight is the first night in six years...

262
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,540
That our boy fish has breathed free air.

263
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,870
I thought we might do something unique.

264
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,580
Six years, five months and 17 days,

265
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,650
If you count from the time of the arrest.

266
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,280
Ah.

267
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,020
Well, this lovely array of sushi isn't just a pretty platter.

268
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,520
No, it's dessert too. [ chuckles ]

269
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,200
Tonight we dine yakuza style.

270
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,140
The outermost portions contain your standard "plain jane" sashimi.

271
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,940
But as we move inward toward the erogenous zones,

272
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,610
The meal becomes more... Adventurous.

273
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,150
The innermost portion contains the pot of gold.

274
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,020
Fugu, as they call it, is a yakuza delicacy.

275
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,420
Fubu.

276
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,990
Fu...

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
Gu.

278
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,930
Poisonous blowfish.

279
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,370
At its best, it numbs your lips,

280
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,470
Gives you heart palpitations,

281
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,940
Makes you feel like you've touched death and lived to talk about it.

282
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,410
At its worst, well--

283
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,980
Hundreds die in japan every year from eating it.

284
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,450
It's a test of mettle in their culture.

285
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,650
We start on the outside and work our way in.

286
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,460
The closer we get to the fugu,

287
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,300
The more exotic the flavor...

288
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,030
And the more of a man you are.

289
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,400
[ chuckles ]  I'm pissin' my pants.

290
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,110
Yeah. Laying it on a little thick there, duke.

291
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,670
All of this is for me?

292
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,750
You know, maybe I should have mentioned this before, but, um...

293
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I fucking hate sushi.

294
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,390
[ francis exhales ] too bad. More for the rest of us.

295
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,130
I can't wait to eat shredded blowfish off a warm cooter.

296
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,730
Ooh, I'd buy that for a dollar.

297
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,300
[ exhales ]

298
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,700
[ chopsticks clattering ]

299
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,610
Aw, what the f-- fuckin' jap bullshit.

300
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,150
Where are the goddamn forks?

301
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,020
[ crow ]  so let me get this straight.

302
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,250
You can kill a man with your bare hands,  but you don't know how to use chopsticks.

303
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,420
Fuck with me again.

304
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,560
Gentlemen, yakuza don't bicker like this.

305
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,430
Aw, fuck the yakuza! Where's my money?

306
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,560
Max, sit.

307
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,670
Sit!

308
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,810
[ grumbles ]

309
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,550
[ duke ] let's not play the blame game tonight, okay?

310
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,290
Not before this wonderful meal that we're about to receive.

311
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,690
Everything will be evident in time.

312
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,700
I don't have 'em.

313
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,570
Eat.

314
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,240
Huh?

315
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:08,210
We got all night to talk about everything that happened...

316
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,350
Six years,

317
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,850
Five months  and 17 days ago.

318
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,520
I don't have them.

319
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,300
Look, I kept my mouth shut.

320
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,200
I did my time.

321
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,570
I just want to go home.

322
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,500
I said I'd like to enjoy this meal.

323
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,510
If this is supposed to be my last supper,  let's just cut to the fucking chase.

324
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,710
All right, fish.

325
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,650
If you insist.

326
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,620
What do you want from me?

327
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,590
There's a few loose ends that we need to tie up.

328
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,830
Loose ends?  [ crow ] yeah, you know.

329
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,560
Those little sparkly loose ends in that bag.

330
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,530
The cops took 'em.  {\i1}They're{\i0} the only loose ends.

Where's my money?

Do you really think I would try to rip you all off?

336
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,320
I just wasted the last six years of my life protecting all of you.

That's no absolution. We want what's owed us.

How do you know max didn't kill the cops and take the money for himself, huh?

Because whenever it went off, it meant my ass.

My daddy, he got it from a p.O.W. Camp outside of hiroshima.

He used to scare me to death with stories about the "savage yellow man"...

He should have been around when we dropped the bomb.

Whenever I complained, he said I had it easy.

I ain't had no gratitude 'cause I ain't seen no prison camp.

547
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,120
That's why he took me down to the mill--

548
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,560
Teach me some respect.

549
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,360
My father gave me three minutes on that timer to show some respect.

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,270
And if he didn't like...

Eventually, it didn't matter what I said or did.

He'd just set the timer back to three minutes.

Until one day, I set that timer.

00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,100
He didn't lay a finger on me after that.

558
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,340
He didn't pour no slag no more either.

[ duke ] time!

Max! I said time!

Fuck!

837
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,470
I hate this game!

00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,780


839
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,320
Oh, now your sock is all wet.

840
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,520
Bummer.

841
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,390
Well, don't have a hissy fit.

842

You know what?

847
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,320
I think...

848
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,330
It's about that time.

849
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,860
[ duke ]  uh-uh-uh, crow.

850
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,430
Remember what we said about patience?

851
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:07,400
The timer still needs to be reset.

852
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,840


853
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,940
Get ready to pay up, maxie.

854
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,850

[ sighs ]

856
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:40,300
Hi there.

857
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,470


858
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,340
My goodness.

859
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:51,480
He really did a number on you, all right. Ooh.

860
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,910
Well, I'm afraid...

861
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,890
We're gonna have to take a closer look.

862
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,990
What's the matter, francis?

863
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,330
You don't have the stomach for this anymore?

864
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,060
Did I ever?

865
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:14,300
You didn't seem to have a problem with wanton violence six years ago.

866
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,810
Things are different now, man.

867
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,840
I got a kid to support.

868

869
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:29,020
Now open up, say "ahhh!"

Oh, come on.

Hey.

872
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,960
I'll give you a lollipop when we're done, huh?

873
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,000
All right. Now look.

874
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:49,570
We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way.

875
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,640
Why'd you make us come here tonight?

876
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,840
I didn't make you do anything.

877
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,540
Why?

878
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,610

[ screaming ]

880
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,760
I thought you might want your cut.

881
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,730
You especially have been bitching about needing money.

882
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,900
Since when do you ever pony up for charity?

883
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,470
This is hardly charity.

884
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,140
[ screaming ]

885
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,840

Attaboy.

I know what you're doing.

889
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,060
Is that so?

890
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,470
Is that what you told your friends outside?

891
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,530

896
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,980
What did you say?

897
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,650

Just as I feared.

901
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,490
Mr. Tooth decay is on the March.

902
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,590
We're gonna have to remove another.

903
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,600
Where the hell you goin'?

904
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,630
The fucking bathroom.

You know, the lack of dental hygiene...

916
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,290
In state prisons is a real travesty.

I think I spied some more cavities in there.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Now, we've played this little game before, fish.

You remember what happens when you lie?

So, talk.

You're smart, crow. Do the math.

He paid off those cops to retrieve the loot and pin it on fish.

Same cops max got rid of.

Six years later,  fish gets out of jail, and we all end up dead.

He walks with our money, no questions asked.

Hmm. I guess this is the point where the police storm the building, right?

Why don't you just go ahead and unbutton your shirt.

You're even worse than crow.

1046
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,180
At least duke talks to him like he's a real person.

You're nothing but a dog.

你满意了吧？

哦，克洛

怎么了？

1486

哦，天哪，洗手间在哪里呢？

那边不就是你要的去DIY的地方

去你的

1491
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,310
所以。。。今晚又是一个揭伤疤的时候

1492
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,980
你知道，如果我们去揭开旧伤疤

1493
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,090
你不觉得我们需要一点隐私吗？

1494
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,230
是啊，我们不要在那个女人面前谈论一切

1495
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,930
是吗？

1496
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,960
你完全不必担心她

1497
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,330
[ 冷笑 ] 为什么?

1498
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,130
因为她是你的吗？

1499
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,070
有什么关系?你不相信我的威慑力吗?

1500
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
[ 深呼吸 ]

1501

而且，派队马上就要开始

1502
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,220
对吗，费什?

1503
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,060
怎么回事?

1504
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
这是什么?  [ 笑声 ]

1505
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,070
你的出狱接风派对

1506
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,840
惊喜吗？

1507
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,270
你就不能直接送我个陪酒女郎或者舞女嘛？

1508
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,910
[克洛] 哦，我确定杜克可能在晚餐后

1509
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,410
已经安排了这些  [ 笑声 ]

欢迎回来，费什

1513

我有的选嘛？

1514
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,300
见到你太高兴了!

1515
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
我也希望我能说一样的

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,330
哦，拜托阿

1517
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,840
我们别搞砸气氛了

1518
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,950
来一个正式一点的祝酒词

1519
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,850
为了友谊

1520
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,450
[ 碰酒杯声 ] 和一群堕落的兄弟们

1521
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,230
恩

1522
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,170
有人饿了吗？

1523
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,570
是啊，再等的话，它们都凉了

1524
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,110
不会，这个高级的盘子有神奇的保温功能

1525
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,310
这可是寿司阿，本来不就应该是凉的

1526
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,980
我知道

1527

克洛

1528
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,590
太怪了

1529
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,130
不会吧?

1530
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,120
阿欧，搞什么了?

1531
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,950
在这么一个特殊的场合

1532
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,590
文明一点

1533
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,090
你要开了正式的开场白嘛?

1534
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,890
[ 叹息声 ]

1535
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,600
我想这是六年来第一次

1536
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,540
我们的兄弟费什可以呼吸到自由的空气

1537
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,870
我觉得我们可以做些特别的事情

1538
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,580
六年，五个月，十七天

1539
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,650
如果你从我们被捕那天开始算

1540
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,280
啊。

1541
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,020
好吧，排列有序的寿司可不仅仅是份漂亮的大餐

1542
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,520
是啊，也是甜点 [ 笑声 ]

1543
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,200
今晚我们用yakuza(日本黑帮)方式吃饭

1544
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,140
最外围的部分是寻常的的生鱼片

1545
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,940
但是，当我们慢慢移向"敏感地带"

1546
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,610
美食就变得更加像...“探险”

1547
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,150
最里面的部分就是所谓的“金矿”

1548
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,020
他们称之为，Fugu(河豚肉)- yakuza的精髓所在

1549
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,420
河部

1550
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,990
河...

1551
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
豚.

1552
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,930
有毒的河豚

1553
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,370
其中最好的一种河豚，它会麻痹你的嘴唇，

1554
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,470
使你的心跳加速

1555
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,940
让你如同触碰到死亡，又起死回生，来叙述感受

1556
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,410
但是最坏的情形，也就是--

1557
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,980
在日本，几百号人吃了它而丧生

1558
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,450
在他们的文化中，这是一种属于勇者的游戏

1559
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,650
我们从外围开始，然后慢慢往中间推进

1560
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,460
越接近河豚

1561
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,300
就越有异国情调

1562
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,030
也越能证明你个真男人

1563

这些都是给我准备的嘛?

1566
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,750
你知道，我应该早点告诉你的..

1567
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
我最讨厌的就是寿司

1568

[ 弗朗西斯吹气 ] 太惨了，那我们得吃得更多了

[ 克洛 ]  那我恕我直说

1576

你可以赤手空拳杀人，但是你不懂用筷子

1577

你还想死一次嘛？

起码不在这顿即将入口的美食之前

1585
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,690
一切问题都会得会迎刃而接

我说过我想好好吃这一顿

你真的觉得我会背叛你们所有人吗？

我只不过浪费我生命中的六年时间来保护你们所有人

这个不是你能开脱的借口，我们要我们应得的。

我只想要回我的六年，虽然这是不可能的

就好像你们拿不回你们该死的钻石一样

省省你的血泪史，告诉我们真相吧

嘿，在里面吸毒的家伙，我要用厕所

1649
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,500
他已经呆在里面20分钟了  冷静

1650

[ 敲门声 ]

1651
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,310
嘿，你死在里面了嘛?

1652
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,610
你都等了这么久了，再等几分又怎么样？

1653
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,980
我早上喝了半瓶泻药，混球，你倒来试试看?

1654
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,790
[  笑 ] 你有必要这样做呢？

1655
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,390
我会在工作前把胃清空  [ 胃咕噜声 ]

1656
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,660
- 什么意思?  - 就是--

1658

- 你听过维尼.帕克嘛？  - 谁是维尼.帕克?

1659
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,030
我倒，又要来这个了

1660
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,740
我的天，如果每次听到这个故事我能赚一块钱就好了

1661
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,440
我听了无数遍了

1662
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,740
好吧--

1663
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
很久以前

1664
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,380
有个家伙叫维尼.帕克

1665
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,610
他是城里最好的赛车手

1666
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,750
他是天生的摩托党，懂吗？

1667
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,480
我意思是，为了飙车而疯狂的家伙

1668
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,360
如果他有机会，会成为不带头盔的马里奥·安德烈蒂（意大利著名车手）

1669
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,460
[ 胃咕噜声 ] 所以

1670
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,490
[ 呼气声 ] 好多年前，他和

1671
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,490
一对叫蒙西的双胞胎，还有一些拖后腿的家伙，

1672
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,600
开着他的Brinks的车，一起去打劫银行

1673
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,530
但是抢劫进行得不太顺利

1674
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,770
过程中几个劫匪还中枪了，具体细节我也不清楚

1675
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,040
但是多亏有维尼.帕克，他们还是抢到了大约200万现金

1676
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,570
是啊

1677
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,010
还没逃掉10分钟，

1678
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,380
多纳蒙西（双胞胎之一），跟白痴一样的人

1679
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,420
他，他居然往窗外跟路边的警察

1680
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,550
对视了一下

1681
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,550
警察马上认出了他，然后后面你知道了

1682
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,790
肯定是要倒大霉了，整个城的警察都在追他们

1683
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,090
[ 肚子声，咕噜]

1684
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,860
哦，开什么玩笑。

1685
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,630
但是不论如何，维尼帕克带着他们经历了疯狂地五个小时的逃逸

1686
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,500
直到在圣费尔南多的一个高速上，油已经耗尽了

1687
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,940
他跳出车，跟警察开始交火了

1688
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,040
当然，他们肯定不想被抓回去

1689
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,740
总之到最后，维尼.帕克最后脸上中了两弹死了

1690
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,450
他肠子里的东西被全被曝光在电视屏幕前

1691
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,450
你觉得很好笑吗？小家伙？  [ 笑声 ]

1692
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,060
你听我说，他可是憋了一整天的大便!

1693
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,060
他以为搞定抢劫后就能拉了，但是他不是错了嘛？

1694
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,860
居然还有直升飞机在拍摄当时的画面

1695
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,760
6点的新闻播放出来了

1696
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,500
可怜的维尼，躺在那死了--

1697
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,170
血一滩，还屎尿一地

1698

[ 笑声 ]  我只是--

1700
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,040
我真没想到这个事情还会这样

1701
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,510
但是他的老妈也看见了这一切

1702
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,150
完完整整

1703
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,590
我说，我不太知道你怎么想

1704
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,560
但是如果我在工作中死了

1705
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,930
我起码要讨回一点起码的尊严，好吗？

1706
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,030
快点给我出来！

嘿，这些可是经典“能剧”（日本歌剧）里的面具

1712

是啊，就是“不”(不和能剧同音)  我才不戴这些同性恋面具

1713
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,920
我们不能戴曲棍球或者滑雪面具嘛？

为什么?

1725
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,920

00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,160
你的故事跟这个计时器有什么联系?

1805
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,060
我马上讲到那个了

1806
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,030
不要浪费我的时间

1807
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,610
珍惜你说话的机会

1808
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,090
我和我的计时器可是很有故事的

1809
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,030
当你在宾夕法尼亚州的一个煤渣洞里，为生存所做的一切，

1810
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,000
就是捣岩浆

1811
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,030
我养成了一些很不好的习惯

1812
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,540
我曾经很害怕计时器

1813
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,050
时间一到，意味着我的屁屁要倒霉了

1814
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,990
我爸爸，他从广岛的一个战俘营里得到

1815
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,700
他曾经用它编了一个“野蛮的黄种人”的故事来吓唬我

1816
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,730
在监狱里，他们残酷地鞭打他

1817
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,500
[ 笑声 ]

1818
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,740
当美国向广岛扔原子弹的时候，我觉得他肯定就在附近

1819
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,480
他总是让我不要抱怨太多，这些都是小菜一碟

1820
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,680
我没有经历他那段监狱生活，我根本不懂

1821
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,120
这就是为什么他把我带下这个地狱

1822
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,560
教我学会尊重

1823
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,360
我爸爸给我三分钟，定在这个钟上，显示了对我的尊重

1824
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,270
但是如果

1825
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,270
他不喜欢我在这个三分钟里面给的解释，那当这个“叮”响起的时候

1826
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,110
[ 叹息声 ]

1827
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,280
我已经尽力做到最好，免受皮肉之苦了

1828
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,690
但是到了后面，不管我说什么，或者做什么

1829
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,630
他只是重新设三分钟

1830
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,260
直到有一天，轮到我来设三分钟

1831
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,100
他之后再也没有动过我

1832
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,340
他也没有再工作

1833
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,740
我呆在那里，看着他化掉的身体

1834
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,410
从炼钢的岩浆里喷出来

1835
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,820
然后我就走了

1836
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,470
[ 喘气声 ]

1837
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,110
我一定要发现到底这玩意从哪里来的

1838
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,610
我想要了解文化背景

1839
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,420
是什么可以激发我老爸

1840
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,620
这么多的仇恨

1841
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,760
我必须回到原点

1842
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,230
你知道我找到了什么？

1843
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,700
嗯？

1844
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,410
我只是跟他们一样

1845
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,480
或者这个钟

1846
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,850
是我第一个战利品

1847
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,800
我现在就要给你设一个

1848
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,900
如果你不吐出那些钻石的话

1849
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,510


1850
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,780
[ 滴答声 ]

1851
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
[ 叮 ]

1852
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,250
你现在还有三分钟

1853
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,530
[ 滴答声 ]

1854
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,600
好吧

1855
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,670
谁先来？

1856
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,640
我来

1857
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,270
不行

1858
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,710
我先来

1859
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,540
我先说得

1860
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,940
你说了吗？

1861
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,510
我去

1862
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,850
我才不怕你呢

1863
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
还没到时候

1864
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,590
混蛋

1865
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,590
麦克斯，你的肌肉是很牛逼

1866
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,660
但是对找回我们的钱没有用

1867
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,260
- 真的有必要这样吗？  - 你还要不要你那一份？

1868
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,440
是，但是拜托，他是自己人。

1869
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,310
“自己人”？

1870
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,780
你真的跟他很熟嘛？

1871
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,250
但是如果他真的什么都不知道呢?

1872
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,750
-你在说什么呢？  - [ 嘲笑声 ]

1873
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,680
如果那个位子上的人换做是你，会怎么样？

1874
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,390
[ 笑声 ] 嘿，如果是我，我可不会在这里

1875
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,460
[ 拍案而起 ]

1876
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
哦，好吧，随便吧。

1877
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,600
算你的了，大块头！

1878
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,370
你这样拿不到钱的

1879
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,770
不行吗？

1880
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,370
不可能的

1881
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,610
[ 笑声 ]

1882
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,380
继续说。

1883
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,450
不不不，我们不要太性急了

1884
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,520
给他一点时间吧

1885
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,580
遵守规则

1886
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,920
你可是拷问过那批警察的

1887
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,930
他们怎么说的？

1888
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,030
好吧，他们怎么说得不重要

1889
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,900
那些肮脏的警察太不可信了，你可信吗？

1890

[ 笑声 ]

1891
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,870
而且，如果他们真的有那家伙，我早就接管了

1892
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,640
随你怎么折磨我，但是对你得到你那份没有任何帮助

1893
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,480
[ 叹息声 ] 也许吧

1894
