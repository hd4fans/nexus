1
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,151
如果你想买票
If you want any tickets,

2
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:50,945
你应该走前面...
you'll have to go round to the front of...

3
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,701
哦，我想这样也可以
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

4
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,908
我是在这儿干什么呀？
What the hell am I doing around here?

5
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,960
他们走进来还要...
They walk in here and...

6
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:06,040
让我看看，我希望我有...
Let's see. I hope I got...

7
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:08,133
三张？
Three?

8
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,444
七美元...
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:33,036
...五十分
..and 50 cents.

10
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,913
别
No.

11
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,792
弗兰克？
Frank?

12
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:39,637
弗兰克叫我们来
Frank sent us.

13
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:46,139
你们给我带马来了吗？
Did you bring a horse for me?

14
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,729
好啊，看起来我们...
Well, looks like we're...

15
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,401
看起来我们不好意思只带一匹来
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

16
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,572
你带两匹来太多了
You brought two too many.

17
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,861
爸！
Pa!

18
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:49,989
看！
Look!

19
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:16,179
够了，时候不早了 回家去
That's enough for now. It's getting late. Come on home.

20
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,163
提米
Timmy.

21
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,589
穆琳，看哪
Maureen, look.

22
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,383
你在这里干嘛？
What you doing there?

23
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:08,467
进屋去，快，去洗一下
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,168
不要碰苹果派和烤肉
And don't touch the apple pie or the roast.

25
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:14,841
帕特里克已经出发去火车站了
Patrick's already left for the station.

26
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,720
他刚刚准备好，爸
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,142
- 快点，帕特里克！ - 来了，爸
- Damn it, Patrick! - Coming, Pa.

28
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,776
不得不说，还不错
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,815
大些，那些片。怎么回事？ 我们是在准备宴会，不是吗？
Bigger, them slices. What the hell? We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,480
但是这些和以前的一样
But these are the same slices as usual.

31
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,150
是的，当然
Yeah, sure.

32
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,947
和以前一样
As usual.

33
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,955
穆琳
Maureen.

34
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:54,959
过不了不久，如果你愿意 你可以把面包切的和门一样大
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,584
你会有漂亮的新衣服
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,388
再也不用干活了
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,969
我们要变富了吗，爸？
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,638
天知道？
Who knows?

39
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,023
帕特里克！
Patrick!

40
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,228
等一等！
Wait a minute!

41
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,990
看看你靴子上的脏东西，去弄干净
Look at the filth on your boots. Clean 'em.

42
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,870
火车就要到了，不想没有人接你妈吧
The train'll come in and there won't be no one to meet your mother.

43
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,912
我妈六年前就死了
Our mother died six years ago.

44
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,464
快走，否则你真的要迟了
Go now, or you'll really be late.

45
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,771
嗨，等一下，爸 我怎么认出来她
Just a minute. Listen, Pa. How will I recognise her?

46
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,022
你绝不会认错的，帕特里克
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

47
00:19:55,151 --> 00:20:01,071
她年轻漂亮，并且是位女士
She's young and she's pretty and she's a lady.

48
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,112
“旅行中，我会穿一件黑衣服
"For travelling, I'll be wearing a black dress

49
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:14,625
头戴认识你时的那顶帽子。”
and the same straw hat that I was wearing when we met."

50
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,468
我去井里打点水来
I'm gonna get some fresh water from the well.

51
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:33,646
噢，丹尼男孩 [爱尔兰民歌：丹尼男孩]
Oh, Danny boy

52
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:37,901
笛声正在呼唤
The pipes, the pipes are calling

53
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,239
越过峡谷下到山腰
And down the mountain side

54
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,027
夏日已经过去
The summer's gone

55
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,576
花儿都已凋谢...
And all the roses fall...

56
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:47,904
穆琳！
Maureen!

57
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,108
这一个怎么办，弗兰克？
What are we gonna do with this one, Frank?

58
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:17,211
现在你都已经叫出我的名字了...
Now that you've called me by name...

59
00:25:57,396 --> 00:26:00,765
- 在南面我看到一些优质原料 - 是吗？
- I saw some fine stock down south. - That so?

60
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,358
价格也很公道
And the prices are good.

61
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,362
- 这些是你的行李吗，女士？ - 是的
- These your valises, ma'am? - Yes.

62
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:18,621
- 过来，莎拉 - 拿另外两个
- Come, Sarah. - Bring them other two.

63
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,577
我们帮你背，女士
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

64
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,938
真的吗？ 锯木厂真的需要帮手？
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?

65
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,904
- 昨天还找人去 - 为什么不告诉你兄弟？
- Was yesterday. - Why didn't you tell your brother?

66
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,603
- 嗨，老爷子 - 嗨，比尔，我们又回来了
- Hiya, Gramps. - Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

67
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,698
来吧，还不快点，你？
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

68
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:58,287
快去找你们的头儿 你们这些红皮肤的战士们
Get the lead out of your asses, you redskin warriors.

69
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:00,704
我还有一整车的货要卸
I got a whole train to unload.

70
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,871
好了 先把那些饲料袋扔下来
Alright, chuck down those feed sacks first.

71
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,376
快点！
Come on!

72
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,218
你要去什么地方？
What's the name of the place you wanted to go?

73
00:29:57,344 --> 00:29:58,720
甜水镇
Sweetwater.

74
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,675
布赖特.马克贝恩的农场
Brett McBain's farm.

75
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,515
马克贝恩？噢，是吗
McBain? Yeah, sure.

76
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,971
那个顽固的红头发爱尔兰人
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

77
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:13,690
在荒无人烟的沙漠中央耕种沙子
tilling sand for years out in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,986
甜水！只有他那样的疯子
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

79
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,981
才把那块地上不长毛的沙漠叫作甜水
could call that stinking piece of desert Sweetwater.

80
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:22,945
甜水！
Sweetwater!

81
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:15,917
往右边来一点
A little more to the right.

82
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,337
高一点
Higher.

83
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,005
那儿正好
Hold it there.

84
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:33,646
这些家伙 把铁路铺到这里来了
Here they are. Even got here with their damn rails.

85
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:37,772
他们又赶上我们了 架，拉斐德？我们走！
They caught up with us again, eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

86
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,525
慢一点 你怎么搞的？
Slow down. What's the matter with you?

87
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,110
那边的闪一闪！
Watch out down there!

88
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,275
慢一点！
Slow down!

89
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:55,642
为什么停下？ 我说过我很着急
Why are we stopping? I told you I was in a hurry.

90
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,015
火车不是也要停吗？
Don't the train stop?

91
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:47,549
能为您做点什么，女士？
What can I do for you, ma'am?

92
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:50,381
如果不介意的话 我想要点水
I would like some water, if it's no trouble.

93
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:55,091
水？在这里那个词好比毒药
Water? That word is poison around these parts

94
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,432
自从那场大洪水后
ever since the days of the great flood.

95
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,645
- 你是说你们从来不洗澡？ - 当然我们洗！
- You mean you never wash? - We sure do!

96
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,727
我愿意用你们用的相同的东西
I'd like to use the same facilities you people do.

97
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:07,228
当然你可以 后面正好有一个装满的浴缸
You sure can. Just happen to have a full tub at the back.

98
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:11,443
你很幸运 今天早上才有三个人用过
You're lucky. Only three people have used it this morning.

99
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:14,280
一个一个用的还是一起？
Used it one at a time or all together?

100
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:22,450
我敢说你过惯了舒适的生活
I can tell you're accustomed to fine living.

101
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:25,753
你一定是从东部某个大城市来的吧
Bet you come from one of those big eastern cities.

102
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,455
- 新奥尔良 - 新奥尔良！
- New Orleans. - New Orleans!

103
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,501
- 你去过？ - 没
- You've been there? - No.

104
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:33,174
但是我有个表姊在那儿 她开了个酒吧
But I got a cousin down there. She runs a bar.

105
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,547
知道么，她...
You know, she...

106
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,699
一整瓶
Jug.

107
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:27,915
你只知道怎么演奏 还是知道怎么开枪？
Do you only know how to play or do you know how to shoot?

108
00:39:31,718 --> 00:39:34,672
知道怎么用那个吹曲子吗？
Do you know how to blow music from that?

109
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:56,773
捡起来
Pick it up.

110
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,179
你！
You!

111
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,645
你不会玩
You don't know how to play.

112
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,631
试试这个
Try this one.

113
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:16,151
拿着
Take it.

114
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:37,424
快点
Go on.

115
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,563
这儿
Here.

116
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:31,803
做得好
Bravo.

117
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:59,334
夏恩 还以为我们赶不及呢
Cheyenne. We thought we'd never make it.

118
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,338
还行，你们很准时
It's alright. You're right on time.

119
00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:07,181
把那个护卫埋了
To bury my escort.

120
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,178
如果等你 我现在已经在监狱里了
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

121
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,126
我的枪
The gun.

122
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:05,231
你很赶时髦，口琴家？
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

123
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,750
不久之前我看到三件这样的外套
I saw three of these dusters a short time ago.

124
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:16,999
在等一列火车
They were waiting for a train.

125
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:25,509
三个穿这种外套的家伙
Inside the dusters, there were three men.

126
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,176
然后呢？
So?

127
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:33,346
每个人身体里都有一颗子弹
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

128
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,359
骗人的故事，口琴家
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

129
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:52,571
两个原因
For two reasons.

130
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:55,327
第一个，这里没有人
One, nobody around these parts

131
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,828
敢穿这种外套 除了夏恩的人
got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's, man.

132
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,923
第二个，夏恩的人 不会被杀
Two, Cheyenne's, man, don't get killed.

133
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:10,214
你吃惊了吗？
That surprise you?

134
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,140
是的
Yeah.

135
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:18,477
哦，你懂音乐
Well, you know music.

136
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:22,770
还能把所有的东西数到二
And you can count. All the way up to two.

137
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:33,113
数到六，如果我必须
All the way up to six, if I have to.

138
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:36,990
也许要比你快
And maybe faster than you.

139
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,466
好，继续
Yeah, go on.

140
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,806
吹吧，口琴家
Play, Harmonica.

141
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,770
吹吧，就不会胡言乱语了
Play, so you can't bullshit.

142
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:01,856
但是，小心那些错误的注解
Only, watch those false notes.

143
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:11,611
比如？
Like so?

144
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:29,958
我的这个表姊总是写信邀请我去新奥尔良
This cousin of mine keeps writing me to come down to New Orleans.

145
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:33,844
“过来吧，帮我照料酒吧，多挣点钱”
"Come on down. Help me with the bar. Make a pile of money."

146
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,809
我想我适应不了大城市的生活
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

147
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:39,343
到处是放荡的男人和女人
It's too full of fast men and loose women.

148
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:42,053
对不起，女士。不
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

149
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:47,359
现在我习惯了安静简单的乡下生活
Now, I'm too used to a quiet simple country life.

150
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,638
他是提米
He's Timmy.

151
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:22,763
是的
Yes.

152
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,969
天哪
Dear God.

153
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,306
那天...
On the day...

154
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:32,644
在你婚礼的那天
On the very day of your wedding.

155
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,860
可怜的小姐
Poor little miss.

156
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,816
夫人
Mrs.

157
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:41,778
马克贝恩夫人
Mrs McBain.

158
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,913
但是我们都...我们以为...
But we all... We thought...

159
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:47,285
我知道
I know.

160
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:51,545
今天你们一定很吃惊
It was to be a surprise today.

161
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:54,044
布赖特.马克贝恩和我结了婚
Brett McBain and I were married.

162
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,333
一个月之前
A month ago.

163
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:59,303
在新奥尔良
In New Orleans.

164
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,562
复活在我，生命也在我
I am the resurrection and the life.

165
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:21,280
信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活
He who believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.

166
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,704
凡活着信我的人，必永远不死。阿门
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Amen.

167
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:44,634
- 贝奈特先生！ - 他在这里做什么？
- Mr Bennett! - What's he doing here?

168
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,645
我发现这个衣领，钉在门上
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

169
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:58,949
你没办法知道 但这是个最好的签名
You got no way of knowing, but this is as good as a signature.

170
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,120
夏恩的手下
Cheyenne's hand.

171
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:06,332
- 但是为什么？ - 别着急，马克贝恩女士
- But why? - Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

172
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,954
在绞死他们之前，我们会让他们说的
We'll make 'em tell us before we hang 'em.

173
00:51:10,508 --> 00:51:12,382
我们走吧
Let's get moving.

174
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,866
走吧 我们回石板镇吧
Come on. Let's go back to Flagstone.

175
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:40,825
不，山姆
No, Sam.

176
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:44,455
你回去吧
You go back.

177
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:48,119
你不会想一个人留在这里吧
You don't want to stay out here alone.

178
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:50,631
为什么不呢？
Why not?

179
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,584
这是我的家
This is my home.

180
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:53,367
知道吗，无赖...
You know, Wobbles,...

181
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,040
...你让我发火了
..I'm kinda mad at you.

182
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,297
弗兰克不在那儿
Frank wasn't there.

183
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:07,216
他叫了三个朋友去
He sent three friends.

184
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:10,016
我什么都不知道，我发誓
I don't know nothing, I swear.

185
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:14,685
我只是按你的意思安排了那个会面
I only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it.

186
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:18,146
我不知道为什么弗兰克没去
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

187
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:21,893
- 我对你发誓我... - 因为他在马克贝恩家
- I swear to you that l... - Cos he was at the McBains'.

188
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,399
不是他 那是夏恩做的
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

189
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:28,319
每个人都知道，我们有证据
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

190
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:32,615
那不过是弗兰克玩的把戏，捏造证据
That was always one of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

191
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:37,667
我不知道，我发誓
I don't know. I swear.

192
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:42,123
我只是安排了会面，我发誓
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

193
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:44,712
我什么都不知道
I don't know nothing.

194
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:46,997
谁在那儿？
Who's there?

195
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:20,695
你会做咖啡吗？
Did you make coffee?

196
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:26,414
去做
Make it.

197
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,297
一晚上没合眼
Didn't sleep a wink.

198
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:40,803
一群黑衣服的卑鄙小人追了我整整一夜
A pack of turds dressed in black rode herd on me the whole damn night.

199
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,016
是的，不过我把他们甩到沙漠里了
Yeah, but I left them in the middle of the desert.

200
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:50,561
幸运的话，他们三天后会回来
If they're lucky, they'll be home in three days.

201
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:12,285
我做这个。你去拿咖啡
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

202
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:22,879
他们想绞死我 那些黑乌鸦
They want to hang me, the big black crows.

203
01:02:24,432 --> 01:02:26,390
白痴
Idiots.

204
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:28,309
为什么？
What the hell?

205
01:02:28,436 --> 01:02:31,390
我会杀任何人，但是决不包括孩子
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

206
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:34,729
可以去杀神父
Be like killing a priest.

207
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,267
一个天主教的神父，仅此而已
A Catholic priest, that is.

208
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:41,363
是啊，这个世界上有很多人痛恨夏恩
Yeah, the world is full of people who hate Cheyenne.

209
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,551
看，我并不是人们所说的那种混蛋
See, I ain't the mean bastard people make out.

210
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:09,346
当然，如果有人想杀我...
Of course, if somebody had a mind to kill me,...

211
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,806
...激怒我
..it fires me up.

212
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,438
被激怒了的夏恩...
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

213
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,609
...可不是好惹的
..ain't a nice thing to see.

214
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:24,899
特别是对于一个女士
Especially for a lady.

215
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,840
但是你很聪明不会去激怒他
But you're too smart to make him mad.

216
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:49,725
这就是那个说我杀了所有人的地方吗？
So this here's where I was supposed to do all the killing?

217
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,267
哼
Yeah.

218
01:03:54,272 --> 01:03:57,059
没看出来哪里值得
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

219
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:07,776
那么，如果有人打扮得像我一样...
Now, if somebody gets dressed up to look like me,...

220
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,368
...他们就可以把这事扯在我头上...
..so they can hang this thing around my neck,...

221
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:17,625
...我一点也不喜欢这样
..I don't like it none.

222
01:04:18,797 --> 01:04:20,920
但是可以理解
But I can understand it.

223
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:30,098
我不明白的是为了什么
What I don't understand is why.

224
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:32,802
我也不明白
Neither do l.

225
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:40,892
但是我觉得你知道的很多
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

226
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,731
没错
Yeah.

227
01:04:51,913 --> 01:04:55,614
如果有一整堆问题呢？
What if there were a whole heap of whys?

228
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,994
圆的，黄的（形容各种豆子）
Round. Yellow.

229
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,671
你知道的
You know the kind.

230
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:05,875
你把他们扔到石头上...
You rap 'em on a stone,...

231
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:09,467
...他们噼啪作响
..and they go "ding".

232
01:05:09,598 --> 01:05:10,760
也许
Maybe.

233
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,516
但是我还没有找到他们
But I didn't find them.

234
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:23,275
顺便问一下
By the way,

235
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:28,314
你知不知道一个到处吹口琴的家伙
you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica?

236
01:05:30,452 --> 01:05:33,157
你应该记住他
He's somebody you'd remember.

237
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,827
他不说话而吹口琴
Instead of talking, he plays.

238
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,502
当他应该吹的时候，他却说话
And when he'd better play, he talks.

239
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:48,417
你明白，如果你已经杀了四个 很容易再有第五个
You know, when you've killed four, it's easy to make it five.

240
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,351
确实如此，你是个行家
Sure. You're an expert.

241
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,977
夫人，看起来你没有理解我的意思
Ma'am, it seems to me you ain't caught the idea.

242
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:10,823
我当然明白
Of course I have.

243
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:14,779
我孤零零一个人 落在一伙见钱眼开的强盗手里
I'm here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money.

244
01:06:14,913 --> 01:06:18,578
如果你愿意，你可以凌辱我寻开心
If you want to, you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself.

245
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,500
甚或叫你的人进来
And even call in your men.

246
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:23,379
没关系，没有女人因为那样而死
Well, no woman ever died from that.

247
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:27,585
你完事后，我需要的仅仅是一盆开水
When you're finished, all I'll need will be a tub of boiling water,

248
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,959
然后我会和以前完全一样
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

249
01:06:30,095 --> 01:06:33,677
不过是又多了一个肮脏的回忆而已
With just another filthy memory.

250
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:52,737
你的咖啡还不错
You make good coffee, at least.

251
01:06:53,368 --> 01:06:54,862
不错
Not bad.

252
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:57,153
恭喜你
Congratulations.

253
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:01,333
告诉我，有没有必要把他们全部杀掉？
Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?

254
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:04,496
我只是告诉你吓吓他们
I only told you to scare them.

255
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:07,630
当他们死亡的时候是最恐惧的时候
People scare better when they're dying.

256
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,672
你能说说你的屠杀有什么好处吗？
And can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre?

257
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,550
现在，出来了一个马克贝恩夫人
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

258
01:07:17,976 --> 01:07:21,179
我没有料到那个 是个意外
So, I didn't expect that. It happens in business.

259
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:24,764
这么说吧这是我们没有计划到的
Let's say this is something I didn't plan on.

260
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:28,812
我没有时间去吃惊了，弗兰克
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

261
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:32,610
你知道
You know that.

262
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:36,785
我要上船去看一看大西洋
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

263
01:07:36,912 --> 01:07:40,115
在我的眼睛瞎掉之前
and before my eyes rot,

264
01:07:40,248 --> 01:07:45,753
我想看看窗外蓝色的大西洋
I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.

265
01:07:45,879 --> 01:07:48,286
我知道你在哪里上火车的
I know where you got on board.

266
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:50,831
别忘了，我也在那里
I was there, too, remember.

267
01:07:55,764 --> 01:08:02,134
清除掉道路上的障碍，你说过
To remove small obstacles from the track, you said.

268
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:04,683
哦，还有一些
Well, there were a few.

269
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:12,279
但是我们走了很远 还是一样
But we travelled a long way, just the same.

270
01:08:12,405 --> 01:08:13,983
而且很快
And fast.

271
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:17,983
骨头上的结核也走得很快
Even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast.

272
01:08:19,746 --> 01:08:23,660
别把我当病人，莫顿先生
Don't play the sick man with me, Mr Morton.

273
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:27,077
你刚刚开始腿瘸我就认识你了
I knew you when you were just barely limping.

274
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:33,961
我看着你那枯掉的肢体一天天吞噬你
I watch that dry rot rise a little more every day.

275
01:08:36,388 --> 01:08:38,879
任何一个正常人都会给自己来颗子弹的
Any normal man'd put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:43,060
然而你，只是变得稍微有些急躁
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:08:43,937 --> 01:08:46,262
别的你一点都没变
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:08:46,398 --> 01:08:48,853
你变了，弗兰克
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:08:48,984 --> 01:08:50,478
很多
A lot.

280
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:55,313
你过去总是亲自去做事情
You used to take care of certain things personally.

281
01:08:56,908 --> 01:09:00,573
现在，你要隐藏在幕后
Now, you're keeping in the background.

282
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:04,201
你会最终发号施令
You'll end up giving orders.

283
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:09,410
因为，目前，我不想让你总是一个人
It's because, now, I don't want to leave you alone too much.

284
01:09:11,923 --> 01:09:16,170
你需要越来越多的人和你在一起
You're gonna need somebody more and more every day to stay near you.

285
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,972
- 朋友 - 或是同伙
- Like a friend. - Or like a partner.

286
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:33,184
感觉如何 坐在那个桌子后面，弗兰克？
How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?

287
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,861
就像握着一把枪
It's almost like holding a gun.

288
01:09:43,496 --> 01:09:46,414
不过更有威力些
Only much more powerful.

289
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:05,927
你看，和你在一起，我...
You see, staying with you, l...

290
01:10:07,354 --> 01:10:10,390
...我也变得目光远大了
..I'm beginning to think big, too.

291
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:15,897
这次马克贝恩事件...
This McBain business...

292
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,481
...给了我一个想法
..has given me ideas.

293
01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:28,410
什么意思，弗兰克
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

294
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,783
你做的很好
You're doing your best.

295
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:34,161
但是你永远无法取得像我一样的成功
You'll never succeed in becoming like me.

296
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:38,206
为什么？
Why?

297
01:10:38,343 --> 01:10:43,966
因为有很多事情你永远都不会不明白
Because there are many things you'll never understand.

298
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:57,690
这就是其中之一
This is one of them.

299
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,439
看，弗兰克，有很多种武器
You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons.

300
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:06,616
唯一能平息这场风波的是它
And the only one that can stop that is this.

301
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:03,633
现在应该回到我们的小麻烦上了吧？
Now, shall we get back to our little problem?

302
01:12:05,847 --> 01:12:09,097
也许你认为我的武器很简单，莫顿先生
My weapons might look simple to you, Mr Morton,

303
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:14,267
但它仍旧可以在我们的小麻烦上打个窟窿
but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.

304
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:19,271
过不了多久 那个马克贝恩寡妇就不会再是个麻烦了
Pretty soon the widow McBain won't be a problem no more.

305
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:24,864
清晨，你醒来说 “世界，我了解你”
You wake up one morning and say, "World, I know you."

306
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:27,696
“从现在开始，不再有惊奇”
"From now on, there are no more surprises."

307
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:30,365
然后你偶尔碰倒了一个这样的男人
And then you happen to meet a man like this,

308
01:12:30,497 --> 01:12:32,324
看起来像是一个好男人
who looked like a good man.

309
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:35,209
清澈的目光，强壮的臂膀
Clear eyes, strong hands.

310
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:37,244
他想娶你
And he wants to marry you.

311
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:39,537
这种事不常发生
Which doesn't happen often.

312
01:12:39,673 --> 01:12:42,709
他说他还很富有，那并不重要
And he says he's rich, too, which doesn't hurt.

313
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:49,173
所以你想 “见鬼去吧，新奥尔良”
So you think, "The hell with New Orleans."

314
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:52,344
“现在我要说愿意还要去乡下生活”
"Now I'll say yes and go live in the country."

315
01:12:54,312 --> 01:12:58,227
“我不介意给她生一群孩子”
"l wouldn't mind giving him half a dozen kids after all."

316
01:12:59,025 --> 01:13:03,734
“照料房子，随便做些事情”
"Take care of a house. Do something. What the hell?"

317
01:13:14,499 --> 01:13:17,666
唔，愿主使你的灵魂安息吧，布赖特.马克贝恩
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

318
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:22,752
就算他需要去使你脱离恶魔的控制
Even if he's going to have a job pulling you out of the devil's grip.

319
01:13:37,355 --> 01:13:40,771
我仍旧愿意发誓 他一定在什么地方留下了财产
Still, I swear he'd left money around someplace.

320
01:13:42,903 --> 01:13:45,572
如果你能发现就归你好了
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

321
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:48,402
马克贝恩夫人要回文明社会去了
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

322
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:52,151
少了一个丈夫，却多了一个好前程
Minus a husband and plus a great future.

323
01:14:04,966 --> 01:14:07,006
你应该过得更好
You deserve better.

324
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,216
上一个对我那样说的男人就埋在那儿
The last man who told me that is buried out there.

325
01:14:22,776 --> 01:14:25,231
知道吗，吉儿，你让我想到了我母亲
You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother.

326
01:14:28,823 --> 01:14:31,659
她是Alameida最出名的妓女
She was the biggest whore in Alameida

327
01:14:31,785 --> 01:14:34,869
世界上最好的女人
and the finest woman that ever lived.

328
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:39,449
无论我父亲是谁，一个小时抑或一个月...
Whoever my father was, for an hour or for a month,...

329
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,248
...他都一定是个开心的男人
..he must have been a happy man.

330
01:16:04,336 --> 01:16:06,375
你想要什么？
What do you want?

331
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:13,172
夏恩是对的。一旦你杀了四个人 很容易再去杀第五个
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed four, it's easy to make it five.

332
01:16:26,942 --> 01:16:29,397
现在还不是走的时候
This isn't the time to leave.

333
01:17:31,631 --> 01:17:33,838
给我点水
Give me some water.

334
01:17:43,018 --> 01:17:45,259
从井里
From the well.

335
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:49,023
我喜欢干净的水
I like my water fresh.

336
01:19:15,635 --> 01:19:19,218
如果你听到奇怪的声响，就匐倒在地上
When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.

337
01:19:19,347 --> 01:19:22,182
声响？什么声响？
A sound? Like what?

338
01:19:23,643 --> 01:19:25,054
就像那样
Like that.

339
01:19:56,092 --> 01:20:00,505
他不止会吹口琴，还能开枪
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

340
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:36,130
早上好，马克贝恩夫人
Morning, Mrs McBain.

341
01:20:36,257 --> 01:20:38,795
- 什么风把你吹到这儿来了？ - 早上好
- What brings you to town? - Good morning.

342
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:42,260
也许你不记得了，昨天在葬礼上...
Maybe you don't remember, but yesterday at the funeral...

343
01:20:42,388 --> 01:20:44,345
我记得很清楚
I remember very well.

344
01:20:44,474 --> 01:20:47,391
有什么我可以帮你的吗？
Is there something I can do for you?

345
01:20:48,436 --> 01:20:50,263
是的
Yes.

346
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:55,807
去见弗兰克。告诉他我什么都知道了
See Frank. And tell him I know everything.

347
01:20:55,944 --> 01:20:58,898
为什么么个人都找我打听弗兰克这家伙
Why is everybody hounding me about this guy Frank?

348
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,603
我不认识他 我从来都没有听说过这个人
I don't know him. I've never heard of him.

349
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:04,991
我也很苦恼，我想安安稳稳的生活
I got my own worries, and all I want is to be left in peace.

350
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:09,331
告诉弗兰克，我想和他谈判，亲自
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him. Personally.

351
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:07,463
告诉过你任何情况都不要来这里
You were told not to come here for any reason.

352
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:11,383
我不管你和弗兰克有什么交易 离这里远一点
Whatever business you have with Frank, keep it far away from here.

353
01:22:11,519 --> 01:22:15,137
我知道 但是当我听那个女人说他知道一切时
I know, but when I heard that woman say she knew everything,

354
01:22:15,273 --> 01:22:18,523
我觉得我应该来这儿告诉你这些
I thought I should come over here and tell you about it.

355
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:20,691
你没有想到会是个圈套吗？
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

356
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,192
当然，但是你知道我非常谨慎
Sure, but you know I'm mighty careful.

357
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:25,481
没有人能跟着我
No one could have followed me.

358
01:22:25,617 --> 01:22:28,487
那试我为你工作学到的第一件事
That's the first thing I learned, working for you.

359
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,075
去听看不到的，去看听不到的
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

360
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:35,499
你应该去学习如何仿佛不存在一样生活
You should learn to live as if you didn't exist.

361
01:22:35,627 --> 01:22:37,952
你认识我很长时间了，弗兰克
You've known me a long time, Frank.

362
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,045
你知道你可以相信我
You know you can trust me.

363
01:22:40,173 --> 01:22:41,833
无赖的家伙
Wobbles.

364
01:22:45,929 --> 01:22:50,306
谁会相信一个穿着吊带库却系皮带的家伙
How can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?

365
01:22:51,184 --> 01:22:53,971
他连自己的裤子都不相信
The man can't even trust his own pants.

366
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:05,190
我们离开这里
Let's get out of here.

367
01:24:44,881 --> 01:24:46,755
线路的终点
The end of the line.

368
01:24:49,844 --> 01:24:50,840
是啊
Yeah.

369
01:24:56,768 --> 01:24:58,178
带他上来
Get him on board.

370
01:25:12,867 --> 01:25:14,776
捆上他
Tie him up.

371
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,444
等一等，弗兰克
Wait, Frank.

372
01:25:50,571 --> 01:25:52,066
我没有...
I didn't...

373
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:53,692
好啊，没有人跟踪你？
So, nobody followed you?

374
01:25:54,284 --> 01:25:56,609
没有，你应该相信我
No. You gotta believe me.

375
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:00,325
我只能这样相信你
So, this is the way I can trust you.

376
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:03,244
我可以解释 我不知道那家伙...
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

377
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:06,660
- 滚出去 - 不，弗兰克
- Get out. - No, Frank.

378
01:26:07,422 --> 01:26:09,046
滚出去
Get out.

379
01:26:28,192 --> 01:26:30,351
弗兰克，等一下！
Frank, wait!

380
01:26:51,841 --> 01:26:54,925
我告诉你不要出声
I told you to keep quiet.

381
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:01,719
Logan和吉姆解决掉那个女人了吗？
Did Logan and Jim take care of the woman?

382
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:04,057
一些人在处理他们
Someone took care of them.

383
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:06,642
我们在马克贝恩家附近发现了他们
We found them out at McBain's place.

384
01:27:06,773 --> 01:27:09,774
死了 那个女人不见了
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

385
01:27:09,901 --> 01:27:13,601
你朋友们的死亡率很高么，弗兰克
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank.

386
01:27:25,124 --> 01:27:27,580
早先的三个，又有两个
First three, then two.

387
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:42,349
你就是那个约我的家伙
So you're the one who makes appointments.

388
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:46,727
你就是那个没有赴约的家伙
And you're the one who doesn't keep 'em.

389
01:27:49,315 --> 01:27:50,513
你想要什么？
What do you want?

390
01:27:51,693 --> 01:27:53,816
你是谁？
Who are you?

391
01:27:56,447 --> 01:27:58,072
戴夫.詹金斯
Dave Jenkins.

392
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:08,823
戴夫.詹金斯很久以前就死了
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

393
01:28:10,295 --> 01:28:12,003
卡德.本森
Calder Benson.

394
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,212
你的名字？ 本森也已经死了
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

395
01:28:18,177 --> 01:28:20,300
你应该比别人都清楚
You ought to know better than anyone.

396
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,958
你杀了他们？
You killed 'em.

397
01:28:22,285 --> 01:28:23,281
你是谁？
Who are you?

398
01:28:23,411 --> 01:28:25,653
- 你到底是谁？你... - 弗兰克！
- Who are you, you... - Frank!

399
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,324
那个女人
The woman.

400
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:34,660
我们这是在浪费时间
We're only losing time.

401
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:43,802
好吧。这次，我要亲自去会一会她
Alright. This time, I'll take care of her personally.

402
01:28:43,932 --> 01:28:46,423
对啊，这对你来说在容易不过了
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

403
01:28:51,314 --> 01:28:53,437
让他在这里暖和暖和
Keep him warm for me.

404
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:55,974
他要是找麻烦，就打他！
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

405
01:28:56,111 --> 01:29:00,523
不要打嘴 他还要讲话呢， 而且要说很多
Not in the mouth. He's got to talk. And plenty.

406
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,158
在纳瓦霍悬崖等我
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

407
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:11,207
给我好好看着那个跛子
Keep an eye on that cripple all the time.

408
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:12,876
知道了，弗兰克
Sure, Frank.

409
01:30:45,203 --> 01:30:47,694
- 看到什么人吗？ - 没有
- See anyone? - No.

410
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:09,850
就是他
There he is.

411
01:33:52,431 --> 01:33:54,923
你只知道怎么开枪？
You only know how to shoot?

412
01:33:56,978 --> 01:33:59,101
你也知道该怎么砍断绳索吧？
Or do you know how to cut, too?

413
01:34:10,741 --> 01:34:13,149
嗨，你
You.

414
01:34:13,995 --> 01:34:15,738
等一下
Wait a minute.

415
01:34:16,497 --> 01:34:19,664
让我们好好看看你
Let's have a good look at you.

416
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,094
火车先生（儿语）
Mr Choo-Choo.

417
01:34:51,449 --> 01:34:55,032
找到你很容易，你这个混蛋
It's easy to find you. Bastard.

418
01:34:55,161 --> 01:34:57,450
我现在没有必要杀你
I don't have to kill you now.

419
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,952
你像蜗牛一样留下粘液
You leave a slime behind you like a snail.

420
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:04,163
两条美丽的亮闪闪的铁轨
Two beautiful shiny rails.

421
01:35:04,837 --> 01:35:06,379
还有另外一个混蛋
There's another bastard.

422
01:35:06,964 --> 01:35:09,502
他离我们越来越远
And he's getting further away every minute.

423
01:35:22,146 --> 01:35:25,100
这就是了 你丈夫给我买的
There it is. What your husband ordered from me.

424
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:29,313
他付了我现金， 现在都是属于你的了
And seeing as how he paid cash, it all belongs to you.

425
01:35:29,445 --> 01:35:32,695
橡木，厚木板，榉木，松木
Oak planks, beech, pine.

426
01:35:32,824 --> 01:35:34,863
都是一流的木材
All first-grade lumber.

427
01:35:34,992 --> 01:35:37,662
还有这些横梁，路基
And there's beams and foundation pylons.

428
01:35:37,787 --> 01:35:41,385
十桶钉子，二十桶柏油，和所有的工具
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar, and all these tools.

429
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:44,407
也许他需要用这些来扩大农庄
Maybe he wanted to enlarge the farmhouse.

430
01:35:44,544 --> 01:35:46,453
扩大农庄？
Enlarge the farmhouse?

431
01:35:46,587 --> 01:35:49,791
他都可以建八个农庄了
He could have built at least eight of them.

432
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:51,798
顺便问一下，女士
By the way, ma'am,

433
01:35:51,926 --> 01:35:55,461
马克贝恩还买了这个，说是很重要
McBain also ordered this. Said it was important.

434
01:35:55,596 --> 01:36:00,223
但是他好像忘记告诉我他想在上面刷什么
Only it seems he forgot to tell me what he wanted printed on it.

435
01:36:07,483 --> 01:36:08,894
车站
Station.

436
01:36:09,902 --> 01:36:11,100
你说什么？
How's that again?

437
01:36:11,237 --> 01:36:13,858
我说了，在上面刷“车站”
I said print "station".

438
01:36:45,772 --> 01:36:47,811
在找这个吗?
Looking for this?

439
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:50,941
我受够了你的屠夫战术
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

440
01:36:51,068 --> 01:36:53,441
我知道那个女人在这儿
I know that woman is here.

441
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:56,358
我不希望再有无谓的残杀
I don't want any more useless killing.

442
01:36:56,491 --> 01:36:59,610
我想跟你买那块地
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

443
01:36:59,744 --> 01:37:01,867
付给你应得的那份
To pay what's necessary.

444
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:04,404
我不想再浪费任何时间
I don't want to waste any more time.

445
01:37:05,374 --> 01:37:07,616
你犯了个大错，莫顿
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

446
01:37:11,506 --> 01:37:15,717
当你不在那列火车上的时候 你就像个缩头乌龟一样
When you're not on that train, you look like a turtle out of its shell.

447
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:18,254
真有趣
Just funny.

448
01:37:18,387 --> 01:37:22,599
外表可怜的瘸子，还善于吹牛 所以没有人知道你真正的可怕面目
Poor cripple talking big so nobody'll know how scared you are.

449
01:37:22,725 --> 01:37:24,552
弗兰克，我来这里是跟你做交易的
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

450
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:30,144
我没有时间跟你争
I don't have time to compete with you.

451
01:37:35,863 --> 01:37:37,655
跟我争？
Compete?

452
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:46,242
为什么？ 你...你自己站都站不稳
Why, you... You can't even stand on your own feet by yourself.

453
01:37:56,884 --> 01:37:59,554
这样足够证明你强壮了吗？
Is that sufficient to make you feel stronger?

454
01:38:00,388 --> 01:38:03,638
我能把你像烂苹果一样压扁
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

455
01:38:05,393 --> 01:38:08,477
当然，不过你不会那样做
Sure, but you won't do it.

456
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:12,516
因为那对你没什么好处
Because it's not to your advantage.

457
01:38:19,991 --> 01:38:22,992
不知道你还能用你那完好的脚走多远
Who knows how far you'd have gone with two good legs.

458
01:38:31,169 --> 01:38:34,668
把他带回火车，看着他
Help him back to the train. Keep your eye on him.

459
01:38:37,133 --> 01:38:40,003
莫顿 不用担心那块地
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

460
01:38:40,136 --> 01:38:42,591
如果你想付钱的话，你可以付
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

461
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:46,422
不过这对你来说也没有什么区别 去跟新主人说吧
It won't make any difference to you, dealing with the new owner.

462
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:15,962
夏恩！
Cheyenne!

463
01:39:16,088 --> 01:39:19,292
这里有个方树桩，上面写着“水槽”
There's a square staked out here. It says "water tank".

464
01:39:19,425 --> 01:39:23,589
这里也有一个，不过写着“邮局”
Over here, too. Only, it says "post office".

465
01:39:23,721 --> 01:39:25,714
这个写着“畜栏”
And this one says "corral".

466
01:39:25,848 --> 01:39:28,173
这里写着“教堂”
And this here "church".

467
01:39:28,768 --> 01:39:31,306
这些都他妈的是什么东西？
What the hell is this?

468
01:39:31,437 --> 01:39:32,766
你难道看不出来吗？
Can't you see?

469
01:39:34,023 --> 01:39:35,398
这是一个火车站
It's a station.

470
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,188
所有围绕它的是一个小镇
And all around it, a town.

471
01:39:41,614 --> 01:39:43,820
布赖特.马克贝恩的小镇
Brett McBain's town.

472
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:48,740
他疯了！
Was he crazy!

473
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:51,197
是呀，从某个特定的角度说
Yeah, in a very special way.

474
01:39:53,209 --> 01:39:55,285
一个爱尔兰人
An lrishman.

475
01:39:56,629 --> 01:40:01,374
他知道经过石板镇的铁路会继续往西去
He knew that railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on west.

476
01:40:01,509 --> 01:40:04,296
所以他研究了全国的情况来到了这里
So he looked over all this country out here

477
01:40:04,428 --> 01:40:07,002
直到他发现了这片沙漠
until he found this hunk of desert.

478
01:40:07,932 --> 01:40:09,925
没有人需要它
Nobody wanted it.

479
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,225
但是他却买了下来
But he bought it.

480
01:40:17,942 --> 01:40:22,438
然后缩衣节食的过了很多年，他在等待
Then he tightened his belt, and for years, he waited.

481
01:40:23,948 --> 01:40:25,988
他在等待什么呢？
Waited for what?

482
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:30,162
他在等待铁路修到这里
For the railroad to reach this point.

483
01:40:30,288 --> 01:40:35,709
可是他是怎么知道铁路一定会经过他的领地？
But how could he be sure the railroad would pass through his property?

484
01:40:37,295 --> 01:40:40,212
那些蒸汽机，运转离不开水
Them steam engines can't roll without water.

485
01:40:40,339 --> 01:40:45,678
在石板镇往西50英里以内 有水的地方只有这里
And the only water for 50 miles west of Flagstone is right here.

486
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:46,966
在这片土地下面
Under this land.

487
01:40:48,097 --> 01:40:51,383
他不是个傻瓜，我们亲爱的朋友
He was no fool, our dead friend.

488
01:40:51,517 --> 01:40:56,013
他打算用这块沙漠换取相同重量的金子
He was going to sell this piece of desert for its weight in gold.

489
01:40:56,814 --> 01:40:59,649
你不会卖掉你毕生的梦想
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

490
01:41:01,277 --> 01:41:03,768
布赖特.马克贝恩只是想要他的车站
Brett McBain wanted his station.

491
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:08,487
他有权利建造它
He got the rights to build it.

492
01:41:10,745 --> 01:41:13,699
- 你是怎么知道这些的？ - 我看过一份文件
- How do you know all this? - I saw a document.

493
01:41:13,831 --> 01:41:16,916
一切都井井有条 图章，签字，所有一切
It was all in order. Seals, signatures, everything.

494
01:41:18,127 --> 01:41:19,456
只有一件东西
One thing, though.

495
01:41:19,587 --> 01:41:24,048
用很小的字写的，是个简短的条款。
In very small print, there is a short clause,

496
01:41:24,175 --> 01:41:28,042
说马克贝恩或者他的继承人会失去所有的权利
which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights

497
01:41:28,179 --> 01:41:31,512
如果铁路到达这个地方的时候...
if, by the time the railroad reaches this point,...

498
01:41:32,725 --> 01:41:34,884
...车站还没有建造好
..the station ain't built yet.

499
01:41:41,776 --> 01:41:45,987
说到铁路，我想起了路匪
Speaking of railroads, I noticed the rail gang's already...

500
01:41:49,575 --> 01:41:53,359
我注意到路匪早就藏在这些山的后面
I noticed the rail gang's already behind those hills.

501
01:41:53,496 --> 01:41:58,324
在你注意到这点之前，他们就会来到这里
And before you know it, they're gonna be here.

502
01:41:58,459 --> 01:41:59,740
是啊
Yeah.

503
01:41:59,877 --> 01:42:01,253
是啊
Yeah.

504
01:42:02,338 --> 01:42:03,963
听着
Listen.

505
01:42:04,715 --> 01:42:06,126
口琴家
Harmonica.

506
01:42:07,176 --> 01:42:10,343
一个小镇要是建造在铁路附近
A town built around the railroad.

507
01:42:12,098 --> 01:42:14,387
你就可以发财了
You could make a fortune.

508
01:42:15,435 --> 01:42:18,270
成百个一千美元
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

509
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:21,478
或者更多
More than that.

510
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:25,141
成千个一千...
Thousands of thousands.

511
01:42:25,987 --> 01:42:28,394
他们说那是上百万
They call them millions.

512
01:42:29,532 --> 01:42:31,275
上百万？
Millions?

513
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,409
- 对，上百万 - 是啊
- Yeah, millions. - Yeah.

514
01:42:36,539 --> 01:42:41,367
我一直在想 如果跟一个聪明的女士做生意会来得容易些
I always thought it'd be easier to make a deal with a smart lady.

515
01:42:41,502 --> 01:42:43,993
你所要做的就是...
All you gotta do is...

516
01:42:46,132 --> 01:42:49,465
你们他妈的都一个个杵在这里做什么？
What in the hell are you standing around for?

517
01:42:50,052 --> 01:42:52,175
头儿，我们应该做什么？
Chief, what are we supposed to do?

518
01:42:52,305 --> 01:42:54,511
你们应该做什么？
What are you supposed to do?

519
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,131
建造车站，笨蛋！
Build a station, idiots!

520
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:02,434
我想她不一定会喜欢这个车站
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

521
01:43:05,943 --> 01:43:10,404
但是，当她回来的时候 这将是她所看见的第一件东西
But it'll be the first thing she sees when she gets back.

522
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,440
如果她会回来的话
If she gets back.

523
01:44:32,905 --> 01:44:34,697
我想...
I think...

524
01:44:42,915 --> 01:44:44,540
是啊
Yeah.

525
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:49,546
我想，如果杀了你的话我会很后悔
I'm beginning to think I might be a little sorry killing you.

526
01:44:51,507 --> 01:44:54,342
你喜欢活着
You like being alive.

527
01:45:07,482 --> 01:45:10,815
你也喜欢男人的手抚摸你的全身
You also like to feel a man's hands all over you.

528
01:45:12,653 --> 01:45:14,776
你喜欢这样
You like it.

529
01:45:18,493 --> 01:45:22,158
甚至那是杀了你丈夫的那个男人的双手
Even if they're the hands of the man who killed your husband.

530
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:44,592
啊...
What a...

531
01:45:47,396 --> 01:45:49,472
真是个小骚货
What a little tramp.

532
01:45:51,943 --> 01:45:56,521
在这个世界上是不是 没有比保养皮肤更重要的事情了？
Is there anything in the world you wouldn't do to save your skin?

533
01:45:59,951 --> 01:46:02,239
没有了，弗兰克。
Nothing, Frank.

534
01:46:25,476 --> 01:46:28,430
现在我明白了为什么他们那么想念你...
Now I understand why they miss you so much...

535
01:46:29,856 --> 01:46:33,640
...在那里，在新奥尔良
..down there in New Orleans.

536
01:46:36,404 --> 01:46:38,895
伟大的发明，电报
Great invention, the telegraph.

537
01:46:42,493 --> 01:46:45,280
“吉儿？那个深色皮肤的女人？”
"Jill? The brunette?"

538
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:50,124
“波旁街上妓院里的那个 最有绅士风度的客人
"The customers of the most elegant whorehouse on Bourbon Street

539
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:53,371
自从她离开了之后，一直伤心哭泣
have been weeping ever since she left."

540
01:46:55,798 --> 01:46:57,838
说，告诉我
Say, tell me.

541
01:46:58,843 --> 01:47:00,919
老马克贝恩知道这些吗？
Did old McBain know?

542
01:47:01,637 --> 01:47:03,677
当然
Yeah.

543
01:47:03,806 --> 01:47:06,131
当然，我打赌他知道
Yeah, I bet he did.

544
01:47:06,267 --> 01:47:09,351
只有他才是那种跟妓女结婚的人
He was just the type to marry a whore.

545
01:47:14,984 --> 01:47:17,190
我有个好主意
It's an idea.

546
01:47:19,113 --> 01:47:21,153
我可以跟你结婚
I could marry you.

547
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:24,649
不过那块土地要属于我
And the land would become mine.

548
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:27,320
或许...
And maybe...

549
01:47:29,457 --> 01:47:31,995
或许你能成为一个完美的妻子
..you'd make a perfect wife.

550
01:47:35,713 --> 01:47:39,331
不过我不会是一个好丈夫
It would be me who wouldn't be any good as a husband.

551
01:47:41,093 --> 01:47:42,920
太坏了
Too bad.

552
01:47:43,054 --> 01:47:46,553
我们必须另外想出一个解决的办法
We'll have to think of another solution.

553
01:47:46,682 --> 01:47:48,307
更简单
Simpler.

554
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:55,228
更快捷
Quicker.

555
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:18,661
作为本郡的行政长官
As sheriff of this county,

556
01:48:18,798 --> 01:48:22,083
我被邀请主持这次拍卖
I've been asked to preside over the sale by auction

557
01:48:22,218 --> 01:48:26,714
所有属于吉儿.马克贝恩夫人的财产
of all property belonging to Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

558
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:30,759
这片土地总共320英亩
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

559
01:48:30,893 --> 01:48:35,187
没有任何纠纷，留置权和抵押
It's free of all encumbrances, liens and mortgages.

560
01:48:36,107 --> 01:48:38,230
这块地及其所含
This property and all it contains,

561
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:40,684
所有的资产
Iock, stock and barrel,

562
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:44,319
都将在成交之时过户给幸运的买主
will be turned over to the lucky purchaser at the time of sale.

563
01:48:44,449 --> 01:48:47,070
所有的东西都编号排列在
All the contents therein are listed by number

564
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:50,155
分发给你们的存货表格上
on the inventory sheet distributed among you.

565
01:48:50,288 --> 01:48:54,202
全部财产将捆绑卖给出价最高的投标人
The entire property will be sold in block to the highest bidder.

566
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:57,287
好了。大家都明白了吧
Alright. That's clear to everybody.

567
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,247
我宣布拍卖开始
I declare the auction open.

568
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,515
现在，谁第一个竞拍？
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

569
01:49:07,271 --> 01:49:11,399
所有物品的清单 有些东西还是很值钱的
A list of all the items. Some of them are worth money.

570
01:49:12,485 --> 01:49:16,019
好了，现在 谁第一个竞拍？
Alright. Now, who's going to make the first bid?

571
01:49:20,284 --> 01:49:22,526
200美元
$200.

572
01:49:22,661 --> 01:49:25,152
好，我们有人出价200美元
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

573
01:49:25,915 --> 01:49:29,165
200美元。有没有更多的？
$200. Do I hear more?

574
01:49:29,293 --> 01:49:33,421
那块臭地不值那么多钱
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

575
01:49:33,547 --> 01:49:36,548
哦，朋友，200美元
Come on, my friends, $200.

576
01:49:36,675 --> 01:49:39,795
那些牲畜就值两倍的价钱
The livestock alone is worth twice that much.

577
01:49:41,263 --> 01:49:43,007
那么...
Well...

578
01:49:44,016 --> 01:49:46,222
有人出300美元吗？
Who's going to bid $300?

579
01:49:50,356 --> 01:49:55,267
现在，朋友们 我知道我们不是在拍卖加州
Now, look, friends, I realise we're not offering California here,

580
01:49:55,403 --> 01:49:58,653
但是200美元对于这块土地也太少了点
but 200 is damn little for all that property.

581
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:02,861
女士们，先生们，我不会接受200美元的押金
Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

582
01:50:06,122 --> 01:50:09,455
嗯，没有人再加价了吗？
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

583
01:50:17,383 --> 01:50:20,337
你确信你不需要设一个最低竞价吗？
You're sure you wouldn't want to set a minimum price?

584
01:50:22,805 --> 01:50:25,047
我希望我是错的，马克贝恩夫人
I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

585
01:50:25,182 --> 01:50:29,394
但是你有义务结束这次拍卖，就算卖得很便宜
but you're liable to end up selling the place for a plate of beans.

586
01:50:35,234 --> 01:50:37,274
我只想把它卖了
All I want is to sell.

587
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:48,136
- 你真胖 - 如果你那么说
- You're fat. - If you say so.

588
01:51:48,265 --> 01:51:49,973
- 多少？ - 一张牌
- How many? - One card.

589
01:51:52,228 --> 01:51:54,434
给我一张
One for me.

590
01:51:56,899 --> 01:51:58,808
庄家拿三张
Dealer takes three.

591
01:52:09,495 --> 01:52:12,745
我能加入吗？
Can I take a hand?

592
01:52:17,962 --> 01:52:19,504


593
01:52:32,393 --> 01:52:35,014
行啊，坐下
Yeah, sit down.

594
01:52:58,753 --> 01:53:00,626
我做庄
I'll deal.

595
01:54:44,775 --> 01:54:47,527
你怎么...
How do you...

596
01:54:47,653 --> 01:54:50,524
你怎么玩法, 莫顿先生
How do you play this game, Mr Morton?

597
01:54:52,825 --> 01:54:55,067
很简单
It's very simple.

598
01:54:55,995 --> 01:55:00,870
只要用脑子，你就不会输
As long as you use your head, you never lose.

599
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,335
500美元
$500.

600
01:55:08,674 --> 01:55:10,880
500美元
$500.

601
01:55:12,052 --> 01:55:14,294
还有没有更高的价钱？
Do I hear any other bids?

602
01:55:16,348 --> 01:55:18,839
没有了
I don't think so.

603
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,188
对不起，马克贝恩夫人
I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

604
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:34,231
但是我想我要最后敲定价钱了
but I think I'm gonna have to knock down on that last bid.

605
01:55:45,461 --> 01:55:47,916
500美元一次
$500 once.

606
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:53,046
500美元两次
$500 twice.

607
01:55:55,596 --> 01:55:57,719
- 500美元... - 5000美元
- $500... - $5,000.

608
01:56:21,455 --> 01:56:26,746
- 是你说5000美元吗？ - 他来了
- You said $5,000? - It's on its way.

609
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:41,975
那是夏恩
It's Cheyenne!

610
01:56:50,526 --> 01:56:53,860
这个家伙值5000美元赏金，对吗？
The reward for this man is $5,000, that's right?

611
01:56:53,988 --> 01:56:58,697
犹大满足于4,970美元或更少
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

612
01:56:58,826 --> 01:57:01,317
那个时候他们不用美元
There were no dollars in them days.

613
01:57:03,372 --> 01:57:05,828
但是他奶奶的，是啊
But sons of bitches, yeah.

614
01:57:20,181 --> 01:57:22,469
等一下
Wait a minute.

615
01:57:24,143 --> 01:57:27,393
- 监狱在那边 - 是啊，我知道
- The jail's that way. - Yeah, I know.

616
01:57:27,521 --> 01:57:31,056
是啊，但是你在去火车站
Yeah, but you're going to the railroad station.

617
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:34,480
我要送你去尤马, 夏恩
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

618
01:57:34,612 --> 01:57:36,604
那儿有座现代化的监狱
They got a modern jail there.

619
01:57:36,739 --> 01:57:41,567
那里有更多的墙，更多的栅栏 和更多的侍卫
It's got more walls, more bars, more guards.

620
01:57:41,702 --> 01:57:45,700
你会喜欢的，在那里20年，你会知道的
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

621
01:58:47,268 --> 01:58:50,684
两张票，朋友，去下一站
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

622
01:58:50,813 --> 01:58:52,936
单程
One way only.

623
01:58:54,859 --> 01:58:57,813
这是给你的 祝贺你
Here's to you. And congratulations.

624
01:59:02,616 --> 01:59:04,858
你做了个好买卖
You got yourself a good deal.

625
01:59:06,328 --> 01:59:07,609
拍卖
The auction.

626
01:59:08,706 --> 01:59:12,075
忘了他吧，我没有投资那块地
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

627
01:59:14,211 --> 01:59:18,838
你一点儿也不像个高尚的 保护可怜无助的寡妇的人
You don't look at all like the noble defender of poor defenceless widows.

628
01:59:20,885 --> 01:59:22,842
不过，也是...
But then again,...

629
01:59:25,848 --> 01:59:29,264
...我也不像一个可怜无助的寡妇
..I don't look like a poor defenceless widow.

630
01:59:35,775 --> 01:59:38,729
夏恩是对的， 你是一个不平常的女人
Cheyenne's right. You're a remarkable woman.

631
01:59:39,779 --> 01:59:42,104
你是一个不平常的男人
And you're a remarkable man.

632
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,909
但是你现在已经想到什么了
But you have something on your mind.

633
01:59:51,332 --> 01:59:54,202
你想到什么了？
Have you got something on your mind?

634
01:59:56,837 --> 02:00:00,621
热水 满满一澡盆热水
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

635
02:00:19,276 --> 02:00:22,147
我想是时候了 我去放水
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

636
02:00:53,602 --> 02:00:55,595
你是谁？
Who are you?

637
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,289
吉姆.库珀
Jim Cooper.

638
02:01:18,419 --> 02:01:20,127
查克.扬不拉德
Chuck Youngblood.

639
02:01:21,046 --> 02:01:22,873
多一个死人
More dead men.

640
02:01:26,343 --> 02:01:29,179
要不是遇见了你，他们都还活着，弗兰克
They were all alive until they met you, Frank.

641
02:01:35,519 --> 02:01:39,184
你为那属于我的东西付了5000美元
You paid $5,000 for something that belongs to me.

642
02:01:43,986 --> 02:01:46,275
5,000……
5,000...

643
02:01:50,326 --> 02:01:52,615
...加上一块钱
..plus one.

644
02:01:57,583 --> 02:01:59,872
你也有权利得到一点利润
You've got a right to make a profit, too.

645
02:02:26,812 --> 02:02:30,146
如果我是你的话，我不会想太久
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it, if I were you.

646
02:02:34,486 --> 02:02:37,487
你把自己卷入了自己能力之外的事情
You got yourself into something bigger than you.

647
02:02:37,615 --> 02:02:40,485
你现在有机会全身而退，最好收下
You got a chance to get out easy. You better take it.

648
02:02:40,618 --> 02:02:43,821
你像一个真正的生意人，弗兰克
You sound like a real businessman, Frank.

649
02:02:43,954 --> 02:02:47,121
跟莫顿先生在一起对你很有帮助
Being with Mr Morton's done you a lot of good.

650
02:02:55,424 --> 02:02:58,093
而且你还学到一些新方法
And you've learned some new methods.

651
02:02:59,345 --> 02:03:02,132
是的，莫顿先生教了我很多新的方法
Yeah, Mr Morton has shown you a lot of new ways.

652
02:03:06,894 --> 02:03:09,515
虽然你还没有放弃你的老方法
Even though you haven't given up the old ones.

653
02:03:10,981 --> 02:03:14,066
任选一种你喜欢的方法 做完这宗买卖
Pick any method you like. Just make the deal.

654
02:03:16,528 --> 02:03:18,153
哪一宗买卖，弗兰克
Which deal, Frank?

655
02:03:20,824 --> 02:03:23,113
我们不止一宗，你我之间
We have more than one, you and me.

656
02:03:26,997 --> 02:03:32,371
我们可以把它们捆在一起，一起解决
We can lump them together into one bundle, settle all of them.

657
02:03:32,503 --> 02:03:34,745
就这儿，现在
Here and now.

658
02:03:36,882 --> 02:03:38,590
放松，弗兰克
Easy, Frank.

659
02:03:39,176 --> 02:03:40,718
放松
Easy.

660
02:03:41,387 --> 02:03:43,593
你要学习如何解决问题
You gotta learn not to push things.

661
02:03:43,722 --> 02:03:46,889
放轻松是一个生意人必须作的第一件事
Taking it easy is the first thing a businessman should do.

662
02:03:50,145 --> 02:03:53,811
我有个主意 莫顿先生能教你更多的东西
I got an idea Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

663
02:03:58,404 --> 02:04:00,112
多少钱？
How much?

664
02:04:00,823 --> 02:04:01,902
一块钱
One dollar.

665
02:05:07,389 --> 02:05:09,014
驾！
Giddy up!

666
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:44,736
驾！
Giddy up!

667
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:51,670
我发誓我们会听到那种奇怪的声音
I'd swear we're going to have that strange sound.

668
02:07:51,804 --> 02:07:52,717
现在
Right now.

669
02:09:45,709 --> 02:09:47,666
时间过得真快
Time sure flies.

670
02:09:48,921 --> 02:09:51,412
已经过了12点了
It's already past 1 2.

671
02:10:50,190 --> 02:10:52,516
但是他们是他的人
But they were his men.

672
02:10:52,651 --> 02:10:55,023
- 是啊 - 他们想要杀了他
- Yeah. - And they tried to kill him.

673
02:10:55,154 --> 02:10:57,396
有人出更高的价
They found somebody who pays better.

674
02:10:57,531 --> 02:11:01,232
你！你却救了他
And you! You saved his life.

675
02:11:03,412 --> 02:11:06,413
我只是不让他们杀他 那不是一回事
I didn't let them kill him. That's not the same thing.

676
02:11:19,428 --> 02:11:21,504
对
Sure.

677
02:11:21,639 --> 02:11:24,011
那不是一回事
It's not the same thing.

678
02:11:31,106 --> 02:11:32,850
你快穿好衣服
You get dressed.

679
02:11:32,983 --> 02:11:34,228
是时候回家了
It's time to go home.

680
02:16:54,305 --> 02:16:55,847
煮咖啡了吗？
Did you make coffee?

681
02:16:57,816 --> 02:16:59,892
这次我煮了
This time I did.

682
02:17:39,524 --> 02:17:41,766
味道很好
Good.

683
02:17:43,654 --> 02:17:46,738
我母亲就是这样煮咖啡的
My mother used to make coffee this way.

684
02:17:47,616 --> 02:17:52,194
热热的，浓浓的，而且味道很好
Hot, strong and good.

685
02:18:01,755 --> 02:18:03,463
夏恩
Cheyenne.

686
02:18:05,676 --> 02:18:07,964
他在那里等什么？
What's he waiting for out there?

687
02:18:10,639 --> 02:18:11,635
他在做什么？
What's he doing?

688
02:18:17,729 --> 02:18:19,971
他在削一块木头
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

689
02:18:22,442 --> 02:18:25,693
我有预感当他削完的时候...
I got a feeling when he stops whittling,...

690
02:18:26,989 --> 02:18:29,065
...会有什么事情发生
..something's gonna happen.

691
02:19:37,559 --> 02:19:39,386
见到我很吃惊吗？
Surprised to see me here?

692
02:19:41,438 --> 02:19:43,478
我知道你会来的
I knew you'd come.

693
02:20:06,964 --> 02:20:09,918
莫顿曾经跟我说过 我永远都不会跟他一样
Morton once told me I could never be like him.

694
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:13,543
现在我知道为什么了
Now I understand why.

695
02:20:15,389 --> 02:20:19,683
如果没有去找他 你就会知道你还是属于某个地方
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.

696
02:20:20,936 --> 02:20:24,768
所以你发现你根本就不是一个生意人？
So you found out you're not a businessman after all?

697
02:20:24,898 --> 02:20:27,021
只是一个人而已
Just a man.

698
02:20:28,402 --> 02:20:30,643
一个古老的人种
An ancient race.

699
02:20:36,368 --> 02:20:41,279
其他的莫顿们会过来，他们会把它消灭
Other Mortons will be along and they'll kill it off.

700
02:20:41,415 --> 02:20:43,538
未来跟我们无关
The future don't matter to us.

701
02:20:43,667 --> 02:20:45,245
现在也无关
Nothing matters now.

702
02:20:45,377 --> 02:20:48,711
不为土地，不为钱，也不为女人
Not the land, not the money, not the woman.

703
02:20:49,339 --> 02:20:51,379
我来这里是要找你
I came here to see you.

704
02:20:53,677 --> 02:20:56,797
因为我知道你现在会告诉我你在寻找什么？
Cos I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.

705
02:21:11,987 --> 02:21:14,822
只有在死亡的那一刻
Only at the point of dying.

706
02:21:17,701 --> 02:21:19,824
我知道
I know.

707
02:22:03,497 --> 02:22:07,115
我为你热了一些水，我还找到一个剃刀
I heated some water for you. I also found a razor.

708
02:22:08,168 --> 02:22:10,208
放在那儿好了
Put it there, please.

709
02:22:12,923 --> 02:22:16,541
我可以在剃胡子的时候看着到火车开过来
So I can watch the railroad move up while I shave.

710
02:22:22,724 --> 02:22:24,100
你知道吗？
You know what?

711
02:22:25,852 --> 02:22:29,802
如果我是你，我就会下去给那些人一些水喝
If I was you, I'd go down there and give those boys a drink.

712
02:22:38,407 --> 02:22:41,277
你不能想象
You can't imagine

713
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:45,158
能看到你这样的女人会让男人有多么高兴
how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you.

714
02:22:46,957 --> 02:22:49,246
只是看着她
Just to look at her.

715
02:22:52,421 --> 02:22:56,121
如果其中有人在后面拍你...
And if one of them should pat your behind,...

716
02:22:57,718 --> 02:23:00,387
...就装作什么都没有
..just make believe it's nothing.

717
02:23:03,056 --> 02:23:05,215
他们值得那个
They earned it.

718
02:27:39,124 --> 02:27:41,413
让你亲爱的兄弟高兴
Keep your loving brother happy.

719
02:31:00,659 --> 02:31:02,652
你是谁？
Who are you?

720
02:32:12,689 --> 02:32:14,397
你是个英俊的男人
You're sort of a handsome man.

721
02:32:17,611 --> 02:32:19,603
但是我不是那个人
But I'm not the right man.

722
02:32:32,542 --> 02:32:34,416
他也不是
And neither is he.

723
02:32:37,047 --> 02:32:39,040
或许不是
Maybe not.

724
02:32:39,174 --> 02:32:41,250
但是那不重要了
But it doesn't matter.

725
02:32:44,846 --> 02:32:47,634
你不明白，吉儿
You don't understand, Jill.

726
02:32:48,267 --> 02:32:51,137
那样的人总是有些东西藏在心里
People like that have something inside.

727
02:32:53,814 --> 02:32:56,020
一些跟死亡有关的东西
Something to do with death.

728
02:32:59,987 --> 02:33:04,067
如果那个家伙还活着，他会从那扇门进来
If that fella lives, he'll come in through that door,

729
02:33:04,199 --> 02:33:07,319
拿起他的行李说再见
pick up his gear and say adios.

730
02:33:12,749 --> 02:33:15,999
能看到这个小镇建成真得很好
It would be nice to see this town grow.

731
02:34:47,219 --> 02:34:49,544
现在我要走了
Now I gotta go.

732
02:35:34,891 --> 02:35:38,177
这里将成为一个美丽的小镇，甜水
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

733
02:35:43,150 --> 02:35:45,475
我希望你将来能回来
I hope you'll come back someday.

734
02:36:03,253 --> 02:36:05,080
将来
Someday.

735
02:36:16,850 --> 02:36:20,515
是啊，我也要走了
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

736
02:36:46,713 --> 02:36:48,789
让人们相信什么都没有发生过
Make believe it's nothing.

737
02:38:54,383 --> 02:38:56,422
对不起，口琴家
Sorry, Harmonica.

738
02:38:56,551 --> 02:38:58,509
我要留在这里了
I gotta stay here.

739
02:39:36,758 --> 02:39:38,217
谁干的？
Who?

740
02:39:41,513 --> 02:39:44,087
我遇到了火车先生
I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

741
02:39:44,975 --> 02:39:48,344
我没有考虑到火车上那个废人
I didn't count on that half-man from the train.

742
02:39:49,229 --> 02:39:51,138
他看起来很害怕
He got scared.

743
02:40:09,458 --> 02:40:11,415
口琴家
Harmonica.

744
02:40:12,377 --> 02:40:14,417
当他们射中你的时候
When they do you in,

745
02:40:14,546 --> 02:40:17,464
真希望那家伙知道该往哪儿打
pray it's somebody who knows where to shoot.

746
02:40:33,148 --> 02:40:34,311
走开
Go away.

747
02:40:36,735 --> 02:40:39,191
走开
Go away.

748
02:40:39,321 --> 02:40:42,322
走开 我不希望你看着我死
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
