00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,462
到边境还有多远
How far to the border?

6
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:06,249
不远了  我去年还来过这儿 
Not far. Unless they changed it again 

7
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,516
除非他们改道了
since I was here last.

8
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:12,301
在这从波兰到德国就像
Round here a man can rise from his bed in Poland,

9
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:16,262
一个人从起床到厨房一样近
go down to the kitchen and find himself in Germany.

10
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,542
你会好起来的 他们告诉我的

11
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:30,431
到时候去踢足球 怎么样   
Playing football soon, eh?  

12
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,824
希望如此吧 先生
I hope so, sir.

13
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:34,941
- 你去过那里几次?   - 是的
- You've been over there a few times?  - Yes.

14
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,548
你是不是看到了什么  
Did you see something? 

15
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,660
让他们这么生气地朝你开枪?
That made them angry enough to shoot you?

16
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:43,341
看到了带着铲子和机器的士兵
Soldiers. With shovels and machinery.

17

19
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:59,661
在他们加强边防之后不要去那边

20
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,542
- 有巡逻么?   - 每两个小时一次
- Are there patrols?  - Every two hours.

21
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:05,942
我们需要靠近点看
We should take a closer look.

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,959
两周后就是新月了   
There's a new moon in two weeks.  

23
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,438

27
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,380
那位英勇的中校是做什么的
And what does the gallant Colonel do?

28
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,620
他是法国大使馆的军队随员

29
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,702
他来华沙只有6个月

30
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:19,821
- 结婚了么?   - 或者丧偶?
- Married?  - Widowed?

31
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,742
别满怀期望了 Cecylia
Don't get your hopes up, Cecylia.

32
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,502
我早对他有意了
I already have my eye on him.

33
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,062
这个疤怎么来的
How did this happen?

34
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:15,422
刺刀伤的
A bayonet.

35
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:19,462
这个呢
And this?

36
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,662
被狙击手打中了
A sniper's bullet.

37
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,222
我还该看看哪里呢
Where else should I look?

38
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:32,657
医生说在我的左腿膝盖里
The doctor says there's still some shrapnel 

39
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,861
还有一些弹片
in my left knee.

40
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:37,902
你这一代的大多数男人多少有些这样的伤疤
Most men of your generation have scars of some sort.

41
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:41,395
除非 像我丈夫那样 
Unless, like my husband, 

42
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:44,326
战争期间他们躲在家里 中饱私囊
they spent the war at home and got rich.

43
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:47,901
嗯 如果再来一次战争他会变得更富有
Well, if there's another he'll get even richer.

44
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:49,582
真是乱说话 确实
Crazy talk, surely

45
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,901
伯爵夫人!
Countess!

46
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,342
我...我才...我才想着...
I was... I was... I was beginning to think...

47
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:11,582
香槟  你个淘气鬼
Champagne! You wicked boy.

48

00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:43,661
- 你脸色不太好   - 睡太少了
- You look pale.  - Too little sleep.

50
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:46,261
你带了什么来?

51
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,142
第一批新坦克炮塔的图纸
The first diagrams for the new tank turret.

52
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:53,741
有什么不同?
What's different?

53
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:54,931
是一样的  
It's the same. 

54
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:56,509
但是现在这些护板都是...
But now the plates are to be...

55
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,396
你的啤酒
One beer for you.

56
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:02,442
这些护板都经过表面硬化
The plates are to be face-hardened.

57
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:03,704
这意味着是渗碳处理过的
That means carbon cementation.

58
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,820
非常昂贵 但是强度得以大幅增加
Very expensive but the strength is greatly increased.

59
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,740
下次我们想要看到
Next time we'd like to see the formula

60
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:08,987
表面硬化工艺的配方

61
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:12,115
下次? 我不确定
Next time? I'm not sure

62
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:12,675
我可以在...   
I'll be able...  

63
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,536
就11月15号

64
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,149
麻烦太多了
There are many problems.

65
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,904
这种工作总会有麻烦的
There are always problems in this sort of work

66
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:18,187
但是酬劳优越
but you can use the money.

67
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,929
伯爵夫人的品位很高
The Countess has expensive tastes.

68
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:24,062
这是一千兹罗提

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
他们来这出售他们的坦克的
They're coming here to sell their tanks.

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
不会这么简单的
That won't be easy.

77
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:10,820
我收集到的情报显示
The information I've received suggests to me that the

德国人正在准备一场不同的战斗

81
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:19,941
迹象很明确
There are certain indications.

82
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,287
如果是这样 那么试着用你的
If so, try to use your

83
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,102
影响力来劝说波兰人买法国货吧
influence to persuade the Poles to buy French.

84
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,500
这场晚宴 他们把我们配成一对了
They've paired us off for this dinner,

85
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:36,527

87

如果你把感冒传染给我 
If you give it to me 

88
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:39,140
我们都可以托病不去了
we could both be excused.

89
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,500
你无法这么轻易的摆脱
You're not getting out of it that easily.

90
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,731
但是 我给你找了个人替代我  
But I've found you a substitute. 

91
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,687
Anna Skarbek

晚宴过后还有舞会

95
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,462
我会尽量不去踩到她的脚趾

我找Skarbek女士

100
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:43,941
不能算是将军  是陆军中校
Not quite a general. Lieutenant colonel.

101
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,802
在人看来也是一位勇士   
A brave one too by the look of it.   

102
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:47,529
不过是个幸运的人  我还活着
A lucky one. I'm alive.

我不怎么参加正式的晚会的

108
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,180
非常感谢您在如此短的时间内做到这一点
It's very kind of you to do this at such short notice.

109
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:19,074
Dupin夫人对每个人都那么好 
Madame Dupin does favours for everyone 

110
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,726
我怎么能拒绝呢
so how could I refuse?

111
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:23,046
早点送她回来 好么   
Don't bring her back too late, eh?  

112
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:24,262
别喝太多了
Don't drink too much.

113
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,916
你一直住在华沙吗
Have you always lived in Warsaw?

114
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,822
不 我在这里才不过一年
No, I've been here just over a year.

115
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,741
我的工作需要长久奔波
My work means I travel a lot.

116
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,181
那么你的家在哪里
So where's home?

117
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:43,901
我出生在巴黎 有波兰血统
I'm Parisian by birth, Polish by heritage.

118
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,660
所以巴黎是我们的共同点
So we have Paris in common.

119
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,980
以防我们无话可谈么?
In case we run out of conversation?

120
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,822
我确信我们不会那样的 Skarbek女士
I'm sure we won't do that, Madame Skarbek.

121
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,942
请叫我Anna小姐 总之目前这样称呼就好

125
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,740
我认为他们叫我们去用餐了
I think they want us at table.

126

很高兴跟你谈话 Blanc先生

抱歉 你是被纠缠了么
I'm sorry, were you trapped?

128
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,381
不是那样 他是一位专门研究履带的工程师
Not at all. He's an engineer specialising in treads.

129
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,381
他很迷人
Fascinating.

130
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,994
Mercier 你这家伙  
Mercier, you dog! 

131
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,178
你都把这位美丽的女士藏在哪了
Where have you been hiding this beautiful lady?

132
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,290
Anna Skarbek

134
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:36,340
答非所问
That does not answer my question.

135
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,582
我们一小时前才认识

The Virtuti Militari.

139
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,847
{\pos(192,80)}Virtuti Militari：1939年9月2日，第18波美拉尼亚枪骑兵团被该作战集群司令史坦斯洛夫・戈尔斯摩特-斯克丁尼基（Stanislaw Grzmot-Skotnicki）用他自己的波兰军事十字勋章（Virtuti Militari）授勋奖励该单位的英勇表现。

140
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,500
一个法国人是如何赢得波兰勋章的?
How did a Frenchman win a Polish medal?

141
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,860
1920年时 
He was attached 

142
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,140
他在我骑兵中队属下时候获得的
to my cavalry squadron in 1920.

143
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,980
我们一起击退了苏联红军
We fought off the Red Army together.

144
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,140
就你们两个?
Just the two of you?

145
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,860
可能还有其他人 我不记得了
There may have been others, I don't recall.

146
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,302
稍后请赏光共舞一曲吧
Promise me a dance later.

147
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,461
跳舞?
Dancing?

148
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:07,341
是的  所以我本该强烈反对那六道菜的
Yes. So I would advise against all six courses.

149
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:09,142
你是不是经常如此?
Is this something you do often?

150
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,501
不幸的是 差不多每晚都这样
Unhappily, almost every night.

151
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:16,419
我浅酌红酒 品尝食物 
I sip the wine, taste the food, 

152
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:18,421
发现每个人都这么迷人
find everyone fascinating.

153
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,060
外交的一句好格言
A good motto for diplomacy.

154
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,782
这是拯救世界的方法之一
It's one way to save the world.

155
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,261
你跳的很好 Jean-Francois
You dance well, Jean-Francois.

156
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,582
我妻子过去喜爱跳舞
My wife loved to dance.

157
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:43,622
发生了什么
What happened?

158
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,182
肺痨  三年前的事了
Consumption. Three years ago.

159
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,182
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:53,702
你一定很想念你的妻子吧
You must miss your wife.

161
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:58,102
是的  她曾让这样的夜晚不那么难熬
I do. She made these evenings tolerable.

162
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,462
现在有你
As have you.

163
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,422
这倒是意外之喜
It's been an unexpected pleasure.

164
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:12,901
我已经了解很多关于这坦克的事情了
And I've learned so much about this tank.

165
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,261
我在担心它的装备
I worry about the armament

166
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:17,900
一个37毫米加农炮和仅仅一挺机枪吗?
a 37-millimetre cannon with only one machine gun?

167
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,980
你已经跟Pakulski上校谈过话了
You've been talking to Colonel Pakulski.

168
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,700
他认为波兰买不起
He thinks it's not much of a machine for Poland's money.

169
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,844
一旦德国的坦克碾压过境 
Better than nothing if German tanks roll 

170
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,548
有军备总比赤手空拳好
across the border.

171
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:26,960
要是德国人这么做了 
But if they do, surely

172
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:29,422
英勇的法国人会施以援手么
the gallant French will rush to our rescue?

173
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,342
可否邀请您的舞伴?   - 可以
May I?  - Of course.

174
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:46,993
哦 这不是什么好主意 
Oh, not a good idea 

175
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,683
在喝过苏格兰威士忌
after Scotch,

176
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:50,181
红葡萄酒和白兰地后
claret and slivovitz.

177
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,422
根本不是什么好主意
Not a good idea at all.

178
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,420
你无所不知 Antoni
You know everything, Antoni.

179
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,302
跟她生活在一起的那个俄罗斯人是什么来历?
What's the story with this Russian she lives with?

180
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,302
Maxim Mostov 白俄罗斯人
Maxim Mostov. White Russian.

181
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:09,020
自从他离开家乡后他云游四方
He's lived in many places since he left his homeland.

182
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,453
他是一个政治记者
He makes a living as a political journalist.

183
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,780
主要攻击斯大林的
Mostly attacking Stalin.

184
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:14,982
话多 喝的更多
Talks too much and drinks even more.

185
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,367
为什么她和他在一起?   
Why is she with him?  

186
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,661
谁懂女人呢?
Who knows with women?

187
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,582
他们在一起多久了
How long have they been together?

188
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,921
够长了 你就在想这些么  
Long enough, is that what you are thinking? 

189
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:26,422
小心为妙啊 我的朋友
Careful, my friend.

190
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:37,461
已经3点半了  
It's 3.30. 

191
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,980
我答应过不能太晚带你回家的
I was told not to bring you back too late.

192
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:42,342
Max估计已经睡了  不必费心送我上楼了
Max will be asleep. Don't bother to see me upstairs.

193
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,862
还有 感谢你 这是个难忘的夜晚
And thank you for a memorable evening.

194
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,582
来杯咖啡 
Coffee, please.

195
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:15,662
给这位女士来杯巧克力
And another chocolate for Madame.

196
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,541
总是这么准时啊 上校
Always so punctual, Colonel.

197
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,382
你跟Uhl先生约会准时么
Were you on time for your rendezvous with Herr Uhl?

198
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:25,661
伯爵夫人总是姗姗来迟
For him the Countess is always late.

199
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:30,501
她有时不太随和 我相当喜欢她
She can be difficult at times. I rather like her.

200
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,021
当然 他认为她是身无分文的
Of course he thinks she's penniless.

201
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,019
他又借给她一些你的钱了  
He loaned her some more of your money. 

202
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,181
你想把钱收回来么
Do you want it back?

203
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,710
留着吧 Olga  
No keep it, Olga. 

204
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,061
我们已经按惯例为你存了款
We've made your usual deposit.

205
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,174
我们对你所做的一切感激在心
We're appreciative of what you do.

206
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,100
也许我生来就是个间谍
Perhaps I was born to be a spy.

207
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,902
我们得适应我们所处的时代
We adapt to the times we live in.

208
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,340
法国有句俗语
There's a French saying,

209
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:52,300
"神随意栽种 人自求繁荣"
"Wherever God has planted you, you must know how to flower."

210
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:55,262
这对之前的事情无疑是种促进
It's certainly an improvement on what came before.

211
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,221
你是怎么找到Uhl先生的?
How did you find Herr Uhl?

212
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:03,180
每次华沙之行都是他生命的极乐时刻
His trips to Warsaw are the high points of his life.

213
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:06,102
另外他工作在外 是个顾家的好男人
Otherwise he labours away, the good family man.

214
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,569
他下个月会再来  
He'll be back next month. 

215
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,542
尽管有些不情愿
Though he showed some reluctance.

216
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,218
哦 他会回来的  
Oh, he'll come. 

217
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:15,062
他甚至可能已经爱上伯爵夫人了
He may even be in love with the Countess.

218
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,222
我是不是演过头了
Am I overplaying my part?

219
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:04,262
我的围巾 我落车上了
My scarf, I left it.

220
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:12,502
- 该死 这些人   - 请让我进去
- Fuck these people.  - Please!

221
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:14,742
没到时候
Not yet.

222
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,582
就现在
Now.

223
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:26,821
他们在外面还有巡逻
They still have patrols out there.

224
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,901
下一轮巡逻过来是在9点25分
The next one comes through at 9.35.

225
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:33,181
他们总是那么准时么?   - 分毫不差
They're always prompt?  - Like a clock.

226
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:35,390
- 带着狗?   - 一直是  
- Dogs?  - Always. 

227
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,061
你确定要这么做 中校?
Sure you want to do this, Colonel?

228
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:41,341
要是他们看到你 会当场开枪的
If they see you they'll shoot on sight.

229
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,502
如果我们不出来 在车上动点手脚就没事
If we don't show up, do something with the car.

230
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,742
还好吧?   - 我没事
All right?  - I'm OK.

231
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:44,142
这是什么
What is it?

232
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:47,222
是一个坦克的陷阱
It's a tank trap.

233
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,383
为什么他们要覆盖他们的坦克陷阱?  
Why are they covering their tank traps? 

234
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:53,423
这没道理啊
That doesn't make sense.

235
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,342
往光源处打
Go for the light.

236
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,742
走 走 快走 快 快!
Go, go, go, go, go!

237
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:17,061
我昨晚在找你
I looked for you last night.

238
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:19,860
你是不是忘记了王子和我要举办一个晚会?
Did you forget the Prince and I were holding a soiree?

239
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,403
昨晚实难抽身 公主  
It was impossible to get away, Princess. 

240
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:23,582
文书工作堆积如山
Paperwork. Reams of it.

241
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:28,102
嗯 这又是什么 纸划伤的?
Hmm, and what's this, a paper cut?

242
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,101
我读了你的报告
I read your report.

243
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,900
- 看上去真是千钧一发   - 我很幸运
- A near miss by the sound of it.  - I was fortunate.

244
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:41,633
如果被抓了呢  要是你射到某人了呢?
What if you were caught? Or you'd shot someone?

245
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,066
天哪 那我们要如何解释?   
Christ, how would we explain that?  

246
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,220
我并没有那样做 也没有人那么做
I wasn't. And no-one was.

247
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,780
巴黎将会持怀疑态度的
Paris will take a dim view of this.

248
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,022
你做什么 你想试着证明什么
What are you, what are you trying to prove?

249
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,381
我想我已经解释明白了
I thought I made that clear.

250
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,927
他们覆盖了陷阱 
They're covering traps 

251
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,620
这样他们自己的坦克便不会受到阻碍
so their own tanks won't be impeded.

252
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,212
你的意思是如果他们入侵   
If they invade, you mean. 

253
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,260
希特勒铁了心要发动战争
Hitler is intent on war,

254
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:57,419
唯一的问题是
it's only a question of 

255
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,942
他会先攻打谁
who he picks a fight with first.

256
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,782
亲爱的中校  日子过的如何
Dear Colonel! How has life been treating you?

257
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:10,821
非常好 Rozen女士  你们二位呢
Very well, Madame Rozen. And yourselves?

258
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,102
本应更好些 但是我们没法抱怨什么
Could be better, but we can't complain.

259
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:19,622
他是你的朋友么
Is he a friend of yours?

260
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:23,501
不算是  一个同胞 但是是个流亡者
Not exactly. A compatriot, but an emigre.

261
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,867
一些人放弃了我们 是多么的悲哀啊  
Sad how some people abandon us. 

262
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:26,902
一部分是最聪明的人啊
Some of the brightest.

263
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:30,621
不是每个人都想建设社会主义的 亲爱的
Not everyone wants to build socialism, my love.

264
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,138
嗯 在我们的家乡
Well, it isn't an easy life,

265
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,142
生活着实不易 为什么不承认呢
where we come from, why not admit it?

266
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:35,566
但是 中校 
But, Colonel, 

267
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:38,074
比起我们之前的生活好多了
better than what we had before.

268
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:38,826
失陪了
Excuse me.

269
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:50,381
Anna
Anna.

270
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,182
我知道你觉得这类场合很无聊
I know you find these occasions boring

271
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:54,941
但是 我已经开始乐在其中了
but I'm beginning to enjoy them.

272
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,340
或者是享受香槟?
Or is it the champagne?

273
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,582
香槟确实有帮助
The champagne helps.

274
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:00,893
所以你认识Rozen夫妇   
So you know the Rozens. 

275
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,662
每个人都知道他们
Everyone knows them.

276
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,821
他们试图拉拢你吗
Do they try to recruit you?

277
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,397
Max说俄罗斯大使馆的
Max says everyone at the

278
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:08,220
每一个人都是间谍 即使看门人也是
Russian Embassy is a spy, even the janitor.

279
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,980
嗯 Malka时常想给我煮些罗宋汤
Well, Malka offers to cook me borscht from time to time.

280
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:14,702
他们当然鄙视Max 因为他的文章
They despise Max of course, because of what he writes.

281
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:19,101
距离俄罗斯进行试验时日不多了...
It's not so far from the Russian experiment...

282
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:21,112
我最好把他带回家  
I'd better get him home. 

283
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:22,822
他让美国大使走投无路了
He's cornered the American Ambassador.

284
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:27,854
你们这些美国人听到"社会主义" 
You Americans go weak at the knees 

285
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:28,540
腿都软了
when you hear the word "Socialism"

286
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,262
你还能叫它什么
But what else can you call it?

287
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:47,181
为什么她和这个俄罗斯人在一起
Why is she with this Russian?

288
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,549
你讨厌俄罗斯人就跟
You hate Russians 

289
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:49,742
讨厌德国人一样吧 Marek?
as much as Germans, Marek?

290
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,862
别无选择  一个在东边 一个在西边
Nothing to choose. One to the east, one to the west.

291
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,342
两边都希望像敲核桃一样侵入波兰
Both waiting to crush Poland like a walnut.

292
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,519
你想去哪儿 头儿?  
You wish to go on somewhere, boss? 

293
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,782
餐馆还是夜总会?
Restaurant? Nightclub?

294
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:09,222
不 我想回家 把这该死的领结脱下来
No, I want to go home and get this bloody collar off.

295
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,002
伯爵夫人 自从你向我介绍
Countess, since you introduced

296
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:47,022
那个法国人 我的生命就发生了改变
me to the Frenchman, my life has changed.

297
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:52,181
当然 这使得我们关系更加密切 
It has brought us closer, of course,

298
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:54,574
但是 我陷入了一个
but, I am caught up in a

299
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:59,061
危险的游戏 这是个危险的时代
dangerous game and these are dangerous times.

300
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:00,348
你不希望再见到我了么   
You don't wish to see me again?  

301
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,022
哦 不 当然不是喽
Oh, no, of course I do.

302
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,022
你知道我对你的感情
You know how I feel about you.

303
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,302
但是也许我们不得不考虑一下我们的将来
But perhaps we have to think of our future.

304
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:11,422
在一起么?
Together?

305
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:13,982
为什么不呢
Why not?

306
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,982
Edvard 我已经逃离了故土
Edvard, I have already fled the country of my birth.

307
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:22,422
我已经不知道哪里会安全了
I don't know where is safe any more.

308
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:29,142
和我在一起就安全了
Safe would be with me.

309
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:52,822
都在这了
Here it is.

310
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,742
最后的设计图应该在下个月就会完成
The final blueprints should be complete by next month.

311
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:05,221
那么我们下次就到那时候见
Then that's when we'll meet next.

312
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:07,101
啊 这恐怕很难
Ah, that's difficult.

313
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,395
8号我和其他两名工程师
On the eighth me and two other engineers,

314
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:12,398
我们必须去施兰贝格的黑森林   
we have to go to Schramberg in the Black Forest.  

315
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:12,169
{\pos(192,26)}施兰贝格：德国巴登-符腾堡州的一个市镇

316
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,257
去干什么
What for?

317
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,500
去观察坦克演习
To observe tank exercises.

318
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,422
我们被要求提供建议
We're being asked for our recommendations.

319
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:18,581
演习?  你指的是军事演习?
Exercises? You mean manoeuvres?

320
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,189
军事演戏 是的 我是这么猜想的
Manoeuvres, yes, I suppose so.

321
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:23,314
坦克不会进森林的吧 Uhl先生  
Tanks don't go in forests, Herr Uhl. 

322
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:25,232
森林里有树
There are trees in forests.

323
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,531
我不是军人  
I'm not a military man. 

324
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:30,462
我怎么知道他们在做些什么?
How would I know what they're up to?

325
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:34,862
我们一周后见
Let's meet a week later.

326
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:40,381
我会的  但是从此我们交易结束
I will do that. But then it ends.

327
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,845
上次 盖世太保在边界上  
Last time, the Gestapo were at the border. 

328
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:43,961
我不得不躲开他们
I had to elude them,

329
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:44,756
从铁轨上爬下来 
scramble down the tracks 

330
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:45,740
然后乘出租车去下一站
and take a taxi to the next station.

331
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,060
你在怕什么
What were you frightened of?

332
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,780
如果他们问我 我在华沙做什么
What if they asked me what I was doing in Warsaw?!

333
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,620
告诉他们你去和一位女士幽会
Tell them you were seeing a lady.

334
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,182
通奸还不算犯罪
Adultery is not yet a crime.

335
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:16,541
Uhl先生?
Herr Uhl?

336
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,582
是的?
Yes?

337
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:21,021
我是Renata  伯爵夫人的侄女
I'm Renata. The Countess's niece.

338
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:24,982
她想让我在你去车站前找到你
She wanted me to catch you before you went to the station.

339
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:27,381
她是不是身体不太好   - 不 不 不
Is she unwell?  - No, no, no.

340
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:30,102
她说有重要的事要告诉你
She says it's important that she tells you something

341
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,062
在你上火车前
before you catch your train.

342
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:13,821
- 那女孩是谁   - 什么女孩
- Who is the girl? - What girl?

343
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,180
见过你线人的金发女郎   
The blonde who met your man. 

344
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,009
他跟她走了
He went off with her.

345
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,582
不好责怪他 她长的很漂亮
Hard to blame him, she was very pretty.

346
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,021
她是妓女么
Was she a prostitute?

347
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:22,702
为什么在他跟他的伯爵夫人共度春宵后
Why would he want a tart 

348
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,182
还想要一个妓女?
after a night with his Countess?

349
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:26,782
他们朝哪个方向去了?
Which way did they go?

350
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,701
朝Muranow区
Towards Muranow.

351
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:29,862
我们去跟着他们
Let's get after them.

352
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,982
伯爵夫人住这儿?
The Countess lives here?

353
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,996
她告诉我没有你的帮助
She tells me without your help 

354
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,342
事情会变得更糟糕
it would be somewhere worse.

355
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,742
我觉得不妙  有些不对劲
I don't like this. Something isn't right.

356
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:40,862
发生了什么
What's going on?

357
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:42,341
这个人病了
The man is sick.

358
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,182
他没病 他被麻醉了
He's not sick, he's drugged.

359
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:16,501
是三氯甲烷
It's chloroform.

360
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:17,861
他死了么
Is he dead?

361
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:18,981
还有脉搏
There's a pulse.

362
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:20,662
很微弱 但是还有
It's faint, but it's there.

363
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:26,180
公共场合的绑架 街头斗殴
An abduction in public, brawling in the streets!

364
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,220
难道我们希望早报上出现这些么?
Are we to look forward to this in the morning papers?

365
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,667
不 Jourdain 
No, Jourdain, 

366
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,782
我来打几个电话掩盖掉这件事
I made some calls and put the lid on it.

367
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,101
这个人是谁
Who was this man?

368
00:31:32,102 --> 00:31:33,221
一个线人
A contact.

369
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:35,341
你是说他是间谍 他还活着么?
You mean a spy. Will he live?

370
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,340
是的 但是他不能回德国了
Yes, but he can't go back to Germany.

371
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:38,298
我会向他保证
I'd like to assure him

372
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,302
我们能帮助他重新安置下来
that we can help with some kind of relocation.

373
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,661
基于什么理由
On what grounds?

374
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:42,982
他应得的
He's earned it.

375
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:45,740
并且我打算继续调查他告诉我的事儿
And I intend to follow up on what he told me.

376
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,405
记住 中校 
Try to remember, Colonel, 

377
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,980
你在这里的职责是机密
that your function here is covert,

378
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:50,942
我们希望你办事
which means we want to hear as little as possible

379
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,701
越低调越好
about what you get up to.

380
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,982
你看起来可不怎么样 你还好吧
You don't look well. Are you all right?

381
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,621
有点头痛
A slight headache.

382
00:31:57,622 --> 00:32:00,542
嗯 我觉得你是在装样子
Well, I presume you're in some sort of disguise.

383
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,742
如果没有 那么我就把我裁缝的名字告诉你
If not, let me get you the name of my tailor.

384
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:11,340
我一直向往南非  
I was hoping for South Africa. 

385
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,981
我已经申请了签证
I already applied for a visa.

386
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:14,901
这可不明智
That was unwise.

387
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:17,180
一旦被盖世太保发现
If the Gestapo found out, that might explain why

388
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,982
他们逮捕你时就有了个好理由
they tried to snatch you when they did.

389
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,649
但你能把我带到那  是吧  
But you can get me there? Yes? 

390
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,261
一个全新的生活
A new life?

391
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:26,301
不  德国特工会等着你的
No. German agents will be waiting for you.

392
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:28,262
你得去法国的某处
It has to be somewhere French.

393
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,101
或许是加拿大
Canada perhaps.

394
00:32:30,102 --> 00:32:32,221
加拿大
Canada?

395
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:36,022
伯爵夫人有可能在那儿与我碰头吗
Would it be possible for the Countess to join me there?

396
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:40,421
Uhl先生
Herr Uhl...

397
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:43,221
她不是伯爵夫人
she's not a Countess.

398
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,262
她也不曾爱过你
Nor was she ever in love with you.

399
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,061
他清醒了 是不
He's awake, then?

400
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,740
认清了他生活的事实
Awake to the facts of life.

401
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,055
官方报道 他死于因窒息
Officially, he died of cardiac arrest,

402
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:00,700
引起的心脏骤停
brought on by asphyxiation.

403
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,982
这样应该可以摆脱德国方面的追踪
That should throw the Germans off the trail.

404
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,062
十分感谢
Thank you.

405
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,700
你注意过这儿的护士有多年轻么
Have you noticed how young these nurses are?

406
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:10,740
或者只是说我们在渐渐老去
Or is it just that we're getting older?

407
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,062
恐怕是吧 Antoni
I'm afraid so, Antoni.

408
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:30,782
{\pos(191,280)}我刚收到了一封来自华沙的电报

409
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,701
{\pos(191,280)}Uhl死了

410
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:36,701
{\pos(191,280)}你不仅搞砸了他的绑架

411
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:40,800
{\pos(191,280)}你该死的还杀了他

412
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,981
{\pos(191,280)}白痴!

413
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:43,257
{\pos(191,280)}我简直不能相信 

414
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,702
{\pos(191,280)}Sturmbannfuehrer先生

415
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:46,821
{\pos(191,280)}去看看他的遗孀

416
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,002
{\pos(191,280)}以表我们的慰问和哀思?

417
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,621
{\pos(191,280)}不 你这蠢货

418
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,000
{\pos(191,280)}去把房子搜个底朝天

419
00:33:55,582 --> 00:33:58,000
{\pos(191,280)}你在藏什么呢 Zoller

420
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,999
{\pos(191,280)}难不成你是犹太人

421
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,422
一些拼图被弄丢了
Some pieces are missing.

422
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:14,982
我找不到这块 哪儿都找不到
I can't find this one, I can't find it anywhere.

423
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,662
你睡眠好点儿了吗
Are you sleeping better?

424
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:21,821
并不怎么样
Not really.

425
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:26,021
他们待我并不是很好 你知道的
They don't treat me very well here, you know.

426
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,935
那些年轻人似乎忘记了
The younger ones seem to forget that 

427
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,020
这儿曾经是我的房子
this was my house once.

428
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,502
如果我能的话 他们估计全都要被解雇了
And if it was, I'd dismiss most of them.

429
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,701
华沙怎么样
How's Warsaw?

430
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:38,221
阴冷潮湿
Cold and wet.

431
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:40,901
遇到了真命天子么?
Is there a man in your life?

432
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:42,941
我给你说过Max
I've told you about Max.

433
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:45,701
噢 他还蒙受你青眼?
Oh, he's still in the picture?

434
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,461
是啊 母亲
Yes, Mother.

435
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,512
嗯 我搞不懂你为什么
Well, I wonder why 

436
00:34:49,512 --> 00:34:50,780
从来不带他来见我
it is you've never brought him here to see me.

437
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:52,622
因为你不喜欢俄罗斯人
Because you don't like Russians.

438
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,862
呃 这是事实  还有德国人
Well, that's true. Or Germans.

439
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:58,136
如果我们还呆在巴黎的话 
If we'd stayed in Paris, 

440
00:34:58,136 --> 00:34:59,662
现在你已经和某个法国人结婚了
you'd be married to a Frenchman by now.

441
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:03,701
我最近见着了一个
I met one recently.

442
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,821
他似乎被我迷住了
He seemed quite taken with me.

443
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,381
他有土地么
Does he have land?

444
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:09,581
不清楚
I've no idea.

445
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:10,703
嗯 他们经常装作
Well, they often pretend

446
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:12,900
自己封邑无数 等到最后却是一贫如洗
they do and then they turn out to be penniless.

447
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,702
我是说 你的俄罗斯小伙没有钱
I mean, your Russian doesn't have money.

448
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:23,142
我需要一块带些绿色的蓝天拼图
I need a piece of blue sky with a little bit of green.

449
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,220
德国人在试图抓捕Uhl先生
The Germans tried to snatch Herr Uhl.

450
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:39,022
也许是盖世太保在盯着他
It could be the Gestapo is onto him.

451
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:41,061
他们可能已经知道你了
They may know about you.

452
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,793
如果他们知道 他们会去寻找
If so, they'll be looking

453
00:35:42,794 --> 00:35:44,740
Potocki伯爵夫人 
for the Countess Potocki, 

454
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,702
而不是Olga Musser
not Olga Musser.

455
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:48,261
即便如此 我们也要做到未雨绸缪
Even so, we should take precautions.

456
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:49,901
于是派来一个保镖

高挑英俊又对某一年龄段的女性

458
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:52,862
情有独钟

459
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:55,221
Olga 请认真对待这事
Olga, please treat this seriously.

460
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:58,102
收拾收拾东西 搬去这家旅店里住几天
Take some things, move to this hotel for a few days.

461
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,681
就在Sienna大街 
It's on Sienna Street, 

462
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:02,500
离Cleo咖啡厅不远
not far from the Cafe Cleo.

463
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:04,822
预约时我用了你的真实姓名
The reservation's under your real name.

464
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:07,542
那么不再是伯爵夫人了

465
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:10,382
我会怀念她的

466
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,234
我最近没有见到你 Lapp博士

467
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:25,822

柏林 出席我公司的销售会议

温莎公爵和夫人去拜访了希特勒先生

微笑 握手 再挥手

472
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:40,380
英国人也被他蛊惑了不成
Are the English falling under his spell too?

473
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,462
你不赞同现政权

474
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:46,541
古老欧洲的文化 礼仪 稳定

对德国来说可不是个坏事

476
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:52,261
我们德国人也许并不像你想的
Some of us Germans may not be

477
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:55,302
那样像法国的敌人
so much the enemy of France as you might think.

478
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,220
抱歉 您刚才说什么
Sorry, you were saying?

479
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,316
没关系  
Don't worry. 

480
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,622
美丽的女士同样总会吸引我的目光

481
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,301
你认识她

482
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:09,220
我们最近见过一面  我 我应该向她问声好

不  Max正在忙着赶文章

487
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,540
我来这儿是为了避雨

488

492
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:37,781
我需要一些欢笑
I needed a laugh.

493
00:37:37,782 --> 00:37:39,222
你为什么不开心
What made you sad?

494
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,301
我母亲的情况不是很好
My mother is unwell.

495
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,862
自我父亲去世起她就没有好起来过了

496
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:48,421
她怀念过去的奢华时光

497
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:50,862
她接受不了自己有一个工作的女儿
She can't believe she has a daughter who works.

498
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:53,461
所以你的童年生活优越?

499
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:55,142
和你比就不算什么了
Not compared to you.

500
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:59,382
这戒指难道不代表着你是一位贵族
Doesn't this ring mean you're nobility?

501
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:01,341
噢 只是个卑微的骑士罢了
Oh, just a lowly chevalier.

502
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:04,177
效忠于国王的骑士 
A knight in service to the king - 

503
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:05,102
在法国还有国王的时候
when France had a king.

504
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:07,861
不过  仍是我唯一认识的贵族

你一直在检查我

506
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:17,902
是的 我回来了 亲爱的们

这些信件 大多都是账单

全是寄给Olga Musser的

509
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:41,902
那么是谁出主意让你变成一个伯爵夫人
So whose idea was it to make you a Countess?

510
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:52,582
我简直不能相信现在有多晚了
I can't believe how late it is.

511
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:56,182
Max会伤心吗
Will Max be upset?

512
00:38:58,428 --> 00:38:59,876
如果知道你带我去了个那么棒的餐厅
He might be upset that 

513
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,862
他一定会沮丧的
you took me to such a fine restaurant

514
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:05,701
并且你还点了那么好的红酒
and that you ordered some very good wine.

515
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:08,542
人生得意须尽欢 莫使金樽空对月
Life's too short to drink bad wine.

516
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,821
谢谢了
Thank you.

517
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:15,702
谢谢你让我重拾笑容

什么时候我才能再见到你
When can I see you again?

519
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:26,582
也许不如不见的好
Maybe it's better if we don't.

520
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,062
我认为 欢愉不过再相逢
I think it might be better if we do.

521
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,822
晚安 Jean-Francois
Good night, Jean-Francois.

522
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:19,861
写完了么
Did you finish it?

523
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:21,582
没什么价值
For what it's worth.

524
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:25,781
都是些废话  我没机会再写
Chit-chat. I don't have the

525
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:28,580
正儿八经的东西了
chance to write anything serious any more.

526
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:30,982
就算我可以 我还有什么好写的呢
And if I did, would I have anything to say?

527
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:35,589
你是一个很棒的作家 Max  
You're a brilliant writer, Max. 

528
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:37,741
只是要静候良机
Just bide your time.

529
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:40,341
也许我应该去趟英格兰
Maybe I should go to England.

530
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:43,261
他们可能会在公园里给我一个街头演说台
They might give me a soapbox in the park.

531
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:46,208
每逢周六我就可以愤怒地反对斯大林  
On Saturdays, I can rage against Stalin. 

532
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,022
到了周日是希特勒
On Sundays, Hitler.

533
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:53,622
谁送你回家的  我在窗户外见着你了
Who brought you home? I saw you from the window.

534
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:56,621
Mercier中校
Colonel Mercier.

535
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:00,262
我该嫉妒这个中校么
Should I be jealous of the Colonel?

536
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:06,182
去睡觉 你这老家伙  我给你弄些热牛奶
Get to bed, you old bear. I'll bring you some hot milk.

537
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:26,261
谁发现的她
Who found her?

538
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:27,701
一个邻居
A neighbour.

539
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,660
她有好几天没看见她了
She hadn't seen her for a couple of days,

540
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,582
猫也吵吵闹闹的
and the cat was making a racket.

541
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,781
她怎么死的
How did she die?

542
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,822
被勒死的
Strangled.

543
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:40,940
为什么警方让你来处理
Why did the police bring you into this?

544
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,659
另一个邻居听到有人离开的声音
Another neighbour heard men

545
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,460
并且认为他们讲的是德语
leaving and thought they were German voices.

546
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,060
这样一来就是一场国内安全事故
That makes this an internal security matter.

547
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:50,300
我知道她是你的线人之一 
I know she was one of your contacts, 

548
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,000
Jean-Francois

549
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,102
这就是我找你的原因
That's why I called you.

550
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:55,502
死的可真惨
What a horrible way to die.

551
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:04,102
可怜的Olga
Poor bloody Olga.

552
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,582
她被折磨过么
Was she tortured?

553
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:11,838
我猜她很快就交待了
I imagine she told them 

554
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:13,182
他们想知道的一切
what they wanted to know fairly quickly.

555
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:17,582
这是我们工作的可怕一面 Antoni
This is the terrible part of what we do, Antoni.

556
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:21,577
雇佣某人 获取他们信任 任用他们 
Recruit someone, gain their trust, use them, 

557
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:22,680
然后在某一天
and then one day...

558
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,955
我们仅仅是战士的时候就简单多了   
It was easier when we were simply soldiers. 

559
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:26,690
嗯
Hmm.

560
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,061
黑就是黑 白就是白  没有灰色地带
Black and white. Now everything is grey.

561
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:32,022
阴影  秘密
Shadows. Secrets.

562
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:37,781
你有我的资料吗
Do you have a file on me?

563
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:40,142
有一小份  你肯定有更多我的资料
A thin one. I'm sure you have more on me.

564
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:44,981
我不揣冒昧地假设是Marek报告给你的
I presume Marek reports to you.

565
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,941
他是你身后的好人
He's a good man to have at your back.

566
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:50,062
现在你陷入险境了
You're in danger yourself now.

567
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,772
我想巴黎已经为你这次的德国行动
I think Paris has sent everything for your 

568
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:04,522
准备好了一切
jaunt into Germany.

569
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,260
地图 天气预报  
Maps, weather reports. 

570
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,621
噢 你之前用过这其中任何一样么
Oh, have you used one of these before?

571
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:11,781
没有
No.

572
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:14,662
换装的地点就在这儿的某处
The directions for reloading are somewhere here.

573
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:19,531
相机里有一个胶卷 背包里还有十个
There's a film in the camera and ten more in the knapsack.

574
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,391
你将会在巴塞尔得到一辆车 
You'll pick up a car in Basel 

575
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,221
然后开着它越过边境
and drive over the border.

576
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:25,302
你是Albert Ducasse 
You're Albert Ducasse, 

577
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,401
{\pos(192,26)}瑞士一城市

578
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,401
来自洛桑市
from Lausanne.

579
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,220
巴黎方面希望你在这儿留下自己的护照
Paris wants you to leave your own passport here.

580
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,948
别被抓住 因为
Do try not to be caught, because,

581
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,780
从技术层面上说 你是一名间谍
technically speaking, you're a spy.

582
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,862
在这种情况下会遭枪杀的
And in that situation could be shot.

583
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,382
您此行的目的是什么 Ducasse先生
What is the purpose of your visit, Herr Ducasse?

584
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:58,902
去弗莱堡参加一场婚礼
A wedding in Freiburg.

585
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,702
{\pos(191,280)}起来

586
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,502
{\pos(191,280)}起来 

587
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:17,702
{\pos(191,280)}我只是一个鸟类学家

588
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:25,541
{\pos(191,280)}到这儿来

589
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,141
{\pos(191,280)}带上你的相机

590
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:28,821
{\pos(191,280)}过来

591
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
{\pos(191,280)}往前走

592
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:31,502
{\pos(191,280)}往前走

593
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:56,397
这一幕明确地显示了
The post made the motorcycle 

594
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:58,062
摩托车确实和坦克一样宽
exactly the same width as a tank.

595
00:47:58,063 --> 00:48:00,421
我看见他们测量了
I watched them measure it.

596
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,089
这个军官在试着证实他们
The officer was trying to prove that 

597
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,325
如果坦克有办法穿过树林
if that could find a way

598
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:05,742
那么一个装甲师也可以
through the trees, then so could a Panzer division.

599
00:48:17,782 --> 00:48:18,980
你被发现了
You were discovered?

600
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,102
很遗憾  但我把他处理了
Regrettably. I took care of him.

601
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:23,341
你杀了他
You killed him?

602
00:48:23,342 --> 00:48:25,540
他还不到18岁
He was no more than 18 years old.

603
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,620
我堵了他的嘴 用步枪背带把他绑了起来
I gagged him and tied him up with his rifle strap.

604
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:30,262
你变得优柔寡断了 Mercier
You're getting soft, Mercier.

605
00:48:30,263 --> 00:48:33,180
我们并不在战场上 Lessard上校  
We're not at war, Colonel Lessard. 

606
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,110
现在还没有
Not yet.

607
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,813
你上份报告提到了
Your previous report 

608
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:42,901
波兰边境的坦克陷阱
concerned tank traps on the Polish border.

609
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:45,941
就像你已经注意到的 被填平了 
Which as you may have noticed, is flat.

610
00:48:45,984 --> 00:48:47,251
波兰大草原是为坦克入侵
Polish steppes are 

611
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:48,860
而量身定做的完美战场
tailor-made for tank invasion.

612
00:48:48,861 --> 00:48:51,420
所以他们为什么要在一个森林里进行军演
So why are they holding manoeuvres in a forest?

613
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:54,420
也许波兰并不是他们的唯一目标
Possibly Poland is not their sole objective.

614
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:55,780
你认为他们会入侵我们?
You think they'll invade us?

615
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:57,540
他们可能会从比利时横穿阿登高地
They could come through the Ardennes from Belgium.

616
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,246
他们会撞进马其诺防线 
They'd run into the Maginot Line forts - 

617
00:48:59,246 --> 00:48:59,780
那无异于是自杀
it would be suicide.

618
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,017
我认为那就是他们需要在
I believe that's what they were 

619
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:02,460
在施兰贝格进行完善的东西
trying to refine in Schramberg.

620
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,182
什么风把你吹来了
What information took you there?

621
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:05,821
我的线人 Uhl先生
My contact, Herr Uhl.

622
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:07,116
噢 是的 
Oh, yes, 

623
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:09,860
那个我们得花点代价负责重新安置的人
the man we're now obliged to relocate, at some expense.

624
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,742
当然 活在魁北克可比
Of course, living in Quebec is somewhat preferable

625
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:16,662
死在华沙好多了 就像你的女特工一样
to being dead in Warsaw, the fate of your woman agent.

626
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,129
你其他一些试图越过边境的
Your other little foray over the border 

627
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:22,374
小尝试都以枪声结束了
ended in gunshots.

628
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:25,464
也许披风和匕首并不是你的强项 
Perhaps cloak and dagger isn't your strong suit, 

629
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:25,987
Mercier
Mercier.

630
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:27,821
你愿意接受一项新任务么
Would you prefer a new assignment?

631
00:49:27,822 --> 00:49:31,182
不 上校  我选择留在波兰
No, Colonel. My preference is to remain in Poland.

632
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,542
这由Beauvilliers将军决定
That is up to General Beauvilliers.

633
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,422
他想与你共进午餐
He wants to have lunch with you.

634
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:51,181
噢 别担心Lessard
Oh, don't worry about Lessard.

635
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:52,861
我要你人在华沙
I want you in Warsaw

636
00:49:52,862 --> 00:49:55,182
安抚波兰民心 告诉他们如果最糟的情况发生
to reassure the Poles that we'll come to their aid

637
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:56,781
我们会出手援助
if the worst happens.

638
00:49:56,782 --> 00:49:58,862
你确定政客们会履行条约么
Are you sure the politicians will honour the treaties?

639
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,221
不
No...

640
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:03,461
看上帝的份上 别告诉他们
but for God's sake, don't tell them that.

641
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:07,543
达拉第还有那个英国白痴张伯伦都很乐意
Daladier and that English moron Chamberlain are keen

642
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:07,956
{\pos(192,26)}英法绥靖政策执行者

643
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:09,067
与希特勒达成协议
to strike a deal with Hitler.

644
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:09,916
对于他们而言 
To them, 

645
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:12,382
捷克人和波兰人完全是可有可无的
the Czechs and the Poles are entirely dispensable.

646
00:50:15,143 --> 00:50:17,016
这是Anglea Hope女士 
That's Lady Angela Hope, 

647
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:18,581
巴黎社交界的支柱
a pillar of Parisian society.

648
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,501
将军  一切可合您口味
General! Everything to your satisfaction?

649
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,060
这些牡蛎和平时一样美味 先生
The oysters were excellent as usual, Papa.

650
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:27,622
能为您提供喜爱的食物是我们的荣幸
So glad we could offer your favourite table.

651
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,781
就要上酸菜了
The choucroute is on its way.

652
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:31,702
配着两杯你最好的比尔森啤酒
With two glasses of your best Pilsner.

653
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,981
为何这桌如此特别
Why is this table so special?

654
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:38,940
一名保加利亚的服务总管在这里被暗杀了
A Bulgarian head waiter was assassinated here.

655
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:40,660
子弹横飞
Bullets all over the place.

656
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:43,662
所有的镜子都是重装的 除了这个
All the mirrors were replaced except this one.

657
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:46,621
真是不错的故事
It's a good story.

658
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:49,062
个人而言 我就是为这点谣传来的
Personally, I come here for the gossip.

659
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,141
所以
So...

660
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:55,741
波兰
Poland.

661
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:57,980
他们倾尽所能地去购置武器
They're doing their best to buy weapons,

662
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:00,060
同时遭受着经济危机的凌虐
though the Depression crippled their economy.

663
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:02,420
并且德军也在制造坦克
And the Germans are building tanks...

664
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:05,862
越来越多的坦克 并且正在调试已有的那些
and more tanks and modifying the ones they've got.

665
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:07,342
入侵计划
Invasion plans.

666
00:51:08,742 --> 00:51:11,781
在这灰色事务中闪着不少宝石
There are many gems in this murky business,

667
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:14,781
各种祖母绿和红宝石
all sorts of emeralds and rubies.

668
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,979
发现这些计划 
But find those plans, 

669
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,181
你就可以得到皇冠上的明珠
and you have the jewel in the crown.

670
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:23,021
并且他们只来自一座矿藏 将军 IN6
And they come from only one mine, General IN6.

671
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:25,622
德国总参谋部的策划组
The planning section of the German General Staff.

672
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,741
难以置信 你会这么说么
Impossible, would you say?

673
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:31,382
也许不是  只是在正确的时间遇上对的人
Perhaps not. The right person, the right moment.

674
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,262
Lapp博士这个名字对你来说意味着什么吗
Does the name Dr Lapp mean anything to you?

675
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:36,901
不  他是谁
No. Who is he?

676
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:39,420
他声称代表一家德国制药公司
He claims to represent a German pharmaceutical company,

677
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:41,462
但我怀疑他连一片药都没卖过
but I doubt he's ever sold a pill.

678
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:45,501
他发表评论
He makes remarks.

679
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,981
做暗示
Hints.

680
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:49,702
仿佛他想做的比小叙一会儿要深入的多
As if he wants to make more than small talk.

681
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:51,782
我会替你留意他的
I'll check him for you.

682
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:58,141
噢 是的 这看起来很不错
Oh, yes, this looks excellent.

683
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:00,360
我十分确定我们应该这么做   
I definitely think we should do that. 

684
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,203
开放参观
Open house.

685
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:02,541
- 就快了   - 当然
- Quite soon. - Absolutely.

686
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:04,621
下午好
Good afternoon.

687
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,421
Aranud 这位怡人的男士是谁

688

Mercier中校 
Colonel Mercier, 

689
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,422
Angela Hope女士
Lady Angela Hope.

690
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:13,501
Roddy Fitzware
Roddy Fitzware.

691
00:52:13,502 --> 00:52:15,260
你不能待在巴黎 中校
You can't live in Paris, Colonel,

692
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,780
不然我要将与你见面当做我的工作了
or I'd have made it my business to meet you.

693
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:19,260
我受宠若惊 但是目前 我住在华沙
I'm flattered, but at present, I live in Warsaw.

694
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,860
噢  那听起来阴郁又寒冷
Oh? That sounds cold and dull.

695
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,780
嗯 今晚的派对可能会令你精神大振的
Well, a party this evening might lift your spirits.

696
00:52:22,781 --> 00:52:24,620
一位新人艺术家的个人展出
An exhibition of a new artist.

697
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,100
他是一个顽童
He's something of an enfant terrible,

698
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:28,792
所以今晚必定会以
so the evening is bound to end in 

699
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,260
酗酒和暴力为结束
drunkenness and violence.

700
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,380
这很诱人 但我今晚要赶火车
It's tempting, but I'm on a train tonight.

701
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:34,820
我要到乡下去和我的姐姐过圣诞节
I'm spending Christmas with my sister in the country.

702
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,901
噢  真遗憾  
Oh? What a pity. 

703
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:37,902
那么我希望我们明年可以再见
Then I hope we meet again next year.

704
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:39,582
荣幸之至
A pleasure.

705
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,862
毋须天才的头脑便
It doesn't take a genius to guess 

706
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:58,182
可猜测希特勒先生的意图
Herr Hitler's intentions.

707
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:01,981
知道他最爱说的一句话么
Know his favourite saying?

708
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:04,781
世界希望被欺骗 
"The world wants to be deceived, 

709
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,982
因此让它被欺骗吧
therefore let it be deceived."

710
00:53:09,062 --> 00:53:12,782
并且他没错  读读报纸吧
And he's not wrong. Just read the newspapers.

711
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,582
你有注意听我说的话么
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

712
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:20,422
这些话我都听过了 Max
I've heard it all before, Max.

713
00:53:20,423 --> 00:53:22,782
老天啊 这可是圣诞节
For God's sake, it's Christmas.

714
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:34,022
啊 见着你可真好  还有你 你看上去不错
Ah, good to see you. And you, you look very well.

715
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:49,621
你的假期怎么样 中校
How was your holiday, Colonel?

716
00:53:49,622 --> 00:53:51,581
非常愉快
Very pleasant.

717
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:53,982
我和我姐姐待在乡下和巴黎城里
I was with my sister in the country and also Paris.

718
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:55,941
真羡慕你在巴黎
I envy you Paris.

719
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,542
贵国那边事态如何
How are things in the motherland?

720
00:53:57,543 --> 00:53:59,701
目前尚艰难
Difficult at present.

721
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:01,221
那些试验
The trials.

722
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:03,542
我们被召回了
We have been recalled.

723
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:06,941
也许是升职吧
Promotion, perhaps?

724
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:08,581
更像是一发子弹
More likely a bullet.

725
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:12,421
斯大林在清除所有的老布尔什维克党
Stalin is purging all the old Bolsheviks.

726
00:54:12,422 --> 00:54:13,741
你能帮助我们吗
Can you help us?

727
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:16,901
我们喜欢你 你知道的 中校
We like you, as you know, Colonel.

728
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,781
但我们总觉得
But we always felt...

729
00:54:18,782 --> 00:54:22,501
你在这儿的职责比
that your function here was more...

730
00:54:22,502 --> 00:54:24,981
外交更秘密
clandestine than diplomatic.

731
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:28,300
并且我们理解你期望着能有所回报
And we understand you would expect something in return.

732
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:30,022
为了让你离开波兰
For getting you out of Poland?

733
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:33,541
你们被监视了么  就在这儿
Are you being watched? Here?

734
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,621
我们没法说
We can't say.

735
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:38,620
他们非常善于隐匿自己不被发现
They're very good at it when they don't want you to know.

736
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:40,980
我得去贝尔格莱德呆几天
I have to go to Belgrade for a few days.

737
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,942
- 等我回来再说吧   - 别拖太久
- Let's talk when I return. - Don't wait too long.

738
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:49,381
这趟旅行是Jourdain的主意吗
Was this trip Jourdain's idea?

739
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,464
当然  
Of course. 

740
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:52,102
他会尽其所能把你从局里带出来的
He'll do anything to get you out of the office.

741
00:54:52,103 --> 00:54:54,341
这算是一个安慰
But there is one consolation.

742
00:54:54,342 --> 00:54:56,141
一月份去贝尔格莱德?
For Belgrade in January?

743
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:58,333
这是国际联盟的会议  
It's a League of Nations conference. 

744
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,340
所以Anna会在场
So Anna will be there.

745
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:01,342
她甚至有可能在你的火车上
She may even be on your train.

746
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:44,559
晚餐上你想要
Would you prefer 

747
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,140
首席还是次席 Colonel
the first or second seating for dinner, Colonel?

748
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:49,382
Skarbek小姐选择哪种席位了?
Which seating is Mademoiselle Skarbek down for?

749
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:53,821
这位女士不在名单内 先生
The lady's not listed, sir.

750
00:55:53,822 --> 00:55:55,062
那么要次席
The second, then.

751
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:19,462
还要点别的么 先生
You prefer something else, sir?

752
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,422
一杯人头马
Just a Remy Martin.

753
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:32,421
Anna
Anna!

754
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,741
我在找你  你去哪了
I looked for you. Where were you?

755
00:56:34,742 --> 00:56:36,942
我和一些同事去了克拉科夫
I got on at Krakow with some colleagues.

756
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:39,262
我还单独进餐  真是浪费
And I dined alone. What a waste.

757
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:41,302
请坐吧
Please...

758
00:56:47,422 --> 00:56:48,941
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

759
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,861
和你去同一个会议
The same conference as you.

760
00:56:50,862 --> 00:56:52,861
我怀疑它能起到什么好作用
I doubt it will do any good.

761
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:55,022
还有人听国联的话么
Does anyone listen to the League any more?

762
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:58,381
尤其现在墨索里尼带着意大利退出了
Especially now Mussolini's pulled Italy out.

763
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:00,102
你希望知道什么呢
What do you hope to learn?

764
00:57:01,422 --> 00:57:02,459
老实说 
To be honest, 

765
00:57:02,459 --> 00:57:04,902
在听说你也在那儿之前我也打算请辞这差事的
I intended to bow out till I heard you'd be there.

766
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:09,661
你脑子里在想什么  一场火车上的罗曼史?
What did you have in mind? An adventure on a train?

767
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:11,581
不是
No.

768
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:13,861
更多
More.

769
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,582
我在追求你 Anna
I'm pursuing you, Anna.

770
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:20,581
你知道我的处境
You know my situation.

771
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:21,782
是的 我知道
Yes, I do.

772
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:24,782
这毫无影响
Makes no difference.

773
00:57:28,622 --> 00:57:30,622
我们还几乎不了解对方
We hardly know each other.

774
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:32,501
你觉着我们到哪儿了
Where do you think we are?

775
00:58:32,502 --> 00:58:34,022
下一站是布达佩斯
The next stop's Budapest.

776
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:37,582
我宁愿谈谈华沙
I'd rather talk about Warsaw.

777
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,422
我爱上你了 Anna
I'm in love with you, Anna.

778
00:58:43,782 --> 00:58:45,582
我都忘了这种感觉了
I'd forgotten these feelings.

779
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:50,261
你确定
Are you sure about this?

780
00:58:50,262 --> 00:58:52,020
世事多变
With the way things are in the world,

781
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:54,022
这是我唯一能确定的事情
it's the only thing I AM sure about.

782
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:58,902
并且我不相信你是爱Max的
And I don't believe you're in love with Max.

783
00:59:01,702 --> 00:59:05,462
你并不知道我对Max的感情
You have no idea about my feelings for Max!

784
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:08,022
我曾漂泊不定
I was adrift.

785
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:11,662
他将我引入这项工作
He pushed me to take this job.

786
00:59:13,702 --> 00:59:16,861
他让我感觉到我是有用的
He made me feel useful...

787
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:18,742
很有用的人
relevant.

788
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:22,782
Max是我的锚
Max is my anchor.

789
00:59:25,702 --> 00:59:27,542
现在无法安定的人是我
Then it's me who's adrift.

790
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:32,062
你必须给我时间
You must give me time.

791
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:35,662
去结束这一切
To end it my way.

792
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:53,102
你被监视了 我的朋友
You're under surveillance, my friend.

793
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:56,981
并不是高等级别的 我们很容易发现他们
Not very high-grade, we spotted them quite easily.

794
00:59:56,982 --> 00:59:58,541
他们
"Them"?

795
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:01,302
一个四人的队伍 所以他们很谨慎
A team of four, so they are taking it seriously.

796
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:03,834
一个乌克兰人 
One's Ukrainian, 

797
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:06,580
其他三个是德裔波兰人
the other three are Poles, of German extraction.

798
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:09,284
他们中是不是有一个尖嘴猴腮的 
Does one of them have a pinched face, 

799
01:00:09,284 --> 01:00:10,860
像一只好斗的黄鼠狼
like a fierce weasel?

800
01:00:11,263 --> 01:00:12,388
你见过他们   
You've seen him before?  

801
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:14,341
是啊  Uhl被绑架的那一天
Yeah. The day Uhl was abducted.

802
01:00:14,342 --> 01:00:16,096
就是他  他们在看着呢
That's him. They are watching

803
01:00:16,097 --> 01:00:18,940
不论在公寓里还是出门你都被监视了
your apartment and tailing you when you go out.

804
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:21,727
我想你知道我和Anna 
I suppose you know things are heating up 

805
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:22,622
Skarbek的关系
between Anna Skarbek

806
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:24,301
正在升温
and me.

807
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:28,542
我听说了  上星期她不是留宿两次了么
I had heard. Didn't she stay over twice last week?

808
01:00:30,102 --> 01:00:32,262
我想让她搬过来同住
I want her to move in with me.

809
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,189
一个曾经和一个有着可疑声誉的
A woman who was formerly living in

810
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:37,102
俄罗斯流亡者
sin with a Russian emigre

811
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:39,101
同居的女人
of dubious reputation?

812
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,102
这足够把你的上司吓得尿裤子了
That should make your superiors piss their pantaloons!

813
01:00:49,302 --> 01:00:54,181
Max很脆弱  你还不懂么
Max is fragile. Can't you understand?

814
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:57,861
他感觉 无家可归
He feels... displaced.

815
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,804
一无所有  
Dispossessed. 

816
01:00:59,804 --> 01:01:01,901
一旦我离开了 他就完全孤身一人了
When I leave, he'll be completely alone.

817
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:04,101
所以你还没有告诉他么
So you still haven't told him?

818
01:01:04,102 --> 01:01:06,781
还没有 我需要拿捏好时间
Not yet, I have to pick my moment.

819
01:01:06,782 --> 01:01:10,701
我们的生活并不像在你床上一样简单
Our lives aren't as simple as they are in your bed.

820
01:01:10,702 --> 01:01:13,022
我们的生活从来不简单
Our lives will never be simple.

821
01:01:24,702 --> 01:01:26,301
是谁
Who is it?

822
01:01:26,302 --> 01:01:28,782
Malka Rozen  求你了中校 
Malka Rozen. Please, Colonel, 

823
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:30,146
让我进去
let me in!

824
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:39,141
噢 老天  他受伤了
Oh, God! He's hurt!

825
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:42,014
Viktor  我们来这的路上  
Viktor. We were on our way here. 

826
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:43,461
他们知道了!
They know!

827
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:46,101
他在冰上滑倒伤到了脚踝   
He fell on the ice and hurt his ankle. 

828
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:46,670
在哪儿
Where?

829
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,247
那个小公园里   
In the small park. 

830
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,178
教堂边的广场上?
In the square by the church?

831
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:50,781
是的 对 那有个教堂
Yes, yes, there is a church!

832
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:53,497
Wlada 带Rozen夫人去厨房 
Wlada, take Madame Rozen into the kitchen 

833
01:01:53,497 --> 01:01:54,212
泡些茶
and make some tea.

834
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:01,377
那是谁  发生什么事了   
Who is it? What's going on? 

835
01:02:01,377 --> 01:02:02,262
出事了  我得走了
There's a problem. I have to go out.

836
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:08,346
我走后 就把门关好 
When I leave, lock the door behind me 

837
01:02:08,346 --> 01:02:09,462
别给任何人开门
and don't open it for anyone.

838
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:08,954
没事了 没事了
It's all right, it's all right,

839
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:10,827
- Viktor   - 他们知道  
- Viktor. - They know,  

840
01:03:11,271 --> 01:03:11,990
上校 他们知道了
Colonel.They know.

841
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,822
好了 好了 没事 来吧
All right, all right, all right. Come on.

842
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:17,422
别担心  我会搞定的
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

843
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:23,182
谢谢你
Thank you.

844
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:35,823
为什么是今晚 Viktor  
Why tonight, Viktor? 

845
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:36,475
发生什么事了
What happened?

846
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:41,341
大使馆临时召开晚间会议
A late meeting was called at the Embassy.

847
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:43,981
我们的一个朋友
One of our friends...

848
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:47,381
一个很好的老朋友
a good friend from the old days...

849
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:49,741
突然不肯跟我们说话了
suddenly wouldn't talk to us.

850
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,061
他都看在眼里
It was in his eyes.

851
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:54,422
他被审问了 我们能感觉得到
He'd been questioned, we could feel it.

852
01:03:56,262 --> 01:04:00,261
我们知道  我们甚至都没回家取我们的东西
We knew. We didn't even go home to get our things.

853
01:04:00,262 --> 01:04:02,142
好了 继续走吧  没多远了
Right, keep walking. Not far.

854
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:05,102
你半辈子都在为他们干活
You work half your life for them.

855
01:04:05,103 --> 01:04:08,621
25年的服务 公忠体国
25 years of service, faith and obedience.

856
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:10,839
到现在你还会
And still you're afraid of 

857
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,982
害怕半夜的敲门声
the knock on the door at midnight.

858
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:17,382
怎么停下了
Why have we stopped?

859
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:48,141
他是谁 Vicktor
Who was he, Viktor?

860
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:49,622
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

861
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,862
Anna 是我
Anna, it's me.

862
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:05,104
Viktor  你还好吗   
Viktor! Are you all right? 

863
01:05:05,104 --> 01:05:06,777
他冻僵了  Wlada 烧热水
He's frozen. Wlada, run a hot bath.

864
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,940
有多热就多热  再拿些干衣服来
As hot as you can get it. And some dry clothes.

865
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,462
我能做什么  我能帮什么忙吗
What can I do? Can I help?

866
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:13,768
你现在必须回家 Anna  
You must go home now, Anna. 

867
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:15,758
你什么都没看见
And you saw none of this.

868
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:38,020
看在老天的面上 带他们到大使馆
For God's sake, bring them to the Embassy!

869
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,542
冒着跟苏联政府发生外交冲突的危险吗
Risk a diplomatic confrontation with the Soviets?

870
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:42,741
巴黎方面会想解决这个的
Paris will want to handle this.

871
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,147
巴黎能足够快地搞定他们
Paris will get them soon enough.

872
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,860
找架私人飞机带他们到那
Find a private plane to get them there.

873
01:05:45,861 --> 01:05:47,488
我们必须把这事揽自己身上
We have to keep this to ourselves.

874
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,260
我们不能冒让波兰人尴尬的危险
We can't risk embarrassing the Poles.

875
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:51,174
你不应该自己一个人管这事的
You shouldn't be running this alone.

876
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,822
他们为我而来  他们信任我
They came to me. They trust me.

877
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,022
你的伯爵夫人也信任你
So did your Countess.

878
01:05:56,742 --> 01:05:58,340
- 你带了几个人   - 两个
- How many are with you? - Two.

879
01:05:58,341 --> 01:05:59,912
一个安排在后街 一个安排在
Put one in the back alley, one on

880
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:02,342
楼梯上 你守前门  带家伙了吗
the stairs and you out front. Do you have a weapon?

881
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:05,462
好极了  行动吧
Good. Don't hesitate.

882
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:11,221
我们在等谁  我们的德国朋友吗
Who are we expecting? Our German friends?

883
01:06:11,222 --> 01:06:13,102
不是的 是俄国人  苏联内务人民委员会的
No, these are Russians. NKVD.

884
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:16,182
那敢情好啊
Oh. It will be a pleasure.

885
01:06:56,742 --> 01:06:59,141
我们和法国之间没有什么
We had little to do with France.

886
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,742
我们行动集中在波兰人身上
Our operations were centred on the Poles.

887
01:07:01,743 --> 01:07:05,421
尤其是对社会党的渗透上
Especially penetration of the socialist parties.

888
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:08,581
莫斯科总部看中这个
Moscow Central is obsessed with this.

889
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:10,981
我们做的与他人无异
We did what everyone does.

890
01:07:10,982 --> 01:07:15,141
作战计划 武器生产 政治诽谤
War plans, arms production, political personalities,

891
01:07:15,142 --> 01:07:17,101
边境防御
border defences.

892
01:07:17,102 --> 01:07:21,181
我觉得这和你的工作差远了 中校
I doubt it's much different from what you do, Colonel.

893
01:07:21,182 --> 01:07:22,981
德国的情报网呢
Any German networks?

894
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:24,699
我们还没掌握他们  
We didn't handle them. 

895
01:07:25,214 --> 01:07:27,941
那是保护区的中坚力量
That was the preserve of the elite.

896
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:29,501
不是你吗
Not you?

897
01:07:29,502 --> 01:07:32,942
这些日子搞情报的犹太人不那么吃香
The Jews in the service aren't so favoured these days.

898
01:07:32,943 --> 01:07:36,581
没德国的情报么?  你确定?
No German information? You're sure?

899
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:38,501
只有流言
Only gossip.

900
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:40,221
比如
Such as?

901
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,621
一个集中营 
A camp, 

902
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:44,460
他们在波美拉尼亚培养波兰的间谍
in Pomerania where they train spies to work in Poland.

903
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:46,700
- 当然你早知道了   - 我当然知道
- Surely you know already. - Of course I know!

904
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:49,226
如果要我说服巴黎挽救你们的老命 
If I'm to convince Paris to save your skins, 

905
01:07:49,226 --> 01:07:50,375
我需要的情报可不止这点
I need more than this.

906
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:59,221
你对IN6了解有多少
What do you know about IN6?

907
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:03,621
IN6  是Kovak在经营的吗
IN6? Was that Kovak's operation?

908
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:07,861
不 不是Kovak  是Morozov
No, it wasn't Kovak... it was Morozov.

909
01:08:07,862 --> 01:08:11,101
她说的没错 是Morozov
She's right, it was Morozov.

910
01:08:11,102 --> 01:08:12,981
那是什么
What was it?

911
01:08:12,982 --> 01:08:16,781
他在IN6里有线人
He had a contact who worked in the IN6 office.

912
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:18,276
某个帮他向黑色阵线隐瞒他的
Someone who had concealed his

913
01:08:18,277 --> 01:08:22,380
- 政治背景的人   - 他们
- political affiliation to the Black Front. - They were...

914
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,100
我知道  希特勒在纳粹党内的反对者 
I know. Hitler's opponents in the Nazi Party. 

915
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:24,691
左翼势力
The left wing.

916
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:25,236
继续   
Go on. 

917
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:28,261
这个人受胁迫成为苏联的间谍
This man was pressured to become a Soviet agent.

918
01:08:28,262 --> 01:08:30,861
威胁奏效了一段时间 然后
It worked for a while, then...

919
01:08:30,862 --> 01:08:34,902
Morozov被肃清了 于是行动就停止了
Morozov was purged, so the operation stalled.

920
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:37,399
于是这个人
And this man 

921
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:39,660
继续在德国情报机构的核心工作
still works in the heart of German intelligence?

922
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,582
是的  他并不是希特勒那边的人
Yes. And he is no friend of Hitler.

923
01:08:44,142 --> 01:08:46,542
叫什么
A name?

924
01:08:48,502 --> 01:08:50,501
我需要一个名字
I need a name.

925
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:53,262
那只是个代号
It was a code name.

926
01:08:54,982 --> 01:08:58,181
一 一种鸟  我想是种鸟的名字
A...A bird. I think it was a bird.

927
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,062
Kanarejka  还是什么
Kanarejka? Something like that?

928
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:03,941
- 不 不是的   - 那是什么
- No, it wasn't. - Well, what then?

929
01:09:03,942 --> 01:09:05,742
是种海鸟 亲爱的
It was a seabird, dear.

930
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:10,141
在海港随处可见
In harbours everywhere.

931
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:12,302
"Chaika" 就是这个
"Chaika," That was it!

932
01:09:13,902 --> 01:09:16,181
海鸥
Seagull.

933
01:09:16,182 --> 01:09:17,942
她是不是很厉害啊
Isn't she something?

934
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:27,462
你打算和Rozens夫妇一起飞往巴黎吗
So you intend to fly to Paris with the Rozens?

935
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,221
- 是的   - 真的有必要吗
- I do, yes. - Is that really necessary?

936
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:32,100
我们必须继续追查这情报
We have to follow up on this information.

937
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:35,060
这可是希特勒在他自己党内的敌人
This is opposition to Hitler inside his own party.

938
01:09:35,061 --> 01:09:36,902
如果我们能挖掘到它 那可是无价之宝
If we can tap into that, it could be invaluable.

939
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:41,827
当Rozen夫人到你公寓的时候 
Hmm. When Madame Rozen came to your apartment, 

940
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:42,461
你不是一个人吧
you weren't alone?

941
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:46,341
不是  我的女仆在  还有一位年轻女士
No. My maid was there. And also a young lady.

942
01:09:46,342 --> 01:09:48,451
Anna Skarbek   
Anna Skarbek. Yes. 

943
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:49,661
是的  我们当时在一起吃晚餐
We'd been to dinner.

944
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,528
当时是凌晨一点以后了
This was after one in the morning,

945
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,780
所以可以假设你们不止是共进晚餐
so presumably you'd had more than dinner.

946
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,421
这关你什么事   
Is that any of your business? 

947
01:09:55,852 --> 01:09:56,620
大使认为这关我的事
The Ambassador thinks it is.

948
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:58,740
因为你现在严重受到牵连了
Because you're now seriously compromised.

949
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:00,655
这女人可是Maxim Mostov的情人
The woman is Maxim Mostov's mistress.

950
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:02,260
这段关系早就结束了
That relationship is at an end.

951
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:03,612
她很有可能不仅只是个
It's possible she's more than

952
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:05,662
倒霉的情人而是个心甘情愿的共犯
a hapless mistress but a willing accomplice.

953
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:07,701
真是扯淡
That's ridiculous!

954
01:10:07,702 --> 01:10:09,048
大使强烈认为
The Ambassador feels very strongly 

955
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:10,620
在这样的环境下
in the circumstances

956
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:12,782
最好是断了这份关系
it would be best to terminate this liaison.

957
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:16,661
我可没打算这么做
I'm not prepared to do that.

958
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:20,502
或许你应该仔细地考虑一下
Perhaps you should think very carefully about that.

959
01:10:24,222 --> 01:10:27,581
Rozen夫妇叛变了 是吧
The Rozens were defecting, presumably?

960
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:29,901
你知道我不能对此发表评论
You know I can't comment on that.

961
01:10:29,902 --> 01:10:31,941
Max非常确定是这样
Max feels certain that's it.

962
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:34,181
你和他讨论过了?
You discussed it with him?

963
01:10:34,182 --> 01:10:36,982
他听说的  谁没听说呢
He's heard about it. Who hasn't?

964
01:10:42,182 --> 01:10:45,382
Anna 现在的形势非常棘手
Anna, this is a very tricky situation.

965
01:10:47,262 --> 01:10:51,141
大使不希望我再跟你见面
The Embassy doesn't want me to see you any more.

966
01:10:51,142 --> 01:10:54,621
为什么  因为他们认为我是个间谍吗 
Why? Cos they think I'm a spy? 

967
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:55,781
还是个荡妇
Or a slut?

968
01:10:55,782 --> 01:10:57,902
如果他们坚持 我就辞职
If they insist, I'll resign.

969
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:03,860
我得离开一阵子
I have to go away for a few days.

970
01:11:03,861 --> 01:11:05,293
等我回来的时候 
By the time I get back, 

971
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,622
我希望你和Max真的了断了
I want it all over between you and Max.

972
01:11:07,623 --> 01:11:09,821
我不喜欢最后通牒
I don't like ultimatums.

973
01:11:09,822 --> 01:11:11,422
我希望你能自由
I need you to be free.

974
01:13:55,782 --> 01:13:58,182
把头低下
Keep your heads down.

975
01:14:11,102 --> 01:14:12,462
继续
Go on!

976
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:26,421
他看起来很火大
He seems upset.

977
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:28,181
换做是你呢
Wouldn't you be?

978
01:14:28,182 --> 01:14:30,742
喂  什么啊
Hey! What?!

979
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,422
我不介意你和他搞上几次
I don't mind if you screw him a few times

980
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:11,821
摆脱你的组织
and get it out of your system.

981
01:15:11,822 --> 01:15:13,341
不是这样的
It's not like that.

982
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,941
我知道他的魅力所在  战争英雄
I can see the attraction. The war hero.

983
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:20,422
20年前杀害了我无数同胞
Killed lots of my countrymen 20 years ago.

984
01:15:22,262 --> 01:15:25,021
他穿起制服很帅气 甚至
And he looks good in a uniform, even if

985
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:27,302
他走起路来都像屁股上有根拨火棍似的
he walks like he has a poker up his arse.

986
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:29,302
Max 别这样
Max, don't do this.

987
01:15:32,022 --> 01:15:35,581
好吧 我早就知道会有这一天
Well, I suppose I knew this would happen one day.

988
01:15:35,582 --> 01:15:38,221
你还年轻 你还有活力
You are young, you are alive.

989
01:15:38,222 --> 01:15:40,712
我只是个悲哀的 
I'm just a sad, 

990
01:15:40,713 --> 01:15:42,581
卑鄙的老混蛋
miserable old bastard.

991
01:15:42,582 --> 01:15:44,461
当我们一起去聚会的时候
I see it in people's faces

992
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:46,341
我从人们的脸上看得出来
when we go to parties.

993
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,781
"她是怎么看上他的"
"What dose she see in him?"

994
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:50,581
Max 你是个好人 
Max, you're a wonderful man 

995
01:15:50,582 --> 01:15:52,741
是我自己选择和你在一起的
and I chose to be with you.

996
01:15:52,742 --> 01:15:54,742
现在你选择离开
And now you choose to go.

997
01:15:56,942 --> 01:16:00,462
我出去了  我回来的时候你最好已经走了
I'm going out. Just be gone when I get back.

998
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:04,582
而且我可没藏着见鬼的伏特加
And don't hide the goddamn vodka!

999
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:15,233
你认为Rozen夫妇告诉你的事
Do you think there's any value 

1000
01:16:15,234 --> 01:16:15,780
究竟有没有价值
in what the Rozens told you...

1001
01:16:17,777 --> 01:16:20,902
或是那只是为了保全性命杜撰出来的
or is it just some fiction to save their skins?

1002
01:16:20,903 --> 01:16:24,061
我相信他们  我想继续追查
I believe them. I want to follow up on it.

1003
01:16:24,062 --> 01:16:25,724
那就得等我们自己
That'll have to wait 

1004
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:27,180
着手调查他们了
until we've had a go at them ourselves.

1005
01:16:27,181 --> 01:16:30,222
我急着赶回华沙
I'm anxious to get back to Warsaw as soon as possible.

1006
01:16:31,662 --> 01:16:34,420
这座城市貌似对你有很大的吸引力
The city seems to have attractions for you.

1007
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:36,900
当然这不是我们当初派你到那时的态度
Certainly not your attitude when we posted you there.

1008
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:39,277
我肯定我待在那准没错 
I believe it's the right place for me... 

1009
01:16:39,278 --> 01:16:40,142
此时此刻
and the right time.

1010
01:16:40,143 --> 01:16:42,061
我同意
And I agree.

1011
01:16:42,062 --> 01:16:45,456
你能很好地解决这事儿的
And you handled this whole episode most commendably, 

1012
01:16:45,457 --> 01:16:46,382
中校
Colonel.

1013
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:52,302
享受你的咖啡吧
I'll leave you to your coffee.

1014
01:17:01,102 --> 01:17:03,621
他为什么不喜欢你
Why doesn't he like you?

1015
01:17:03,622 --> 01:17:07,381
他讨厌戴高乐 也知道我为他效力
He hates de Gaulle and knows I served with him.

1016
01:17:07,382 --> 01:17:10,141
他怀念战争 那是他的问题
He missed the war, that's his problem.

1017
01:17:10,142 --> 01:17:12,942
想到你那些勋章就受不了
Can't bear the thought of all your medals.

1018
01:17:15,342 --> 01:17:19,141
上一次你来这的时候 提到一位Lapp博士
Last time you were here, you mentioned a Dr Lapp.

1019
01:17:19,142 --> 01:17:21,501
你的直觉是正确的
Your instincts were right.

1020
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:22,955
这位好博士
The good doctor is 

1021
01:17:22,956 --> 01:17:25,861
在德国的军事情报部门

1022
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:28,030
他和Admiral Canaris和他那

反谍报部门都讨厌盖世太保
his Abwehr loathe the SD

1025
01:17:29,622 --> 01:17:33,141
和希特勒 所有的下流勾当
and Hitler, the whole nasty business.

1026
01:17:33,142 --> 01:17:35,701
政治斗争和社会斗争不分轩轾
It's as much social as political.

1027
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:37,982
他们视自己为绅士 
They see themselves as gentlemen, 

1028
01:17:37,983 --> 01:17:39,502
视纳粹为恶棍
the Nazis as gangsters.

1029
01:17:39,503 --> 01:17:41,862
那么他会有用
Then he could be useful.

1030
01:17:48,222 --> 01:17:49,981
来了
All right.

1031
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:53,261
来了
All right!

1032
01:17:53,262 --> 01:17:56,462
我来了
I'm coming!

1033
01:17:59,902 --> 01:18:01,151
那是谁   
Who's that? 

1034
01:18:01,152 --> 01:18:04,844
Klaus和Frida身无长物地
Klaus and Frida fled from Frankfurt

1035
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:06,460
逃离了法兰克福
with only the clothes on their backs.

1036
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:08,849
他们有给政府带来威胁吗
Do they pose a threat to the government?

1037
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,820
他们是大提琴手 看在上帝的面上
They're CELLISTS, for God's sake.

1038
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:12,314
根据现在德国的法律 
By German law now, persons of

超过25%非雅利安血统的人禁止演出
more than 25% non-Aryan blood are forbidden to play

贝多芬 莫扎特还有巴赫的音乐
Beethoven, Mozart and Bach.

1041
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:21,161
把他们留给格什温吧

{\pos(192,26)}美国著名作曲家

温莎公爵究竟为什么
What on earth was the Duke of Windsor

1044
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:25,500
要拜访希特勒
doing visiting Hitler?

1045
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,060
也许是Simpson夫人的主意 
Probably Mrs Simpson's idea, 

1046
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:29,340
他总是照她说的做
he always does what she says.

1047
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:31,500
她是怎么拴住他的
What sort of hold does she have over him?

1048
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:34,422
我想象她一掌拍得他想起他的奶娘
I imagine she spanks him and reminds him of his nanny!

1049
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,741
这是非常英国的事
That's a very English thing.

1050
01:18:36,742 --> 01:18:40,011
您华沙的电话终于来了 中校

别太久哦
Don't be too long.

1053

Anna 你到哪去了

我一整天都在找你
I've been trying to reach you all day.

1056
01:18:58,423 --> 01:19:02,181
- 怎么了   - 他们带走了Max
- What's the matter? - They took Max!

1057
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:04,063
他们像带走一个罪犯一样
They just took him in the night 

1058
01:19:04,064 --> 01:19:05,260
在晚上带走了他
like a common criminal!

1059
01:19:05,261 --> 01:19:07,220
等等 你在说什么 谁带走了Max
Wait, what are you saying? Who took Max?

1060
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:09,145
你知道是谁带走了他 看在上帝的面上
You know who took him, for God's sake!

1061
01:19:09,146 --> 01:19:11,020
我去拜访了你的朋友Pakulski
I went to visit your friend Pakulski.

1062
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:13,540
他说波兰人对他的签证毫无异议
He said the Poles had no problem with his visa,

1063
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,940
是法国人想让他滚的
it was the French that wanted him out.

1064
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:19,100
你就不能像我说的那样 由我来解决这些问题
You couldn't wait for me to deal with it like I asked!

1065
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:21,043
Anna 你这样无济于事  
Anna, you're not making sense. 

1066
01:19:21,044 --> 01:19:22,500
他们甚至不让我见他
They won't even let me see him!

1067
01:19:22,501 --> 01:19:24,590
他们要把他遣送回莫斯科
They're sending him back to Moscow.

1068
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:26,382
这 这简直是判他死刑
It's... it's a death sentence!

1069
01:19:26,383 --> 01:19:30,822
Anna  Anna 喂

Mercier中校表示他很遗憾

1071
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:57,101
但是他必须得离开了
but he was obliged to leave.

1072
01:19:57,102 --> 01:20:01,461
国家大事么 将军?
Affairs of state, General?

1073
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:05,181
- 也可能是心事哦   - 怎么说
- Or the heart, perhaps. - Why would you say that?

1074
01:20:05,182 --> 01:20:07,034
目前为止我见过他两次 
Well, I've met him twice now 

1075
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,382
两次他都没表现出

1076
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:11,822
想要和我春风一度的意思
not the slightest inclination to take me to bed.

1077
01:20:49,742 --> 01:20:52,334
你得明白 大使没得选择
You must realise, the Ambassador had no choice!

1078
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:54,540
你受到牵连 这势在必行
You were compromised, it was imperative.

1079
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:55,550
这是报复
It was vindictive,

1080
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,412
你没必要这么窝囊地
unnecessary and cowardly of you 

1081
01:20:57,413 --> 01:20:58,860
等我离开才下手
to wait until after I left.

1082
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:00,334
我们现在有别的优先事务
We have other priorities now.

1083
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:02,620
你从Rozen夫妇那盘问到什么情报吗
What did you learn from the Rozen debriefing?

1084
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:05,222
我已经得到授权管理此事了
I have leads I've been authorised to act upon.

1085
01:21:05,223 --> 01:21:06,702
他们是干什么的
What are they?

1086
01:21:07,902 --> 01:21:09,455
就像我说的 我已经得到授权了
Like I said, I have been authorised.

巴黎方面觉得知道的人越少越好
Paris feels the fewer people in the know, the better.

1088
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:26,261
如果她想消失一会儿 就让她去呗
If she wants to disappear for a while, so be it.

1089
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:29,701
我得和她谈谈
I need to talk to her.

1090
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:31,342
我需要一个解释的机会
I need a chance to explain.

1091
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:34,301
她充满了歉疚和愤怒
She's filled with guilt and anger.

1092
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:36,125
因为如果她没和你相爱的话
Because what happened to Max would

1093
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:38,700
这事就不会发生在Max身上
not have happened if she had not fallen in love.

1094
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:40,382
她对你关上了心门
Her heart is closed to you.

1095
01:21:42,702 --> 01:21:45,822
我的建议么  等待时机吧
My advice? Bide your time.

1096
01:21:47,022 --> 01:21:48,862
我们还有多少时间
How much time do any of us have?

希特勒随时会进军奥地利
Hitler will march into Austria any minute.

1098

他不会在那停留的
And he won't stop there.

1099
01:21:54,262 --> 01:21:57,742
所以我们必须想方设法战斗
So we must fight any way we can.
