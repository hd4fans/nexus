{\pos(192,26)}前情提要

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,841
我收集到的情报显示
The information I've received suggests to me that the

6
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:04,353
德国人正在准备一场不同的战斗
Germans are preparing for a different kind of combat.

7
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,247
又一个你关于
Is this another one of

8
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:07,439
可能的战争的悲观预言么?
your gloomy predictions about the likelihood of war?

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,240
我该嫉妒这个中校么
Should I be jealous of the Colonel?

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,040
我爱上你了 Anna
I'm in love with you, Anna.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,840
我都忘了这种感觉了
I'd forgotten these feelings.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,920
他们抓走了Max
They took Max!

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,760
他们就像拘捕一个普通犯人一样在夜里抓走了他
They just took him in the night like a common criminal.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
我需要跟她谈谈  我需要一个解释的机会
I need to talk to her. I need a chance to explain.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,680
朋友 她现在满腹愧疚 怒火中烧
My friend, she's filled with guilt and anger,

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,600
因为如果她没有陷入爱情 发生在Max身上的事
because what happened to Max would not have happened

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,320
原本就不会发生
if she had not fallen in love.

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,241
如果要我说服巴黎挽救你们的老命 
If I'm going to convince Paris to save your skins, 

19
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,320
我需要名字
I need a name.

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,840
Chaika  就是这个
Chaika! That was it!

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,040
有个人可能会对你有帮助
There is a man who might help you.

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,880
他曾经是一位古代语言学教授
He was once a professor of ancient languages.

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,772
但现在他正躲在
Now he is hiding in

24
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,120
捷克斯洛伐克 因为盖世太保在追捕他
Czechoslovakia because he's hunted by the Gestapo.

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
你应该即刻动身
You should go there quickly.

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,240
因为恐怕 他已经命不久矣了
I fear he may not be long for this world.

华沙间谍

31
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:46,259
我要去医院

32
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:46,999
异想天开

33
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,171
我的耳朵都快掉下来了

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,440
上校  有您的电话
Colonel! A phone call.

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
能不能等到我早茶之后再去接呢
Won't it keep till after my morning coffee?

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
发生了一场枪击案
There's been a shooting.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,823
你是Jean-Francois Mercier中校 
You are Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier, 

38
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:04,960
陆军武官
Military Attache

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,320
任职于华沙的法国大使馆
at the French Embassy in Warsaw.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,400
但那并不全是你工作的全部 是不是 中校
But that's not all you do, is it, Colonel?

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,600
你又是干什么的呢
What is it you do?

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,520
我追踪像你这样的人
I go after people like you,

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,840
像你这样 破坏我祖国安全的人
who undermine the security of my country.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,326
你帮助一对俄国特工夫妇叛逃了  
You helped a Russian couple to defect. 

45
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:20,480
为什么这么做
Why?

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
他们担心自己的生命受到威胁
They were afraid for their lives.

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,200
所以 作为交换他们提供给你你想要的情报信息
Presumably offered information in exchange for your help?

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,680
干咱们这行的游戏规则 恩?
That's the way things are in our business, hm?

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,960
我想知道他们透露给你的情报是什么
I'd like to know what that information was.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,160
我不会告诉你的 你这是在浪费时间
I'm not going to tell you so this is a waste of time.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
唔
Hm.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,200
中校
Colonel,

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
我们两国并没有交战
our countries are not at war.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,320
恩 是暂时没有
Not yet, no.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,600
希望永远别起战端
Let's hope never.

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,040
我们都是见不得光的人
We're both men who work in the shadows.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,816
我想 你跟这儿的一位年轻姑娘
You're involved with a young woman 

58
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,400
有千丝万缕的关联 是吗
here, I believe?

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,680
Anna Skarbek
Anna Skarbek?

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,560
那跟这事儿有什么关系
How is that relevant?

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,360
我的重点在于 咱俩都得有命活着回去
My point is that we have lives to go back to.

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,280
我呢 有家有室 还有一个尚未出世的孩子
Myself, I am married with a new child on the way.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,600
你要怎么才能再见你的家人呢
How will you ever see your family again?

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
你永远都逃不出波兰了
You'll never get out of Poland.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,262
你的手下一个已经死了 
You have one man dead, 

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,480
另一个就像被宰的猪一样流血
another bleeding like a pig...

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,640
而且你的汽车还在漏油
And your car is leaking gasoline.

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,800
请让我们独处好么 护士
Could you leave us, nurse?

69
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,000
你看见她跟我笑了吗  她迷上我了
Did you see that smile? She wants me.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,600
言之尚早  怎么回事儿
Too early to tell. What happened?

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,880
汽车爆炸的时候我们到了
We arrived when the car blew up.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
那德国人呢
And the Germans?

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
一个在停尸房 另外两个被我们关起来了
One in the morgue, two in our cells.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
德国大使馆跟我们要人  
Their embassy wants them back. 

76
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,160
我们跟他们说不可能
We've told them not a chance.

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
你的大使馆说是要来探望你
Your embassy will be paying you a visit.

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
唔
Mm.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
我想在他们来之前离开这儿
I want to be out of here before that.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,280
我才不想给他们一个阻止我的借口
I don't want to give them an excuse to stop me.

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
阻止你干什么
Doing what?

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,240
你知道我不能告诉你
You know I can't tell you.

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,520
但我需要出趟远门儿
But I need to take a trip.

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
帮我离开这儿吧
Help me out of here.

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,120
就这么离开?
Looking like that?

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
给我你的大衣
Lend me your coat.

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,080
这儿  就是这里
Here. In here.

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,200
对不起 先生们 他看上去已经离开了
I'm sorry, sir, he seems to have gone.

89
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,315
1938年3月

90
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,725
捷克斯洛伐克 Tsesin

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,200
您在等人吗
Waiting for someone?

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
看来她放我鸽子了
Looks like she stood me up.

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Halbach先生
Herr Halbach.

94
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
Halbach先生
Herr Halbach!

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,905
什么事 

96
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,299
你想要什么

97
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,343
我非常重要的消息带给您

98
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,520
我们能单独谈谈吗
Can we talk in private?

99
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
你不是德国人
You're not German.

100
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,120
不是  能进去聊聊吗
No. Can we go inside?

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,440
把手放在我能看见的地方!
Keep your hands where I can see them!

102
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
请不要把这东西挥来挥去的
Please don't wave that around.

103
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,400
你看上去不是那种惯用枪支火器的人
You don't look like the kind of man who's used to firearms.

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,734
当然不是 我是个老师  
I'm not, I'm a teacher. 

105
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,800
但这并不意味着我不会使用它
It doesn't mean I won't use it.

106
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
你想从我这儿得到什么
What do you want with me?

107
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,120
是你的政治主张把我带到你面前的
It's your politics that bring me here.

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,748
你不会留我活口的  
You won't take me alive. 

109
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,360
敢动一动我就立刻杀了你
I'll kill you if you try.

110
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,103
我不是你的敌人   
I'm not your enemy.  

111
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:38,840
那你他妈的是谁
Then who the hell are you?

112
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
一个朋友
I'm a friend.

113
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,213
而且我必须指出 
And I should point out 

114
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,680
想找到你实在是轻而易举
it wasn't all that difficult to find you.

115
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,400
跪下  现在
On your knees. Now!

116
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,205
Halbach先生

117
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,257
您晚上用晚餐吗

118
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:52,967
今晚不会

119
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,480
谢谢你Franz

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,960
我是来给你提供避难所的 Halbach先生
I'm here to offer you sanctuary, Herr Halbach.

121
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,320
你能在这里待多久  几个月  几年
How long can you stay here? Months? Years?

122
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
大概吧
Perhaps.

123
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,936
希特勒已经攻占了奥地利  
Hitler has already marched into Austria. 

124
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,640
这儿就是他下一个目标
He'll be here next.

125
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,800
接下来你又会去哪儿
Then where will you go?

126
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,120
你说的避难所到底是什么
What exactly is this sanctuary?

127
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,200
一本瑞士护照和五万瑞士法郎
A Swiss passport and 50,000 Swiss Francs.

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
那可是一大笔钱啊
That is a great deal of money.

129
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
请理解 我们不会要求您
Understand, we are not

130
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,440
去做任何针对德国人民和你祖国的事
asking you to do anything against the German

131
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
只要针对希特勒的政权
people or your homeland. Only against the Hitler regime.

132
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,000
那作为回报我得做点什么呢  暗杀什么人?
And what would I have to do for all this? Kill somebody?

133
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
只是去拜访一位故友 带着一份请求去
Visit an old friend, with a request

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
开给他和你所得到的一样的条件
and the same offer we're making to you.

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,520
然后你们俩就都能重获新生了
Then both of you can lead new lives.

136
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
富有 安全的人生
Wealthy, safe lives.

137
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,520
这是预付款
Consider this an advance.

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
你怎么确定我就不会卷款而逃呢
How do you know I won't take this and disappear?

139
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
因为如果那样你就是偷了这笔钱 从我们这里
Because then you will have stolen it... From us.

140
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
那谁又是那位"故友"呢
And who is this "Old friend"?

141
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,320
你过去在黑锋的同伴 现在在IN6工作
A comrade of yours from the Black Front who works in IN6.

142
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,280
他在俄国的化名是Chaika
His Russian alias is Chaika.

143
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,840
现在我知道你在查什么了
Now I see what you're after.

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,800
可他现在在德国
But he is in Germany.

145
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,040
我不能去那儿  我在德国是通缉犯
I can't go there. I'm a wanted criminal in Germany.

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,640
你会拿到一份瑞士护照 跟我的一样
You'll have a Swiss passport, as have I.

147
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,113
我们是来自同一家公司的推销员  
We're salesmen for the same company. 

148
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,720
我们会待在一个小宾馆里
We'll stay in a small hotel

149
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
你只有一个晚上需要露面
and you'll be visible for only one evening.

150
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,840
什么时候开始这个行动
When would this be?

151
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,080
明天就走
We leave tomorrow.

152
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,840
明天  我还有课呢
Tomorrow? But I have classes.

153
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,640
就说你这位教授先生身体抱恙
The Herr Professor is indisposed.

154
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
明天十点之前给我出现在车站
Be at the station before ten.

155
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
我在Tsesin有位朋友
I have a friend here in Tsesin

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
一位对我来说非常重要的朋友
who has made a great difference to me.

157
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,320
我想我应该跟她好好道个别
I should like to say goodbye.

158
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,831
我很抱歉 那是不可能的事  
I'm sorry, that won't be possible. 

159
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,640
还是给她寄个明信片吧
Send her a postcard.

160
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
你们的大使馆已经把跟你们的关系洗脱的干干净净了
Your embassy has washed their hands of you.

161
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,750
他们说你们是
They say you were acting

162
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,800
自发行动 未经任何当局许可
on your own initiative, without any authority.

163
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,120
所以你们不会被遣返德国  而是留在这里
So you are not going back to Germany. You will stay here.

164
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,280
这里是为永远不会回家的人们准备的监狱
This is a prison for people who never go home.

165
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,162
这是你的 Braun先生  
This is yours, Herr Braun. 

166
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:30,800
而我是Lombardo先生
And I am Herr Lombardo.

167
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,840
我们必须给你准备点儿更合适的衣服
We must get you some more suitable clothes.

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,360
你的家人可以用你的新护照旅行了
Your family can travel on your new passport.

169
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,200
不 不 不 已经尘埃落定了
No, no, no, that's all finished,

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
我过去的人生
that part of my life.

171
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,344
我转入地下工作的时候就把他们送走了 
When I went underground, I sent them away, 

172
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:48,760
为了他们的安全
for their safety.

173
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,941
很快我就不知道他们的行踪了 
I no longer know where they are 

174
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,200
他们也不再知道我身在何处
and nor do they know where I am.

175
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,160
你的朋友Chaika有家庭吗
Does your friend Chaika have a family?

176
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,640
有的
Yes.

177
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
他的真名是什么呢
And his real name?

178
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
Johannes Elter
Johannes Elter.

179
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,920
- 你们过去关系好吗   - 哦 当然好
- Were you close?  - Oh, yes.

180
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,645
我们最初都那么热爱我们的政党 
We both loved the party 

181
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:08,680
一个战败国家的崛起
at the start the rising up

182
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,480
民族自尊心的重塑 以及贫穷潦倒的终结
of a defeated nation, the return of pride, the end of poverty.

183
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,560
后来我们才知道究竟发生了什么
And then we saw what was happening.

184
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,640
我的祖母还是犹太人
And I have a Jewish grandmother.

185
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,600
他在参谋总部是做什么工作的
What does he do in the General Staff?

186
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,920
他是书记  但是处于局势的中心
He's a clerk. But he's in the thick of things.

187
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
他赌博吗
Does he gamble?

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
不赌  他是个一毛不拔的铁公鸡
No. He pinches every pfennig.

189
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,640
寻花问柳吗?
Visit whores?

190
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
花他自己的钱么?
And spend his own money?

191
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,880
那他应该会对我的条件非常感兴趣
So he should be interested in my offer.

192
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,680
好了 Lombardo先生
Well, Herr Lombardo...

193
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,680
那取决于他有多贪生怕死了
That depends on how afraid he is.

194
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,536
华沙

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,265
你怎么知道我在华沙
How did you know I was in Warsaw?

196
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,675
知道这些是我的职责所在  
It's my business to know. 

197
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,280
你要在这儿待很久吗
Will you be here long?

198
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,720
不会的  我是过来关了公寓
No. I came to close the apartment.

199
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,360
这儿到处都是书  您请自便吧
There are books everywhere. Help yourself.

200
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,966
很遗憾Mercier不在城里  
Pity Mercier is not in town. 

201
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,280
他会很想见你的
He would want to see you.

202
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,920
我没心思见他 Antoni
I have no wish to see him, Antoni.

203
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,320
Anna 我对国内安全的所有事了如指掌
Anna, I know everything that goes on in Internal Security.

204
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,200
并不是Mercier要求驱逐Max的
The request to expel Max did not come from Mercier.

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,520
消息是从法国来的
It came from the French.

206
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,720
不是从Mercier那
Not from Mercier.

207
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,400
那从谁那里来
Then from whom?

208
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
这我还不是十分确定
I'm not exactly sure.

209
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,840
我还以为你无所不知呢  显然是我高估了
I thought you knew everything. Apparently you don't.

210
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,000
我知道的是他很爱你
I know he loves you.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,560
如果不是这样的话
If he didn't,

212
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,040
我早就想勾搭你了
I would try to seduce you.

213
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,280
你这是要去哪儿呢
Where do you go from here?

214
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,000
国联要派我去西班牙
The League is sending me to Spain.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
西班牙  陷入内战漩涡的国家啊
Spain? The country's in the middle of civil war.

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,658
我要去就外籍人士的释放
I'll be negotiating the

217
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,640
进行谈判  我明天就走
release of foreign nationals. I leave tomorrow.

218
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,960
Jean-Francois在哪儿
Where is Jean-Francois?

219
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,160
我想 他正在前往巴黎的路上
On his way to Paris, I believe.

220
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
巴黎
Paris?

221
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,760
请出示护照
Paesse, bitte.

222
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,760
你们两个都是瑞士人  你们两个一起旅行
You're both Swiss? You're travelling together?

223
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,800
我们为同一家公司工作
We work for the same company.

224
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:21,784
柏林

225
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,760
你们的人就不能准备个像样一点的旅店吗
Couldn't your people afford a decent hotel?

226
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
太显眼了
Too conspicuous.

227
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,085
看这两位迷人的绅士 Trudl

228
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:51,859
要在这儿过夜吗 男孩们

229
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,084
可能要呆三个晚上

230
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:56,551
五个马克一晚上 先交定金

231
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,733
也许 

232
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,279
他们想住一起呢

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,280
谢谢
Danke.

234
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,160
那么 你要去见Elter了
So, you're meeting with Elter.

235
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,240
如果他不愿意 你就提醒他
If he's reluctant, remind him -

236
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,344
是希特勒和他的党派
it's Hitler and his clique

237
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,000
想要把整个国家都卷入战争
that want to take the country into war.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
如果战争来临 受苦受难的都是德国人民
And if it comes, it's the German people who will suffer.

239
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,160
啊哦 喻以大义
Ah, the moral argument.

240
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,560
那会把警察引来的
That will bring the police!

241
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,480
他们是党卫队  警察不会过来找他们麻烦的
They're SS. The police won't bother them.

242
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,280
你为什么要跟他们交待我的事
Why did you tell them about me?

243
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,760
我对你可是一如既往的忠诚
I have always been a faithful friend to you.

244
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
正因为此我才会来的
That's why I'm here.

245
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,760
你能在盖世太保的监牢外面苟延残喘多久
How long can you stay out of a Gestapo cellar?

246
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,840
何况你一直是希特勒的眼中钉肉中刺
And you'll only be harming Hitler.

247
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
我想我们得撤了
I think we have to leave.

248
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,800
大厅里头有个男人 是个党卫队的中队长
There was a man in the lobby, an SS Oberscharfuehrer.

249
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
我想他认出我了
I think he recognised me.

250
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,640
何以见得
From where?

251
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,720
我被盖世太保缠住询问了好几个小时的问题
I've spent many hours being questioned by the Gestapo.

252
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,160
他本该在那的
He could have been there.

253
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,400
快整理行装
Pack your things.

254
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,960
- 你不能这么做   - 上车
- You can't do this!  - Get in.

255
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,920
这太疯狂了
This is madness!

256
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,920
你不能偷走这台车
You can't steal this car.

257
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,880
他们会在这儿消磨好几个小时呢
They'll be in there for hours.

258
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
那么 Elter的事 怎么样了
So, Elter. What happened?

259
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
他还在犹豫
He's unsure.

260
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
第一班渡轮会在八点钟起锚
The first ferry's at eight.

261
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,920
你在对岸就能搭上去哥本哈根的火车了
You can get a train to Copenhagen at the other side.

262
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,840
一到那里 你就能随心所欲的过日子了
Once you're there, you can do whatever you like.

263
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,360
我都快忘了那种不用东躲西藏的日子了
I'd almost forgotten that kind of life.

264
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,400
给你的钱都存放在苏黎世银行  我们决不食言
The funds are in Zurich. We're true to our word.

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,760
你做的这一切有意义吗
Will all this make any difference?

266
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,960
我必须相信这有意义
I have to believe it will.

267
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
Halbach告诉我你总是第一个到
Halbach told me you always arrived first.

268
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,525
这样在其他人来齐之前
So we have a few moments 

269
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:53,600
我们就有几分钟的闲暇来谈谈话
before the others get here.

270
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,120
我不能那么做
I can't do it!

271
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,520
你叫我做的事情 那实在实在危险了
What you're asking, it is too dangerous.

272
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,521
如果有更多的钱给你 
If there was more money, 

273
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:01,080
你是不是就会觉得它没那么危险了
would you find it less dangerous?

274
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,834
你不理解   
You must understand...  

275
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,040
我很理解贪欲   - 你必须明白
I understand greed.  - You must understand...

276
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,240
贪欲让我们的交易简单很多了
It makes things very simple between us.

277
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
你这是叫我出卖我的国家
You are asking me to betray my country.

278
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,840
你原来就出卖过 对苏联人
You've betrayed it before, to the Soviets.

279
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,200
Chaika  这难道不是你的代号吗
Chaika. Wasn't that your code name?

280
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,320
盖世太保对这一切肯定有兴趣
The Gestapo would be interested to know that.

281
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,400
咱们按约定见面
We'll meet as arranged.

282
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,560
这并不是贪欲作祟
This is not about greed.

283
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,305
总有一天 我会离开的  
One day, I will have to leave. 

284
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:13,640
你的金钱就是为那一刻而准备
Your money is for that.

285
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,160
为了给我的家人以安定和幸福 如果情况允许的话
For my family's safety, God willing.

286
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,200
我想你一定有子女吧
You have children, I believe.

287
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
有三个
Three.

288
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,800
我不能告诉他们我对希特勒的看法
I cannot tell them of my feelings for Hitler,

289
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,320
对眼下所发生的事的看法
for what is happening here

290
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,800
因为他们的老师 他们相信眼下的一切
because their teachers, they believe it all.

291
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,492
我的长子 
My eldest, 

292
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:40,760
他和那边的孩子穿着一模一样的制服
he wears the same uniform as the ones over there.

293
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,360
那么 这件事要怎么运作
So, how will this work?

294
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,000
同一时间 同一地点
Same place, same time,

295
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
每隔一周 会有人来这里取走东西
every other week, someone will pick up the drop.

296
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
在内心深处
In my heart,

297
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,200
我一直就是个叛徒
I have always been a traitor.

298
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,600
他给我的大部分东西都毫无意义
Much of what he gave me was pointless.

299
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,080
但是但是呈给你看的这些不是
But everything you see here is not.

300
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
这是一份阿登高地的森林调查图
It's a forest survey map of the Ardennes,

301
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
{\pos(192,50)} 法国北部，比利时东南部及卢森堡北部，默兹河的东西两方的高原。
它是第一次及第二次世界大战中重要战役的场所， 1944年十二月和1945年一月在巴尔基战役中引人瞩目

302
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,480
一份关于德国坦克射程的报告
a report on the range of German tanks,

303
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,080
还有一份是关于地面清障的
another on ground clearances.

304
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,320
我感兴趣的恰好是没提到的那些
What interests me is what's not here.

305
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
关于马其诺防线什么也说
Nothing on the Maginot Line.

306
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
{\pos(192,36)} 法国在第一次世界大战后，为防德军入侵而在其东北边境地区构筑的筑垒配系。
以法国陆军部长A．-L．-R．马奇诺的姓氏命名

307
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,800
也没提我们的东境防御系统
Nothing on our defence system on the Eastern Frontier.

308
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,440
要塞 地堡 碉堡都没提到
No forts, no bunkers, no pillboxes.

309
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,440
确实如此 这也证实了我们最担心的事
Exactly. It confirms what we feared most.

310
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
他们开着坦克穿过比利时森林而来
They're coming with tanks through the Belgian forests.

311
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,400
我想这些应该能说服那些不相信的人
Well, this should persuade the unbelievers.

312
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,680
这下我们能应对他们了
Now we'll be ready for them.

313
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,360
Jean-Francois 干得漂亮
You've done well, Jean-Francois.

314
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,844
我已经举荐你
I've recommended that you

315
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:26,280
去总参谋部工作了
take up a position here in General Staff.

316
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,920
我待在华沙已经没有任何意义了
There's nothing to keep me in Warsaw anymore.

317
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,440
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

318
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,000
- 你好   - 可把你盼来了
- Hello.- Finally!

319
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,160
我老哥的热情造访
A visit from my big brother!

320
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
热烈欢迎
Welcome.

321
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
你在这儿干了多久了
How long have you worked here?

322
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,720
有一阵了
A while now.

323
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,240
Etienne也有对私人客户的古董业务
Etienne also deals in art for private clients.

324
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,480
我可以帮你找些精美绝伦的宝贝装点宅邸
I could find you something vibrant and cheerful for the estate.

325
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,360
任何东西都好过那些骑在马背上的祖先们
Anything's better than those gloomy ancestors on horseback.

326
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,704
你很早以前就音讯全无 
I'm so out of touch with you. 

327
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,200
我都不知道你住在哪儿
I don't even know where you live.

328
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
我们住的地方离这就隔着三条街
Oh, we only live three streets away.

329
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,560
你们
We?

330
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,120
我和Armand
Armand and I.

331
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,345
看来我还有些事情不知道 
Something else I didn't know about you. 

332
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,600
Armand是何许人也
What does Armand do?

333
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,181
他在夜总会里弹钢琴 
He plays piano in a nightclub, 

334
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:34,360
所以我想你恐怕不会同意我俩在一起
so you probably won't approve.

335
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,280
- 你不是和那个谁...   - Daniel
- Weren't you with, erm...? - Daniel.

336
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,200
对 我挺喜欢Daniel的 他怎么了
Yes, I rather liked Daniel. What happened to him?

337
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,920
他遇到了一个卖蓝铃花的姑娘
A Bluebell girl happened.

338
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,960
这很荒唐 那姑娘比他还高4英寸
Which is absurd,she's four inches taller than he is.

339
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,440
所以你在Armand身上找慰藉
So you found solace in Armand?

340
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,000
比那正经多了
It's more serious than that.

341
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,800
你上次写信给我的时候你还在恋爱中呢
There was a lady in your life the last time you wrote to me.

342
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,760
我早跟你说了要去追求她
I told you to pursue her.

343
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,320
我追了
I did.

344
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
然后呢
And?

345
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,840
我想我已经失去她了
I think I may have lost her.

346
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
我是Anna Skarbek
Anna Skarbek.

347
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,360
是我
'It's me.'

348
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,840
Jean-Francois 是你吗
Jean-Francois?

349
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,160
你怎么知道我在这儿
'How did you know I was here?'

350
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,600
我打电话给国际联盟  他们最终给了我你的号码
I called the League.They finally gave me a number.

351
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,600
- 你在哪儿   - 我在巴黎
- Where are you? - 'In Paris.'

352
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
我想接你过来住
I want you to live with me here.

353
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,560
我不能这么做
'I can't do that.

354
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,800
我知道Max的事不是你的错
'I know what happened to Max was not your fault.

355
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,960
我当时那么想是因为我被气昏了头
'I thought so at the time because I was angry.'

356
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,120
后来我发现比起自责 责备你要简单得多
Then I realised it was easier to blame you than myself.

357
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
为什么要自责
Blame yourself for what?

358
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,200
我连累了你 所以你们的大使就把他给驱逐出境了
I compromised you, so your Embassy had him expelled.

359
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,040
如果我们没有那段情事的话什么事也不会发生
'None of that would have happened if we hadn't had an affair.'

360
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,360
我们是相爱了!
We fell in love!

361
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,680
Max也是因为我们而死的
And Max is dead because we did.

362
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,000
我没法忘记这点
I can't forget that.

363
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,360
我们在一起的每一刻都会不断提醒着我
'And every moment we spend together would remind me of it.'

364
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,320
我必须得见见你
I have to see you.

365
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
Anna 我需要你
I need you, Anna.

366
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,502
没有我你照样可以活得很好 
You'll survive without me,

367
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:22,880
Jean-Francois
Jean-Francois.

368
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,040
如果我们中的任何人活下来的话
If any of us survive at all.

369
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
鱼子酱
Caviar!

370
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,760
Viktor 看哪 多么奢侈啊
Look, Viktor, such luxury!

371
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,680
你真善良 非常感谢
How kind. Thank you so much.

372
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,760
你们对住的地方还满意吗
Are you comfortable where you live?

373
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,600
他们说称之为安全屋
They call it a safe house,

374
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:22,480
但是坦白地说 它无法给我们安全感
but to be frank, it does not feel safe.

375
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,040
没人保护你们吗
You have no protection?

376
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,560
他们盘问到情报之后就再也没有了
Not since they finished the debriefing.

377
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,600
既然他们已经掌握了想要知道的一切
Now that they have everything they need to know,

378
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
我们就没有利用价值了
we are dispensable.

379
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,680
关于Max Mostov你们跟他们说了些什么
What did you tell them about Max Mostov?

380
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,320
在给莫斯科的报告中未提及的都没说
Nothing that we hadn't already told Moscow in our reports,

381
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,920
有关他的行为和主张
about his behaviour and opinions.

382
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,760
你们听说他被驱逐了吗
You heard he's been deported?

383
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,880
是的 他们为什么要这么做
Yes. Why would they do that?

384
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,840
他一点都不危险
He wasn't dangerous.

385
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,320
你会跟他们反映
Will you remind them, Colonel

386
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,520
我们不应该在一个地方待的太久吗 上校
that we should never stay in one place for too long?

387
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,840
是的 我会的
Yes, I will.

388
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,440
我们现在不是上校关心的对象 Viktor
We are not the Colonel's concern now, Viktor.

389
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
是的 你们是  我保证你们的安全
Yes, you are.I guaranteed your safety.

390
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,920
Mercier 我代表我们所有人
'On behalf of us all, Mercier,'

391
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,015
我们已经迫不及待要祝贺你了
congratulations are certainly in order.

392
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,520
恭喜!  谢谢你们 先生们
Bravo! Thank you, gentlemen.

393
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,400
我很高兴地宣布 
And I am delighted to announce that you are to be promoted

394
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,240
你已被提升为上校
to the rank of full Colonel.

395
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
我很荣幸
I'm honoured.

396
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,160
这是你应得的
No more than you deserve.

397
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,800
我们仔细梳理过那些文件
We've been through the documents with a fine-tooth comb.

398
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,256
- 它们无疑都指向同一个方向 
- They certainly seem to point

399
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:28,440
- 我很高兴您认同我 长官
in one direction. - I'm glad you agree, sir.

400
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,544
当然了
Of course, we do have to

401
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:34,840
我们确实考虑过我们被误导的可能性
consider the possibility that we're being misled.

402
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,240
被误导
Misled?

403
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,480
他好到让人难以置信 不是么
Almost too good to be true, isn't he?

404
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,960
那个特工 叫什么名字来着
This agent - what's his name?

405
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
Johannes Elter
Johannes Elter.

406
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,280
对 Elter
Elter, yes.

407
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,284
我们中的一些人
Yes, it strikes some of us

408
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,000
对你这么轻易就说服他感到很怀疑
as dubious that you persuaded him so easily.

409
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,120
我威胁他如果他不配合 我就将他的事公布于众
I threatened him with exposure if he failed to cooperate.

410
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,953
即使这样 
Even so, 

411
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:58,840
捏造假情报也是这行最常用的伎俩 不是么
disinformation is the oldest game in the world, surely?

412
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,600
要做的事总是和告诉敌人们的相去甚远
Steering your enemy away from your true intention.

413
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,555
我不明白 你把我给你的情报搁在一边
I don't understand.

414
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,920
你把我给你的情报搁在一边
You're disputing the information I've given you

415
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,720
而与此同时你又提拔我 这说不通啊
and at the same time you're promoting me. That makes no sense.

416
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,440
我亲爱的Mercier 你做的工作
My dear Mercier,this work that you've done

417
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,037
提供了一次难能可贵的机会 
has given us an invaluable insight 

418
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:14,000
让我们了解到了IN6的思维方式
into the mentality of IN6.

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,800
这不是思维方式的问题 这就是事实
This is not about mentality,this is about facts!

420
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,160
德国人正计划从比利时入侵法国
The Germans are planning to invade France through Belgium.

421
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,320
这是我目睹了他们的坦克演习之后得出的结论
That was my conclusion after I witnessed their tank manoeuvres.

422
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,720
Elter也证实了这点
Elter confirms it!

423
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,892
如果你忽略了这点 
If you ignore this, 

424
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:35,040
你就是在将我们的国家置于危险之中
you are putting our country in peril!

425
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,120
我们会继续支付给Elter的报酬
We'll continue the payments to Elter

426
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,960
以及其他你精心策划的安排
and the other arrangements that you set up.

427
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,680
但是我们不会改变我们的整个军事策略的
But we do not recommend changing our entire military strategy.

428
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,320
祝你过得愉快 上校
Good day, Colonel.

429
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,640
来杯苏格兰威士忌
Scotch.

430
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,680
不要香槟吗
Not champagne?

431
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,120
我没什么值得庆祝的
I have nothing to celebrate.

432
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,480
你为什么选这个地方
Why did you choose this place?

433
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,488
因为我想让你见见Armand   
Because I want you to meet Armand. 

434
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:26,080
他在哪儿呢
Where is he?

435
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,360
看在上帝的份上 这里只有一个钢琴演奏家
Oh, for God's sake, there's only one piano player.

436
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,200
他年龄太大了不适合你
He's too old for you.

437
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,480
- 他才36   - 太老啦
- He's 36. - Too old!

438
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,320
你为什么情绪那么糟糕
Why are you in such a foul mood?

439
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,160
一言难尽 我的苏格兰威士忌呢
All sorts of reasons. Where's that Scotch?

440
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,080
去吧 摩西
Go down, Moses,

441
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,080
{\pos(192,26)} 出自约翰逊所编歌集《美国黑人圣歌集》中的《去吧，摩西》

442
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,720
去那远方的埃及
Way down in Egypt's land

443
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,360
告诉老法老
Tell old Pharaoh

444
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,840
让我的人民离去
To let my people go

445
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,640
以色列在埃及时
When Israel was in Egypt's land

446
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,440
让我的人民离去
Let my people go

447
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,600
他们无法忍受残酷的压迫
Oppressed so hard they could not stand... 

448
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,800
Angela女士
Lady Angela.

449
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,720
我想我们可以去掉那个"女士"的称呼了
I think we can dispense with "Lady".

450
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,800
我听说你现在待在巴黎 我想为你办场宴会
I hear you're staying in Paris. I'd like to give you a party.

451
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,840
我并不喜欢宴会
I'm not really a party person.

452
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,200
我同样觉得你不是个爱泡夜总会的人
I didn't think you were a nightclub person.

453
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,680
是我妹妹带我来的
My sister brought me.

454
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,240
这么说她不是你生命中的另一半了
Ah,so she isn't the woman in your life.

455
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,685
我听说是有这么一个 
I've heard there is one. 

456
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,600
疯狂的恋人 他们是这么说的
An amour fou, so they say.

457
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,160
不再有了
Not anymore.

458
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,360
天哪 她是不是太年轻了
Oh, dear. Was she too young?

459
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,320
我看上去像是那种专门向年轻女孩下手的男人吗
Do I look like the sort of man who preys on younger women?

460
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,640
这我就不清楚了
I don't know.

461
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,880
你从没暗示过 你喜欢我这把年纪的女人
You've given no hint that you prey on women of my age.

462
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,960
或许我从来都不懂女人
Perhaps I don't understand women of any age.

463
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,120
你有点醉了 Jean-Francois
You're a little drunk,Jean-Francois.

464
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,200
你觉得你能摇摇晃晃地走到波拿巴路吗
Do you think you could stagger as far as the Rue Bonaparte?

465
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,560
那是什么地方
What's there?

466
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,400
我住的地方
My apartment.

467
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
让我的人民离开
Let my people go. 

468
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,360
醒酒生鸡蛋 从未失效过
Prairie oyster, never fails.

469
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
什么从未失效
Never fails to what?

470
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,720
提神醒脑的  乖乖把它喝完
Clear your head. Drink it down like a good boy.

471
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,680
昨晚上我情绪很糟糕 我喝多了
Last night I was in a strange mood. I drank too much.

472
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,969
Jean-Francois 我们在那家夜店里纵酒狂欢
Oh, Jean-Francois, we had

473
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,240
然后我们就上床了
fun in a boozy nightclub and then we fucked.

474
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,920
没有什么比那个更复杂了 你有什么计划吗
It's nothing more complicated than that. What are your plans?

475
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,600
我要请一段停薪假
I'm taking unpaid leave.

476
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,480
是时候回我的私宅里住住了
I've neglected my estate too long.

477
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,120
我们得保持联系
We must stay in touch.

478
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,800
我想我们能为国家做点什么
I think we can be of use to our countries.

479
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,360
我都不知道我的国家是不是认为我有用
I don't know if my country feels I'm any use at all.

480
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,440
那是因为Lessard以及半个总参谋部的人
Well, that's because Lessard and half your general staff

481
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,600
都和法兰西行动的一群法西斯分子在一起
are with that bunch of fascists in the Action Francaise.

482
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,600
{\pos(192,26)} "法兰西行动"是法国的法西斯组织

483
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,880
他们希望法国和德国亲密无间
They want France in bed with Germany.

484
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,800
能让他们远离红色恐怖的东西都行
Anything that buffers them from the red menace.

485
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,280
在英国有很多傻子也是这么想的
We have plenty of idiots in England who feel the same way.

486
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
我去煮咖啡
I'll make coffee.

487
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,320
我们应该好好照顾Rozen一家
We were supposed to look after the Rozens.

488
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,800
我们确实这么做的 我们给了他们钱和房子
We did. We gave them money, an apartment.

489
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,960
他们希望能有点安全感
They expected to live in some degree of safety,

490
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,600
不用害怕走在大街上
not afraid to walk down the street.

491
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,720
你要我批准什么 直说吧
So you'd have me sanction what, precisely?

492
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,200
提供一队保镖全天候保护他们
24-hour protection with a team of bodyguards

493
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,640
就为了一对老不中用的布尔什维克吗
for a couple of tired old Bolsheviks?

494
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,600
他们把知道的一切告诉了我们
They gave us everything they knew.

495
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,477
当他们这么做的时候 
And when they did, 

496
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:26,000
他们就知道以后的生活会是什么样的
they knew the life they were getting into.

497
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,840
光天化日之下被枪击? 那就是职业风险
A bullet in broad daylight? Occupational hazard.

498
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
我们是不是该感激俄国人差劲的枪法呢
Should be grateful the Russians can't shoot straight.

499
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:54,753
阿尔萨斯

500
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
多么讽刺啊 Viktor
How ironic, Viktor,

501
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,905
那个顽固的共产主义者
that die-hard communists

502
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:20,520
竟然在资本主义的光辉下安享晚年
should end up living in bourgeois splendour.

503
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,240
才不是呢 搞情报的可不怎么光彩
Nah, there's nothing very splendid about the plumbing.

504
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,675
Fernand 
Fernand, 

505
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:25,920
这是Viktor Rozen和他的太太Malka
this is Viktor and Malka Rozen.

506
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,920
- 他们要待多长时间 先生  - 不一定
- How long will they be staying, Monsieur? - Not sure.

507
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,920
替我盯着点村子里 田里的陌生人
Be on guard for strangers in the village, in the field.

508
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
因为我们的访客们吗
Because of our visitors?

509
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,080
我懂的
I understand.

510
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,960
谢谢你
Thank you.

511
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,720
我哥哥不接电话也不回信
My brother won't take phone calls or answer my letters.

512
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
你们吵架了
You have a fight?

513
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
没有
No.

514
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
他夫人死的时候他就这样子
He was like this when his wife died.

515
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,360
他跑到那个阴暗的地方待了好久
He went into this dark place and stayed there for a long time.

516
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,600
我觉得我们得去看看他
I'd like us to visit him.

517
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,680
哎 看见我没法让他的情绪有所改善
Well, seeing me won't improve his mood.

518
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,120
我不喜欢乡下 我不喜欢狗
I don't like the country. I don't like dogs.

519
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,800
我弹爵士钢琴而且我一天抽40根烟
I play jazz piano and I smoke 40 Gauloises a day.

520
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,960
求你了 就当是为了我
Please, do this for me.

521
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,840
你为什么不来看我
Why haven't you been to see me?

522
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,280
是因为华沙的夜生活很迷人吗
Is the night life of Warsaw so enticing?

523
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
我没在华沙常住 妈妈
I haven't been in Warsaw, Mother.

524
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,560
你就是没办法安定下来 不是吗
Hmm. You can't settle anywhere, can you?

525
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,280
这让我觉得你不快乐
Which makes me think you're unhappy.

526
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
我的工作很重要
My work is important.

527
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,200
我从来都没真正弄明白你的工作到底是什么
I've never quite understood what it is.

528
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,560
这颜色适合我吗
Is this my colour?

529
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
当然
Of course it is.

530
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,080
我觉得你应该需要它
I thought you might need it.

531
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,880
我知道你怕冷
I know how you feel the cold.

532
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
他们会把它偷走的
They'll steal it.

533
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,400
不 他们不会
No, they won't.

534
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,104
你的那位军官朋友怎么样了  
How's your officer? 

535
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,960
你说他不是波兰人
He's not Polish, you said.

536
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,560
法国人
French.

537
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,720
你那位法国人是位绅士吗
Your Frenchman's a gentleman?

538
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,640
他再也不是我的男人了
He's not my gentleman anymore.

539
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,818
抱歉 请问你是谁
I'm sorry ,who are you?

540
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,984
我是Armand 钢琴演奏家 
I'm Armand. The piano player. 

541
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:05,400
顺便说一句 你的钢琴该调一调音了
And yours needs tuning, by the way.

542
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,160
啊 你是Gabrielle的朋友
Oh, you're Gabrielle's friend.

543
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,080
不止如此 上校
A little more than that, Colonel.

544
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,880
你在这儿干嘛 为什么我不知道你要来
What are you doing here? Why didn't I know you were coming?

545
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,720
因为你一直找借口对我们避而不见
Because you'd have found some excuse not to see us.

546
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,040
你最近过得好吗
How are you?

547
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,440
你看起来很糟糕
You look terrible.

548
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,640
James Joyce说
James Joyce said that

549
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,160
爱尔兰是唯一一个从未迫害过犹太人的国家
Ireland is the only country that has never persecuted the Jews.

550
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,800
你知道为什么吗
Do you know why?

551
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,600
不知道 为什么
No, why?

552
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,600
因为他们不让犹太人入境
Because they never let them in!

553
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,480
越来越多的犹太人跑到巴黎来了
More and more Jewish people are coming to Paris.

554
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,661
很多人到我的店里来
Many of them come to my stall,

555
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:56,280
试着卖些画和珠宝
trying to sell paintings, jewellery.

556
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,240
当他们变卖家当的时候 
And when they've sold them, 

557
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,320
他们打算又何去何从呢
where do they plan to go? Hmm?

558
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,800
巴勒斯坦?  或是美国?
Palestine? America?

559
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,240
我没有古董可卖
I don't have an art collection to sell.

560
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,280
我想我可以在远洋轮船上弹钢琴
I guess I could always play piano on an ocean liner

561
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,360
如果战争爆发 就在哈瓦那弃船登陆
if the war breaks out, jump ship in Havana.

562
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,524
你可以到赌场里弹琴 
You could play in a casino 

563
00:43:12,524 --> 00:43:14,880
而我则做个卖香烟的女郎
and I'll be the cigarette girl.

564
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,320
老天啊 你们两个 严肃点儿
For God's sake, you two, be serious.

565
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,396
这种我们所拥有的 所热爱的生活 
This life we have, this life we love, 

566
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:23,080
你们都认为是理所当然
you take for granted.

567
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,640
但这一切都会消散  就是那样
It could all vanish. Just like that.

568
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,360
那你有什么好建议呢
So what do you suggest?

569
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,800
我们要每天都生活在对未来的恐惧中么
We live every day afraid of tomorrow?

570
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,120
我们就是这么熬过来的
That's how we were living.

571
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,640
现在好一点了 多亏了你哥哥
A little less now, thanks to your brother.

572
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,560
至少我们知道明天会是怎样
At least be aware of what tomorrow might be.

573
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,440
人们表现的就好像最坏的境况永远不会发生
People act as though the worst will never happen.

574
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,360
这就是你的做法吧
That's just how you act yourself.

575
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,040
你怎么能这么说
How can you say that?

576
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,080
你什么都不做
You don't do anything about anything.

577
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,040
除了喝遍父亲酒窖里的藏酒
Apart from drink your way through Father's cellar.

578
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,280
你觉得你父亲会介意我们 呃 再喝一瓶
Do you think your father would mind if we, er, drank another one?

579
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,360
请便
Help yourself.

580
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,400
恕我离席告退了
If you'll excuse me.

581
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,800
晚安
Good night.

582
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,080
- 晚安   - 晚安
- Good night.  - Good night.

583
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,840
Emile看见了他们两个
Emile saw the pair of them.

584
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,480
正在开车向南边草地的树林而去
Driving up to the woods above the south meadow.

585
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,080
就是你给我说过的那两个
The two you described to me.

586
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,960
你待在这儿
You stay here.

587
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,400
当然了 长官
Of course, sir.

588
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,720
上校要上哪儿去
Where's the Colonel going?

589
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,720
今天晚饭时我们就知道了
We'll find out at dinner tonight.

590
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,640
我们需要铁锹
We need shovels.

591
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,720
都怪我
I blame myself.

592
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,080
苏联方面知道你们在华沙联系的人是我
The Soviets knew it was me you approached in Warsaw.

593
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,160
他们迟早会把这些联系起来的
They were bound to make the connection sooner or later.

594
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,920
所以那些来的人...?
So these men who came...?

595
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,280
我都处理好了
I've dealt with that situation.

596
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,359
Fernand开他们的车去里昂了  
Fernand is driving their car to Lyon. 

597
00:46:58,359 --> 00:46:59,680
然后在某处弃车
He'll dump it somewhere.

598
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,880
那我们呢
And us?

599
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,400
我昨晚已经和巴黎方面说过了 今早又谈了一次
I spoke to Paris last night and again this morning.

600
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,990
你们将要前往布列塔尼
You're going to Brittany,

601
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,600
显然 那是一个可爱的小山村 还靠着海
a pretty village, apparently, on the sea.

602
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,040
我会把你们送到巴黎
I'll drive you as far as Paris.

603
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,680
你也会一起离开么
You're leaving too?

604
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,280
是的  我妹妹说得对
Yes. My sister's right.

605
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,400
我在这儿不问世事的时间够久了
I've been buried here for too long.

606
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,120
我给你买了这个
I brought you these.

607
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,400
噢
Oh.

608
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
我还以为会是松露巧克力呢
I was rather hoping for truffles.

609
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,960
难道它们不是在你那一带出产的么
Don't they come from your neck of the woods?

610
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,440
看起来你并不需要它们  你怎么了
You don't look like you need them. What was it?

611
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,680
胆结石  怎么就得上胆结石了
Gallstones. How on earth does one get gallstones?

612
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,800
跟鹅肝和熟食打交道打了50年   
50 years of foie gras and charcuterie?  

613
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,040
胡说
Rubbish.

614
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,600
你来这儿干什么
So why are you here?

615
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,360
我得去工作 将军
I need to go to work, General.

616
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,320
我得回归这场博弈
I need to get back in the game.

617
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,480
最近 我们与波兰人在他们遭遇入侵的事件上
Recently, we reached an agreement with the Poles

618
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,680
达成了共识
in the event of their being invaded.

619
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,280
我们在讨论的是一项非常危险的任务
We're talking about a very dangerous mission.

620
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,200
这关乎他们的国家主权与未来的长期生存
It's essential to their sovereignty and long-term survival.

621
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,520
这件事目前只有若干最高级别的人知情
It's only known to a few at the highest possible level.

622
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,200
我本来派了一个人两天后出发
I had a man leaving in two days.

623
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,080
但你更了解波兰人  你能代替他
But you know the Poles better. You can replace him.

624
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,560
多谢了
Thank you.

625
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,391
我希望能够了解近几个月来
I'd like to see whatever

626
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:27,040
你从Elter那里得到的情况 不论那是什么
you've received from Elter in the last few months.

627
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,880
最近都是些无聊事
Rather dull reading recently,

628
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,560
不过我会和Lessard安排一下的
but I'll arrange it with Lessard.

629
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,800
当你从华沙回来后 我就该出院了
And when you get back from Warsaw, I'll be out of this place

630
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,840
我们就可以享用一顿异常美好的午餐
and we can enjoy a really good lunch.

631
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,360
你的医生同意么
Will your doctors allow it?

632
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,040
我才不邀请他们
I won't invite them.

633
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,268
那么 你认为你可以从这儿找出
So, you think you can find

634
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,640
一些被我们遗漏的东西 是么
things in here that we missed, is that it?

635
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,981
并非如此  我只是想重新
Not at all. I just want to

636
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:51,200
了解形式  已经有一段时间了
get back in the picture. It's been a while.

637
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,680
然而你却你就要去执行我等凡人
And yet you're off on a high-priority mission

638
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,960
眼中的最高优先级任务了
which is classified to us mere mortals.

639
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,280
我了解波兰  我有线人和关系网
I know Poland. I have contacts and connections.

640
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,840
并且Beauvilliers会支持你的
And Beauvilliers behind you.

641
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,200
如果战争爆发了任务便不会持续多长时间
That won't last long if war breaks out.

642
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,080
你也说了是 如果
You still say "If".

643
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,440
我在这儿安排了一场会议
I've set the meeting in here.

644
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,440
你以前的公寓还是空的 所以你还可以住在那儿
Your old apartment's empty so you can stay there.

645
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,720
不过 恐怕没有管家了
No housekeeper, I'm afraid.

646
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,440
你能和我们待多久
How long will you be with us?

647
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,120
也许是两天
Two days, perhaps.

648
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,240
噢 真可惜  没了你可就什么都不同了
Oh, what a shame. It's not the same without you.

649
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,040
你后来和Anna联系了吗
Have you been in touch with Anna?

650
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,880
目前她在纽约
She's in New York at the moment.

651
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,154
纽约  天呐
New York! Goodness.

652
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:46,240
国联在世界博览会上有一个展馆
The League has a pavilion at the World's Fair.

653
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,720
噢 Mercier  阴魂不散 嗯?
Ah, Mercier! Couldn't stay away, huh?

654
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,120
呃 你希望我在这场会议里出席么
Erm, do you want me to sit in on this meeting?

655
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,360
真谢谢你 那无关紧要
Thank you, that won't be necessary.

656
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,280
啊 我知道  那么你没什么需要的了
Ah, I see. So there's nothing that you need?

657
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,880
来杯咖啡还是很不错的
Coffee would be nice.

658
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,080
显然 德军会从西边进攻
Obviously the Germans will attack from the west,

659
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,880
所以我们的路线得是东南方 进入罗马尼亚
so our route has to be south-east, into Romania.

660
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,960
我们的外交部已经向布加勒斯特提议了
Our Foreign Ministry has already made overtures with Bucharest.

661
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,960
{\pos(192,26)} Bucharest 罗马尼亚首都

662
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,280
将会有一艘货轮出现在黑海的康斯坦察
There'll be a freighter at Constanza on the Black Sea.

663
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,787
升着中立的旗子
It will fly a neutral flag

664
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:19,280
但是配有法国船员和一艘武装的护卫舰
but have a French crew and an armed escort.

665
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,800
货物经由马赛
It will take the consignment to Marseilles.

666
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,880
最终抵达苏黎世
Ultimate destination - Zurich.

667
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,400
我希望你是那个监守全程的人
I want you to be the person who sees it through.

668
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,360
我会的
I'll insist on it.

669
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,880
当然 我希望永远不要走到这一步
Of course, I hope it never comes to this.

670
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,360
我们都知道这不可避免
We both know it will.

671
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,720
我上次在这儿的时候
When I was last here,

672
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,573
我得到了一个促使我在
I got a tip that led to

673
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:49,120
柏林的IN6里插入一个线人的暗示
me setting up an informant in IN6 in Berlin.

674
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,600
有什么想和我说的么
Anything to share with me?

675
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,880
你不会想知道的
You wouldn't want it.

676
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,640
在最后的两天我一直都在整理所有最新的材料
I've been over all the recent material in the last two days.

677
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,000
我认为材料有问题
I think it's tainted.

678
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,880
Lapp博士在华沙么
Is Doctor Lapp in Warsaw?

679
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,120
他在  怎么了
He is. Why?

680
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,600
Lapp就是那个给了我暗示的人
It was Lapp who gave me the tip.

681
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,280
恐怕自我们上次见面后
The world has not improved

682
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,280
这世道仍旧一点儿都没改变

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,850
噢 我亲爱的姑娘 
Oh, my dear girl, 

818
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,920
波兰现在时局很糟糕 非常糟
what a terrible time for Poland, terrible.

819
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,680
您怎么来了
What are you doing here?

820
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,520
Mercier上校让我来接你
Colonel Mercier asked me to meet you.

821
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,967
他大概一天之内会到华沙
He should be in Warsaw in

822
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:51,400
他不顾一切地要见你
a day or so and he's desperate to see you.

823
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,040
我不想看到他
I don't wish to see him.

824
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,320
在你听了他让我告诉你的事情后
I think you might, my dear,

825
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:58,720
你也许就不会这么想了
when you hear what he's asked me to tell you.

826
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,120
是关于Max的
It's about Max.

827
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,760
Malka 我们会永远活在恐惧之中
Malka, we will always be afraid.

828
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,240
无论是作为叛逃者还是犹太人
Either as defectors or Jews.

829
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,600
我们身边的都是陌生人
We live among strangers.

830
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,800
不知道谁会第一个将矛头指向我们
Who knows who will be the first to point the finger?

831
01:01:39,728 --> 01:01:46,282
这样我们就能在一起了 永远在一起
This way we will be together, always.

832
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,440
很高兴见到你 上校

我也是 Marek 这边情况怎么样
You too, Marek. What's the mood here?

834
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,800
所有40岁以下的人必须响应召集令
Everyone under 40 has to collect call-up papers.

835
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,848
加上所有的预备役军人和退伍军人   
Plus all reservists and ex-soldiers. 

836
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:21,800
你不是吗
Not you?

837
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,640
上校想让我跟着你做这个任务
The Colonel wants me on this assignment you're on.

838
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,040
他不会告诉我是什么
He won't tell me what it is.

839
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,320
你要我做什么
What do you want from me?

840
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,766
首先 从现在起
First, your silence about

841
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:44,080
对你的一切所见所闻保持沉默

842
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,800
我要你撤掉车厢内所有的座位

and the floorboards taken up to make room for some crates.

844
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,120
明早之前我要车上恢复原状
Everything needs to be back in place by tomorrow morning.

845
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,840
是军火吗
Is it ammunition?

846
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,040
我是说 我要知道这个东西是不是随时会爆炸
I mean, I need to know if this thing could blow up at any minute.

847
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,280
我不能告诉你是什么
I can't tell you what it is.

848
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,240
我还要驾驶?
And I'm supposed to drive it?

849
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,200
你不就是干这个的嘛
That's what you do, isn't it?

850
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,880
干了40年了 没错
For 40 years, yes.

851
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,280
这还是原定的计划吗
Was this the original plan?

852
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,920
自从那些混蛋出其不意地占领我们之后 一切都变了
Everything's changed since those bastards took us by surprise.

853
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,880
我们只得随机应对
We're improvising.

854
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,760
我们什么时候走
So when will we leave?

855
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,120
一大早走
Not before morning.

862

是的
Yes.

863
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,400

德国坦克向波兰进发

And Stalin has 40 divisions on our eastern border.

867
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,320

They'll bomb the airfields first. Then telephone exchanges.

868
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,400
你们什么时候离开

869
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,840
我们在等巴黎的消息 你一直都是对的
We're waiting for Paris to tell us. You were right all along.

870

我见过她了 我把Max的事告诉她了

我要见她 她在哪

她去乡下陪她母亲了

878

为什么把我带到到这么可怕的地方

你被指控为间谍 Lapp博士

Mercier上校
Colonel Mercier.

That's outrageous.

883
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,680
他没有证据

884
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,880
我们不需要证据

我们并不是在监禁你

我们是根据紧急权力法拘留你

887

根本没有这种东西!
There's no such thing!

888

这是我们将要被敌对外国势力
It's what we enact when we're

889

这比塞满了人的火车还要重

我们不用很快的速度
We don't need to be fast,

899
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,800
只要看起来像普通列车就行

900

914
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,520
那个地方叫博雷克

And if you jeopardise it, I'll see you are court-martialled.

我会回到火车上的

926
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,080
死在爱人的怀里 这对你算是慰藉吗

我来接你 Anna

你在内疚与泪水中荒废了一年

我本以为Max是需要拯救的灵魂

950
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,120
那都是欺骗你的 我一直很想念你
It was all a deception. I've missed you.

951
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,560
你最好还是把我引见给你的母亲吧

We have to pick up a train 20 kilometres from here.

961
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,240

So be as quick as you can, take as little as you need.

我没有去巴黎穿的衣服

966

又是新的潮流了 可你必须要走 Anna
It will be all new fashions. You must go, Anna.

967

他没有停

976
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:25,720
那辆车 是他的车 上校

982
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,240
好了 走吧
OK, let's go.

983

而且我可能再也见不到我的家人了

1000

你要相信你会见到他们的

1004

停下来 别跑
Stop! Stop!

1016
01:18:50,365 --> 01:18:51,142
别开枪

1017
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:52,526

你不用付我钱的
You don't have to pay me.

1035

01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,480
我在铁路公司工作

1040
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,830
你看起来不像铁路工人啊
You don't look like railroad worker.

1041
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:35,920
火车上有什么值钱的东西吗

为什么不呢
Why not?

1045

把那块表给我

1050
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,480
你在铁路公司上班怎么可能有这个
You don't get this working for railroad.

1051
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,440
你看那下面干什么

1052
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,600
你还好吗
Are you all right?

1053

1054
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,920
他们走不了了
they're not going anywhere.

1055
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,160
对不起 他们逼我的
I'm sorry. They make me.

1056
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,880
为什么我们不在野外的小屋定居下来
Why don't we settle in a cabin in the wild -

1057
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,280
一口井 养几只山羊
a well, a few goats

1058
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,000
远离这场战争
and hundreds of miles from the war?

1059
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,480
我还要几只狗 几本书
I'd need dogs. And some books.

1060
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,960
还有一个好酒窖

1061
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,440
我还会学会缝纫
And I'd learn to sew.

1062
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,880
我们到哪了
Where are we anyway?

1063
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,040
明天我们会抵达边界
We'll reach the border tomorrow.

1064
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,160
然后?
And then?

1065
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,360
我不会再让你离开我的视线
I'll never let you out of my sight.

1066
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,760
可能四到五周内到法国 我们就结婚
Could be in France in four or five weeks, we'll get married.

1067
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,760
如果你要我成为一个体面的女人
If you want to make a respectable woman of me,

1068
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,360
恐怕太晚了
I'm afraid you're too late.

1069
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,600
我还可以试试
I can still try.

1070
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,080
跟预想的一样
Looks like we're expected.

1071
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,048
如果跟罗马尼亚人的交涉得不错的话 
If it goes well with the Romanians, 

1072
01:25:46,048 --> 01:25:47,320
之后的就全由你做主了
the rest is up to you.

1073
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,120
退一步说 未来充满了不确定
The future is uncertain, to say the least.

1074
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,040
无论发生什么 你们俩要共同面对
Whatever it may be, you two face it together.

1075
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,440
现在该怎么办
What now?

1076
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,360
竭尽所能活下来
We do our best to stay alive.

1077
01:27:31,906 --> 01:27:36,410
1939年12月 
150万德国军队涌入波兰

1078
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:43,691
波兰的黄金储备经过罗马尼亚
通过土耳其和黎巴嫩
于10月到达巴黎

1079
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:50,275
