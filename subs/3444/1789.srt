我看到了一个可怕的男人
I saw a scary man.

10
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,190
既不是命运也不是现实
Neither fate nor society

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,160
允许弗朗西斯?穆里根
put Francis Mulligan  in the house

12
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,930
就在15日晚上 闯入凯莱?米切尔的家

13
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,400
既不是命运也不是现实
Neither fate nor society

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,900
叫他把她绑起来  用枪指着她
told him to tie her up,  shove a gun in her face

15
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,710
窃取她的财物
and steal her belongings.

16
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,280
那是他自己的选择
That was his choice.

17
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,950
辩方还会站在被告一方么
The defense would have you  walk in his client's shoes.

18
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,260

没人说它不是  可...
Nobody's saying  it's not, but...

22
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,540
我就是来自那里 不是我是谁
that's where I'm from.  It's not who I am.

23
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,480
他不是受害者
He is not the victim here.

24
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,250
所以 如果你们要站在任何一方...
So if you are gonna put yourself in anyone's shoes...

25
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,890
请...

昨晚一场似乎普通的交通意外

演变成可怕的谋杀案的调查

警员发现车后门附近鲜血淋漓

We've got the bloody tools and the  plastic sheets in the back of his van.

212
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,780
你们需要决定  是否足以定罪

关于4日晚

如果你能回答  尽可能准确回答

你会是我的检控官

你没有什么就不用担心
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

235
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,600
好吧  戴维斯先生
Okay, Mr. Davis,

236
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,970
我们开始  告诉我们当晚早些时候
let's start with you telling us where you were

237
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,980
你在哪里
earlier that evening.

238
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,510
下班以后  我去了某个团体
Left work, went to group,

239
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,480
然后开车去兜风
went for a drive.

240
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,980
什么团体
Group?

241
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,880
是啊  我在一些互助团体帮忙

242
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,460
-开车去了哪  -只是去我想去的地方
-And the drive?  -Just something I do.

243
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,720
这不违法吧 对不对
It's not against  the law, right?

244
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,930
我的意思是 难道你们晚上不出去或者开车周边转转
I mean, don't you ever go out and drive around at night?

245
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,330
恕我直言 这是题外话
Due respect, I think that's beside the point.

246
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,640
我不喜欢总呆在家里
I don't like to spend too much time at home.

247
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,470
这会唤起我许多回忆
It brings back memories-

248
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,640
我的妻子和孩子
My wife and child.

249
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,280
嗯  我懂
Uh, yes.

250
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,350
我听说过关于你家人的事
I heard what happened  to your family.

251
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,650
我 我很抱歉
I'm-I'm sorry.

252
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,520
伊曼纽尔?费莱 枪杀的第二天晚上
Emanuel fryer. Gunned down the next night

253
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,560
袭击了另外的家庭
attacking someone else's family.

254
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,330
关于受害者我们还知道些什么
What do we know  about the victim?

255
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,600
塞西尔?阿克曼  登记在案的性犯罪者和
Cecil Ackerman-registered sex offender;

256
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,070

two counts of child sex abuse; Did two years inside;

257
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,070
三个月前假释
was only out on parole three months.

258
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,700
所以是一个真正混混
So a real loss to society.

259
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,440
到目前为止 他和戴维斯之间没找到联系
So far there's no connection between him and Davis.

260
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,040
-凶手用的什么凶器  -武器
-What about the murder weapon?  -Weapons.

261
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,610
死因法医也不能确定
The coroner couldn't be exact,

262
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,550
但他认为这些伤口可能是同一作案工具造成
but he suggested these  wounds could be consistent

263
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,050
用的某一种工具或者机器零件
with the type of tools and machine parts

264
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,080
在戴维斯的面包车后备箱里找到
found in the back of Davis's van.

265
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,050
-确定  -是的 他们还发现
-Could be?  -Well, they also found

266
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,320
可见的油污和伤口里的沙子
significant amounts of oil and grit in the wounds,

267
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,460
这证实了戴维斯的肇事逃逸事实
which corroborates Davis's hit-and-run story.

268
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,360
事实上  维克的D.N.A.和血液
True, but the Vic's  D.N.A. And blood were

269
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
遍布戴维斯的衣服 他的面包车里也有
all over Davis's clothes, inside his van.

270
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,700
就是那辆 他把阿克曼抬入的面包车
Which could've got there when he lifted Ackerman into his van.

271
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,930
是啊  或许他杀害了他  戴维斯就有两项罪名
Yeah, or when he murdered him. Davis has two counts

272
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,730
暴力攻击 而他的家人
-of aggravated assault.  -At a time when his family

273
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,700
在反抗入侵的时候 恰好被谋杀
had just been murdered in a home invasion.

274
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,940
他还没有过这么多停车票
He hasn't had so much as a parking ticket since.

275
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,770
什么困扰着你 米奇
What's bothering you, Mitch?

276
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,610
我看不出动机
I don't see motive.

277
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,410
刚拿到的音频文件
Just got this audio file.

278
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,080
这是复制本
Here's the transcript.

279
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,650
这是个911报警电话  有人报告了事故
It was a 911 call. Somebody called in an accident

280
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
20分钟后 也就是戴维斯被捕前
20 minutes before Davis was picked up.

281
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,420
救护车到达事发地点
By the time the ambulance arrived at the location,

282
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,590
现场一个人也没有
there was no one there.

283
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,500
好的  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

284
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,130
我们有什么办法找到报案者
Is there any way we can find the caller?

285
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,070
-没有 他用的是公用电话  -你怎么知道的
-No, he used a payphone.  -How do you know that?

286
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,440
动动脑子 他会在录音电话中留下姓名么
If he used his cell, it would have his name, phone records.

287
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
很好  这是911电话的潜在漏洞
Okay, 911 call's  potentially damaging,

288
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,380
但它不是决定性的
but it's not conclusive.

289
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,150
如果我们不能找到来电者
And if we can't find  the caller,

290
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,480
辨方也找不到
defense probably can't either.

291
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,750
这可能是在芝加哥任何一人
Could be anyone in Chicago.

292
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,920
米奇  那天晚上你在哪里
Mitch, where were you that evening?

293
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,390
-不  米奇醉得话都说不清了
-No, Mitch couldn't string a sentence together

294
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,030
-那晚怎么了 米奇
-that night, right, Mitch?

295
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,660
-是的 谢谢 斯图  -如果这是肇事逃逸
-Yeah, thanks, Stu.  -If it was a hit-and-run,

296
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,930
那就需要那个肇事者
all it takes is for the guy who hit him

297
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,670
主动承认 否则我们还会陷入僵局
to come forward and confess, and we're dead in the water.

298
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,510
某个人可能这样做 是吧
What's the likelihood of anybody doing that, huh?

299
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,540
我们能找到足够证据来定罪
Do we have enough for a conviction?

300
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,510
戴维斯被发现时 死者就在他的面包车里
Davis was found with a dead man in his van.

301
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
我们有大量物证
We have a ton of physical evidence.

302
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,880
没有不在场证明 有暴力犯罪史
No alibi, a documented history of violence

303
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,490
他的公设辩护人太嫩了
and his public defender's still in diapers.

304
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,590
米奇能轻松搞定
Mitch will eat him for breakfast.

305
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,900
先以谋杀罪一项控告他
Charge him, murder one.

306
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,140
是您做的尸检吧  医生
You examined  the body, doctor.

307
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,510
以您的的专业判断
In your professional...  opinion,

308
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,010
死因是什么
what was the cause of death?

309
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,980
颅骨钝力外伤
Blunt force trauma  to the skull.

310
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,920
那又是什么原因造成的创伤
And what caused that trauma?

311
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,220
死者的头骨的后面完全粉碎
The back of the skull was badly crushed,

312
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,720
所以很难缩小作案工具的种类
so it's hard to narrow it down to any one item,

313
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,860
但有些痕迹
but some of the marks seemed consistent

314
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,560
与在嫌疑人的面包车发现的锤子
with a hammer found in the suspect's van.

315
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,030
及覆盖在内饰上油脂和机油似乎是一致的
And the interior was covered  in grease and motor oil,

316
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,940
所以某种在这种环境中暴力的挣扎
so any type of violent  struggle in that environment

317
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,040
可能也引发那些伤口并留下明显痕迹
could've also caused those wounds and left that trace evidence.

318
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,740
你说 "似乎是一致的 "
You said, "seemed consistent."

319
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,910
是的
That's correct.

320
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,750
您报告中提到的创伤
Your report talks of abrasions

321
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,090
润滑脂和机油已浸入伤口
and impact wounds with grease  and motor oil in them.

322
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,990
现在 我敢肯定的说
Now the defense I'm sure is gonna argue that-

323
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,930
那些伤口明显是
those wounds indicate

324
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,530
一辆汽车辗过塞西尔?阿克曼造成
that a car ran over Cecil Ackerman

325
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,970
正如被告的证词所说
as per the defendant's testimony

326
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,500
剩下的只是...
and that the rest is just...

327
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,640
并不支持的证据
a misinterpretation of the evidence.

328
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,540
我问完了 法官大人
No more questions, your honor.

329
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,120
这里是911 您发生了什么紧急情况
911, what's your emergency?

330
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,250
我需要一辆救护车
I need an ambulance.

331
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,290
-一位男士被车撞了  -事发地点在哪  先生
-A guy's been hit by a car.  -What's the location, sir?

332
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,260
呃  基勒  基勒和第26大街拐角
Uh, Keeler. Keeler and 26th.

333
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,990
你叫什么名字  先生
What's your name, sir?

334
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,730
请快点
Please just hurry.

335
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,960
-快点  他受了重伤  -先生
-Hurry, he's hurt real bad.  -Sir.

336
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,240
这是你的证人 布诺克顿先生
It's your witness, Mr. Brockden.

337
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,250
医生  陪审团对你的专业上的问题感到陌生
Doctor, the jury will be unfamiliar  with your field of expertise,

338
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,320
所以我会问一个相当简单的问题
so I'll ask  quite a simple question.

339
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,750
就是法医语言学究竟有多准确
Just how accurate is forensic linguistics?

340
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,290
-非常准确  -但它不是绝对的
-Extremely.  -But it's not perfect?

341
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,690
对科学来说不存在绝对
Perfection doesn't happen in science.

342
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,800
好吧 就算十分之一吧  那么
Okay. On a sliding scale of one to 10 then-

343
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,630
您可以反对  律师先生
you may want to object, counselor.

344
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,870
我反对 证人不在现场
The witness's field  is not on trial here.

345
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,340
这个问题我问完了 法官大人
I'll withdraw the question, your honor.

346
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,010
您刚才说 您认为
You stated earlier that you believe

347
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,680
来电者是真实的
the caller to be genuine?

348
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,880
因此 我假设您的意思
By this I assume you mean

349
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
他报告的是一个真实存在的
he was reporting  a real accident.

350
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,010
正确
Correct.

351
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,320
你能这么说  只是...
And you can tell this just by...

352
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,690
凭他的声音就可以断定
hearing his voice?

353
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,190
它其实很复杂  但这是肯定的
It's more complicated than that, but yes.

354
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,130
您可以为我们描述下来电者么
What else can you tell us about the caller?

355
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,000
很难肯定
Hard to be certain

356
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,360
从磁带上的声音判断
from the quality of the tape.

357
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,000
听起来是一个白人男性 可能在30多岁
Sounded like a white male-possibly in his 30s-

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,840
来自芝加哥南部
from the South of Chicago,

359
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,800
但他尽力掩饰口音
but he's tried hard to soften the accent,

360
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,670
不象您 律师先生
not unlike yourself,counselor.

361
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,140
您来自哪里 里弗代尔
Now you're from where, Riverdale?

362
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,910
你说 你很难 告诉某些...
When you say it's hard  to tell for certain...

363
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,910
这磁带是不清楚的
that the tape is unclear,

364
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,350
它听起来 是一个白人男性
that it seems to be a white male-

365
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,920
来自底层的种族
The underlying ethnicity

366
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,720
这个很难完全瞒过受过专业训练的耳朵
is hard to fully hide  from trained ears.

367
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,690
-是的 又一个好记录  -嗯
-Yes, it's a good recording.  -Uh-huh.

368
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,630
-好的  谢谢  -谢谢你了
-Okay, thank you.  -Thank you too.

369
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,340
-嘿  -员工会议五点开始
-Hey.  -Staff meeting starts in five.

370
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,080
一个不愿留下姓氏叫吉米的 给您来过电话
Someone named Jimmy called,  wouldn't leave a last name.

371
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,710
说是 他出来了 想要见你
Said to tell you he's out and wants to see you.

372
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,910
留下了联系电话 要发您的手机上
Left a contact number. Do you want  me to get him on the phone for you?

373
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,750
不 不用 谢谢你
No no no, thank you.

374
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,890
闻到了吗
Smell that?

375
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,360
这就是自由的味道
That's the smell of freedom.

376
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,730
嘿  那天我给你家去过电话
Hey, so I called your house the other day,

377
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,340
你知道  找过你的
you know, looking for ya.

378
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,170
你的妻子...
Your wife...

379
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,710
她不知道我是谁  是吗
she doesn't know who I am, does she?

380
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,780
你已经走了很长时间了  吉米
You've been gone a long time, Jimmy.

381
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,750
怎么不告诉她  你有他妈的兄弟
How do you not tell her about your own fucking brother?

382
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,680
同母异父的
Step-brother.

383
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
面对现实吧  法律上不承认
And let's face it, legally not even that.

384
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,720
-你想玩什么  -不要他妈的装可爱  吉米
-You wanna play like that.  -Don't be fucking cute with me, Jimmy.

385
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,760
我在仓库工作
I was working at that warehouse

386
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,400
挣钱上法律学校的时候 你他妈在哪
to pay my way through law school when you fucking hit it!

387
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,970
我不是一直在做他妈的配件 不是么
I could've been done as a fucking accessory. Huh?

388
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,770
-让你的工作见鬼去  -是啊 我知道 我他妈真傻
-Bye-bye, career.  -Yeah, I know. I was fucking stupid.

389
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,940
妈的  米奇
Fuck, Mitch.

390
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,310
我的意思是 那个时候是带过很多药回来
I mean, Jesus, I was doing a lot of drugs back then.

391
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,450
我是自私
I was selfish.

392
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,180
我有很多他妈的时间
I've had a lot of fucking time

393
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,480
想想我的生活  想想我是谁
to think about my life, think about who I was.

394
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,320
好吗
Okay?

395
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,850
现在  我让你失望
Now I let you down.

396
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,160
但我不会再让你们失望了
But I will not let you down again.

397
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,360
知道么...
Look...

398
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,200
我毕业时遇到了雷切尔
I met Rachel when I was graduating.

399
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,770
她接受了我的申请  到了D.A.办公室
She processed my application to the D.A.'s office.

400
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,040
自从我的妈妈嫁给你爸
Seeing as my ma never officially married your dad-

401
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,010
是啊 你想通 为什么提我们
yeah, you figured  why mention us, right?

402
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,010
吉米  最好我们不要再有联系
Jimmy, it was best for me not to have ties

403
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,880
案子已经结了 知道吗
to a criminal past, you know?

404
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,480
我曾经撒过谎
Once I'd lied on the forms,

405
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,050
-我不知道  -是啊  我明白了
-I couldn't tell  -yeah, I get it.

406
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,220
我明白了
I understand.

407
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
-上帝  -我不再是那个家伙了
-God.  -I'm not that kid anymore.

408
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,930
这是... 河谷
Riverdale, it's...

409
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
这是另一种生活
It was another life.

410
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,900
好吧  你真幸运
Well, lucky you.

411
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,110
我只得到一个
I only got the one.

412
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,210
别走
Hey.

413
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,870
喂
Hello?

414
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,140
嘿  布诺克顿先生  我是加隆
Hey, Mr. Brockden. It's Kanon.

415
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,810
加隆警官你好
Detective Kanon.

416
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,380
要我做什么
What can I do for you?

417
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,320
在查点东西
Just checking in.

418
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,820
我们失去了一个或两个支持者
We lost a point or two

419
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,420
因为那个法医语言学家
on that forensic linguist.

420
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,820
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,560
是啊  我知道了 这是  嗯 -
Yeah, I know. It's, umm-

422
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,230
戴维斯不可能是那个打电话的  所以...
it's almost impossible to make  Davis the caller, so...

423
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,200
是么
Right.

424
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,570
这么晚了  侦探
It's kinda late, detective.

425
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,540
是否有您所需要的
Is there something you need?

426
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
没有  只是想知道
No, just wanted to know

427
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,470
你在为明天上庭做准备
that you're ready for tomorrow.

428
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,110
-什么意思 -什么什么
-What was that?  -What?

429
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,980
你正在录音
You're recording this?

430
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,090
我为什么要录音
Why would I be recording this?

431
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,560
他们说警察很执着
They say that cops are paranoid.

432
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,930
法庭上见
See you in court.

433
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
嘿 她是睡着了
She's asleep. Hey.

434
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,630
嘿
Hey.

435
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,430
你身上有股奶味
You smell like milk.

436
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,530
艾拉又吐奶了
Ella was sick on me, again.

437
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,400
尼斯
Nice.

438
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,640
米奇
Mitch. Hey.

439
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,340
看我
Look at me.

440
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,110
米奇
Mitch.

441
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,580
怎么了
What is it?

442
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
有什么事瞒着我
Is there something you're not telling me?

443
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,620
是
Yes.

444
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,030
什么 你就不能...
What?  Can't you just...

445
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,560
告诉我吗
Tell me?

446
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,570
我爱你
I love you.

447
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,980
我也爱你
I love you too.

448
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,320
全体起立
All rise.

449
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,430
请座
Be seated.

450
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,730
会议开始前 法官大人
Before session begins, your honor,

451
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,100
我宁愿去替补席
I would like to approach the bench.

452
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,270
我也不能容忍罗伯茨先生迟到
I will not tolerate tardiness, Mr. Roberts.

453
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,710
对不起  法官大人 我早就来了
I'm sorry, your honor, but there has been

454
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,010
案情有重要的进展
an important development.

455
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,080
我们希望 调用一个新的证据
Defense would like to call a new witness.

456
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,420
我反对 法官大人 控方没有事先告知
Objection, your honor.The prosecution wasn't informed of this.

457
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,520
控方也是昨天深夜才找到的
Defense was unaware of their identity until late last night.

458
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,090
是什么重要证人 罗伯茨先生
What is the relevance of this witness, Mr. Roberts?

459
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,760
他就是给911打电话的人
He's the man who made the 911 call.

460
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,460
-什么 什么情况 -肃静
-What? What?  -Order!

461
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,570
肃静
Order.

462
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,270
-法官大人 -我赞同并允许  布诺克顿
-Your honor--I'm inclined to allow it, Mr. Brockden.

463
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,270
是的  我理解  但如果你能 -
Yes, I understand that,but if you could just-

464
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,640
-布诺克顿先生  -布朗博士的实验室
-Mr. Brockden!  -Dr. Brown's lab

465
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,540
进行了一整夜语音分析  我们找到了一个匹配的
ran a voice analysis overnight and we got a viable match.

466
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,080
这名证人何时能到庭
How soon can defense present this witness?

467
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,010
马上  法官大人 他整个审判
Right away, your honor.  He's been in the courtroom

468
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,780
一直在法庭上
this entire trial.

469
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,750
我只是要说
Can I just please say some-

470
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,750
够了
Enough!

471
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,550
打电话给你的证人
Call your witness.

472
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,660
辩方称...
The defense calls...

473
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,090
-吉米?洛根承认了  -什么
-Jimmy Logan to the stand.  -What?

474
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,580
事件惊喜的出现了转机
In a surprise twist of events,

475
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,080
证人的出面
a witness came forward today

476
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,350
终止对我的当事人
and ended the prosecution's case

477
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,250
克林顿?戴维斯的起诉
against Clinton Davis.

478
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,580
证人看见受害人 塞西尔?阿克曼
The witness saw the victim, Cecil Ackerman,

479
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,450
被一个肇事逃逸的司机撞倒
mowed down by a hit-and-run driver

480
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,060
是一辆红色S.U.V. 任伤者躺在路上不管
in a red S.U.V. And left on the road to die.

481
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,820
随后 他拨打了911
He then called 911.

482
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,790
由此看来克林顿?戴维斯
It seems that Clinton Davis

483
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,300
不是这次事件唯一的好人
was not the only  good samaritan in this trial.

484
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,670
戴维斯先生
Mr. Davis?

485
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,600
我只是想希望你一切顺利
I just wanted to wish you all the best.

486
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,810
是的  这就像你说的
Yeah, it's like you said

487
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,110
如果我是无辜的  一切都会水落石出
if I was innocent, everything would work out.

488
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,710
是的 我说过
Yes, I did.

489
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,410
所以 现在怎么样
So what happens now?

490
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,790
-你回到你的生活  -不  不  不
-You go back to your life.  -No no no,

491
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,460
我的意思是 肇事逃逸者
I mean with the hit-and-run driver,

492
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,090
只要有一个目击证人
the one the witness saw.

493
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,660
也许他就会自首
Maybe he'll turn himself in.

494
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,230
是你 你会吗
Would you?

495
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,760
我他妈的爱你  你他妈的婊子
I fucking love you,  you fucking bitch!

496
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,360
-婊子  -别闹了
-Whore!  -Stop it!

497
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,730
-我他妈的杀了你 -别闹了
-I'll fucking kill you!  -Stop it!

498
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,230
-不  别烦我  -不要这样对我  你个婊子
-No! Leave me alone!  -Don't do this to me, you fucking bitch!

499
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,400
我他妈的真的爱你
I fucking love you!

500
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,670
-嘿  -混蛋 让我走
-Hey!  -Fucking let me go!

501
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,340
我他妈的爱你
I fucking love you!

502
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,550
佩德罗?冈萨雷斯的尸体
The mutilated  body of Pedro Gonzales

503
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,590
今天一大早在芝加哥河银行被发现
was found early this morning on the bank of the Chicago river.

504
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,190
据验尸官报告
According to a source at the coroner's office,

505
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,920
他的头骨的后部被重力击碎
the back of his skull was badly crushed,

506
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,430
凶器可能是一个锤子
possibly by a hammer.

507
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,660
他的家人说  最后一次看见他
His family says the last time anybody saw him alive

508
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,570
是上周六在北国商城
was at the north mall on Saturday.

509
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,010
我通过数据库比对过一些关键字
I ran some keywords through the database.

510
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,380
显示为一起未解杀人案
It flagged a string of unsolved homicides.

511
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,900
我不能呆在这
I can't stay here. Shit!

512
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,440
哦  他妈的 不 不
Oh fuck. No. No.

513
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,580
我看了尸检结果
I looked at the autopsy results.

514
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,150
阿克曼上的伤口  和冈萨雷斯身上找到是相似的
The wounds on Ackerman were similar to those found on Gonzales.

515
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,150
阿克曼案子是一起肇事逃逸  还记得吗
Ackerman was a hit-and-run, remember?

516
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,950
伤口不确定
The wounds were inconclusive.

517
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,650
在法庭上是你自己指出  亲口说出来的
You yourself pointed that out at the trial.

518
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,160
尚无定论 确切的说
Inconclusive, exactly.

519
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,020
要么它是两者兼而有之
What if it was both?

520
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,430
阿克曼跑到路上
What if Ackerman ran into the path of a car

521
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,500
他试图摆脱戴维斯
because he was trying to get away from Davis

522
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,030
是谁折磨他致死
who was in the process of torturing him?

523
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,500
这解释不了现场的混乱
It explains why the forensics was so confusing.

524
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,170
还有别的吗
Anything else?

525
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,680
谢谢你来告诉我这些
Thanks for coming by.

526
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,600
嘿
Hey.

527
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,610
哦  妈的
Oh fuck.

528
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,410
先生......
Yes sir...

529
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,870
哦  妈的
Oh shit.

530
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,860
-是啊 你好  -你拿到照片了
-Yeah, hello.  -You get my photograph?

531
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,160
-你要干什么  -别再盯着我不放
-What do you want?  -Stop following me.

532
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,330
我知道你做了什么
I know what you did.

533
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,870
可警方不是还没来电话
And yet the cops haven't come a'calling.

534
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,400
为什么你认为是我呢  米奇
Why you think that is, Mitch?

535
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,640
如果你知道我是司机
If you knew I was the driver,

536
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,270
为什么你没有把我扯进来  嗯
why didn't you just turn me in, huh?

537
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,480
在警局 我不想拿出我的王牌
I didn't want to play my ace in the police station.

538
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,310
我需要在法庭上用
I needed to go to court.

539
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,620
我得让我的同行们组成的陪审团
I had to get a jury of my peers

540
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,950
看看你的卡  证明我是无辜的
to see your card, find me innocent.

541
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,360
你想要合理怀疑
You wanted double jeopardy.

542
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,320
游戏结束 这是一张免费通行证
Bingo. A free pass.

543
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,000
-但你没有揭穿我  -没有必要
-But you didn't expose me.  -There was no need.

544
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,660
我能看到你有良心危机
I could see you were having a crisis of conscience.

545
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,400
-这是一个混蛋的游戏  -远非如此
-Is this a fucking game to you?  -Far from it.

546
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,540
我不会让你就此逃脱
I won't let you get away with this.

547
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,010
不  你会的
Yeah, you will,

548
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,610
要么我毁了你
or I will ruin you.

549
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,180
那么  谁来保护瑞秋和Ella
Besides, who's gonna protect Rachel and Ella

550
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,980
当你因为肇事逃逸被抓起来  嗯
when you get locked up for hit-and-run, hmm?

551
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,150
你说什么
What did you say?

552
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,990
家庭是相当重的东西  米奇
Family is a precious thing, Mitch.

553
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,390
这是我们的职责  对我们男人来说
It's our job as men

554
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,560
保护家人
to protect 'em.

555
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,000
戴维斯
Davis.

556
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,950
嘿 关上门
Hey. Shut the door.

557
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,320
那不是阿克曼
Is that Ackerman?

558
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,030
新闻上的那家伙
And the guy from the news.

559
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,730
必须找出所有这些人有什么关联
Have to work out  what links all these men.

560
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,700
他是怎么挑选受害者  还有为什么
How he's picking his victims and why.

561
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,570
谁怎么选择
How who's picking them?

562
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,370
克林顿?戴维斯
Clinton Davis.

563
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,000
什么
What?

564
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,710
这些都是未解杀人案
These are  the unsolved homicides

565
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,510
那加隆认为 拘禁戴维斯
that Kanon thinks match Davis's M.O.

566
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,080
拘禁戴维斯
Davis's M.O.?

567
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,710
戴维 戴维斯是无辜的
Dav-Davis was innocent.

568
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,220
肇事逃逸 米奇 打911报警者已经证明了这一点
Hit-and-run, Mitch. 911 caller proved it.

569
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,080
我懂  我觉得没那么简单
Yeah, I wish it were that simple.

570
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,750
这他妈到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

571
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,090
他妈的什么情况  米奇
What the hell is going on, Mitch?

572
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,130
之前你接了戴维斯的案子 几乎让自己丢掉资格
First you blow the Davis case, almost get yourself disbarred

573
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,730
而现在呢 你想证明
and now what? You're trying to prove

574
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,200
这家伙是 该死的波士顿扼杀者
that this guy is the goddamn Boston strangler?

575
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,000
斯图  如果我能解释这一点  我会的
Stu, if I could explain this, I would.

576
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,770
病理学家是凭借什么认定这些工具
With what pathologists think were tools.

577
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,240
类似八个月前
The first took place  eight months

578
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,110
戴维斯全家被折磨时使用的工具
after Davis's family was tortured with similar tools.

579
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,140
看见了吧  我认为他选择了他们
You see, I think he picked 'em.

580
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,250
我觉得他选择了所有的人
I think he picked all of them,

581
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,750
可他妈的他们共同点是什么
but what the fuck  do they all have in common?

582
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,450
你看吧  阿克曼是一个儿童性骚扰者
Well, Ackerman was  a child molester.

583
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,790
其他的人都不是
None of the others were.

584
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,660
嗯  他们都是有犯罪记录
Well, they do all have criminal records.

585
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,590
那么 你认为 这种行为开始于
So you think this behavior started

586
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,730
家人的死亡 对吧 -是的  我想是的
with the death of his family, right?  -Yes, I do.

587
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,260
所以 让我想想那里发生了什么
So remind me-what happened there?

588
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,600
一名男子闯进他们的家
A man broke into their home

589
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,100
不断地折磨
and systematically tortured

590
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,400
屠杀他的妻子和孩子......
and butchered his wife and child...

591
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,310
用了杀这些家伙类似的工具
using similar tools to the ones that killed these guys.

592
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,580
还让戴维斯观看了整个过程
The guy made Davis watch the whole goddamn thing.

593
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,050
然后他切开他的喉咙离开 让他自生自灭
Then he slit his throat and left him for dead.

594
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,090
他活了下来 这是一个奇迹
It was a miracle he survived.

595
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,820
这家伙的名字叫  伊曼纽尔?弗莱
The guy's name was Emanuel Fryer-

596
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,830
职业罪犯
career criminal;

597
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,490
枪杀的第二天晚上  另一家被入侵
gunned down the following night during another home invasion;

598
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,800
最近被假释  等等
recently paroled; Blah blah blah.

599
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,330
入室行凶 哦  妈的
-Broken home oh shit.

600
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,570
什么
What?

601
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,370
冈萨雷斯  最近假释
Gonzales, recently paroled.

602
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,470
费莱  最近假释
Fryer, recently paroled.

603
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,140
阿克曼  也是最近
Ackerman  was recently

604
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,810
所有这些人都是最近他妈的假释犯
all these men are recently fucking paroled.

605
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,180
斯图  你他妈的就是个天才
Stu, you are a goddamn genius!

606
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,220
妈的 我爱你 爱死你了
Shit.I love you. I love you.

607
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,830
好了  你说
Okay, so you're saying

608
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,560
唯一的原因  阿克曼是在大街上
that the only reason Ackerman was in the street

609
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,830
是因为 戴维斯在追杀他
was because Davis was chasing him.

610
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,160
-嗯  -然后你离开后
-Uh-huh.  -And then after you left,

611
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,200
-戴维斯终结了  -完美推断
-Davis finished the job?  -Exactly.

612
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,570
如果我能找到证据  你知道吗
If I could just get proof, you know?

613
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,870
戴维斯无法从阿克曼案子开脱
Davis can't be retried for Ackerman,

614
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,170
但如果我能得到的证据表明  他 -
but if I can get evidence that he-

615
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,880
他杀死了其他那些人
he killed those other guys,

616
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,610
我可以把我们双方的交易
I can cut us both a deal.

617
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,310
你在宣誓说了什么  我就做了什么 -
What you said under oath,  what I did-

618
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,820
你没事吗
You all right there?

619
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,220
-我所做的  它只是消失
-What I did,  it just goes away.

620
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,160
米奇  我在假释中
Mitch, I'm on parole.

621
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,220
我却要闯入一个他妈的家伙的家里
I get busted breaking into some guy's fucking house-

622
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,760
帮个忙吧  我不要你进去  我自己来
come on, I don't want you breaking in. I'll break in.

623
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,200
我只要你跟踪他
I just need for you to tail him,

624
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,870
告诉他什么时候回来就行
let me know when he's coming back.

625
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,540
啊  那么它只是小小协助及教唆犯罪
Ah, it's just a little aiding and abetting then.

626
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,900
诶
Eh.

627
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,670
算了  米奇
Forget it, Mitch.

628
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,770
这样吧 我答应你
Let it go. I'm done.

629
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,290
这混蛋真的闯进入你家
That fucker really break into your house?

630
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,160
是
Yes.

631
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,230
当我们正在睡觉
While we were sleeping.

632
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,230
好吧  他要知道你的旅程
All right,he's gonna know your ride.

633
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,600
你可以借给我辆干净的车子吗
Can you rent me a clean set of wheels?

634
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,840
当然
Of course.

635
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,170
谢谢你  吉米
Thanks, Jimmy.

636
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,640
你知道吗  我的意思是
You know what?  I mean that.

637
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,440
我可能是一个混蛋  但我还是你的哥哥
I may be an asshole, but I'm still your brother.

638
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,020
再见  戴维斯
See you later, Davis.

639
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,490
好吧  伙计  再见
All right, guys.See you later.

640
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,890
晚安
Have a good evening.

641
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,910
-呦  吉米
-Yo, Jimmy.

642
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,870
找到什么了
Got anything  tying him to the victims?

643
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,510
不 还没有
No. Not yet.

644
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,810
貌似他在这里吃饭和睡觉  仅此而已
Looks like he eats and sleeps  here, but that's about it.

645
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,820
其余时间  他都花在自助团体
The rest of the time he spends in self-help groups.

646
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,590
你知道 有时他一个晚上去两次
You know, sometimes he goes to two a night.

647
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,130
哦  他妈的  找到了
Oh fuck. That's it.

648
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,160
这就是挑选的受害者
That's how he picks his victims.

649
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,700
杀死他家人的是一个假释犯
The guy that killed his family was a parolee.

650
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,770
他们都在假释期
They're all parolee meetings.

651
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,470
没人注意到这个家伙煮咖啡
Nobody notices the guy making coffee.

652
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,540
他像墙上的苍蝇挂起
He just hangs around like a fly on the wall,

653
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,070
监听他 担心这个家伙再犯罪
listening for the guy who feels worried about re-offending.

654
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,210
是啊  我一直去
Yeah, I've been to those meetings.

655
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,240
-这些人房间里全这样  -没错
-The room's full of guys like that.  -Exactly.

656
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,700
他妈的
Fuck me.

657
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,170
他保留了假释卡
He kept their parolee cards.

658
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,600
吉米  那是什么
Jimmy, what's that?

659
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,870
呃  我们附近有个水泥工地
Uh, we're near the cement works.

660
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,670
应该是休息时间
Must be coffee break or something.

661
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,740
你知道么 很近的
You know, that's pretty close.

662
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,650
是他回来了吗
Is he coming back?

663
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,710
我不知道 他走进一个旧仓库
I don't know. He went into some old warehouse

664
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,620
又出来拿着什么东西  不知道他去哪了
and came out carrying something.I lost him.

665
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:51,650
-看着像一些旧工具什么的  -盯好了
-Looked like some old tools or something.  -Get the fuck outta there.

666
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,690

684
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,740

685
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,080
哦  上帝
Oh, Jesus Christ.

686
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,380
杰米
Oh Jimmy.

687
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,380
这是911报警中心 有什么紧急情况
911, what is your emergency?

688
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,750
帮帮我
Help me.

689
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,790
救救我吧  谢谢
Help me, please.

690
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,720
他想杀了我
He's trying to kill me.

691
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,420
-快点  -先生
-Hurry.  -Sir?

692
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,290
先生 谁要杀你
Sir, who is trying to kill you?

693
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,160
先生 先生 你在吗
Sir? Sir, are you there?

694
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,330
先生
Sir?

695
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,140
喂  是啊 我需要一辆救护车
Hello? Yeah, I need an ambulance.

696
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,310
你能听到 -你能听到我吗
Can you hear-can you hear me?

697
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,810
你好
Hello?

698
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,180
是的 我需要一辆救护车
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

699
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,880
-靠  他妈的
-Fuck! Fuck!

700
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,340
-别丢下我  -我要搬动你  好吗
-Stay with me. I'm gonna move you, okay?  -

701
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,970
-好吧  -来吧
-Okay?  -Okay.

702
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,370
好 好 来吧
Okay okay, come on.

703
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,340
来吧 留在我身边
Come on, stay with me!

704
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,440
来吧
Come on!

705
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,190
我们走  伙计
Let's go, men.

706
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,890
嘿
Hey!

707
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,800
-嘿  他需要救护车  -放他下来
-Hey, he needs an ambulance.  -Set him down now!

708
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,770
-哦  他妈的  -把按住
-Oh fuck. -Put him down!

709
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,400
-快点  -放下他
-Do it!  -Put him down now!

710
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,300
-快点  快放下  -操
-Now! Down! Down!  -Fuck.

711
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,650
你他妈的跟我开玩笑 哦 混蛋
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Oh fuck.

712
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:04,540
快
Go!

713
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,480
-他需要救护车  -好了
-He needs an ambulance!  -Cool it!

714
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,250
吉米  上帝  叫他妈的救护车
Jimmy. Oh God, get him a fucking ambulance!

715
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,350
吉米  躺下 就躺那  兄弟
Jimmy, hang in there. Hang in there, brother.

716
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,380
-坚持住  兄弟  -...会人救你......
-Hang in there, brother.  -...can and will be used against you...

717
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,990
-冷静  -躺在那里
-Calm down.  -Hang in there.

718
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,420
你有权请律师
You have the right to an attorney.

719
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,860
我们已经找到一个受伤的白人男性
We've got an injured white male.

720
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,800
-吉米怎样  -他还在昏迷中...
-How's Jimmy?  -He's in a coma...

721
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,830
......医生说有希望
..but the doctors are hopeful.

722
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,240
你要告诉我你们的关系吗
So you wanna tell me what your relationship is to him?

723
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,250
是的  我们  嗯......
Yeah, we're, um...

724
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,850
是同母异父兄弟
step-brothers.

725
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,580
我们的父母只是未正式结婚
Our parents just never married.

726
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,550
这就是为什么他会在法庭上为你说谎
That's why he'd lie for you in court.

727
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,990
没错
Exactly.

728
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,490
那么 为什么现在这样对他
So why turn on him now?

729
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,560
什么
What?

730
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,960
他勒索你了
Was he blackmailing you?

731
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,530
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

732
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,600
不是我干的
I didn't do this.

733
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,200
克林顿?戴维斯干的
Clinton Davis did this.

734
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,140
-用你的锤子  -是的
-Using your hammer?  -Yes.

735
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,580
他闯进我家  偷走了我的工具
He broke into my house, he stole my tools.

736
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,320
你有没有报案
Did you report that?

737
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,120
-没有  -没有
-No.  -No.

738
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,590
锤子有你的指纹
It's only your prints on the hammer.

739
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,960
上帝
Jesus Christ.

740
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,590
我打了911报警电话  上帝做证
I made the 911 call, for Christ's sakes.

741
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,100
我为什么要这么做  如果我是有罪的
Why would I do that if I was guilty?

742
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,330
我真的不知道  米奇
I really don't know, Mitch.

743
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,600
可你之前这么干过
But you did it before.

744
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,940
911  有什么紧急情况
911, what's your emergency?

745
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,610
我需要一辆救护车  一个男士被车撞了
I need an ambulance. A guy's been hit by a car.

746
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,110
在什么位置  先生
What's the location, sir?

747
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,980
呃  基勒
Uh, Keeler.

748
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,480
-这是你  对不对  -是的 是的  是的  是我
-That's you, right?  -Yes yes yes, it's me.

749
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,950
我开车撞了阿克曼  然后走了
I hit Ackerman with my car and I left.

750
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:56,590
这是错误的 我知道 因为我很害怕
It was wrong.I know that, but I was scared.

751
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,360
我喝了酒 这是一个交通意外
I'd been drinking. It was an accident.

752
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,930
我们找到了这个...
We found this...

753
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,130
就在你的工具箱的底部
in the bottom of your toolbox.

754
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,100
沾满了阿克曼的血迹
It has Ackerman's blood  all over it.

755
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,910
一定是戴维斯故意把它放在那里的
Well, Davis must've  put it there.

756
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,680
我帮助阿克曼时 我的卡掉在了现场
I dropped my cards when I was helping Ackerman.

757
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,110
-我一定是掉了一个  -所有的这些证据...
-I must've missed one.  -All of this...

758
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,220
-直接与你有关  -哦  天
-leads directly to you.  -Oh, Jesus Christ.

759
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,290
好了 听我说  好吗 如果我杀了阿克曼
All right, listen, okay? If I killed Ackerman,

760
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,925
为什么我没有钉死戴维斯
why didn't I crucify Davis in court

761
01:05:32,926 --> 01:05:34,560
法庭上当时我有机会  嗯
when I had the chance, hmm?

762
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,930
他是完美的替罪羊
He was the perfect scapegoat.

763
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,530
好吧  这有一个袋子
Okay, there's a bag.

764
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,100
-有个袋子  -是的
-There's a bag?  -Yes.

765
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,940
戴维斯保留的 所有的受害者的I.D.S
Davis kept the I.D.S  of all his victims.

766
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,970
他针对暴力假释者
He's targeting violent parolees

767
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,480
他认为应该重新定罪
that he thinks will re-offend,

768
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,480
就像杀害他的家人
like the man that killed his family.

769
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,380
-包在哪里  -在他家
-Where's this bag?  -In his house.

770
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,980
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

771
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,090
-我去过  -你去过
-I broke in.  -You broke in?

772
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,960
你闯进了他房子里
You broke into his fucking house?

773
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,160
事情严重了  米奇...
Seriously, Mitch...

774
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,730
我怎么知道 不是你把它放在那里
How do I know you didn't put it there?

775
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,710
你知道  我不会再回答任何问题
You know, I don't think I should answer any more questions

776
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,070
直到有律师在场
till I have a lawyer present.

777
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:29,550
你知道  我想
You know, I think

778
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,980
这真是一个非常好的想法
that's a really good idea.

779
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,220
你的电话 斯图尔特?威尔逊从D.A.的办公室打来的
You've got a call-Stuart Wilson from the D.A.'s office.

780
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,590
斯图  你他妈的去哪了
Stu, where the fuck have you been?

781
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,630
对不起  米奇
I'm sorry, Mitch.

782
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,800
这是他们唯一的让我和你谈谈的方式
This is the only way they'd let me talk to you.

783
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,500
现在你听我说 你他妈的王八蛋
Now you listen to me, you fucking son of a bitch.

784
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,570
我会找到你  我会来的  我会取你性命
I will find you, I will come for you and I will take your life.

785
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,570
-你听到了么 戴维斯  -哦  听着呢
-You hear me, Davis?  -Oh, listen to you.

786
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:35,740
当你打Ackerman的时候  你的决心在哪
Where was all that backbone  when you hit Ackerman, huh?

787
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,680
如果你曾表露过决心
If you'd showed it then,

788
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,320
你就会一直等到救护车到来 这样他也不会死
you would've waited for the ambulance and he'd be alive.

789
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,520
当然 他还是会不被约束的
Course, he'd still be free

790
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,790
-到处去伤害孩子们...
-to go around hurting small children...

791
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,090
-...这也是我带走他时他正在做的
-...which he was about  to do when I took him.

792
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:49,830
你其实是知道的 对吧
You do know that, right?

793
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,790
如果你让他好好的一个人呆着
If you'd let well enough alone,

794
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,200
我们永远也不会来到这个地方 米奇
we never would've come to this place, Mitch.

795
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,630
你想干什么
What do you want?

796
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,200
你可以毁了我的生活
You could've ruined my life

797
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,540
或毁了你的
or ruined yours,

798
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,370
但你却发现 第三个选项
but yet you found a third option.

799
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,480
一是帮助我们两个
One that helped us both.

800
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,180
有没有他妈的第三个选项
There is no fucking third option here.

801
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,550
是啊  有
Yeah, there is.

802
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:13,350
如果在他们拘禁你的同时
What if another murder happened  with the same M.O.

803
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,850
发生了另一起相同手法的谋杀怎么办
While they have you  in custody, hmm?

804
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:20,160
走向清白的道路是漫长的
Go a long way towards shedding light on your innocence

805
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,330
即使是因内疚给出一个合理的怀疑
or even throw a reasonable doubt on your guilt.

806
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,460
你说什么  你在说什么
What are you-what are you talking about,

807
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,230
-另一起凶杀案么  -问题是
-another murder?  -The problem is

808
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,630
你不知道我的痛
you don't know my pain

809
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,140
还有我的空虚
or my emptiness.

810
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,310
可现在你要知道为什么是我
But now you're going  to know what it is to be me.

811
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:46,320
戴维斯 戴维斯 是什么...
Davis?  Davis, what...?

812
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,380
你在哪里 戴维斯 嗯
Where are you, Davis? Huh?

813
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,890
我现在得走了 米奇
I have to go now, Mitch.

814
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,890
戴维斯
Davis!

815
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,820
嘿  掉线了 嘿
Hey! Is the line cut? Hey!

816
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,130
我要打个电话  我要往外打个电话
I need a line. I need an outside line.

817
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,900
-戴维斯要杀我妻子  -停
-Davis is going to kill my wife! -Stop!

818
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,770
-嘿  -那混蛋会杀了我的妻子
-Hey! -He's gonna kill my fucking wife.

819
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,740
-Brockden夫人  -我是
-Mrs. Brockden?  -Yes.

820
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,480
我是加隆警官  我不想打扰你
I'm Detective Kanon. I hate to bother you

821
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,310
在这痛苦的时刻  但我想问你几个
at this ungodly hour, but I'd like to ask you

822
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,820
有关你丈夫的问题...
some questions about your husband...

823
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,280
......如果可以的话
...if it's  all right with you.

824
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,250
没事  当然 -我
No, not at all. Of co-I'm-

825
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,250
就一会儿
just one minute.

826
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,300
犯罪嫌疑人 大约55  ...
Suspect is approximately 5'5"...

827
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,700
你知道  我打了一天的电话  我 -
You know, I've been calling all day and I-

828
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:44,530
我希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind.

829
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,870
嘿  警官  刚刚见了一个客户
Hey, officer. Just finished up with a client.

830
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,980
你能告诉我 为什么逮捕我丈夫
Can you tell me what you've arrested my husband for?

831
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,010
-谋杀  -什么
-Murder.  -What?!

832
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,980
我的意思是 这是疯了 米奇
That-I mean,that's insane. Mitch

833
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,680
我知道 我知道  -这是疯了
I know.I know it  -it's crazy.

834
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,690
我个人相信他是无罪的
And I personally don't believe he's guilty at all,

835
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,950
但我只需要问你几个问题 以便澄清
but I just need to ask you some questions to clear-

836
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,260
你能给我倒杯水吗
Could you get me a glass of water, please?

837
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,360
嗯 是的 当然可以
Um, yeah, sure.

838
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,630
晚安 律师先生
Good night,counselor.

839
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,360
小心开车
Drive safe.

840
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,050
你说的没错
There you go.

841
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,380
你看 我只是不明白
Look, I just don't understand.

842
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,720
如果你知道他没有那么做 你为什么还拘押着他
If you know that he didn't do it, then why are you still holding him?

843
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,590
其他侦探对他的事情也有不解之处
Some of the other detectives are having a problem with his story.

844
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,830
就像我说的 我们曾经谈过
But like I said, once we have our conversation,

845
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:50,370
我确定可以澄清一切
I'm sure we can clear that all up.

846
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:20,100
-他接了个电话就疯了  -谁打来的
-He got a phone call and he went crazy.  -Who called?

847
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,400
威尔逊什么的 好像是从D.A.的办公室
Wilson or something from the D.A.'s office.

848
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,100
他咆哮着拨打了另一个电话
He was ranting about making another call,

849
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,470
有人说是要杀他的妻子 戴维斯
said someone was gonna kill his wife. Davis.

850
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,170
什么情况
What the hell's going on in here?

851
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,030
-刚刚是你打电话给米奇  -不是
-Did you just call Mitch?  -No.

852
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,540
申请支援 去Brockden家 快
Get a unit over to Brockden's house now.

853
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,210
瑞秋  瑞秋
Rachel! Rach!

854
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:18,810
哦  有人么 谁来救救我
Oh, somebody! Somebody help me!

855
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,650
-起来  -不  你为什么要这么做
-Get up. -No! Why are you doing this?

856
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:22,650
-起来  -不
-Get up.  -No!

857
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,190
请  不要杀我
Please, don't kill me.

858
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,220
-不要  -不要伤害她
-No. -Don't hurt her!

859
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,760
米奇 米奇
Mitch. Mitch.

860
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,460
枪扔过来
Toss the gun over here.

861
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,670
快点
Do it.

862
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,180
雷切尔 我要你弯腰
Now, Rachel, I want you to bend down

863
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,910
拿着枪管 捡起来
take that gun by the barrel

864
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,580
交给我
and pass it to me.

865
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,220
不管你想怎样 克林顿 结束吧
Whatever you're thinking of doing, Clinton, don't do it.

866
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:01,560
别说没用的 是你自己搞砸了
Well, it looks like you just fucked up

867
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,230
我们合理的疑问 米奇
our reasonable doubt here, Mitch.

868
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:06,260
你的家庭发生了什么可怕的事
What happened to your family was terrible.

869
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,900
这样做  改变不了这一切
Doing this, it's-it's not gonna change that.

870
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,240
我那是在保护别人的家人不再受伤害
I was protecting other people's families.

871
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,200
现在谁在保护你的家人 米奇
Who's gonna  protect yours now, Mitch?

872
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,640
你么
You?

873
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,240
现在你懂了吗 会有人救你吗
You understand now? Do you get it?

874
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,510
是啊  我懂了
Yeah, I get it.

875
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,250
我知道你的妻子和孩子
I get that you watched your wife and child

876
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,680
被折磨致死  而你什么也没做
tortured to death and you did nothing.

877
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,220
你就是个他妈的懦夫
I get that you're a fucking coward.

878
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,520
没话说了吧
You froze.

879
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,930
你关心自己胜过自己的亲骨肉
You cared more about saving yourself than your own flesh and blood.

880
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,760
-米奇  别说了  -你认为找出
-Mitch, please don't  -You think if you take out

881
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,070
尽可能多的假释犯...  -闭嘴
-as many parolees as possible...  -Shut up.

882
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,670
你的家人就不会死了
...you'll make what happened to your family go away.

883
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,740
-别说了  -你知道 如果你还是一个男人...
-Please. -You know, if you were a man...

884
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,280
一个真正的男人 你应该先死
a real man, you would've died first.

885
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,680
我已经死过了
I thought I was dead.

886
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,110
四肢被绑着  喉咙被切开
I was hog-tied  with my throat cut

887
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,120
我是那么的不幸
but I wasn't so lucky.

888
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,690
亲眼看着家人折磨死去
I had to watch my loved ones die.

889
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,590
不过 你没有被绑  米奇
You're not tied up though, Mitch.

890
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,990
那么 你要怎么选择
So what are you gonna do, huh?

891
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,130
你愿意先去死
Are you willing to die first?

892
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:14,560
我愿意
Yes.

893
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,200
是的  我可以
Yes, I am.

894
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,600
我们看看吧
We'll see about that.

895
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,840
哦  米奇  不
Oh! Mitch! No!

896
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,580
你要体验
You need to understand,

897
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,310
看着你爱的人
to see someone you love

898
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,610
流血过多 死在您的眼前 是什么感觉
bleed to death in front of your eyes.

899
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,850
不要 住手
Please. Please don't.

900
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,050
-不要开枪  -乞求是没用的 雷切尔
-Please don't. -Begging won't help, Rachel.

901
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:39,020
我妻子也乞求过
My wife begged.

902
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,360
这是在浪费时间
It's a waste of time.

903
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:44,890
-现在.. -不  不要
-Now..-No! No!

904
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,120
很快你就会体验到我的感受了
Now you're gonna see what it's like to be me.

905
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,620
拜托
Please!

906
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,900
感受到我一样的空虚
To feel my emptiness,

907
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,970
一样的痛苦
my pain.

908
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,910
会给你一些从来没有过的东西 米奇
I'm gonna give you something I never had, Mitch.

909
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,020
来证明你可以做的比我更好
Prove you can  do better than I did.

910
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,220
-请  -开枪吧
-Please. -Go ahead.

911
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:15,690
-拯救...你的家人
-Save... your family.

912
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,930
米奇 不
Mitch, no!

913
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,730
米奇
Mitch!

914
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:24,900
米奇
Mitch!

915
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,770
要我扶你吗
Can I help you with anything?

916
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,970
哦  太可笑了
Oh, you're hysterical.

917
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,340
瑞秋
Rach!

918
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,770
瑞秋 他来了
Rach, he's here.

919
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,240
艾拉给我  打个招呼吧
Give me Ella, then you can say hello.

920
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,980
-我来抱会  -知道了
-Yeah, I got her.  -I know.

921
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:50,490

924
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,790
-你还好吗  -比我想的好多了
-How are you?  -Better than I look.

925
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,930

And this...

926
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:05,870
-天哦  -这是你的侄女......
-Oh Jesus.  -This is your niece...

927
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,770
艾拉
Ella.

928
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:10,470
哦  太可爱了 你好  艾拉

930
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,480

931
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,350

932
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,480
哦  米奇
Oh, Mitch.

933
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,520
你给她起个小名
You named her after your ma.

934
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,050
太棒了
Wow.

935
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:34,900
嗨  你们两家伙别傻站了
Well, I don't know about you guys,

936
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,830

-抱着她没问题吧  -有点紧张
-You okay with her?  -This is terrifying.

939
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,840
你怎么做到这一点
How do you do this?
