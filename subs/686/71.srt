1
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,411
Stay down.

2
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:07,123
Freeze! Just freeze.

3
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,682
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

4
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,423
Sometimes.

5
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,082
It's just adrenaline.

6
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,424
Of course.

7
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,334
How did you know?

8
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:07,104
-I saw him washing the car.
-So did I.

9
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:10,605
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.

10
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,287
Frank...

11
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,357
...I'd like you to stay on.

12
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,218
I'm no good in a permanent position.

13
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,528
My feet go to sleep.

14
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,825
You're turning down $2,000 a week?

15
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,395
So you won't protect Rachel Marron
because she's in show business?

16
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,136
I don't do celebrities.

17
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:05,736
2500.

18
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,146
There's many good men for that much.

19
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,648
Have you talked to...

20
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,908
...Racine, Fitzgerald...

21
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,649
...Portman?

22
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,418
Portman's interested.

23
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,349
But we heard you were the best.

24
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,929
There's no such thing.

25
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:25,930
We're talking about a very frightened
lady with an 8-year-old son.

26
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,001
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't think this was real.

27
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,772
Farmer, she begged me to get you.

28
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,112
Please.

29
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,502
Okay, I'll come.

30
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,612
I'll look the situation over.

31
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,784
If I take it...

32
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,024
...it's 3000 a week.

33
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,895
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.

34
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,195
Watch and see.

35
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,026
Shit.

36
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,647
It's something.

37
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,177
Sorry.

38
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,219
Don't stand there, either.

39
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,789
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

40
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,720
What?

41
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,220
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

42
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,789
Got an appointment?

43
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:24,572
The atomic number of zinc is thirty.

44
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,402
All right.

45
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:34,985
Can I help you?

46
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,226
You the man on the intercom?

47
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,237
Can I help you?

48
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,737
My name's Edison.
I have an appointment.

49
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,109
Arranged by...?

50
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,078
Mr. Devaney.

51
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,239
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.

52
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:57,909
What happened?

53
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,120
A doll.

54
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,243
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.

55
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:20,673
Who?

56
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,075
Henry Ford.

57
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:24,003
Come in.

58
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,828
Playback, everybody.

59
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,109
That's what I want.

60
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,349
Glad you came. Come on.
I'll introduce you to Rachel.

61
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,610
I bet you loved it.

62
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,120
-He doesn't know great art.
-Frank Farmer's here.

63
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:00,022
-Do you think this is me?
-It's terrific.

64
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:01,803
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Who?

65
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,692
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.

66
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:06,203
I think Rory should be my bodyguard.

67
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:09,864
Raise your butt and come meet him.

68
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,985
All right. I'm up.

69
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,216
Frank Farmer...

70
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:20,715
...Rachel Marron.

71
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:29,557
You don't look like a bodyguard.

72
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:31,827
What'd you expect?

73
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,237
Maybe a tough guy.

74
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:37,228
This is my disguise.

75
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,009
His timing's good.

76
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,240
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.

77
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,850
Nice to meet you.

78
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:47,920
Tony Scibelli.

79
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,092
Sy Spector, publicist.

80
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,762
Can we get you a drink?

81
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,763
An orange juice.

82
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,422
Straight?

83
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,374
This is Bill's idea.

84
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,044
A sudden obsession with protecting me.

85
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:14,545
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.

86
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,205
Is this what we talked about?

87
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:19,286
Bill's right. It's time
you took more precautions.

88
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:23,617
I'm sure they'll say the number of
nuts writing fan letters jumps...

89
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:25,787
...whenever Rachel's on a magazine.

90
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,298
Not like this.

91
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,057
Relax, guys.

92
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,799
I said I'll do it, so I will.
See what I'm dealing with?

93
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,410
I'll do this as long as
we understand each other.

94
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,310
I won't let this thing alter my life.

95
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,640
Honey, that won't be a problem.

96
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,651
Rachel's household is informal.
We're all on a first-name basis.

97
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,411
You'll fit in fine.

98
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:50,581
Choose whatever alarm system
you want for the house.

99
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:53,493
Improved security for the gate.
What else?

100
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,504
What else?

101
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:58,763
I think I'm safe when I'm at the house.

102
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:01,505
-So the main thing is when I go out.
-Exactly.

103
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:05,775
Tony will fill you in. I don't want you
falling all over me everywhere I go.

104
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:10,176
Fletcher cannot be affected.

105
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:13,787
I'll cover that. We'll tell him
you've got some other function.

106
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:17,947
I don't want him to think he's in prison.
So the estate must not be altered.

107
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,688
He shouldn't even know you're here.

108
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,698
There's been a misunderstanding.

109
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,700
So if you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us both trouble.

110
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:28,838
By the pool.

111
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,799
It was nice meeting you.

112
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,210
Or the entry door.

113
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,810
Shut up. Wait a minute!

114
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,880
We shouldn't beg this guy.

115
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:43,821
I'm handling this. Farmer,
would you wait a minute?

116
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:50,334
I should have told you more.
I was afraid she wouldn't do it.

117
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,994
I thought I'd let you two work it out.

118
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:54,223
We did.

119
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:58,395
She's not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

120
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:03,575
You've come this far, wait a moment.
I must show you something.

121
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,687
Please, Farmer.

122
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,611
How are you today?

123
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,711
Fine. And you?

124
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:39,782
Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?

125
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,453
No, I don't like boats.

126
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,323
Why not?

127
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,623
I don't know.

128
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:51,404
Sure you do. But you
don't want to tell me.

129
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,894
You're a smart kid.

130
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:58,135
One time I was...

131
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,477
...stuck on a boat with
some people for 4 months.

132
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,806
A lifeboat?

133
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:04,646
No, it was a...

134
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,756
...big, white yacht.

135
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,987
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

136
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,648
What do you know about it?

137
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,588
I've got ears.

138
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,758
I'll remember that.

139
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,170
This is just in the last 6 months.

140
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,840
Have you ever had these
professionally assessed?

141
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:31,110
-I heard you were in the Secret Service.
-That's right.

142
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:33,682
You guard the main man?

143
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,454
I was 2 years with
Carter, 4 with Reagan.

144
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,123
Reagan got shot.

145
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,953
Not on my shift.

146
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,724
Good.

147
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,634
This could be something.

148
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:53,466
Do you think it could be the
same guy who rigged the doll?

149
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,805
Did you tell Miss Marron?

150
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:59,647
About the doll?

151
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:04,226
We said there'd been an electrical
problem, like a short circuit.

152
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,489
She doesn't need this kind of worry.
It'd really upset her.

153
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,719
What about the police?

154
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,889
No need. No one got hurt.

155
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,559
The chauffeur got hurt.

156
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,511
That was nothing.

157
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,900
It was just our people there.

158
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,011
I think we should show him the room.

159
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,254
Is this her bedroom?

160
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:47,595
She sleeps in the room next
to Fletcher's down the hall.

161
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,367
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.

162
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,276
Superstars in their boudoirs.

163
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:53,537
Did you see it?

164
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,217
We found the letter here.

165
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,589
Someone was in here?

166
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,889
Someone broke in and
masturbated on the bed.

167
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,730
-And she doesn't know?
-Are you kidding?

168
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,641
It'd really freak her out.

169
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,241
What do you think?

170
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:21,812
Someone penetrates the house...

171
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,242
...gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.
I'd say...

172
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,313
...that qualifies as a problem.

173
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:28,982
We don't need this.

174
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:30,123
What kind?

175
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,423
-The house is wide open.
-Excuse me?

176
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,924
The house is wide open.

177
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,935
You people have no clue what
security is or how to achieve it.

178
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:42,436
I'll accommodate your work.

179
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,007
I can't protect her like this.

180
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,106
Like what?

181
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:50,177
I won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know what's going on.

182
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:51,438
I'll make her understand.

183
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,789
I'll talk to her.

184
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,969
She won't give you any static.
You have my word.

185
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,200
Sure she will.

186
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:14,641
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?

187
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:45,337
Guess what? It's Oscar time again.

188
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,417
This year the money's on Rachel
Marron for best actress.

189
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,088
And with the theme song
of " I Have Nothing"...

190
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,919
...still big on the charts...

191
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,929
...the versatile actress/singer
might end up having everything.

192
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,054
Why'd you say your name was Edison?

193
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,796
To see how difficult it was to get in.

194
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:30,897
And it wasn't.

195
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,248
-Put it on your arm.
-What's this?

196
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,160
It'll stop the ache.

197
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:58,761
I bet you can fill up a whole day
washing cars and driving Miss Marron.

198
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,502
That's my job.

199
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,001
We're adding to your duties.

200
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,531
You're my new assistant.

201
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:09,843
Says who?

202
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:16,515
I've spent a lot of time guarding people
and I've found one thing to be true.

203
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:21,624
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss their target...

204
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,285
...one person always gets hit.

205
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,686
Who?

206
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,037
The cocky black chauffeur.

207
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,367
Put this in the pool.

208
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:49,891
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have 2 cameras here.

209
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:52,160
A face camera by the call box...

210
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:56,061
...and a scene camera on top
of this pillar, looking down.

211
00:19:56,343 --> 00:20:00,902
I want these trees to be cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.

212
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:05,343
And the people who come into the
property, make sure who they are.

213
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,743
I want these all cut back, okay?

214
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,515
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.

215
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,586
-What're you looking at?
-Frank.

216
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:24,196
This fence is going to come around
this area and end by the gate.

217
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,197
Come on. Let's go.

218
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,378
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Now brake!

219
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,609
Power.

220
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,450
Stop.

221
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,486
Come here!

222
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,486
Come here.

223
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:17,155
That's an unusual tactic for a
guard dog. But it's effective.

224
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:20,327
You can look around if you want.

225
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,167
Sorry to disturb you.

226
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,938
It's okay. It's an excuse to rest.

227
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,109
This is my personal place.
I'm the only one who works out here.

228
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,359
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

229
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,620
This is you and Rachel?

230
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,691
When I was a kid, I put
together this little band.

231
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,532
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

232
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:55,033
Rachel joined the act
and as you can imagine...

233
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,543
...she was quite an entertainer.

234
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:02,315
Even then she could stop the show.

235
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:03,975
So....

236
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,215
I quit.

237
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:07,055
Professionally, anyway.

238
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,715
You never went back?

239
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:12,226
It was pretty obvious who
the star in our family was.

240
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,407
Lot of work went into this.

241
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,668
Lot of work.

242
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,898
No fingerprints, though.

243
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,840
You think this is tied to the doll?

244
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,739
Her manager does.

245
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,220
" I have nothing" is natural,
given the record, the movie.

246
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,752
I lost track of you after Washington.

247
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,362
How's the private stuff?

248
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,534
It's fine.

249
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:49,104
Big money?

250
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,864
It's big money, right?

251
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,284
You wouldn't want this job.

252
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:00,725
It is big money! Fuck! I knew it!
You need an assistant?

253
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:04,726
I'm due to get out of here and l
have had it with assholic behavior.

254
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:07,227
What a scumbag we're covering now.

255
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:10,726
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

256
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:13,298
Hellfire Henry Kent.

257
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,139
Someone wants to pop him.

258
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:18,139
No surprise, with what the
shithead's been saying.

259
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,299
Do everyone a favor.

260
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,310
As you know, we're
non-political these days.

261
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,319
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a few days.

262
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,480
Thanks.

263
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:34,992
Why am I getting all this cooperation?

264
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,593
Are you kidding?

265
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:39,662
She's a big star.
Important people care about her.

266
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,273
Politics and showbiz, it's
the same thing these days.

267
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,334
Thanks.

268
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,175
There she is.

269
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,345
Can I have your autograph?

270
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:57,616
Sure you can.

271
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,126
We're big fans. Can we get a photo?

272
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:05,197
She'll be thrilled. You're her favorite
actress. We've seen all your movies.

273
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:06,698
Take a good one.

274
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,798
Thank you so much.

275
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,699
She'll appreciate it.

276
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,309
I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

277
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:40,564
Help me with this stuff.
You sign "much love, Rachel"...

278
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:43,074
...you sign, "peace and love, Rachel."

279
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:45,905
Let me set you straight on a few things.

280
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,746
For starters, I love this lady.

281
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,257
What I do for her, I do out of love.

282
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:59,086
I'm not some hired fucking gun who's
here to make her life miserable.

283
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:01,187
I do things the way she likes.

284
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,028
Her happiness is everything to me.

285
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,268
No problem. I'd like to
know how you handle things.

286
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,268
I handle things fine.

287
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,709
Watch me and learn.

288
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,079
Turn right.

289
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,370
Is that him?

290
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:18,610
What's going on?

291
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:20,382
Short cut.

292
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:22,381
Want me to do a 180?

293
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:24,612
Slow down.

294
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:37,634
Go up to the house!

295
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:50,147
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

296
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:53,658
He's through messing with my life.

297
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:58,168
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

298
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,399
Farmer, come in here.

299
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:08,010
-He's nuts!
-Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?

300
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:10,912
Robin Leach.

301
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:15,852
That's funny?! He speaks to 20 million
people and he can't get in here!

302
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:17,183
He had an appointment?

303
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,192
What about brunch at Charlie's?

304
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:21,694
Rachel goes there every Sunday.

305
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:24,524
She's not to do things
she's always done.

306
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:27,934
" Not to do things she's always done."
He's a fanatic!

307
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,095
So're the guys he's protecting you from.

308
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:31,935
Excuse me if I don't faint.

309
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,775
Then think about your son.

310
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,617
What do you want?

311
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,377
I want some peace around here!

312
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:43,718
That's right.

313
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:47,559
We're almost done.

314
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,399
And I want to be able to
eat brunch with my friends.

315
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,899
So go on Tuesdays.

316
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:57,741
Tuesday morning brunch.
Where'd you get him?

317
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:07,582
Louise, you have great stuff.

318
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,411
Take it all.

319
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:11,743
Try this on.

320
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:14,494
Hey, Farmer...

321
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,823
...want to come in with me?

322
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:18,924
Just to be safe?

323
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:30,676
You won't believe this...

324
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,516
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.

325
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,617
I didn't use to be.

326
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:46,849
But you get known for being a certain
way, a way people think you are...

327
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,470
...and pretty soon, you get like that.

328
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:52,870
Guess you can't help it.

329
00:28:58,482 --> 00:28:59,882
You don't think so?

330
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:02,971
You're an expert on famous people.

331
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,483
I've seen a few.

332
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,053
And you disagree?

333
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:09,483
You can be as you choose to be.

334
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,554
It's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.

335
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:18,235
Is that why you never stay with your
clients? They too undisciplined for you?

336
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:21,326
Or maybe you start caring about them?

337
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:22,405
Right.

338
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,745
Can't you answer straight once?

339
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:29,076
You're too clever for me.
I can't keep up.

340
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,236
Look at me, Farmer!

341
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,689
You don't approve of me.

342
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,920
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.

343
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:47,691
It gets in the way? Don't like
your emotions getting to you?

344
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,930
Never mix business with pleasure?

345
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:52,201
That's right.

346
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:55,871
Will you grab that red jacket?

347
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,553
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

348
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:05,954
Thanks.

349
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:28,408
-Two minutes.
-Three.

350
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:31,419
Wait. I want to make it really full.

351
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,820
Put it straight up.

352
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,808
Right there.

353
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,149
You must hold it still.

354
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:34,661
What're we looking for?

355
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,320
Bomb.

356
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,231
Don't worry, I already checked.

357
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:43,731
Put it back here a little deeper.

358
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:45,001
Hold it.

359
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:48,402
Okay, now turn it. Good.
There, right there.

360
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:51,173
Pull up there for a second.

361
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:53,253
Son-of-a...

362
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:00,414
I thought it was dinner.

363
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,415
Are we going somewhere else?

364
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:04,685
The Mayan.

365
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:06,367
What's that?

366
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:08,196
It's a club. Let's go.

367
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:10,427
You must tell me about these things.

368
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,037
I just did.

369
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:15,437
Nice suit, Frank.

370
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,548
I want you to keep this.

371
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:24,548
It's beautiful.

372
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,620
It's fitted with a radio transmitter.

373
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:32,130
The clasp sends a signal.
If there's ever a problem, press it.

374
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:33,791
I'll know you need me.

375
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,901
She knows how it works.

376
00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:37,402
Let's go.

377
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,573
Come on, let's go.

378
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,804
Look!

379
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:55,584
Look at this great show.
They don't forget.

380
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:04,827
Get inside. The show's inside.

381
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,166
Henry, just keep driving.

382
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:27,121
How're you doing?

383
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:42,374
He's from Paris, an amazing director.

384
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:46,544
A performance artist. This is
his first video. Rachel loves it.

385
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,555
This is Sy's idea.

386
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,714
-I thought she'd talk to you.
-You said I had an exclusive.

387
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,985
Maybe later. What can I say?
Laurie! How are you?

388
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,997
You know Paul. I'll speak to you later.

389
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:02,567
She doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll help the video.

390
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,510
He sent another one.

391
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:22,250
What do you mean, another one?

392
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,532
What do you mean?

393
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:30,033
-They didn't tell you.
-Tell me what?

394
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:34,203
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threat.

395
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,203
We didn't want to worry you.

396
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:39,433
And somebody got into the house.

397
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:41,045
In my house?

398
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:43,205
-Let's not get hysterical.
-We should go.

399
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,945
While Fletcher was there?!

400
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,885
The house is like Fort Knox.

401
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:49,616
-Right?
-We should go.

402
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,127
No one could...

403
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,226
-Could what?!
-Calm down.

404
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:54,797
Everyone calm down.

405
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,627
Let's just see how she is.

406
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,387
How are you?

407
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,979
"Watch the door" means
no candy, no flowers.

408
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,819
Is he out there?

409
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,591
He's here, isn't he?

410
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:17,621
Maybe.

411
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,591
We don't know that.

412
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:21,491
You know he was in my house!

413
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,602
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

414
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,832
Fine, fine. Bill, you make it!

415
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:27,993
Tell them!

416
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,433
They'll tear the place apart!

417
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:38,844
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,355
...I'm sorry but...

419
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,515
...due to circumstances
beyond our control...

420
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:49,956
Wait!

421
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:52,468
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

422
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:55,368
No fucking freak will run me off stage.

423
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,878
Give it up front.

424
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,880
Let's go. We're on.

425
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,380
We're not coming.

426
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:11,650
I'm afraid Rachel will not
be able to appear tonight.

427
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:22,064
Just a minute. Give me a chance.

428
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:30,004
Bill Devaney, everybody!

429
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:33,674
Hello!

430
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:40,086
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.

431
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,087
I hope you don't mind.

432
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,528
All right. Thank you so much!

433
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:51,188
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.

434
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,528
Go for it, Rachel.

435
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,769
Want to see my new video?

436
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:35,077
Are we having a communication problem?

437
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:36,757
What?

438
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,987
Are we having a communication problem?

439
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:42,427
Keep this aisle clear.

440
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,428
I know what you're saying.

441
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,769
You've got a job to do. But you
must understand Rachel does too.

442
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,329
And that's what she's doing.

443
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,840
Out there.

444
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:55,451
Look, she's so hot now.

445
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,451
If she doesn't get out there...

446
00:37:58,682 --> 00:37:59,671
...she's dead.

447
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:03,521
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

448
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,451
...she's dead anyway.

449
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:14,134
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

450
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:14,993
No.

451
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:19,304
-It could clinch the nomination.
-One word in print about this...

452
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,100
Out of the way!

453
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:50,070
I'll get it.

454
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:52,643
Follow me!

455
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:57,253
-Let us through!
-Fuck you!

456
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,163
Where's the fucking limo?

457
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:20,177
Henry! It's me, Sy!

458
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,618
Stop it! Fuck!

459
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,029
Keep driving.

460
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:55,482
Never done that before.

461
00:40:58,234 --> 00:40:59,923
It's been a long night.

462
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:51,662
Don't you want to know
why I behave that way?

463
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:53,983
I know why.

464
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,507
I don't want to talk about this again.

465
00:44:34,024 --> 00:44:35,483
Got you, didn't I?

466
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,255
Bet you wonder what I'm doing.

467
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,655
You didn't know I jog?

468
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:53,207
Afraid I might get picked
off in my running suit?

469
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:56,877
No. I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to jog with you.

470
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:02,948
Will you walk with me?

471
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,219
I know this is kind of late...

472
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:12,131
...but thank you.

473
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:14,600
I'm glad you're here.

474
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:18,132
And I'm going to try to cooperate.

475
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:21,061
That would be good.

476
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:27,913
Farmer, I have this problem.

477
00:45:28,614 --> 00:45:30,914
This minor little problem.

478
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,825
I'd like to go out for an evening.

479
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:36,555
With a guy. Like a date.

480
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:39,985
But...

481
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,326
...I can't go out...

482
00:45:42,496 --> 00:45:45,495
...on a date because you must
be with me every minute.

483
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:50,276
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

484
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:54,168
So...

485
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,279
...the only thing I can figure...

486
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,939
...is for you to take me out.

487
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,460
That's what I was wondering.

488
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:07,591
You know?

489
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:09,132
What do you think?

490
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:11,291
Only if you want to.

491
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,132
Only if you want to.

492
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:19,543
God, this is so embarrassing.

493
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:22,143
You decide, okay?

494
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,873
Sandy Harris is on the phone.

495
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:28,985
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up.

496
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:06,163
He didn't look like he wanted to die.

497
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:09,262
There's a big difference between...

498
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:12,104
...wanting to die and not fearing death.

499
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:18,175
And so because he had no fear
of death, he was invincible?

500
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,286
What do you think?

501
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,916
He sure creamed them all in the end.

502
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:26,916
That was a good movie.

503
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:30,756
How many times have you seen it?

504
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,697
62 times.

505
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:40,139
-I've seen it a lot.
-You can say that!

506
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:41,709
I've seen it a lot.

507
00:48:59,663 --> 00:49:01,222
Your kind of place?

508
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,503
Your kind of music?

509
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,064
Absolutely.

510
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:11,165
You figure no one can get by you here.

511
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:15,576
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

512
00:49:17,826 --> 00:49:19,815
What do I need you for?

513
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,196
He might get me instead.

514
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,586
You're ready to die for me?

515
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:27,698
That's the job.

516
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,199
And you'd do it?

517
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,428
Why?

518
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,210
I can't sing.

519
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:43,481
Maybe there is some glory in saving a
president or somebody but...

520
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:44,710
...just anybody?

521
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:46,281
Like you?

522
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,110
Yeah, like me.

523
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:51,781
It's a matter of discipline.

524
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:54,462
I don't trust discipline.

525
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:57,634
I know at that crucial
moment I'd cop out.

526
00:49:58,574 --> 00:50:00,033
It happens.

527
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,934
But not to you, fierce Frank.

528
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:04,745
It happens.

529
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:10,475
So have you ever liked anybody?

530
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:13,946
What do you mean?

531
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:17,816
Like me, a girl?

532
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,897
Yeah, a long time ago.

533
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:23,499
What happened?

534
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:25,169
Do you mind if I ask?

535
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,769
You mind if I don't answer?

536
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,328
I don't want to pry.

537
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,669
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

538
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:38,270
What?

539
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:41,181
She didn't die, did she?

540
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:46,081
While you were protecting
her she got killed, right?

541
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:53,864
God! That's not it, is it?

542
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:00,704
That's it, isn't it?

543
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,375
Nobody's perfect.

544
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:11,887
I'm sorry, Frank.

545
00:51:12,957 --> 00:51:14,327
I'm sorry.

546
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,029
Nice try, though.

547
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:31,841
It was less dramatic than that.

548
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,851
She didn't love me anymore.

549
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,681
Can you imagine that?

550
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:42,411
No, not really.

551
00:51:58,276 --> 00:51:59,365
So...

552
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,276
...is this a full-service date?

553
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,787
I'm just asking you to dance.

554
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,459
Come on.

555
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,798
You can dance, can't you?

556
00:52:55,017 --> 00:52:57,507
This is kind of a cowboy song?

557
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,359
Nothing. It's nothing.

558
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:21,861
I mean, it's so depressing.
Have you listened to the words?

559
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:32,283
-It is kind of depressing.
-Yes, it is.

560
00:53:33,554 --> 00:53:37,824
It's one of those somebody's-
always-leaving-somebody songs.

561
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:49,907
Don't worry.

562
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,077
Don't worry.

563
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:54,747
I'll protect you.

564
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,712
It's very quiet here.

565
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:33,954
You ever going to hang these up?

566
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:38,554
Maybe when I'm here long enough.

567
00:54:38,966 --> 00:54:42,135
West Virginia University Football.

568
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:43,936
God!

569
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:46,066
Take a look at you.

570
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:48,377
What'd you play?

571
00:54:48,647 --> 00:54:49,807
The end.

572
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:51,967
Were you tough?

573
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:55,137
No, I was fast.

574
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,499
So you were in the Secret Service?

575
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,301
What made you get out?

576
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:12,301
Money.

577
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:17,412
I can see your tastes are extravagant.

578
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:19,342
May l?

579
00:55:45,618 --> 00:55:47,048
Be careful.

580
00:56:22,825 --> 00:56:25,155
You're a hard one to figure out.

581
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,826
A bodyguard must know very little peace.

582
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:56,691
Watch this.

583
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,950
I've never felt this safe before.

584
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:50,960
No one could get by you.

585
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:56,722
Right now it might not be too difficult.

586
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:34,797
What are you doing?

587
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,620
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.

588
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:47,190
I'm not confused.

589
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:50,361
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.

590
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:55,461
Did I do something wrong?

591
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,293
Nothing.

592
00:58:59,574 --> 00:59:01,063
Then what is it?

593
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,733
Do you want me to beg?

594
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,036
What's going on, Frank?

595
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:23,928
I want to keep straight what my job is.

596
00:59:24,108 --> 00:59:27,167
And what is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

597
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,668
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

598
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:35,680
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.

599
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,409
You didn't do anything.

600
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:39,251
It was me.

601
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:42,050
I got involved with my client.

602
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:43,251
Your client?!

603
00:59:43,692 --> 00:59:45,251
I made a mistake.

604
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:48,892
So you're not attracted
to your client anymore?

605
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:51,122
Christ, I told you why!

606
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:54,193
I can't protect you like this.

607
00:59:57,915 --> 00:59:59,704
So that's it for me?

608
01:00:00,815 --> 01:00:02,075
That's it?

609
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:08,386
I don't believe it!

610
01:00:09,297 --> 01:00:11,086
Accept it, or fire me.

611
01:00:11,457 --> 01:00:12,986
But I can't fuck you.

612
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,010
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

613
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:35,751
She said she doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.

614
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:38,421
I don't like you to use that language.

615
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:50,273
I spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people.

616
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:52,433
That's my job.

617
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:55,203
It doesn't always work.

618
01:00:56,215 --> 01:00:58,144
It doesn't always work.

619
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,775
I don't think I understand.

620
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:06,227
I'm an old man compared to you
and I don't understand either.

621
01:01:07,057 --> 01:01:09,216
I'm starting to get the feeling...

622
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:11,056
...that I never will.

623
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:18,538
I thought you'd like to know.

624
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:24,239
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

625
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,069
But you already knew that.

626
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:37,822
Sorry. It's completely out of line.
It was none of my business.

627
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:55,684
It's off to Miami today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron.

628
01:01:55,856 --> 01:02:00,345
She'll give two AlDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.

629
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:02,046
$1,000 a plate, no less.

630
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:05,958
And it's a brave man who'd
deny she's worth every cent.

631
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,900
This is Mobile 1 to Station 2.
Zero 2, engineering.

632
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,940
Have them do a 14 reference to
presidential suite balcony.

633
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:27,712
It's okay. They're cleared.

634
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:33,261
Mobile 2 to Catering. Security
says to clear kitchen aisle...

635
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:37,093
...of all obstructions and traffic,
effective immediately.

636
01:02:37,904 --> 01:02:39,423
Mobile 2 to front of house.

637
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:43,804
Security requests updated list of
all ticket holders for concert.

638
01:02:44,045 --> 01:02:48,745
Please fax copies of any names which are
added to the list to Security Office.

639
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:53,346
What a silly job this is.

640
01:02:55,187 --> 01:02:57,056
Okay, we're rolling!

641
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:59,346
-Showtime, everybody!
-ls this necessary?

642
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:01,657
Yes, it is. Let's go.

643
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:06,128
Quit bitching. You get paid for this.

644
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:09,139
Rachel, can you give us
a couple of minutes?

645
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,930
-How do you like our city?
-I love it! I love Miami!

646
01:04:54,649 --> 01:04:56,508
Did you arrange all this?

647
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,449
Hey, that's me!

648
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,362
Hello, Frank.

649
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,362
It's been a long time.

650
01:05:18,674 --> 01:05:19,934
You working?

651
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:24,143
Not technically, but
the Governor may come...

652
01:05:24,315 --> 01:05:26,945
...so I thought I'd give a light check.

653
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:30,154
Someone else is covering him now.

654
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:32,215
How old's she?

655
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,786
Maybe 18.

656
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:43,857
Thank you.

657
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:47,337
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

658
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,979
I want you all to have a good time...

659
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:55,409
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as you possibly can.

660
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,980
Thank you.

661
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:01,521
I'd call that a step
up from the President.

662
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,521
Probably sings better too.

663
01:06:06,392 --> 01:06:07,381
Handful.

664
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:12,603
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

665
01:06:16,844 --> 01:06:18,363
Wasn't your fault.

666
01:06:19,015 --> 01:06:20,674
You weren't even there.

667
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:28,015
I need a drink.

668
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:37,457
Orange juice.

669
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:39,558
Who're you?

670
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:41,028
Greg Portman.

671
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,569
I take it you've met my bodyguard.

672
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,578
We used to work together.

673
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,409
Well, well, well.

674
01:06:51,951 --> 01:06:53,780
What do you do now?

675
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:55,581
Same thing as Farmer.

676
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:58,651
Two samurai, huh?

677
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:03,661
So are you working now?

678
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:06,262
Not right now.

679
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:07,793
Good.

680
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:11,902
Because I'm the only person in
this room that needs protection.

681
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:17,445
Let's get a drink. A real one.

682
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:36,528
Orange juice, sir?

683
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:46,310
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.

684
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:51,540
Why don't you go back and watch?

685
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:30,818
No, I'm not doing this.

686
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:32,828
You are.

687
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,300
Please go now.

688
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,079
Not right now.

689
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,852
Mr. Portman was just leaving.

690
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:53,612
Good night, Rachel.

691
01:09:11,116 --> 01:09:12,205
Shit.

692
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:11,806
What are you looking at?

693
01:10:14,188 --> 01:10:17,818
You probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.

694
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:20,117
Coffee?

695
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,900
You're a self-righteous bastard.

696
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,140
Don't laugh! Don't dare judge me!

697
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:33,831
Give me a break. I didn't tell
you to fuck everyone in the hotel!

698
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,842
Fuck this. I don't need this shit.

699
01:10:43,294 --> 01:10:46,193
Industrial detergent.
It matches the traces in the glue.

700
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,824
We'll nail this sucker.

701
01:10:50,365 --> 01:10:52,194
Don't take too long.

702
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:55,664
It's good money, isn't it?

703
01:10:57,676 --> 01:10:59,145
It's good money.

704
01:11:29,711 --> 01:11:32,011
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

705
01:11:32,183 --> 01:11:35,883
-Where's Tony?
-I thought you were with her.

706
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:46,263
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

707
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,424
The door to the suite! Where is he?

708
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:52,735
Get someone up here, now!

709
01:11:54,037 --> 01:11:55,026
He doesn't know.

710
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:56,577
Where're you going?

711
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:06,217
Where in the hell have you been?

712
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,828
I went to Bal Harbor to shop.

713
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,459
You want these in the bedroom?

714
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:13,818
Leave them so I can look at them.

715
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,129
You had us worried. You know
you're not supposed to do that.

716
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:20,401
I'll do what I want when I want.

717
01:12:21,242 --> 01:12:22,602
Besides...

718
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:25,942
...I'm tired of hanging
around deadbeats.

719
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:27,842
No offense Tony.

720
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:35,953
Once more and I'm gone.

721
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:39,684
You remember something.
You work here. You work for me!

722
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:41,695
Where're you going?

723
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:43,954
To check the route, as usual.

724
01:12:47,606 --> 01:12:48,665
Did Fletcher call?

725
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:14,731
Gomez!

726
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:30,014
What are you doing?

727
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:32,143
None of your fucking business.

728
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:34,184
Move!

729
01:13:35,865 --> 01:13:37,694
Stick it up your ass!

730
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:56,518
Stop! Don't hurt my husband, mister!

731
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,179
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.

732
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:14,071
I'm sorry.

733
01:14:30,295 --> 01:14:31,284
Hello.

734
01:14:31,465 --> 01:14:32,554
Mommy?

735
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:35,625
Fletcher, is that you?

736
01:14:44,108 --> 01:14:45,097
Listen.

737
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,307
I'm through, Bill.

738
01:14:47,478 --> 01:14:50,467
I'm through. I'll get you
back to L.A. and that's it.

739
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:52,778
Fletcher's guard'll cover you.

740
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,109
She got another call.

741
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,649
-I don't care.
-It was him. Same guy.

742
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,849
I don't care!

743
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:03,489
It really shook her up. She thought
it was Fletcher calling from L.A.

744
01:15:03,661 --> 01:15:06,431
I know she'll be reasonable now.
Come on.

745
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,191
Save it, Devaney!

746
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:12,332
Those who hire me don't have to be
convinced to save their own lives!

747
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,272
Call me when she's ready.

748
01:15:57,932 --> 01:16:00,861
Nothing that's happened
between us matters.

749
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:06,031
I understand now.

750
01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:11,872
You must believe me because
I'm not going to beg.

751
01:16:14,414 --> 01:16:16,283
It wasn't what he said...

752
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:19,284
...it was the way he said it.

753
01:16:21,756 --> 01:16:24,745
Frank, I need you. I'm afraid.

754
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:28,356
And I hate my fear.

755
01:16:30,968 --> 01:16:33,438
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.

756
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,967
If anything happened to him....

757
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:37,908
I can't.

758
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,239
I can't.

759
01:16:40,549 --> 01:16:42,979
I can't protect you like this.

760
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,619
It's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.

761
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:51,991
I will do whatever you say.

762
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:03,733
I'd want to take you away from here.

763
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:06,472
I can do that.

764
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:15,115
It'd mean cancelling your concerts.

765
01:17:19,126 --> 01:17:20,185
All right.

766
01:17:21,497 --> 01:17:23,126
No more Sy.

767
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,967
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

768
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:33,598
Okay.

769
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:38,499
You cross me up this time, l
swear I'll kill you myself.

770
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,281
Lake's low.

771
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,710
It'll rise when it thaws.

772
01:18:52,304 --> 01:18:53,494
They all in trouble?

773
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:57,874
Just one.

774
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:06,574
He likes you.

775
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:09,005
So is that going to protect us?

776
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:12,426
He's a trained noisemaker.

777
01:19:12,657 --> 01:19:14,097
Come here, Foster.

778
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:15,827
Just what we need.

779
01:19:16,027 --> 01:19:20,027
I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

780
01:19:20,168 --> 01:19:21,657
And this one does?

781
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:24,268
Yeah, this one does.

782
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:37,951
Excuse me.

783
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:42,061
Katherine had this place
organized the way she wanted it.

784
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:44,452
That's Frank's mama.

785
01:19:52,574 --> 01:19:54,974
Fletcher can't swim very well.

786
01:19:55,215 --> 01:19:57,474
He better stay in the boat then.

787
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:13,498
Frank says you're a singer.

788
01:20:13,828 --> 01:20:15,228
That's right.

789
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:20,738
We're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.

790
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:22,239
That's okay.

791
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:27,409
You must be very successful if
you need someone like Frank.

792
01:20:31,251 --> 01:20:32,511
It's quiet here.

793
01:20:33,422 --> 01:20:36,751
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.

794
01:20:37,863 --> 01:20:39,123
Reagan thing?

795
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:43,703
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.

796
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,375
That's the day we buried Katherine.

797
01:20:56,647 --> 01:20:58,136
He's a rascal now.

798
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,275
Tell us.

799
01:21:00,217 --> 01:21:01,377
I never hit him.

800
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:02,957
-Ever.
-You should have.

801
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:05,457
That's unusual for my people.

802
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:08,658
So what happens is, he's
about 10 years old...

803
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:11,288
...and he starts complaining to me.

804
01:21:11,669 --> 01:21:12,728
How about that.

805
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:16,298
Dad, I'll tell them about the
time you stripped in court.

806
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,409
I want to hear this.

807
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,729
I'm proud of that!

808
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:25,740
So, anyway, he starts
playing tackle football...

809
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:30,681
...when he's 10 and one day he comes to
me and says he's afraid of being hit.

810
01:21:31,093 --> 01:21:35,183
Says it's my fault. "How come
you never hit me?" he says to me.

811
01:21:35,434 --> 01:21:37,994
How about that? He got over it.

812
01:21:39,004 --> 01:21:41,434
Turned into one hell of a wide receiver.

813
01:21:42,004 --> 01:21:46,094
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

814
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:50,935
Something scared him, he'd just keep
doing it until the fear went away.

815
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:54,786
His mama was the same way.

816
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:56,787
You have a beautiful family.

817
01:21:57,018 --> 01:21:59,788
-You had enough to eat?
-Fletcher, wipe your mouth.

818
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:02,787
-Save some for dessert.
-You through, bucket mouth?

819
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:07,298
I won't tell about when you
were 13 and discovered girls.

820
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,130
Come on.

821
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,470
You can run but you can't hide.

822
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:23,381
I'm black, right?

823
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:26,042
You know you're white. Your move!

824
01:22:26,253 --> 01:22:28,242
My move? You're sure?

825
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:31,053
The last move, I took your rook.

826
01:22:37,405 --> 01:22:38,565
That's right.

827
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:46,905
How long has this been going on?

828
01:22:49,847 --> 01:22:50,836
3 years.

829
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:54,777
First year he had me on the run.

830
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:00,688
What do you think?

831
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,600
Knight to king-four.

832
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,689
City kid.

833
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,453
Son, you come here and sit with me.

834
01:23:30,895 --> 01:23:33,625
Well, that's it for me, guys.
I'm going to bed.

835
01:23:33,905 --> 01:23:35,734
You're in trouble.

836
01:23:47,848 --> 01:23:50,348
Foster, right here. Turn around.

837
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:08,442
Good night, Rachel.

838
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,271
Good night, Frank.

839
01:24:11,442 --> 01:24:14,002
Good night, Foster. Good night.

840
01:24:16,383 --> 01:24:18,282
It's good to hear you laugh.

841
01:24:23,624 --> 01:24:24,683
Stay.

842
01:24:46,418 --> 01:24:48,217
You're very thorough.

843
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:58,330
What's happening with you and Rachel?

844
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:03,840
One minute she has magnetic
hands and the next she hates you.

845
01:25:04,012 --> 01:25:06,342
I don't know what's going on now.

846
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:09,012
You follow all her moves this closely?

847
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:13,442
It's a living.

848
01:25:14,454 --> 01:25:15,854
No, it's not.

849
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,695
You must think my life's pretty sick.

850
01:25:27,766 --> 01:25:30,106
You must. I do.

851
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:33,606
Then why don't you change it?

852
01:25:38,478 --> 01:25:40,107
Is it that easy?

853
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,060
You're a lovely woman.

854
01:25:56,802 --> 01:25:58,501
But you don't want me?

855
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:05,143
I'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you.

856
01:26:05,313 --> 01:26:08,013
Why stop at one sister when
you can fuck them both?

857
01:26:10,023 --> 01:26:12,012
I make my mistakes.

858
01:26:12,525 --> 01:26:14,654
But you didn't say no to the boss.

859
01:26:27,777 --> 01:26:29,177
Is this elk?

860
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:35,549
- A dear?
- Yes

861
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,618
Big.

862
01:26:47,131 --> 01:26:50,190
First time I've heard church
music in the middle of the week.

863
01:27:02,654 --> 01:27:07,314
Jesus loves me, oh, yes, he does.

864
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:16,325
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

865
01:27:21,407 --> 01:27:26,107
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

866
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,508
For the Bible...

867
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:36,749
...tells me so.

868
01:27:40,261 --> 01:27:42,350
-Hi, kiddo.
-Hi, honey.

869
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:01,484
Where's Fletcher?

870
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,790
Help!

871
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:36,151
He can't swim!

872
01:28:46,242 --> 01:28:47,532
Help!

873
01:28:48,803 --> 01:28:50,143
Help!

874
01:28:51,444 --> 01:28:53,073
Let me have him!

875
01:29:04,996 --> 01:29:06,555
What were you doing?

876
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:09,325
You're crazy!

877
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:10,627
You are out of your mind!

878
01:29:11,337 --> 01:29:14,636
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!

879
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,338
I'm sorry.

880
01:29:17,938 --> 01:29:19,278
I got careless.

881
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,638
How will we get the boat back?

882
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:36,481
Put them in there.

883
01:29:46,444 --> 01:29:50,674
Someone's cut the phone lines. Could
be anywhere between here and town.

884
01:29:50,984 --> 01:29:53,674
Both cars are dead. I don't see how.

885
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:57,514
Who knows you're here?

886
01:29:58,155 --> 01:30:00,815
I don't know. This place
has nothing to do with her.

887
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,515
Maybe it has to do with you.

888
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:08,157
And we can't walk out of here at night.

889
01:30:08,337 --> 01:30:09,396
I know.

890
01:30:10,168 --> 01:30:12,798
We'll stay and walk out at first light.

891
01:31:31,433 --> 01:31:33,492
I was an idiot last night.

892
01:31:39,005 --> 01:31:41,505
What'd you think about today?

893
01:31:48,817 --> 01:31:50,946
I think this is no maniac.

894
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,286
He knows what he's doing.

895
01:31:56,128 --> 01:31:57,827
You're right. He does.

896
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:02,969
Tell me about it.

897
01:32:04,309 --> 01:32:06,538
-Who is it?
-He almost got Fletcher...

898
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:08,039
How do we stop him?

899
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:10,770
-He almost got the baby!
-Who is it?

900
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,469
I don't know.

901
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,780
Call it off.

902
01:32:13,981 --> 01:32:16,781
He doesn't even know who hired him.

903
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:21,480
I don't know who he is and
he doesn't know who I am.

904
01:32:22,392 --> 01:32:24,151
How did you do it?

905
01:32:25,063 --> 01:32:26,223
How?

906
01:32:26,403 --> 01:32:28,693
I went to a bar in East L.A.

907
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:33,633
I asked around. And there was this guy.

908
01:32:33,805 --> 01:32:34,794
Name?

909
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:36,804
-Armando.
-Give me his name!

910
01:32:37,645 --> 01:32:38,875
Armando.

911
01:32:44,086 --> 01:32:46,516
He arranged it, that's all I know.

912
01:32:47,587 --> 01:32:48,817
It's all paid?

913
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:53,828
Is it paid for?

914
01:32:54,029 --> 01:32:56,899
And then some, okay? Till it's done.

915
01:32:59,269 --> 01:33:01,599
He keeps going until he kills her?

916
01:33:05,381 --> 01:33:08,841
-What's the name of the bar?
-I'm not sure.

917
01:33:09,111 --> 01:33:10,210
I was stoned.

918
01:33:13,292 --> 01:33:16,221
All right. How about the letters?

919
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:20,563
The letters came first. I don't
know who's writing the letters.

920
01:33:20,763 --> 01:33:23,463
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

921
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:26,933
Those are my thoughts. I hate her.

922
01:33:30,645 --> 01:33:32,935
It made me think I could do it.

923
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:38,076
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!

924
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:39,235
I know.

925
01:33:41,587 --> 01:33:43,416
You must stop it.

926
01:33:43,587 --> 01:33:44,576
We will.

927
01:33:44,957 --> 01:33:46,426
You and me.

928
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:57,428
Don't you want to know why?

929
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,440
You told me.

930
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,770
She has everything.

931
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:08,670
What if we can't find him?

932
01:34:14,824 --> 01:34:16,923
Stay here and don't move.

933
01:34:33,487 --> 01:34:35,006
-It's me!
-God!

934
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:37,147
What's happening?

935
01:34:37,788 --> 01:34:38,777
Stay with her!

936
01:34:39,018 --> 01:34:42,387
-Where's Nicki?
-No! No, stop! I'm the one--

937
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:00,810
-Dad?
-We're okay.

938
01:36:19,336 --> 01:36:21,676
-Doesn't make sense.
-What do you mean?

939
01:36:21,847 --> 01:36:22,906
We got him.

940
01:36:23,147 --> 01:36:25,136
What do you mean? Where?

941
01:36:25,347 --> 01:36:28,837
Here. Last night. In L.A.
You should see this guy's locker.

942
01:36:28,988 --> 01:36:30,677
He's obsessed with her.

943
01:36:30,858 --> 01:36:32,148
You sure it's him?

944
01:36:32,358 --> 01:36:34,688
Forensics say a 100% positive lD.

945
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,288
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

946
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:38,989
We know you did it.

947
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,099
Ray's with him now.

948
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:46,699
It's you that sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

949
01:36:46,871 --> 01:36:47,930
We know!

950
01:36:48,942 --> 01:36:50,172
We know it!

951
01:36:50,382 --> 01:36:55,012
Whoever you got down there wasn't here
last night. This was a professional.

952
01:36:55,653 --> 01:36:56,943
This is crazy.

953
01:36:57,123 --> 01:36:58,712
What do you want to do?

954
01:37:00,894 --> 01:37:02,114
How long can you keep him?

955
01:37:02,824 --> 01:37:05,194
All he's done is write some letters.

956
01:37:05,564 --> 01:37:08,324
48 hours maximum. You know the deal.

957
01:37:10,135 --> 01:37:11,325
I know.

958
01:37:17,607 --> 01:37:22,066
Strict security surrounded the funeral
of music executive Nicki Marron...

959
01:37:22,888 --> 01:37:26,878
...who was shot at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.

960
01:37:27,018 --> 01:37:30,007
Nicki was the eldest
sister of Rachel Marron.

961
01:37:30,189 --> 01:37:34,558
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...

962
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:39,030
...and added that naturally it cast a
pall over the upcoming award ceremony.

963
01:38:54,655 --> 01:38:55,815
You okay?

964
01:38:57,495 --> 01:39:01,125
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?

965
01:39:02,906 --> 01:39:04,735
I couldn't sleep.

966
01:39:06,837 --> 01:39:09,677
It was so scary, just thinking about it.

967
01:39:11,748 --> 01:39:13,737
Are you scared?

968
01:39:14,618 --> 01:39:16,607
Everybody's afraid of something.

969
01:39:18,749 --> 01:39:21,519
That's how we know we
care about things...

970
01:39:22,519 --> 01:39:24,148
...when we're scared to lose them.

971
01:39:26,231 --> 01:39:27,700
What are you afraid of?

972
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:33,171
I think you should try
to go back to sleep.

973
01:39:36,242 --> 01:39:38,712
Is it the man who killed Nicki?

974
01:39:40,884 --> 01:39:42,783
Are you afraid of him?

975
01:39:45,954 --> 01:39:47,254
Then what?

976
01:39:48,724 --> 01:39:50,653
What are you afraid of?

977
01:39:57,566 --> 01:39:59,255
I'm afraid of not...

978
01:40:00,907 --> 01:40:02,197
...being there.

979
01:40:08,748 --> 01:40:11,737
It's late. Want me to
take you up to your room?

980
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:08,518
May I sit down?

981
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:23,890
It isn't over yet, is it?

982
01:41:27,543 --> 01:41:29,062
So he'll come again?

983
01:41:30,374 --> 01:41:31,774
It's possible.

984
01:41:33,184 --> 01:41:34,203
At the Oscars?

985
01:41:36,085 --> 01:41:37,245
Maybe.

986
01:41:41,856 --> 01:41:43,555
Back in Squirrel Hill...

987
01:41:44,856 --> 01:41:49,696
...I started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday I'd win an Oscar.

988
01:41:51,567 --> 01:41:55,397
So it's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.

989
01:41:57,038 --> 01:42:01,338
If every one of those pikers comes
through, it'd add up to a lot of money.

990
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,949
I don't know, Rachel.

991
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,280
I think it's still dangerous.

992
01:42:11,421 --> 01:42:14,951
I didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.

993
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:19,892
How about you?

994
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:24,732
Out there on the edge.

995
01:42:24,903 --> 01:42:28,242
Haven't you done something
that didn't make sense...

996
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:32,974
...except inside you? In your stomach?

997
01:42:36,986 --> 01:42:38,455
I know you have.

998
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:41,556
Because no one gets good without it.

999
01:42:42,327 --> 01:42:43,757
And I know you're good.

1000
01:42:49,568 --> 01:42:50,627
Look...

1001
01:42:51,638 --> 01:42:54,168
...I don't know why this is happening...

1002
01:42:56,109 --> 01:42:58,479
...but I know it's not your fault.

1003
01:42:59,009 --> 01:43:03,009
And I hope you can hear me because
this is the way I say I'm sorry.

1004
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,950
So...

1005
01:43:07,021 --> 01:43:09,581
...I'm going to the
Oscars and see if I win.

1006
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:13,580
And I won't worry about
it at all, because...

1007
01:43:14,363 --> 01:43:16,352
...I have you to protect me.

1008
01:43:18,303 --> 01:43:19,603
That's right.

1009
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:25,805
That's right.

1010
01:44:10,033 --> 01:44:13,493
We'll go straight back to the Green Room.
Got that, Tony?

1011
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:15,363
Tony knows what he's doing.

1012
01:44:16,204 --> 01:44:20,374
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

1013
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:21,964
Right?

1014
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:24,674
Unless I lose the award.

1015
01:44:28,056 --> 01:44:29,456
Jesus, what a crew!

1016
01:44:32,987 --> 01:44:34,287
Screw it.

1017
01:44:34,527 --> 01:44:36,456
I'm tired of worrying.

1018
01:44:36,768 --> 01:44:38,387
When your time is up...

1019
01:44:39,468 --> 01:44:40,587
...it's up.

1020
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:43,068
Right, Frank?

1021
01:45:07,104 --> 01:45:09,564
-Rachel Marron, how are you?
-Fine. And you?

1022
01:45:09,734 --> 01:45:11,104
Good. You look lovely.

1023
01:45:11,274 --> 01:45:13,333
-Thank you.
-And they love you, don't they?

1024
01:45:13,504 --> 01:45:14,734
They're going wild!

1025
01:45:14,944 --> 01:45:17,434
So are you the queen of this night?

1026
01:45:17,575 --> 01:45:18,805
Let's hope so.

1027
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:23,736
Good luck. Everybody's pulling for you.
Rachel Marron, everybody.

1028
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:33,758
And the award for best
achievement in sound...

1029
01:45:34,469 --> 01:45:35,958
...goes to...

1030
01:45:36,129 --> 01:45:37,758
...Kay Colvin...

1031
01:45:37,969 --> 01:45:40,958
...and Mychal Smith for "Hot and Cold."

1032
01:46:02,233 --> 01:46:04,092
Thank you so much.

1033
01:46:04,504 --> 01:46:06,693
I want to thank our producers.

1034
01:46:09,705 --> 01:46:13,405
There is a gap, house left, rows EE FF.
Get me some fillers.

1035
01:46:16,246 --> 01:46:19,575
You look beautiful. I just need to
tell you your responsibilities.

1036
01:46:21,717 --> 01:46:24,417
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.

1037
01:46:24,588 --> 01:46:27,887
At 8:07, you will be
presenting with Clive Healy.

1038
01:46:28,598 --> 01:46:30,028
Your lines.

1039
01:46:30,269 --> 01:46:33,598
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.

1040
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:40,040
I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

1041
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:44,440
That's right and I don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.

1042
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:45,841
I wish.

1043
01:46:46,382 --> 01:46:48,852
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?

1044
01:46:49,052 --> 01:46:53,922
Coming out of commercial. Five,
four, three, two. Cue music.

1045
01:46:55,223 --> 01:46:56,692
Cue Robert.

1046
01:46:59,564 --> 01:47:01,623
Welcome back to the Academy Awards.

1047
01:47:01,764 --> 01:47:03,233
Stand by, dancers.

1048
01:47:03,405 --> 01:47:06,774
I just heard that in New York
the economy is so bad...

1049
01:47:06,946 --> 01:47:10,065
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.

1050
01:47:12,946 --> 01:47:16,075
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

1051
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:19,416
No more carrots.

1052
01:47:19,888 --> 01:47:22,188
Did you like the couple that just won?

1053
01:47:22,328 --> 01:47:25,257
Did you ever see a woman on
sound that looked like that?

1054
01:47:25,659 --> 01:47:27,718
She must have been the boom girl.

1055
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,260
Looked like the bada-bing-bada-boom
girl right there.

1056
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,800
If she's working sound, who's listening?

1057
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:35,331
Lighting change.

1058
01:47:35,511 --> 01:47:39,101
And he was eloquent: "It's the
most happiest day of my life."

1059
01:47:39,281 --> 01:47:42,911
Bet his mother was very
most proudest of him then.

1060
01:47:43,112 --> 01:47:44,272
20 seconds.

1061
01:47:47,752 --> 01:47:49,451
Hi, Frank. How are you?

1062
01:47:49,823 --> 01:47:50,912
Why're you here?

1063
01:47:51,524 --> 01:47:53,463
-On the job.
-Who?

1064
01:47:55,294 --> 01:47:56,283
Him.

1065
01:47:56,935 --> 01:47:58,365
Short-term gig, but...

1066
01:47:59,235 --> 01:48:00,465
...profitable.

1067
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:05,845
Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.

1068
01:48:08,016 --> 01:48:09,775
Cue music.

1069
01:48:11,187 --> 01:48:12,676
Cue dancers.

1070
01:48:20,959 --> 01:48:22,259
Back to work.

1071
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:24,818
See you at the Governor's ball.

1072
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:39,001
She sounds great.

1073
01:48:39,253 --> 01:48:41,743
I want her run out of town.

1074
01:48:42,053 --> 01:48:43,213
She must go!

1075
01:48:44,153 --> 01:48:45,553
Tony, you there?

1076
01:48:47,264 --> 01:48:48,313
Tony?

1077
01:48:49,264 --> 01:48:53,723
I have a feeling this is the night.
He'll go for her on camera.

1078
01:48:54,005 --> 01:48:55,165
That's crazy!

1079
01:48:55,335 --> 01:48:59,275
That's how he wants it to look;
but he's not crazy, he's very clever.

1080
01:48:59,436 --> 01:49:01,996
Listen, I need you to help me tonight.

1081
01:49:02,177 --> 01:49:05,576
You can't use that thing.
There's bad breakthrough.

1082
01:49:05,747 --> 01:49:07,446
I must disconnect you.

1083
01:49:08,587 --> 01:49:09,576
I'll do it.

1084
01:49:11,518 --> 01:49:13,647
You get it back after the show.

1085
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,789
What's wrong?

1086
01:49:26,972 --> 01:49:28,272
Ready to go?

1087
01:49:29,372 --> 01:49:30,602
Shall we go?

1088
01:49:30,942 --> 01:49:33,672
Gentlemen, is this necessary?
Must we have everyone?

1089
01:49:33,853 --> 01:49:36,313
We have our own man at the door!

1090
01:49:36,783 --> 01:49:37,842
Please.

1091
01:49:38,554 --> 01:49:40,543
No, I want him.

1092
01:49:43,554 --> 01:49:44,613
Fine.

1093
01:49:47,235 --> 01:49:48,625
Stay alert.

1094
01:49:51,066 --> 01:49:52,795
Let us brighten this firmament.

1095
01:50:09,819 --> 01:50:13,589
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?

1096
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,649
Resetting staircases.

1097
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,529
Scenery coming in.

1098
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:20,260
30 seconds to lighting change.

1099
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:28,911
30 seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area, please.

1100
01:50:34,284 --> 01:50:36,914
Rachel, up, to the right and through.

1101
01:50:37,624 --> 01:50:42,284
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet on the landing.

1102
01:50:43,195 --> 01:50:46,184
Watch your step going down.
Somebody spilled water.

1103
01:50:50,207 --> 01:50:51,296
Shall we?

1104
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:03,047
Do try to relax. I know
you must be very excited.

1105
01:51:03,649 --> 01:51:04,778
Thank you.

1106
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:11,890
Presenting the Best Song award are...

1107
01:51:12,061 --> 01:51:13,720
...Hollywood's newest couple.

1108
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:16,159
He's England's knight in shining armor.

1109
01:51:16,432 --> 01:51:19,162
She's America's queen of the night.

1110
01:51:19,402 --> 01:51:22,862
Please welcome Clive
Healy and Rachel Marron.

1111
01:51:50,978 --> 01:51:52,338
Well, Rachel....

1112
01:51:52,508 --> 01:51:56,967
I know you only came to present this
award and you'll leave when we're done.

1113
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:10,260
No, I'm very interested in
one of the awards tonight.

1114
01:52:10,731 --> 01:52:11,720
Best Actor.

1115
01:52:15,472 --> 01:52:18,771
Tonight we heard 5 songs and
the names of their creators.

1116
01:52:26,184 --> 01:52:30,124
No matter what anyone thinks.
I know you have no personal favorites.

1117
01:52:31,726 --> 01:52:33,655
The Best Song nominees are...

1118
01:52:33,865 --> 01:52:38,555
..."Clock On The Wall" by Dana S.
Lee and Sarah Spring...

1119
01:52:41,867 --> 01:52:45,567
..."Give Me Your Trust" by David
Siegel and Barbara Gordon...

1120
01:52:51,579 --> 01:52:52,979
..."l Have Nothing"...

1121
01:52:53,149 --> 01:52:55,879
..."Queen of the Night"
by Nancy Garber...

1122
01:52:59,161 --> 01:53:03,590
...and "Reflections of My Heart" from
" Hot and Cold" by Leslie Moraes.

1123
01:53:08,832 --> 01:53:11,771
All right, Clive, let's find out...

1124
01:53:13,702 --> 01:53:15,072
...who the winner is.

1125
01:53:15,343 --> 01:53:18,173
The envelope. Rachel,
shall I do the honors?

1126
01:53:29,496 --> 01:53:31,395
And the winner is:
" I Have Nothing"...

1127
01:53:31,496 --> 01:53:34,555
...from "Queen of the Night"
by Nancy Garber.

1128
01:53:41,378 --> 01:53:42,867
She's good, Frank.

1129
01:53:46,749 --> 01:53:47,808
I'm okay.

1130
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:49,968
I always said she was nuts.

1131
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,039
I'm okay, all right?

1132
01:53:52,690 --> 01:53:55,490
You're making me
into a raving lunatic!

1133
01:53:57,090 --> 01:53:58,079
God!

1134
01:53:59,492 --> 01:54:00,481
You okay?

1135
01:54:00,662 --> 01:54:01,892
Yes!

1136
01:54:02,902 --> 01:54:04,391
Fucking actresses!

1137
01:54:05,902 --> 01:54:07,661
-Where's Portman?
-Who?

1138
01:54:07,843 --> 01:54:09,772
-Portman.
-Never heard of him.

1139
01:54:16,314 --> 01:54:20,843
I'm sorry, but if you want to be in your
seat for Best Actress, you must go now.

1140
01:54:20,985 --> 01:54:24,985
I'm going as fast as I can. Why don't
you go twitch somewhere else?

1141
01:54:25,156 --> 01:54:27,626
Everything's fine. No one noticed.

1142
01:54:27,926 --> 01:54:31,325
-Everyone's jumping out of their skins.
-Bullshit.

1143
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:33,868
Farmer's making me into a lunatic!

1144
01:54:34,008 --> 01:54:36,338
-You should know--
-You're driving her crazy!

1145
01:54:36,938 --> 01:54:38,268
I know who it is.

1146
01:54:38,439 --> 01:54:40,338
-Shut up!
-He's here tonight!

1147
01:54:40,809 --> 01:54:45,178
You're a maniac! You've embarrassed
me in front of billions of people.

1148
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,280
-Wait for Frank. Honey, please.
-Three minutes!

1149
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,009
Calm the fuck down!

1150
01:54:52,191 --> 01:54:53,710
Is he coming?

1151
01:54:59,202 --> 01:55:00,562
I know who it is.

1152
01:55:00,732 --> 01:55:01,721
Portman.

1153
01:55:01,903 --> 01:55:04,373
Remember? The guy in Miami.

1154
01:55:04,903 --> 01:55:07,892
-Oh, yeah, the pencil neck!
-ls anyone coming with me?

1155
01:55:08,144 --> 01:55:12,044
After tonight, you're in charge.
He knows nothing about show business.

1156
01:55:12,214 --> 01:55:14,203
Two minutes to Best Actress.

1157
01:55:15,916 --> 01:55:17,745
You're an asshole.

1158
01:55:19,386 --> 01:55:21,485
To present the Best Actress award...

1159
01:55:22,156 --> 01:55:26,856
...we have the man who last year, won
for his performance in "South of Waco"...

1160
01:55:26,997 --> 01:55:29,986
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Mr. Tom Winston.

1161
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:42,710
Thank you, Academy.

1162
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:44,881
Did you see him?

1163
01:55:45,621 --> 01:55:48,950
-Go to the other side of the stage.
-What do I do?

1164
01:55:49,961 --> 01:55:51,251
See those people?

1165
01:55:51,532 --> 01:55:53,191
They don't need to be there.

1166
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:55,351
That guy with the camera too.

1167
01:55:55,903 --> 01:55:57,732
I'll take care of it.

1168
01:56:01,044 --> 01:56:03,374
Rachel Marron for "Queen of the Night."

1169
01:56:16,557 --> 01:56:17,546
You!

1170
01:56:20,557 --> 01:56:22,556
Rachel Marron!

1171
01:56:22,997 --> 01:56:24,826
"Queen of the Night."

1172
01:57:41,923 --> 01:57:43,392
Go to commercial.

1173
01:57:43,562 --> 01:57:45,151
He's got a gun!

1174
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:46,362
He's got a gun!

1175
01:57:48,403 --> 01:57:49,492
Get the gun!

1176
01:58:15,269 --> 01:58:17,428
-She's bleeding!
-It's not me!

1177
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:21,058
He's my bodyguard!

1178
01:58:31,721 --> 01:58:33,810
Frank! Stay with me!

1179
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:36,711
Stay with me! Come on.

1180
01:58:37,392 --> 01:58:39,722
God, hurry up!

1181
01:59:56,617 --> 01:59:57,606
How's it going?

1182
01:59:58,617 --> 01:59:59,987
It's under control.

1183
02:00:00,988 --> 02:00:02,977
It won't be the same without you.

1184
02:00:04,699 --> 02:00:06,089
How you doing?

1185
02:00:20,342 --> 02:00:22,241
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:00:24,582 --> 02:00:26,411
So you're quitting show business?

1187
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:30,113
Too bad. You had talent.

1188
02:00:34,294 --> 02:00:36,824
Fletcher, go to the plane.

1189
02:00:40,835 --> 02:00:42,205
How's the new guy?

1190
02:00:44,546 --> 02:00:46,375
He's got white hair.

1191
02:00:48,616 --> 02:00:51,675
-He's very good.
-But did you have to get me an old man?

1192
02:00:52,618 --> 02:00:54,417
I don't trust you.

1193
02:01:08,401 --> 02:01:11,570
Let's get this over with,
okay? Give me a kiss.

1194
02:01:18,483 --> 02:01:19,783
Goodbye, Rachel.

1195
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:23,072
'Bye, Frank.

1196
02:01:31,664 --> 02:01:34,324
If I should stay

1197
02:01:40,336 --> 02:01:41,805
I would only...

1198
02:01:42,747 --> 02:01:43,967
...be in...

1199
02:01:45,447 --> 02:01:46,966
...your way

1200
02:01:49,117 --> 02:01:51,747
So I'll go.

1201
02:01:51,918 --> 02:01:53,288
You okay?

1202
02:01:53,919 --> 02:01:55,918
But I know...

1203
02:01:57,759 --> 02:01:59,818
...I'll think of you.

1204
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,829
Every step of...

1205
02:02:03,301 --> 02:02:05,130
...the way

1206
02:02:11,782 --> 02:02:12,761
Wait!

1207
02:02:21,324 --> 02:02:24,653
And I will always love you

1208
02:02:41,978 --> 02:02:43,967
You, my darling you

1209
02:02:48,989 --> 02:02:50,578
Bittersweet...

1210
02:02:52,429 --> 02:02:54,048
...memories

1211
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,189
That is all...

1212
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:01,060
...I'm taking with me

1213
02:03:03,301 --> 02:03:05,070
So goodbye.

1214
02:03:06,612 --> 02:03:08,912
Please don't cry.

1215
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,212
We both know...

1216
02:03:12,453 --> 02:03:15,382
...I'm not what you need

1217
02:03:23,325 --> 02:03:26,224
And I will always love you

1218
02:03:37,748 --> 02:03:41,648
Our speaker this evening has
been a lone courageous voice.

1219
02:03:41,948 --> 02:03:46,407
He alone has challenged those
who have linked organized crime...

1220
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,819
...with legitimate business
throughout our state.

1221
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:51,959
Welcome, Congressman.

1222
02:03:59,502 --> 02:04:03,911
First our benediction will be delivered
by the Reverend Phillip Hardy...

1223
02:04:04,143 --> 02:04:07,843
...of the First Presbyterian
Church of lowa Rapids.

1224
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:13,913
Heavenly Father...

1225
02:04:14,385 --> 02:04:18,085
...please bless us today as we
meet in friendship and duty.

1226
02:04:19,165 --> 02:04:22,795
And, Lord, whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take...

1227
02:04:22,936 --> 02:04:25,865
...Iet them never be
without Your sanctuary.

1228
02:04:26,867 --> 02:04:28,526
We know in our hearts...

1229
02:04:28,707 --> 02:04:32,106
...that though we may pass through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1230
02:04:32,307 --> 02:04:34,006
...You are with us...

1231
02:04:34,178 --> 02:04:36,808
...guiding and protecting us.

1232
02:04:37,878 --> 02:04:39,108
Amen.
