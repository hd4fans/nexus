2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,440
生命不可思议的旅程
The incredible journey of life

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,070
从出生，经历婴儿期，童年期，青春期，成年
From birth through infancy, childhood, puberty, adulthood

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,280
逐渐成熟直到老年
And the slow maturity to old age

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,320
这是我们生命的故事
This is the story of our lives

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,220
从独特的视角，从身体内部揭示身体是如何运作
From the unique perspective, deep inside how body is working

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,180
这是一个人类个体生命的旅程
This is the journey of a human life

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,920
从外，至内
From the outside, in.

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,580
胎儿在子宫内发育
A fetus develops in the womb

10
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,730
这个惊人的40周旅程，经历了从一个单细胞到临盆婴儿的全部过程
It's astonishing 40-week journey from a single cell to a baby ready to be born.

11
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,970
它的身体是微观设计的奇迹
Its body is a miracle of microscopic design

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:35,990
微小而完美的器官。每一个都由数十亿完美工作的细胞组成。
Tiny, perfectly formed organs. Each made up of billions of perfectly functioning cells

13
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,580
这些细胞是我们身体的基石
These cells are the building blocks of our bodies.

14
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:51,440
他们让我们成为人类。一百万亿个细胞都在和谐中工作着。
They make us what we are. A hundred thousand billion cells all working in harmony

15
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,080
在每一个细胞中都有相同而特别的引擎
Inside every cell is the same extraordinary engine.

16
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,080
一台能告诉每个细胞如何生长的机器
The machine that tells each cell how to grow

17
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,080
以及告诉他们应该实现什么样的功能
and what functions to perform.

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,110
每个人的DNA都是独一无二的
DNA is unique to every person.

19
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,810
它是化学物质构成的，形成新生命的指令的蓝图
A chemical blueprint of instructions that creates each new life.

20
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,600
这个婴儿已经准备好降临这个世界了
This baby is ready to enter the world.

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,720
作为一个人，他即将开始他的旅程
A new born person who's journey is about to begin.

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,150
这个旅程即从挑战开始：呼吸，或者死亡
The journey starts with the challenge, breath, or die.

23
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,220
它的肺部还从未呼吸过
These lungs have never breathed before.

24
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,500
肺里还仍然充满了保护肺部长达9个月的羊水
They are still full of amniotic fluid that protected them for 9 long months.

25
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,990
这个新生儿面临“淹死”的威胁
The new-born is endanger of drowning

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,450
随即，身体进入了“生存模式”
Then, the body kicks into survival mode.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,450
位于肾脏上部的肾上腺释放出肾上腺素，随血液传递至全身
The adrenal glands, right above the kidneys, send adrenalin surging around the body

28
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,680
肾上腺素激活了肺部
It shocks the lungs into live.

29
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,680
呼吸所需的肌肉开始痉挛
Muscles we need to breathe suddenly start to spasm.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,550
于是我们第一次呼吸
And we take our first breath.

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,950
这是我们一生中最重要的一次呼吸。七百万次的第一次。
It's the most important breath of our lives - the first of 700 million.

32
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,100
我们活着的每一秒肺部都在抽气
Our lungs will pump air every single second as long as we live

33
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,100
空气冲下呼吸道，经过数千的分支管道
Air rushes down the wind pipe. down thousands of branching tubes.

34
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,400
最终进入将近三千万微小的称之为“肺泡”（Alveoli）的空气袋中
And into nearly 30 million tiny air sacks - alveoli.

35
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:21,470
这些气袋将氧气推入我们的血液中，并从中抽取二氧化碳随我们呼出
These air sacks pull oxygen into our blood, and pump out the carbon dioxide we exhale with every breath.

36
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,000
80年的生命中从未停止过
and they do it non-stop for 80 years

37
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,600
出生的那一刻开始，万事万物都发生了改变
At the moment of birth, everything changes.

38
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,250
母亲和婴儿之间的物质连接第一次中断了
The physical link between mother and baby is broken for the first time.

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,080
出生的第一个小时发生了快速的变化
The first hour brings rapid change.

40
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,530
婴儿身上所有的器官都被迫适应在子宫外存活
All the baby's organs have to adapt to life outside the womb

41
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,860
这是一个富有挑战性并且很危险的时刻
It's a challenging and risky time

42
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,730
在这个年龄，心脏不比核桃大
At this age, the heart is no bigger than a walnut.

43
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,560
心脏已经在子宫中工作了8个月。然而现在，心脏却有可能导致停止的缺陷。
It's been pumping in the womb for 8 months. But now it has flaws that could be fail.

44
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,530
在主动脉和心脏中有两个空洞
Two holes, one in aorta and one in the heart.

45
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,580
在子宫里时，这两个洞让血液能绕开我们还不在工作状态的肺部
In the womb, they diverted blood away from our inactive lungs.

46
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,580
然而现在我们需要肺部，所以这两个洞必须关闭密封
Now that we need the lungs. The holes seal shut.

47
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,590
心脏正常的工作着
The heart is working normally

48
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,650
将血液输送到成百上千
pumping blood through tens of thousands

49
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,390
英里的血管中
of miles of blood vessels

50
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,570
其他系统也在准备中
Other systems are also gearing up.

51
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,490
消化道
The digestive track

52
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,250
已经为第一餐而清空，腾出空间
is ready to clear itself out to make room for its first meal.

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,140
肠道充满消化过的羊水和死细胞
The bowel is full of digested amniotic fluid and dead cells

54
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,000
这种粘稠的墨绿色沥青状物质称谓“胎粪”(Meconium)
A sticky green black tar like material called Meconium.

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,500
胎粪是具有腐蚀性的物质。如果在分娩时不幸落入婴儿肺中
It's corrosive stuff. If it ends up in the babies’ lungs during labor

56
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,270
就会危害到精巧的肺部结构
It can attack the delicate lining

57
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,560
然而在肠道中，胎粪是无害的。
But here in the gut, Meconium is harmless. The digestive track

58
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,270
消化道在几天内就能将其排空。
flushes it out within days.

59
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,860
随着时光的流逝，越来越多更为复杂的系统开始启动
As time passes, more sophisticated systems starts to kick-in.

60
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,860
下一个挑战是寒冷
Our next challenge is the cold.

61
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,160
在子宫内的温度是100华氏度，摄氏37度 然而在家中
It was 100 degrees in the womb here at home,

62
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,520
仅为17摄氏度的气温冲击着身体系统
65 degree room temperature is a shock to the system

63
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,390
控制温度的部分
The area that controls temperature is

64
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,690
位于大脑中较深的区域
deep within the base of our brains.

65
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,130
当一个成人感到太冷
when an adult is too cold

66
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:32,020
或是太热时，这个区域发出指令到身体，以制造更多或更少的能量
or hot, this area sends out instructions for ourselves to produce more or less energy.

67
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,260
这个区域称为“下丘脑”（Hypothalamus）
It's called the Hypothalamus. And like all our

68
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,270
同我们其他所有的器官一样，在这个年龄
other organs at this age

69
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,650
下丘脑仍未发育
It's still immature.

70
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:49,750
大脑处在压力中。每秒进行一百万亿次计算，仅仅为了让身体工作
The brain is under pressure. Making 100 trillion calculations per second just to keep our bodies functioning.

71
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,660
然而它却还在学习如何做到。所以我们处在“体温过高”（Hyperthemia）的危险中
But it's still learning how. And now we are in danger of Hyperthermia.

72
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,920
红外线摄影机展示了我们的身体在损失宝贵的体热的时候
An inferred camera shows the struggle to keep warm

73
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,580
如何挣扎着保持温暖 黄色区域是我们失去热量最多的地方
as we lose precious body heat. The yellow areas show where we lose the most.

74
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,180
幸好我们准备好了。 在我们的血管和重要器官周围
Luckily we are prepared. A layer of special tissue

75
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,620
环绕着一层很特殊的组织，不停产生热量
around our blood vessels and vital organs actively generates heat.

76
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,400
这就是脂肪
It's fat.

77
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,480
然而这是一种特殊的脂肪
But this is irregular fat.

78
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,480
称为棕色脂肪。通常只在冬眠动物体内存在。
It's brown fat. A specialized type usually found in hibernating animals

79
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,740
脂肪外包裹着特别的产热细胞
It's packed with special heat generating cells.

80
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:52,420
最终，大部分这种脂肪都会溶解。因为下丘脑逐渐成熟，肝脏和其他器官
Eventually, most of this fat will melt away. As the Hypothalamus matures, and the lever and other organs take on the job

81
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,550
逐渐接管热量的产生
of generating heat

82
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,700
仅仅几个小时大，我们对周围的世界
Just hours old, we know almost

83
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,310
还一无所知
nothing about the world. Everything we

84
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,390
我们所依赖的一切仅仅是直觉
we do relies on instinct

85
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:27,140
感觉现在还仅仅是反射而已。 正常情况下，我们对呼吸的控制并不多于对吮吸的控制
feeling is a reflex. Normally, we have no more control over sucking than the urge to breath.

86
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,300
这是乳汁第一次经由“食管”（Oesophagus）到达胃中
This is milk on its first journey down via Esophagus to the stomach.

87
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,770
母亲的乳汁比“终极”超级食品更为重要
Mother's milk is much more than the ultimate super-food.

88
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,350
乳汁同样保护我们免受隐藏威胁的危害
It also protects us from hidden danger.

89
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,220
在子宫外，细菌无处不在
Outside the womb, bacteria are everywhere.

90
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,420
无形，并且有致命的可能
Invisible and potentially deadly.

91
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,660
我们仅仅一天大的皮肤不断受到攻击
Our day-old skin is under constant attack.

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,810
在我们的体内和体表，存在的细菌比细胞的10倍还多
There are 10 times more bacteria than human cells in and on our bodies

93
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,440
然而我们的免疫系统还未发育成熟。因此，我们自己不能抵抗感染。
Our immune systems aren't developed yet. So we can't fight infections for ourselves.

94
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,000
令人惊讶的是，我们的母亲帮助我们
Amazingly, Our mother

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,590
借由母乳消灭他们
fights them for us through her milk.

96
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,442
母亲和婴儿间紧密的联系
 The close contact between mother and baby

97
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:56,754
意味着攻击婴儿的细菌同时也攻击母亲
means she observes the same germs that attacking us

98
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,230
她的免疫系统产生抗体
Her immune system creates antibodies.

99
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:04,292
接着，借由母乳，她将这些抗体传送给我们
Then she delivers those antibodies back to us, in her milk

100
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,433
直到我们自己的免疫系统发育完成之前
Until our own immune system developed

101
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,488
她会保护我们安全
She will keep us save.

102
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,714
现在是踏入世界的时候了
It's time to take on the world.

103
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,791
从出生到现在已经四周了
It's been 4 weeks since birth.

104
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,065
婴儿已经喝了将近30品脱的牛奶 （14升）
The baby has drunk nearly 30 pints of milk.

105
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,818
并且增加了2磅（将近1公斤）的体重 -- 占其体重的四分之一
And it has put on 2 pounds - 1/4 of its body weight

106
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:11,783
现在是到户外活动的时间了
It's time for its first trip outside.

107
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:17,048
一个月大
1 Month

108
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,267
哪怕是到附近小商铺，也能让婴儿的感官超载
Even a visit to the grocery store can overload the senses

109
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:29,127
嘈杂，明亮，而且充满各种气味
It's noisy, bright and smelly

110
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:43,454
鼻子一直在工作着
The nose is working over time.

111
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,437
在鼻腔内的高处，特化的神经细胞悬挂在气流中
High up inside, specialized nerves dangle in the air stream

112
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,997
他们检测空气里的化学成分
They detect chemicals in the air

113
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:56,275
随后发送电信号给大脑
And send electrical signal to the brain

114
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:59,617
由大脑解释成嗅觉
which interprets the signals as smells

115
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:03,963
这些神经超级敏感
The nerves are super-sensitive.

116
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,385
每一种气味都是新的感觉
Every smell is a new sensation.

117
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,767
同样的事情也发生在听觉上。奇怪的新世界
The same goes for our hearing. Strange new world

118
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,969
奇怪的新声音
Strange new sounds.

119
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,662
声波振动鼓膜
Sound waves vibrate the air drum.

120
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:44,494
在鼓膜另一侧，这些细小的骨头，“听小骨”（Ossicles）
On the other side of the air drum, these tiny bones, the Ossicles,

121
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,281
随之振动
vibrate in response.

122
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,582
这些骨头是体内最小的骨头
They are the smallest bones in the body.

123
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:52,178
然而没有他们 我们什么也听不见
but without them, we will never hear a thing.

124
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:57,471
听小骨利用杠杆原理放大震动
They use leverage to amplify the vibrations.

125
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:00,390
击打鼓膜22次
Hitting the air drum 22 times

126
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:10,549
已扩大的震动现在进入内耳，或者“耳蜗”（Cochlea）
The amplified vibrations now enter the inner ear, or Cochlea.

127
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,868
这里排列着精巧的纤毛
It's lined with delicate hairs.

128
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:18,857
当震动经过时，纤毛跟着震动
When vibrations pass through, the hairs vibrate.

129
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:25,668
在基部，有无数脆弱的纤毛，负责高频率的声音
At the base are the fragile hairs for high frequency sounds.

130
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,800
而在顶部，则是负责低频声音的纤毛
At the top, low frequency hairs.

131
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:33,669
每一个都比头发细200倍
Each one, 200 times thinner than our hair on our head.

132
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:45,853
然而，随着时间的推移，大音量的声音会损坏这些纤毛
Over time, loud noises will damage these hairs.

133
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:49,227
但在当前这个年龄，纤毛是完美的
But at this age, they are perfect.

134
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,692
而我们的听力也永远不会再像现在这么好
Our hearing will never be this good, again.

135
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,755
视力却有所不同
The story is different for eye sight.

136
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:05,260
我们出生时，视力尚未发育
We are born with very underdeveloped vision.

137
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,201
哪怕一个月大时，世界对我们来说仍然模糊不清
Even at one month, the world is blurred.

138
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,073
并且大部分是黑白的
And mostly black and white.

139
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:16,853
我们视力的每一个方面都是初级的
Every aspect of our vision is rudimentary.

140
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:27,078
眼内的肌肉还未成熟。我们还不能朝着想要的方向看。
The eye muscles are immature. Keeping us from pointing your eyes where we want to.

141
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:39,518
在眼内，调节“镜头”的肌肉也无法运动，眼睛无法对焦
Inside the eye, the lens muscles still can't focus.

142
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:42,715
“镜头”颠倒传递过来的图像
And the lens flips the image it receives.

143
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,932
我们一生中所看到的世界，都是上下颠倒的
All through life, we see the world upside down.

144
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,603
图像在我们脑中得到调整
The picture only gets reoriented in our brains.

145
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:59,030
现在，图像在视网膜（Retina）上
Right now, the picture is on the Retina.

146
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:01,056
视网膜在眼球后部
The screen at the back of the eye.

147
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,063
视网膜上有两种细胞
The Retina has two types of cells.

148
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,044
视杆（Rods）细胞和视锥（Cones）细胞
Rods and Cones

149
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,491
他们将撞在他们身上的光转化为电信号
Which transform the light that hits them into electric signals

150
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:15,550
视锥检测颜色信息
The Cones detect color information.

151
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:18,072
然而此时视锥还未发育
But because they are not developed yet.

152
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:22,418
出生的头一个月，我们只能看见黑色和白色
We see mostly in black and white during our first month.

153
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:28,557
视觉信号沿着两根较粗神经，从视网膜出发到达大脑下方
From the Retina, the signals travel along 2 thick nerves under the brain.

154
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:32,583
神经的尽头是我们处理视觉信息的区域
At the back is where we process visual information.

155
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,225
当图像到达时，真正的挑战开始了
When the image arrives, the real challenge begins.

156
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:41,904
我们不成熟的大脑还未学会如何解释数据
Our immature brains haven't learned to interpret the data yet.

157
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,825
然而我们学习飞速
That's changing fast.

158
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,755
两个月大时我们已经可以分辨颜色和形状
At 2 months we can distinguish colors and shapes.

159
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,252
四个月时，我们能识别出母亲的脸
At 4 months, we can identify our mother's face.

160
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:15,041
八个月大时，我们已经有了20/20（近似于5.0）的视力 注：20/20的视力表示在20英尺的距离能看清正常的物体
By 8 months, we have 20/20 vision. (If you have 20/20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance.)

161
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,948
随着视力日趋完美，我们也急速成长
Along with our perfect eye sight, comes a grow spirt

162
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:30,013
我们开始增肥
We start packing on pounds.

163
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:33,883
每个月我们都增加占身体1/4的体重
We add 1/4 to our body weight every month.

164
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,806
三个月大时，生长变缓慢了
After 3 month, it slows down.

165
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:42,844
幸运的是，如果我们持续那么快的生长下去
Lucky for us. If we kept growing that fast,

166
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:47,183
四岁时我们能达到150吨重
we weight 150 tons by age 4

167
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,876
与一头蓝鲸相当
the same as a blue whale.

168
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:52,959
八个月
8 Month

169
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,968
八个月时，我们所有感官都正常工作了
At 8 month, all our senses work.

170
00:17:56,422 --> 00:18:00,581
我们开始探索这个世界。而我们最常用的感官是
We are beginning to explore the world. And the sense we use most

171
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,158
触觉
is touch

172
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,610
摸到太烫的东西
Touch something too hot

173
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,339
皮肤里的温度感受器就给手臂发送神经信号沿着手臂向上
And temperature sensors in the skin send nerve signals raising up the arm

174
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,214
信号传导到脊髓中枢神经
Up to spinal core

175
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:23,891
直到大脑中
and into the brain

176
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:28,552
信号能达到200迈/小时 （300公里/小时）
All at 200 miles per hour

177
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,410
大脑检测到信号
The brain detects the signal

178
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,666
并处理为疼痛
interprets it as pain

179
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:42,469
然后，向肌肉发送信号
and fires another signal back to the muscles

180
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,369
让我们把手拿开
we move the hand away

181
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,582
传感神经受体遍布我们全身
We have sensoring nerve receptors all over our skin

182
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:54,870
但是身体的某些区域比其他区域更为敏感
But some areas are more sensitive than others

183
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,957
手部，脸部和嘴
The hands, face and mouth.

184
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:04,626
舌头上，有9000个受体
There are 9000 sensory receptors on the tongue along.

185
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:08,002
这也是为什么婴儿总喜欢用嘴试探周围的世界
Which is why babies use their mouth to explore

186
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,002
但是还有另一个原因导致婴儿的不安
But there is another reason for all the annoying.

187
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:22,472
在他们的嘴里现在有一种疼痛
Something painful is happening inside the baby's mouth.

188
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,653
她的第一批牙正在生长出来
Her first teeth are coming through

189
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:31,963
我们仍在子宫里的时候，乳牙（Milk teeth）就已经深藏在牙龈（Gum）中
Milk teeth form deep in our gums while we were still in the womb

190
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:38,036
现在他们一个接一个破茧而出
Now, one by one, they burst through

191
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,594
这很疼，但是却有进展
It's painful, but it's progress.

192
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,327
从八个月，到80岁的旅程里
At 8 months into life's 80-year journey

193
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:52,490
身上的“传感器”都在满负荷运作
The sensors are operating at full capacity

194
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,911
每一种感觉都是一个新的惊喜
Every sensation is a new surprise.

195
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:05,681
有了新的牙齿，她可以吃更多种固体食物了
And with her new teeth, she can take on more solid foods.

196
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,594
消化始于口中
Digestion starts in the mouth

197
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,006
牙齿研磨食物
Teeth grind up the food

198
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:18,797
舌头下的特殊腺体分泌唾液
Then special glands under the tongue pump out saliva

199
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:28,109
唾液帮助瓦解和润滑食物。食物经过12个小时才能穿过13英尺（4米）的肠道
To help break down and lubricate the food on its 12 hour 13 foot journey through the gut

200
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:33,652
食物要经过胃，到达盘旋的小肠
It'll pass from the stomach into the coils of the small intestine

201
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,461
在最终到达大肠前
before finally passing into the large intestine

202
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:47,038
肌肉一波又一波的不停收缩，保持食物移动
Waves of contracting muscle keep the food moving

203
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:50,312
这个过程称之为“肠蠕动”（Peristalsis）
A process called Peristalsis

204
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:59,766
这种收缩运动是如此强大
This contractions are so powerful

205
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,784
以至于我们甚至可以倒立着吃东西
we can even eat up side down

206
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,297
有史以来这是第一次，我们借由一种新的高分辨率摄像机
For the first time, a new camera shows a high definition view

207
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:15,791
窥视食物是如何进入我们的体内，到达胃中
of how food travels through our bodies and into our stomachs.

208
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,934
食物要进入胃中，必须先经过胃顶部的一个洞口
Food enters the stomach through a hole at the top

209
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:47,029
我们的胃就是一个肌肉袋子
The stomach is a bag of muscle that churns

210
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,307
 将食物搅拌，压扁，挤烂，成为液体
 squashes and squeezes food into liquid

211
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:59,176
同时，胃酸将食物分解
At the same time, acids brake the food down

212
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:03,895
胃壁受到内层粘膜的保护
The stomach walls protect themselves with the lining of mucous

213
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:09,586
没有内层粘膜的话，胃酸甚至可以消化胃本身
Without it, the acids could digest parts of stomach itself

214
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,777
导致胃溃疡（Stomach Ulcers）
causing Stomach Ulcers

215
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:28,039
大约一小时后，胃将已经分解的食物经由一个微小的洞挤出
About an hour later, the stomach squeezes the broken down food out through a tiny hole

216
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,103
这个洞成为“幽门括约肌”（Pyloric Sphincter）
called the Pyloric Sphincter

217
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,992
食物进入小肠（small intestine）
The food enters the small intestine.

218
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,221
我们在这11英尺（约3.5米）缠绕的管道中吸收绝大部分的营养
An 11 foot coil of tube where we absorb most of the nutrients.

219
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:55,724
小肠的内壁上
The interior wall of small intestine

220
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,107
有着数以百万的微观结构
is lined with millions of microscopic projections

221
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,172
成为“小肠绒毛”（Villi）
called Villi

222
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,052
这些绒毛增加了肠道的面积
These increase the surface area of the gut

223
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,796
使我们更容易的吸收营养
making it easier to absorb nutrients

224
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:18,816
首先，胰腺（Pancreas）分泌出汁液中和胃酸
First the Pancreas pumps out a juice that neutralizes stomach acid

225
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,455
接着，肝脏分泌出胆汁（bile）分解脂肪为微小液滴
Then bile from the lever brakes down the fat into tiny droplets

226
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,990
这些小液滴更容易被小肠吸收
Smaller droplets are easier for the intestine to absorb.

227
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,917
大约一个半小时后
After 1 hour and half

228
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:39,801
小肠从食物中吸收了大部分的营养
The small intestine has absorbed most of the nutrients from the food

229
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:44,005
现在到了让残余物质继续往前的时候了
It's time for what remains to move on.

230
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,639
这些剩余物质通过这里进入大肠
It enters the large intestine through this

231
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,201
这是“回盲肠括约肌”（Ileocecal Sphincter）
the Ileocecal Sphincter

232
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:54,801
它是帮我们阻止食物倒流的阀门
a valve that keeps our food from going back where it came from

233
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:05,981
现在的残余物是无用的食物以及小肠壁上死亡的细胞的混合
What's left is a mix of waste food and dead cells from the walls of the gut

234
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:21,184
而大肠的主要工作是从残余物内提取水分
The large intestine's main job is to extract water from it

235
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,935
大量的细菌也生活在大肠里
lots of bacteria live here too

236
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,488
但这并不是因为受到感染
but it isn't because of an infection

237
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,481
我们实际上需要这些细菌
we actually need them

238
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:36,208
他们产生酶来帮助分解食物中复杂的碳水化合物
They produce enzymes that brake down complex carbohydrates in our food

239
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,770
而我们自身无法分解碳水化合物
carbohydrates we couldn't otherwise digest

240
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,943
最终，大约12个小时后
Finally, after about 12 hours

241
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:53,469
我们排出第一餐的剩余物
we expel what's left of our first meal

242
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,734
12个月
12 Months

243
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,689
一岁大的我们
One year old

244
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,149
我们可以移动了。我们已经将爬行练习至完美
We are mobile. We've perfected the art of crawling

245
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:31,775
我们的骨头也更加强壮
Our bones are stronger.

246
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,683
他们也需要变得更强壮，因为我们正在变得很重
They need to be. We are getting pretty heavy.

247
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:42,390
出生时，我们的骨骼主要是“软骨”（Cartilage）
At birth, the skeleton is mostly Cartilage.

248
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:45,385
同形成耳朵的物质一样
The same material as our ears

249
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,672
软骨是很灵活的
Cartilage is flexible.

250
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:51,993
因为是软骨 我们才能从产道中挤出来
It's what allows us to squeeze through the birth canal

251
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,739
但是出生后，我们柔软的骨骼是一个问题
but after birth, our soft skeletons are a problem

252
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,566
他们需要硬化来支撑生长中的身体
they need to be rigid to support our growing bodies

253
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,690
并且保护我们的重要器官
and protect our vital organs

254
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:19,287
所以，从一出生起，软骨就开始硬化
So right from birth, the Cartilage starts to harden

255
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,212
有一种特殊的细胞称为“成骨细胞”（Osteoblasts）
special cells called Osteoblasts

256
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:32,885
将矿物质放在软骨上，使之成为硬骨
lay down minerals that turn soft cartilage into hard bone

257
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,880
一些骨头甚至会融合
some bones even fuse together

258
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:43,360
出生时，我们的头骨版之间有一个空洞
At birth, we have gaps between the plates of the skull

259
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:46,206
这使颅骨在出生的时候可以变形
which allow the skull to deform during birth

260
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:52,695
在我们出生后的一年里，这些空隙逐渐愈合
through our first year, these gaps gradually close

261
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:54,968
直到颅骨完全成型
until the skull is finally complete

262
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:01,325
骨架发育完成后，我们就有了到处行走的欲望
as our skeletons develop, so does our desire to get around

263
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:05,466
我们即将到达生命的一个重要里程碑
we are about to hit one of the major milestones in life

264
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,841
双脚站立
standing on two feet

265
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,591
站立的关键并不是强壮，而是平衡
the key isn't strength, it's balance

266
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:17,897
而站立的秘密深藏在耳中
and the secret to standing is hidden deep in our ears

267
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:25,505
在负责听觉的听小骨后方
beyond the ossicles - the bones we use for hearing

268
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:29,243
内耳由三个环形结构构成
the inner ear is made up of three looping structures

269
00:27:30,145 --> 00:27:32,349
每个环都跟10美分一样大 （直径1.8厘米）
each loop is the size of a dime

270
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,662
他们能涵盖所有的三个平面
and they are oriented to cover all three plains

271
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:44,758
这些“半规管”是我们耳朵的一部分，但却不是用在听觉上的
these semicircular canals are part of our ears but they have nothing to do with hearing

272
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,863
充满液体，告诉我们什么是上
they are filled with liquid. and they tell us what's up

273
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:50,314
什么是下
what's down

274
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,322
和什么是水平
and what's on the level

275
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:07,207
半规管里的液体冲刷着管壁上的感觉绒毛
the liquid inside slashes against sensor hairs lining the tubes

276
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:11,280
绒毛向大脑发送数据，告诉我们目前的朝向是什么
the hair send data to the brain about how we are oriented

277
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:12,853
以及我们的运动方向
and our direction of movement

278
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:17,642
他们是负责平衡的器官
these are our organs of balance

279
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:40,729
一旦掌握了平衡，我们又离行走近了一步
once we've mastered balance, we are one step closer to walking

280
00:28:55,958 --> 00:29:01,380
现在再也没有东西限制我们的行动和学习了
now there's no limit to where we can go and what we can learn

281
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,175
从婴儿到幼儿
from a baby to a toddler

282
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,087
我们装载着差不多成形的耳朵
we are embarking on our most formative ears

283
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:16,923
到了我们该把生长中的大脑
a time when we will put our growing brains

284
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,645
和发育中的免疫系统
and developing immune systems

285
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:19,807
投入测试的时候了
to the test

286
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:26,543
两岁
age 2

287
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:31,308
我们在婴儿期幸存了下来，并且已经能够双足站立
we've survived infancy and can stand on our own two feet

288
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:36,109
接下来迎接我们的将是人类独有的挑战
next stop is a uniquely human challenge

289
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:37,980
学会说话
learning to talk

290
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,506
[嘻嘻] 超可爱啊
[xixi]

291
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,800
两岁
2 Years

292
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,984
说话，需要大量的大脑活动
talking takes a lot of brain power

293
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:57,321
一个两岁小孩一天能记住10个新单词
a 2-year-old learns 10 new words a day

294
00:29:57,282 --> 00:29:58,865
[小女孩:醒过来！]
[girl:wake up]

295
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:02,112
这是“布罗卡氏区”（Broca's area）
this is Broca's area

296
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:05,656
该区位于大脑的一侧，负责产生语言
the region at the side of the brain used for speech production

297
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,025
以及理解
and comprehension

298
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:24,651
语言区别了我们和其他动物 （不是劳动，使用工具 - -！）
language is what separates us from other animals

299
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,915
我们能相互交换复杂的想法和意见
we exchange complex thoughts and ideas

300
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:33,642
并教导我们的孩子---不光是展示
and teach our children not just by showing

301
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:35,434
而是“告诉”
but by telling

302
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:51,895
随着我们大脑的发展，我们得到了其他人类特有的能力
as our brains develop, we gain other uniquely human qualities

303
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:57,335
我们知道我们自己是谁
we are aware our own identities

304
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:58,588
以及形成了个性
and individuality

305
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:02,775
我们开始为自己着想
we gain the ability to think for ourselves

306
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:09,135
五岁
5 Years

307
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,143
我们也开始形成记忆
and we're forming memories

308
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,213
记忆能持续一生
that will last a life time

309
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,876
比如我们上学的第一天
like our first day at school

310
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,779
我们也许能记住我们身边发生的事情
we may remember what was going on around us

311
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:29,708
但是真正的行动却发生在身体内部
but the real action is happening inside

312
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:37,289
大脑是由1000亿神经细胞组成物质团
the brain is a mass of 100 billion nerve cells

313
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:41,037
在神经之间产生的电力
between them, they generate enough electricity

314
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,123
足以保持一个灯泡电量一天
to keep a light bulb burning for a day

315
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,627
细胞使用电脉冲通信
the cells communicate using electric impulses

316
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:54,196
每一个脉冲都是思想和记忆的微小片段
each impulse is a tiny fragment of thought or memory

317
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,373
当我们听到一个新词
when we hear a new word

318
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,615
[背景:我爷爷的。。。]
[background: my grandpa's ...]

319
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:05,415
我们的耳朵将声音转化成电脉冲送到大脑
our ears convert the sound into electrical impulses in our brains

320
00:32:11,184 --> 00:32:14,877
大脑之所以能学习，是因为脑细胞之间的连结
the brain can learn because the connections between brain cells

321
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,334
并不是永久性的
aren't permanent

322
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,884
大脑能够重新连结
the brain rewire itself

323
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,674
神经细胞长出如同藤蔓的须，称为“轴突”（Axons）
nerve cells send out tendrils called Axons

324
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:28,344
持续不断的形成新的连接
constantly forming new connections

325
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,155
细胞之间连接的地方有一个微小的缝隙
the cells meet at a tiny gap

326
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:36,320
称为“突触”（Synapse）
called a Synapse

327
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:41,185
化学物质在缝隙中充当桥梁，让脉冲能够继续传送
Chemicals bridge the gap to allow the impulse to continue the chain

328
00:32:47,408 --> 00:32:49,634
新的连结形成一种模式
the new connections form a pattern

329
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,661
最终形成新的记忆
a new memory

330
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,242
我们通过在脑细胞间建立新的连接来学习
we learn by making new connections between brain cells

331
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,355
通过重复加强这种连结
and then reinforcing them through repetition

332
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,239
加强越强
the stronger the reinforcement

333
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,766
记忆越有可能保存下来
the more likely the memory will stay

334
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:14,396
9岁
9 Years

335
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,929
[老师: “电池”这个词是什么意思?]
[teacher: what is the word "battery" mean?]

336
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,805
当有人要我们唤醒记忆
when someone asks us to recall that memory

337
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:25,831
同样的轴突模式启动，记忆被取出
the same pattern of Axons fires, and the memory comes alive

338
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:46,920
大脑负责发送信息给驱动手臂肌肉的神经
our brains respond by sending messages to the nerves that drive the muscles in our arms

339
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,929
举手
we raise our hands

340
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:50,781
[女孩:我会，老师!]
[girl: Me Miss!]

341
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,634
在童年期我们大脑的主要任务是学习
in childhood our brains are primed to learn

342
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,131
并且迅速生长
and they are growing fast

343
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,708
快速的生长使我们的大脑很容易形成新的连结
the rapid growth allows our brains to easily form new connections

344
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:05,432
这种能力随着年龄增长而减退
and the ability that will fade with age

345
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,831
当我们的大脑在不断学习的同时
and while our brains keep learning

346
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:13,859
我们的身体也在做同样的事情
our bodies do the same

347
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:18,854
免疫系统的任务是学习识别感染
it's the immune system's job to learn to recognize infections

348
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,942
每一种进入身体的细菌
every germ that enters the body

349
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,170
都带着产生疾病的潜在威胁
carries the potential thread of disease

350
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:36,962
但首先，细菌必须要能够进去
but first, the germ has to get there

351
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,270
免疫行为并不是从我们身体里面开始的
immunity doesn't begin inside our bodies

352
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:44,749
我们从细菌接触我们的那一刹那开始，就已经开始与其斗争
we start fighting germs the moment they touch us

353
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:49,198
我们有一整个“军火库”来抵抗感染
we have an arsenal of defenses against infection

354
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:55,792
我们的眉毛和睫毛
our eye brows and eyelashes

355
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,299
耳毛
ear hairs

356
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:00,130
和鼻毛
and nasal hairs

357
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,341
能够捕捉到通过空气传播的细菌
catch airborne bacteria

358
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:09,331
汗液，泪液和黏液将他们冲走
sweat, tears and mucous wash them off

359
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,096
我们的皮肤不断地脱落表层细胞
our skin constantly sheds its top layer of cells

360
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:16,105
这些细胞沾染着细菌
taking bacteria with it

361
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:22,229
口腔特别容易受伤害
the mouth is a specially vulnerable

362
00:35:22,438 --> 00:35:25,693
但这里我们也全副武装，随时准备开火
here too we are armed and ready to fire

363
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,396
每一次喷出的唾液都含有“溶菌酶”（Lysozyme）
each squirt of saliva contains Lysozyme

364
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,150
一种专门用来破坏细菌的酶
an enzyme specially targeted to destroy bacteria

365
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:38,573
唾液腺很小
our saliva glands are tiny

366
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:43,345
然而，他们每天产生将近半加仑（约1.5升，相当于一大瓶可乐）唾液
yet they produce nearly half a gallon of saliva every single day

367
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:57,723
有时，病原体（pathogen）冲破这些外部防御
sometimes, a pathogen break through these external defenses

368
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:02,199
我们还不成熟的免疫系统作出反应，以防止感染
and our immature immune system reacts to prevent infection

369
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,614
微小的病毒随我们的血液传播
tiny viruses travel through our blood

370
00:36:08,654 --> 00:36:11,699
探测表皮细胞脆弱的迹象
and probe our skin cells for signs of weakness

371
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,260
病毒劫持一个细胞
the virus hijacks a cell

372
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,075
并在其内部制造成千上万的拷贝
and manufactures thousands of copies of it

373
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,811
之后，被感染的细胞破裂
then the infected cell ruptures

374
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,777
在体内传播更多的病毒
spreading even more viruses around the body

375
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,603
这次，这种特别的病毒会引起皮疹（rash）
this particular virus causes a rash

376
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:43,381
水痘（chicken pox）
chicken pox

377
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:51,739
而由感染带来的发热则是身体在反抗的迹象
the fever that comes with infection is a sign that the body is fighting back

378
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:55,631
热量减缓疾病的蔓延
heat slows down the spread of the disease

379
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:58,420
因为病毒在热的环境下不能很好的复制
because viruses don't reproduce well when its hot

380
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,980
所以免疫系统这时开始行动
the immune system kicks into action

381
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:22,945
白血球抓住被感染的细胞
white blood cells latch onto infected cells

382
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,567
注入有毒的蛋白质
and pump in poisonous proteins

383
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:29,646
杀死细胞的同时，也杀死病毒
which kills the cell and the viruses

384
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:45,531
硬壳皮肤疱疹是免疫系统
crusty skin blister signal the battle waved

385
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,177
和病毒斗争的信号
between the immune system and its viral ocellates xxx

386
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:55,495
每一个水泡都包含了细胞碎屑和数十万病毒残骸
each one contain cellular debris and the remains of a hundred thousand viruses

387
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:11,341
生病可能很不舒服，但是小时候得这样的病
it may be unpleasant. but getting diseases like this when we were young

388
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,234
对我们发育中的免疫系统而言是很重要的
is vital for our developing immune systems

389
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:19,873
我们的身体针对病毒制造有记忆能力的分子
Our bodies create memory molecules against the virus

390
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:20,696
称为“抗体”（Antiboides）
Antibodies

391
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,240
过去，我们依靠来自母亲乳汁的抗体
We used to rely on antibodies from mother's milk

392
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:28,872
现在，我们可以自己做抗体了
Now, we make our own.

393
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,373
当我们年纪大的时候，如果再次得病
If we catch the same disease when we are older

394
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:42,180
抗体让我们能立刻识别出病毒
The antibodies enable our bodies to recognize the virus instantly

395
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,614
白血球将会在病毒复制前
white blood cells wipe it out

396
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,429
消灭病毒
before it has a chance to take order

397
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,116
这就是为什么童年是“接种疫苗”（Vaccination）的最佳时期
This is why childhood is the perfect time for Vaccination.

398
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,183
“疫苗”（Vaccines）是不足以造成伤害的剂量的病毒
Vaccines are harmless doses of viruses

399
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:06,222
比如“流行性腮腺炎”（Mumps）,“脊髓灰质炎”（Polio）和“风疹”（Rubella）
like Mumps, Polio and Rubella

400
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:12,306
身体如同被真的感染过一样，能制造出抗体
The body creates antibodies, as if it had really been infected

401
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:15,583
现在，如果我们真正得病
now, if we ever catch the real thing

402
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:19,390
我们的身体就能识别并攻击病毒
the body will recognize it and attack

403
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,911
在生命的头十年，人体变化大得我们都认不出来
in its first decade, the human body changes beyond recognition.

404
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,255
但现在将出现的是身体最大的变化
but now comes the biggest change of them all

405
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,784
如同过山车一般的“青春期”（Puberty）
the roller coaster ride of puberty

406
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,552
11岁
11 Years

407
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,896
十一岁时，对大多数人来说，青春期已经开始
By age 11, puberty is already under way for most

408
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,844
但这一过程没有具体的时刻表，有些人开始的晚些
but there is no schedule, for some it happens later

409
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:51,531
有些人早些
some earlier

410
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,097
这取决于我们的NDA时钟，
it depends on our DNA clocks

411
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,559
我们的生活方式，甚至我们的饮食
our life styles even our diets

412
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,630
但是不论是10岁还是13岁
whether 10 or 13

413
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,183
男孩还是女孩
female or male

414
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:08,369
青春期都是从我们的脑部开始的
it begins in the brain for all of us

415
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:11,734
在大脑底部，下丘脑（hypothalamus）处
at the base, the hypothalamus

416
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:15,576
跟控制体温相同的区域
the same region that controls our body temperature

417
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:28,528
青春期是在下丘脑释放出一种蛋白质时开始的
puberty starts when the hypothalamus releases a protein

418
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:30,641
这种蛋白质称为 “Kisspeptin”，并将其注入大脑 注：Kisspeptin是一种肽类激素，2001年被发现，暂无译名
Kisspeptin into the brain

419
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,303
Kisspeptin 激活其他急速的释放
the Kisspeptin triggers the release of other hormones

420
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,952
在身体内造成连锁反应
in a chain reaction throughout the body

421
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:53,259
只有这时我们的性器官才开始成熟
only then do our sex organs begin to mature

422
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:01,026
对女孩而言，这意味着“排卵”（Ovulation）
in girls, that means Ovulation

423
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:09,560
现在展示的是女性卵巢的高清晰度图像
this is a high definition view of a woman's ovaries

424
00:41:10,077 --> 00:41:12,244
卵巢是位于中央高亮的灰白色的器官
the off-white organs in the center

425
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:19,674
这组独特的视频来自纽约的 Gold Coast IVF 养育中心
the unique footage from Gold Coast IVF fertility center in New York

426
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,535
展示出在保护疱液中的真实的卵子
shows an actual Egg inside a protective blister of fluid

427
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:30,573
在排卵时，一颗卵从卵巢破茧而出
during Ovulation, an egg burst from the Ovary

428
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:32,997
沿着“输卵管”（fallopian tube）
and travels down the fallopian tube

429
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:34,217
下到“子宫”（Uterus）
to the Uterus

430
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:46,327
从现在一直到“更年期”（Menopause）
from now until Menopause

431
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:49,061
同样的事情每月都会发生
the same thing will happen every month

432
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:55,194
接下来，月经（Menstruation）排出子宫内未受精的卵子
then, Menstruation clears the Uterus of unfertilized eggs

433
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:09,218
卵巢不仅产生卵子，还能产生一组有效的化学物质
the Ovaries not only produce eggs, they also produce a potent cocktail of chemicals

434
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:12,654
他们将激素释放到血液中
they release hormones into the blood stream

435
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:15,019
包括“雌激素”（Estrogen）
including Estrogen

436
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:23,609
这些激素有戏剧性持续情绪和身体的效果
these hormones have dramatic lasting emotional and physical effects

437
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:30,029
使得男孩和女孩出现“速长期”（Growth Spurt）
both boys and girls experience a growth spurt

438
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:50,235
女人和男人的体型开始出现不同
women and men's body shapes diverge

439
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,267
17岁
17 Years

440
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:54,515
女孩变成了女人
girls become women

441
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,984
男孩也变成了男人
boys become men

442
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:15,494
男性的大脑也会释放出 Kisspeptin 来触发青春期
male brains also release Kisspeptin to trigger puberty

443
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,840
大量的新激素涌入睾丸（Testicles)，刺激产生精子
a flood of new hormone stimulates the testicles to produce sperm

444
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:28,804
睾丸还产生了睾酮（Testosterone）的10倍激增
the testicles also generate a 10-fold surge in testosterone

445
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:33,549
睾酮能够促进产生男性生理特征
the hormone that creates the physical characteristics of manhood

446
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:41,224
喉部（Larynx）张开，向前倾斜
the Larynx opens up and tilts forward

447
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:43,625
声带变宽
the vocal cord stretch wider

448
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,524
声带越长，声音震动的音调就越低
the longer chords vibrate at a lower pitch

449
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:50,275
声音就更低沉
the voice deepens

450
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,087
睾酮（睾丸激素）同时也刺激身毛生长
testosterone stimulates the growth body hair

451
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,470
并使肌肉质量倍增
and doubles muscle mass

452
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,354
这包括了增加40%的心脏肌肉
including 40% more heart muscle

453
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:21,067
这些是我们能看到和听到的变化
these are the changes we can see and hear

454
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:24,147
但是变化也在我们看不见的地方进行
but changes are going on that we can't see

455
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:30,244
大脑中，神经细胞正在进行大量的重排
in the brain, nerve cells undergo extensive re-wiring

456
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:33,334
转变我们的情绪和性格
transforming our mood and character

457
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,928
两性都体验到了众多新的情绪
both sex experiences are flood of new emotions

458
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:43,988
但其中之一最为强烈
and one beats them all

459
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,228
第一次
for the first time

460
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:50,196
两性都发现对方的性吸引力
both sexes find the other sexually attractive

461
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:57,293
从内到外，我们的身体都被这新感觉支配
from inside out, our bodies are overwhelmed by new sensations

462
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:00,904
脉搏加快
our pulse raises

463
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:06,864
血压升高
our blood pressure rises

464
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:10,597
嘴唇变得有光泽
our lips gorge

465
00:45:15,163 --> 00:45:17,626
脸颊充血
our cheeks flush with blood

466
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,784
所有这些迹象表明，我们渴望某个人
all signs that we desire someone

467
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:27,093
如果这种渴望变成互相的
and if the desire turns out to be mutual

468
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:33,035
我们又达到了另一个重要的里程碑
we hit another major milestone

469
00:45:34,126 --> 00:45:35,798
初吻
our first kiss

470
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:52,031
在生命的头20年里，人体的一些变化近似奇迹
in its first two decades the human body accomplish something close to miraculous

471
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,114
我们是原来的近4倍高
we are nearly 4 times our original height

472
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,895
21倍重
21 times heavier

473
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:02,824
我们已经消化了九千吨食物
we've digested 9 thousand tons of food

474
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:10,386
心脏跳动了超过十亿次
our hearts have beaten over 1 billion times

475
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:15,893
肺部呼吸超过两亿次
our lungs have drawn over 200 million breathes

476
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:18,967
现在，在青春期之后
now, with puberty behind us

477
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:23,455
我们在身体和精神上已经准备好
we are ready in mind and body

478
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:25,328
成为成年人
to become adults

479
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:32,844
在20岁出头的时候
our early 20s

480
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:35,300
童年和青春期已经在我们身后了
childhood and puberty are behind us

481
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,710
这是我们生命的一个新的阶段
this is the start of a new phase in our lives

482
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,554
成年期
adulthood

483
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:44,020
我们已经飞出鸟巢了。接下来的生活
we flown the nest. what happens now

484
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:45,752
已经完全取决于我们自己
is up to us

485
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,525
21岁
21 Years

486
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:56,860
二十多岁，我们的身体看上去，并且自己也感觉是一生中最好的时光
in our 20s, we look and feel better than that any other time in our lives

487
00:46:58,987 --> 00:47:03,041
我们从内到外都处在全盛时期
we are in our prime both outside and in

488
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,443
万亿细胞组成器官和组织
trillions of cells make up of our organs and tissues

489
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,353
随着时间的推移，这些东西慢慢损坏
over time, these wear-out are get damaged

490
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:16,255
但是新的细胞生长分裂，代替旧的细胞
but new cells grow and divide to replace the old ones

491
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:20,428
身体已经替换了某些整个器官
our body replaces entire organs

492
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,371
所以难怪我们感觉良好
so it's no wonder we feel good

493
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:32,449
本质上说，每隔十年
essentially, every 10 years

494
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,763
我们就全部更新一次身体
we get a brand new body

495
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:40,826
有些组织甚至更新得更快
some tissue regenerate even faster

496
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,075
比如头发和指甲
like our hair and nails

497
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:46,991
这就需要我们常常光顾沙龙这样的地方
which requires a quick treat to the salon every so often

498
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:02,373
头发是死亡的皮肤细胞变成的
hairs are made from modified dead skin cells

499
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:06,521
每一根头发都是从嵌在皮肤中的“毛囊”（Follicle）长出来的
each hair grows from a Follicle embedded in the skin

500
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:12,341
构成头发的细胞在这里生长，由新的细胞向上推后死去
the modified cells grow here. and die as new cells push them upward

501
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:17,229
头发是死亡细胞组成的柱子
the column of dead cells is the hair

502
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:22,038
每个人每年能长出令人难以置信的
each person grows incredible 7 miles of hair

503
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,502
7英里（11公里）长的头发
every year

504
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,875
头发不论我们想不想，都在不停生长
our hair grows whether we wanted to or not

505
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:36,332
但身体的某些部分的生长则可以控制
but other parts of our body are partially under our control

506
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:40,196
现在做出的一些选择
choices we make now, like exercising

507
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:42,992
能影响到我们的余生，比如锻炼。
affected us for the rest of our lives.

508
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:52,153
这能影响我们全身
it has an effect throughout the body

509
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:55,775
帮助细胞和器官保持在巅峰状态
helping cells and organs stay in peak condition

510
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,959
肌肉也在生长
our muscles are also building

511
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:12,347
接下来要展示的是一种新技术，结合了高分辨率CT扫描
this is a new imaging technique that combines the highest resolution ct scans

512
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,034
和先进的电脑技术
with cutting-edge computer power

513
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:17,492
称为 Volumedic(R)
it's called Volumedic(R)

514
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:24,800
它展示了组成我们身体重量三分之一的650块骨骼肌是什么样的
and it shows how our 650 skeleton muscles make up to a third of our adult body weight

515
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:31,454
有人说如果身体所有的肌肉一起工作
it's been suggested that if all the muscles in the body work together

516
00:49:32,257 --> 00:49:39,601
他们能产生足够的力量提起超过11吨的重量，相当于四辆SUV车的重量
they would generate enough power to lift more than 11 tons. the weight of more than four SUVs

517
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:54,296
肌肉是由肌纤维束成
muscles are made from bundles of fibers

518
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:57,614
锻炼撕裂这些纤维
a good work-out rips these fibers apart

519
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:01,848
单细胞通过增加物质来修补损坏
but our cells repair the damage by adding extra material

520
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:06,079
所以肌肉长了回来，变得更大，更强壮
the muscle grows back. bigger and stronger

521
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:09,080
通过我们所做出的选择
through choices we made

522
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:16,269
不幸的是，有些选择是有害的
unfortunately, some choices are less beneficial

523
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,872
有一些损害我们身体无法修复
some exposes to damage that even our xxx cells cannot repair.

524
00:50:45,826 --> 00:50:48,042
派对是20岁的生活的一部分
party is a part of life in our 20s

525
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:56,709
我们都知道吸烟会损害肺部
we all know smoke can damage the lungs

526
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:02,995
但这里，烟雾并不是唯一的危害
but smoke isn't the only hazard here

527
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:07,126
我们的听力也受到
our hearing is under threaten too

528
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,458
巨大噪声的危害
from loud noise

529
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,405
问题出在我们的耳内
the problem is deep inside the ear

530
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:28,921
耳蜗里脆弱的感觉毛发
the fragile sensory hairs in the cochlea

531
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,370
称为“纤毛”（stereocilia）
were stereocilia

532
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,298
他们将声音转换为神经脉冲
turn sound into nerve impulses

533
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:39,190
巨大的噪声将破坏这些不可替代的细胞
loud noise destroys these irreplaceable cells

534
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:47,082
负责高频率声音的纤毛最容易被破坏
the hairs that respond to high frequencies are most effective

535
00:51:47,514 --> 00:51:51,946
也许是因为高音震颤得更为剧烈
maybe because high pitch sound shake their foundations more violently

536
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:56,611
然而这些影响太小了而难以察觉
the effect is too small to notice

537
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:06,643
听力范围却已经在缩小
but the frequency range of our hearing is already shrinking

538
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:18,088
另一个危害的来源是酒精
another source of damage is alcohol

539
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,940
当我们将酒精吸收到血液中时
as we absorb alcohol into our blood stream

540
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:35,096
酒精同时影响我们的神智和器官
it both affects our organs and our state of mind

541
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,728
它使血压升高
it raises our blood pressure

542
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,886
让心脏跳动不规律
and makes our heart beat irregular

543
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:44,689
我们放松，失去抑制力
we relax, lose our inhibitions

544
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:46,853
以及协调能力
and our coordination

545
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,612
这些症状是由于脑中的化学反应
these symptoms are consequence of chemical reactions in the brain

546
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:06,293
特别是在这一区域，小脑（Cerebellum）
especially in this region -- the Cerebellum

547
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:12,193
小脑控制协调能力和平衡
it controls coordination and balance

548
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,075
喝酒时，酒精影响小脑细胞
when we drink, alcohol affects the cerebellum's brain cells

549
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:23,256
脑中部分突触更为频繁的接收信号
some synapses accept the signal more frequently

550
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:28,578
其他的则完全失效
others become totally blocked

551
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:32,902
喝得越多，影响越明显
the more we drink, the more extremely effect

552
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:43,796
现在可能感觉很好
it may feel good now

553
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,374
但接下来就要付出代价
but there will be a price to pay later

554
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:57,840
在派对过后
after a party

555
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:03,344
随着时间的推移，我们逐渐了解我们的极限
time passes, and we get to know our limits

556
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,404
现在，新的挑战出现了
now new challenges are around the arisen

557
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:10,875
寻觅爱情
to find love

558
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:13,189
并且养育后代
and have children of our own

559
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,181
我们近三十岁时
our late 20s

560
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,086
童年已经成为遥远的记忆
childhood is a distant memory

561
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,548
但初吻并不遥远
but not the thriller of our first kiss

562
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:31,409
这是纯粹的欲望
that was pure lust

563
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:34,616
现在到了接受一些新的东西的时候了
now it's time for something new

564
00:54:35,582 --> 00:54:37,965
到了爱上某人的时候了
it's time to fall in love

565
00:54:46,105 --> 00:54:47,832
28岁
28 years

566
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:50,571
我们中的大多数在工作场合遇见另一半
many of us meet our future partners at work

567
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:55,248
你也许认为吸引力是社会或身体的
we may think the attraction is social or physical

568
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:57,937
但其实大部分却是生物的
but a lot of it is biological

569
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:05,873
我们用眼睛来打量对象
we use our eyes to size up our date

570
00:55:11,105 --> 00:55:13,007
但视觉并不是所有
but looks aren't everything

571
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:19,326
吸引力同时也需要嗅觉
attraction is also about smell

572
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,291
鼻腔内部
inside the nose

573
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:26,992
嗅觉（olfactory）神经的作用不仅仅是检测味道
olfactory nerves do more than detect smells

574
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,169
他们还能检测我们闻不到的化学物质
they also detect chemicals we can't smell

575
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:34,236
信息素（pheromones）是一种无味的激素讯息
pheromones, odorless hormonal messages

576
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:36,323
我们在汗液中释放
we release in our sweat

577
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:42,426
信息素承载有关于遗传健康的信息
pheromones carry information about our genetic health

578
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,024
并且能告知我们抵抗疾病的能力
and our ability to resist disease

579
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,652
大脑利用了这些信号
our brains use these signals

580
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:50,174
来帮助我们选择未来的伴侣
to help choose a partner

581
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,937
其必须携带有能给后代最好的基因
with the best possible genes for our children

582
00:55:57,308 --> 00:55:59,395
爱情不仅仅是一种感情
love is more than just emotion

583
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:01,718
它完全就是化学
it's all about chemistry

584
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,896
肾上腺素（adrenalin）进入血液
we release adrenalin into the blood

585
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:15,884
我们的心里已经小鹿乱撞（心跳得厉害）
our heart pounce

586
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:17,402
无法入睡
we can't sleep

587
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,937
（晚上八点见）
meet at 8 pm

588
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:35,836
当这种情况发生时，另一种激素发挥作用
when that happens, another hormone comes into play

589
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:41,182
大脑中充满了“多巴胺”（dopamine）
the brain floods with dopamine

590
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,952
让人感觉良好的激素
the feel good hormone

591
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,862
这种激素跟可卡因一样强大
it's as potent as cocaine

592
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:52,799
让我们感到愉悦，并且上瘾
makes us jovial and it's addictive

593
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:55,626
他让我们希望得到更多
it leaves us wanting more

594
00:57:00,923 --> 00:57:02,881
我们开始考虑承诺
we start thinking about commitment

595
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,532
并最终结婚
and eventually marriage

596
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,814
爱情，既是化学的也是感情的
love, both chemical and emotional

597
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:11,609
在这一天赢得胜利
wins the day

598
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,006
这是一种我们希望持续终身的关系
it's a relationship we hope will last all lifetime

599
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,982
并且是一条长期接合的路
and the paths of long term bonding

600
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:19,906
这是化学的
is chemical

601
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:29,069
性不仅仅是繁衍
sex isn't just about procreation

602
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:29,929
或娱乐
or recreation

603
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:33,281
性从化学的角度加强了我们之间的关系
it chemically strengthens the bond between us

604
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,585
性爱双方的“脑垂体”（pituitary glands）输送
both partner's pituitary glands pump

605
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:38,568
给血液大量称之为“催产素”（Oxytocin）
the blood full of the substance called

606
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,039
的物质
oxytocin

607
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:43,184
有时，这又被称作“结合激素”
sometimes called the bonding hormone

608
00:57:43,908 --> 00:57:48,083
这和我们出生时连结我们和母亲的激素是同一种
it's the very same hormone that binds us to our mothers as new borns

609
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:01,067
一些人类学家相信
some anthropologists believe

610
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,937
催产素是由进化而来的一种让我们结合的手段
oxytocin could be evolution's way of creating a bond

611
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,770
它强大到能够让我们承受为人父母的尝试
that strong enough to endure the trials of parenthood

612
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:29,491
成为父母的时机就是现在
and the time for parenthood is now

613
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,003
男人释放精子
the man releases sperm

614
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:35,408
目标是找到卵子
the goal to find the egg

615
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,491
一颗卵子在女人的卵巢成熟，脱落
an egg ripens and birth from the women's ovary

616
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,740
卵子是人体中最大的细胞
the largest cell in the human body

617
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,669
它经过输卵管（Fallopian tube）
it passes into the Fallopian tube

618
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:47,470
准备好了受孕
ready for fertilization

619
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:57,317
精子是人体最小的细胞
sperm are the smallest cells in the human body

620
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:59,668
在他们面前的是一条艰辛的道路
and they have a tough journey ahead of them

621
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:05,043
首先，他们必须在阴道险恶的环境中生存
first they have to survive the hostile environment of the vagina

622
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:10,295
阴道的分泌物是酸性的，以防止细菌感染
it's secretions are acidic to prevent bacteria infection

623
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,735
并且也会杀死精子
but they also kill sperm

624
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:17,023
射精（ejaculation）能释放出三亿个精子
ejaculation releases 300 million sperm

625
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:21,005
但只有几千个可以到达“子宫颈”（Cervix）
but only thousands will make it as far as the Cervix

626
00:59:45,425 --> 00:59:48,767
幸存的精子游入子宫和输卵管
the surviving sperm swim into the uterus and fallopian tube

627
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,211
输卵管壁肌肉收缩
muscular contractions in the walls of fallopian tube

628
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:58,755
帮助指引精子游向卵子
help guide the sperm toward the egg

629
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:02,375
只有几百个能到这么远
only a few hundred make it this far

630
01:00:04,913 --> 01:00:08,872
而只有一个能让卵子受孕
and only one will succeed in fertilizing the egg

631
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:20,429
这真正是“适者生存”（survival of the fittest）
this truly is survival of the fittest

632
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:27,417
10小时后，三亿精子中最强壮的那一个
10 hours later, the strongest of 300 million sperm

633
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,534
将能够延续他所携带的基因
is the one to pass on its genes

634
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:49,960
到目前为止，人体还没有任何受孕的反应
so far, there is no sign of conception

635
01:00:51,123 --> 01:00:56,243
我们还不知道我们将要开始步入人生的一个新篇章
we are totally unaware that we are about to unbark on a new chapter in our lives

636
01:01:01,034 --> 01:01:02,704
在接下来的40周里
over the next 40 weeks

637
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:06,586
一个单细胞会发育成一个完全成形的
a single cell will develop into a perfectly formed

638
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:08,481
婴儿
baby

639
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:18,003
第一个症状常常是孕吐（妊娠反应）
often the first symptom is morning sickness

640
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:24,870
没有人准确地知道导致呕吐的原因
no one knows for sure what causes the nausea

641
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:30,196
有一种说法是呕吐可以在发育的关键时机
one theory is that it protects the fetus from toxins in food

642
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:31,381
让胎儿避免遭到食物中
which could harm its organs

643
01:01:31,678 --> 01:01:33,814
会损伤婴儿器官的有毒物质的侵害
during this critical phase of development

644
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:42,643
另一中说法是说呕吐是母体免疫系统的一种副作用
another theory is that nausea is a side effect of the mother's immune system

645
01:01:43,445 --> 01:01:47,258
因为母体变得虚弱，就能避免其攻击发育中的胚胎
as it weakens to avoid attacking the developing embryo

646
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,113
实际上胎儿就像是一个寄生虫
the fetus is effectively a parasite

647
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:59,514
在它从母体中吸收所需的的营养，消耗母亲的能量
it saps the mother's energy as it draws what it needs from her body

648
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:03,039
胎儿有它自己的生命维持系统
it has its own life support system

649
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:04,722
胎盘（Placenta）
the placenta

650
01:02:06,565 --> 01:02:11,803
在这里，母亲的血液会流经一个薄膜然后把营养物带进胎儿的血液中
here, the mother's blood passes nutrients across a membrane into the fetal blood

651
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:30,476
随着食物的不断供应
with its constant supply of nourishment

652
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:34,315
在第一个十周内，胎儿能发育到超过30盎司（850克）
the fetus grows over 30 ounces in its first 10 weeks

653
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:39,611
子宫要增大到原来大小的一千倍
the uterus expends to 1000 times its normal size

654
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:41,288
仅仅只是为了支撑胎儿
just to hold it

655
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,658
那么额外的空间肯定是来至一些地方
that extra space has to come from somewhere

656
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:58,246
所以母体会在内部做重新的调整
so the mother's body rearranges itself internally

657
01:03:02,635 --> 01:03:04,496
这个女人没有怀孕
this woman isn't pregnant

658
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:07,534
但是她的器官仍然很密集
but her organs are still a tight fit

659
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:10,978
在怀孕女人的体内
in a pregnant woman

660
01:03:11,115 --> 01:03:13,017
器官会被挤压
the organs get squeezed

661
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:15,492
有的会被推挤到胸部
and some are pushed up into her chest

662
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:25,748
不仅器官会被挤压
not only are the organs squashed

663
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,965
而且他们还要为两个人工作
now they are working for two

664
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:31,151
肺和心脏会工作地比以前更幸苦
the lungs and the heart work harder than ever before

665
01:03:32,754 --> 01:03:36,715
为了争取空间，脊柱的肌肉和肌腱（tendon）
to make space, muscles and tendons in the spin relax

666
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,393
并且弯曲变形
and it curves out of its normal shape

667
01:03:47,192 --> 01:03:49,116
胃也会被挤压
the stomach is also compressed

668
01:03:49,361 --> 01:03:51,942
同时被旋转成45度
and rotated through 45 degrees

669
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:56,485
它只能承受住少量的食物和水
it can only hold small amounts of food and drink

670
01:03:56,602 --> 01:03:59,495
但是逐渐长大的婴儿却需要更多食物
and still the growing baby demands more

671
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:14,964
9个月以后就进入了分娩的时期
after 9 months, its time to give birth

672
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,766
而生出一个7磅（3公斤）的婴儿是相当具有挑战性的
and pushing out a 7 pound baby can be quite a challenge

673
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,930
变软的肌腱会让骨盆（Pelvis）打开产道（birth canal）
soften tendons allow the pelvis to open up the birth canal

674
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,123
但尽管如此，空间仍然很拥挤
but even so, it's a crowd space

675
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,742
Volumedic 图像技术展示了婴儿出生时要经过的路线
volumedic imagine shows the claustrophobic route the baby has to take

676
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,867
有一些卷曲的到达尾骨
with a tight twist to get around the tail bone

677
01:04:50,837 --> 01:04:54,250
有时对于母婴而言产道太紧了
sometimes it's too tight of a squeeze for mother and baby

678
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:59,959
这时，唯一安全生产的方式就是手术
the only option for a safe delivery is surgery

679
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,477
剖腹产（Caesarean section）
a Caesarean section

680
01:05:21,819 --> 01:05:25,497
从一个新生儿，到成为父母的30年里
from a new born baby to becoming a parent in 30 years

681
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:28,762
生命之圈还在继续
the circle of life goes on

682
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:40,482
20岁已经离我们远去，身体将要开始一个新的变化时期
our 20s are behind us. our bodies are about to enter a new period of change

683
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:42,904
这就是衰老
as the aging process

684
01:05:42,998 --> 01:05:43,988
的开始
takes on

685
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:56,527
有些专家认为，我们自出生起就开始了衰老
some experts believe that we all start aging from the moment we are born

686
01:05:57,076 --> 01:05:59,330
身体的修复系统补偿了这一过程
the body's repair systems compensate

687
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:04,048
但现在，修复系统本身开始老化
but now, the repair systems themselves are aging

688
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:10,036
我们外表的变化越来越明显
the changes in our appearances are getting noticeable

689
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,456
我们进入了40岁
we are in our 40s

690
01:06:23,802 --> 01:06:24,825
45岁
45 Years

691
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:27,102
年龄和阳光日积月累的影响下
the accumulative effect of years and the sun

692
01:06:27,091 --> 01:06:28,590
出现了第一个症状（Symptom）
causes the first symptom

693
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:31,221
皱纹（wrinkles）
wrinkles

694
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:37,598
从出生开始，我们的皮肤细胞就已以惊人的速度补充我们的皮肤细胞
since birth, our skin cells have replenished our skin at an astonishing rate

695
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:42,721
我们每分钟最多可以生成三万个新的皮肤细胞
we can make up to 30 thousand new skin cells every minute

696
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:47,029
以替代不断脱落的死亡细胞
to replace the dead cells where constantly shedding

697
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:06,554
45岁时，我们累积已经制造了超过400磅（180公斤）的皮肤碎屑
by 45, we've created more than 400 pounds of dust from old skin cells

698
01:07:08,363 --> 01:07:13,089
不论我们几岁，皮肤细胞都不会超过几个月的年龄
whatever our age, our skin cells are never more than a few months old

699
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:25,083
皮肤细胞没有什么问题
the skin cells are fine

700
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:28,208
问题出在将皮肤细胞结合在一起的东西
the problem is the stuff that binds them together

701
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:29,736
胶原蛋白（collagen）
collagen

702
01:07:32,229 --> 01:07:34,877
来自太阳的紫外线光辐射
ultraviolet radiation in sun light

703
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,368
引发了分子间的链式反应
triggers a molecular chain reaction

704
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:39,060
这种反应能降解胶原蛋白
that degrades collagen

705
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:46,405
使得纤维越来越薄，断裂
the fibers get thin and break

706
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,901
皮肤失去弹性
our skin loses elasticity

707
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:55,280
于是产生皱纹
and we get wrinkles

708
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:06,730
视力也在改变
our eye sight is also changing

709
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:11,488
几年前，我们不带眼镜仍能轻易的阅读
a few years ago we can easily read without glasses

710
01:08:18,156 --> 01:08:20,875
现在，晶状体（lens）出问题了
the problem is in the lens

711
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:26,409
晶状体内的细胞，心脏细胞以及大部分的脑细胞
inner lens cells, along with heart cells and most brain cells

712
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:30,112
是身体唯一从不替换的的细胞
are among the only cells our bodies never replace

713
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:34,745
晶状体跟我们出生时的晶状体完全一样
they are exactly the same lens cells as we had as babies

714
01:08:35,726 --> 01:08:39,041
当我们变老时，晶状体逐渐变硬
as we get older, the lens is gradually stiffen

715
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:41,821
他们不能很好的对焦了
they don't focus as well

716
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:47,224
眼睛也开始变的干燥
and our eyes start to dry out

717
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:52,432
用来润滑眼睛的液体越来越少
we produce less fluid to lubricate the eye

718
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,219
越来越少的眼泪来冲走残骸
and fewer tears to flush out debris

719
01:09:06,398 --> 01:09:09,788
中年的我们，体型也在发生改变
middle age also changes the shape of our bodies

720
01:09:11,341 --> 01:09:15,098
运动本身已经无法再让我们保持体型了
exercise alone isn't enough to keep us in shape anymore

721
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:18,645
20岁时，保持体型很容易
at 20, it was easy

722
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:22,713
我们吃多少都没关系，做什么也都没关系
we can eat what we wanted, do what we wanted

723
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:27,243
但现在，新陈代谢（metabolism）发生了改变，变得更容易变胖
now our metabolism is changed, and it's easier to put on weight

724
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:43,567
原因在血液
the explanation is in our blood

725
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:48,583
中年时，多种激素水平下降
in middle age, the level of several hormone start to drop

726
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:52,934
雌激素（estrogen），睾酮（testosterone）和生长激素（growth hormones）
estrogen, testosterone and growth hormones

727
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:55,820
我们开始失去四肢的肌肉
and we start to lose limb muscle

728
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:04,380
成年期的我们每十年减少大约6.5磅（3公斤）的肌肉
we lose about 6.5 pounds of muscle during each decade of our adult lives

729
01:10:15,053 --> 01:10:18,307
肌肉越少，身体消耗的热量就越少
less muscle means the body burns fewer calories

730
01:10:19,784 --> 01:10:21,494
于是我们不需要那么多的燃料了
we need less fuel

731
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,909
如果我们还像以前那样吃下去的话
if we continue to eat like we used to

732
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:41,109
过剩的食物就会转换成这样
the surplus food gets converted into this

733
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,446
脂肪
fat

734
01:10:55,428 --> 01:10:58,835
对女人而言，脂肪往往聚集在臀部
for women, fat tends to go to their hips

735
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:04,779
这是身体的一种怀孕时供应稳定能量的方式
it's the body's way of providing a steady energy supply for pregnancy

736
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,171
而男人将脂肪累积在不同的地方
man store fat in a different area

737
01:11:09,924 --> 01:11:10,994
腰部
their bellies

738
01:11:12,403 --> 01:11:15,547
腰部脂肪进化成能快速释放能量
belly fat evolve for quick energy release

739
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:19,728
这帮助我们的男性祖先能在狩猎旅行中生存下来
it help sustain our male ancestors during hunting trips

740
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:29,119
然而脂肪代谢的能力随着年龄而减慢
our ability to metabolize fat slows down as we age

741
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:42,883
在体内的每个细胞中，都存在着一种微结构称为“线粒体”（Mitochondria）
inside each cell in our bodies, there are tiny structures called Mitochondria

742
01:11:49,635 --> 01:11:52,340
这些线粒体是我们身体的发电厂
these are the bodies' power plants

743
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:57,561
他们将食物里的营养物质
they combine nutrients from food

744
01:11:57,775 --> 01:11:59,701
和肺部来的氧气结合
with oxygen from the lungs

745
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,042
以释放能量
to release energy

746
01:12:05,309 --> 01:12:06,388
当我们逐渐老去
as we get older

747
01:12:06,538 --> 01:12:08,594
线粒体的数量逐渐变少
the number of mitochondria dwindles

748
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:12,678
我们越来越不能有效地代谢脂肪
and we lose the ability to metabolize fat as efficiently

749
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:19,174
过多的热量摄入加上代谢率的降低
too many calories and the drop in metabolic rate

750
01:12:19,345 --> 01:12:21,406
构成了致命的组合
can be a lethal combination

751
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:26,013
脂肪远远不只是我们腰部的赘肉
fat is much more than an extra insure on our waist line xxx

752
01:12:26,954 --> 01:12:29,657
它还是整个身体的粮食
it's bread throughout the entire body

753
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:38,541
首次
for the first time

754
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:39,656
借由高清晰度内窥镜
a high-definition endoscope

755
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,027
从肚脐插入
inserted through the navel

756
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,642
在腹部
reveals the folic ***(stent) of fat cover

757
01:12:44,738 --> 01:12:46,351
揭示了脂肪的覆盖
inside the abdomen

758
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,454
肠道被黄色的脂肪沉积包裹
the intestines are smothered in yellow fat deposits

759
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:57,239
脂肪能进入我们体内几乎任何可用的空间
fat finds its way into almost every available space of our bodies

760
01:12:58,298 --> 01:13:00,746
甚至进入到血管内
even inside of our blood vessels

761
01:13:04,582 --> 01:13:07,236
沉积在血管内壁
deposits build up on the inner walls

762
01:13:07,271 --> 01:13:08,812
缩小了血管
narrowing the tube

763
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:12,829
心脏就必须加倍努力输送血液
the heart has to work harder to pump blood

764
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:14,533
以通过狭窄的血管
through the restricted vessels

765
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,887
在某些极端情况下
in extreme cases

766
01:13:21,237 --> 01:13:23,499
脂肪甚至可以彻底阻塞血管
fat can block the vessels completely

767
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:28,317
如果脂肪阻塞了给心脏供氧的动脉
if fat blocks the arteries that supply the heart

768
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:30,440
结果将是致命的
the result can be fatal

769
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:36,910
心肌被剥夺了氧气和养分
the heart muscles are deprived of oxygen and nutrients

770
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,722
有痉挛的危险
the muscle risks going into spasm

771
01:13:41,599 --> 01:13:42,669
导致心脏病发作
a heart attack

772
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,981
心脏病是西方世界最大的杀手
heart disease is the biggest killer in the western world

773
01:13:58,061 --> 01:14:01,555
脂肪并不是我们衰老时的唯一危险
fat isn't the only risk to our health as we age

774
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:05,901
压力也起着破坏性的作用
stress also plays a damaging role

775
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:08,128
中年生活充满压力
middle age life is stressful

776
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:11,952
稳住工作并且抚养青少年的子女
holding down the job and raising teenage kids

777
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:14,537
压力让人精疲力尽
stress is exhausting

778
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,104
但破坏却不停止
but the damage doesn't stop there

779
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:20,847
甚至加快了衰老
it also speeds up the aging process

780
01:14:31,063 --> 01:14:32,774
50岁
50 years old

781
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:35,341
我们的身体可能变慢了
our bodies maybe slowing down

782
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,188
但我们的生活节奏却没有
but our life styles aren't

783
01:14:38,232 --> 01:14:40,735
日趋庞大的家庭，以及艰巨的事业
a growing family and a demanding career

784
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:44,304
这些加起来成为另一个影响衰老过程的因素
add up to another influence on the aging process

785
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,408
这就是压力
stress

786
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,250
50岁
50 years

787
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:51,320
我们都认得压力的外在表现
we all recognize the outward signs of stress

788
01:14:52,132 --> 01:14:54,388
手心出汗，呼吸急促
sweaty palms, shortness of breath

789
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,115
晕眩的感觉
a dizzy feeling

790
01:14:56,963 --> 01:15:00,641
然而真正的损害发生在身体内部
but the real damage takes place inside

791
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:13,682
我们的身体本能的转变到“战或逃”的状态
our bodies instinctively shift into fight or flight mode

792
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:18,129
激素，肾上腺素和皮质醇从肾上腺涌出
hormones, adrenalin and cortisol flood from the adrenal gland

793
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:19,740
进入血液
into our blood stream

794
01:15:20,664 --> 01:15:22,333
这时我们的肌肉收缩
our muscles contract

795
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,730
动脉紧缩
arteries constrict

796
01:15:24,582 --> 01:15:26,004
心跳变得更快
the heart pumps faster

797
01:15:26,577 --> 01:15:29,039
血压达到极限
and our blood pressure hits the roof

798
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,727
我们演化出“战或逃”的反射
we evolve the fight or flight reflex

799
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:47,936
以快速响应捕食者的袭击
to quickly respond to attacks from predators

800
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:53,171
但太经常出发这种反射
to have the reflex triggering so constantly

801
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:57,707
会对我们的心血管网造成不可挽回的伤害
causes irreparable harm to our cardial vascular network

802
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:18,873
压力加速血管的老化
stress accelerates the aging of our blood vessels

803
01:16:19,468 --> 01:16:22,915
高血压损害动脉壁的细胞
high blood pressure damages cell in the artery walls

804
01:16:23,658 --> 01:16:25,704
使其变得坚硬并且变厚
they become stiff and thick

805
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,817
特别是在人体最大的动脉
especially here in the biggest artery

806
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:31,497
主动脉（aorta）
the aorta

807
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,317
动脉壁僵硬限制了血液流速
arteries with stiff walls restrict blood flow

808
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:40,500
使血压升高
as our blood pressure raises

809
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:43,159
心脏不得不更加努力的工作
the heart is forced to work harder

810
01:16:59,363 --> 01:17:02,498
这是一个恶性循环。我们得到的压力越多
it's a vicious cycle. the more stress we get,

811
01:17:02,636 --> 01:17:05,178
对血管的破坏就越大
the more we damage our blood vessels

812
01:17:05,691 --> 01:17:07,787
而对血管的破坏越大
and the more we damage our blood vessels,

813
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:12,216
我们就越难对付压力
the less we are able to deal with the effects of stress

814
01:17:20,763 --> 01:17:22,770
如果问题超出我们的控制
if the problem gets out of control

815
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,984
心脏就会增大
the heart becomes enlarged

816
01:17:24,856 --> 01:17:27,567
以应对输送血液通过狭窄
as it struggles to force blood through our narrow

817
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:29,987
缺少弹性的血管的情况
less elastic blood vessels

818
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:45,415
高血压最终能让大脑中的血管破裂
high blood pressure can even rupture blood vessels in the brain

819
01:17:45,813 --> 01:17:49,844
造成中风（Stroke）
a stroke

820
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,837
但我们中的大多数都知道如何控制压力
most of us learned to manage stress

821
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:58,391
但对于50岁的女人
but for women in their 50s

822
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:01,224
另一个因素加重了问题
another factor compounds the problem

823
01:18:01,362 --> 01:18:02,376
停经（Menopause）
Menopause

824
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:13,072
50岁时，女性的卵巢停止释放卵子
in their 50s, a woman's ovary stop releasing eggs

825
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:16,669
同时也停止产生性激素
they also stop producing sex hormones

826
01:18:16,849 --> 01:18:19,271
包括“雌激素”（estrogen）和“孕酮”（progesterone）
estrogen and progesterone

827
01:18:19,288 --> 01:18:22,743
这标志着女性生育生活的结束
which signals the end of a woman's reproductive live

828
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:35,228
随着激素供应的下降
as the supply of hormones xxx down

829
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:39,509
大脑负责处理情绪，睡眠和温度控制的区域
it destabilizes the regions of the brain that deal with mood

830
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:41,936
开始变得不稳定
sleep and temperature control

831
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:48,380
当下丘脑偏离航线
when the hypothalamus is thrown off course

832
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:50,285
潮热就发生了
hot flash is occurred

833
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:54,137
这时，身体不能将体温控制到正确的位置
moments when the body can't set its thermostat correctly

834
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,957
骨骼和肌肉组织变弱
bone and muscle tissues weaken

835
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:10,057
女人的身体一辈子都在适应这些激素
the woman's body has spend its whole life getting accustom to these hormone

836
01:19:10,557 --> 01:19:11,442
但现在他们突然不见了
now they are gone

837
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:14,437
老龄化进程加快了
and the aging process accelerates

838
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,725
我们的六十岁来了又走
our 60s come and go

839
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:29,882
我们的孩子离开家
our kids leave home

840
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:31,636
我们也离开了工作岗位
and we leave work

841
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,974
从此进入了生活的一个新的阶段
we enter a new phase of life

842
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,304
老年
old age

843
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:42,549
在70年里
in 70 years

844
01:19:42,624 --> 01:19:44,437
我们从一个小宝宝
we've grown from a tiny baby

845
01:19:44,902 --> 01:19:45,876
长成成年人
to an adult

846
01:19:46,933 --> 01:19:48,955
从孩子到父母
from child to parent

847
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,828
再到祖父母
to grandparent

848
01:19:51,718 --> 01:19:54,733
老龄化进程始于几十年前
the aging process began several decades ago

849
01:19:56,069 --> 01:19:59,582
现在我们已经到了老年期
now we are in the grip of old age

850
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:03,276
这是生命旅程的最后一章
it's the final chapter in the journey of life

851
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:12,789
退休以后，我们的生活方式日趋缓慢
when we retire from work, we gain a slower life style

852
01:20:12,952 --> 01:20:14,527
我们的身体也慢了下来
and our body slow down

853
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:18,356
外表的老化只是开始
the outwards signs of aging are only the beginning

854
01:20:35,772 --> 01:20:39,210
衰老同时也极大的影响我们的骨骼
aging also dramatically affects our skeletons

855
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:43,473
我们中的任何人都有可能患上“骨质疏松症”（osteoporosis）
any of us could be at risk for osteoporosis

856
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,892
我们的骨细胞仍在辛勤工作
our bone cells are still hard work

857
01:20:58,002 --> 01:21:01,015
破坏旧的骨骼，换上新的
destroying old bone. and replacing it with new

858
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:05,737
然而，年老的我们这一平衡已被打乱
but old age upsets this balance

859
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:13,906
“破骨细胞”（osteoclast）过快的破坏骨头 以至于“造骨细胞”（osteoblast）来不及重建
osteoclast destroy the bone faster than osteoblast can rebuild it

860
01:21:18,996 --> 01:21:23,426
留下的就只剩空心而脆的骨纤维簇
what remains is a hollowed out cluster of brittle bone fibers

861
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:29,201
我们的骨头慢慢的变碎
our bone slowly crumble

862
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:31,268
随着时间的推移
as the year slide by

863
01:21:41,572 --> 01:21:44,810
骨折的危险变得极为现实
broken bones become a very real danger

864
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:49,173
男人和女人都有可能发生
it can happen to men and women alike

865
01:21:54,686 --> 01:21:56,544
然而在女人身上，这个过程比男人要快
but the process is faster in women

866
01:21:56,762 --> 01:21:59,664
这是由于停经造成的激素变化
because of the hormonal changes of menopause

867
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,816
衰老的过程是最伟大的生命之谜之一
the aging process is one of the great mysteries of life

868
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:12,049
为什么我们的外貌变化如此之大
why does our appearance change so much

869
01:22:12,274 --> 01:22:15,282
在40到70岁之间
between the ages of 40 and 70

870
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,563
这已远超过磨损
it's more than wear and tear

871
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:26,865
这是一个影响身体里每个细胞的过程
it's a process affecting every cell in our bodies

872
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:31,571
每天，细胞克隆数十亿个
every day, cells clone themselves into billions

873
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:33,963
来应对身体器官的磨损
to battle wear and tear on our organs

874
01:22:35,852 --> 01:22:38,962
每个细胞内的DNA都被复制了
the DNA inside each cell gets copied

875
01:22:40,964 --> 01:22:42,793
老的细胞死去
the old cells die off

876
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:44,721
新的细胞替代了他们的位置
and the new ones take their place

877
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:48,835
然而这个复制系统并不是完美的
but the copying system isn't perfect

878
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:51,058
DNA中的任何缺陷
any imperfections in our DNA

879
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:53,727
都被复制了下来
are also duplicated

880
01:23:15,693 --> 01:23:19,444
在我们的一生中，我们复制了多个自我
over our lifetime, we make so many copies of ourselves

881
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:22,657
使得最细小的缺陷也被累积
that even the tiniest defects accumulate

882
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:26,611
这就像复印机
it's like using a photo copier

883
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,992
从复印件复印来的复印件质量就会下降
copies made from copies degrade in quality

884
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:41,040
从出生起，每隔十年，我们就完全替换一次脸部的骨骼
we have totally replaced the bone in our face every 10 years since we were born

885
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:46,258
我们70岁的脸已经是第七代副本
our 70-year-old face is a 7 generation copy

886
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,782
从婴孩时期的脸复制而来
of our baby face

887
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:58,335
缺陷在每一次复制都被扩大
the imperfections are exaggerated with each copy

888
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:14,069
另一个原因，可能是因为我们所呼吸的空气
another reason for aging could be the air that we breath

889
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,147
我们需要氧气来存活
we need oxygen to live

890
01:24:17,796 --> 01:24:19,297
但在一生中
but throughout our lives

891
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:21,971
氧气却缓慢的毒害我们
it's slowly poisons us

892
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:43,912
在每个细胞内
inside each of our cells

893
01:24:44,072 --> 01:24:47,071
“线粒体”（mitochondria）就像微小的发电厂
our mitochondria are like tiny power plants

894
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:49,388
将食物与氧气结合
combining food with oxygen

895
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,835
线粒体制造出我们需要的能量
they create the energy we need

896
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:57,573
但就如发电厂，他们也产生污染
but just like a power plant, they also generate pollution

897
01:24:59,288 --> 01:25:02,462
在这里，这种污染就是氧气
in this case, the pollutant is oxygen

898
01:25:03,468 --> 01:25:09,273
线粒体将分子变成不稳定的形式，称为“自由基”（free radical）
the mitochondria change molecules into unstable forms called free radical

899
01:25:15,196 --> 01:25:20,059
一生中，自由基缓慢的使线粒体窒息
over our life time, free radical slowly suffocate the mitochondria

900
01:25:20,402 --> 01:25:21,792
并破坏细胞
and damage our cells

901
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:28,136
我们的细胞和DNA被损坏的越来越厉害
our cells and DNA become more and more damaged

902
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:32,034
以至于修复系统失效
repair systems fail

903
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,184
缺陷被累积
imperfections accumulate

904
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:43,320
最终，器官失效
eventually, our organs fail

905
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:01,791
哪怕你的生活方式很健康
even with a healthy life style

906
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,565
并且有良好的药物治疗
and the best medicine

907
01:26:03,879 --> 01:26:05,814
死亡也是不可避免的
death is unavoidable

908
01:26:07,965 --> 01:26:10,132
DNA决定了我们是谁
our DNA makes us what we are

909
01:26:10,284 --> 01:26:11,698
并指引我们发育
and guides our development

910
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,438
然而它也决定了我们能活多久
but it also determines how long we live

911
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,864
每一次细胞复制自己的时候
every time one of our cells copies itself

912
01:26:29,964 --> 01:26:33,569
就丢失其DNA尾端很小的一块
it loses a tiny piece from the end of the DNA

913
01:26:34,396 --> 01:26:36,625
经过数十亿次的分裂
after billions of self divisions

914
01:26:36,977 --> 01:26:39,414
整个尾端都消失了
the end section is gone

915
01:26:40,227 --> 01:26:42,385
这时细胞不能再次分裂
our cells can't divide anymore

916
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:57,364
死亡，如同生活，也是一个生物过程
death, like life, is a biological process

917
01:27:05,369 --> 01:27:08,190
科学家认为，接近死亡的时刻
scientist believe that near the moment of death

918
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:11,386
我们的血液中弥漫着内啡肽（Endorphin）
our blood stream is flooded with endorphins

919
01:27:11,621 --> 01:27:13,691
如同之前说过，内啡肽是自然的止痛药
the bodys natural pain killers

920
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:18,982
现在，由于缺氧
now, starved of oxygen

921
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:20,880
身体组织无法运作
tissues can't function

922
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:29,643
在十秒内，大脑的电活动骤降
within 10 seconds, the brain's electrical activity drops

923
01:27:39,248 --> 01:27:42,446
听觉是最后一个消失的感官
hearing is the last sense to go

924
01:27:47,716 --> 01:27:52,163
可能需要一天，皮肤细胞才会停止分裂
it can take 24 hours for our skin cells to stop dividing

925
01:27:54,559 --> 01:27:56,331
最后的电脉冲
its final impulse

926
01:28:08,213 --> 01:28:10,964
有一种说法是，生命还会继续
there's a saying that life goes on

927
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:17,152
但对我们中的一些人来说，生命的确能继续一段时间
for some of us, it could go on for some time

928
01:28:18,517 --> 01:28:20,091
感谢现代医药的帮助
thanks to modern medicine

929
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:22,588
现今在美国出生的孩子
children born in the US today

930
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:26,418
将有可能活到庆祝他们77岁生日的时候
can expect to live to celebrate their 77th birthday

931
01:28:26,599 --> 01:28:27,814
甚至更久
and beyond

932
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:34,009
甚至当我们过世后，我们的生活也能通过亲人
even when we are gone, we live on through loved ones

933
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:40,590
我们的孩子和他们的孩子，他们的每一个细胞都带有我们的基因
our children, and their children carry our genes in every cell

934
01:28:41,471 --> 01:28:43,773
他们带有我们的记忆
they carry memories of us too

935
01:28:44,038 --> 01:28:48,396
这些记忆就是他们与我们共享的，我们生命非凡的故事的一幕又一幕
the moments they've shared from our extraordinary story

936
01:28:49,078 --> 01:28:51,507
所有的旅行都有尽头，天下没有不散的筵席
all journeys must come to an end

937
01:28:54,624 --> 01:28:58,352
但回头看看，这是怎样的一个旅程啊！
but what a journey it's been

938
01:29:10,984 --> 01:29:26,992
