YYeTs.com

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,130
I've never seen him this happy before.

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,190
That's because you've never seen him

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,820
on "Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,220
Look!

10
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,910
A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,010
I can't wait until I get a rash.

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,590
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,760
I guess they really do read their mail.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,400
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,770
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,230
Look at him, just standing in line

17
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,540
like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,320
Let's go say hello.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,370
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,990
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,640
He thinks there's a difference.

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,830
Arthur?

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,620
Arthur, it's me--

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,880
Sheldon Cooper.

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,420
You may not remember because of your advanced age.

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,080
Trust me, I... I remember.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,280
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,960
Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,690
His science show inspired millions of children.

30
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,740
Ho-hold on.

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,650
You... You have a girlfriend?

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, and I've heard so much about you.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,720
Hey look-- we're wearing the same orthopedic shoes.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,850
O-Okay, I get it now.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,570
Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.

37
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,910
Oh, oh, right, I remember your-your girlfriend.

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,560
Is-Is she... is she here?

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,240
No, she's not.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,290
So, what prescription are you getting filled?

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,090
- Sheldon. - Wait, I want to guess.

42
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,550
Don't tell me.

43
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,350
I wasn't going to tell you.

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,810
Sheldon, come on.

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,030
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,970
All right, give me a hint.

47
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,940
Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,930
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.

49
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,620
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,370
buying homeopathic medicine-- you love that.

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,970
But I'm hanging out with my friend,

52
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,220
and we're having fun.

53
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,830
Look how happy he is.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,390
Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place.

55
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,750
You want to do something?

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,300
- Actually, I'm busy. - Doing what?

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,720
There's a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave...

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,230
- You're going to girls' night. - Yeah.

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,140
You know they're making jewelry, right?

60
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,510
You think they came up with that?

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,630
They were going to drink beer and play darts.

62
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,620
What's up?

63
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,070
Not his testosterone levels.

64
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,020
Excuse me.

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,120
I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,480
How is that possible?

67
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,810
Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.

68
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,320
Goody! What's it say?

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,140
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes,

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,620
and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,550
That's strange.

72
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,250
That he would come to you for that and not me.

73
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,900
Oh, I got two emails from him.

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,720
"Do you have Leonard's email address?"

75
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,610
And...

76
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,300
"Never mind, I found it."

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,190
I can't believe he picked you over me.

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,500
You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,860
who hasn't done any real science in decades.

80
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

81
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,350
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

82
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,920
It's true, you'd rust.

83
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,620
And to think I idolized that man.

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,980
And why?

85
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,050
At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony.

86
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,320
Is it really worth getting upset about?

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,210
They say don't meet your heroes.

88
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity,

89
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
because if you do, you'll see them as they really are--

90
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,370
degenerate carnival folk.

91
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,330
Come on, he's a retired kids show host.

92
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,500
That's even worse.

93
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,710
Using the sweet candy of science

94
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,830
to trick children into loving him.

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,440
Pervert.

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,270
Have you ever thought about

97
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,000
why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?

98
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,410
Yes, I have.

99
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,740
And my only conclusion

100
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,610
is the prescription he was picking up the other day

101
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,470
was for cuckoo pills.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,020
Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.

103
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,360
That's kind of a stretch.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,010
Look, when it comes to social skills,

105
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,460
I've mastered the big three.

106
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,590
There's the coy smile.

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,350
There's the friendly chuckle.

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,550
There's the vocalization of sympathy.

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,290
That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.

110
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,980
From what I saw the other day,

111
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,620
I could understand why he and...

112
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,800
some people might find you...

113
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,980
What?

114
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,040
Doesn't matter.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,130
No, go ahead, say it.

116
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,630
I know what it is.

117
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,070
I've heard it my whole life.

118
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,260
The word's "annoying".

119
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,570
Go ahead, say it.

120
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,560
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
Sheldon...

122
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,900
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

123
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,730
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

124
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm annoying. I'm annoying.

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh...

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,430
Now where are you going?

127
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,900
Look, you know you want to say it-- say it.

128
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,390
Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

129
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,090
Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

130
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,050
Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.

131
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,390
This is fun.

132
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry

133
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,220
that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,700
Penny, how's it going over there?

135
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,660
Good-- I'm just having little trouble with the glue.

136
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,030
How do you not know how to use glue?

137
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,130
Did you ditch pre-school?

138
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,790
Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.

139
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,600
Hello, everyone.

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,990
Okay, let me have it.

141
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,960
Let's hear all the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

142
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,620
Nope.

143
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,310
Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

144
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
So I won't be making fun of you,

146
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,670
or the things you like,

147
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
or the fact that you just want to have fun.

148
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,440
Howie, stop.

149
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,290
Come on, look at what I'm making.

150
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm making a bracelet.

152
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,860
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

153
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,640
You know, instead of beads and glue,

154
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
you guys can use my soldering iron.

155
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.

156
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,410
Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.

157
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,120
- Actually, I'd kind of like to try that. - Me, too.

158
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,970
Be right back.

159
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,240
When did I have pistachios?

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,670
Arthur.

161
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,380
Arthur.

162
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,400
Arthur.

163
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,410
Door knocker.

164
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,630
That's TV money.

165
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,430
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

166
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,150
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

167
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,790
Of course you woke me, it's 7:30.

168
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,550
Well, I would have been here sooner,

169
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,010
but for some reason your home

170
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,210
isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

171
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,590
What do you want, Sheldon?

172
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,610
It's been pointed out by my girlfriend

173
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,140
that I may have been annoying to you.

174
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,600
She sounds like a keeper.

175
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,300
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

176
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,770
I am truly sorry.

177
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,970
All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.

178
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,750
No, no, now that... we've cleared the air,

179
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,440
I wanted to discuss another matter with you.

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,140
Sheldon, in a couple hours, I have to get up,

181
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,470
pee and then wander around the house.

182
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,060
Well, then, I'll make this quick.

183
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,640
Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard.

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,510
Now, I know he said it's promising

185
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,400
and he's going to collaborate on it,

186
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,730
but now that you and I are friends again,

187
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,360
I am at your disposal.

188
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,380
Frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help,

189
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,850
because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been.

190
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,290
Or dead.

191
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,610
I should be so lucky.

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,350
So, uh, what do you say?

193
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,780
You know, if it's all the same with you,

194
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,930
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

195
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,060
It's because I'm annoying, right?

196
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,000
I know it is. Say it.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

198
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,130
- Good night. - Say it.

199
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,170
Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying.

200
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,950
Say it. Say it.

201
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm annoying. Say it.

202
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
You're annoying!

203
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,150
Wow, that really hurt.

204
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,340
If you would have told me when I was a kid

205
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,880
that someday I would be doing science

206
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,380
next to Professor Proton,

207
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,500
I would not have believed you.

208
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,540
If someone had told me

209
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,040
that people would still call me Professor Proton

210
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
when I was 83 years old,

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,180
I never would have quit smoking.

212
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,370
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited.

213
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,360
This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is really interesting.

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
Hello, Leonard.

215
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,160
Oh, hello, Arthur.

216
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,810
What an odd coincidence that you're both here.

217
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,240
Why is it odd?

218
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,030
Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day

219
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,160
with a beloved children's television science personality.

220
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,590
Isn't that right, new friend and colleague,

221
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,840
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

222
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,160
Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.

223
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,910
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

224
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,280
It's an honor to meet you.

225
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,620
My show never would have happened without yours.

226
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
That's what I told my lawyers.

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,470
Mr. Nye, hello.

228
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,330
I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.

229
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,630
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

230
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,470
No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson.

231
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,720
Now let's go.

232
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,510
What are you guys working on?

233
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,730
Oh, uh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

234
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,490
That's interesting.

235
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,930
Haven't you stolen enough from me?

236
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,950
Back off, bow tie!

237
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,240
Hey, guys...

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,020
What do you think?

239
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,990
Wow, Penny, good job.

240
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,990
Thanks. Target, $4.99.

241
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm getting a drink.

242
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,710
What are you working on?

243
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,540
Oh, I'm making a necklace for my mom.

244
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,520
That's sweet.

245
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,810
Yeah, she and my dad are going through

246
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,170
a bit of a rough patch, so

247
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,290
I wanted to do something to let her know

248
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,580
I was thinking about her.

249
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
What's going on with them?

250
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,240
They're just having a little trouble communicating.

251
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,570
My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice

252
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,910
makes him want to tear his ears off

253
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,850
and sew them over his eyes

254
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,600
so he never has to look at her again.

255
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,670
Hi.

256
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,680
- Hey, guys. - Hello.

257
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,570
Look who's here to put

258
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,270
the "Jew" In "Jewelry Night"!

259
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,100
Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.

260
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,710
Sorry we're late.

261
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,700
I wanted to swing by the lab

262
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,820
and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.

263
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,180
I didn't know you were coming again.

264
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,550
Well, last week was a blast.

265
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,580
Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.

266
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,960
It was not funny.

267
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,390
So, what tools did you bring?

268
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,170
Everything we need to make jewelry molds.

269
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,920
Here's some silver, a crucible

270
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080
and an acetylene torch to melt it down.

271
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,950
Ooh, that looks like fun.

272
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,380
Maybe you should master glue

273
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,710
before you move on to fire.

274
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,110
Okay, who's up first?

275
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,970
Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom

276
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,410
to go with the necklace?

277
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,510
No, thanks.

278
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,420
I was gonna make a necklace for my mom,

279
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,070
but unfortunately, she doesn't have a neck.

280
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,160
She's just chins and fat and feet.

281
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,910
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

282
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,390
Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.

283
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,120
This is so exciting, I-I feel...

284
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,930
like I'm 75 again.

285
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,510
Oh, God.

286
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,650
What... what is it?

287
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,800
Sheldon just sent me a picture

288
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,370
of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

289
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,130
Can-can I ask you a question?

290
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, sure.

291
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,350
W-Why do you put up with Sheldon?

292
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,060
Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,290
Why?

294
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
- Wow, you ask really hard questions. - Yeah.

295
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,930
Look, I-I know he can be aggravating,

296
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,290
but what you have to remember is that

297
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,730
he's not doing it on purpose.

298
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,460
It's just how he is.

299
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,580
But he's also loyal and trustworthy

300
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,070
and we have fun together...

301
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,280
You... you know you're describing a dog.

302
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,940
He did bite me once.

303
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,530
But in his defense,

304
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,570
I came up behind him while he was eating, so...

305
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,730
Yeah, they-they hate that.

306
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,290
You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met.

307
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,910
And he's a little broken and he needs me.

308
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,930
I guess I need him, too.

309
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,970
Why-why is that?

310
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,380
Boy, you will not let this go, will you?

311
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,450
Oh, geez.

312
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,790
Another photo from Sheldon?

313
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,380
No, I have to go pick him up.

314
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,850
Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.

315
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,150
He probably stole his wallet, too.

316
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,010
You know, if you guys are interested,

317
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,360
there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair,

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,280
refine it into carbon dust,

319
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,690
and use the hydraulic press at work

320
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,620
to turn it into a tiny little diamond

321
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,100
with your DNA in it.

322
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,870
Oh, that's amazing!

323
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

324
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,540
That came right off my mom's back.

325
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
He's kidding.

326
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,170
If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.

327
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,020
"My name is Howard.

328
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,410
I can make your hair into diamonds.

329
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,690
My mom is morbidly obese.

330
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,660
Everybody love me."

331
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,050
Whoa, where is that coming from?

332
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,860
I'll tell you where it's coming from.

333
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,870
All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night

334
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,010
and now you're here ruining it for everyone.

335
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,040
Raj, cool it...

336
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,370
he's gonna make us hair diamonds.

337
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
How am I ruining anything?

338
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry.

339
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,710
But this isn't about the jewelry.

340
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,350
This is about me having a place

341
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,650
where I can open up about my feelings.

342
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,770
Since when can't you open up with me?

343
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,250
There are just some things

344
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,110
that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls,

345
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,730
because they won't make fun of me

346
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,130
or and call me names, or ask me if my

347
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,080
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

348
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,510
Buddy, I was just joking around.

349
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,830
Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.

350
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,680
Well, you're right.

351
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,210
I didn't realize I was making you feel that way.

352
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,400
It was very brave of you to tell me.

353
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Thank you.

354
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,070
It wasn't easy.

355
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,500
They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do,

356
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,580
I know it.

357
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,530
Arthur.

358
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,980
Hi, Sheldon.

359
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,850
I'm surprised to see you here.

360
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,160
Yeah, me, too.

361
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,560
Somewhere around the third floor,

362
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I began to see a white light.

363
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,110
I'll get Leonard.

364
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,240
No, no, no, I'm...

365
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm here... I'm here to see you.

366
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,880
If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye,

367
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,490
I can't help you.

368
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,000
I've been informed that he's now

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,830
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

370
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,770
No, I'm...

371
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,380
I-I was thinking, if it isn't too much trouble,

372
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,970
I'd like to get your opinion about my-my paper.

373
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,210
Thank you.

374
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,630
It would be an honor.

375
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,100
Oh. Uh, great.

376
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,770
Well, actually, I don't need that.

377
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,770
I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.

378
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,550
And... what did you think?

379
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,790
Well, first, I think the fact that

380
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,820
you use your birthday as a password

381
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,400
is embarrassing.

382
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
Thank you.

383
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,230
Second, um...

384
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,000
I thought your paper was inspired.

385
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,670
Oh, well, that... that means a lot to me.

386
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,340
Can I invite you in for tea?

387
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,120
Uh, no, no. I-I really...

388
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
I have... I have to run.

389
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
Hey, Arthur. How are you?

390
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,790
Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

391
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,430
Oh, hey, buddy, what's up?

392
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,010
Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night

393
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,700
so I made you a little something.

394
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,230
You didn't have to do that.

395
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,210
Well, it was fun.

396
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,740
I used some of the jewelry techniques you taught us.

397
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,890
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

398
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,600
Wow, this is so cool, thanks.

399
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,670
Oh gets better.

400
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,200
And that's not even the best part. See?

401
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,530
I have one, too.

402
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,050
Check it out.

403
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,130
You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights

404
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,390
whenever we want.

405
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,370
Yeah, and my eighth favorite episode of Professor Proton

406
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,420
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

407
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,850
You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,

408
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,880
oh, what a blast-off it is."

409
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,500
Remember? Remember that?

410
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,880
Remember?

411
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,940
He can't help it. He can't.

412
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,110
He really can't.

413
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,430
You wait here.

414
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,550
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

415
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,690
we can build that rocket,

416
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,930
and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house.

417
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,560
As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.

418
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,450
So, you, uh...

419
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,370
you have... you have any...

420
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,130
single grandmothers?

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,570
- Sorry, they're both married. - Good.

422
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,800
H-Happily?
