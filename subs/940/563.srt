生活大爆炸
第七季  第七集

13
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,130
我从没见过他这么欢乐
I've never seen him this happy before.

14
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,190
那是因为你从来没有在
That's because you've never seen him

15
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,820
"医药箱补货日"见过他
on "Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

16
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,220
你们看
Look!

17
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,910
新出的带麻药局部抗组胺剂呢
A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine.

18
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,010
好想赶快发疹子来用用看啊
I can't wait until I get a rash.

19
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,590
解胀气药也出了加强版呢
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

20
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,760
看来他们真会看顾客意见邮箱啊
I guess they really do read their mail.

21
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,400
那不是质子教授吗
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

22
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,770
是啊
Oh, yeah.

23
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,230
你们看他  像普通人一样排队
Look at him, just standing in line

24
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,540
好像自己30年前并不是个二流名人似地
like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago.

25
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,320
去跟他打招呼吧
Let's go say hello.

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,370
我们还是别烦人家比较好吧
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

27
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,990
我没有要去烦他啊  我是要去跟他聊聊
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.

28
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,640
他总以为这两者不一样
He thinks there's a difference.

29
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,830
亚瑟
Arthur?

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,620
亚瑟  是我啊
Arthur, it's me--

31

谢尔顿・库珀
Sheldon Cooper.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,420
你可能因为年事已高忘了我是谁了
You may not remember because of your advanced age.

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,080
相信我  你化成灰我也认得
Trust me, I... I remember.

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,280
这位是我的女朋友  艾米
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,960
艾米  这位是电视圈传奇亚瑟・杰弗里斯
Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries.

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,690
他的科普节目启发了无数孩子
His science show inspired millions of children.

37
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,740
等  等等
Ho-hold on.

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,650
你...  你有女朋友啊
You... You have a girlfriend?

39
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,000
是的  久仰大名啊
Yes, and I've heard so much about you.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,720
而且你看  我们穿着同款矫正鞋呢
Hey look-- we're wearing the same orthopedic shoes.

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
真不敢相信我跟名人穿同样的鞋
I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.

42
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,850
现在我明白了
O-Okay, I get it now.

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,570
你好  我是莱纳德・霍夫斯塔德
Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.

44
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,910
是你啊  我记得你的女朋友
Oh, oh, right, I remember your-your girlfriend.

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,560
她...  她在吗
Is-Is she... is she here?

46
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,240
她不在这里
No, she's not.

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,290
你是来补什么药的存货呢
So, what prescription are you getting filled?

48
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,090
-谢尔顿  -别说  让我猜猜
- Sheldon. - Wait, I want to guess.

49
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,550
别告诉我答案
Don't tell me.

50
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,350
我本来就没打算告诉你
I wasn't going to tell you.

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,810
谢尔顿  别玩了
Sheldon, come on.

52
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,030
不不不  玩这个我最拿手了
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,970
好  给我的提示
All right, give me a hint.

54
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,940
是不是跟排某些液体有困难有关
Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,930
看我的年纪就知道  猜中很容易吧
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.

56
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,620
谢尔顿  我们还是去取笑
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,370
买顺势疗法药的人吧  你不是很喜欢吗  
buying homeopathic medicine-- you love that.

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,970
但是我现在跟朋友一起
But I'm hanging out with my friend,

59
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,220
我们聊得正欢呢
and we're having fun.

60
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,830
你看他多开心
Look how happy he is.

61
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,390
妮妮这周五要在家里办闺蜜之夜
Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place.

62
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,750
不如那晚咱俩出去玩呀
You want to do something?

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,300
-那晚我有事呢  -什么事
- Actually, I'm busy. - Doing what?

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,720
科罗拉多大街那边开了一家新体育酒吧...
There's a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave...

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,230
-你也要去参加闺蜜之夜  -是啦
- You're going to girls' night. - Yeah.

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,140
你知道她们是要串珠宝的对吧
You know they're making jewelry, right?

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,510
你以为那主意是她们想出来的吗
You think they came up with that?

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,630
她们本来是要喝啤酒  射飞镖好吗
They were going to drink beer and play darts.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,620
怎么样啦[什么上升]
What's up?

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,070
绝对不是他的睾丸酮水平
Not his testosterone levels.

71
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,020
别乱说
Excuse me.

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,120
人家对自己的男子气概很满意好咩
I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,480
这怎么可能
How is that possible?

74
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,810
质子教授给我发了电邮
Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.

75
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,320
好耶  他说什么了
Goody! What's it say?

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,140
他在写一篇纳米真空管的论文
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes,

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,620
问我能不能帮他看看
and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.

78
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,550
奇怪
That's strange.

79
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,250
他居然会找你  而不是找我帮忙
That he would come to you for that and not me.

80
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,900
我收到他两封电邮呢
Oh, I got two emails from him.

81
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,720
"你有莱纳德的邮箱吗"
"Do you have Leonard's email address?"

82
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,610
还有
And...

83
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,300
"不用了  我找到了"
"Never mind, I found it."

84
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,190
他居然会选你不选我
I can't believe he picked you over me.

85
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,500
你也不会想看一篇好几十年没正经
You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,860
搞过科研的过气老头写的论文呢
who hasn't done any real science in decades.

87
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
这有什么好哭诉的
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,350
谢尔顿・库伯才不哭呢
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

89
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,920
有道理  你个机器人碰水会生锈
It's true, you'd rust.

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,620
想到我居然曾经当他是我偶像
And to think I idolized that man.

91
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,980
我何苦呢
And why?

92
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,050
说到底  他不过也是个好莱坞伪君子罢了
At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony.

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,320
这事情真的值得你不开心吗
Is it really worth getting upset about?

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,210
常言道  别见你心中的英雄
They say don't meet your heroes.

95
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
不要窥探他们名望与名声背后的真实
Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity,

96
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
如果你犯了这禁忌  你会看到真实的他们
because if you do, you'll see them as they really are--

97
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,370
堕落的卖笑戏子
degenerate carnival folk.

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,330
别这样  他只是个退休的儿童节目主持
Come on, he's a retired kids show host.

99
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,500
这才更糟呢
That's even worse.

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,710
用美好的科学当糖果
Using the sweet candy of science

101
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,830
骗取小孩对他的爱慕
to trick children into loving him.

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,440
死淫贼
Pervert.

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,270
你有仔细想过
Have you ever thought about

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,000
为什么亚瑟没找你读论文吗
why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?

105
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,410
我想过
Yes, I have.

106
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,740
我唯一的结论就是
And my only conclusion

107
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,610
他那天在药房买的药
is the prescription he was picking up the other day

108
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,470
是要治神经病的
was for cuckoo pills.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,020
有可能是他觉得你有点过了吧
Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.

110
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,360
你这话说得才过吧
That's kind of a stretch.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,010
要说社交技巧
Look, when it comes to social skills,

112
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,460
我已经掌握了三大技巧
I've mastered the big three.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,590
首先是腼腆一笑
There's the coy smile.

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,350
以及友善的轻笑
There's the friendly chuckle.

115
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,550
以及如何发出同情音
There's the vocalization of sympathy.

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,290
最后这个太难了  我还在练
That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.

117
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,980
就我那天看到的情况来看
From what I saw the other day,

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,620
我能理解他或...
I could understand why he and...

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,800
有些人可能会觉得你
some people might find you...

120
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,980
什么
What?

121
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,040
算了
Doesn't matter.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,130
不行  快说
No, go ahead, say it.

123
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,630
我知道你想说什么
I know what it is.

124
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,070
我这辈子听过无数遍了
I've heard it my whole life.

125
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,260
你想说的是"惹人厌"
The word's "annoying".

126
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,570
说吧  说吧
Go ahead, say it.

127
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,560
快说  说我惹人厌
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

128
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,900
我才不会觉得受伤
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

130
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,730
说吧  艾米  说我惹人厌啊
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

131
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,200
我惹人厌  我超级惹人厌
I'm annoying. I'm annoying.

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
我最惹人厌了  没错
I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh...

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,430
你要去哪里
Now where are you going?

134
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,900
你知道你想说出口  快说啊
Look, you know you want to say it-- say it.

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,390
说我惹人厌  快说啊
Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,090
说啊  艾米  快说啊
Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,050
这妞不能忍受我是对的就走啊
Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.

138
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,390
真有意思
This is fun.

139
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,160
我会像戴着珠宝的那种傲娇的贵妇
I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,220
只不过我不会对一大堆药物过敏
that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,700
佩妮  你做得怎么样
Penny, how's it going over there?

142
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,660
很好  只是我有点搞不定胶水
Good-- I'm just having little trouble with the glue.

143
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,030
你难道不会用胶水吗
How do you not know how to use glue?

144
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,130
你学前班老逃课了吧
Did you ditch pre-school?

145
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,790
是啊  当时我忙着跟二年级的学生约会呢
Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.

146
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,600
各位好啊
Hello, everyone.

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,990
好吧  你想说什么就说吧
Okay, let me have it.

148
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,960
你只管开"拉杰是娘们"的玩笑好了
Let's hear all the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

149
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,620
你想错了
Nope.

150
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,310
伯纳黛特说这样不对  她不许我这样
Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

151
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,000
那还真是多谢了
Thank you.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
所以我不会嘲笑你
So I won't be making fun of you,

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,670
也不会耻笑你喜欢的事物
or the things you like,

154
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
更不会讥笑你"只想玩乐"的事实
or the fact that you just want to have fun.

155
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
源自辛迪・劳帕的著名单曲《Girls Just Wanna Have Fun 女孩们只想玩乐》

156
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,440
华仔  别说了
Howie, stop.

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,290
过来看看我做的东西
Come on, look at what I'm making.

158
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
还挺好看的嘛
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

159
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
我在做手镯
I'm making a bracelet.

160
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,860
而我做的是"一团糟"
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,640
你们其实可以拿我的焊铁玩
You know, instead of beads and glue,

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
而不是在这光玩珠子和胶水
you guys can use my soldering iron.

163
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
这样你们可以做更酷的东西
You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,410
我觉得这样就挺好  谢啦
Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.

165
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,120
-老实说  我想试试  -我也是
- Actually, I'd kind of like to try that. - Me, too.

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,970
马上给你们拿来
Be right back.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,240
我胳膊上怎么黏有开心果
When did I have pistachios?

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,670
亚瑟
Arthur.

169
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,380
亚瑟
Arthur.

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,400
亚瑟
Arthur.

171
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,410
门环
Door knocker.

172
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,630
从那个电视节目赚的吧
That's TV money.

173
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,630
同名DIY电视节目

174
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,430
谢尔顿  你来这儿干嘛
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

175
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,150
抱歉  我吵醒你了吗
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

176
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,790
当然啦  现在都晚上7点半了
Of course you woke me, it's 7:30.

177
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,550
本来我可以早点到的
Well, I would have been here sooner,

178
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,010
但不知道为什么
but for some reason your home

179
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,210
你家不在"好莱坞明星之家"这幅地图上
isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,590
你找我有事吗  谢尔顿
What do you want, Sheldon?

181
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,610
我的女朋友指出
It's been pointed out by my girlfriend

182
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,140
那天我可能惹到你了
that I may have been annoying to you.

183
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,600
这么懂事的姑娘你可别放手
She sounds like a keeper.

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,300
总之我想跟你道歉
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

185
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,770
真的很对不起
I am truly sorry.

186
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,970
好的  我接受你的道歉  晚安
All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.

187
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,750
不  还有呢  既然我们冰释前嫌
No, no, now that... we've cleared the air,

188
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,440
我还想跟你商量一件事
I wanted to discuss another matter with you.

189
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,140
谢尔顿  再过两个小时  我就得起床
Sheldon, in a couple hours, I have to get up,

190
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,470
尿个尿  然后在房子里游荡[梦游]
pee and then wander around the house.

191
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,060
那我长话短说
Well, then, I'll make this quick.

192
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,640
我想跟你谈谈你发给莱纳德那篇论文
Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard.

193
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,510
我知道他说可行性很高
Now, I know he said it's promising

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,400
他也打算跟你合作
and he's going to collaborate on it,

195
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,730
但现在我们又是朋友了
but now that you and I are friends again,

196
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,360
我随时听候您差遣
I am at your disposal.

197
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,380
坦白说  借助我的名字和声望会对论文大有帮助
Frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help,

198
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,850
因为很多人都认为你已经是"过气的前浪"
because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been.

199
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,290
或已经"死在沙滩上"了
Or dead.

200
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,610
那我真是走了大运啊
I should be so lucky.

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,350
那你觉得怎么样
So, uh, what do you say?

202
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,780
如果你还是跟以前一样
You know, if it's all the same with you,

203
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,930
那我还是继续跟莱纳德合作吧
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

204
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,060
因为我惹人厌  对吧
It's because I'm annoying, right?

205
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,000
我知道  说啊
I know it is. Say it.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
快说  说我惹人厌
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

207
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,130
-晚安  -说啊
- Good night. - Say it.

208
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,170
亚瑟  说啊  说我惹人厌
Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying.

209
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,950
说啊  快说啊
Say it. Say it.

210
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,020
说我惹人厌
I'm annoying. Say it.

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
你超级惹人厌
You're annoying!

212
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,150
人家好伤心啊
Wow, that really hurt.

213
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,340
如果在我小时候  有人跟我说
If you would have told me when I was a kid

214
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,880
我长大后会有机会
that someday I would be doing science

215
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,380
跟质子教授一起做实验
next to Professor Proton,

216
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,500
我一定不会相信
I would not have believed you.

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,540
如果有人跟我说
If someone had told me

218
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,040
人们在我83岁的时候
that people would still call me Professor Proton

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
还会称我为"质子教授"
when I was 83 years old,

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,180
我肯定不会戒烟
I never would have quit smoking.

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,370
抱歉  杰弗里斯博士  我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited.

222
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,360
你对于纳米真空管的想法很有意思
This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is really interesting.

223
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
你好啊  莱纳德
Hello, Leonard.

224
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,160
你好  亚瑟
Oh, hello, Arthur.

225
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,810
你们俩都在这里  真是意外的巧合呀
What an odd coincidence that you're both here.

226
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,240
有什么巧合的
Why is it odd?

227
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,030
因为碰巧的是  我今天也跟一位
Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day

228
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,160
深受儿童喜爱的电视科学明星在一起
with a beloved children's television science personality.

229
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,590
对不对呀  我的新友兼新同事
Isn't that right, new friend and colleague,

230
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,840
美国科教节目《比尔・奈教科学》主持人

231
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,840
教科学的比尔・奈
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

232
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,160
不好意思  我用新型号替换了你
Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.

233
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,910
亚瑟・杰弗里斯
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

234
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,280
见到您真是太荣幸了
It's an honor to meet you.

235
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,620
没有您的铺垫  也不会有我的节目
My show never would have happened without yours.

236
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
所以我跟我律师说你是抄袭我
That's what I told my lawyers.

237
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,470
奈先生  你好
Mr. Nye, hello.

238
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,330
被他把你卷进这无谓的纷争里  真是抱歉
I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.

239
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,630
他说是请我来给学生上课的
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

240
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,470
不对  我是说请你来给某人上一课[教训]
No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson.

241
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,720
好了  走吧
Now let's go.

242
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,510
你们在研究什么呢
What are you guys working on?

243
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,730
我们在研制纳米真空管
Oh, uh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

244
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,490
很有意思嘛
That's interesting.

245
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,930
你从我这里偷的哽还不够吗
Haven't you stolen enough from me?

246
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,950
走开啦  领结男
Back off, bow tie!

247
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,240
各位
Hey, guys...

248
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,020
这一副怎么样
What do you think?

249
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,990
佩妮  做得真漂亮
Wow, Penny, good job.

250
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,990
谢了  在商场买的  4块99
Thanks. Target, $4.99.

251
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,360
我再去倒一杯酒
I'm getting a drink.

252
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,710
你在做什么呢
What are you working on?

253
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,540
帮我妈做一串项链
Oh, I'm making a necklace for my mom.

254
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,520
真孝顺
That's sweet.

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,810
最近她和我爸的
Yeah, she and my dad are going through

256
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,170
关系有点紧张
a bit of a rough patch, so

257
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,290
所以我想表示一下让她知道
I wanted to do something to let her know

258
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,580
我挂念着她
I was thinking about her.

259
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
他们干嘛吵架呢
What's going on with them?

260
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,240
他们有点小小的沟通不良
They're just having a little trouble communicating.

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,570
我爸说我妈的声音
My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice

262
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,910
让他想把自己耳朵揪下来
makes him want to tear his ears off

263
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,850
再缝在他的眼睛上
and sew them over his eyes

264
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,600
这样他就永远不用再看见她了
so he never has to look at her again.

265
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,670
嗨
Hi.

266
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,680
-大家好啊  -嗨
- Hey, guys. - Hello.

267
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,570
看看是谁把
Look who's here to put

268
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,270
犹太和珠宝音似

269
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,270
"犹太人"带进"珠宝之夜"了
the "Jew" In "Jewelry Night"!

270
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,100
种族笑话你自己说就没关系是吧
Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.

271
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,710
抱歉我们迟到了
Sorry we're late.

272
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,700
我顺便去了实验室
I wanted to swing by the lab

273
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,820
把更给力的工具给搬来了
and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.

274
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,180
我没想到你居然又出现了
I didn't know you were coming again.

275
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,550
上周还挺好玩的
Well, last week was a blast.

276
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,580
再说  我想你们也愿意有个男士陪伴吧
Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.

277
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,960
其实一点也不好笑
It was not funny.

278
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,390
那你带了什么工具来
So, what tools did you bring?

279
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,170
各种制作珠宝模子的工具
Everything we need to make jewelry molds.

280
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,920
银  坩埚
Here's some silver, a crucible

281
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080
还有用来融化的乙炔炬
and an acetylene torch to melt it down.

282
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,950
这个看起来有意思
Ooh, that looks like fun.

283
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,380
还是等你先搞定胶水
Maybe you should master glue

284
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,710
再学习玩火吧
before you move on to fire.

285
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,110
好了  谁想先玩啊
Okay, who's up first?

286
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,970
拉杰什  你想再做一副和那项链
Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom

287
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,410
搭配的手镯送给你妈吗
to go with the necklace?

288
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,510
不用了
No, thanks.

289
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,420
我也想给我妈做一串项链
I was gonna make a necklace for my mom,

290
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,070
可惜  她胖得脖子都没有
but unfortunately, she doesn't have a neck.

291
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,160
她下巴之下是脂肪  脂肪之下就是脚
She's just chins and fat and feet.

292
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,910
好  我们马上就可以开始了
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

293
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,390
把线连上  就可以开始测试这些管子了
Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.

294
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,120
太让人激动了  我觉得
This is so exciting, I-I feel...

295
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,930
就像重新回到75岁一样
like I'm 75 again.

296
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,510
老天爷
Oh, God.

297
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,650
出...什么事了
What... what is it?

298
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,800
谢尔顿发了一张
Sheldon just sent me a picture

299
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,370
他和比尔・奈一起喝冰沙的照片
of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

300
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,130
我  我能问个问题吗
Can-can I ask you a question?

301
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,560
当然  问吧
Yeah, sure.

302
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,350
你怎么能忍受谢尔顿这种人啊
W-Why do you put up with Sheldon?

303
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,060
因为我们是朋友呀
Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.

304
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,290
为什么呀
Why?

305
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
-你真喜欢给人出难题  -当然
- Wow, you ask really hard questions. - Yeah.

306
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,930
我知道他总是惹人厌
Look, I-I know he can be aggravating,

307
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,290
但你要知道
but what you have to remember is that

308
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,730
他不是故意的
he's not doing it on purpose.

309
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,460
只是他这人天性如此
It's just how he is.

310
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,580
其实他很忠诚也很可靠
But he's also loyal and trustworthy

311
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,070
我们在一起挺开心的
and we have fun together...

312
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,280
你...你知道自己是在描述一只狗吧
You... you know you're describing a dog.

313
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,940
他的确咬过我一次
He did bite me once.

314
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,530
但他解释说
But in his defense,

315
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,570
我在他进食时突然从背后冒出来  所以
I came up behind him while he was eating, so...

316
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,730
狗都不喜欢那样
Yeah, they-they hate that.

317
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,290
谢尔顿是我遇见过的最聪明的家伙
You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met.

318
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,910
他并不是完人  所以才需要我
And he's a little broken and he needs me.

319
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,930
我大概也需要他吧
I guess I need him, too.

320
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,970
为  为什么呢
Why-why is that?

321
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,380
你非得打破沙锅问到底  是吧
Boy, you will not let this go, will you?

322
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,450
我的天
Oh, geez.

323
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,790
又是谢尔顿发来的照片吗
Another photo from Sheldon?

324
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,380
不是  我得去接他一下
No, I have to go pick him up.

325
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,850
比尔・奈把他抛弃在冰沙店了
Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.

326
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,150
大概把他的钱包也顺手偷走了
He probably stole his wallet, too.

327
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,010
如果你们感兴趣的话
You know, if you guys are interested,

328
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,360
有种技术可以让我把你们的一束头发
there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair,

329
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,280
提炼成碳粉
refine it into carbon dust,

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,690
然后用实验室的液压器
and use the hydraulic press at work

331
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,620
把它转变成一颗小小的钻石
to turn it into a tiny little diamond

332
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,100
里面还有你自己的DNA哦
with your DNA in it.

333
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,870
太神奇了吧
Oh, that's amazing!

334
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
看到妮妮订婚戒指了吗
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

335
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,540
原料是我妈背部的体毛
That came right off my mom's back.

336
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
他开玩笑的
He's kidding.

337
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,170
真是这样  钻石会大得多
If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.

338
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,020
我叫霍华德
"My name is Howard.

339
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,410
我可以把你的毛发变成钻石
I can make your hair into diamonds.

340
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,690
我妈有病态肥胖症
My mom is morbidly obese.

341
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,660
人人都爱我
Everybody love me."

342
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,050
为啥一股很不爽我的口气
Whoa, where is that coming from?

343
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,860
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you where it's coming from.

344
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,870
你之前嘲笑我参加闺蜜之夜
All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night

345
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,010
现在你又跑来这里毁了大家的好时光
and now you're here ruining it for everyone.

346
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,040
拉杰  淡定
Raj, cool it...

347
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,370
他要给咱们做钻石呢
he's gonna make us hair diamonds.

348
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
我怎么毁了你们的好时光
How am I ruining anything?

349
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,070
我只是想帮你把珠宝做得更好
I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry.

350
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,710
但是重点不在珠宝
But this isn't about the jewelry.

351
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,350
而在于在这里
This is about me having a place

352
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,650
我可以敞开心扉  无所不谈
where I can open up about my feelings.

353
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,770
你什么时候开始不能对我敞开心扉谈了
Since when can't you open up with me?

354
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,250
有些话题
There are just some things

355
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,110
我觉得和姑娘们说更自在
that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls,

356
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,730
因为她们不会嘲笑我
because they won't make fun of me

357
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,130
不会给我取绰号  或是问我
or and call me names, or ask me if my

358
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,080
库萨帕里你的内裤是不是卷在了一起
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

359
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,080
意为因为小事就发脾气

360
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,510
兄弟  我那是开玩笑的
Buddy, I was just joking around.

361
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,830
有时候你的玩笑很伤人
Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.

362
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,680
你说得对
Well, you're right.

363
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,210
我没意识到会让你有这种感受
I didn't realize I was making you feel that way.

364
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,400
你能坦白告诉我真是太勇敢了
It was very brave of you to tell me.

365
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,280
谢谢
Thank you.

366
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,070
对我来说不容易
It wasn't easy.

367
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,500
他们会抢在我和谢尔顿之前先上床  
They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do,

368
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,580
我就知道
I know it.

369
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,530
亚瑟
Arthur.

370
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,980
你好  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

371
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,850
真意外在这里看见你
I'm surprised to see you here.

372
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,160
我也意外
Yeah, me, too.

373
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,560
我爬到三楼时
Somewhere around the third floor,

374
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
我眼前都开始出现白光了[回光返照]
I began to see a white light.

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,110
我去叫莱纳德
I'll get Leonard.

376
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,240
不用  我...
No, no, no, I'm...

377
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,220
我是来找你的
I'm here... I'm here to see you.

378
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,880
如果你想通过我的关系找比尔・奈
If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye,

379
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,490
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

380
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,000
我已经被通知他现在是
I've been informed that he's now

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,830
限制令男比尔・奈
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

382
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,770
不是  我...
No, I'm...

383
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,380
我想  如果不太麻烦的话
I-I was thinking, if it isn't too much trouble,

384
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,970
我希望你给我的论文提提意见
I'd like to get your opinion about my-my paper.

385
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,210
谢谢
Thank you.

386
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,630
这是我的荣幸
It would be an honor.

387
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,100
太好了
Oh. Uh, great.

388
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,770
其实你可以不用给我稿子了
Well, actually, I don't need that.

389
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,770
我已经黑进你的邮箱看过了
I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.

390
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,550
那你觉得如何
And... what did you think?

391
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,790
首先  我觉得
Well, first, I think the fact that

392
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,820
你使用生日作为邮箱密码
you use your birthday as a password

393
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,400
这个错误太丢人
is embarrassing.

394
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
多谢提醒
Thank you.

395
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,230
第二
Second, um...

396
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,000
我觉得你的论文极具启发性
I thought your paper was inspired.

397
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,670
你的肯定对我来说意义重大
Oh, well, that... that means a lot to me.

398
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,340
进来喝杯茶好吗
Can I invite you in for tea?

399
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,120
不用了  我真的得...
Uh, no, no. I-I really...

400
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
我得走了
I have... I have to run.

401
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
亚瑟  你好吗
Hey, Arthur. How are you?

402
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,790
喝一杯也无妨
Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

403
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,430
兄弟  什么事
Oh, hey, buddy, what's up?

404
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,010
我为自己那天晚上的表现感到内疚
Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night

405
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,700
所以我给你做了个小礼物
so I made you a little something.

406
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,230
这么客气干嘛呀
You didn't have to do that.

407
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,210
很有趣
Well, it was fun.

408
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,740
我运用了你教我们的珠宝制作技艺
I used some of the jewelry techniques you taught us.

409
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,890
这是一个光剑皮带扣
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

410
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,600
太厉害了  谢谢
Wow, this is so cool, thanks.

411
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,670
好戏在后头
Oh gets better.

412
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,200
更精彩的好戏还在后面  瞧
And that's not even the best part. See?

413
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,530
我也有一个
I have one, too.

414
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,050
你瞧
Check it out.

415
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,130
你可以戴上你的  咱们随时可以来一场
You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,390
激情小剑大比拼
whenever we want.

417
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,370
质子教授节目  我心中排名第八的那集是
Yeah, and my eighth favorite episode of Professor Proton

418
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,420
泡腾剂式消化片火箭
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

419
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,850
你说  扑通扑通  嘶嘶嘶嘶
You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,

420
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,880
精彩的发射来一次
oh, what a blast-off it is."

421
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,500
记得吗  记得这集吗
Remember? Remember that?

422
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,880
记得吗
Remember?

423
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,940
他就是这德行  就是这样
He can't help it. He can't.

424
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,110
他真的没办法
He really can't.

425
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,430
你等着
You wait here.

426
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,550
我去拿些消化片
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

427
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,690
我们可以造出火箭
we can build that rocket,

428
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,930
然后朝着比尔・奈家发射
and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house.

429
