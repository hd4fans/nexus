6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,710
没有鱼道
No fish ladders.

7
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,550
我还以为水坝必须设置鱼道
I thought they all had to have fish ladders.

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,510
不知道他们是怎么做到的
Wonder how they got around that one.

9
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,510
不过他们肯定有水泵
But they got to have vacuums.

10
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,470
把鱼直接抽出来  扔到卡车后面
Well, shoot 'em out into the back of a truck...

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,790
我想那是只黄鹂
Think that was an oriole.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,220
我不知道这还有那种鸟
I didn't know we had those.

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,820
在这等着
Wait here.

14
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,100
你没好好等着
You didn't wait.

15
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,630
乔希去哪了
Where's Josh?

16
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,820
散步去了
He took a walk.

17
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,070
我们看到  灾难正在各地
The disaster we see is happening everywhere

18
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,270
同时发生
at the same time.

19
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,070
危机迫在眉睫
The clock is ticking.

20
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,470
自工业革命开始
It has been ticking for 150 years now,

21
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,430
至今已过去了150年
since the dawn of industrialization.

22
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,790
我们一味执迷于利益  产品
We are a culture hooked on profit, production,

23
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,190
永无止境的增长
and perpetual growth,

24
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,030
但代价又是什么
but at what cost?

25
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,270
灾难正在吞噬我们的农场
The disaster is happening to our farmlands.

26
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,190
我们的海洋
It is happening to our oceans,

27
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,390
我们的森林和野生动物
our forests, our wildlife.

28
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,190
它正影响着我们的气候
It is happening to our climate.

29
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,030
要用多久人类才能明白
How long will it be until humanity understands

30
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,470
万事万物都是互相联系的
that everything is interconnected?

31
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,710
要用多久跨国公司才能明白
How long until multinational corporations

32
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,430
他们不能从垂死的星球上获取利益
understand that they can't make a profit off a dead planet?

33
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,350
所以让我们在全球范围内开始这场革命
So let the revolution begin, all around the globe.

34
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,590
每位公民必须站起来投入这场战斗
An army of individual citizens must rise up and take a stand

35
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,950
为了未来  为了人类  为了地球
for the future, for the people,

36
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,030
表明立场
and for the planet.

37
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,110
谢谢你们
Thank you.

38
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,710
感谢来参加活动的所有人
Thank you all for coming out.

39
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,030
今晚影片制作人也来到了现场
And as you know, we have the filmmaker here tonight,

40
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,390
来自尤金市的洁基·克里斯蒂森
Jackie Christianson from Eugene.

41
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,830
这真是个绝妙的  了不起的杰作
That was tremendous, amazing work.

42
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,390
非常感谢你能与我们分享
Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

43
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,550
现在如果你们有任何问题
Now if you have any questions,

44
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,390
她已经准备好一一解答
she's ready to take them if you've got them.

45
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,190
-对吗  洁基  -是的
- Is that right, Jackie? - Yeah.

46
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,870
我只想感谢你  洁基
Yeah, I just want to thank you, Jackie,

47
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,910
分享振奋人心  带给人们希望的视频
for that uplifting, hopeful vision there.

48
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,990
真的很棒
It was really awesome.

49
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,510
我觉得如果你用
I feel like if you bombard people

50
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,510
这么多可怕的图片吓唬人
with too many horrific images,

51
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,030
只会让人觉得为时已晚  难以应对
it just feels like it's too late or too much to take on.

52
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,870
它充满了末日情怀
It fulfills the end-of-world vision.

53
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,470
指望那些人的话
Well, you're not going to get anywhere

54
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,550
什么也做不了
with those people anyway.

55
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,790
迪娜
Dena?

56
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,550
我想说  即便是世界末日
Yeah, I mean, end of the world,

57
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,910
又能损失什么
what's there really to lose?

58
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,430
但洁基  我很好奇  你认为
But, Jackie, I'm curious... What you think it is exactly

59
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,750
我们究竟要怎么做
that we're supposed to do?

60
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,070
你有什么伟大的计划吗
Do you have some sort of big plan or?

61
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,150
我想  这种指望一个伟大的计划的想法
I think this one big plan thinking

62
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,710
导致了很多我们正在面临的问题
leads to a lot of the problems we're facing.

63
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,550
对于我来说  不应该认为
Part of the idea for me, is not thinking

64
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,270
只有一个伟大的计划
there's just one big thing.

65
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,470
我不想专注于什么伟大的计划  
I'm not focused on big plans. 

66
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,790
我只想专注于小计划
I'm focused on small plans.

67
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,190
很多小计划
A lot of small plans.

68
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,350
我想只要我们齐心协力
I think just by us coming together

69
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,540
共同关心一件事
and sharing our concerns in one...

70
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,990
我们什么时候跟你的人见面
What time are we meeting your guy?

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,150
我们约好11点
We said 11:00.

72
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,630
11点
11:00.

73
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,630
我们肯定到不了
We're not gonna make it.

74
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,470
那家伙看起来也没什么事要做
The guy didn't really seem like he had a lot going on.

75
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,750
我可以给他打个电话
I could give him a call, though.

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,990
不  不
No, no.

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,580
我现在不想去找公共电话
I don't want to find a pay phone right now.

78
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,590
放轻松  乔希
Breathe, Josh.

79
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,230
好吧
Okay.

80
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,910
我们很快就能到
We'll be there soon.

81
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,020
一切都好
All is well.

82
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,070
舷内配有5L的V8发动机
Got a inboard 5-liter V-8 engine.

83
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,270
它看起来真的很漂亮
Well, it looks really nice.

84
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,070
是啊  这是艘很棒的船
Yeah. It's a great boat.

85
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,150
-有点舍不得她  -那是肯定的
- Kind of hate to get rid of her. - I'm sure.

86
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,870
我可以告诉你  开船去滑水很开心
Lot of good skiing, I can tell you that.

87
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,710
但是  该做出改变了
But, you know, time for a change.

88
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,590
两个孩子都去了大学
Both kids off to college.

89
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,790
不过开船去滑水还是很开心
Lot of good skiing though.

90
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,150
请问能用下您的卫生间吗
May I use your bathroom?

91
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,470
当然
Uh, yeah, sure.

92
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,230
穿过那边车库上楼
Through the garage there, up the stairs.

93
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,100
-谢谢  -没事
- Thanks. - Yeah.

94
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,150
我是护士  他在超市工作
I'm a nurse. He works at a supermarket.

95
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,380
哪一个
What one?

96
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,230
你们应该修理一下那些刹车灯
You definitely want those brake lights working.

97
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,510
好了  准备就绪
All right, we're good.

98
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,310
好啊
All right.

99
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,230
我们一直想要一艘船
Well, we've always wanted a boat.

100
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,540
真不敢相信美梦成真  对吗  亲爱的
Can't believe this is happening, right, honey?

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,500
不  我不饿
No, not hungry.

102
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,110
我们快到了吗
Are we almost there?

103
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,580
我们现在一定是在怀俄明州
We must be in Wyoming by now, 

104
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,990
下一站是达科塔州
coming up on the Dakotas.

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,590
我不知道  也许还要半小时
I don't know. Half an hour, maybe.

106
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,390
他住得挺远
He's pretty out there.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,030
你之前说他住得很近
I thought you said he lived close.

108
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,510
是的
He does.

109
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,870
很近
This is close.

110
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,030
这才是很近
This is close.

111
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,270
我们已经走了这么远
We've already gone like this.

112
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,710
现在要走这么远吗
Are we going like this?

113
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,550
如果是的话就直说
You can tell me, if we are.

114
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,990
离现在的位置很近  好吧
It's close for here, okay?

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,550
又不是康尼狄格州
This isn't Connecticut.

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,150
-不是吗  -不是
- It's not? - No.

117
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,500
糟糕  我肯定是下错站了
Shit, I must've got off on the wrong train.

118
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,590
那是什么
What is that?

119
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,550
鹿
Deer.

120
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,870
你要停车
You're stopping?

121
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,870
它身子在路上
It's half in the road.

122
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,740
还有体温
It's warm.

123
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,820
什么意思
What does that mean?

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,830
是只母鹿
It's a doe.

125
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,260
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

126
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,590
宝宝还活着
The baby's alive in there.

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,020
天啊
Oh, my God.

128
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,310
你们从哪弄来的
Where'd you get this thing?

129
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,310
梅德福市
Medford.

130
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,740
梅德福市
Medford.

131
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,950
-派对游艇  -是的
- Party barge. - Yeah.

132
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,950
你肯定是迪
You must be D.

133
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,390
你是臭名昭著的哈
You're the infamous H.

134
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,390
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

135
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,230
乐意为您效劳
At your service.

136
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,550
夜色行动
Night Moves?

137
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,980
聪明
Slick.

138
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,390
其实可以叫  去钓鱼或者春梦
We could've had Gone Fishin' or Wet Dream,

139
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,870
可那听上去有点逊
but those sounded kind of lame.

140
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,950
还可以叫  兴风作浪  迷乱荒野
There was Makin' Waves, Reel Wild.

141
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,270
理解吗  和鱼线轴是一个词
Get it? Reel, two Es.

142
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,430
挺不错吧
Pretty awesome.

143
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,950
疯狂牙买加  乱世佳人
Jamaican Me Crazy, Gone With the Wind,

144
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,950
{\an8}直译  随风而去

145
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,270
都想过了
looked at all those.

146
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,290
好了  你怎么想的  
All right. So what do you think? 

147
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,310
大小足够吗
Size-wise, is this gonna work?

148
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,390
你有钥匙吗
You got a key?

149
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,060
有
Yeah.

150
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,870
很好  空间很大
Good. Good space.

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,100
我们要把这些都拆出来
We'll take all of this out.

152
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,230
很好
Yeah.

153
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,110
你们花多少钱买的
How much this set you back anyway?

154
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,150
不便宜
It wasn't cheap.

155
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,190
肯定的
I bet.

156
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,710
你们用的现金  对吗
You paid cash, right?

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,310
没有  我把信用卡账号给了那个家伙
No, I gave the guy my credit card number

158
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,090
然后要他去查看我的网页
and then told him to check out my webpage,

159
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,430
然后我转发到了脸谱网上
and then I posted it on Facebook

160
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,870
这样所有人都能看到
so everyone else could see it too.

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,990
现金
Cash,

162
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,150
穷人的钱
the poor people's money.

163
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,910
看起来还不错
So it looks all right?

164
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,910
挺好的
Oh, yeah.

165
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,790
足够了
She'll do.

166
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,190
真遗憾
It's a shame.

167
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,870
怎么不是艘破船
It's not a bad ship here.

168
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,030
如果好好开  还能用好几年
It's got years left in her if you treated her right.

169
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,470
如果要留下
If I was keeping her,

170
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,470
只有几个地方要简单修理下
I'd say there are some easy repairs to do.

171
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,910
但我猜我们也没指望她经久耐用  对吧
But, uh, I guess we don't give a shit about longevity, do we?

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,580
确实
Nope.

173
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,510
见到你很高兴  哥们
Good to see you, brother.

174
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,870
我也是  哈蒙  好久不见
Yeah, you, too, Harmon. It's been a while.

175
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,390
你从来不过来找我
Well, you never come around.

176
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,150
你也是啊
Well, neither do you.

177
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,390
好吧
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,510
你把车停那边  好吗
Why don't you just park your rig over there, okay?

179
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,180
好
Yeah.

180
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,990
还有要把车头冲里  好吗
And then let's head back inside, all right?

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,310
因为这里经常有缉毒警察
'Cause there's narcs everywhere out here,

182
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,390
而且浣熊也是信不过的
and don't trust the raccoons at all!

那个是在盖高尔夫场吗
Is that what that was?

206
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,750
没有  我们只看到一些翻斗卡车

这里是高原沙漠
It's the high plains desert.

223
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,990
去哪找水
Where's the water?

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,750
对吧
Right?

225
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,230
简直就是扯淡
Absolute bullshit.

226
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,470

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,830
快了  快了是什么意思
Close? What do you mean close?

231
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,860
我们可能还需要几百公斤的化肥
We could use another couple hundred pounds of fertilizer.

232
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,750
不好意思  我以为你已经都准备好了
Sorry, I thought you said that you had it all under control.

233
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,630
没你想的那么简单
I mean, it's not that easy.

234
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,110
我不能总去那里
I can't go in that often.

235
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,270
我还有工作
And I have to work.

236
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,870
好吗
Right?

237
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,750
那些草又不会又不会自己割掉
Those greens don't mow themselves, you know?

238
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,710
那你现在弄到多少
So how much-- how much do you have?

239
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,430
差不多450公斤
1,000 pounds, give or take.

240
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,910
那我们还需要多少
And how much do we need?

241
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,030
220公斤就可以了
500 pounds would be nice.

242
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,590
220公斤
500 pounds?

243
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,950
听着  我们可以只用现有的这些
Look, we can go with what we have.

244
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,910
我是说
I mean...

245
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,390
应该没有问题
it's probably all right.

246
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,270
也许那个大坝自己想倒
God knows that dam wants to come down.

247
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,350
那里的水那么多那么重
There is a serious tonnage of water

248
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,350
一直冲击着它
just pushing up against her walls.

249
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,070
万事万物都在让她投降放弃
Everything in the world is telling her to give up and let go.

250
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,830
但是  我是说
But still, I mean,

251
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,670
我们应该尽所能帮助她  对吗
we should just help her all we can. Right?

252
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,510
那你说我们该怎么做
So what-- what are you saying that we do?

253
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,710
早上我们先去农用品店  仅此而已
Let's go to the feed store in the morning, that's all.

254
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,150
他们不会卖给我们那么多
They're not gonna sell us that much.

255
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,510
只有一种方法能知道
There's just one way to find out.

256
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,750
不  只要超过五公斤
No, anything over 10 pounds

257
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,430
对他们来说就是危险信号
sends up major red flags for these guys.

258
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,670
-那不一定是真的  -是真的
- That's not necessarily true. - It is true.

259
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,350
我们应该尽早知道这些
We should've known about this earlier.

260
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,340
是啊  等一下  让我
Yeah, one second, let me just...

261
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,510
好吧  如果这是我们必须做的
Okay, no, if that's what we got to do.

262
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,870
是啊
Yeah.

263
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,550
好了  我们明天一早出发
All right, we'll go out in the morning.

264
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,830
然后回来这里给火鸡填馅
Then we'll come back here and stuff the turkey.

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,870

we'll all go to work like nothing happened, okay?

270
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,070
他知道他在说什么吧
He knows what he's talking about?

271
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,310
当然
Yeah.

272
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,630
他接受过最好的训练

她是很棒
She's good.

281
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,020
在尤金市  你和她一起做的
She did that thing in Eugene with you,

282
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,430
手机信号塔
the cell towers?

283
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,750
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,150
她提供的资金  我听别人说的
She bankrolled that. That's what I heard.

285
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,630
什么意思  你从哪听来的
What do you mean, that's what you heard?

286
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,870
是你告诉我的  蠢货
Well, you told me that, you dumb-ass.

287
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,350
很好  你是个偏执狂
That's good. You're paranoid.

288
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,310
长远来看  说不定这样更健康
Healthier that way in the long run.

289
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,350
船也是她出的钱
She paid for it.

290
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,590
那船要多少钱
How much was that boat?

291
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,020
一万美金
10 grand.

292
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,420
白富美
Rich daddy.

293
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,830
不过我不懂她为什么一定要来
I don't see why she has to be here, though.

294
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,070
她已经做了很多了
She's done plenty already.

295
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,390
这是约定的一部分
It's part of the deal.

296
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,910
我不懂她为什么不回家
I don't see why she just doesn't go home.

297
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,190
我们明早可以带她去火车站
We can take her down to the train station tomorrow morning.

298
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,190
这跟其他事都不一样  我的朋友
This isn't the same as those other shows, my friend.

299
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,550
这是在另一个高度
This is on a different level.

300
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,590
你知道的
You know that.

301
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,030
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

302
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,230
-不  你知道  -好吧
- No, you know. - Okay.

303
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,910
你当然知道
You definitely know.

304
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,590
这件事会闹得很大
This is gonna be big.

305
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,430
肯定得闹大
Yeah, it's got to be big.

306
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,260
至少要能让人们开始思考
If people are going to start thinking anyway...

307
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,350
就为了每分每秒都能听iPod
killing all the salmon just so you can run

308
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,030
他们可以杀掉所有的三文鱼
your fucking iPod every second of your life.

309
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,230
那将成为现实
And that's what's gonna happen.

310
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,510
人们得开始思考
People are gonna start thinking.

311
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,620
他们必须开始思考
They have to.

312
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,070
你后来还见过兰迪吗
You ever see Randy anymore?

313
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,470
没有  很久没见了
No, not for a while.

314
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,470
上一次听说  他似乎躲在鹰溪
He was squatting in Eagle Creek, last I heard.

315
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,220
溜回山野里去了
Slipping back out into the wild.

316
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,540
幸运儿
Lucky man.

317
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,390
我以为这儿开门更早
I thought it opened earlier.

318
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,150
不好意思
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,550
不会再等太久的
It won't take that much longer.

320
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,030
-别担心  -我没在担心
- Don't worry. - I'm not worried.

321
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,710
-好吧  -不  我们得吃东西
- All right. - No, we got to eat.

322
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,550
顺便给迪娜一个机会做作业
It gives Dena a chance to do her homework.

323
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,790
我已经记住了
I've got it.

324
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,910
你的鸡蛋怎么样
How are your eggs?

325
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,270
看起来很干
They look dry.

326
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,790
我喜欢这种做法
I like them this way.

327
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,790
你应该尝尝看
You should have some.

328
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,030
不
No.

329
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,750
我早上只吃燕麦粥
I only eat oatmeal in the morning.

330
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,350
小女孩  你需要蛋白质
Girl, you need protein.

331
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,710
这样脑子才会更好使
It makes your brain fire better.

332
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,270
相信我  你得吃点鸡蛋
Believe me. You should have some eggs.

333
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,580
我的脑子已经很好使了  燕麦最棒了
My brain fires just fine, mister. Oats are the best.

334
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,630
-最完美的食物  -好了好了
- They're a perfect food. - Okay, okay.

335
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,230
他要是问你为什么要化肥  你怎么说
So what are you gonna say if he asks why you want it?

336
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,870
为了西兰花
For the broccoli.

337
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,910
为了所有需要氮素的该死的西兰花
For all the goddamn broccoli that needs its nitrogen.

338
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,230
我可以的
I'm fine.

339
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,310
别担心
Don't worry about it.

340
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,270
我没在担心
I'm not worried about it.

341
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,470
哈蒙
Harmon.

342
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,750
哥们儿  最近如何
Hey, man. How you doing?

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,070
没惹什么麻烦
Keeping my nose clean, you know.

344
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,630
那就好
Glad to hear it.

345
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,110
日安  兄弟
Well, you have a good day, brother.

346
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,310
-你也是  -放轻松
- You too. - Take it easy.

347
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,740
-好  -回头见
- Yep. - See you around.

348
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,430
这他妈怎么回事
The hell was that?

349
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,550
你不是说了这里没有熟人吗
I thought you said you don't know anybody around here?

350
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,110
我跟他不怎么熟
I barely know him.

351
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,710
什么叫不怎么熟
How do you barely know him?

352
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,830
我们一起坐过牢
We served time together.

353
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,990
什么
What?

354
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,830
你不是说自己没有前科吗
I thought you said you didn't have any priors.

355
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,110
这他妈什么情况
What the hell is your deal?

356
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,390
你本来打算什么时候告诉我们
When were you gonna tell us that?

357
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,990
冷静
Calm down.

358
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,110
很久以前的事儿  都不能算了
It's so long ago, it doesn't really count.

359
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,910
已经完结了  都被销案了
It's gone, expunged.

360
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,670
你朋友可真是个人物
Your friend is really something here,

361
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,830
艾德先生  或者说哈蒙
Mr. Ed-- or is it Harmon?

362
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,590
事情本来就已经有点复杂了
Things are kind of getting mixed up already,

363
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,750
我们只剩不到一个小时
and we're, what, an hour in?

364
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,470
你以为你的记录销了吗
You think your record is gone?

365
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,070
你以为记录真的会消失吗
You think anything is ever gone anymore?

366
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,670
跟上时代吧  老兄
You need to join this century, dude,

367
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,190
要知道你的案底并不只是
and realize that your record is not just sitting

368
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,390
被堆在某个档案柜里
in some filing cabinet somewhere.

369
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,510
他们不会销毁的  一切都会记录在案
They don't just burn it. Nothing is ever gone anymore.

370
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,510
你得认清这点
You need to know that.

371
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,030
放轻松点  这不是什么大事儿
Just take it easy, because it's not that big a deal.

372
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,030
这是一件大事
It is a big deal.

373
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,390
我觉得我们都得认清状况
I think we all should know what we're dealing with here.

374
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,150
能请你闭嘴吗
Oh, could you please shut up?

375
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,580
-好吧  -好的
- Okay. - Okay.

376
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,990
好了
All right.

377
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,910
记住  尽可能不要引人注意
Now remember, just be as forgettable as possible, all right?

378
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,830
摄像头在商店边儿上
The cameras are on the edges of the store,

379
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,630
所以尽量待在中间的货架那里
so stay to the middle aisle as much as possible.

380
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,350
别把帽子摘掉  好吗
Keep your hat on, okay?

381
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,670
记住  四万平方米  好吗
Hey, hey, remember, ten acres, okay?

382
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,460
你有四万平方米的土地
You got ten acres of land.

383
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,230
我在找大包装的那种
Hey, I'm looking for your larger bags?

384
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,310
22公斤袋装的
Your 50-pound bags?

385
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,710
那些在外面
Oh, they're outside,

386
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,670
从那个门出去的棚子里
out that door and over in the shed.

387
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,590
谢谢
Cool, thanks.

388
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,430
她还在马尼拉的时候
When she was in-- in Manila,

389
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,070
跟十个姐妹住同一间屋子
she shared a room with ten sisters,

390
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,310
过来以后
and she gets here.

391
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,710
她打量着房子
She looks at the house,

392
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,950
竟然说  这房子太小了
and she says, "The house is too small."

393
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,630
好了  再见  古斯
All right, hasta luego, all right, Goose?

394
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,100
好  日安
All right. Have a good day.

395
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,710
有什么能帮你的吗
Can I help you?

396
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,190
是的
Yeah.

397
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,750
我在找硝酸铵化肥
I'm looking for ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

398
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,990
你们有吗
Do you have that?

399
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,630
你都找过了吗
Did you look around?

400
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,630
稍微看了看
A little.

401
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,070
是吗
Yeah?

402
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,310
不  我们这儿没有
Nope, we don't have it.

403
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,870
一点都没有吗
None at all?

404
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,590
你可以去问问前台
Well, you can-- you can ask in the front office.

405
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,710
前台在哪里
Where's that?

406
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,870
在那个活动房屋里
In the trailer.

407
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,580
谢谢
Thanks.

408
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,310
有什么能帮你的吗
Can I help you?

409
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,430
是的
Yeah, I think so.

410
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,790
我想买点化肥
Looking to get some fertilizer.

411
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,390
有指定种类吗
Sure, you know what you're looking for?

412
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,830
是的  硝酸铵
Yeah, the ammonium nitrate.

413
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,830
希望你们这里有
Hope you've got it.

414
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,260
你要多少
How much you need?

415
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,750
220公斤
500 pounds.

416
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,070
如果你不介意的话
What are you growing with that,

417
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,710
能问一下要用来种什么吗
if you don't mind my asking?

418
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,830
甜菜  胡萝卜  洋葱
Oh, beets, carrots, onions,

419
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,950
欧洲萝卜  西兰花
parsnips, broccoli.

420
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,550
你用过我们的钠肥吗
I wonder if you've tried our new sodium fertilizer?

421
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,710
报告显示效果良好
It's good stuff by all reports,

422
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,870
吸收很快  跟铵肥效果一样
fast uptake, just like ammonium.

423
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,150
我觉得还是买我们用习惯了的吧
Yeah, I think I'll probably stick with what we're used to.

424
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,390
-不过谢谢你  -好吧
- Thank you, though. - All right.

425
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,710
你刚刚说要多少来着
How much you say you need?

426
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,430
220公斤
500 pounds.

427
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,790
土地面积多大呢
And how many acres you covering?

428
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,830
四万平方米
Ten.

429
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,150
好了
All right.

430
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,670
我需要你的签名和身份证
I need your signature, your ID...

431
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,590
拿出来了
Coming up.

432
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,150
没问题
Yep, no problem.

433
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,070
还有你的社保卡
And your Social Security card.

434
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,630
我没带
I don't think I have that.

435
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,670
我一般不带那个出门
I don't usually carry that around with me.

436
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,270
在卖硝酸铵给你之前
Well, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need to see

437
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,830
我必须得看看
your Social Security card

438
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,910
你的社保卡  知道吗
before I sell you ammonium nitrate, you understand?

439
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,630
我能告诉你号码  这不是问题
I could tell you the number, no problem.

440
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,830
不  我必须得亲眼看到
No, I'm gonna need to see it--

441
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,750
这是受管制物品
controlled substance and all.

442
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,950
那好吧
Okay. All right.

443
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,590
让我去卡车里找一下
Well, let me-- let me go check in my truck.

444
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,260
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

445
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,790
什么情况
What's up?

446
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,990
他要看社保卡
He wants a Social Security card.

447
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,110
什么
What?

448
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,230
胡扯
Bullshit.

449
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,350
完全就是胡扯  根本是故意刁难你
Complete and utter bullshit. Just a power trip.

450
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,790
他完全是骗你
He's making shit up.

451
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,790
谁会拿着社保卡满街跑
Who carries around their Social Security card?

452
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,510
我是这么说的  不过我说先在车上看看
That's what I said, but I told him I'd check in the car.

453
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,670
我们走吧  换个地方
All right, let's just go. Come on. We'll find it someplace else.

454
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,790
不不不
No, no, no, no.

455
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,830
-你是说换个地方吗  -对
- Just split you mean? - Yeah.

456
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,510
怎么  你不同意
What, you don't think so?

457
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,950
我觉得这是最容易
I'm just thinking that's the easiest way

458
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,910
被这里的人记住的方法
to get remembered out here, right?

459
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,310
我觉得你可能得回去
You probably ought to go back in there, I'd say.

460
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,070
不不不
No, no, no, no.

461
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,910
回去  告诉他你的卡放在家里了
Just go back in, tell him you left your card at home.

462
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,470
看看他怎么说
See what happens.

463
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,990
最坏的情况就是他不卖
Worst case is, he doesn't make the sale,

464
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,750
可你不能就这么不管他了
but you can't just leave him hanging, right?

465
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,620
去吧
Go on.

466
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,110
我没带社保卡
Yeah, I don't have that with me.

467
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,150
我一般不会随身带着
I don't carry that around on me usually.

468
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,950
这就不大方便了
Well, that's inconvenient.

469
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,310
对啊
Yeah, it is.

470
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,750
我甚至都不知道自己放哪儿了
I don't even really know where it is,

471
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,830
可是我需要买化肥
but I really do need that load.

472
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,230
有什么别的办法没有
So I don't know if there's something we can work out,

473
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,670
能不能跳过这一步
or some way to get around this.

474
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,790
你可以回家
Well, you could go home,

475
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,670
仔细找一下再回来  我们开到五点
take a look, come back later. We're open till 5:00.

476
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,310
是吗
Yeah.

477
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,070
我们住在松树洞那边
We're up near Pine Hollow,

478
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,190
得等到下周才能来了
so I wouldn't be able to get back for another week.

479
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,310
我也想帮你
Well, I wish I could help.

480
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,670
没有卡的话我今天最多能买多少
Well, how much can I get today without the card?

481
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,750
买不了
None.

482
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,670
我不能留点什么作抵押吗
I can't leave you some collateral or something?

483
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,780
不好意思
I'm afraid not.

484
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,550
先生  今年的冬天特别长
Look, sir, the winter went extra long this year,

485
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,590
所以我们现在施肥已经很晚了
so we're already late getting that stuff on the ground,

486
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,190
西兰花非常需要上肥
and the broccoli really needs it now,

487
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,310
不然没办法按时收获
or it's not gonna be ready in time.

488
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,740
我真的很抱歉
Well, I'm real sorry.

489
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,350
饲料对我们来说也很重要
The forage production is a big deal for us too.

490
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,310
我们有120头牛  需要草料和苜蓿
We've got a 120 milk cows that need that grass and clover.

491
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,110
只要你能带上我们要求的身份证明回来
Look, you come back here with the proper identification.

492
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,790
我们就能卖给你
I'm sure we can work something out.

493
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,390
可在那之前  我没法帮你
But until then, I can't help you.

494
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,110
不好意思  这是规定
I'm sorry. That's just how it is.

495
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,510
如果我长得像这些人你就会卖给我了吗
You'd sell it to me if I looked like these guys.

496
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,750
我认识这些人
I know these guys.

497
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,030
幸好你长得不像我们
Lucky you don't look like us.

498
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,830
好吧  先生
All right, look, sir.

499
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,510
如果你想  你可以打给我叔叔
If you want to, you can call my uncle.

500
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,790
我们的名字是丰收自然
Nature's Harvest is our name.

501
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,870
我们种植胡萝卜  洋葱  甜菜
We grow carrots, onions, beets,

502
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,950
欧洲萝卜  西兰花
parsnips, broccoli,

503
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,470
我们还有120头牛为威尔伯乳业供货
and we have 120 milk cows that supply for Wilber Dairy.

504
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,190
你们说不定喝过我们产的奶
You probably drink our milk.

505
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,670
我确实喝这个牌子
I do drink the milk

506
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,910
如果打折的话
if it's on sale.

507
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,910
你能到那边抓着绳子吗
You want to go around and grab this?

508
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,580
当然
Sure.

509
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,540
-你可以吗  -可以
- Got that? - Yeah.

510
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,870
所以
So...

511
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,390
我觉得我们应该从上游下水
I'm thinking we'll put in upstream all ways.

512
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,190
最近的地方是林间湖
Closest place is Lake of the Woods,

513
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,390
这个时节不会有什么人
not too many spectators this time of year.

514
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,950
好  在上游多远
Yep. How far upstream?

515
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,750
船坞离水库大概有
Uh, the boat launch is six or seven clicks

516
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,150
六七公里
from the reservoir.

517
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,230
我们先把船放下
We'll put the boat down first,

518
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,910
然后把卡车开下山
then take the truck further down the mountain.

519
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,150
好  听起来不错
All right, that sounds good.

520
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,390
你能弄好这些吗
You good with this?

521
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
可以  没问题
Yeah. I'm good.

522
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,590
慢点
Easy.

523
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,020
东西很重
Heavy load.

524
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,950
跟我走就行
You want to just follow me?

525
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,470
等等  你不是说没人会来吗
Wait, I thought you said no one would be here?

526
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,110
这不算什么
This is nothing.

527
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,670
你见识过旺季就知道了
You should see it in the on-season.

528
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,550
好吧
All right.

529
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,590
来吧  跟我来
Come on. Follow me.

530
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,260
好
All right.

531
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,790
你差一点就猜准了
You're almost right dead in the middle,

532
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,230
只比价格范围的正中低一点点
just a little below the very center of the price range.

533
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,510
来看看你能否能赢得五天六晚迈阿密之旅
Let's see if you are on your way to Miami for six nights.

534
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,470
她猜对了吗
Is she right?

535
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,470
你猜对了
You got it!

536
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,510
你能去迈阿密了  你能去迈阿密了
You're going to Miami! You're going to Miami!

537
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,110
我已经走了差不多18公里了
I've been walking for, like, 11 miles.

538
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,590
我走不动了
I can't go any more.

539
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,020
我的脚脖子要断了
My ankles are breaking.

540
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,710
我们很快
We'll be fast.

541
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,950
先找个安全的地方停拖车
Let's find a safe place to park the trailer, all right?

542
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,070
找停车地方的时候小心点
And careful where you park.

543
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,230
停车场有监控的
The lot has cameras now, okay?

544
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,390
知道了
Got it.

545
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,070
我们现在要做什么
Now what should we do?

546
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,470
那是个大家伙
That's a big guy.

547
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,070
我要射它吗
Should I shoot that?

548
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,830
砰
Bam!

549
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,070
他的胳膊断了
That guy has a broken arm.

550
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,670
那个家伙有胳膊
That guy has arms.

551
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,310
我们射它的胳膊
Let's shoot his arms!

552
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,070
砰  砰
Boom, Boom.

553
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,110
你要走哪条路回去
Which way are you going back?

554
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,870
26号公路  沿着山走
Uh, 26, across the mountain.

555
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,670
有点绕路  但是车流更多
It's out of the way, but there's more traffic.

556
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,310
我们可以藏进去
We can blend in.

557
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,270
我们分开以后最好不要再打电话
When we split up, we shouldn't talk on the phone.

558
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,510
对  不可以
Yeah, no way.

559
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,590
对  不联络  禁止联络
Yeah, no contact. No contact.

560
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,790
-不联络  -没错
- No contact. - Yeah.

561
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,140
-你们好  -靠
- Howdy. - Oh, shit.

562
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,110
你们今天怎么样
How are you guys doing today?

563
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,470
还不错
Not bad.

564
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,900
天气真好
Beautiful day.

565
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,910
不用管我  我只是出来走走
Don't mind me. I'm just out walking around.

566
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,190
必须一直走来走去才行
Got to keep walking all the time.

567
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,030
我的腿疼死了
My legs are killing me.

568
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,270
神经全部搭错线了
Nerves are messed up.

569
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,550
说起来裹脚布那么长
You don't want to hear about it.

570
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,030
不过  你们真会找好地方
Anyway, awesome spot you found.

571
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,350
对啊
Yep.

572
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,670
这里被重建得很好
Yeah, they fixed it up real nice.

573
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,390
80年代时我常到这里来
Oh, yeah, I used to come here back in the '80s.

574
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,910
80年代
Back in the '80s--

575
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,110
那是个疯狂的年代
man, those were wild times...

576
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,220
疯狂的年代
wild times.

577
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,580
保重
Take care.

578
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,670
这个湖有多深
How deep is this lake anyway?

579
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,310
这个季节大概有60米
Uh, 200 feet this time of year.

580
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,990
湖里有什么鱼
What kind of fish are in it?

581
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,710
主要是切喉鱒
Cutthroat trout, mainly.

582
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,630
我就见过这一种
It's all I've ever seen.

583
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,950
这是种油性鱼
That's an oily fish.

584
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,190
鳟鱼含有优质欧米茄三脂肪酸
Good omega-3 fatty acids in trout,

585
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,350
有益心脏
good for the heart.

586
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,790
据说还能抗抑郁
Good for depression too, they say.

587
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,390
我只知道钓这种鱼很好玩
All I know is, they're fun to catch.

588
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,550
怎么个好玩法
What makes them fun?

589
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,830
它们喜欢反抗  跳跃
They like to fight, they like to jump.

590
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,270
有时候能成功挣脱
Sometimes they break free,

591
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,150
是种令人敬佩的鱼
and I respect that in a fish.

592
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,270
我从来没钓过鱼
I've never fished.

593
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,150
不是吧  一次也没有
No, never? Not once?

594
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,230
-没有  -一 次 也 没 有
- Nope. - Not one time?

595
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,070
没有
Nope.

596
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,070
我小时候看过很多鱼的油画
Saw a lot of paintings of fish when I was a kid.

597
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,870
那是我们的家庭假期
Those were our family vacations,

598
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,430
通过欣赏画作来逃避现实
just looking at paintings of places we'd rather be.

599
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,190
总有一天你会去钓鱼的
Someday you'll fish.

600
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,710
不会的
No.

601
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,470
我现在不想钓鱼
I'm not fishing now.

602
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,670
2048年  海洋生物将完全灭绝
In 2048, the oceans are gonna be empty.

603
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,990
是吗  谁说的
Yeah? Who says?

604
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,190
科学
Science.

605
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,270
科学  也许科学错了
Science? Maybe science is wrong.

606
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,030
不会的
No.

607
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,110
29%的可食用鱼类数量下降了九成
29% of edible fish have gone down by 90%.

608
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,910
沿海人口的上涨
More people are moving to the coastlines,

609
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,350
意味着更多污染与垃圾
means more pollution, more waste.

610
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,310
情况会成几何级数地恶化
Situation is getting "geometically" worse.

611
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,710
最后一切都结束得很快
It'll all go fast in the end.

612
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,990
海洋丧失生物多样性后  一切随之消逝
Once the marine biodiversity goes, everything goes with it.

613
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,510
你知道得挺多
You know a lot.

614
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,390
大学时听过的唯一一门好课
The one good class I took in college.

615
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,990
是吗  没别的了吗
Really? That's it?

616
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,470
那真是太遗憾了
I hate to hear that.

617
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,150
我大学没读多久
I wasn't there very long.

618
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,470
四年培养出一群装逼佬
Just a bunch of poseurs shooting up for four years

619
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,070
毕业后到纽约从事媒体工作
before they took their media jobs in New York.

620
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,110
简直是个笑话  我迫不及待想离开那里
It was a joke. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

621
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,350
你应该趁一切消逝前去钓鱼
You should go fishing some time before it's all gone.

622
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,830
那个位置不妙啊
That's not a good spot.

623
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,470
确实
No.

624
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,740
我的车爆胎了
Yeah, I got a flat.

625
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,580
我想我需要你帮忙
Yeah, well you know, I'm gonna need your help.

626
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,190
是  是  我有
Yeah, yeah, I got--

627
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,230
不  我有  对  这个
no, I got-- yeah, this--

628
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,870
就在这里
yeah, it's right here.

629
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,790
对  我确实有千斤顶
Yes, I do have a jack.

630
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,310
宝贝  真希望你能看到
Babe, I wish you could see this.

631
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,580
我现在是多么威武雄壮
I'm looking pretty manly right now.

632
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,790
车已经被抬起来了
Okay, car is in the air.

633
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,590
我需要抬多高
How far am I going with this?

634
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,870
-你可以暂停倒计时吗  -好吧
- Can you stop it? - Okay.

635
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,300
不是个好主意
Not a great idea.

636
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,430
我们可以走了
Hey, we're good.

637
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,750
靠
Shit.

638
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,140
好  很好
Okay. Okay.

639
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,150
再会  兄弟
Later, brother.

640
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,820
再见  迪
See you, D!

641
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,030
好的
Okay.

642
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,670
现在我们只需要回家
We just got to get home,

643
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,870
明天一早去工作
show up for work tomorrow morning,

644
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,220
一切照常  好吗
just get back to normal, okay?

645
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,910
你在听我说吗
Hey, are you listening to me?

646
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,910
在啊
Uh, yeah.

647
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,580
很好
Okay.

648
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,220
靠
Shit.

649
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,030
把安全带系上
Put your seat belt on.

650
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,190
晚上好  我是塔兰特警察局的
Good evening, I'm Sergeant Snook

651
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,670
斯努克警官
with the Talent Police Department.

652
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,270
我们现在在检查这片区域
We're just checking the area right now,

653
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,910
清查来往人员的证件
identifying everybody coming through.

654
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,510
我需要看一下你的驾照
I need to see your license.

655
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,780
没问题
Yeah, of course.

656
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,110
你们今晚过得怎么样
How are you guys doing tonight?

657
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,750
我们挺好的
Oh, we're doing good.

658
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,150
好  你的乘客呢
Good. How about your passenger?

659
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,780
我也需要看你的证件
I need to see some ID for you.

660
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,190
{\an1}{\pos(178.5,230)}约瑟夫·玛卡
俄勒冈州尤金市
茵维尔街25号

661
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,710
约瑟夫  麻烦你下车  可以吗
Joseph, would you mind stepping out of the vehicle for me?

662
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,190
我想在这里问你一些问题
I'd just like to talk to you over here.

663
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,860
好
Yeah.

664
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,670
麻烦你掀开这块防水布好吗
Why don't you lift up this tarp here?

665
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,470
我需要检查它底下放了什么
I need to see what's underneath there.

666
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,710
你能掀开它吗
Can you lift that up for me?

667
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,420
好
Yeah.

668
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,430
那个箱子呢
How about the box?

669
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,830
可以把箱子滑过来吗
Could you slide the box over here?

670
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,790
你能让我看看箱子里面吗
Do you mind if I take a look inside?

671
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,030
你介意我看一下箱子内容吗
Do you mind if I look inside?

672
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,700
不介意
No.

673
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,590
这是个社区农业箱
That's just, like-- a CSA box.

674
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,950
农产品直销本地社区
It's, like, community supported agriculture

675
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,430
送货上门  全是蔬菜
for home delivery, just vegetables.

676
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,910
好  约瑟夫
Okay, Joseph.

677
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,390
你有没有发现任何形迹可疑的
You didn't see anything coming through, did you,

678
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,470
反常的事情呢
that looked out of the ordinary to you?

679
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,830
-没有  -没有  好
- No. - No, okay.

680
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,270
这是你们的证件
Here's your guys' IDs back.

682
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,430
晚安
Good evening.

683
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,150
你好
Hi.

684
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,740
我是塔兰特警察局的斯努克警官
I'm Sergeant Snook with the Talent Police Department.

685
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,710
就你那组织能力根本不能
You wouldn't have the organization skills

686
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,310
策划完成这样的行动
to pull off something like that.

687
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,110
你的审问能力也不怎么样
You don't have good interrogation skills.

688
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,630
很明显  这些人还是有点组织能力的
Well, clearly, these people have some organizational skills.

689
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,030
-早上好  -早
- Good morning. - Hey.

690
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,470
我以为你还没回来呢
I didn't know you were back already.

691
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,190
我夜里到的
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got in late.

692
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,390
那份上面没有当地新闻
Nothing local on there, you know.

693
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,590
如果你想知道比佛利山庄的人都在干什么
Unless you want to see what's happening in Beverly Hills

694
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,110
那还能看看
every five seconds of the day, then cool.

695
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,670
如果要知道家门口的河里发生了什么
But if you want to see what's happening

696
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,260
对不起  没有
in your own river, sorry.

697
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,550
怎么了
What's going on?

698
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,630
昨天晚上有人炸了格林彼得大坝
Somebody blew up the Green Peter Dam last night.

699
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,270
大事件  全国性新闻
Big story, national news.

700
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,630
有个人在下游
And this guy was downriver,

701
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,150
睡在河岸边
sleeping on the bank.

702
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,950
现在失踪了
Now they can't find him.

703
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,710
我再也不要去露营了
I am never going camping again,

704
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,270
除非是去山上
well, unless I'm uphill.

705
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,270
天  这家伙真倒霉
God, what a bummer.

706
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,630
你能想象吗
Can you imagine that?

707
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,950
就像是"兄弟  不要打鼾了"
It's like, "Dude, quit snoring."

708
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,350
"等等"
"Wait a minute."

709
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,870
"一大波湖水正在靠近"
"There's an entire lake coming for us."

710
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,470
-"我靠"  -一点都不好笑  迪伦
- "Holy shit!" - That's so funny, Dylan.

711
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,910
你真是毫无同情心
You have, like, no feelings at all.

712
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,310
不好意思呢
Oh, I'm sorry that my sympathy's

713
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,590
我支持炸掉大坝
with the water on this one.

714
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,870
好吧  你真是疯了
Wow, okay. Now you're insane.

715
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,510
不是啊  拜托
No, come on.

716
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,590
当然  如果那家伙真出事了
Like, of course, if something happened to that guy,

717
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,870
那真是太惨了
that's awful.

718
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,110
我希望他们能找到他  真的
I hope they find him. I do.

719
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,870
我只是想说
I'm just saying...

720
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,750
总要有人先开始做点什么
someone's got to start somewhere, you know?

721
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,030
真的
Seriously.

722
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,550
怎么  肖恩  你不同意
What, Sean, you don't agree?

723
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,150
确实  他们是群白痴  仅此而已
No, they're idiots, that's all.

724
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,110
对  但你不觉得他们挺有道理的吗
Yeah, but you don't think they had a point?

725
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,910
是啊  他们当然有很好的理由
Yeah, sure, they had a fine point.

726
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,350
但一座大坝  谁会在意呢
But one dam? Who cares?

727
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,110
那条河上建了十座大坝
That river has ten dams on it.

728
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,750
到处都有供电网
The grid is everywhere.

729
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,070
至少需要炸掉差不多12座
You need to take down, like,

730
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,270
100座大坝才会有影响
12 dams to make a difference, 100.

731
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,510
一座根本不算什么
Doesn't do anything.

732
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,950
怎么  你想要一座核电站
And, what, you want a nuke plant?

733
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,310
因为说到底这是唯一一个其他的选择
Because that's your only other option when you get down to it.

734
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,470
不  我是说希望每个人都能节约点
No, no. I'm just saying I want everyone to use less.

735
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,070
难道这样很难做到吗  至少这是件大事
I mean, is that so much to ask? I mean, it's something, you know?

736
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,670
没错  这确实是一项宣言
Yeah, it's a statement, right.

737
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,150
但我对宣言不感兴趣  我要的是结果
I'm not interested in statements. I'm interested in results.

738
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,030
拜托  你觉得这不是一种结果吗
Seriously, you don't call that results?

739
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,150
不  这叫吸引眼球
No, I call that theater.

740
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,390
好吧  那你有什么解决方法
All right, well, what's your solution?

741
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,990
看看窗外
Look out the window.

742
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,510
这样很慢  但我觉得有意义多了
It's a lot slower, but it makes a lot more sense to me.

743
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,310
你玩得开心吗
You have a good time?

744
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,830
那是波特兰
It was Portland.

745
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,270
看上去你玩得很开心
It looks like you had a good time.

746
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,070
我只是有点累
I'm just-- I'm tired.

747
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,190
你住在哪里
Where'd you stay?

748
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,550
我住朋友家  他刚搬到市里
I stayed at this friend's house. The guy just moved to town.

749
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,580
快点  你们两个  今天有大规模生产
Come on, you two, we start mass today.

750
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,630
不
Oh, no!

751
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,350
差点没了
Almost lost it.

752
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,830
好啦
There we go.

753
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,260
很好
Okay, that's good.

754
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,270
我感觉到什么了
I feel something.

755
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,550
看看
Look at that!

756
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,550
妈妈  看我的灵气
Mom, look at my aura!

757
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,550
很美
Beautiful. Okay.

758
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,550
我也要试试看
I want to try that!

759
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,710
好的  等我一下
Okay, give me a second.

760
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,070
这说明他有精神力量
Yeah, that means he's spiritual.

761
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,310
菲利斯
Hey, Felix!

762
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,670
不  你的灵气下降了
No, your aura level just went down.

763
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,870
放手  放手
Let go, let go.

764
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,430
乔希
Hey, Josh.

765
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,710
你想让我测你的灵气颜色吗
You want me to read your aura?

766
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,030
真的有用
It works.

767
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,910
好吧
Okay.

768
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,630
-你看过这个吗  -嗨  柯尔瑟
- Have you seen this thing? - Hey, Corser.

769
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,310
-这是什么  -我的灵气测试仪
- What is it? - It's my aura reader.

770
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,670
我测过  纯黑色
Oh, I've seen it. It's all black.

771
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,750
-好吧  -不好意思
- Yeah, okay. - Sorry.

772
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,150
是时候看看你们的真面目了
Now it's time to see who you people really are.

773
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,710
乔希
Hey, Josh.

774
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,550
柯尔瑟
Hey, Corser.

775
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,270
你好吗  哥们
What's up, man?

776
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,710
一般吧  你呢
Not much. You?

777
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,230
我把奶酪生产执照给烧了
Well, I burned my cheese license.

778
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,110
我听说了
I heard about that.

779
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,550
有什么负面影响吗
Was there any fallout?

780
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,150
一点都没有
Not a peep.

781
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,990
食品药监局已经知道了
I know the FDA Knows, by now...

782
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,540
但我还没收到任何通知
but I haven't heard a word.

783
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,190
你觉得接下来会怎样
So what do you think will happen?

784
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,340
不知道
No idea.

785
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,900
靠
Shit.

786
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,980
我能不能
Uh, could--

787
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,750
你好
Hello?

788
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,750
是我
It's me.

789
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,390
怎么了
What's up?

790
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,630
你有联系迪娜吗
Have you talked to Dena?

791
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,230
没有
No.

792
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,950
我以为我们现在不应该联系
No, I thought we weren't talking right now.

793
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,510
是啊  我也以为是这样
Yeah, well that's what I thought too,

794
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,420
可是她一直给我打电话
but she's been calling me a lot.

795
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,870
她为什么打给你
Why is she calling you?

796
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,590
不知道  但她确实找我了
I don't know, but she is.

797
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,870
她听起来不太好
And she doesn't seem like she's doing so good.

798
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,710
好吧  但我们不应该互相联络
Okay, but no one should be talking.

799
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,110
我们现在都不应该通电话
We-- we shouldn't even be talking right now.

800
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,870
我知道
Yep, I know,

801
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,350
但我们已经在通电话了
but it's happening.

802
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,590
你说她不太好是什么意思
So what do you mean, she's not doing so good?

803
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,270
你看新闻了吗
You read the news?

804
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,510
看了
Yeah.

805
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,470
她很难过
She's upset.

806
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,860
好吧  我也是
Yeah, well, me too.

807
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,670
他会出现的
He'll turn up.

808
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,180
你等着吧
You watch.

809
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,670
你觉得她应该不会
Well, you don't think she would,

810
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,790
做什么蠢事吧  会吗
like, do anything stupid, do you?

811
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,790
我不知道  所以我才打给你
I don't know. That's why I'm calling you.

812
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,910
好吧  这样
Okay, so...

813
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,310
也许我应该和她谈谈
so maybe I should go talk to her.

814
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,350
-也许吧  -好
- Yeah, maybe. - Yeah.

815
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,130
怎么了  你觉得我不应该这么做
What, you don't think I should?

816
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,550
我不知道  我不知道你们俩关系如何
I don't know. I don't know how it is between you two.

817
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,230
如果你觉得有用  那就打给她
If you think it would help, you should definitely talk to her.

818
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,510
如果没用  我也不知道了
If not, I don't know.

819
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,230
我就是想告诉你一声
I just wanted you to know.

820
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,470
就这样
That's all.

821
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,710
她好像不太好
She isn't doing that great.

822
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,990
好吧
Okay.

823
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,870
那你呢  你怎么样
So how-- how about you, though?

824
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,270
你还好吗
Are you-- are you okay?

825
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,510
我很好
I'm okay.

826
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,510
肯定的
Sure.

827
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,590
晚安
Good night.

828
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,300
晚安
Good night.

829
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,310
我以为我们要分开一段时间
I thought we were gonna stay away for a while.

830
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,310
我只是想来看看你
Yeah, I just wanted to check in.

831
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,860
上车吧
Come on in.

832
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,670
哈蒙给你打电话了  对吧
Harmon called you, didn't he?

833
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,470
对  我们谈了一下
Yeah. We talked for a second.

834
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,710
他说你很不安
He said that you were worried.

835
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,990
就这样
That's all.

836
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,310
不安
Worried.

837
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,990
你想谈谈吗
Do you want to talk about it?

838
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,390
你要我说什么
What am I supposed to say?

839
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,030
你看过那个网站吗
Have you seen the website?

840
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,390
什么网站
What website?

841
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,590
你当然没看过
Of course you haven't seen it.

842
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,310
你关心这个干嘛
Why would you care?

843
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,030
我不知道你说的是哪个网站
I don't know what website you're talking about.

844
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,590
为了失踪露营者的那个
The one for the missing camper.

845
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,870
你应该看看
You should see it.

846
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,350
他的妻子  孩子  妈妈以及朋友们
All of his friends are posting,

847
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,510
都在找他
his wife, his kids, his mother.

848
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,580
真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

849
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,350
听好
Okay, look.

850
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,070
谁都不想发生这事
It's not what anyone wanted,

851
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,550
也许那个人没事
but the guy is probably fine.

852
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,750
我们什么也不知道
We don't know anything.

853
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,710
你说过  没人会受伤的
You said no one would get hurt.

854
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,990
他们却成了受害者
But they did.

855
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,910
我们还不知道  但是
We don't know that, but...

856
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,150
但是你感到不安是正常的
but it's natural for you to feel so upset.

857
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,510
这一点都不正常
There's nothing natural about this.

858
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,870
我们可以在冬天的时候行动
We could have done this in the winter

859
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:58,990
那时候没人在那里
when no one would be there.

860
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,500
你以为会发生什么
What did you think was gonna happen?

861
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,590
所以
So...

862
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,710
你打算怎么办
so what are you gonna do?

863
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,990
什么意思
What do you mean?

864
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,630
我的意思是  你有什么打算吗
I mean, are you going to do anything?

865
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,390
或者你能挺过去
Or are you going to be able to get through this

866
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,470
继续生活吗
and keep on going?

867
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,710
这是你来这里的原因吗
Is that why you're here?

868
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,110
你是怕我报警吗
Do you mean, am I gonna call the cops?

869
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,590
是怕我去拜访哈尔特一家
Am I gonna go visit the Halter family

870
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,670
告诉他们真相吗
and tell them what really happened?

871
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,790
我不知道  别烦我
I don't really know, so just leave me alone.

872
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,550
迪娜
Hey, Dena.

873
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,180
放开我
Let me go.

874
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,070
你弄疼我了
You're hurting me.

875
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,230
对不起
Sorry.

876
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,710
一定是三文鱼干的
I bet the salmon did it.

877
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,190
自杀式三文鱼
Like, suicide salmon,

878
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,710
组织起来
they, like, organized,

879
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,070
从鲟鱼或其它鱼那弄来了武器
got arms from the sturgeon or something, you know?

880
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,190
你听说过延龄湖里的朝鲜蓟吗
Did you hear about those artichokes at Trillium?

881
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,750
它们非常美味  好吃极了
They're so good, man. They're amazing.

882
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,030
上周有试吃
They had some on samples for last week.

883
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,190
我听说了
Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.

884
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,910
我听说比去年的好
I heard they were better than last year's.

885
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,340
那是一定的
That's for sure.

886
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,110
我们十点才开门
We don't open until 10:00.

887
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,310
给我五分钟就好
I'll be.. I'll be five minutes... less.

888
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,630
如果我为你破例
If I make an exception for you...

889
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,190
我听不到你说什么
I can't hear you.

890
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,870
我就得为所有人破例
I have to make an exception for everyone.

891
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,190
给我两分钟就好  可以吗
Okay, I'll be two minutes, okay?

892
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,060
就两分钟
I'll be two minutes.

893
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:40,000
在格林彼得大坝附近发现失踪露营者尸体

894
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:53,140
{\pos(132.25,17.666)}删除浏览记录

895
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:53,180
{\pos(132.25,17.666)}删除浏览记录

896
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:53,890
{\pos(132.25,17.666)}删除浏览记录

897
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,710
再见
Bye.

898
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,140
回见  兄弟
Later, man.

899
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,150
你又跟迪娜谈过了吗
You talk to Dena again?

900
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,590
现在是怎样
And what's happening?

901
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,910
她快崩溃了
She's taking it hard.

902
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,670
我也差不多
Yeah, well, join the club.

903
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:39,670
她跟你可不一样
Yeah, well, there's hard, and there's hard.

904
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,550
所以
So...

905
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,670
她会告诉别人吗
is she talking?

906
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,100
时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

907
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,670
一个人
One person.

908
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,550
就牺牲一个人
Okay? That's all it takes.

909
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,700
所以呢
So?

910
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,910
我不知道
I don't know.

911
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,910
这件事得解决
Something's got to happen.

912
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,470
你有办法吗
Oh, you got ideas?

913
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,990
没有  不过我不想进监狱
Nope, but jail don't sound too good to me.

914
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
我还想活久点
The time for this try life plus 300 years.

915
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,980
该死
Shit.

916
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,390
你好  乔希
Hi, Josh.

917
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,470
你好  最近怎样
Hey. How's it going?

918
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,870
很好
Good.

919
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,670
你好  乔希
Hey, Josh.

920
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,070
走吧
Okay, let's go.

921
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,710
走吧  小东西
Come on, guys. Come on.

922
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,870
-快走  -快
- Hey, come on. - Come on.

923
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,310
-斯科特  快走  -斯科特
- Scout, let's go. - Scout.

924
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,740
斯科特  快走
Scout, let's go.

925
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,750
-跟上  -斯科特
- Hey. - Scout.

926
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,420
过来
Here.

927
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:13,150
乔希  我能和你谈谈吗
Hey, Josh, can I talk to you for a second?

928
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,550
现在吗
Now?

929
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,980
就是现在
Yeah, now would be good.

930
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,190
怎么了
What's up?

931
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:40,150
我也不知道发生什么事
Now, I don't know exactly what's going on.

932
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,510
你干什么是你自己的事
What you do is your own business,

933
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,870
但人们已经开始谈论了
but people are talking.

934
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,870
你知道吗
You know that?

935
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,470
谁在谈论
Who's talking?

936
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,990
直接告诉我
You know, just tell me.

937
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,750
谁在谈论
Tell me who's talking.

938
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,190
迪娜和安昨晚谈过了
Dena and Anne talked last night.

939
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,310
她说什么了
And what did she say?

940
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,110
我不知道
I don't know.

941
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,430
她什么也不用说
She didn't have to say anything.

942
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,190
安太了解她了
Anne knows her too well.

943
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,060
安又不傻
Anne's not stupid.

944
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,750
迪娜还和谁说了
And who else is Dena talking to?

945
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,190
这不是重点
That's not the point.

946
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,110
我什么也不知道  可以吧
Now, I don't know anything, all right?

947
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,230
可以
All right.

948
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,350
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

949
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,030
我也不需要知道
I don't ever have to know,

950
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,870
我更不想成为同谋
but I can't be an accomplice to this.

951
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,590
你不是  你什么也不知道
You're not. You don't even know anything.

952
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,190
你还是不懂  乔希  我们生活在这里
You're not getting it, Josh. We live here.

953
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,270
意味着我和我的家人都会受到牵连
That means I'm abetting. My whole family's abetting you.

954
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,150
你还不明白吗  我们可能会失去一切
Don't you get it, man? We could lose everything.

955
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,550
这事不会无缘无故平息
This is not gonna blow over, man.

956
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,230
做你该做的  把事情搞定
Do your thing, whatever you have to do,

957
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,510
千万别把我们拖下水
but don't take us down, all right?

958
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,900
你知道我们努力了多久才有这番景象吗
You know how long it took for us to make this?

959
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,150
乔希
Hey, Josh.

960
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,710
乔希
Josh.

961
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,420
怎么了
What's going on?

962
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,190
我听说你要离开这里
I hear you're taking off.

963
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,150
是的  至少离开一阵子
Oh, yeah, yeah, for a little while, at least.

964
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,390
现在吗
Right away?

965
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,510
你要
Are you...

966
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,870
你要去波特兰吗
are you gonna go up to Portland?

967
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,070
我想我可能很快也会去那里
'Cause I think I'm gonna be going up there soon actually.

968
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,310
不
Oh, no.

969
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,590
我往东部去  所以
I'm heading east, so...

970
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,590
-太可惜了  -抱歉
- Oh, bummer. - Sorry.

971
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,510
无论如何  是时候出去走走了
Well, it's a good time to be getting out, anyways.

972
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,350
为什么  你什么意思
Why? What do you mean?

973
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,950
你听说柯尔瑟的事了吗
Did you hear about Corser?

974
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,750
听说了
Well, yeah.

975
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,350
警察上门把他的电脑都收走了
The Feds knocked on his door and took away his computers.

976
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,110
为什么
Why?

977
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,430
说是因为他烧了生产执照
Burning the license, they said.

978
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,310
柯尔瑟说那都是胡扯
But Corser says that's bullshit, 

979
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:40,670
一定另有原因
that they're on to something.

980
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,630
真是想太多了  对吧
It's out of this world, right?

981
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,910
那他怎么办
So what did he do?

982
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,310
他把电脑给他们了
He gave them the computers.

983
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,270
那些可不是食品检测员
You know, this is not the food inspectors, man.

984
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,460
他不敢惹他们
He's not gonna mess with these guys.

985
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,110
惊喜  走了
Surprise, come on.

986
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,510
好的
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

987
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,060
我一会就过去
I'll meet up with you in a second.

988
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,060
就像远走高飞  对吧
God, it's like, "Go away," Right?

989
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,580
你最近跟迪娜联系过吗
So have you talked to Dena lately?

990
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,510
没有
No. No.

991
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,950
我也没有
Yeah, me neither.

992
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,630
-好久没见到她了  -是啊
- I haven't seen her in a while. - Yeah.

993
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,630
听说她好像有点情绪低落之类的
I heard she was kind of down or something.

994
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,710

Oh, yeah?

995
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:33,400
莎拉说的

996
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,710
我以为你知道些什么

997
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,500
我不知道
I don't.

998
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,750
那好吧
Okay, well...

999
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,910
如果你联系到她的话
if you talk to her,

1000
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,230
让她给我电话  好吗

1001
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,900

Hope you don't get in trouble for this.

1005
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,990

No, Audrey's cool.

1006
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,070

This play just takes it out of me.

1007
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,310
感觉好多了
I feel much better.

1008

1009
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,710
你得照顾好自己
You should really treat yourself too.

1010
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,550
只是荨麻疹之类的
Oh, it's just hives or a rash or something,

1011
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,950
我一有压力就会这样
whenever I'm stressed.

1012
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,470
好好照顾自己
Well, try to take care of yourself.

1013
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,750
如果这个周末有什么事  就给我电话
If anything happens this weekend, give me a call.

1014
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:27,180
再见
See you.

1015
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,260

1018
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:54,500
我只是想看看你还好不
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.

1019
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,830
因为我
Because I've been,

1020
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,550
个人感觉
personally,

1021
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,550
不太好
not so good.

1022
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,910
如果我感觉不太好
And if I'm not good,

1023
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,350
你也感觉不太好的话
and you're not good, then...

1024
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:14,150
-不  我很好  -不不不  我只是
- No, I'm fine. - No, no, no, I just...

1025
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:17,790
我觉得我们要了解自己的感受
I just think it's important that we know what we feel.

1026
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,750
我知道  我懂
Yeah, yeah, I get it. I got it.

1027
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,710
很好  那就别打电话
Good, okay, now stay off the fucking phone.

1028
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,590
别上网
Stay off the goddamn computer.

1029
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,350
给我闭嘴
Don't open your mouth at all.

1030
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,350
出去走走
Go somewhere else.

1031
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,550
有必要的话就离开这里
Get out of town if you have to.

1032
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,550
昨晚我去见她了
Yes, I went to see her last night.

1033
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,190
那里像是
And, yeah, there was kind of like...

1034
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,790
像是出了场意外
like an accident, and...

1035
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,990
你在说迪吗
Are you talking about D?

1036
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,150
你是说迪不会再碍事了吗
You're telling me D isn't in the picture anymore?

1037
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:08,110
就这样了吗  她真的出局了吗
Is that it? She... Did she quit on this?

1038
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,710
是的  她出局了
Yeah, she quit.

1039
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,030
什么也别告诉我  我不想知道
Don't tell me anything. I don't want to know.

1040
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,990
那只是个意外  我的意思是
Yeah, but, I mean, it was an accident, though. I mean, she...

1041
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,990
我知道  你冷静点
I know. I know man. Just calm down. I know.

1042
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,510
因为意外  她出局了
She quit by accident. Okay.

1043
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,790
我也不知道
I don't know.

1044
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,550
我在想  也许
Like, I was thinking, maybe, like,

1045
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,350
我们可以去个什么地方
you and I could go somewhere,

1046
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,990
安静点的
like, kind of quiet,

1047
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,030
去一个完全陌生的地方
like just out in the middle of nowhere or something.

1048
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,470
我东西很多
I got a lot of stuff.

1049
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:42,470
我可以去接你
And I could come and get you.

1050
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,510
我不知道你在哪  但我可以去接你
I can come and get you now. I don't know where you are.

1051
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,430
你得赶紧逃了
You got to get real lost now.

1052
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,870
赶紧逃  别回来
You got to get real lost and stay lost.

1053
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:51,470

Okay.

1054
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,990
