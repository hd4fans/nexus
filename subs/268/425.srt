1
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,387
<i>With every sun comes a new day.</i>

2
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,890
<i>A new beginning.</i>

3
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,594
<i>A hope that things will be better
today than they were yesterday.</i>

4
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:06,514
<i>But not for me.
My name's Eep.</i>

5
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,303
<i>And this is my family.
The Croods.</i>

6
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:11,807
<i>If you weren't clued already,
by animal skin</i>

7
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:14,459
<i>and sloping forehead,
we are cavemen.</i>

8
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,937
<i>Most days we spend in our cave.</i>

9
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:20,517
<i>In the dark.</i>

10
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:24,158
<i>Night after night, day after day.</i>

11
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:28,160
<i>Yep. Home sweet home.</i>

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,604
<i>When we did go out,
we struggled to find food</i>

13
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,529
<i>in a harsh and hostile world.</i>

14
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,844
<i>And I struggled to survive my family.</i>

15
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:41,583
<i>We were the last ones around.</i>

16
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,480
<i>There used to be neighbors.</i>

17
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,626
<i>The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.</i>

18
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,881
<i>The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.</i>

19
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,101
<i>The Erfs, mosquito bite.</i>

20
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:54,806
<i>The Throgs, common cold.</i>

21
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,848
<i>And the Croods.. That's us.</i>

22
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:01,289
<i>The Croods made it,
because of my dad.</i>

23
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,912
<i>He was strong,
and he followed the rules.</i>

24
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,936
<i>The ones painted on our cave walls:</i>

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,062
<i>Anything new is bad.
Curiosity is bad.</i>

26
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,742
<i>Going out at night is bad.</i>

27
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:14,183
<i>Basically, anything fun is bad.</i>

28
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,611
<i>Welcome to my world!</i>

29
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>But this is a story about how
all that changed in an instant.</i>

30
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,979
<i>Because what we didn't
know, was that our world</i>

31
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,430
<i>was about to come to an end.</i>

32
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>And there were no
rules on our cave walls</i>

33
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,465
<i>to prepare us for that.</i>

34
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,777
You're supposed to
wait for my signal, Eep.

35
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,981
Eep?

36
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,942
We've been in that cave forever.

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,772
Three days is not forever.

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,669
It is with this family.

39
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,472
Eep, will you come down here?

40
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:20,982
You're being so... so dramatic.

41
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,271
No, no, no, Sandy, come back here!

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,852
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal.

43
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,837
Ugga! / As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go
back in, and you can give the signal.

44
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,920
No. But you're already out now.

45
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,723
I am waiting for the signal, Dad!

46
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,422
Never mind, Thunk.
Just come out.

47
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:41,518
But if you don't give me the signal,
how do I know you're my dad?

48
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:45,696
The signal isn't so you know it's me. It's
so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.

49
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:48,385
Then why is the
signal an animal noise?

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,497
I mean, doesn't that
just confuse things?

51
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,156
I'm still waiting
for the signal.

52
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,562
Mom, we're ready to leave!

53
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,116
Mom?

54
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,145
Still alive!

55
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,171
It's still early.

56
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,119
And you're still fat.

57
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,800
Breakfast formation!

58
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,726
I want to see some real
caveman action out there!

59
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,935
We do this fast. We do this loud,

60
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:36,956
we do this as a family,

61
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:40,308
and never not be afraid!

62
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,612
Yay! Breakfast..

63
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:19,317
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.

64
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,411
- Call her in the air.
- Heads!

65
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,613
Tails. Thunk's in.
Positions!

66
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:29,872
Okay.
Thunk, go!

67
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,331
Come on, Thunk.

68
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,827
Way to go! Take it to the cave!

69
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,518
Release the baby!

70
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,915
Get 'em, Sandy, go!

71
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,123
Get them, Mom!

72
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,542
Old lady down!

73
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,123
Eep, avenge me!

74
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,743
Thanks.

75
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,697
- Eep!
- Heads up!

76
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,237
Hey, Dad, can we eat now?

77
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,581
Just wait til we get home.

78
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,704
Eep, put on the brakes!

79
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,310
Eep!

80
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,690
Who's hungry?

81
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,329
Good one, Dad.

82
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,132
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

83
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,042
- Sorry, dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight!

84
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,996
That's all right. I ate last week.

85
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,454
Two knuckle warning!

86
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,556
Go, go, go, go.

87
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:17,907
Come on, come on.

88
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,710
Darkness brings death.
We know this.

89
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,621
The moon is full.
Bath night.

90
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:25,824
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.

91
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,744
I don't want to lose
my protective layer.

92
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,555
Mom, you've got ants.

93
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,357
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

94
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:42,054
- Is she still out there?
- You know she hates the cave, Grug.

95
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,938
Please come back tomorrow.

96
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:13,788
How can she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.

97
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,485
It is a little dark, right?

98
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,585
It's not that dark.

99
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:21,871
Eep!
Eep?

100
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,628
Come on, I gotta close the cave.

101
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,584
Eep!

102
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:54,013
Okay! Okay!

103
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,267
Come on.

104
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:05,225
Eep! Come down!

105
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,728
- That was too close!
- I was watching. I was fine.

106
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,736
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.

107
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,438
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.

108
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,220
- Well then, why did you go up there?
- I don't know!

109
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,021
Why don't you know?

110
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:34,979
Stop looking for things!

111
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,862
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.

112
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,764
Never not be afraid.

113
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,541
What's the point of all this?

114
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,356
- What was that?
- I mean, why are we here?

115
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:46,520
What are we doing this for?

116
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:51,884
No one said survival is fun.

117
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,591
Nothing is fun.

118
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,264
- Would you come down here?
- Grug? - Eep? - Yes?

119
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,464
- Off! - Yes. Okay...
- Off!

120
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,757
I just don't see why she needs
her own ledge.

121
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,159
That's all. That's what this is about.

122
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,712
She's working through some things
and needs some her own space.

123
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:07,600
What things? How long
is this going to take?

124
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,926
Really? I mean, she already
doesn't listen to me. Hey!

125
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,251
See? She's listening.

126
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:15,073
If she wants to survive,
she has to follow our rules.

127
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:18,291
- How about a story? Eep loves those.
- That's a good idea.

128
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,975
- How about a story, huh?
- Yeah, tell us a story.

129
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,874
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

130
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,341
Eep! Your old favorite!

131
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,620
I haven't played with
that thing in years.

132
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:34,459
Tonight we'll hear the
story of Krispy Bear.

133
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:37,510
A long time ago, this
little bear was alive.

134
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,437
She was alive because
she listened to her father

135
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:44,392
and lived her life in routine
and darkness and terror.

136
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,344
So she was happy.

137
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:50,457
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

138
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
She was filled with...

139
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,528
..curiosity.

140
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,495
- Grug!
- Yes, yes.

141
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,247
And one day, while she was in a tree,

142
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:03,371
the curious little bear
wanted to climb to the top.

143
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,328
What? / And no sooner had she
climbed to the top,

144
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,331
she saw something new and..

145
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,770
- ..died!
- Just like that?

146
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:16,743
Yes! Her last moments of
terror still frozen on her face.

147
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,722
Same ending as every day.

148
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:21,531
I get it, Dad. I get it. I will
never do anything new or different.

149
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:22,524
Good man, Thunk.

150
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,225
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth

151
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,682
and let's pile up.

152
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:03,332
- Air..
- You talk?

153
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,822
I'm person, like you.

154
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,838
Sort of... like you.

155
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,642
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Could you, could you mind not..

156
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,728
That tickles.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

157
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,233
Quiet! I am not
supposed to be out here.

158
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,589
- Eep's gone.
- What? Grug!

159
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:45,713
Stay in the cave.

160
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,837
Wow, you're really strong.

161
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,375
- No! It's mine!
- Please.. - No! No!

162
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:07,408
- But it is dying! - I caught it.
- I can fix it. Please...

163
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:10,087
Please. I hate the dark.

164
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:21,950
Come on, come on...

165
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:26,228
It does what you tell it?

166
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,002
Well, yeah, sort of.

167
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:32,688
- Sun?
- No, no. Fire.

168
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:41,058
- Hi, Fire.
- It's not alive.

169
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,460
But you said it was dying.

170
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,452
- Sorry. Uh..
- It comes from where you came from?

171
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:51,152
- No. No, I make it.
- Make some for me.

172
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,226
- Okay! - Make! It doesn't
come out of me. - Make!

173
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,691
Make! Make it!

174
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,707
You do this a lot.

175
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:02,685
Are you dead?

176
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:05,287
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

177
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,525
Hey, those are cold!

178
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,528
You think?
Listening shells, activate.

179
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:19,679
I concur. Tiger girl, we
need to leave immediately.

180
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,207
I don't even know you.

181
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,038
- I'm Guy.
- Guy?

182
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,140
And this is Belt. Cook,
conversationalist, navigator.

183
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:31,567
Also keeps my pants up.

184
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,447
- What are 'pants up'?
- Who are you?

185
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:36,359
Eep.

186
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:38,661
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.

187
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:42,090
- What?
- I'm calling it... "The End."

188
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,285
- How do you know?
- I've seen it. It's coming this way.

189
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:50,767
First, the ground is gonna shake.
Then it breaks open.

190
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:52,224
Everything falls in.

191
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:55,080
Fire. Lava. I don't mean to
sound too dramatic, but...

192
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,593
Believe me, everything we're standing
on, all this right here, will be gone.

193
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,097
We've got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain.

194
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,392
That way.
It's our only chance.

195
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,481
Come with me.

196
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:13,791
- I can't.
- Okay. Okay.

197
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:16,858
Here.

198
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,035
If you survive, call me.

199
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,040
Thank you.

200
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:32,575
Hello?

201
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:35,086
Hey!

202
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,116
Dad!

203
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:39,078
Are you hurt?
What took you?

204
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,243
Nothing. I left on my own.

205
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:45,581
- You.. what?
- Dad, let me explain.

206
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:55,117
You never let me talk.

207
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:57,518
You're grounded.

208
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,712
- Eep!
- Mom!

209
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,093
Grug! What happened?

210
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,047
You know what, I am so mad right now
that I can't talk to her.

211
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,594
- Eep?
- You'll never believe it.

212
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:15,838
I found something new.

213
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,116
- New?
- New is a big problem.

214
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:21,127
Wait. Wait. / Eep, stay inside
the family kill circle.

215
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,274
- It wasn't bad.
- New is always bad.

216
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,683
- No. He was nice.
- What? Excuse me? He?

217
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,753
Well, I thought he was a warthog,

218
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:31,256
but then he turned into a boy.

219
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,918
Strange. Usually it’s the reverse.

220
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,666
Eep’s got a boy hog!
Eep’s got a boy...

221
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:40,578
There was a boy. Watch, okay?
I'm gonna call him.

222
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,345
What is wrong with you?

223
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,625
- It was dangerous.
- It was beautiful!

224
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:05,105
You want to see dangerous? Here!

225
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,617
- Ow! My sniffer!
- Okay, Eep, that’s it.

226
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:13,437
We’re going back to the cave and you’re going
to stay in there until you’re older than...

227
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:16,903
- You know.. her!
- What?

228
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,479
You can't keep me inside forever!

229
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,381
He said this would happen.

230
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:40,713
Get to the cave!

231
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,191
Go!

232
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:15,849
Look out!

233
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,555
Stop!

234
00:24:57,132 --> 00:24:59,773
- Is everyone okay?
- Yes.

235
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:05,035
Grug, the cave. It’s gone.

236
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,931
No..

237
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:48,114
You really need to see this.

238
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,850
- We should go there!
- No. No.

239
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,415
No one is going anywhere.

240
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,543
What else did that boy say?

241
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,276
Come on, Gran!

242
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:42,278
Just go. Go! Go!

243
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:06,567
One, two, three, four, five...

244
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:11,771
Six.

245
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,327
- Where are we?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

246
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:20,098
Down. In a lower place.

247
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:24,370
But, one thing’s for sure, we
can't go back the way we came.

248
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,413
Sandy? What is it?

249
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,468
No, no. Wait.
Come back, Sandy.

250
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:41,467
We can't be out in
the open like this.

251
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,384
We need a cave.

252
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,783
Now step where I step

253
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,634
Okay. Stay quiet.

254
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,102
Hopefully nothing big
knows we’re here yet.

255
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:06,154
Wait!
Okay.

256
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:09,182
Wait!
Okay.

257
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:11,565
Wait!

258
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:18,009
Wait!

259
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:22,438
Okay.
Wait!

260
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:28,555
<i>Wait!</i>

261
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:42,795
So Dad, just to be clear, are we
looking for the exact same cave?

262
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:47,549
Okay. If it was me... I was throwing this
out there. If it was me choosing the cave,

263
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,805
I would go with a smaller cave.

264
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,472
Wait!

265
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:02,743
- Dad?
- I’ll take care of this.

266
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:15,234
All right, Dad, get 'em!
Go get ’em!

267
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,702
Hah! I’m loving this.

268
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,890
Dad, I got this. Just stop
running to their fists!

269
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,418
Grug, when you’re done,
we should get going.

270
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,518
That’s right! You
can't get past this!

271
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,275
Climb! Climb! Climb!

272
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,083
Move!

273
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,332
Cave! Go! Go!

274
00:30:08,728 --> 00:30:11,068
Come on, hurry up!
Let’s go! Come on!

275
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:16,280
<i>Hey, look! This cave
has a tongue! Awesome!</i>

276
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:36,251
Okay. That's one, two,
three, four, five...

277
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:43,834
Six. / And seven, if we’re
counting Chunky the Death Cat.

278
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:56,063
He’s scared of the dark!

279
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:59,516
Wait, we’re scared of the dark.

280
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:38,089
Kill circle!

281
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:50,199
Eep!

282
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:11,985
Eep!

283
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:12,951
- Cavies!
- Cavies?

284
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,866
Cavemen! Stand back!
They’re practically animals.

285
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,400
- See their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah!

286
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:22,125
- The huge primitive teeth?
- Yeah?

287
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:24,566
The excessive body hair?

288
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,780
- That one’s even got a tail!
- Yeah.

289
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:29,660
All right. Close your eyes. I’m
going to have to take their lives.

290
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:32,592
No! It won't help.
They’re my family.

291
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,394
What?

292
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:39,630
- The sun is in his hands!
- No, no, it’s fire.

293
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:42,975
- Where did it come from?
- He made it.

294
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:45,248
- Make some for me!
- It doesn't come out of him.

295
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:47,628
Make! Make it!

296
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,605
You know, you’re a
lot like your daughter.

297
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:52,927
Oh, great, now he’s broken.

298
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,212
Oh, it’s a baby sun!

299
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:57,616
Whoa! Hey! Stay back!
We don't know what it wants.

300
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,977
Now we’ll all sit here and
wait for the sun to come back.

301
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,989
And tomorrow we’ll find a new cave

302
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,705
and pretend today never happened.

303
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:07,468
Isn't this fun, Eep?

304
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:10,166
Eep, don't touch him!
Goodness knows where he’s been.

305
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,132
Dad, Sandy’s hurting fire!

306
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,621
Sandy! No! Fire is not a plaything.

307
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,227
- What a cute little guy.
- Hey, stay back!

308
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,582
No, no, no, wait!

309
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:29,601
It likes me! Hey! It’s biting me!

310
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:33,975
Thunk! Try hiding from
it in the tall, dry grass!

311
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:41,559
Stop, please! I’m only nine!
It’s biting me!

312
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,688
Fire babies!

313
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:51,290
- Hi.
- So, your dad, he’s trying to kill me.

314
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,486
Yeah. But I won't let him.

315
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:56,817
Hold on, son, come back!

316
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:00,187
It won't stop.
Stop touching me!

317
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,668
Get out!

318
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,170
Eat up, babies!

319
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,675
Die!

320
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:14,709
I win!

321
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,765
They’re not so scary
once you get to know them.

322
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:30,455
- Who are you people?
- Oh, I’m sorry. We’re the Croods!

323
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,664
And you are?

324
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,819
- Uh, Guy?
- Hai, Guy.

325
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:52,438
Looks like magic!

326
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,672
And smells like food.

327
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,681
No, don't eat it, it's new!

328
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:08,987
Still alive!

329
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,363
<i>Come on, keep eating!</i>

330
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,518
Hey, where's Guy?

331
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:24,863
Going somewhere?

332
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:27,866
The Mountain. High ground.
End of the world, remember?

333
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,693
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.

334
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:33,311
No. That was just the beginning
of the end.

335
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,613
The end of the end is still coming.

336
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:38,205
Eep!
Drop it.

337
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,070
We can't let him go!

338
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:45,934
What if we don't find
a cave before sunset?

339
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:48,826
What if it takes a few days?

340
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:51,887
What if the birds come back?

341
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,688
We need his fire, dummy!

342
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:59,833
Fine. You’re staying with
us until we find a cave.

343
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,387
What? No, I’m not! Don't
make me part of this!

344
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,638
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

345
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:08,581
I’ve got a dream, a
mission, a reason to live!

346
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:09,820
Not anymore!

347
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:13,777
Umm, I’ve got an idea.
Let’s go to that Mountain!

348
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:18,632
- It's too far.
- Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

349
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:21,504
There are caves on that Mountain.

350
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:22,934
Have you been there?

351
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:26,728
It's a mountain. Mountains are
safe. Mountains have caves...

352
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:28,830
..water. Sticks.

353
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,610
Mom, did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!

354
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,454
Yes! Sticks. And caves. Caves and
sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go!

355
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,673
Quiet!

356
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:50,386
That thing is weird.

357
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:53,698
No. No. No. It's okay, Sandy.

358
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,815
That's just a belt.

359
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:03,620
I’ve made a decision. We’re
going to.. that mountain!

360
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:06,149
Don't ask me why.
It’s just a hunch.

361
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,861
- It just feels right.
- I don't know, Grug.

362
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:10,963
We’ve never really walked that far.

363
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,245
I don't think my feet can do that.

364
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,494
I’ll never live long
enough to get there.

365
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:18,899
Let's do it.

366
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:21,283
Oh, come on, just think.

367
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:25,352
Our whole family, packed together
on a long, slow trip across country?

368
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:27,348
Days and nights with just each other?

369
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,848
We’ll tell stories. We’ll laugh.

370
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,759
We’ll become closer as a family.

371
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:36,993
Get her off! Get her off!

372
00:38:37,086 --> 00:38:39,312
If you’re not ready to challenge her,
then don't look her in the eye.

373
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,926
Could you keep your big giant
arms on your side of the trail?

374
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:46,374
Isn't this fun? We’re taking
our first trip together.

375
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,774
Stop shoving, or I will
pull out your tongue!

376
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,137
Do you want me to turn
this family around? Do you?

377
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:53,584
Because I will turn this
family around so fast!

378
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:56,795
- Dad, I gotta go!
- Come on, you can hold it.

379
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,528
<i>- I don't think so.
- Sandy, take that out of your mouth.</i>

380
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:00,530
<i>- I don't touch it.
- Gran!</i>

381
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,054
<i>I still gotta go!</i>

382
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,770
<i>- Fine, just look around and make it fast.
- Quit it!</i>

383
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,313
<i>- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it!</i>

384
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:11,708
<i>- Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
- No.</i>

385
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:15,211
<i>- How about now? - No!
- Now? - No!</i>

386
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:18,150
<i>- Now?
- I can do this all day long.</i>

387
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,807
No, no, no, and still no!

388
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:24,344
I’m not dying on an empty stomach.

389
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,422
Grug, we’re all pretty tired!

390
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,789
- We’ll eat when we get there.
- It's taking too long!

391
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,501
I'm grabbing a snack.

392
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,373
Don't do that! He will cut you.
That's not food, he's a pet.

393
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:37,920
- My pet.
- What's a pet?

394
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:39,421
An animal you don't eat.

395
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:41,283
We call those children.

396
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:46,731
No man should have a pet.
It's weird. And wrong.

397
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,126
- It's, it's food!
- No, no, please!

398
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:51,372
Not that. That!

399
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,894
Food fixes everything. All right,
show me your hunting face.

400
00:39:58,026 --> 00:39:59,792
Not you! You're still grounded.

401
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,463
Come on, Thunk.

402
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,266
My feet hurt.

403
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:11,110
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.

404
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:14,381
Angry girl wants to do what
they're doing.

405
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,268
I wasn't ready.

406
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,376
Hang on, Thunk. I'm coming.

407
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:21,335
Why are you doing this?

408
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:24,705
- What are they doing?
- Hunting.

409
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,861
You stay away from me!

410
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:29,651
No, seriously, what are they doing?

411
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:32,935
You’ve got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg!

412
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,294
Now you’re just rubbing it in.

413
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:53,461
There. Who is hungry for scorpion?

414
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,105
What happened to
the egg and the bird?

415
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,400
You know, we lost 'em.

416
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:02,823
But when the bird stepped on me
and pushed me into the ground,

417
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:06,255
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me, and
you know, one thing led to another

418
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:07,842
and here we are, eating him.

419
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,751
- So, win-win.
- Not enough.

420
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:15,534
- Not enough. I need more. I need more!
- Oh, look at that.

421
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,804
She’s not gonna eat me, right?

422
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:21,240
You’re too skinny. If she was
going to eat anyone, it would be...

423
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:24,268
Mom! She locked her jaw!

424
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,271
<i>I could use stick!
Get her stick!</i>

425
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:31,618
<i>Stay away! You sick old monster!</i>

426
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,565
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

427
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:37,808
<i>Hold her still. Use a rock.</i>

428
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:41,269
Would you just hit her legs?

429
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:43,149
Why are you rolling away?

430
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,392
I just want something to eat!

431
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:48,200
You had bug for
dinner. Plenty of bug!

432
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,945
Please! I'll let you help me hunt.

433
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:56,166
- Really?
- Don't wait on me!

434
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:58,260
Tell my story.

435
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:08,635
- Okay.
- What do you call this?

436
00:42:08,636 --> 00:42:11,328
- A trap.
- What does it do?

437
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:13,365
Well...

438
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,674
How long have you been alone?

439
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,494
So what do we do?

440
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,816
How's your acting?

441
00:42:58,057 --> 00:42:59,859
You're good at this.

442
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:08,137
<i>- Sorry. No. Okay.
- Excuse me.</i>

443
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:13,540
- That’s my arm!
- Okay, I'm moving it...

444
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:30,632
- It didn't step on your trap-y thing.
- Yeah, I noticed!

445
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,362
Where's Eep?

446
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,116
She's awesome.

447
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:48,179
- Eep!
- Dad, no!

448
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:01,837
It’s an avalanche of flavor!

449
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,732
Looks like we won't
have any leftovers.

450
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,705
What are leftovers?

451
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,197
You know, when you have so much
food to eat you have some left over.

452
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,231
Well, we never have that much food.

453
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:53,384
Grug, how about a story?

454
00:44:53,537 --> 00:44:55,997
That’s a good idea.
How about a story, huh?

455
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:58,181
Yeah, a story! Tell us a story!

456
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:04,470
Once upon a time there
was a little tiger

457
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,691
who lived in a cave with her family.

458
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:11,021
There were a lot of rules,
but the big, simple one

459
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:13,664
was to never leave the cave at night.

460
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:18,904
And the door was so heavy, you’d
think it would be easy to remember.

461
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:21,522
- So easy to remember!
- I know.

462
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,968
But while everyone was asleep,

463
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:28,002
- ..she went out anyway.
- No! - Yes!

464
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:31,150
And no sooner than she
did her cave was destroyed

465
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:34,060
and everyone had to go
on this long, sucky walk,

466
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:35,953
with some weirdo they met,

467
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:37,857
and died!

468
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:41,285
The end.

469
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:45,356
I did not see that coming.
Twist ending!

470
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,294
My stories never end like that.

471
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:49,067
Yes! Two stories in one night!

472
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,467
Okay, but it won't
be as good as Grug’s.

473
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:09,230
Once upon a time, there
was a beautiful tiger.

474
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,334
She lived in a cave with
the rest of her family.

475
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,407
Her father and mother told her:
"You may go anywhere you want,

476
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:20,360
but never go near the
cliff, for you could fall."

477
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,952
And die.
Good story.

478
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,801
But when no one was looking,

479
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:29,304
she go near the cliff.

480
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,927
For the closer she came to the edge,
the more she could hear,

481
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:37,862
the more shecould see,
the more she could feel.

482
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:44,140
Finally she stood at the very edge,

483
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:49,657
and she saw a light.
She leaned out to touch it.

484
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:53,326
- And she slipped.
- And she fell.

485
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:56,088
And she flew.

486
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,272
Where did she fly?

487
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:02,146
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

488
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:05,101
A place with more suns in
the sky than you can count.

489
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:09,345
- It would be so bright.
- A place not like today, or yesterday.

490
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:12,887
A place where things are better.

491
00:47:14,174 --> 00:47:16,809
Tomorrow isn't a place.
It's, It's, It's..

492
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:22,169
- You can't see it!
- Oh, yes. Yes, it is. I’ve seen it.

493
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:27,008
That’s where I’m going.

494
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:40,635
Well, we are going to
shut our eyes and sleep.

495
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:41,906
And when we wake up,

496
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:44,609
we’re going to find the place
that has everything we want.

497
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,168
- Tomorrow?
- A cave.

498
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,459
That was too close.
It almost caught us.

499
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,293
- I was watching. We were fine.
- We gotta move faster.

500
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:34,572
Do you people have any other
speed aside from 'wander'?

501
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:38,617
- I’ll take 'shamble' at this point.
- Hey, um, do you have a minute?

502
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:43,334
- How did the tiger fly?
- I only share when I’m outside the log.

503
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:47,705
- I’m funny that way.
- Leave this to me.

504
00:48:49,067 --> 00:48:51,780
Hey, Thunk, you have
a spider on your face.

505
00:48:54,472 --> 00:48:55,483
Oops.

506
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:58,034
He's loose!

507
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:05,697
Do not step on those
weird, pointy rocks!

508
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,738
You mean these rocks?

509
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:12,083
- Do not step on these rocks!
- Step aside, girl.

510
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,135
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening!

511
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:19,137
You cannot walk on those!

512
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:34,601
Come back here now!
Come back here now!

513
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,804
Well, there goes out
chance for survival.

514
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:40,204
And our log!

515
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:42,036
Okay!

516
00:50:02,096 --> 00:50:06,351
Jumping doesn't help. I mean, just
briefly, but it doesn't get any better!

517
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:12,778
<i>Okay. Do not walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all!</i>

518
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:27,741
I can help you, but we're going to
have to make a few changes around here.

519
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:31,329
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.

520
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:38,119
Now kick it away.

521
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:42,289
Farther.

522
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:51,788
- Really?
- Okay, smart Guy.

523
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,784
Now what?

524
00:51:08,494 --> 00:51:10,296
Good fish, good fish.

525
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:15,678
Okay, now you can look.

526
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:24,234
- I love them! Where are my feet?
- They're still there.

527
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:26,755
Okay.

528
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,953
- You're really heavy.
- Really?

529
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:33,469
Thank you.

530
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,134
Hey, wait!
Whoa!

531
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:42,012
Okay, she's up. We're good.
I'm good.

532
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:45,705
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?

533
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:51,872
I'm calling it a brain.

534
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,094
I'm pretty sure it's
where ideas come from.

535
00:51:54,095 --> 00:51:56,842
Dad, I don't have a brain.

536
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:01,011
We've gotten along just fine
without brains until now.

537
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:02,616
Cavemen don't need brains.

538
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:04,491
We have these.

539
00:52:05,994 --> 00:52:08,459
That's I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings!

540
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:10,800
Now let's get to that mountain!

541
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:19,108
- Wow, I love those.
- Good fish, don't eat my feet.

542
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,724
How did the tiger fly?

543
00:52:58,727 --> 00:53:02,251
She jumped on the sun
and rode it to Tomorrow.

544
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,385
No, no, no, no!

545
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:40,698
Hi, Dad!

546
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:43,896
Bye, Dad!

547
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:52,546
- You've seen rain before, right?
- We don't get out much.

548
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:16,158
- Eep, looks dangerous.
- Ugghh..

549
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:18,376
Dad, you say that about everything.

550
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,081
- Careful.
- Really? Okay.

551
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:57,503
No, no, no! Not cool!
Not cool!

552
00:54:57,904 --> 00:54:59,400
Not cool!

553
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:20,684
The bear says: "Your cave?

554
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,988
I've been dumping my
bones here since last week."

555
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,461
- That's a funny story!
- It's not a story, it's a joke.

556
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:31,756
- What's a joke?
- You know, just making something up,

557
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,698
to make you laugh.

558
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:42,620
- Here you go. - Thanks.
- One for you, and this one's for you...

559
00:55:43,264 --> 00:55:46,249
Okay. Okay. That's enough.

560
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,673
I don't see why the kids
need their own shells.

561
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,175
So if anyone gets in trouble,
we can call the others.

562
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,973
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

563
00:55:54,974 --> 00:55:56,976
We can try more paths at once.

564
00:55:56,977 --> 00:55:59,499
- It's the fastest way through.
- The Croods stick together.

565
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,133
- Your way isn't safe.
- They can handle it.

566
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:05,333
- We can do it, Dad.
- No, no, no, no, no.

567
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:08,186
It’s my job to keep you
safe. I’m still in charge,

568
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:10,522
and we are not splitting up.

569
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:15,256
Except for you two.
And that's final.

570
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:38,129
Hello? Hello? Is everyone all right?

571
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:41,805
<i>- We're okay, Grug!
- Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.</i>

572
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,514
Just tell me what to do. Just what
do I do? What do I do right now?

573
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:48,367
- Stay where you are! I'll find you.
- No! Too slow.

574
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:51,378
Everybody, keep moving
forward and we'll get out.

575
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:53,273
<i>Dad?</i>

576
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:57,427
Yeah. Okay.

577
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:00,103
<i>Remember, never not be afraid.</i>

578
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:02,424
<i>You can do this!</i>

579
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:06,283
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna
be okay. I'm gonna pass out.

580
00:57:08,565 --> 00:57:10,367
Sandy! Sandy!

581
00:59:00,308 --> 00:59:02,356
Give me another one.

582
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:07,179
You dropped these.

583
00:59:40,128 --> 00:59:41,930
Come with me.

584
00:59:44,609 --> 00:59:46,411
Here, boy, catch!

585
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,599
Gran?

586
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:56,036
Mom?

587
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:00,185
Grug?

588
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,342
I'll go get him.

589
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:18,035
<i>Oh, good boy.
Who's my good boy?</i>

590
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,090
<i>You are. Yes, you are. Look at you.
You need a name? You want a name?</i>

591
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:25,396
I'm gonna call you Douglas.
Can you do tricks?

592
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:28,348
Roll over.
Come on, Douglas. Roll over.

593
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:35,974
Good boy, Douglas!

594
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:42,337
I was in love once.
He was a hunter.

595
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:46,049
I was a gatherer.
It was quite a scandal.

596
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:50,620
We fed each other berries.
We danced.

597
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:54,832
Then my father smashed him with a
rock and traded me to your grandfather.

598
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:01,974
Croods, get down here!

599
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:04,801
Grug, they're okay.
Guy's with them.

600
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:07,853
Oh, Guy's with them.
Oh, okay.

601
01:01:08,438 --> 01:01:13,128
Well, thank you, thank you for
bringing me that interesting Guy update.

602
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,460
Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up,

603
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:20,487
..and why don't you join us when
you stop being a big drag!

604
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,292
Sleep pile?

605
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,587
How about a story, huh?

606
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,575
Anyone?

607
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:46,941
And then Thork said:
"Know it, I drew it."

608
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:54,997
I know it was hard for
you to bring us along, but,

609
01:01:55,235 --> 01:01:58,259
they had the best days in their lives.

610
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:01,851
Thank you for that.

611
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,323
I wanna show you something.

612
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,329
More suns in the sky
than you can count.

613
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:13,868
Every sun that crosses our
sky comes to rest up there.

614
01:03:14,565 --> 01:03:17,742
- Tomorrow.
- That’s where we’ll be safe.

615
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,878
I’m going with Guy.

616
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:23,781
No, not my little girl.

617
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,685
- Come with us.
- I can't go without Grug.

618
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:34,682
Well, that makes one of us.
Count me in!

619
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,119
Really? Mom?
Now?

620
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,866
Grug has no idea how to protect
us. In fact, he has no ideas at all!

621
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:44,624
<i>No. That's not true. What
about that one time he.. uh..</i>

622
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,594
<i>- He..
- Oh, face it.</i>

623
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:50,426
If he actually had
an idea of his own,

624
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:53,778
I'd have, I'd have a heart attack and die!

625
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:00,930
- Grug?
- Dad? - Dad!

626
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:04,352
He's a big guy. How can he
just disappear like that.

627
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:08,891
Hey! Hey, wait. Let's ask that
ugly lady if she's seen Dad.

628
01:04:09,352 --> 01:04:11,554
- I haven't seen him.
- Whoah!

629
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:14,847
- What are you doing?
- Yeah. Wow. I was up all night.

630
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:18,452
'Cos I got all these ideas kept coming to me.

631
01:04:18,746 --> 01:04:22,400
- Is that a snake?
- Belt! New and improved!

632
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:26,401
It's even self-tightening.

633
01:04:26,874 --> 01:04:29,504
What is that on your head?

634
01:04:29,507 --> 01:04:31,670
It's called desperation.

635
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,173
I call it a 'rug'. Rhymes with Grug.

636
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:38,347
And this one, I call it
a 'ride'. Rhymes with Grug.

637
01:04:38,348 --> 01:04:42,369
That doesn't rhyme.. / It's gonna
get us places faster than shoes.

638
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,894
Yeah! Try to keep up!

639
01:04:51,117 --> 01:04:52,703
I wish I had a 'ride'.

640
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:55,706
Painting is a thing of the past.

641
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:59,064
I call this a 'snapshot'.

642
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:02,056
Let's do it again.
I think I blinked.

643
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,350
I call them 'shades'.

644
01:05:05,362 --> 01:05:07,352
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

645
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:10,683
- Where do you get these great ideas?
- Since I don't have a brain,

646
01:05:10,718 --> 01:05:16,180
they're coming from my stomach, down deep
below, and then up again into my mind.

647
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,147
Grug, we have to keep moving.

648
01:05:20,152 --> 01:05:23,451
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

649
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:28,353
Like this. I call it a 'mobile home'.
Isn't that something?

650
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:34,618
- I'm calling this one a 'lifterator'.
- Mom?

651
01:05:34,653 --> 01:05:37,155
It's.. I know. It's bad.

652
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,554
I almost feel sorry for him.

653
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:48,833
No, I don't.

654
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:51,476
<i>What are you trying to do, Grug?</i>

655
01:05:52,189 --> 01:05:57,084
I thought if I could
have ideas like Guy,

656
01:05:57,257 --> 01:06:00,597
uh, maybe Eep would listen to me.

657
01:06:00,598 --> 01:06:04,060
Maybe she wouldn't
want to go with Guy.

658
01:06:04,595 --> 01:06:08,197
Oh, Grug. Is that
what this is all about?

659
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:15,769
And I also thought it would
kill your mother, so...

660
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:18,102
you know, win-win.

661
01:06:18,137 --> 01:06:19,939
We're here!

662
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:03,398
Cave! Everyone inside! Come on!
Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!

663
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:06,621
No!

664
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:11,566
- No more caves, Grug.
- What?

665
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:15,098
We're gonna jump on the sun and
ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

666
01:07:15,133 --> 01:07:18,628
Wait, wait, so you're
all going to do this?

667
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:20,665
Thunk?

668
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:24,268
Sorry, Dad.

669
01:07:25,536 --> 01:07:27,503
You have to stop
worrying for all of us.

670
01:07:27,538 --> 01:07:30,428
It's my job to worry.
It's my job to follow the rules.

671
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,818
- The rules don't work out here!
- They kept us alive!

672
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:39,492
That wasn't living! That was just..
Not dying! There's a difference.

673
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:42,500
Ugga, everyone, you
have to listen to me!

674
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:45,120
We'd be dead now if
we'd listened to you!

675
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:49,214
We have to follow Guy now.

676
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:56,825
- Guy..
- Guy, run!

677
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:08,644
This is pointless!
We've running out of time!

678
01:08:08,645 --> 01:08:12,105
Everything is collapsing. You are
being irrational and counterproductive.

679
01:08:12,169 --> 01:08:13,968
Big words anger me!

680
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,212
- Keep talking!
- Countermeasures!

681
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,134
Remember how you were this morning?
You changed,

682
01:08:20,135 --> 01:08:22,537
remember? Idea man.
Modern man.

683
01:08:22,716 --> 01:08:27,073
- I am a caveman!
- No, no, no, wait!

684
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:52,614
No! What is this stuff that
save you from my punches?

685
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,060
- Tar.
- No! - Please..

686
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:58,859
- No! I have to get back to them!
- You have to stop...

687
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:02,194
- ..struggling!
- No! - Grug, stop!

688
01:09:08,392 --> 01:09:13,292
No one gets out of this.
Believe me.

689
01:09:14,037 --> 01:09:15,839
I know.

690
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:18,841
- Your..?
- Family.

691
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,244
Yeah.

692
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:28,085
Sorry.

693
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,765
I was little when it happened.

694
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:37,358
The last thing my
parents told me was,

695
01:09:37,485 --> 01:09:40,935
"Don't hide. Live."

696
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:47,600
"Follow the sun. You'll
make it to Tomorrow."

697
01:09:49,963 --> 01:09:54,938
You followed the light.
My daughter is a lot like you.

698
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:57,936
No. She's like you.

699
01:09:57,941 --> 01:10:00,362
She loves you but
always forgets to say it.

700
01:10:01,237 --> 01:10:03,715
Just like you forget to tell her.

701
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:11,624
I guess I was just busy
keeping them all alive.

702
01:10:12,264 --> 01:10:15,275
It's okay. That's what dads do.

703
01:10:22,629 --> 01:10:27,624
That's right, and we
can't do that from here.

704
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,199
We need one of your ideas.

705
01:10:33,278 --> 01:10:36,101
Come on, you can do it.

706
01:10:40,589 --> 01:10:44,098
Belt! Emergency Idea
Generator, activate.

707
01:10:46,135 --> 01:10:47,937
Ooh, I've got it.

708
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:55,419
- Wow!
- Yeah. I know, but,

709
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,936
he's doing the best with
what he has. Let's go.

710
01:11:04,202 --> 01:11:06,004
There he is.

711
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,394
Belt, I want romance,
drama, sincerity.

712
01:11:09,429 --> 01:11:11,231
Move me.

713
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:20,707
Okay, he sees us! That's our cue.
Now work it!

714
01:11:29,127 --> 01:11:32,767
He's not coming over. I don't think
out puppet looks scared enough.

715
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,655
Scared? I’ll show you scared!

716
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,074
Hand me those acting sticks!

717
01:11:52,837 --> 01:11:55,622
Hold on!

718
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,184
Yes! You did it!

719
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:28,832
- Grug!
- Dad!

720
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,635
Hey! We're okay!

721
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:37,108
Yeah. We're okay.

722
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:51,437
Grug, your call.

723
01:12:53,331 --> 01:12:55,455
Take us to Tomorrow.

724
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:04,633
Hurry! Come on! We're gonna make it!

725
01:13:06,336 --> 01:13:09,433
- You were right!
- There, there it is!

726
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:13,523
The sun! We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!

727
01:13:38,005 --> 01:13:39,807
Run!

728
01:14:07,148 --> 01:14:12,560
I don't, I don't understand. The
sun was right here! It was right here!

729
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,772
We have to go back to the cave!
Hurry!

730
01:14:19,947 --> 01:14:23,665
<i>Hurry, hurry, stay together! Let's
keep moving. Move! Move, move!</i>

731
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:28,490
<i>Everybody hold my hand! Thunk, let's go!
Go, go, go! Let's stay together!</i>

732
01:14:28,525 --> 01:14:31,348
Let's..
Grug, what's wrong with you?

733
01:14:31,349 --> 01:14:34,048
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

734
01:14:58,312 --> 01:15:04,001
Grug, listen to me.
We've to get back to that cave.

735
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:11,015
No more dark.
No more hiding.

736
01:15:11,922 --> 01:15:14,149
No more caves.

737
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:17,765
What's the point of all this?

738
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,551
To follow the light.

739
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:31,030
I can't change,
I don't have ideas.

740
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:34,925
But I have my strength.

741
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:38,762
And right now that's all you need.

742
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:45,132
No! We don't know what's over there!
Maybe nothing. It's too risky!

743
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,534
It's a chance.

744
01:15:58,363 --> 01:16:00,636
I'll take that chance.

745
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:06,163
You know, I wanted to throw you away
ever since I met you.

746
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,584
- That's a joke, right?
- What's a joke?

747
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,031
He made it!

748
01:16:44,472 --> 01:16:47,029
He made it.

749
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:54,011
- Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
- You're not coming, are you?

750
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:57,210
When you make it, so will I.

751
01:17:15,622 --> 01:17:17,424
You did good.

752
01:17:19,126 --> 01:17:20,927
Dadda.

753
01:17:33,386 --> 01:17:36,086
- Gran..
- No mush, just throw me.

754
01:17:36,802 --> 01:17:42,093
Wait! You surprised me today.
Lunkhead.

755
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,541
Still alive!

756
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:55,624
- Time to go.
- No! I have too much to say to you.

757
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:58,773
I need to fix everything,
and I don't have time.

758
01:17:58,808 --> 01:17:59,874
I can fix it.

759
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,522
This works good.

760
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,340
What do you call it?

761
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:12,374
I was thinking of calling it, a 'hug',

762
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:15,650
because it rhymes with Grug.

763
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:19,681
But you can change it if you want.

764
01:18:20,254 --> 01:18:23,880
No, no, I like hug.

765
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:31,489
I love you.

766
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:36,613
I..

767
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:43,232
Dad..

768
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:47,569
- I'm scared.
- Never be afraid.

769
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:28,012
There! I see him.

770
01:20:13,032 --> 01:20:15,223
Hey! Hey, I did it!

771
01:21:37,497 --> 01:21:40,367
Stay back! Stay back!

772
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:29,310
They're in trouble. Hang on!
I'm coming!

773
01:22:30,648 --> 01:22:33,583
How do I get across?
I gotta think.

774
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:37,828
What would Guy do?
What would Guy do?

775
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,136
What would I do?

776
01:22:43,534 --> 01:22:45,496
Hold this.

777
01:23:00,161 --> 01:23:02,771
I.. have..

778
01:23:03,956 --> 01:23:08,234
an.. idea!

779
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:31,245
Run!

780
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:12,187
Yes!

781
01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:24,247
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy!

782
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:00,220
Hold on!

783
01:25:43,563 --> 01:25:45,653
It's not safe here.

784
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,303
I'll tell her.

785
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,896
I've never had to tell him.

786
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:43,621
Eep, if your dad were here,
he would tell you to...

787
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,995
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

788
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:49,373
Wow, you sound just like him.

789
01:26:49,408 --> 01:26:51,710
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

790
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:55,833
- Dadda!
- He did it!

791
01:26:55,853 --> 01:26:58,328
He's riding the sun.

792
01:26:58,973 --> 01:27:02,873
- But.. not very well.
- Everybody out of the way!

793
01:27:08,622 --> 01:27:10,770
Grug!

794
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:13,456
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?

795
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,139
I love you, too!

796
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:28,598
One, two, three, four,

797
01:27:28,616 --> 01:27:32,883
five, six, and..

798
01:27:32,885 --> 01:27:35,468
Seven.

799
01:27:36,814 --> 01:27:38,616
And a half.

800
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:41,125
And eight.

801
01:27:41,778 --> 01:27:45,038
- Nine..
- Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

802
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:47,193
Well, boy's got to have a pet.

803
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,948
Turns out I'm a cat person.

804
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:58,177
Uh.. No!

805
01:28:06,655 --> 01:28:09,911
You really need to see this.

806
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,622
We should go there.

807
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:26,264
Yes! Coming through!

808
01:28:34,933 --> 01:28:37,627
<i>This is me.
My name is Eep.</i>

809
01:28:37,941 --> 01:28:41,049
<i>And this is my family, the Croods.</i>

810
01:28:41,098 --> 01:28:43,961
<i>If you weren't clued
by sunbathes and pets,</i>

811
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,644
<i>we're not exactly cavemen anymore.</i>

812
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:52,194
Let's do it again.
I think I blinked.

813
01:28:53,148 --> 01:28:56,202
<i>Our world is still
plenty harsh and hostile.</i>

814
01:28:57,951 --> 01:29:00,327
<i>But now we know the
Croods will make it,</i>

815
01:29:00,362 --> 01:29:04,826
<i>because we changed the rules.
The ones that kept us in the dark.</i>

816
01:29:08,313 --> 01:29:12,454
<i>And because of my dad, who taught
us that anyone could change.</i>

817
01:29:12,566 --> 01:29:14,368
Release the baby!

818
01:29:18,026 --> 01:29:21,292
<i>Well, sort of...</i>

819
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:42,047
<i>So from now on,
we'll stay out here,</i>

820
01:29:43,001 --> 01:29:45,018
<i>where we can follow the light.</i>
