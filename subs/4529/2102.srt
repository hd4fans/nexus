00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,068
他应该认识不少黑人
But he knows a lot of black people, I guess.

132
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,945
噢
Uh-huh.

133
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:38,281
我自己完全没头绪
I don't know what I got myself into.

134
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,639
（呼叫邦妮奶奶）

135
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,218
- 喂？
- 奶奶
- Hello?

136
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,554
奥斯卡，你好吗？

141
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,565
我以为你在玩手机

142
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,234
没有，奶奶，我这有位顾客

She wants to have a fish fry,
but she don't know how.

144
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:18,905
你能告诉她怎么做吗？
You think you can tell her
everything she needs to know?

145
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:22,284
没问题，她想做什么炸鱼？
Oh, no problem, baby.
What kind of fish does she want to fry?

146
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:23,952
奶奶，她也不知道
Grandma, she don't know.

147
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,747
她不知道自己要做什么炸鱼？
She don't know what kind
of fish she wants to fry?

148
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,833

- Hey, good morning, Emi.

155
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,110
给我妈妈的生日准备东西
Trying to pick up some stuff

156
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,737
东西都买齐了吧
Hope you found everything you need.

157
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,947
我想跟你说几句
Yeah, I just want to talk to you
for a second.

158
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,658
现在不行，节假日忙死了
It's a little nuts right now,holiday and all.

159
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,786
我想谈谈我工作的事

161
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,793
我真的很需要这份工作
Look, I really need this job, all right?

162
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,420
过去我的处境很糟，我现在想重新开始
I was going through some shit before
trying to get back on my feet,

163
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,048
你知道我需要这份工作

164
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:21,092
你可以让我每周一班，我没意见
You can start me off with one shift
a week or whatever, I'll be here.

165
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,553
付我一半工资就行
Work me 40 hours, only pay me for 20. . .

166
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,973
我已经雇了别人
Dude, I hired somebody else.

167
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:30,811
我如果让你回来，就得开除别的员工
For me to bring you back, that means
I have to let someone else go.

168
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:33,980
从没迟到过一次的员工
Someone who's never showed up late once.

169
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,650
不好意思，我喜欢你这人

172
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,365
奥斯卡

00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,992
要我在外面等你忙完再谈吗？
You need me outside waiting
for you to get done, bruh?

174
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,869
你自己保重
You take care of yourself.

175
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,457

- Just answer your phone. Be safe, bruh.
- All right. Yep.

189
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,081
（香蒂来电）

190
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,537
- 喂？

Gimme the bad news first.

197
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,473

I'm gonna need some help
with rent this month.

198
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,226

But I need you to get her a card

204
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,376
没问题

Osc, don't get me no fake-ass card with
no white people on it.I want a black card.

206
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:57,457
- 没问题

207

208
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,920
拜拜
Whatever, bye.

209
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:11,805
（呼叫马库斯）

210
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:18,853
什么事，奥斯卡？
What's up with it, Osc?

211
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:21,356
你好吗，老兄，昨晚是我的错

你今天气色不错

246
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:00,193
塔蒂阿娜昨晚去看你了吗？
My girls came to see you last night?

247
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:04,650
- 我们一起玩了棋盘游戏

- We played board games.
- I bet y'all let her win, too.

248
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,902

- 太弱了
- Of course.
- Y'all hella weak for that.

249
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,487
她没这么容易赢我
She'll get no easy wins around me.

250
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:11,573
- 嗯

我把爆米花倒进碗里
While I was putting it in the bowl,

254
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,167
塔蒂阿娜站在那瞪着我
Tatiana just standing there,staring up at me,

255
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,754
好像她想要什么
looking like she wanted something.

256
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:28,006
后来呢，说啊
OK, then what? Come on, Ma.

257
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:31,927
她问我，外婆，有高脂奶油吗？
She says, "Grandma,
do we have any dark butter?"

258
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:34,596
高脂奶油？
Dark. . . What's dark butter?

259
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,975
我想她可能在美食频道看到过
I'm thinking maybe she watched
Food Network or something.

260
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:40,936
我说，孩子，什么是高脂奶油？
I said, "Sweetheart, what's dark butter?"

261
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:45,023
她说，爸爸带我去看《机器人瓦力》时
And she said, "Well, when my daddy took me to see Wall-E,

262
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,900
他点的低脂奶油
he asked for light butter.

263
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,528
所以这次我要尝尝高脂奶油
So now I want to try some dark butter this time."

264
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,198
- 她很聪明
- 这是你妈妈？
- She too smart. . .
- This Moms right here?

265
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,118
- 她也是小偷？
- 你说她什么？
- She a snitch, too?
- What the fuck you say about my moms?

266
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:58,871
- 去你妈的
- 要不是这有警卫
- Fuck you and this bitch.
- Talking tough with these guards.

267
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,747
如果在外面我揍扁你
I'm gonna see your bitch-ass on the outside.

268
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,833
- 帕尔马黑鬼
- 混蛋
- Bitch-ass Palma Ceia nigger.
- Bitch-ass motherfucker.

269
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:05,168
- 奥斯卡
- 关你屁事
- Oscar. . .
- Fuck DGF!

270
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:06,879
- 有事吗？
- 去你妈的
- Is there a problem in here?
- Oh, fuck you!

271
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,923
- 有事吗？
- 没事
- Is there a problem here?
- No, we good.

272
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,051
现在没事
Yeah, we good for now.

273
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,140
没事
Yeah.

274
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,226
你妈的
Yeah, fucked up. . .

275
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:28,233
冷静点
Calm down.

276
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,652
奥斯卡
Oscar.

277
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,241
你脸怎么了？
What happened to your face?

278
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:40,621
高脂奶油
Dark butter. . .

279
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,124
她很注意别人说什么
She always listenin'.

280
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,460
她太聪明了
Too damn smart for her own good.

281
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:49,630
幼儿园的人说，我们可以让她早点上学
Pre-school said, we should think about
starting her in school early. . .

282
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:52,382
苏菲娅跟你说了吗？
Phina tell you that?

283
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,302
我们会让她上私立学校
Yeah, we'll put her in private school.

284
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:59,097
统一的校服
Uniforms.

285
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,974
那天我看了圣B小学
I was looking at Saint B the other day,

286
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:04,746
他们那里实行西班牙语和英语双语教学
and they got this new thing where they start 'em off
speaking Spanish,then they put them back on English. . .

287
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:07,147
我不会再来这里
I'm not coming here anymore.

288
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,524
什么？
What?

289
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,778
我不会再来监狱看你
I'm not coming here
for these visits anymore.

290
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,738
- 这是最后一次
- 我知道
- This is my last time.
- I know, I know. . .

291
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:16,490
这也是我最后一次犯事
I know, this is
the last time for me, too.

292
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:17,950
我不会再犯事
I told you that.
I ain't going down no more.

293
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,204
你让苏菲娅承担这一切而你却撒手不管
You wanna keep putting Sophina through
this, then you go right ahead, OK?

294
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,332
塔蒂阿娜不该经历这些，奥斯卡
But Tatiana? That baby
doesn't deserve this, Oscar.

295
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,542
她还不懂这些
She's too young to know what's going on.

296
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,711
我想这就是为什么她问我
So I guess that's why
she asked me why you love

297
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:32,214
你宁愿度假也不愿陪她
taking your vacations more
than you like being with her.

298
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:36,093
- 她不会这么说
- 你是说我骗你咯
- She ain't say that.
- Oh, so I'm a liar now.

299
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:42,391
你跟她说我爱她
Ma, you got to tell her I love her.

300
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,019
- 跟她说…
- 你自己跟她说吧
- Tell her I . . .
- Tell her yourself.

301
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:48,146
下次你打电话回家自己跟她说
The next time you call home,
you tell her yourself.

302
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,565
或者让她来这里看你
Or better yet,
let her come visit you here.

303
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,859
我
Yeah, but I . . .

304
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,698
她不需要知道
She don't need to be exposed. . .

305
00:25:57,865 --> 00:26:00,784
你已经让她知道了
You already exposed her. . .

306
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:03,662
- 你已经让她知道了
- 这么说你不管我了？
- You already exposed her to this.
- So what, you gonna leave me?

307
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,914
你打算又不管我，你是什么妈妈？
You gonna leave me again?
What kind of mom is you?

308
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:08,250
你打算把我扔在这里不管？
You gonna fuck around
and leave me in here?

309
00:26:08,418 --> 00:26:11,420
你从没要我回去
You ain't never had my fuckin' back anyway.

310
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,968
我一个人在这
I'm in here by myself.

311
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,890
- 我爱你，奥斯卡
- 你什么也不爱
- I love you, Oscar.
- You don't love nothin'.

312
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,308
真的
I do.

313
00:26:25,476 --> 00:26:28,103
我为你祷告
And I'm praying for you.

314
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,357
等你出来时再见
I'll see you when you get home.

315
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:35,736
等等，抱下我好吗？
Hey Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma?

316
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,904
格兰特，回到探访区
Grant,back to the visiting area.

317
00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:39,740
妈妈，对不起，走开
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck out of here!

318
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,368
妈妈，对不起，至少抱下我，至少抱下我
Ma, I'm sorry! At least get a hug!
Ma, let me just get a hug!

319
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,954
妈妈，对不起，放开我
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck off me!

320
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:48,623
放开我，妈妈，对不起
Get the fuck off me!
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!

321
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:52,419
妈妈，对不起，放开我
Ma, I'm sorry!
Get the fuck off me!

322
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:54,254
放开我，妈妈
Get the fuck off me, bruh!
Hey, Ma. . . !

323
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,559
没想到我们还能再碰面
Shit, bruh. I didn't think
we was ever going to hook up.

324
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:52,771
- 怎么了？
- 我没事
- What's good?
- I'm smooth.

325
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,856
我有好消息和坏消息
I got good news
and bad news, though, my nig.

326
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:56,983
别跟我说你没拿货
Don't tell me you ain't got it.

327
00:27:57,151 --> 00:28:00,112
- 卖给了一个白人
- 真的，多少钱？
- Sold it to a white boy.
- For real? For how much?

328
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,447
付了我一千块
Gave me a rack for it.

329
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,783
我不会出这么高价钱
I wasn't gonna pay that high.

330
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,661
尽管我需要，好消息是什么？
I still need it, though. What's good?

331
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,374
给你的
For the drive up?

332
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,167
好极了
Right on, Osc.

333
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,922
不用付钱
No, you're good, bruh.

334
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,800
- 真的？
- 收下吧
- You sure?
- Take it.

335
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,969
好
Right on.

336
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:38,942
你要来一根吗？
Burn one with your boy
right quick, though.

337
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,194
不用，你抽吧
Nah, it's all you, bruh.

338
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:44,906
好的，保重
Right on, Osc.
All right, bruh. Be smooth.

339
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,867
保重
Yeah.

340
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,237
能马上送我去奶奶家换衣服吗？
Can you take me to my grandma's house
real quick to get changed?

341
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,822
可以
Yeah.

342
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,034
你买的什么蛋糕？
What kind of cake you get?

343
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,785
胡萝卜蛋糕
Carrot cake.

344
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:32,537
为什么不选冰淇淋的？
Why you ain't get ice cream?

345
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,581
又不是你生日
'Cause it ain't your birthday.

346
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:41,046
如果把你的东西放在我那里就方便多了
You know, it'd be hella easier
if you had your stuff at my spot, right?

347
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,590
你为什么不搬过来？
Why don't you just move in?

348
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:47,302
等你接T前不再在车里抽大麻那天
Maybe when you stop blowing trees
in the car before we pick up T.

349
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:58,939
能把车窗摇下来吗？
Can you roll down the window, please?

350
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,652
T，过来
Hey T! T! Come here.

351
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,570
- 爸爸
- 小家伙
- Daddy!
- Hey, what's up, nugget?

352
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:50,115
孩子
Hey, what's up, girl?

353
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:54,160
玩得开心吗？
How you doin'?

354
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:55,745
- 开心
- 开心？
- Good.
- Good?

355
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,497
今天我们玩了抓人游戏
We played freeze tag today.

356
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,332
是吗，你赢了没？
Really? Did you win?

357
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,044
- 他们抓不到我
- 你一定跑的很快
- They couldn't catch me.
- Think you fast, huh?

358
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:07,549
比爸爸还快？
Think you're faster than Daddy?

359
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,594
真的？
Mm. Really?

360
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:13,555
那是什么？
What's that?

361
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:15,640
嘿
Hey!

362
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:30,113
我打不败的，我打不败的
Undefeated! Undefeated!

363
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:36,036
你还没打败我，知道吗？
You still haven't beaten me yet.
You know that, right?

364
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,497
- 你干什么？
- 什么意思？
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

365
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,000
- 你把车弄坏了
- 没事的
- You're going to break this car!
- It'll be all right.

366
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:46,212
- 车都快散架了
- 我不能输，打不败的
- It's already falling apart.
- I can't lose. Undefeated.

367
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,589
爸爸无敌
Daddy's 100 and 0.

368
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,758
大骗子，你这个大骗子
Big, big, big cheater.
You're a cheater.

369
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,259
我没作弊
I didn't cheat.

370
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,969
你怎么知道我作弊？
How do you know if I cheated or not?

371
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:56,014
你刚才在车里，T，你妈妈怀恨在心
You were sitting in the car.
T, Mommy's a hater.

372
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:12,822
- 奶奶？
- 什么事？
- Grandma?
- Yes?

373
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,241
今晚你能照看下T吗，我们要去旧金山
Can you watch T tonight?
We want to go to 'Frisco.

374
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,410
问你姐姐
Ask your sister.

375
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:19,204
但是罗斯要照看好几个孩子
But Rose got hella kids to watch.

376
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:24,167
照看六个或七个孩子有区别吗？
But what's the difference
between watching six kids or watching seven kids?

377
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:36,008
（西班牙语）

378
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:44,771
爸爸，你衣服上是什么？
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

379
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,067
爸爸工作时出了点意外
Daddy had an accident at work.

380
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:53,947
工作的事怎么样？
How is work, by the way?

381
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:56,991
工作就是工作
Work is. . . work.

382
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:08,044
我等下回来
I'll be back.

383
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,105
这件怎么样？
What you think?

384
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,401
挺好看
It's cool.

385
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,446
床上那件衣服是给你的
Put a shirt on the bed
for you, if you want.

386
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:38,032
我换上
Right on.

387
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:46,040
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

388
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,261
奥斯卡，怎么了？
Osc. . . What's up?

389
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,307
嗯？
Hm?

390
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:07,103
我工作丢了
Fuck it. I lost my job.

391
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:15,069
为什么？
For what?

392
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:17,155
上班迟到
Being late.

393
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,867
前阵子想挣点钱
Last couple of days,
trying to get some money.

394
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:24,787
他们今天告诉你的？
And they told you today? On your day off?

395
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:28,625
两个星期前的事了
Can I keep it real?
They told me two weeks ago.

396
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:33,254
我的错，苏菲娅
My bad, Phina.

397
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:38,092
我以为可以要回工作
I thought I was gonna get my job back. . .

398
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,221
你以为生活闹着玩的吗？
You think life's a fucking joke?

399
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:42,847
你以为被开除了
You think you're gonna get fired

400
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:45,642
有人会给你工作吗？
and somebody's gonna
give you your job back?

401
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:52,649
你现在打算怎么办？
What? What game you running now, Osc?

402
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,360
你什么都不是
You ain't shit, you know that?

403
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,321
你对我撒谎，对你自己的女儿撒谎
You lie to me, you lie
to your fucking daughter. . .

404
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:02,116
我不该跟你说的，这样一切都会照旧
I ain't had to tell your ass nothing.
Food on the table, the lights still on.

405
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:03,743
我应该瞒着你的，你不用知道这些
I could've kept getting it,
you wouldn't have known shit.

406
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,995
你打算就这么瞒下去？
Oh, so you would've just kept faking?

407
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:09,582
然后整天在外面混
And been out there bustin' knocks,
and doing whatever else,or whoever else. . .

408
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,209
你说你想听真话
You say you want the truth, right?

409
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:14,629
你根本不听我说什么
You ain't even tryin' to hear me.
You ain't even trying to hear it.

410
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:16,172
你根本不听我说什么
You ain't even listening to me.

411
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,718
因为你瞒了两个星期，现在被逼入绝境，没得选择
Not after you lie for two weeks,
get cornered, and don't have a choice.

412
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,513
这不是男子汉的行为
That's some pussy-ass shit.

413
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:26,683
你今天干什么了？
What'd you do today? Huh?

414
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:29,686
你肯定去卖大麻了
I bet you sold that fucking zip.

415
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,521
我已经不做了
I dumped that shit, Phina.

416
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,315
我正想告诉你
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

417
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,236
我好累
I'm tired.

418
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:42,115
以为我可以重新来过
Thought I could start over fresh, but. . .

419
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:45,076
但事情没这么顺利
. . .shit ain't workin' out.

420
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,300
你没卖大麻又没找到工作？
You threw a whole zip of weed out
and you don't got a job?

421
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,516
我真想扇你
I could slap you right now.

422
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,859
你怎么办？
What are you gonna do?

423
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,530
做些合法的事
Something legal.

424
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:27,910
也许我可以好好的过30天
Maybe if I could just
not fuck up for 30 days.

425
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:35,335
奥普拉不是说养成一种习惯需要30天吗？
That's how long Oprah said
it takes to form a habit, right?

426
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,134
看着我
Look at me.

427
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:48,222
别再让我一人承担这些
Don't make me have to go
through this shit alone, again.

428
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,828
脱掉，脱掉
Get this off. Take it off.

429
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,794
“呐”和“哈”的发音明显不同
A distinct difference
between "Nah" and "Haa."

430
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:22,340
对
Yeah.

431
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,908
你们来的刚好
Hey, you guys are just in time!

432
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:50,618
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

433
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:52,370
你们给我买了生日蛋糕？
Oh, you guys got me a cake, too?

434
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,915
- 生日快乐
- 谢谢你，孩子
- Yup. Happy birthday.
- Thank you, baby.

435
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,628
好香啊
Smells good in here.

436
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,131
下来
Here you go.

437
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,051
看看你
Look at you. . .

438
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,345
奶奶
Hey Grandma.

439
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:11,222
什么这么香？
What's smelling so good?

440
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,057
奥斯卡
Oh, Osc. . .

441
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:16,018
你知道我只要两个，你不用花这么多钱
Baby, you know I only needed two.
You didn't have to spend so much money.

442
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:18,187
妈妈，这个你不用担心
Mama, you don't gotta worry about that.

443
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,523
- 噢
- 好吧
- Oh. . .
- OK.

444
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:24,944
- 干嘛呢？
- 在做坏事
- What's up?
- We're up to no good. . .

445
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:30,032
- 你们好吗？
- 你好吗，奥斯卡？
- How you guys doing?
- How you doin', Oscar?

446
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,576
一切都好吗，奥斯卡？
What's going on, Oscar?

447
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,453
- 都挺好的
- 真的？
- Nothin', hangin' out.
- Yeah?

448
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,621
弄点吃的，我饿了
Get some food. I'm hungry.

449
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:36,956
你拿的什么？
Uh-oh, what you got?

450
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:38,916
给妈妈的卡片
Mom's card.

451
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,712
香蒂让我替她买张卡片
Tay wanted me to go pick her up one.

452
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,797
- 给你
- 谢谢
- There you go.
- Appreciate that.

453
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:47,216
她看到这个一定会疯掉
She's gonna flip out over this one.

454
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:50,970
- 不是吧
- 那是香蒂
- Oh, come on, now.
- That's Chantay there.

455
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:55,975
拿东西进来了，把它放在…
We got stuff comin' in.
You want to put it in. . .

456
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:59,562
不能扔掉
You can't dump it!

457
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,398
我这么小的时候她就这样对我说的
No, that's what she told me when I was this size.

458
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,567
“不能扔掉”
"You can't dump it!"

459
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,156
T，你爸爸像你这么小的时候
You know, T,when your daddy was your size,

460
00:39:10,324 --> 00:39:13,034
他经常跟我和奶奶做这些
just your age, he used to do this
with me and grandma.

461
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:17,497
是的，不过他没你做的好
Yes, he did, but he didn't do
it nearly as well as you're doing it.

462
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:22,126
没错，他洗过的我都得重新洗
No, he did not. I had to re-crack
everything he cracked.

463
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:26,589
苏菲娅，你们很相爱
Sophina, you are in love, honey.

464
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:29,509
- 是的
- 因为他不是大考验
- I am.
- 'Cause he was not a great try.

465
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,345
你觉得这届超级碗哪个队会赢？
Who you think gonna win the Super Bowl?

466
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:34,180
- 钢人队
- 钢人队？
- The Steelers.
- Steelers?

467
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:36,224
- 是的，钢人队
- 什么？
- Yeah, the Steelers. Yeah.
- What?

468
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:38,267
突击者的球迷支持钢人队
A Raiders fan cheerin' for the Steelers.

469
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:41,103
突击者的球迷支持钢人队
Yes, a Raiders fan cheerin' for the Steelers.

470
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:44,899
黑色队服、黑人球员、黑人教练
Black uniforms,
black players, black coach.

471
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:49,529
教练的老婆也是黑人，我支持钢人队
Coach even has a black wife.
I'm going for the Steelers.

472
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:51,113
你疯了
You insane!

473
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:53,783
我知道自己疯了
I know I'm insane.
You know I'm insane?

474
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:56,828
- 开饭啦
- 马上来
- It's ready.
- All good!

475
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,246
你不伺候我们？
You ain't goin' to serve us?

476
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,581
我从没伺候过你，塞费斯
I didn't serve you your whole life, Cephus.

477
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:02,041
开饭啦
OK, get us somethin' to eat!

478
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,554
来段美食舞蹈
Doin' my food dance.

479
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,639
我的盘子呢，旺达？
Where my table tray, Wanda?

480
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:19,600
你的盘子在你房间，达里尔
I got your table tray
at your house, Daryl.

481
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:24,188
塞费斯，刚才是你？
Oh, Cephus, that was you?

482
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:26,357
那是塞费斯，你知道不是我
That was Cephus,you know that wasn't me. . .

483
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,862
不好意思，达里尔，不好意思
I'm sorry, Daryl. I'm sorry.

484
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,824
给你的，孩子，还要加点蟹肉吗？
Here you are, sweetheart. There you go.
You want a little more crab?

485
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:36,951
够了
I'm good.

486
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,081
谢谢，谢谢
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

487
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:45,334
- 不要这样
- 你们够了
- None of that.
- All right, you all.

488
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:48,379
大家一起来
All right, everybody.

489
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,214
万能的主啊
Oh, Heavenly Father,

490
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,593
谢谢你让我们全家相聚
we thank you for having
our family together tonight.

491
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,098
我们很幸运能享受奶奶做的她拿手的汤
We are blessed that Grandma Bonnie made her famous gumbo.

492
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:02,143
谢谢你赐给我们丰盛的晚餐，阿门
In your name, let's feast. Amen.

493
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:04,020
阿门
Amen.

494
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:15,197
- 生日快乐，妈妈
- 最好的生日礼物
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Best birthday present.

495
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,327
谢谢你今晚帮忙
Thanks for your help tonight.

496
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,122
妈妈，你不用谢我
Come on, Mama.
You ain't got to thank me.

497
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,458
我本来就不该让你做这些
I shouldn't even be letting you do this.

498
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:28,878
没事，很轻松
Oh, please. It's relaxing.

499
00:41:29,046 --> 00:41:31,255
你爱说什么就说什么
Yeah, if you say so.

500
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:33,257
我说的
I say so.

501
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:39,597
你们今晚有什么安排？
You guys got plans for the night?

502
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:41,766
没什么重要的事
Yeah, nothing major though.

503
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,936
和伙伴们一起进城
Meet up with the fellas,
head out to the city.

504
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,480
你们出去玩还是？
You guys going out, out? Or. . .

505
00:41:47,648 --> 00:41:50,149
我们会很低调的
I think we're just gonna be low-key.

506
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:54,820
看完烟花后也许会去逛逛
Catch the fireworks, probably
roll around a little bit after that.

507
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,489
逛逛？
Roll around?

508
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:59,867
放心
It's gonna be cool, though.

509
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:03,329
再说，苏菲娅明早还得上班
Chill. Plus, Phina's gotta get up
and go to work in the morning anyway.

510
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,166
你们会喝酒吗？
You guys gonna be drinking?

511
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:08,370
妈妈，他们会喝酒
Mama, they gonna be drinking.

512
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:13,756
我上次喝酒是什么时候都记不起来了
I haven't had a drink since. . .
I can't even remember.

513
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:17,802
要不你们坐地铁去吧
Why don't you take the train out there.

514
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,765
这样你们就可以喝酒，出去玩也没什么好担心的
That way you guys can drink and hang out
and not have to worry about anything.

515
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,476
我们去去就回
Nah, I feel like getting
over there and getting back.

516
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:28,938
- 不用做地铁
- 坐地铁还不堵车
- Not waiting on no train.
- No traffic, either.

517
00:42:29,106 --> 00:42:31,732
去和回来的路上一定很堵
You know? You know it's gonna be crazy,
going and coming back.

518
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:35,528
我们也许会坐地铁
Yeah, we might take it.

519
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,574
别让我老盯着你们
Don't make me follow you guys to make sure.

520
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:42,535
记得毕业舞会的事吗？
Remember prom?

521
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:46,414
正想忘记
Trying to forget.

522
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,872
（发短信给克里斯：我们坐地铁去吧）

523
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:03,931
走了，我们得走了
We gotta go. We're gonna go, OK?

524
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:05,558
亲爱的，谢谢你
Honey, thank you.

525
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:08,060
没事吧？
You good?

526

- 不好
- 不好？

- No?

557
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:33,347
如果不刷牙，你的牙齿会烂掉
'Cause if you don't,
your teeth is going to rot

558
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,557
你的口气就会像汤饭一样

561
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,147
因为汤饭怪物会来抓你
'Cause then the Gumbo Monster
will get you!

562
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,319

你也吃了汤饭

00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:00,525
里面的牙齿也要刷
Get those chompers in the back.

566
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:13,496
下面
Down low.

567
00:46:13,664 --> 00:46:15,498
差点就赢了我

568
00:46:19,253 --> 00:46:20,587

00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:33,350
我们要走了

571
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,643
你们不在这里过夜吗？
You guys aren't going to sleep over, too?

572
00:46:35,811 --> 00:46:37,437
我们已经答应朋友

573
00:46:37,605 --> 00:46:39,564
今晚和他们出去
we was going to kick it with them tonight.

574
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:42,817
我们会在你起床前回来
But we'll be back before
you wake up though, OK?

575
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,988
不要走
No! Don't go.

576
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:52,289
我害怕

我听到外面有枪声

那些是烟花的声音
You know what, baby?

580
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:10,683
你和表兄表姐们在屋里很安全
You're safe inside with your cousins.

581
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,768
那你呢，爸爸？

582
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:14,853
我？

00:47:30,495 --> 00:47:31,996
比那更好玩

590
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:33,747
为什么？

591
00:47:33,915 --> 00:47:37,751
查克奶酪游戏屋怎么样？
I don't know, maybe. . . Chuck E. Cheese?

592

596
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,763
包括妈妈的，因为她要减肥
Even Mommy's ,'cause she can't have carbs.

598
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:57,563
你现在不用担心这个

00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:42,115
那里太脏了，我不想在那方便
It's hella dirty in there,
I'm not gonna pee in there.

662
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,618
- 你一定很冷吧
- 我冷死了
- Now you have to be hella cold. . .
- I am hella cold.

663
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:47,496
你知道怎么做
And you know what's gonna happen.

664
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:54,044
- 我是年轻小伙
- 你是个绅士
- A young man right here.
- See? You are a gentleman.

665
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:57,923
他是绅士，这个手提包和你真配
He's a gentleman.
That purse looks real good on you, too.

666
00:53:58,091 --> 00:54:00,467
你拿着这个手提包真配
You look real good in that purse.

667
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:05,931
说什么呢，作为男友，这是我应该做的
What? Look, as a boyfriend,
it's what I gotta do.

668
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:21,655
- 我憋不住了
- 我知道
- I gotta pee so bad.
- I know, I know.

669
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,240
问问这家店
Ask the store right here.

670
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:25,701
你好，能让我们用下洗手间吗？
What's up, bruh?
You got a bathroom that we could use?

671
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:27,160
我已经关门了
I'm all closed up, man.

672
00:54:27,328 --> 00:54:29,454
我也没有供顾客使用的洗手间
And I don't even have
a bathroom for my customers.

673
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:32,499
你一定有供店员使用的洗手间吧？
But I'm sure you got a bathroom
for your employees, right?

674
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:38,880
我也没多少钱，明白我意思吗？
Say, bruh, I ain't rich at all,
you feelin' me?

675
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:40,882
这是我最后十块钱
Here's my last ten dollars.

676
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,343
要么你收下这十块，让他们用下洗手间
Now, you can take this ten,
let them use the bathroom,

677
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:45,095
要么你回家
or you can go home.

678
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:47,764
等你明天来时，这儿一定到处是小便
When you come back tomorrow,
there's gonna be hella piss here

679
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:50,767
她们总不能尿裤子里吧？
'cause they ain't gonna pee
on themselves, you feelin' me?

680
00:54:52,145 --> 00:54:54,479
真的？
For real?

681
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:57,274
看看她
Look at her.

682
00:54:57,442 --> 00:55:00,444
- 就这两位女士？
- 就这两位女士
- Just these two girls?
- Just these two girls.

683
00:55:03,114 --> 00:55:04,865
去吧，小心脚下
OK, come on in. Just watch your step.

684
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:06,658
谢谢
Thank you.

685
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,915
不用了，新年快乐
Don't worry about it, man.
Happy New Year.

686
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,043
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

687
00:55:27,055 --> 00:55:29,848
这儿一定有洗手间吧
Please tell me this place has a bathroom.

688
00:55:37,857 --> 00:55:39,316
怎么了？
What?

689
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:43,153
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

690
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:46,239
- 进来吧
- 谢谢
- OK, come on.
- Thank you.

691
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:47,657
- 谢谢你
- 不用谢
- Thank you.
- No problem.

692
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:50,202
- 不能再来人了
- 没问题
- No more.
- That's it.

693
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:52,287
保证是最后一个
Promise, last one.

694
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:54,122
- 多谢
- 不用谢
- Thanks a lot, man.
- No problem.

695
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,916
- 非常感激
- 没事
- Appreciate that.
- Yep.

696
00:55:56,084 --> 00:55:58,293
还以为她只能在大街上解决
Thought she was gonna
have to go in the street.

697
00:55:58,461 --> 00:56:00,295
我们也差不多
We almost had the same problem.

698
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:09,513
你们结婚多久了？
How long you guys been married?

699
00:56:12,642 --> 00:56:14,392
八年
Eight years.

700
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:21,233
你打算结婚？
You thinkin' about it?

701
00:56:24,362 --> 00:56:26,154
是什么在阻挠你？
What's stopping you?

702
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:31,284
- 没钱
- 很烂的理由
- No money.
- Ah, shitty reason.

703
00:56:33,162 --> 00:56:36,998
- 我们结婚时一无所有
- 开什么玩笑？
- We had nothing when we got married.
- No shit?

704
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,543
我当时没工作，她是个老师
I wasn't working at all,and she's a teacher,

705
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,461
不过她挣的钱也不多
it's practically the same thing,
as far as money goes.

706
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:43,672
婚戒哪来的？
How'd you get a ring?

707
00:56:46,217 --> 00:56:48,301
我偷的
I stole it.

708
00:56:50,054 --> 00:56:53,849
说了我没钱，过去靠信用卡过活
Told you, I didn't have any money.
Used to be good with credit cards.

709
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:57,853
- 我不想再这样下去
- 我理解
- I would not go down that road.
- No, bruh. I'm cool on that.

710
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,856
之后我的生意开始有点起色
Seriously, but then
I got my business started,

711
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:03,233
送了她现在戴着那只戒指
got her the ring she wears now.

712
00:57:05,236 --> 00:57:08,864
- 你做哪一行？
- 网页设计公司
- What do you do?
- Got a Web design company.

713
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:11,533
如果你有需要就打电话给我
Hit me up if you ever need anything.

714
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,745
- 皮特？
- 没错

722
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:32,012

我们走吧
Yeah, man, we gotta get out!

726
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:44,816
- 别废话了
- 走吧
- Now you're talkin' about shit, man.

00:57:44,984 --> 00:57:46,776

奥斯卡，帕尔马那鬼地方来的？
Oscar? Oscar from fuckin' Palma Ceia?

740
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:51,776

列车上有人打架

参与打架的人马上下车
If you were involved in the
fight, get off the fuckin' train now!

762
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:12,232
别逼我进去揪你出来
Don't make me come in there and pull you off!

You arrestin' us?

我一直这么解释
That's what I've been
sayin' this whole time,

770
01:01:35,423 --> 01:01:36,798
但这个美臀警察就是不听

我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what friends
you talkin' about.

775
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:48,685
我看到了一个庞克族

站台需要支援

01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:13,835
你们不能这样

危险，什么意思？

947
01:12:04,092 --> 01:12:06,010
他大量内出血

948
01:12:06,178 --> 01:12:08,512
我们必须切除他的右肺

949
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,516
切肺，那他以后怎么呼吸？

他现在靠呼吸机

他的呼吸很稳定

952
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:19,815
主要的问题是内出血

953
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:21,692
操
Damn. . .

01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:26,864
我们很难让血止住
Now, we've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding,and getting his blood to clot.

He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions yet.

956
