生活大爆炸
第七季  第九集

5
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,630
我们用数学算过了
The math is all there.

6
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,410
-这不可能  -的确可能
- It's not real. - Yes, it is.

7
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,740
好吧  听着
Yeah... uh, look.

8
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
从科学角度上来说  单凭一人之力
It is scientifically impossible

9
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,640
不可能从侧面将牛推倒
for a person to tip a cow.

10
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,640
Tip a cow over是指在牛站着睡觉的时候悄悄走到旁边
将其推倒取乐的一种活动

11
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,610
就连你这个虎背熊腰的女汉子
Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders,

12
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,000
也不可能做到
you couldn't do it.

13
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,710
太可怕了  你为什么要把牛推到
It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over?

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,740
它们多神圣啊
They're sacred.

15
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,740
印度人敬牛如敬神

16
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,590
少来了
Oh, stop it.

17
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,700
我都见你吃过不下一百万个牛肉汉堡了
I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.

18
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,080
动物可以集神圣和美味于一身
Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.

19
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,170
告诉你们  我的确把牛推倒过
Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?

20
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,360
我清楚地记得牛先是站着的
I clearly remember the cow standing up

21
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,850
然后就倒到一侧了
and then the cow on its side.

22
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,770
你是不是喝醉了
Were you drunk?

23
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,960
我当时是内布拉斯加州的16岁少女  你觉得呢
I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,990
我觉得你才是倒下的那个
I think you're the one who fell over.

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,930
怪不得当时天空也也倒在一侧
That would explain why the sky was also on its side.

26
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,610
霍华德  "推牛倒"是真的还是假的
Howard. Cow tipping: real or not?

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
我觉得是  假的
I'm gonna say... not.

28
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,400
因为我曾试过在我妈打鼾时让她翻身
That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over

29
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,230
可死都推不动她
when she's snoring.

30
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,980
说到大块的肉
Speaking of that big side of beef,

31
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,840
她邀请你们去她家过感恩节
uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.

32
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,510
有人跟我说  赤裸裸地拒绝别人的邀请
You know, I've been told that a bald refusal

33
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,150
是很无礼的
of an invitation is rude

34
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,570
所以必须编造一个礼貌的借口来回绝
and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so...

35
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,450
我也很想去  但不幸的是
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

36
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,200
那听起来很可怕
that sounds awful.

37
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,130
去嘛  一点都不可怕
Come on, it'll be fun.

38
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,770
我们其实打算在这里过
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,210
拜托啦  伯纳黛特的妈妈不在家
Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad

40
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,260
所以她会带她爸来
'cause her mom's out of town,

41
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,310
可我跟他爸总是话不投机
and I never have anything to say to that guy.

42
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,580
既然你都这么说了  我也想帮你
Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,

43
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,700
但那听起来更可怕了
but that sounds even more awful.

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,950
其实不用一天都听
It'd actually be nice to not hear

45
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,980
谢尔顿抱怨我的厨艺挺好的
Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.

46
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,700
什么  不好意思
Yo... uh, excuse me,

47
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,220
但每年你的菜都做得难吃
but every year you prepare a terrible meal

48
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,250
我每年都批评你的厨艺
and every year I criticize it.

49
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,050
难道我们的传统对你来说毫无意义吗
Do our traditions mean nothing to you?

50
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,500
-我想去  -我也是
- I want to go. - Yeah, me, too.

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,960
-我也去  -谢尔顿
- I'm in. - Sheldon.

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,530
好吧  我去
Ugh, fine, I'll go.

53
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,780
但如果菜都很好吃  那感恩节就被毁了
But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,190
这笔账算你的
and it's on you.

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,970
我们真的要去沃罗威茨夫人家吃饭吗
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,120
是的
We do.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,660
我希望你的行为举止要得当
And I expect you to be on your best behavior.

58
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,430
现在我了解非洲黑奴当时的感受了
Now I know how the African slaves felt.

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,520
被人强行从自己家园拖出
Being dragged from their homes

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,320
沦为受白人控制和使唤的劳力
to labor under the yoke of the white man.

61
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,100
你真的要把
Are you honestly comparing

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,340
去沃罗威茨妈妈家吃饭
Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,810
和人类历史上最大的悲剧之一
with one of the greatest tragedies

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,050
这两件事相提并论吗
in the history of mankind?

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,810
是的
Yes.

66
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,880
谢尔顿  不管在哪里都可以过个开心的感恩节
Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,430
我就在维加斯试过
I spent one in Vegas.

68
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,260
是吗
You did?

69
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,900
对啊  当时我在跟扎克约会
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,670
那个感恩节比我想象中有趣多了
It was actually more fun than I thought.

71
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,490
我们先去赌博  然后去了一家低档的婚礼教堂
We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels,

72
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,840
我们还吃了一顿超美味的火鸡大餐
we had a really good turkey dinner.

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,400
真的想不到这么好吃  因为我们是在脱衣舞俱乐部
Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,990
慢着  你们俩还去教堂了吗
Wait, you went to a chapel?

75
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,540
-是啊  -去干嘛
- Yeah. - Why?

76
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,010
我们不过是办了一场假婚礼
We had one of those silly fake weddings.

77
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,780
拉斯维加斯办理结婚无需繁琐的手续 
只要新郎新娘两个人说"我愿意"就可以

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,070
佩妮
Penny...

79
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,810
你知道那是真结婚  对吧
you know those are real, right?

80
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,600
不  是假结婚
No, they're not.

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,490
是真的
Yeah, they are.

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,110
是假的
No, they're not.

83
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,030
是真的
Yeah, they are.

84
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,950
-他说得对  -是真的
- He's right. - They're real.

85
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,570
但那看上去不像真的呀
But it... didn't seem real.

86
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,280
我问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,750
有没可能  当时你眼中的拉斯维加斯是倒在一侧的呢
At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?

88
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,690
-爸爸  -乖宝贝
- Hi, Dad. - Hi, honey.

89
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,140
你还给大家买了啤酒啊
Oh, you brought beer for everybody.

90
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,910
好吧  没错  人人都有份
Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.

91
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,150
我真是只想今天安静地在家待着
I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,530
看看比赛
and watch the game.

93
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,970
你在这里也能安静待着看比赛啊
You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.

94
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,730
霍华德  那药不管用
Howard, the medicine's not working!

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,530
你刚吃了没多久
You just took it.

96
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,730
至少等它先到达你第一个胃再说
At least let it reach your first stomach!

97
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,730
迈克  来了啊
Hey, Mike.

98
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,880
-我来帮你拿吧  -谢谢
- Let me help you out, there. - Thanks.

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
你妈妈怎么了
What's wrong with your mom?

100
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,630
她的痛风加重了
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

101
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,070
看来一天一个苹果派  
Turns out an apple pie a day

102
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,040
并不能让你远离疾病
does not keep the doctor away.

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,570
为什么我的小脚趾这么疼呢
How can one little toe hurt so bad?

104
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,330
或许是因为那只小脚趾
Maybe because that little piggy

105
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,760
被你的庞大的身躯压碎了
is being crushed by the barn!

106
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,820
她很快就会安静下来
She should quiet down soon.

107
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,640
我给她的止痛药足以让一头...
I gave her enough pain meds to choke a...

108
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
让她安静下来
well, her.

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,560
我们得开始做饭了
I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.

110
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,500
我有个更好的主意
I have a better idea.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,610
如果你想让我一个人干所有的活
If you think you're gonna make me do all this by myself,

112
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,510
那绝对不行
you're crazy.

113
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,160
我是想让拉杰一个人干所有的活
I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,090
那真是个好主意
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,150
路上没车  真是一帆风顺啊
No traffic, we're sailing.

116
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,920
是啊
Yes.

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,870
好像我们在船上一样
Like we're on a ship.

118
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,740
一艘从非洲到美国的船
Coming from Africa to America.

119
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,230
谢尔顿  这样做太不恰当了
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate.

120
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,590
你不能一直将自己比作奴隶
You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.

121
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,150
是的  艾米小姐
Yes, Miss Amy.

122
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,540
真不敢相信你居然跟那个傻蛋结婚了
I can't believe you're married to that idiot.

123
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,690
别说了行吗  我们只是闹着玩的
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.

124
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,340
不管是不是闹着玩  你们都是真结婚了
Well, a goof or not, you're actually married.

125
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,300
-你得解决这件事  -我会的
- You need to get this taken care of. - I will.

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
你干嘛在这件事上小题大作
Why are you making this such a big deal?

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,090
我知道原因
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

128
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,200
可能是因为你愿意嫁给扎克
It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack,

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,760
而每次莱纳德向你求婚时
but every time Leonard's proposed,

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,940
你总是拒绝他
he's gotten a resounding no.

131
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,740
我一下子就想到这个答案了
Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.

132
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,420
那我该怎么办
So how do I undo this?

133
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,000
我希望你能解除婚约
I'm hoping you can get an annulment.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,390
就好像这事从来没发生过
It's just like it never happened.

135
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,020
好啊  那我应该怎么做
Great, well, what do I have to do?

136
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,560
从法律上说  解除婚约
It says here you can get an annulment

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,500
必须满足一下任何一个条件
if any of the following conditions are met.

138
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,860
"婚后  两人从未圆房"
"Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,990
佩妮是欲女  下一条
Penny? Next.

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,000
"两人间存在欺骗  重婚
"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy,

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
缺乏谅解"
want of understanding?"

142
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
到底什么是"缺乏谅解[理解力]"
"Want of understanding?" What does that even mean?

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,160
叮叮叮  说的就是你
Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.

144
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,580
谢谢你救我于水火之中
Thanks for saving the day.

145
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,600
不用谢
Ah, no problem.

146
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,360
美国的第一个感恩节是印第安人与新移民第一次齐聚感谢上天赐予
并感谢印第安人曾在危急的时刻送来食物和帮助他们

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,650
没有印第安人[印度人]献上美食
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

148
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,360
就不算是真正的感恩节
without an Indian providing the food.

149
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,100
你妈妈把植物奶油放哪里了
Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?

150
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,930
我不知道
Um, I don't know.

151
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,080
大概是塞在她脸颊的肥肉里了
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

152
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,520
我在这里帮拉杰 
I'll help Raj in here.

153
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,270
你出去陪我爸爸好吗 
Why don't you go keep my dad company?

154
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,490
他可不想我陪他
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.

155
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,730
我在他眼中是  睡了他乖女儿的讨厌鬼
I'm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.

156
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,970
-别傻了  他喜欢你  -真的吗
- Don't be silly, he loves you. - Does he?

157
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,430
-好吧  至少他关心你啊  -真的吗
- Okay, he cares about you a lot. - Really?

158
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,720
老娘不也经常为你做牛做马  快滚出去
I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.

159
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,530
你太太和孙子们一起待在亚利桑那吗
So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?

160
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,000
我妈妈也去过亚利桑那州
You know, my mom's been to...Arizona.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,180
她骑着一头骡子穿越大峡谷
She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon.

162
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,450
最后为了让骡子落个安乐死  人们把它射死了
Long story short, they had to shoot it.

163
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,370
因为我妈实在太胖了
'Cause she's so fat.

164
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,290
您慢慢笑  我去开门
I'll get the door while you finish laughing.

165
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,420
大家好
Hey, guys.

166
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,630
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

167
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,240
闻起来真香啊
It smells wonderful.

168
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,550
是谁在厨房做苦力
Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen?

169
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,990
-因为我也...  -谢尔顿
- Because I, too, know... - Sheldon.

170
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
给你  谢谢你邀请我们
Here. Thank you for having us.

171
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,040
-你怎么了  -她在生我的气
- What's with you? - Oh, she's mad at me

172
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,900
因为她刚发现她和扎克结婚了
because she just found out she's married to Zack.

173
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,670
真的吗
Really?

174
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,750
那个和她约会过的傻蛋吗
That dumb-ass she used to date?

175
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,940
这也太搞笑了
That's hysterical.

176
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,930
亏我还为在车里打开了这酒而自责
I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

177
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,020
-你俩要帮忙吗  -好呀  
- You need any help? - Uh, yeah,

178
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,240
你能拿一下上面的酱汁碗吗
can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,710
-没问题  -太好了
- Uh, sure. - Great.

180
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,580
至少你俩还有人能够得着
That makes one of you.

181
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,690
我们任务重大  时间却很紧迫
Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it.

182
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,130
伯纳黛特  你负责玉米  肉酱汁和红薯
Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail.

183
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,670
艾米  你负责面包卷  蔓越莓
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

184
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,400
并且确保不让伯纳黛特靠近棉花糖
and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.

185
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,250
没错  我看见你偷吃了
That's right, I see you.

186
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,030
如果有问题要问
Okay, if you have any questions,

187
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,830
我就在这里  专心地给烤肉刷油
I'll be over here basting my ass off.

188
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,900
集中注意力是关键
Focus is key.

189
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,220
你们知道佩妮和扎克三年前就结婚了吗
Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?

190
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,970
-什么  -啥
- What? - Wha...?

191
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,070
你打过橄榄球吗
You ever play football?

192
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,830
大学时玩过一点
A little in college.

193
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,450
-你呢  -没玩过
- You? - No.

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,510
不过我曾经作为球  被人在走廊阻截过一次
But I did get tackled in the hallway once.

195
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,420
整个学校欢声雷动啊
The whole school cheered.

196
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,740
我找到了你和扎克
Hey, I found the, uh, court papers

197
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,840
需要填写的法庭文件
that you and Zack need to fill out.

198
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
-等我回家就打印出来  -行
- I'll print them when we get home. - Fine.

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,630
然后我们就可以彻底忘掉这事了
And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

200
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,270
-你有完没完  -怎么了  
- Are you done? - What?

201
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,480
我知道  我做错了
Look, I get it, I screwed up.

202
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,020
难道今天剩下的时间  你都要提起这件事吗
Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?

203
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
你对我凶什么呀
Why are you mad at me?

204
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,380
明明是你做了蠢事
You're the one that did the stupid thing.

205
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,520
而我只是帮你解决而已
I'm just trying to fix it.

206
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,270
我需要呼吸点新鲜空气
I need some air.

207
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,160
那个...佩妮
Well... Penny.

208
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,330
我虽然完全不了解女人
Now, I don't know the first thing about women,

209
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,420
但我要是你  我就不会跟出去
but I would not follow her.

210
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,900
听瘦高个的话没错
Listen to Stretch.

211
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,600
怎么成了我的错了
How am I the bad guy?

212
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,380
是她乱嫁人  我是受害者好吗
She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.

213
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,560
扎克才是受害者吧  
Sounds like Zack's the victim.

214
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
你睡了人家老婆 
You're sleeping with his wife.

215
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,190
我的婚姻35年来一直幸福和睦
I've kept my marriage together for 35 years.

216
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,830
我能给点建议吗
Can I weigh in here?

217
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,750
好呀
Sure.

218
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,170
我正在看比赛呢  闭嘴
I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.

219
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,740
怎么会错过第一次进攻呢
How do you not make a first down there?

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,770
人家用了五个后卫  他们还敢传球
They passed against a nickel defense.

221
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,650
应该采取摆脱拦截才对
They should have run it off-tackle.

222
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,110
你怎么会看球
How the hell do you know that?

223
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,790
我爸爱死橄榄球了
My father loved football.

224
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,090
他总是强迫我一起看
He always made me watch it

225
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,610
不看完不准做作业
before I was allowed to do my homework.

226
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,620
你高兴了吧  我刚打电话给扎克了  
Well, you'll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack

227
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,330
他会签那些文件的
and he's willing to sign the court papers.

228
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,680
他马上就过来
He's on his way here now.

229
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
-等等  你居然让他来这  -是呀
- Wait, you invited him here? - Yeah.

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,230
我准备再次发表建议了
I'm getting ready to weigh in again.

231
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,810
过来
Come on.

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,470
你觉得他们现在应该怎么做
What do you think they ought to do now?

233
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,710
我会快速斜向往球场内出发  扔球给外接手
I would throw a quick slant to a wideout,

234
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,790
因为防守线卫似乎要向传球员突袭了
given that the defense is showing blitz.

235
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,350
我最喜欢薄饼卷了
Oh, I love a good blitz,

236
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,660
尤其是加酸奶油的那种 
especially with sour cream.

237
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,950
懂我笑点吗
Get it?

238
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,460
因为这两者音很近啊
'Cause it sounds like "Blintz."

239
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,250
刚有人说"薄饼卷"吗
Did someone say "Blintz"?!

240
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,270
我不明白你为什么非得今天把他叫来
I just don't understand why you invited him here today.

241
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,990
因为你唠叨个没完
Because you wouldn't shut up about it.

242
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,280
我打给他时  他反正也没事干
When I called him, he had nothing to do,

243
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,270
所以我就想...
so I just thought it would...

244
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,850
两位  我在里面做饭呢
Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.

245
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,060
抱歉  我们会小点声的
Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.

246
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,490
不  大声点
No, no, speak up.

247
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,120
我要用搅拌器了
I'm about to use the blender,

248
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,830
可我一句也不想漏掉
and I don't want to miss anything.

249
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,900
你要多准备一人份的食物了
Well, you might have to cook for one more

250
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,460
因为她邀请了扎克过来
because she invited Zack.

251
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,140
-什么  -哇哦
- What? - Ooh!

252
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,870
我的天
My, my.

253
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,630
故事发展如同我的肉汁  越加复杂[浓厚]了
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

254
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,610
我不喜欢你妈的卫生间
I don't care for your mother's bathroom.

255
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,430
不管你面朝哪边尿尿
There's not an angle to do one's business

256
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,270
都有一个小丑雕像瞪着你
without a clown figurine staring at you.

257
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,030
所以我才坐着尿
That's why I sit.

258
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,860
没错  所以你才不爷们
Yeah, that's why.

259
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,910
你还记得达拉斯下大雪的
You remember the Thanksgiving game

260
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,900
那次感恩节比赛吗
when it snowed in Dallas?

261
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,350
1993年  
1993--

262
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,400
里昂・莱特在最后几秒犯了错
Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds

263
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,440
海豚队取得了胜利
and the Dolphins emerged victorious.

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,670
于是我终于能做我的微积分题了
Then I finally got to do my calculus.

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,810
我当时气疯了  差点没一枪崩了电视
I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.

266
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,330
我爸也是
So was my dad.

267
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,010
他真的开了枪
And then he did.

268
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,090
-有人还要啤酒吗  -我要
- Anyone need a beer?-  Yeah.

269
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
谢天谢地
Thank God.

270
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,250
你爸爸还住在德克萨斯吗
So, does your dad still live in Texas?

271
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,300
不  我十四岁时他就死了
No. He died when I was 14.

272
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,700
真是太遗憾了
I'm sorry to hear that.

273
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,380
本地酒店的老板也很遗憾
So was the man who owned the local liquor store.

274
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,550
他泣不成声  痛哭流涕
He cried and cried.

275
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,810
啤酒来了
Here you go.

276
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,400
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

277
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,690
既然你爸在你十四岁就过世了
So, if your dad died when you were 14,

278
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,780
你肯定没机会和他一起喝啤酒吧
you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.

279
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,020
是的  先生
No, sir.

280
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,760
我高中毕业时他想跟我喝一罐
He did try to give me one for my high school graduation,

281
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,740
但我才11岁  我妈妈说不行
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

282
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,850
那你就跟我喝一罐吧
Well, you're having one with me.

283
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,910
好的
All right.

284
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
敬你的父亲
To your dad.

285
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,750
我也从来没和我爸喝过啤酒
I never had a beer with my dad, either.

286
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,000
能别插嘴吗  我们喝得正欢呢
Do you mind? We're having a moment here.

287
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,990
真不敢相信佩妮嫁给了扎克
I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.

288
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,050
不知道她看上他哪一点
Wonder what she saw in that guy.

289
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,800
不知道
I don't know.

290
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,380
他可爱  高大  英俊
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

291
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,240
他有宽阔的肩膀  浓密的头发
Broad shoulders, good hair.

292
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,550
不知道她看上莱纳德哪一点
Wonder what she sees in Leonard.

293
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,680
外面情况如何
How's it going out there?

294
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,610
谢尔顿和你爸把酒言欢
Sheldon and your dad are bonding

295
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,450
完全无视我的存在
and completely ignoring me.

296
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,030
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel.

297
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,640
他买了智能吸尘器后  无视了我一周
Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.

298
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,820
趁他不注意的时候  我踢了那玩意一脚
I kick it when he's not looking.

299
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,380
他们在做什么
What are they doing?

300
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,070
喝啤酒  看橄榄球比赛
They're drinking beer and watching football.

301
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,550
你就和他们一起呗
So why don't do that with them.

302
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,100
他们不要我
They don't want me.

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,040
什么意思
What do you mean?

304
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,640
谢尔顿开始诉说他的父亲已经不在人世了
Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

305
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,500
在他们碰杯时  我试图告诉他们
and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about

306
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,620
我父亲抛弃我们时  我有多难过
how sad I was when my dad abandoned...

307
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,820
扎克到了
Zack's here!

308
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,190
搅拌肉汁
Stir the gravy.

309
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,160
对不起  我真的很想听你有多难过
Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are.

310
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,000
五到十分钟后  我就会回来了
I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.

311
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,460
抱歉今天过节  她还让你过来
Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.

312
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,380
没关系  反正我也没安排
It's all right. I didn't have anything going on.

313
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,740
而且  佩妮说我们结婚了
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

314
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,380
感恩节就是要和家人一起
and Thanksgiving's a time to be with family.

315
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,700
非常好
Yeah, okay, great.

316
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,740
咱们速战速决吧
Can we just get this over with?

317
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,830
好  在这里和这里签名
Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here.

318
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,590
星期一  我们会提出无效申请
On Monday, we'll file for the annulment,

319
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,460
这段婚姻就结束了
and this "Marriage" will be over.

320
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,840
好了
Okay.

321
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,430
我不确定我是否想签这份文件
I don't know if I want to sign it.

322
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,740
你为什么不想签
Why won't you sign it?

323
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,610
我只是觉得分手对孩子影响不好
I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.

324
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,550
我们没有孩子
We don't have any kids.

325
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
你确定吗  你也是
Are you sure? 'Cause you didn't know

326
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,240
今早才知道我们结婚了
we were married until this morning.

327
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,690
扎克  拜托
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

328
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,790
我们都知道那场婚礼不是真的
You know neither of us thought this was real.

329
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,240
主婚人是山寨猫王
I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.

330
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,950
当然是山寨的了
Of course it was an impersonator.

331
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,290
真的猫王我们请不起好吧
We could never afford a real Elvis.

332
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,760
你居然嫁给他  不嫁给我
You married him instead of me?

333
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
真有眼光
Good call.

334
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,170
快签字
Sign the papers.

335
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,550
慢着  算了
Hang on. You know what?

336
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,360
你一整天都是一副欠揍的态度
You have been a jerk about this all day.

337
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,800
你总是这样  每次我犯了错
You always do this-- whenever I mess up,

338
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
你就在旁边数落我  让我感觉更难受
you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.

339
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,550
才不是
That is not true.

340
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,500
我们本可以等到周一  再签文件
Yeah, we could've waited till Monday, signed the papers,

341
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,470
这事就算过去了
this all would have been over.

342
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,590
是你把他叫过来的
You're the one who invited him here.

343
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,660
你又来了  
Oh, there you go again--

344
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,840
又开始当着我的面数落我的错误
just another mistake you're throwing in my face.

345
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,730
这可不好  兄弟
Not cool, bro.

346
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,910
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

347
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,570
我不想我老婆跟你这种人约会
you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.

348
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,030
好吧
Yeah, well,

349
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,940
她做你老婆的时间不会很久了
she's not gonna be your wife for long.

350
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,680
不是吧  你快死了吗
Oh, no. Are you dying?

351
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,390
快了  快签字吧
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

352
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,610
常言说得好  老婆开心  
Know what they say: "Happy wife,

353
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,750
日子舒心   
happy life."

354
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,920
开吃吧
Let's eat.

355
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,040
二  三  八  四  六
Two, three, eight, four, six.

356
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,500
再说就要吐了
That's all I can do without throwing up.

357
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,410
我可没料到
That is not what I expected

358
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,260
你说打嗝说出π[馅饼]是这个意思
when you said you were gonna burp "Pie."

359
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,740
谢尔顿已经背到π的小数点后第20位
3. 14159 26535 89793 23846

360
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
刚有人说"馅饼"吗
Did somebody say "Pie"?!

361
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,260
我不知道哪种更吓人
I don't know what's scarier:

362
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,680
厕所小丑
the bathroom clowns

363
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,670
还是把小丑放进去的女人
or the woman that put them there.

364
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,640
我只知道  车上只能放下一个她
All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.

365
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,310
那是从她身体里蹦出来的小丑
And there's the clown that came out of her.

366
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,530
我之前真的不想来
I really didn't want to come here,

367
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,050
但看来这次感恩节
but this is shaping up to be

368
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,890
是我多年以来过得最开心的一次
one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.

369
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,080
我也是
Me, too.

370
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,940
喂  华仔说你们一整天都在取笑他
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day!

371
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,580
现在你们两个马上道歉
Now, both of you apologize right now!

372
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,600
她个子好小啊
She's so tiny.

373
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,040
她生气的样子好好笑
It's funny when she's mad.

374
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,380
小伙子  
All right, mister,

375
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,240
我想你应该向霍华德和伯纳黛特道歉
I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.

376
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,260
也许你是对的
Perhaps you're right.

377
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,650
我为我的行为道歉
I'm sorry for my behavior.

378
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,890
我摄入了酒精  导致我行为不当
I've had alcohol, and it's caused me to be inappropriate.

379
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,610
-没事  -没关系
- It's okay. - Don't worry about it.

380
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,050
谢谢
Thank you.

381
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,190
她是不是好贤惠
Ain't she great?

382
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,600
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

383
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
快去给老爷们儿拿啤酒吧
Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?

384
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,440
再次感谢你下厨
Thanks again for cooking.

385
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,800
所有菜都超级好吃
Yeah, everything was delicious.

386
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,220
没我最喜欢的两个女生帮忙  我也做不到啊
Well, I couldn't have done it without my two favorite girls.

387
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,440
玛莎・斯图尔特和瑞秋・雷[厨艺天后]
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

388
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,810
谢尔顿  我们出去
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside

389
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,150
玩下橄榄球如何[猪皮]
and throw around the old pigskin?

390
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,430
这家是犹太人
This is a Jewish house.

391
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,430
犹太人不吃猪肉

392
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,610
我想他们没猪皮
I don't think they have pigskin.

393
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,760
刚有人说"猪皮"吗
Did someone say pigskin!

394
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,540
亲爱的  今天的事很抱歉
Hey, honey, I'm sorry about today.

395
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,240
我保证  下次结婚
And I promise, next time I get married,

396
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,690
绝对不会是闹着玩
it won't be a joke.

397
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,550
一定是为了爱
It'll be for love.

398
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,180
或是钱
Or money.

399
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,740
我也抱歉
I'm sorry, too.

400
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,270
别这样
Don't be.

401
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,300
都是我的错
It's my fault.

402
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,750
我是个糟糕的老公
I was a terrible husband.

403
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,290
从未陪在老婆身边
I was never around.

404
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,780
我知道我对你太严厉了
I know I'm hard on you,

405
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,680
但你不是世界上最差劲的女婿
but you're not the worst son-in-law in the world.

406
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,110
迈克  这是你对我说过的最贴心的话
Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

407
