1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,630
The math is all there.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,410
- It's not real. - Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,740
Yeah... uh, look.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
It is scientifically impossible

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,640
for a person to tip a cow.

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,610
Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders,

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,000
you couldn't do it.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,710
It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over?

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,740
They're sacred.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,590
Oh, stop it.

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,700
I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,080
Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,170
Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,360
I clearly remember the cow standing up

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,850
and then the cow on its side.

16
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,770
Were you drunk?

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,960
I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,990
I think you're the one who fell over.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,930
That would explain why the sky was also on its side.

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,610
Howard. Cow tipping: real or not?

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm gonna say... not.

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,400
That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,230
when she's snoring.

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,980
Speaking of that big side of beef,

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,840
uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,510
You know, I've been told that a bald refusal

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,150
of an invitation is rude

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,570
and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so...

29
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,450
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,200
that sounds awful.

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,130
Come on, it'll be fun.

32
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,770
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,210
Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad

34
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,260
'cause her mom's out of town,

35
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,310
and I never have anything to say to that guy.

36
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,580
Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,700
but that sounds even more awful.

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,950
It'd actually be nice to not hear

39
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,980
Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.

40
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,700
Yo... uh, excuse me,

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,220
but every year you prepare a terrible meal

42
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,250
and every year I criticize it.

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,050
Do our traditions mean nothing to you?

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,500
- I want to go. - Yeah, me, too.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,960
- I'm in. - Sheldon.

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,530
Ugh, fine, I'll go.

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,780
But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,190
and it's on you.

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,970
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,120
We do.

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,660
And I expect you to be on your best behavior.

52
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,430
Now I know how the African slaves felt.

53
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,520
Being dragged from their homes

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,320
to labor under the yoke of the white man.

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,100
Are you honestly comparing

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,340
Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,810
with one of the greatest tragedies

58
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,050
in the history of mankind?

59
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,810
Yes.

60
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,880
Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,430
I spent one in Vegas.

62
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,260
You did?

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,900
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,670
It was actually more fun than I thought.

65
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,490
We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels,

66
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,840
we had a really good turkey dinner.

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,400
Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,990
Wait, you went to a chapel?

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,540
- Yeah. - Why?

70
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,010
We had one of those silly fake weddings.

71
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,070
Penny...

72
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,810
you know those are real, right?

73
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,600
No, they're not.

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,490
Yeah, they are.

75
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,110
No, they're not.

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,030
Yeah, they are.

77
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,950
- He's right. - They're real.

78
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,570
But it... didn't seem real.

79
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,280
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,750
At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?

81
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,690
- Hi, Dad. - Hi, honey.

82
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,140
Oh, you brought beer for everybody.

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,910
Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,150
I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home

85
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,530
and watch the game.

86
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,970
You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.

87
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,730
Howard, the medicine's not working!

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,530
You just took it.

89
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,730
At least let it reach your first stomach!

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,730
Hey, Mike.

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,880
- Let me help you out, there. - Thanks.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
What's wrong with your mom?

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,630
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

94
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,070
Turns out an apple pie a day

95
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,040
does not keep the doctor away.

96
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,570
How can one little toe hurt so bad?

97
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,330
Maybe because that little piggy

98
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,760
is being crushed by the barn!

99
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,820
She should quiet down soon.

100
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,640
I gave her enough pain meds to choke a...

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
well, her.

102
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,560
I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,500
I have a better idea.

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,610
If you think you're gonna make me do all this by myself,

105
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,510
you're crazy.

106
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,160
I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,090
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,150
No traffic, we're sailing.

109
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,870
Like we're on a ship.

111
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,740
Coming from Africa to America.

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,230
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate.

113
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,590
You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.

114
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,150
Yes, Miss Amy.

115
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,540
I can't believe you're married to that idiot.

116
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,690
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.

117
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,340
Well, a goof or not, you're actually married.

118
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,300
- You need to get this taken care of. - I will.

119
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
Why are you making this such a big deal?

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,090
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

121
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,200
It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack,

122
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,760
but every time Leonard's proposed,

123
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,940
he's gotten a resounding no.

124
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,740
Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.

125
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,420
So how do I undo this?

126
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm hoping you can get an annulment.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,390
It's just like it never happened.

128
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,020
Great, well, what do I have to do?

129
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,560
It says here you can get an annulment

130
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,500
if any of the following conditions are met.

131
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,860
"Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,990
Penny? Next.

133
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,000
"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy,

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
want of understanding?"

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
"Want of understanding?" What does that even mean?

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,160
Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,580
Thanks for saving the day.

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,600
Ah, no problem.

139
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,650
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

140
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,360
without an Indian providing the food.

141
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,100
Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?

142
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,930
Um, I don't know.

143
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,080
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

144
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll help Raj in here.

145
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,270
Why don't you go keep my dad company?

146
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,490
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.

147
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,730
I'm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.

148
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,970
- Don't be silly, he loves you. - Does he?

149
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,430
- Okay, he cares about you a lot. - Really?

150
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,720
I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.

151
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,530
So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?

152
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,000
You know, my mom's been to...Arizona.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,180
She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon.

154
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,450
Long story short, they had to shoot it.

155
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,370
'Cause she's so fat.

156
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,290
I'll get the door while you finish laughing.

157
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,420
Hey, guys.

158
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,630
Happy Thanksgiving.

159
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,240
It smells wonderful.

160
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,550
Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen?

161
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,990
- Because I, too, know... - Sheldon.

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
Here. Thank you for having us.

163
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,040
- What's with you? - Oh, she's mad at me

164
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,900
because she just found out she's married to Zack.

165
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,670
Really?

166
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,750
That dumb-ass she used to date?

167
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,940
That's hysterical.

168
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,930
I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

169
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,020
- You need any help? - Uh, yeah,

170
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,240
can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?

171
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,710
- Uh, sure. - Great.

172
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,580
That makes one of you.

173
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,690
Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it.

174
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,130
Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail.

175
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,670
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

176
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,400
and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.

177
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,250
That's right, I see you.

178
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,030
Okay, if you have any questions,

179
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,830
I'll be over here basting my ass off.

180
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,900
Focus is key.

181
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,220
Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?

182
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,970
- What? - Wha...?

183
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,070
You ever play football?

184
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,830
A little in college.

185
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,450
- You? - No.

186
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,510
But I did get tackled in the hallway once.

187
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,420
The whole school cheered.

188
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,740
Hey, I found the, uh, court papers

189
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,840
that you and Zack need to fill out.

190
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
- I'll print them when we get home. - Fine.

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,630
And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

192
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,270
- Are you done? - What?

193
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,480
Look, I get it, I screwed up.

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,020
Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?

195
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
Why are you mad at me?

196
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,380
You're the one that did the stupid thing.

197
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm just trying to fix it.

198
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,270
I need some air.

199
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,160
Well... Penny.

200
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,330
Now, I don't know the first thing about women,

201
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,420
but I would not follow her.

202
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,900
Listen to Stretch.

203
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,600
How am I the bad guy?

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,380
She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.

205
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,560
Sounds like Zack's the victim.

206
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
You're sleeping with his wife.

207
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,190
I've kept my marriage together for 35 years.

208
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,830
Can I weigh in here?

209
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,750
Sure.

210
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,170
I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.

211
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,740
How do you not make a first down there?

212
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,770
They passed against a nickel defense.

213
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,650
They should have run it off-tackle.

214
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,110
How the hell do you know that?

215
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,790
My father loved football.

216
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,090
He always made me watch it

217
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,610
before I was allowed to do my homework.

218
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,620
Well, you'll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack

219
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,330
and he's willing to sign the court papers.

220
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,680
He's on his way here now.

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
- Wait, you invited him here? - Yeah.

222
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,230
I'm getting ready to weigh in again.

223
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,810
Come on.

224
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,470
What do you think they ought to do now?

225
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,710
I would throw a quick slant to a wideout,

226
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,790
given that the defense is showing blitz.

227
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,350
Oh, I love a good blitz,

228
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,660
especially with sour cream.

229
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,950
Get it?

230
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,460
'Cause it sounds like "Blintz."

231
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,250
Did someone say "Blintz"?!

232
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,270
I just don't understand why you invited him here today.

233
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,990
Because you wouldn't shut up about it.

234
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,280
When I called him, he had nothing to do,

235
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,270
so I just thought it would...

236
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,850
Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.

237
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,060
Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.

238
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,490
No, no, speak up.

239
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,120
I'm about to use the blender,

240
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,830
and I don't want to miss anything.

241
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,900
Well, you might have to cook for one more

242
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,460
because she invited Zack.

243
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,140
- What? - Ooh!

244
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,870
My, my.

245
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,630
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

246
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,610
I don't care for your mother's bathroom.

247
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,430
There's not an angle to do one's business

248
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,270
without a clown figurine staring at you.

249
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,030
That's why I sit.

250
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,860
Yeah, that's why.

251
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,910
You remember the Thanksgiving game

252
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,900
when it snowed in Dallas?

253
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,350
1993--

254
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,400
Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds

255
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,440
and the Dolphins emerged victorious.

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,670
Then I finally got to do my calculus.

257
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,810
I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.

258
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,330
So was my dad.

259
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,010
And then he did.

260
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,090
- Anyone need a beer?-  Yeah.

261
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
Thank God.

262
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,250
So, does your dad still live in Texas?

263
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,300
No. He died when I was 14.

264
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,700
I'm sorry to hear that.

265
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,380
So was the man who owned the local liquor store.

266
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,550
He cried and cried.

267
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,810
Here you go.

268
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,400
Oh, thanks.

269
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,690
So, if your dad died when you were 14,

270
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,780
you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.

271
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,020
No, sir.

272
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,760
He did try to give me one for my high school graduation,

273
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,740
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

274
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,850
Well, you're having one with me.

275
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,910
All right.

276
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
To your dad.

277
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,750
I never had a beer with my dad, either.

278
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you mind? We're having a moment here.

279
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,990
I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.

280
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,050
Wonder what she saw in that guy.

281
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,800
I don't know.

282
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,380
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

283
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,240
Broad shoulders, good hair.

284
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,550
Wonder what she sees in Leonard.

285
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,680
How's it going out there?

286
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,610
Sheldon and your dad are bonding

287
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,450
and completely ignoring me.

288
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,030
I know how you feel.

289
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,640
Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.

290
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,820
I kick it when he's not looking.

291
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,380
What are they doing?

292
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,070
They're drinking beer and watching football.

293
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,550
So why don't do that with them.

294
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,100
They don't want me.

295
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,040
What do you mean?

296
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,640
Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

297
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,500
and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about

298
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,620
how sad I was when my dad abandoned...

299
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,820
Zack's here!

300
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,190
Stir the gravy.

301
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,160
Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are.

302
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.

303
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,460
Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.

304
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,380
It's all right. I didn't have anything going on.

305
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,740
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

306
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,380
and Thanksgiving's a time to be with family.

307
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,700
Yeah, okay, great.

308
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,740
Can we just get this over with?

309
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,830
Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here.

310
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,590
On Monday, we'll file for the annulment,

311
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,460
and this "Marriage" will be over.

312
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,840
Okay.

313
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,430
I don't know if I want to sign it.

314
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,740
Why won't you sign it?

315
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,610
I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.

316
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,550
We don't have any kids.

317
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
Are you sure? 'Cause you didn't know

318
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,240
we were married until this morning.

319
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,690
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

320
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,790
You know neither of us thought this was real.

321
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,240
I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.

322
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,950
Of course it was an impersonator.

323
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,290
We could never afford a real Elvis.

324
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,760
You married him instead of me?

325
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Good call.

326
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,170
Sign the papers.

327
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,550
Hang on. You know what?

328
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,360
You have been a jerk about this all day.

329
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,800
You always do this-- whenever I mess up,

330
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.

331
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,550
That is not true.

332
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,500
Yeah, we could've waited till Monday, signed the papers,

333
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,470
this all would have been over.

334
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,590
You're the one who invited him here.

335
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,660
Oh, there you go again--

336
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,840
just another mistake you're throwing in my face.

337
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,730
Not cool, bro.

338
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,910
I'm starting to think

339
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,570
you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.

340
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,030
Yeah, well,

341
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,940
she's not gonna be your wife for long.

342
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,680
Oh, no. Are you dying?

343
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,390
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

344
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,610
Know what they say: "Happy wife,

345
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,750
happy life."

346
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,920
Let's eat.

347
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,040
Two, three, eight, four, six.

348
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,500
That's all I can do without throwing up.

349
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,410
That is not what I expected

350
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,260
when you said you were gonna burp "Pie."

351
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,740
3. 14159 26535 89793 23846

352
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Did somebody say "Pie"?!

353
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,260
I don't know what's scarier:

354
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,680
the bathroom clowns

355
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,670
or the woman that put them there.

356
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,640
All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.

357
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,310
And there's the clown that came out of her.

358
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,530
I really didn't want to come here,

359
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,050
but this is shaping up to be

360
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,890
one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.

361
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,080
Me, too.

362
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,940
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day!

363
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,580
Now, both of you apologize right now!

364
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,600
She's so tiny.

365
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,040
It's funny when she's mad.

366
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,380
All right, mister,

367
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,240
I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.

368
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,260
Perhaps you're right.

369
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,650
I'm sorry for my behavior.

370
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,890
I've had alcohol, and it's caused me to be inappropriate.

371
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,610
- It's okay. - Don't worry about it.

372
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,050
Thank you.

373
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,190
Ain't she great?

374
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,600
Sheldon.

375
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?

376
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,440
Thanks again for cooking.

377
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,800
Yeah, everything was delicious.

378
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,220
Well, I couldn't have done it without my two favorite girls.

379
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,440
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

380
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,810
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside

381
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,150
and throw around the old pigskin?

382
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,430
This is a Jewish house.

383
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,610
I don't think they have pigskin.

384
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,760
Did someone say pigskin!

385
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,540
Hey, honey, I'm sorry about today.

386
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,240
And I promise, next time I get married,

387
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,690
it won't be a joke.

388
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,550
It'll be for love.

389
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,180
Or money.

390
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,740
I'm sorry, too.

391
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,270
Don't be.

392
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,300
It's my fault.

393
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,750
I was a terrible husband.

394
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,290
I was never around.

395
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,780
I know I'm hard on you,

396
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,680
but you're not the worst son-in-law in the world.

397
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,110
Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

398
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,330
Well, I'm drunk.

399
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,780
I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
