1
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,859
Dogs.

2
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,907
Mans best friend.

3
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:26,094
But do we really know
our faithful companions?

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,902
How they see their world?

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,653
What they really think of us?

6
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:36,735
In this film, well meet dogs
that seem to have a sixth sense...

7
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,183
I knew Id got breast cancer
because Max had told me.

8
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,184
undying loyalty...

9
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:43,572
That dog saved my life,

10
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:45,693
and for that, he won the yictoria Cross.

11
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,850
incredible intuition.

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,543
I¡¯ve not taught her to do it,
she¡¯s just done it.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,735
Well follow the life of a growing poppy.

14
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:58,137
It could be any dog,
and in fact, many dogs will play this role.

15
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:04,218
But by watching it develop, we¡¯ll reveal
the hidden abilities in all dogs.

16
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:11,901
In the last few years,

17
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,852
scientists have delved deeper than
ever before into the canine mind and body,

18
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,177
and the results are extraordinary.

19
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,214
The way you see dogs
will never be the same again.

20
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:42,089
A puppy is born every second
somewhere in the world.

21
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:52,626
Md just moments ago,
this litter was joined by a sister,

22
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:57,860
our puppy.

23
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:04,617
She weighs under 500 grammes
and is remarkably vulnerable.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,424
Shes born blind

25
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:12,831
and her ears are sealed closed
for the first two weeks other life

26
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:17,935
as theyre still developing
and theyre too fragile to be exposed.

27
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:24,548
She cant control her own temperature,

28
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,096
so shes totally reliant
on the warmth of her mom.

29
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:34,702
In essence, she¡¯s premature,

30
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,856
so why are puppies born too small

31
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,499
to survive on their own?

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,654
Well, the smeller the puppy,
the larger the litter,

33
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,417
and as long as they have
their mothers protection,

34
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:50,624
more of them will somive.

35
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,903
Combine this with the amazing abilities
hidden inside our puppies,

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,860
and you begin to see why dogs have become
so successful all over the world.

37
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:19,258
Today, dogs are found
in more shapes, sizes and varieties

38
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:21,776
than any other mammal on the planet.

39
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:30,975
There are some 500 million dogs alive today

40
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:34,135
and over 400 recognised breeds.

41
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,290
They¡¯re so familiar to us,
we can forget how extraordinary they are.

42
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:00,571
Even the simple act 0f shaking off water

43
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,898
hides a spectacular technique.

44
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,131
When you slow it down a thousand times,

45
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,540
you can see the head turns
a full 180 degrees.

46
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:26,621
This kick¡ªstarts a rotational momentum
that corkscrews down the body.

47
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:33,723
Expelling water from their fur quickly
so they dont get cold.

48
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:41,421
If youve ever been drenched by a dog
youll know how efficient this technique is.

49
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,568
Their physical abilities may be remarkable,

50
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:55,053
but it¡¯s their relationship with us
that lies at the heart of their success.

51
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,265
Weve trained them so they¡¯ll hunt for us,

52
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:09,696
guard our homes, retrieve on command
and herd our livestock.

53
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,698
But they also bring their own magic
to this partnership.

54
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:25,652
Dogs seem to understand our needs
and have a desire to help us out.

55
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,704
I¡¯ve not taught her to do it,
she¡¯s just done it.

56
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:35,088
Jess, come here. Here.

57
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:39,094
Sit down then. Sit. Sit.

58
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:45,264
Jess is a it¡ªyear¡ªold springer spaniel

59
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:49,466
that helps Louise Moorhouse with
the daily workings 0f her farm in Devon.

60
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,374
Mything you ask her to do, she¡¯ll do it.

61
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,137
Md she just lends her hand to basically,
well, her paw, to anything.

62
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,339
In lambing season,

63
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:02,419
Jess not only carries
the milk bottles for Louise,

64
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,144
but she helps feed the orphaned
lambs herself.

65
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:10,900
She¡¯s over¡ªriding her natural instinct
to chase or even eat the lamb.

66
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,130
She¡¯s just an extra pair of hands, really.

67
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,177
I think she does it
because she¡¯s grown up with the sheep

68
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:18,701
and I think she probably thinks
they¡¯re part 0f her family.

69
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:24,259
It¡¯s this willingness to please
that has led to an enduring partnership.

70
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,731
Some days she¡¯s just like a normal dog,
you know, not listening at all.

71
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:33,418
But other days, to be honest, and most days,
I don¡¯t really treat her as a dog,

72
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:36,015
I think I treat her as my best
friend, really.

73
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,975
Md the first stages of this relationship
are formed

74
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,338
when dogs are at their most loveable.

75
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:58,296
Back with our puppy and shes only just
beginning to be aware of her surroundings.

76
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,978
Her eyes and ears that were closed
for the first two weeks of her life

77
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:14,575
are now opening.

78
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:22,825
Md with this comes a whole new world
of sensory stimulation.

79
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,016
She uses her vision to move around,

80
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,978
but does she see the world
the same way we do?

81
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:48,133
Well, dogs are colour blind,

82
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,851
but that doesn¡¯t mean
that everything is black and white.

83
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:57,650
She does see colour,
but mostly just blues end yellows.

84
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,934
Its becsuse she only has
two types of colour receptors

85
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,725
compared to humans who have three.

86
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:10,489
Md it¡¯s also why your dog will often ignore
an orange toy in the green grass

87
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,696
as those colours look the same too.

88
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,929
Better to give them something blue.

89
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:27,015
But it¡¯s when things are moving,
that her vision comes into its own.

90
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:35,491
Dog¡¯s eyes process
what they see more quickly than we do.

91
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,899
It¡¯s almost like they see in slow motion.

92
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,773
That¡¯s why they¡¯re always in the right place
to catch the frisbee.

93
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:08,571
A dogs hearing is siso superhuman.

94
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:14,135
They can hesr things four times further away
and twice as high pitched as we can.

95
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,292
Its why we can¡¯t hear dog whistles,

96
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,417
but it also means
they can hear the hum of lights,

97
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:25,617
and even the pulsing sound
of a quart crystal in a digital clock.

98
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,577
But there¡¯s one sense she¡¯ll use
more than any other,

99
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,827
her sense of smell.

100
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,622
A dogs brain is one¡ªtenth the size of ours,

101
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:47,905
but the part that controls smell
is 40 times larger.

102
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:55,371
They have up to 300 million scent glands
in their nose compared to our 5 million.

103
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:59,730
So don¡¯t kid yourself,
you can¡¯t hide a bone from your dog

104
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,343
just because it¡¯s out of sight.

105
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:12,774
Our puppy is your weeks old
and shes busy exploring her home.

106
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,979
But not like we would.

107
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,059
We look around with our eyes.

108
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:22,297
She looks around with her nose.

109
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:30,375
Its why a healthy dog
likes to keep its nose wet.

110
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,500
This maximises the number of scent molecules
it can absorb from the air.

111
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,780
Their nose is their superpower.

112
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:44,983
Its so powerful
they can smell well into the distant past.

113
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,543
When we watch a dog
enter a new environment,

114
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:52,897
it looks like they just walk in
the same way we would.

115
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,298
But when you see the world
from their perspective,

116
00:10:57,414 --> 00:11:02,215
you realise theyre picking up all the
information they need with their noses.

117
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,005
Not only can they smell objects
that were there

118
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,258
and have now been cleaned away.

119
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,906
Their senses are so keen,

120
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:20,898
they can smell events days, weeks,
even months after they¡¯ve happened.

121
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:32,261
So theyll know if there might just be a bit
of food left behind that they could eat.

122
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:38,012
This all comes naturally to a dog.

123
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,180
But when you train this wet,
snuffly, food¡ªfinding ability,

124
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,536
the results can save lives.

125
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,133
Good boy, go on.

126
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,057
The dogs are very, very efficient.

127
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:58,417
They¡¯re probably equal
to about 10 people searching.

128
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:01,216
Max is a wilderness air¡ªscenting dog

129
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,619
and he¡¯s trained to pickup human scent

130
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:07,492
so he can find missing people
for his handler, yjes Lyons.

131
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,934
We all smell, whether we like it or not,

132
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:14,575
and our scent gets carried in the wind
and that¡¯s what he¡¯s trained to locate.

133
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:19,416
He gets that excited he cant bark properly,
so he gives me a huff¡ªhuff thing.

134
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:25,822
Max is one of the most successful
search and rescue dogs in the country.

135
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,727
He knows what he¡¯s doing, don¡¯t you?

136
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,217
Dogs like Mao can really make a difference
when all reasonable hope has been lost.

137
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:47,819
I had been to Exeter to do shopping
and I came home on the bus

138
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:52,700
and I rang the bell to stop at the green
and it didnt.

139
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:57,461
Md it took me on,
further up here to Qoickes farm.

140
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,726
Mdl said to the driver,
¡®Oh, it¡¯s all right,

141
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,180
I can get off here,
go through the arboretum

142
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:05,053
and Fm at my back gate.

143
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:10,367
But I got in the arboretum,
I couldnt find my way out.

144
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:16,260
Seventy¡ªnine¡ªyear¡ªold Margaret Haverson

145
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:21,053
hadnt considered that the woodland
had been neglected for over 4t years

146
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,774
and was completely overgrown.

147
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:30,290
I get tied up with the brambles and that.

148
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,614
This was all covered in brambles.

149
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,052
Md then it got cold and dark and that¡ª¡ª
sol lay down under a big tree,

150
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,779
which could have been that one?

151
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,415
But it was a big tree.

152
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:50,178
Margaret lay under that tree for three days
and two frozen nights

153
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,543
while the police force, volunteers and
even helicopters with heat¡ªseeking cameras

154
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,012
combed the area trying to locate her.

155
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,857
Yes, and I was frozen.

156
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,734
So Max was called in

157
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:09,572
to see if a dogs nose could succeed
where everything else had failed

158
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,458
and before it was too late.

159
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:18,374
To tell you the truth,
I was not expecting to find Margaret alive.

160
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,368
I thought, because 0f the weather,

161
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,849
I thought she would have died
0f hypothermia.

162
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,497
But then I kept dozing off and on,

163
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:35,177
until you came and found me,
or you came and found me.

164
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:36,983
Yeah, Max found you, didn¡¯t he? Yeah.

165
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,623
¡ª You were a good boy, you were.
¡ªYeah.

166
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,777
Where humans had failed,

167
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:47,332
Maxs nose cut though the undergrowth
and saved Margarets life.

168
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:55,176
I was very cold and very relieved,
when I was licked all over by a dog.

169
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,779
He was so happy, weren¡¯t you?

170
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:01,215
Yes.

171
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,372
O course, you¡¯re good, aren¡¯t you?

172
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,131
¡ª Yeah, good boy.
¡ª You¡¯re good.

173
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,527
Our litter 0f pups are now five weeks old
and theyre becoming more adventurous.

174
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:32,098
Testing what they can destroy
with their teeth.

175
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,019
Md who they can and cant pick fights with.

176
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,684
But above all, theyre discovering
what it means to be a dog.

177
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:54,421
Simple play between two puppies
reveals the wild ancestor within.

178
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,688
Their hunting instinct,

179
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,020
the dominant and submissive behaviours
that are essential to pack life.

180
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:17,215
This is because all dots
can trace their ancestry back to the wolf.

181
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,210
So, if all dogs came from one species,

182
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,290
then how did they end op
to be so many different shapes and sioes?

183
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,132
When we first domesticated dogs,
we bred out some of the wild behaviours.

184
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:44,291
Md this process accidentally led
to new characteristics:

185
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,534
coloured coats, curly tails and floppy ears.

186
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,965
Add a few thousand years of breeding
from the dogs we love the most,

187
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,534
and you have the huge variety
that we see today.

188
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:03,814
In theory,
any dog can mate with any other dog.

189
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:07,097
But practicalities get in the way.

190
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,332
If humans were as different
as a pug and a Saint Bernard,

191
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:18,333
then our heights would range
from 65 centimetres to it metres tall.

192
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,422
But there¡¯s one thing
that just about every dog does,

193
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,170
bark.

194
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,654
So why do they bark?

195
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,137
Where does it come from?

196
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,966
Wolves don¡¯t bark, they howl.

197
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:45,499
Some scientists think that barking
has evolved just for our benefit.

198
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,063
So does this mean
that theyre talking to os?

199
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,019
Md if so, what are they saying?

200
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,422
They seem to understand our words...

201
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,300
Dig, dig.

202
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,089
Come on, speak.

203
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,417
Good boy.

204
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:05,450
But can dots really talk to us by barking?

205
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,686
I dont think anybody ever understands dog.

206
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,652
They understand you.
I dont think you ever understand a dog.

207
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:15,731
Lets see if these owners can understand
what different barks mean?

208
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:21,684
Put them on the doff, shell probably
be able to tell the difference than me.

209
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,091
Okay.

210
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,580
Cant hear a thing.

211
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:30,779
Its unhappy.

212
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:34,298
It wants attention, its frustrated.

213
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:39,011
I visual ise him in an open space on a lead

214
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:43,861
and he wants to be off
and to go to somewhere or somebody.

215
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:56,423
It sounds quite a happy bark,
it sounds as if it¡¯s playing.

216
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,056
To me, that sounds like you are just about
tothrowa baliforthedog

217
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,928
and theres that level of excitement.

218
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,530
Its running all around you.

219
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,217
Its been identified
that dots can communicate

220
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,680
at least six different emotions to us
through their barks.

221
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:14,496
That¡¯s why I know what you¡¯re thinking.

222
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:20,814
Well, that just proves, doesn¡¯t it,
that dots can talk by barking.

223
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,688
Back with our growing puppy,

224
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:28,500
she¡¯s not trying to communicate with us
just yet.

225
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:33,614
Only foe weeks old,
the puppies sre still finding their feet

226
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,731
and slowly gaining independence
from their mother.

227
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:44,064
Milk is replaced
with a first tentative interest in water.

228
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:51,811
The tip of a dogs tongue
has taste buds just for water.

229
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,369
They create a desire to drink

230
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,455
which is important as their natural diet
of meat is high in salt.

231
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:09,733
But even the simple act of drinking
is more complicated than it looks.

232
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,425
Dogs come their tongue into the water

233
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:24,293
to create a large surface area
to stick the water to.

234
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,325
They pull it up into their mouth,

235
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:35,452
snapping it shut
before all the water escapes.

236
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,494
Its a surprisingly complex
and beautiful process

237
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:45,293
for such a simple daily requirement.

238
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,965
Md it¡¯s also why dogs make such a mess
when they¡¯re drinking.

239
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:03,323
Puppies sleep far more than they are awake,
just like human babies.

240
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:10,732
Exhausted from a world of new experiences,
they fall into a deep slumber.

241
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:18,418
It looks like they are dreaming
about chasing rabbits,

242
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:22,376
but is that just our human sentiments
getting in the way?

243
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,419
Dogs do dream.

244
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:29,212
Md by monitoring their brain waves,

245
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,653
scientists have found out that puppies
dream far more than adult doss.

246
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,418
They can even tell that dots dream
about the days events,

247
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:40,137
processing their memories.

248
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,685
Looks like its been quite a busy day.

249
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,087
But what will the future huld?

250
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:58,062
A furtnight later and uur puppys arrived

251
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,887
at one of the world¡¯s most high¡ªtech,
specialist dog centres.

252
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,929
Shes here to find out
if she has what it takes,

253
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:13,649
to make it as one of the most
sought¡ªafter dogs in the country.

254
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:23,449
Is she fit, healthy, intelligent
and above all, the right character

255
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:26,009
to be a guide dog for the blind?

256
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:38,498
The first test is to see how she¡¯ll respond
to an unfamiliar, slightly scary sound.

257
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:45,133
She should react, but not panic.

258
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:51,570
¡ª Very good.
¡ª Really nice.

259
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,579
She set and watched that very intently.

260
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,938
Ready?

261
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,327
The most crucial trait is loyalty,

262
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:00,941
looking to her owner at all times
and in all situations.

263
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:05,097
Puppy, puppy, come on.

264
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,297
There we are. That¡¯s very good.

265
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:09,451
Md it seems like she¡¯s got what it takes.

266
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,449
¡ª A star in the making.
-Yes.

267
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,775
You might wonder if your dog could qualify
to be a guide dog

268
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:20,373
You can get an idea by observing them.

269
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:24,655
Research has shown
that dots are left or right¡ªpawed.

270
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:28,967
You a left¡ªfooter, Max, eh?
ke you a left footer, no?

271
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:33,250
You can test this by wstching closely
to see which paw they step off with.

272
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,096
I think that was the right foot
that started.

273
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,455
Here, yeah, she¡¯s left¡ªfooted, isn¡¯t she?

274
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:39,856
You¡¯re left¡ªhanded.

275
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,009
Okay, lets go.

276
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:46,057
I think weve proven there
in that unbiased test

277
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:48,326
that it was his right foot
that came forward.

278
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:52,497
Preliminary research has shown
that right¡ªpawed dogs

279
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,685
are statistically more likely
to pass their guide dot test.

280
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,532
You¡¯d get them run over by a bus you would,
wouldn¡¯t you?

281
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:03,860
There¡¯s another clue
to the chances of them passing,

282
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:09,093
in the swirls of hair on your dog,
and it all depends which way they turn.

283
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:10,853
CIodise.

284
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:13,774
MticIocise.

285
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,319
If your dog is right¡ªpawed
and the swirl goes anticlockwise,

286
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:22,448
then your dog is more likely to be calm,
confident and self¡ªassured.

287
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:25,882
Exactly the traits that a guide dog needs.

288
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:29,378
Do you want to be a guide dog?

289
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:31,938
You could be a blind dog for the guides.

290
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,448
Md if your dog is left¡ªpawed,

291
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,323
be prepared for some creative solutions
to your problems.

292
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:48,220
Back with our puppy, and she¡¯s joined
a group of other potential guide dogs.

293
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:53,136
Md what do you know,
shes also right¡ªpawed.

294
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:58,495
There¡¯s still a year of training
to complete,

295
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:00,684
but for now, she can have fun.

296
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:13,091
We¡¯ve trained doss for thousands of years
to work with us,

297
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,732
harnessing their incredible
physical abilities.

298
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,767
Md the husky is one of the best there is.

299
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,566
They¡¯re superb athletes,

300
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:43,459
able to run for over 15t kilometres a day
in subzero temperatures,

301
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:47,133
and they love it.

302
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,561
They have a coat of fur two layers thick
that insulates them from the cold.

303
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,533
Even at minus 60, they won¡¯t get frostbite.

304
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,454
Md when they need to cool down,
like all dogs, they pent.

305
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,810
By looking at these huskies
with a thermal camera,

306
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,093
we can see that their mouths and tongues
are white

307
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,816
with the heat that they are expelling
from their body core.

308
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,406
Md it means that when your dog
is panting after a run,

309
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,257
shea not puffed out,
shes just cooling down.

310
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,638
Its a dogs main method of losing heat,

311
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,379
as theyre covered in fur,

312
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:44,251
the only place they can really sweat
is through their paws.

313
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:54,929
Dogs have been our working companions
for as long as we can remember.

314
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:01,134
We¡¯ve used the basset hound¡¯s nose
to sniff out prey,

315
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,286
the Rottweiler¡¯s strength
for guarding our homes,

316
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,664
the Afghan¡¯s sight and speed to give chase,

317
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:20,374
and the huskys endurance
in extreme environments.

318
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:24,663
But from the very beginning,

319
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:28,896
we¡¯ve also chosen dogs that are cute
and give us comfort.

320
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,613
Md no matter what the size,
dogs have worked their way into our hearts.

321
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,331
Its a strong emotional bond,

322
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,529
and one that our rapidly growing puppy
is just beginning to discooer.

323
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:53,850
Now nine weeks old, she¡¯s taking
her first steps into her new home

324
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,409
and a very special new relationship.

325
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:03,124
This is the family who will raise her
until shes ready to be a guide dog.

326
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,613
Its here that shell learn
to live with people.

327
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,020
Md it¡¯s the perfect time
for this transition.

328
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,846
At this key stage in their life,

329
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:20,278
puppies actually prefer to go
to human companions than other dogs.

330
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:28,249
When a puppy holds our gaze
with its big eyes and infant¡ªlike features,

331
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,048
it causes our brain to react as though
were looking at a human baby.

332
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,810
But have you ever wondered
what theyre thinking?

333
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:43,812
Sometimes dogs look at us
with such knowing eyes.

334
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,660
But do they really know how we feel?

335
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,250
They can read what sort of mood you¡¯re in.

336
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:55,167
They¡¯re somebody who can understand
how you¡¯re feeling ins day,

337
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:56,611
whether you are feeling upset.

338
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,489
They know when Fm hurting,
they know when I¡¯m sad.

339
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:05,737
Md, yeah, 100 percent
I think they understand me.

340
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:11,810
Dogs definitely look at us
like they know what¡¯s up.

341
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,404
Md tests have shown
that theres truth in this.

342
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:22,930
Humans naturally look to the left hand side
of someone¡¯s face to read their mood

343
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,811
as that¡¯s where we display our emotions.

344
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:29,737
Dogs are one of the few other species
that haoe picked upon this

345
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,662
and they also do it
to tell how we are feeling.

346
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,412
Who can resist a dog
when its trying to cheer yoo up?

347
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:44,405
For some people, this irresistible affection
has transformed their lives.

348
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:51,405
Na officer Allen Parton suffered
a severe head injury

349
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,765
while on active duty in the Gulf War.

350
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:58,098
It left him confi ned to a wheelchair,
unable to talk

351
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:00,918
and he lost half of his life¡¯s memories.

352
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,021
You know, I cant remember
my children¡¯s first steps,

353
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,012
their first days at school,
their being born,

354
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,022
and I was there for all of those occasions.

355
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:09,889
But, sadly, those are memories robbed to me.

356
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:16,174
But more than this,
ilen didn¡¯t even recognise his children.

357
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:20,769
He had no idea who the lady was
that he had apparently married.

358
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,925
Md hed lost the ability
to feel any emotion.

359
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,848
I had two attempts at suicide
in rehabilitation

360
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,376
because I¡¯d lost my past, I¡¯d lost my future

361
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,894
and I was really in a psychologically
bad place, as well as physically.

362
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:44,971
But that all changed with a chance encnunter
with a dog named Endal,

363
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,741
who was failing his training
to be an assistance dog,

364
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:49,538
and needed a home.

365
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:51,970
At the time, there was
this one¡ªyear¡ªold Labrador up there

366
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,539
that had health problems
and a huge attitude problem

367
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:58,570
and bless him, you know, he saw something
on the floor by my wheelchair,

368
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:01,566
trotted across the training centre,
picked it up and put it in my lap.

369
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,655
Well, he didn¡¯t get a reaction,
he didn¡¯t get a treat,

370
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,927
he didn¡¯t get acknowledged.

371
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,251
Md this really hacked him off.

372
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,179
I mean, this was a dog
that didn¡¯t do anything for anyone

373
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:09,454
and he¡¯d done it for me,

374
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,812
and he wanted a treat,
a reward, praise, anything,

375
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:12,968
and he got the stone wall,

376
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,457
and then he trotted over
to the mock¡ªup supermarket

377
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,131
and took a tin 0ff the shelf,
brought it back and put it in my lap,

378
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,330
didn¡¯t get a reaction.

379
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:22,694
To cut a long story short,
I was disappearing under a mound of stuff.

380
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,453
Md just before I completely disappeared,
the brain switched on

381
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,564
and I smiled for the first time
in a long time.

382
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:32,333
Md it was the start of our relationship.

383
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:35,697
Endal became his 24¡ªhour companion,

384
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,689
aiding with every practical aspect
of his lit e.

385
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:41,684
He even helped Allen
reconnect with his family.

386
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,288
Md in 2002, AlIen remarried his wife

387
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,382
with Endal as his best man.

388
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:54,490
But this dog had to show his true devotion
when in the dead of night,

389
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,561
iIen and Endal were both hit bye car.

390
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,250
But though I was knocked unconscious
out of the wheelchair

391
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,282
and Endal had been stunned
by the vehicle as well,

392
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:05,772
he got up,
pulled me into the recovery position,

393
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:07,811
he retrieved his blanket
from under my wheel chair,

394
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:08,888
and covered me with it.

395
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,561
Md in the dark, he found my mobile phone
which had jettisoned off in the impact

396
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:14,017
and he brought it to my face.

397
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:16,810
Md then he made the brave decision
to limp off and go to a nearby hotel

398
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,181
and raise the alarm.

399
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:22,052
Md for that, he won the Victoria Cross
for animal bravery.

400
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:27,535
That dog had saved my life, my marriage

401
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,563
and brought me back to my children.

402
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:33,818
No one coold have predicted
the life¡ªchanging impact

403
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:36,380
that Endal would have on Allen¡¯s family.

404
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:41,054
It was a remarkable bond
and an incredible life,

405
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:44,020
but, inevitably, ate caught up with Endal.

406
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:50,536
I¡¯d had a lovely evening with Endal at home
knowing the vet was coming the next day.

407
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:54,099
I was able to tell him how much I loved him,
you know, what he¡¯d done for me.

408
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:57,534
Yeah, it was,
it was quite an emotional evening.

409
00:32:57,732 --> 00:33:01,179
Md the final gift he gave me
was that gift of sadness.

410
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,849
I didn¡¯t know that emotion,

411
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:07,379
but that day Endal, you know, left me,
you know, put to sleep in my lap,

412
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,047
was the day that my heart broke
and I cried, yeah.

413
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,738
But there was a little guy in the corner

414
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:16,924
who was there with a han in his mouth
to wipe away the tears.

415
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,282
Hed been nurturing
alongside Endal for a year,

416
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:24,177
and that day,
he picked up the baton and ran with it.

417
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:28,249
Good lad.

418
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:32,730
Good boy.

419
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,289
Some people come up to me in the street

420
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:37,842
and they saythey wish they had a dog
as clever as Endal or EJ is,

421
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,048
and, and I think they have,

422
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,287
they just haven¡¯t opened
their minds and hearts.

423
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:56,092
Our faithful friend is now three months old.

424
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:59,844
Md her guide dog training
is starting in earnest.

425
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:02,288
Shes learning simple commands,

426
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,659
like returning to her owners call.

427
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,765
Md sitting on request.

428
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,689
Good girl.

429
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,126
PJI basic skills,

430
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,170
but really rather important
if you¡¯re gonna be a guide dog.

431
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:21,811
Shes also showing signs that her bond
with the family ingrowing.

432
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:28,290
A lick of the face or a kiss on the lips
definitely feels like true affection.

433
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,303
Md this is proof that your dog
is treating you like her mother.

434
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:38,900
Ps this behaviour originally comes
from a puppy licking her mums lips

435
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,658
to get her to regurgitate her dinner.

436
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:44,408
Nice.

437
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,926
We¡¯ve been watching a puppy grow,

438
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,667
and now that she¡¯s nine months old,
she¡¯s just about full size.

439
00:34:58,658 --> 00:35:00,535
But like a lanky teenager,

440
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:03,614
shea not totally in control of it all
Jo St yet

441
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:10,696
Shes also taking the next steps
in her guide dog training.

442
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:15,695
Learning about strange sights,
sounds and smells.

443
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:20,098
Md most importantly,
bonding with her family.

444
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,786
Mother sure sign 0f this attachment
is a yawn.

445
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:38,349
It turns nut that the infectious nature
of yawns is a sign of empathy.

446
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:43,731
Suit ynu yawn and your dog yawns back,

447
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,140
it means ynuve got a good bond.

448
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:57,382
Have you ever wondered
why its so relaxing to hang out with a dog?

449
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:04,708
This is the Evelina Childrens Hospital
in London.

450
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:10,268
Md Magee is s normal dog,
with a very special job to do.

451
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,067
Hey, George, it¡¯s Magee.

452
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,936
George was admitted to hospital
on Christmas Eve just over a year ago.

453
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,425
Do you wanna stroke him?

454
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:30,172
He had a ruptured diaphragm,
and needed drastic surgery.

455
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:34,984
For the next 18 hours,
his parents didn¡¯t know if he would survive.

456
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,654
He¡¯s doing well now,
but he hasn¡¯t been home in all this time.

457
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:42,706
Give him a biscuit.

458
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,656
Oh, boy, he liked that. Oh, yeah.

459
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:53,298
So the one thing George looks forvard to
is this weekly visit from McGee.

460
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:54,658
That¡¯s nice.

461
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:58,071
But he gets a lot more out of it
than just a cuddle.

462
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,991
Oh, he gioes looely kisses.

463
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:05,893
When we stroke a dog,
it makes us feel happy and relaxed.

464
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:11,180
Tests have shown
that it lowers our blood pressure.

465
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:16,180
This is because our bodies release oxtocin
into our bloodstream,

466
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:21,502
the same hormone produced
when mothers breastfeed their babies.

467
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:26,900
This means we¡¯ll feel the peaceful,
warm sense of bonding and attachment

468
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:29,427
that a mother would with her newborn child.

469
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:36,863
Statistically, people live longer
if they own dogs.

470
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,458
That¡¯s lovely, isn¡¯t it, Magee?

471
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:43,626
They are less likely to have a heart attack,
and more likely to sumive one.

472
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,499
Oh, oh, that didn¡¯t take long, did it?

473
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:51,713
¡ª Oh, he¡¯s kissing you.
¡ª Oh, he¡¯s very lovely.

474
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,895
Yeah.

475
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:57,273
But the benefits go both ways.

476
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,588
Cuddle a dog,
and her blood pressure will also drop.

477
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:07,895
She even produces
the attachment hormone otocin.

478
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:13,229
So shes feeling that same bond
that goes between a mother and her child.

479
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,984
But how far does this special connection go?

480
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:23,533
Some people think their dogs
have almost supernatural powers.

481
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:29,736
Is there any truth that they can sense
when youre about to take them for a walk?

482
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:33,303
Or predict when youre going to faint?

483
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:38,378
Do some dogs really know us better
than we know ourselves?

484
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,627
The puppy we¡¯ve been following
is just over a year old.

485
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,626
Shes now living at the guide dot centre,

486
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:54,376
going through the toughest phase
of her training yet.

487
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,589
Shes made the important bond with humans,

488
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:08,018
but now, she must put it to practical use,
and do something really impressive.

489
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,946
Looking after a blind vulnerable
handler means

490
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:16,222
knowing to stop at the edge of the road.

491
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:20,584
Shes anticipating her handlers needs,

492
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,784
avoiding obstacles on the ground,
but also in the air.

493
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:30,070
She could walk right through this arch,

494
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:33,379
but she knows thst her blind handler
would hit her heed.

495
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,377
Good girl.

496
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,894
So how is she doing this?

497
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,664
It comes down to obsemat ion.

498
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:49,633
Dogs watch us all the time
in a way that no other animal does.

499
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:55,940
He senses whenever we are going to go out
and he knows before we even make a move.

500
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,277
They read nor body language,

501
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:02,219
and that¡¯s how they know
were going to take them for a walk,

502
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:05,274
before we think
weoe made the decision ourseloes.

503
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:09,631
Its this constant observation

504
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:12,788
that can sometimes appear
to give them a sixth sense.

505
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:21,989
Max isa red collie cross
normally full 0f energy and enthusiasm,

506
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:25,432
but in 2008, his owner Maureen Burns

507
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,535
noticed that something was wrong.

508
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:33,178
I thought at the time Mas was fading,
he was nine and a half,

509
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:38,660
and I was preparing myself for losing him,
because of... he just wasn¡¯t happy.

510
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:43,143
He wouldn¡¯t come with me,
wouldn¡¯t sit by me, wouldn¡¯t sit on my lap,

511
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:47,457
and the odd signs, he would come up

512
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:52,225
and touch my breast with his nose
and back off

513
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:56,303
so desperately unhappy,
with such a sad look in his eyes.

514
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:59,635
Maureen had a small lump in her breast

515
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:01,784
but her latest mammogram was clear

516
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,099
so she presumed all was okay.

517
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:11,348
Initially, I thought, ¡°Oh, it¡¯s just another
lumpy breast as people get.¡±

518
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,381
But then

519
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:21,431
I sort of connected it with the dog,
with his odd behaviour.

520
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:25,070
Md one day, I was looking in the mirror
in the bedroom here,

521
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:28,588
and I looked across in the mirror
at Max¡¯s eyes,

522
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,784
he was on the bed, as he is now,

523
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:33,791
and I knew it was cancer.

524
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:38,298
Maureen went to her local hospital

525
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:41,630
but both a scan and a mammogram
came back negative.

526
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,790
It took a surgical biopsy
to finally detect the cancer.

527
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:51,106
Maureen had it removed,

528
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,383
and the change in Mans behaviour
was instant.

529
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:58,227
The day I was picked up from the hospital,

530
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:02,063
he was his old hyper self again.

531
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:08,584
He put his nose across my breast
to check where the operation had been

532
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:11,268
and he was wagging his tail
and his eyes were happy

533
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:15,383
and it was unbelievable, the change
in him, instant.

534
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:21,538
I love Max xv much and lowe him so much.

535
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:26,817
Md even before Ego for a check¡ªup now,
I get him to check me out

536
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:34,347
and if he¡¯s happy and wagging his tail,
I¡¯m happy and I know I¡¯m okay.

537
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:39,152
We now know that dogs like Max

538
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:43,588
are smelling the tiny volatile chemicals
given off by cancerous tumours.

539
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,823
Most dogs can do this.
They just don¡¯t know that we¡¯re interested.

540
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:53,900
But with a little training,

541
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:58,822
dogs can accurately pick out a cancerous
patient from a selection of urine samples.

542
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:00,268
Good girl.

543
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:02,706
Good girl.

544
00:43:04,142 --> 00:43:07,430
They can even be taught
to let diabetics like Steven know

545
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,173
that his blood sugar levels
are smelling low,

546
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:14,710
long before he can feel it,
and definitely before he passes oot.

547
00:43:16,782 --> 00:43:21,173
Dogs like Stevens are now transforming
lives all over the coontry.

548
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:23,858
They are being trained
to detect the early warning signals

549
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:28,863
for severe allergic reactions,
epileptic fits and narcolepsy.

550
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,018
Our dog has also done something remarkable.

551
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:42,464
Shea done more
than just qualify to be a guide dog,

552
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:49,821
shes done so well in all her tests,

553
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:54,740
that Guide Dogs for the Blind would like her
to be a mother to the next generation.

554
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:02,180
Now aged it months old, our puppy,

555
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,813
who we followed from birth

556
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:05,939
is going to have a litter of her own.

557
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:13,707
Just like a human, she may esperience
morning sickness and strange food cravings,

558
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:19,531
but 63 days after conception,
she¡¯ll give birth

559
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:22,355
and the cycle will begin all over again.

560
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:28,026
A new litter of dogs,
with all their potential,

561
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:29,540
entering the world.

562
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:38,375
I¡¯m really surprised
how much she means to me, really,

563
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,706
weve always had them as a pet,
but shes definitely more than that.

564
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:49,148
I think every time you go out,
you learn something about the dogs,

565
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:51,103
you always learn something new.

566
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:57,453
There¡¯s so many benefits of having a dog
in one¡¯s life.

567
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,018
I cant recommend it highly enough.

568
00:45:02,984 --> 00:45:05,464
Dogs give us an incredible amount.

569
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:09,103
il, all we can ever do
is look after them and love them.

570
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:10,992
Together, were steam.

571
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,581
Dogs are super intelligent
and have amazing powers.

572
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,713
God, I love him.

573
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:25,533
We now understand dogs
better than ever before.

574
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:29,581
Md the more we know aboot oor dogs,
the more we love them.

575
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:33,101
So dogs, slobbery, hairy mutts

576
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:34,710
only interested in food?

577
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:39,274
Sometimes, but mostly, just brilliant.
