片名：三星大厨
THE CHEF

4
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,961
奶油香煎比目鱼，2号桌！
<i>Sole meunière, table 2!</i>

5
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,170
11号桌的炖小牛肉
<i>Blanquette for 11.</i>

6
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,027
鞑靼牛排
<i>Steak tartare.</i>

7
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,679
法式牛排，夏多布里昂牛排和薯条
<i>Entrecôte, château Briand,
and fries.</i>

8
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:28,318
别管装饰了，那家伙只有20分钟时间吃饭
Forget the decorations.
The guy has 20 minutes to eat.

9
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,498
- 还没好
- 8号桌的勒庞尚干红
- That's not enough.
- Faugères for table 8.

10
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,658
- 他们是不是吃的小牛肉？
- 对
- Aren't they having veal?
- Yes.

11
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,452
- 你们点了勒庞尚干红？
- 对
You ordered Faugères?
- Yes.

12
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,866
- 我可以问下为什么吗？
- 服务生推荐的
- Can I ask why?
- The waiter suggested it.

13
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,083
糟糕的建议
Damned boozehound.

14
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,720
吃炖小牛肉的话，试试用干白配餐
With a veal blanquette,
try a dry white.

15
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,776
- 比如2003年的麝香干白葡萄酒
- 我们比较喜欢红酒
- For example, a 2003 Muscadet.
- We prefer red.

16
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,633
你们喜欢红酒？没问题
You prefer red?
No problem.

17
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:03,376
那样子的话，牛排和薯条更适合
In that case, steak and
fries would be a safer bet.

18
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,801
我的炖牛肉！
My blanquette!

19
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,362
不能再给我次机会吗？
Can't I have one more chance?

20
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,571
- 才一周啊
- 不行
Just a week.
- No.

21
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,277
你没意识到吗？你搅了6个人的餐点！
Don't you realize? You
attacked 6 people over meat!

22
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,426
- 他们要7分熟的羊肉！
- 那有怎么样？
- They wanted their lamb medium!
- So what?

23
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,389
你差点就打了那个在比目鱼上加芥末的家伙
You almost hit a guy
who put mustard on his sole.

24
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,168
博古斯说了什么？
What does Bocuse say?

25
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,046
别再提博古斯的那些废话了
Bocuse can blow it
out his ass.

26
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,039
我们不是正式餐厅
We don't do fine dining.

27
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,265
4岁第一次做了巴斯克鸡片，5岁第一次做了舒芙蕾
First Basque chiken at 4,
first soufflé at 5.

28
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,193
他们说我是那个区域的莫扎特
They say I'm
the Mozart of the range.

29
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:39,125
哪里的莫扎特？
Mozart of the what?

30
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,365
厨房里的…
The kitchen range...

31
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,666
我知道所有大厨的食谱
I know all the big
chefs' recipes.

32
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,876
我是个烹饪能手
I'm a culinary whiz.

33
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,301
先生们，大家好

00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,691
严肃点，先生们
Let's get serious. Men, please.

38
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:04,697
今天我推荐给大家的是白核桃慕斯
Today I suggest
a butternut squash mousse

39
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:09,929
和栗子骨牌以及配在栎叶生菜上的番茄意大利水饺
with chestnut dominoes and
tomato ravioli on oak leaf lettuce.

40
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,651
配薯条吗？
Come with fries?

41
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,689
配撒有辣椒粉的甜菜根
It comes with beets
à la paprika,

42
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,792
加胡萝卜沫的西洋菜汤

with carrot foam

43
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,916
以及少量阿金库尔醋
and a dash of
Azincourt vinegar.

44
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,423
这白痴是谁？
Who's this faggot?

45
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,731
带着你那些辣椒废话滚开！
Beat it, you and
your paprika crap!

46
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:46,216
杰克，终于要买你的大厨装了？
So Jacky?
Finally buying your chef's outfit?

47
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:49,373
很快，很快，你会见到的
Soon.
Soon, you'll see.

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,606
在牛肉上撒些面包屑
Sprinkle the beef
with breadcrumbs

49
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,523
和融化的黄油

50
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,325
丁香，碎橙皮
Cloves.

51
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,400
工作做的如何了？
How did work go?

52
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:04,747
不是吧，杰克！一个月里被炒了4次？
No, Jacky!
Fired 4 times in 4 weeks!

53
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,839
很快我们就是三个人了！
Soon there will be
three of us!

54
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,577
他们根本不理解我
They don't understand me, at all.

55
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:14,082
- 看到我们的透支额没？
- 是的，我知道
- See our overdraft?
- Yeah, I know.

56
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,502
- 怎么了？
- 没事…
- What is it?
- I'm fine...

57
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,680
你还好吗，亲爱的？
You okay, baby?

58
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,703
你确定？
Are you sure?

59
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:25,475
你应该要休产假了
You have to stop working.

60
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,535
我会想办法找个工作的
And I'll find a way
to get a job.

61
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,386
- 任何工作，这样你就可以休息了
- 任何工作？
- Any job. So you can relax.
- Any job?

62
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,700
我找到的第一个

63
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,034
而且保证不被炒
And I won't get fired.

64
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:47,506
主厨好…
Hello, chef...

65
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,665
很高兴能见到大家
It's nice to leave

68
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,946
喜欢我的洋葱鸭腿吗？
Do you like my
onions confit?

69

- 相当好吃

我该怎么支持？
How do I eat?

73
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,009
用餐叉叉着吃…
You stab it with a fork...

74
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,288
主厨！
Chef!

75
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,395
- 不好意思
- 没事
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

76
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,976
你有义务给马特先生看菜单
You're legally bound
to show Mr. Matter the menu.

77
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:38,878
我现在没时间
I have no time.

78
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,377
他也会解释其他的餐厅
He'll explain
about the other restaurants.

79
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,459
晚点再说，马丽恩

80
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,319
这样不行
It's no good.

81
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,528
我吃不出情感
I feel no emotion.

82
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,893
- 给我香草
- 给

- Nonsense.

86
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,631
不能做为春季菜单
Not for the Spring menu.

87
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,176
我已经想尽一切了
I'm getting nowhere.

88
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,971
马特先生送来了一份菜单
Mr. Matter sent over a menu.

89
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,241
他想让你用这份
He wants you to use it.

90
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,300
他快要惹恼我了，跟我来
He's starting to piss me off.
Follow me.

91
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,949
- 别一脸忧郁了
- 我没有
- Stop moping.
- I'm not.

92
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,079
你说过你会做任何事
You said you'd do anything.

93
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,244
我是说过，而且我正在做
I said it and I'm doing it.

94
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,101
- 不就6个月嘛
- 一下子就过去了
- It's just for 6 months.
- It'll whiz by.

95
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,461
祝一天愉快
Have a good day.

96
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:02,140
- 我想我会喜欢上这的
- 加油
- I think I'll like it here.
- Go on.

97
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:05,141
所有的窗都需要重刷
All the windows need
to be repainted.

98
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,340
总共524扇

99
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,414
然后…
Next...

100
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,077
188扇门…
the doors... 188.

101
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:13,988
很好
Great.

102
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,782
- 他们在吃什么？
- 不知道，管他呢
- What are they eating?
- No idea. Who cares?

103
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,759
你的工作服
Your overalls.

104
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:24,240
- 你的工具…又好又快
- 好的，谢谢
- Your equipment... Nice and fast.
- Ok, thanks.

105
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,097

This is a menu
from the last century, Alexandre.

110
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:53,203
我们需要一些原材料来降低价格
We need ingredients
to lower the prices

111
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:56,862
比如冷冻食物和微波炉食物
of our frozen food
and microwave meals.

112
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,174
这和我有什么关系？
How am I concerned?

113
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,412
你可以帮我们获得政府许可
You can help us
get government approval.

114
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,538
如果卡古·拉加德使用了这些食材

these ingredients,

115
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,756
我们就能得到
we'll get it.

116
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:11,518
我要为了你的股东而在我的食物中加这些垃圾？
I am to put that crap in my food
for your stockholders?

117
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,044
我的化学家说这毫无风险
My chemists say it's risk-free.

118
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,615
很多大厨与工业合作
Many big chefs work
with the industry.

119
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,146
- 再考虑一下
- 我已经考虑过了
- Think it over.
- I already have.

120
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,177
你看，你已经不适合待在这里了
You see?
You're out of place here.

121
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,273
这是西里尔

伦敦和巴黎的两星大厨

00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,334
还有用自由放养的鸡肉做成的冰块
and free-range
chicken ice-cubes.

126
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,276
令人吃惊！
Amazing!

127
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,878
我将要把卡古·拉加德给西里尔
I'm giving Cargo Lagarde to Cyril.

128
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,980
你会得到奥尔良的含羞草农舍
You'll take the Mimosa Farmhouse,
in Orléans.

129
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:46,457
看，那里多漂亮
Look how pretty it is.

130
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:49,950
对于你的传统菜肴来说是个绝佳的场所
A perfect setting
for your hearty traditional cuisine.

131
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,787
卡古·拉加德里有我的名字
Cargo Lagarde bears my name.

132
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,473
你的名字也是我们的，我们已经买下了
Your name is ours. We bought it.

133
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,360
你太贵了，不适合赚钱
You cost too much.
You're not profitable.

134

这次会面结束了

137
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,150
这就是现实，是这样的时代，没有其他的选择
It's how it is. It's the times.
No choice.

138
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:26,978
有人在敲窗

142
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,115
你们在煮鳕鱼

00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,991
用一个双层锅，最多10分钟

那么…
So...

152
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,716
我想做一份鲍鱼酱

155
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,437
他们甚至不知道他们吃的什么

what they eat.

156
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,414
昨天他们把鱼当成了鸡肉

they mistook fish for chicken.

157
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,748
如果你们听我的话

158
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,542
我们会达到烹饪的顶峰
we'll reach the peak
of culinary creation.

159
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:23,845
这又不是我们所追求的
That's not what we're after.

160
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,228
你给我们做了什么？

165
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,493
我们这个年纪的人知道自己喜欢什么！
At our age we know if we
like something or not!

166
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,612

别伤心，油漆工，这很正常
Don't worry, Paint Boy.
It's normal.

170
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,452
有次我被打就因为在煎蛋卷里放了奶酪
I once put cheese in an omelet
and I got bit!

171
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,051
是我的错，我太自大了
It's my fault. I see too big.

172
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,488
人们从不关心质量
People don't care about quality.

173
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,057
对不起，伙计们
Sorry, guys.

174
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,595

斯坦尼斯拉斯已经和我签了合同

268
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,524
这是什么？
What is it?

269
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:57,652
不可思议
Incredible.

270
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:00,522
就是这反应
That's the word.

271
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:04,491
我1996年的红鲣和南瓜食谱
My red mullet and pumpkin recipe
from 1996!

272
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,279
正是
Exactly.

273
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,570
不可思议，简直一模一样
It's wild. It's all there.

274
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:10,903
蔬菜的平衡
The balance of vegetables,

275
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,539
香料的协调，一切！
the harmony of spices.
Everything!

276
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,767
这是谁做的？
Who made this?

277
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,296
看到那个油漆工了吗？
See that painter there?

278
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,791
那个油漆工？
The painter?

279
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,992
打扰一下，可以聊一下吗？
Excuse me,
can we talk a bit?

280
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:37,940
这个96年的红鲣和南瓜和是你做的吗？
Is it you who made my recipe
for mullet and pumpkin from '96?

281
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,663
不，是97年的
No, '97.

282
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,692
96年是圣皮尔土豆泥
In '96 it was St.Pierre
and potato mousseline.

283
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:46,964
- 你确定？
- 绝对
- Are you sure?
- You bet!

284
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,510
对我来说，那食谱就像大卫之于米开朗基罗
For me, that recipe
was like Michelangelo's David.

285
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,511
有趣的比喻
Interesting analogy.

286
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:58,946
我需要一个副手
I need a second-in-command.

287
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,419
你愿意到卡古·拉加德来实习吗？
Would you work on a trial basis
at Cargo Lagarde?

288
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,114
我能拿到合同吗？
But I'll get a contract?

289
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,999
- 先试用，然后再决定
- 多久？
- A trial. Then we'll see.
- How long?

290
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,655
法律所规定的，一个月，两个…
Whatever the law says.
One month, two...

291
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,863
对不起，我不去
I'm sorry. I can't.

292
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:19,585
我在这有份6个月的合同，我妻子已经怀孕了
I have a 6-month contract here.
My wife is pregnant.

293
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,589
- 她会理解的
- 她不会的
- She'll understand.
- No, she won't.

294
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,394
你不能拒绝卡古·拉加德！
You can't say no
to Cargo Lagarde!

295
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,551
你是个白痴吗？
Are you a total idiot?

296
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,030
对不起，先生，我爱我妻子，仅此而已
No, sir. I love my wife.
That's all.

297
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,175
你们一个个的快要惹恼我了！
You're all starting to
piss me off. Big time!

298
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,395
拉加德先生，等等！
Mr. Lagarde, wait!

299
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,171
我接受你的提议
I accept your offer.

300
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,868
好吧…明早8点卡古见
Fine... Tomorrow at
8 at the Cargo.

301
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,995
你是对的，我会告诉我妻子真相的
You're right.
I'll tell my wife the truth.

302
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:49,845
当然…
Of course...

303
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,322
她会理解我的，为了一份免费的实习工作
she'll understand
that I left...

304
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,417
而放弃一份工作合约
a paid job for an
unpaid internship.

305
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,156
- 这是什么？
- 美丽的鲜花
- What's that?
- They're flowers.

306
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,892
- 你在这干嘛？
- 接你
- Why are you here?
- To pick you up.

307
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,574
我想让你知道你现在可以依靠我了
I like knowing
you can count on me now.

308
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,581
- 你被炒了？
- 没有的事
- You got fired?
- Not at all.

309
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:15,423
那是怎么回事
Something serious.

310
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,552
你到底要不要？
Do you want them or not?

311
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:21,161
当然，你抱着吧，我可是怀孕了
Of course I do. You carry them.
I'm a little pregnant.

312
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,641
猜猜发生了什么
Guess what happened.

313
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,101
我就知道发生了什么事情
I knew there was something.

314
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,658
是的，是发生了一些事情
Yeah, there was something.

315
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,122
猜猜谁夸奖了我
Guess who congratulated me.

316
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,344
谁？
Who?

317
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,564
亚历山大…
Alexandre...

318
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,462
养老院的经理
The manager of the
old-age facility.

319
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:46,461
他说我刷的很快，他想让我刷掉整个养老院
He says I paint fast.
He wants me to do the whole place.

320
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,536
对准了厨房？
Zeroing in on the kitchen?

321
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:54,598
没有，厨房远的很呢
You're crazy. The kitchen
is miles away!

322
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,130
别这样！
Stop it!

323
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,710
亚历山大！住手！
Alexandre! Stop this!

324
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,509
马特先生让我们来的！
Mr. Matter sent us!

325
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,488
下次我会把你们扔进冷藏室！
Next time I'll throw
you in the meat locker!

326
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,337
- 早，主厨
- 你迟到了
- Morning, chef.
- You're late.

327
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,577
- 才8：02
- 这就是我想说的，你迟到了
- It's 8:02.
- That's what I said. You're late!

328
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,478
珍妮！
Janine!

329
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,078
帮他的制服上绣上名字
Embroider his initials.

330
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,589
- 好的
- 我叫杰克·波诺
- Of course.
- It's Jacky Bonnot.

331
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,215
等下
Hold on.

332
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,528
只是想表达下谢意
Only normal.

333
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,842
"我想说的是，主厨
"I wanted to say, chef,

334
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,588
很感谢你给我的这个机会"
I am aware of the chance
you're giving me."

335
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,087
“实际上，当我还是个不懂事的孩子时
"Indeed, as a mere child,

336
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,892
您的菜谱对我来说就已经像项链上的珠子…”
your recipes were like
beads in a necklace..."

337
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,113
厨房见
See you in the kitchen.

338
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,879
好吧，我马上来
Okay.
I'll be right there.

339
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,762
那是马塞尔·布夏尔…
That's Marcel Bouchard...

340
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,445
- 给
- 谢谢
- Here.
- Thanks.

341
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,630
这个围裙要陪伴我很久了
This apron and I have
a long life ahead.

342
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,695
那就先从今天不被炒掉开始吧
Start by not getting
fired today.

343
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,361
注意了，所有人
Everyone,
your attention please.

344
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,120
尝下这个然后告诉我里面有什么
Taste this and tell
me what's in it.

345
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,310
- 要蒙住眼睛吗？
- 这里不是音乐厅
- Blindfolded?
- This isn't a music hall.

346
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,123
那么…
So...

347
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,608
烤大比目鱼
Roasted turbot.

348
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,492
配上菠菜酱
With a spinach coulis.

349
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,777
这个酱汁是…番茄和橄榄
The sauce is...
tomato and olive.

350
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:43,051
萝卜，盐黄油
Daikon radish,
salted butter.

351
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,768
我想应该再多加一点点盐
I'd have added a
pinch more salt.

352
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,448
很好
Very good.

353
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,282
这个闻起来像什么？
What does that smell like?

354
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,690
细嫩可口的烤牛肉
Confit of grilled beef.

355
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,554
精选的牛肉，完美的选择
Vintage Select Beef,
excellent choice.

356
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,338
西葫芦和土豆…
Zucchini and potatoes...

357
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,068
质地上乘
Lady Christels,
excellent texture.

358
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,709
他们在沸水里很稳定
They stay firm
in boiling water.

359
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,690
一点烤茄子…
A little grilled eggplant...

360
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,427
烤过头了
Over-grilled.

361
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,263
烤的太过了，如果要我说的话
Way over-grilled, if I may.

362
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,310
他是对的，这个茄子烤过头了
He's right.
This eggplant is over-grilled.

363
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,001
这是谁做的？
Who made this?

364
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,148
我
I did.

365
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,484
我告诉过你，茄子是很柔弱的
I've told you.
Eggplants are touchy.

366
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,607
别伤害它们，要紧盯着它们
Don't hurt them.
Look them straight in the eye.

367
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,662
我一直看着！
I looked it in the eye!

368
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,018
- 倒掉它
- 好的，主厨
- Toss it.
- Yes, chef.

369
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,425
显然你是不会犯这种错误的
Obviously,
you'd never have done that.

370
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,867
当然不会，我就好像听到那个茄子在尖叫一样
No, chef.
I'd have heard the eggplant scream.

371
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,793
杰克是一个蔬菜语者
Jacky is the vegetable
whisperer.

372
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,250
以及听众，这很重要
And listener.
That's important.

373
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,562
这个胡萝卜在说什么？
What's this carrot saying?

374
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,923
磨我
Grate me.

375
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,748
它想被磨碎
It wants to be grated.

376
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,338
- 磨掉它
- 是，主厨
- Grate it.
- Yes, chef.

377
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,045
做圣皮尔用
For the St. Pierre.

378
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:05,941
杰克今天会看你们工作，明天他会开始做事
Jacky will watch you work today.
Tomorrow, he'll run both services.

379
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,409
- 回去工作
- 是，主厨！
- Get to work.
- Yes, chef!

380
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,698
我被录用了，主厨？
So I'm hired, chef?

381
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:15,242
等到了忙时再说吧，很多人做不好
Wait until rush hour.
Many a man returns his apron.

382
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,833
- 不会是杰克·波诺
- 到时候就知道了
- Not Jacky Bonnot.
- We'll see.

383
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,242
这是什么？
What's this?

384
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:24,535
牛羊砸碎，扇贝，香草…
Sweetbread, scallops, vanilla...

385
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,143
忘了那些吧，制作菜谱是我的事情
Forget that.
I do the creating.

386
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:29,292
我是在想…
I was thinking...

387
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,173
了解
Got it.

388
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,865
我感觉非常好
I feel so good.

389
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,102
摸摸看…我们的孩子也在休息呢
Touch... Our baby is relaxed too.

390
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,556
这都要感谢全新的杰克
It's thanks to the new Jacky.

391
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,015
全新的杰克…
New Jacky....

392
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,463
别过火了
Don't go overboard.

393
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,740
我想告诉你…我辞职了
I meant to tell you...
I quit my job.

394
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,855
我已经和亚历山大·拉加德在一起3天了
I've been with Alexandre Lagarde
for 3 days.

395
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:13,153
这是一份实习，所以目前没有工资
It's an internship,
so unpaid for the moment.

396
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:15,893
对不起，我都快睡着了
Sorry, I'm half asleep.

397
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,307
你刚刚说了什么？
What did you say?

398
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,061
晚安，我全新的杰克…
Goodnight, my new Jacky...

399
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,573
- 怎样？
- 满座了，主厨
- How is it?
- Full, chef.

400
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,792
- 海蜇虾在哪？
- 来了！
- Where are the langoustines?
- Coming, chef!

401
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,248
鸡肉应该是要做好了！
The chicken should
be ready by now!

402
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,224
我的嫩煎小牛肉片还没好！
I still need my piccatas!

403
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:47,919
我知道了
I'll get them.

404
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,930
- 对不起
- 是我的错
- Sorry.
- My fault.

405
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,912
- 当心我的小牛肉片！
- 去重做一份
- Careful with my piccatas!
- Make another piccata!

406
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,190
去做4号桌的海蜇虾，我来做嫩煎小牛肉片
Do the langoustine for table 4.
I'll do the piccata.

407
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,469
这不是你该做的，催下鸡肉
It's not your job.
Check the chicken.

408
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:05,362
看啊！鸡肉不够
Look! It's not enough chicken.

409
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,116
你想让杰罗姆被训吗？多加一点
You want Jerome to get yelled at?
Add more.

410
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,848
把这里清理掉，嫩煎小牛肉片马上好
Clean this up, please.
Piccata, now.

411
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:12,950
当心背后！
Behind you!

412
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:18,138
做的很好，杰克，在卡古的第一周表现不错
Good work, Jacky.
Nice first week at the Cargo.

413
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,435
谢谢，主厨
Thanks, chef.

414
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,169
拉加德先生！我喜欢你的柠檬鸡！
Mr. Lagarde!
I love your lemon chicken!

415
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,530
但是你应该多用点柠檬
But you should
use more lemon.

416
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,371
你自己可以多加点！
Add it yourself!

417
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,548
对啊，我怎么就没想到呢！
Sure.
I hadn't thought of that!

418
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,372
5分钟后直播
<i>Live in 5 minutes.</i>

419
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,111
我们去哪？
Where are we going?

420
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,247
到布景那，录制我的节目
To the set.
To shoot my show.

421
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,599
不行！我不能做电视节目
No way!
I can't do a TV show.

422
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,558
如果我妻子看见了怎么办？
What if my wife sees?

423
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:41,266
她在工作，不会看电视的
She works.
She won't be watching TV.

424
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:43,279
那我的岳父母看见了呢？
What if my in-laws watch?

425
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,420
拍摄的时候能叫我布莱恩吗？
Can you call me Brian
while shooting?

426
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,217
欢迎收看我的节目“亚历山大市场”
Welcome to my show,
"Alexandre's Market".

427
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:56,889
我很高兴为大家介绍我的新助手
I'm happy to introduce you
to my new assistant.

428
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:00,934
这位是…
This is...

429
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,695
- 布莱恩
- 布莱恩
- Brian.
- Brian.

430
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:07,297
布莱恩，今天我们将要做的是法式烩小牛肉配春季蔬菜
Brian, this week we'll make
veal navarin with spring vegetables.

431
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:11,335
99年你在于泽斯的旅店时，菜单里的烩小牛肉？
The navarin from your 1999 menu
at the Inn in Uzès?

432
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,016
- 正是
- 棒极了
- Exactly.
- Excellent.

433
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,291
- 如大家所见，杰克…
- 布莱恩
- As you can see, Jacky...
- Brian.

434
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,950
布莱恩是一本鲜活的法式美食字典
Brian is the living memory
of French gastronomy.

435
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,062
- 为什么要带太阳镜？
- 那样就没人能认出他了
- Why the sunglasses?
- So no one recognizes him.

436
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,688
为什么装扮成这样上电视？
Why go on TV in that case?

437
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,239
想…匿名地被大家所认识
To be recognized but... incognito.

438
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:31,935
将小牛肋部的肉切成大块
<i>We cut the veal flanks
into nice chunks.</i>

439
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,397
同时，我，布莱恩，削好胡萝卜
<i>In the meantime,
I, Brian, peel the carrots.</i>

440
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,881
- 为什么要叫布莱恩？
- 他的美国名字
- Why Brian?
- His American name.

441
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,128
切好香葱
<i>Cut these chives.</i>

442
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,605
什么？你准备用香葱？
What?
You're using chives?

443
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:46,020
你的食谱用的是龙嵩叶
Your recipe calls
for tarragon!

444
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,901
我们在直播，杰克真爱搞怪
We're shooting live.
Jacky's a real clown.

445
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:52,591
不是杰克，是布莱恩，而且我很认真
Not Jacky. Brian.
I take your navarin very seriously.

446
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,458
好吧，那就不用香葱
So no chives.

447
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,226
让我们用…
Let's use...

448
00:26:58,343 --> 00:26:59,442
用一些百里香
some thyme!

449
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,947
我们不能用百里香！别随便更改你的拿手菜！
We won't use thyme!
Don't alter your masterpiece!

450
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,858
他们是真的在争吵吗？
Is this a real fight?

451
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,906
- 谢谢，布莱恩，你可以走了
- 我想尝尝这炖小牛肉
- Thanks Brian. You can go.
- I want to taste the navarin.

452
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:14,066
- 没有香葱或百里香果然更好
- 闭嘴
- Better without chives or thyme.
- Shut up.

453
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,527
女士们先生们，祝好胃口，下星期再见
Ladies and gentlemen, bon appétit.
See you next week.

454
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,988
再多点龙嵩叶或许更好
A bit of tarragon
would have helped.

455
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,551
闭嘴
Shut your trap.

456
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,886
今晚我就做炖小牛肉了
I'm making a navarin tonight.

457
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,760
谢谢
Thank you.

458
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:31,112
- 以后不要再这样了
- 我保护了你的食谱
- Never again.
- I defended your recipe.

459
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,957
亚历山大，节目真棒
Alexandre, that was wonderful!

460
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,089
你们两个配合真不错
That was some routine, you two!

461
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,525
我重新看了下你的合同
I reread your contract.

462
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,398
我知道该怎么从卡古·拉加德解雇你了
I know how to fire you
from Cargo Lagarde.

463
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,906
如果你失去一个星级
If you lose one star,

464
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:50,796
你就会被解雇
you're fired.

465
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:52,687
我永远不会失去的
I'll never lose one.

466
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,700
我认识所有米其林指南的老板
I know all the owners
of the guides.

467
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:59,295
两个美食评论家就要来卡古·拉加德了
Two critics are going
to Cargo Lagarde soon.

468
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:02,676
如果不走运…他们正巧不喜欢你的菜肴
Tough luck...
They don't like your cuisine.

469
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:06,436
你的三星就危险了
I'm not sure you'll keep
your three stars.

470
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,496
我差点忘了
I almost forgot.

471
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,260
如果你离开了卡古，你的公寓也就没了
If you lose Cargo,
you lose your apartment.

472
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,935
那是我们的，再见，亚历山大
It's ours.
Bye, Alexandre.

473
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:18,174
你们两个玩的开心哈！
Have fun you two!

474
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,865
- 振作点，会过去的
- 你在干嘛？
- Chin up. It'll be fine.
- What are you doing?

475
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:29,484
- 安慰你
- 安慰我？
- Comforting you.
- Comforting me?

476
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:30,938
因为…
Because...

477
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:34,594
- 闭嘴，给我回去工作
- 好的，主厨
- Get to work and keep quiet.
- Yes, chef.

478
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,583
再见，主厨
Goodbye, chef.

479
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:48,649
斯坦尼斯拉斯·马特来找了所有的供应商
Stanislas Matter came
to see all the suppliers.

480
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,388
如果我们再卖给你，他就不从我们这买东西
If we sell to you,
he won't buy from us.

481
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:54,977
那个混蛋，我该怎么办那？
That bastard. What do I do now?

482
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,704
别担心
Don't worry.

483
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,632
我永远不会忘记你的帮助的，我会帮你
I'll never forget your aid.
I'll help you.

484
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:02,264
谢谢，马可，你才是真正的朋友！
Thanks, Marco. What a friend!

485
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,328
朱利安！
Julien!

486
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,657
这是朱利安，以后他会做采购
This is Julien.
He'll be doing the shopping for us.

487
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:09,453
这是马可
This is Marco.

488
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,423
蒂博，过来
Thibault, come here.

489
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:18,977
在这羊肉酱里加点肉桂和一片荷花叶
Add cinnamon and a lotus
leaf to the lamb sauce.

490
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,250
- 我们不能改他的食谱
- 这是他的创作
- We can't change his recipes.
- They're his creations.

491
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:24,786
他全权委托给我了
He gave me carte blanche.

492
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:26,573
- 不行！
- 这样味道会很好
- But I can't!
- It'll be great.

493
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,166
过来
Come here.

494
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,101
- 照他说的做
- 他会被教训的
- Do it.
- He'll be furious!

495
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,214
- 亚历山大会炒了他
- 小滑头
- He'll fire him.
- Little prick.

496
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,085
好注意，我照做
Good idea. I'll do it.

497
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,610
在8号桌有两个客人，看上去像是美食家
I have two people at table 8.
Critics, I think.

498
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:47,543
只是在品尝
Not eating, just tasting.

499
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,501
他们不停问问题，还点了羊肉
They ask questions.
They ordered the lamb.

500
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:52,276
然后？
And?

501
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:55,131
你的副手改了食谱
Your second-in-command
changed the recipe.

502
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,174
什么？
What?

503
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,179
你会付出代价的
You're going to
pay for this.

504
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,174
就是他们
There they are.

505
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,262
东西怎样？
How's everything?

506
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,222
拉加德先生，都很美味
Mr. Lagarde, it's delicious.

507
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,519
我曾经吃过你的羊肉，然后…
I tried your lamb
once before and....

508
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,131
然后？
And?

509
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:26,639
加点肉桂真是天才的想法
Brilliant idea to have added
cinnamon.

510
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,314
肉桂？
Cinnamon?

511
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:32,302
我认为肉桂把味道混合的很不错…
I thought the cinnamon might make
for an interesting twist...

512
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,168
里面还有另外一种风味
There's another flavor too.

513
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:37,869
我一时间尝不出来
I can't put my finger on it.

514
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,609
- 他不会说的
- 对…他不会说的
- He won't say.
- No... he won't say.

515
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,659
- 荷叶，是吗？
- 荷叶，棒极了
- Lotus, right?
- Lotus, bravo.

516
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:48,894
我喜欢口味上的不同
I like some conflict
in the flavors.

517
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:50,601
简直美妙
It's crazy.

518
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,028
巴黎的人们对你的评价
What people in Paris
say about you.

519
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,465
“他总是一成不变”
"He repeats himself."

520
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:56,201
“只是个商人而已”
"Just a businessman."

521
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,524
他们都太刻薄了，你仍然是最好的厨师
They're mean.
You're still the best.

522
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:01,105
- 最顶尖的！
- 谢谢，谢谢
- Tops!
- Thank you, thank you.

523
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:03,621
亚历山大…我不知道该不该…
Alexandre... if I may...

524
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,519
我听说米其林指南的美食家
I've heard that critics from Le Guide

525
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,758
在你介绍新菜单的时候会过来
are coming the day you introduce your
new menu.

526
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,478
4月12号，我想是
April 12th, I think.

527
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:15,129
米其林指南？谢谢你告诉我这些
Le Guide?
Thanks for telling me.

528
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:18,088
比瑟隆和玛夏尔，他们不喜欢传统菜肴
Busseron and Marchal.
They hate classic cuisine.

529
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,540
如果让我说的话：给他们做点时髦的
If I may be so bold:
make them a molecular dish.

530
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:24,098
用上液氮，透明的那种
With liquid nitrogen.
Transparent.

531
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,910
- 这是他们喜欢的
- 分子菜肴？
- It's their thing.
- Molecular cuisine?

532
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:29,519
不行
Not that.

533
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,980
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is this?

534
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:37,362
肉桂？荷叶？你竟敢改我的食谱？
Cinnamon? Lotus?
You're changing my recipes?

535
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,394
你在东京四季时做菲力牛排用了同样的酱汁
You served the same sauce
with filet mignon

536
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,344
都有肉桂！
at the Tokyo Four Seasons.
It had cinnamon!

537
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,962
你不能拿羊肉和野味比较！
But you can't compare lamb
and venison!

538
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,038
我只是在诠释你的创作
I was interpreting you.

539
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:51,274
我把新的亚历山大料理和旧的亚历山大酱料配合在了一起
I tied a new Alexandre dish
to an old Alexandre sauce.

540
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,386
亚历山大说了，别在
Alexandre says to stop
making connections

541
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,747
亚历山大和亚历山大之间做任何的联系了！懂吗？
between Alexandre and
Alexandre! Understand?

542
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,453
不好意思，但是我知道亚历山大是怎么样的
Excuse me,
but I know how Alexandre works.

543
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:06,127
- 但是我就是亚历山大！
- 那又如何？有什么关系吗？
- But I'm Alexandre!
- So? How does that matter?

544
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,768
我从一开始就跟随着亚历山大
I've followed Alexandre
since day one.

545
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,555
你想听真相吗？
You want the truth?

546
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,212
在夏洛特离开前，亚历山大比现在好多了
Alexandre was better
before Charlotte left.

547
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,118
夏洛特？
Charlotte?

548
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,625
我的前期？干嘛把她扯进来？
My ex-wife?
Why drag her into this?

549
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:20,357
自从她离开后，你的酱料就停滞不前了
Since she left,
your sauces are stagnant.

550
00:32:20,882 --> 00:32:22,221
没人这么说过
No one says it,

551
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,367
但是…你的酱料遇到瓶颈了
but...
you're in a sauce rut.

552
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,802
别扯夏洛特
Leave Charlotte out
of my veal stock!

553
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:29,343
就这样吧，我受够了
This is over.
I'm fed up.

554
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,498
- 你走吧！
- 什么？你要解雇我？
- Get lost!
- What? You're firing me?

555
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,873
是的！试用结束了
Yes!
End of apprenticeship.

556
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,345
好吧…
Okay...

557
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,450
没问题
No problem.

558
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,011
想要杂碎和扇贝的灵感吗？
Want inspiration
for sweetbread and scallops?

559
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,534
我知道亚历山大会怎么做
I know what Alexandre
would have done.

560
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:48,873
食谱是我设计的！
I do the creating here!

561
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,727
再见，拉加德先生
Goodbye, Mr. Lagarde.

562
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,524
- 继续工作！
- 是，主厨！
- Keep scrubbing!
- Yes, chef!

563
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,516
波诺先生？
Mr. Bonnot?

564
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:11,756
主厨想问你，亚历山大会怎么做杂碎？
Chef asks how Alexandre
would do the sweetbread.

565
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,715
用接骨木醋溶解肉粒
Deglazed, with elderberry vinegar.

566
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,047
溶化，接骨木
Deglazed, elderberry.

567
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:19,594
他想让你回去
He wants you to come.

568
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,292
也不算很快嘛
Not too soon.

569
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,190
加接骨木醋
The elderberry vinegar now.

570
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,215
干嘛笑的这么傻？
Why the dumb smile?

571
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,007
这是我第一次被重新雇用
The first time
I've ever been rehired.

572
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,537
尝下
Go on.

573
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,793
- 你是对的，你个笨蛋
- 当然
- You're right, you idiot.
- You bet.

574
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:58,658
好吧…
Okay...

575
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,688
我们会一起做这个菜单，但是…
We'll do the menu
together, but...

576
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:03,959
你也是一个笨蛋！
You can be
a real dipshit too!

577
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:07,340
对不起，亚历山大…我在讲电话
I'm sorry, Alexandre...
I'm on the phone.

578
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:11,111
常，蝴蝶结面是有嚼劲的，你煮过头了！
Chang, farfalle are done al dente.
Yours are overcooked!

579
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,124
好吧，我不知道
<i>Okay. I didn't know.</i>

580
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:15,405
重新来过，煮9分钟
Start over.
Let it boil 9 minutes.

581
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,963
记住，不停的搅拌…
And remember,
stir, stir, stir...

582
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,251
- 这是什么？
- 我在帮养老院
- What's this?
- I'm helping at the old-age home.

583
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,214
你在同时做两份工作
So at lunch
you were working both jobs?

584
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,103
那些老人喜欢我的菜，我不能就这么放手
The residents love my recipes.
I couldn't just vanish.

585
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:30,971
我不想惹麻烦
I come in peace.
I want no trouble.

586
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:36,394
我只是让西里尔和他的装潢师参观我的餐厅
I'm just showing my restaurant
to Cyril and his decorator.

587
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:38,653
离开我的厨房
Leave my kitchen.

588
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,034
好吧
Very well.

589
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,963
这是拉维尼先生，法院执行官
This is Mr. Laveine, court bailiff.

590
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:48,370
他会告诉你我可以参观我的餐厅
He'll tell you I can visit
without danger, my restaurant

591
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,786
并重建
to have it redone.

592
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,005
当然，如果你失去一颗星的话
If you lose a star.
Of course.

593
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:54,885
- 这些都不要吗，马特先生？
- 对，所有的
- This goes, Mr. Matter?
- All of it.

594
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,831
那里要放抛光的陶瓷
And that will be
polished ceramic.

595
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:00,401
敲掉墙，让空间大点
Lose the wall, open it up.

596
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,421
客人们在这里吃饭
The customers eat
here and there.

597
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:06,347
这里我想要一个大的台屏
Here I want
a large table-screen.

598
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,920
扇贝？好主意
Scallops?
Good idea.

599
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:11,231
想从它里面找到食谱？
Find the recipe in Elle?

600
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,197
看来我掌管卡古只是时间问题了
It's about time
I see to the Cargo.

601
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,765
西里尔，跟我走
So, Cyril, come with me.

602
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,094
来看看冷库
Come see the
winter garden.

603
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:24,477
我们要拆掉这些门，我们需要空间
We'll lose the doors.
We need space.

604
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,391
太过时了！
Too old-fashioned!

605
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,952
- 你会失去一颗星？
- 有可能
- Can you lose a star?
- It can happen.

606
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:32,119
回去工作
Let's get back to work.

607
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,698
杰克！我把柠檬酱烧糊了
<i>Jacky!
I burnt the lemon sauce.</i>

608
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:37,032
另找个锅子重新开始
Get another pan
and start over.

609
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,744
比阿特丽斯刚打电话来，她没找=到你
<i>Beatrice called here.
She couldn't reach you.</i>

610
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:43,220
她想给你看点婴儿用品
<i>She has baby stuff
to show you.</i>

611
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:45,915
是吗？我会打她电话的
Oh yeah?
I'll call her back.

612
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,662
我在找杰克
I'm looking for Jacky.

613
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,961
他不久前辞职了
He quit here a while ago.

614
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,993
真的？
Really?

615
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:00,368
- 去问问厨房吧
- 厨房？
- Go ask in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

616
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,025
首先，让大豆浸泡在柠檬…
<i>First, let the soy beans
marinate in the lemon...</i>

617
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:07,868
有人告诉我说我能在这找到杰克
I was told I'd
find Jacky here.

618
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,148
他辞职了，找他干嘛？
He quit.
What's it about?

619
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,654
- 他在哪？
- 别告诉他妻子！
- Where is he?
- Don't tell his wife!

620
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,689
在屏幕上
On the screen.

621
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,849
- 你是？
- 他的妻子
- And you are...?
- His wife.

622
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,087
她要过来了？那我们得当心点
She's coming?
So we better watch out.

623
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,265
- 我就是她的妻子
- 噢…完了
- I'm his wife.
- Oh... shit.

624
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,039
你是怎么告诉比阿特丽斯的？
What did you tell Beatrice?

625
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,961
我和她说了你的小三
About your hookers.

626
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,068
关掉
Cut it out.

627
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,914
我说你有事出去了10分钟
I said you had
10 minutes of errands to do.

628
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:34,058
你是笨蛋吗？我怎么在10分钟内回来？
Are you stupid?
How do I get back there now?

629
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:36,916
我得找个理由打给她了！
I have to call her
and find an excuse!

630
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,868
杰克当心!
Jacky watch out!

631
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:40,889
等下
Just a sec.

632
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:45,812
我妻子的铃声也是这样的
My wife has the
same ringtone.

633
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:48,344
- 嘿，亲爱的…
- 怎么了？
- Hey, baby...
- Yeah?

634
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:49,970
- 你还好吗？
- 当然
- You okay?
- Yeah.

635
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:53,031
我就是想告诉你别来我工作的地方了
I'm just calling to say
don't bother coming by work.

636
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,157
我这堵车去不了了
<i>I won't make it.
I'm stuck in traffic.</i>

637
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,262
- 在哪？
- 民族广场附近
- Where?
- Not even that far... By Nation.

638
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:02,242
我也在附近，你在哪？
I'm near Nation too.
Where exactly?

639
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,456
你看不到我的，我在左边…
You can't see me.
I'm on the left...

640
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,180
在几辆卡车后面
<i>stuck behind
some trucks.</i>

641
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,066
等等，走啊！
Hold on. Move!

642
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,994
我也要去工作！让我过去！
I have to work too!
Let me through!

643
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,468
对不起…我开始走了
I'm sorry...
It's starting to move.

644
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:18,694
我在伏尔泰大道上了，我听到了回音？
I'm at Boulevard Voltaire.
I hear an echo.

645
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,739
你怎么在那？
<i>Why do I see
you there?</i>

646
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:25,936
- 你在哪？
- 杰克，你妻子在这
- Where are you?
- Jacky, your wife's here.

647
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,575
- 为什么这样做？
- 什么？我什么都没做啊
- Why do this?
- Do what? I did nothing.

648
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,997
很好，你把我当成个白痴
Right.
You think I'm an idiot.

649
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,576
- 我受够了， 我们玩完了
- 比阿特丽斯，等等！
- I'm sick of this. It's over.
- Beatrice, wait!

650
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,849
听着！常，做点什么！
Listen!
Chang, do something!

651
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,251
- 他没去找妓女！
- 不是那个！
- He didn't go to see hookers!
- Not that!

652
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,736
亲爱的，听我解释，你不能就这样离开了
<i>Honey, listen to me.
You can't leave like this!</i>

653
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,278
你麻烦大了
<i>You're in deep shit.</i>

654
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,608
你的手下真是个笨蛋
Your boy's a real champ.

655
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,783
有他在就不愁降星级了
With him it'll be
shooting stars.

656
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,737
他们经过，只是不停留而已
They pass by.
They don't stay.

657
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:00,427
他们只是路过
They just shoot on by.

658
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,581
再见了，三星级
So long, stars.

659
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,487
还是自动录音
Answering machine again.

660
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,188
她不在家
She's not home.

661
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:12,118
别打了，这没用的
Stop calling.
It won't get her back.

662
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:15,636
我欺骗了她，她永远不会原谅我了
That's not it. I lied to her.
She'll never forgive me.

663
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,448
- 我知道
- 他们都一样
- I know her.
- They're all the same.

664
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:22,670
她们想要嫁个好男人，但是只要一搞砸…
They want to marry a great man
but at the first screw up...

665
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,505
她们就离开了
they're gone.

666
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,079
你知道吗？
You know what?

667
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:29,258
她提过很多次想要结婚
She mentioned marriage a lot

668
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:32,390
但是每次我就像个白痴一样说：“还没到时候”
and each time like an idiot
I said "not now".

669
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:40,058
那么，你觉得如何？
So?
What do you think?

670
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,114
- 这很顺口
- 是啊
- It's flat.
- Yeah.

671
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:47,143
你有尝过白马庄园的葡萄酒吗？
Have you ever tasted
a Cheval Blanc?

672
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,727
没
Nope.

673
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,408
61年的白马庄园
Cheval Blanc '61 .

674
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,626
太棒了
Just wonderful.

675
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,811
接骨木醋先生，他毕竟不是全知全能的
He doesn't know everything,
Mr. Elderberry Vinegar.

676
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,407
尝尝这个
Taste this.

677
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,831
看这色泽
Check out the color.

678
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,375
闻闻这酒香
Smell that bouquet.

679
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,104
简直让我落泪，白马庄园
It brings tears to my eyes,
a Cheval Blanc.

680
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,228
我也是
Me too.

681
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,498
我快热泪盈眶了
My eyes are welling up.

682
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,841
美食家4天后就来了
The critics come in 4 days.

683
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,864
我完蛋了
I'm cooked.

684
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,978
干嘛这样说？会有机会的
Why do you say that?
It'll be another triumph.

685
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,760
他们是分子菜肴的死忠
They're disciples
of molecular cuisine.

686
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:32,738
- 分子菜肴？
- 再见了，三星级
- Molecular cuisine?
- Goodbye, 3rd star.

687
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:37,133
尝过柏图斯的酒吗？
Ever tasted a Petrus?

688
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:39,074
没有
Neither.

689
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:42,866
- 那白马酒庄呢？
- 以后再喝吧
- And the Cheval Blanc?
- Later!

690
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,761
有了
I've got it!

691
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:47,826
我认识些人
I know someone.

692
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:50,711
一位西班牙的新式菜肴专家
A Spanish specialist
in miocailulaire cuisine.

693
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,497
他是最棒的
He's our man. The best.

694
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:54,457
他有名吗？
Is he well-known?

695
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,626
有人说他是个天才
I was told he's a genius.

696
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:59,308
我来打给他，胡安·卡斯提拉
I'll call him.
Juan Castella.

697
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,150
我还有他的号码
I still have his number.

698
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:04,610
自动留言
Answering machine.

699
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,495
嗨，胡安，我是杰克·波诺
Hello, Juan.
This is Jacky Bonnot.

700
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:10,792
我现在和亚历山大·拉加德一起工作
I'm working now
with Mr. Alexandre Lagarde.

701
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,243
我们需要你
I think we need your skills.

702
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:16,384
尽快回我电话
Call me back.
'As fastas as possiblo'.

703
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,325
谢谢
Thank you very much.

704
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,849
谢谢你为我做的一切
Thank you for what
you're doing for me.

705
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,201
这是我的荣幸
It's an honor.

706
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,584
如果我能保住三星
If ever I keep the
three stars,

707
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,999
你就是副主管了
you'll be
second-in-command.

708
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,328
真的？
Really?

709
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,393
- 我更喜欢…
- 握手
- I'd prefer...
- Shake.

710
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,230
“左右手”
..."right-hand man."

711
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:40,837
“第一助理”也不错
"First assistant"
isn't bad either.

712
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:42,765
好吧，第一助理
Okay, first assistant.

713
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,335
“代理主厨”是不是更好？听起来…
Is "deputy chef" better?
It sounds...

714
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,011
- 你到底想不想握手了？
- 对不起
- Will you shake?
- Sorry.

715
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:51,350
- 来点白兰地吧
- 当然！
- Let's have some Armagnac.
- Sure!

716
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,055
她在纳维尔！
She's in Nevers!

717
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,561
我要像她求婚
I'll go ask her
to marry me.

718
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,592
比阿特丽斯在纳维尔她爸妈那
Beatrice went to her
parents house in Nevers.

719
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,688
我要走了
I'm abandoning you.

720
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,430
我不能没有她
I can't live without her.

721
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,197
我理解
I understand.

722
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,204
我送你过去
Let me drive you there.

723
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,297
那么…
So...

724
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:22,330
首先，告诉她我们已经有合同了
first, tell her
we're signing a contract.

725
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:23,875
我会安排的
I'll manage.

726
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:27,704
我过去和她谈，她会进我的怀抱的
I go, I talk,
she falls into in my arms.

727
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,991
开个玩笑
Just kidding.

728
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,405
我会帮你做好铺垫的
I'll just pave the way.

729
00:41:36,612 --> 00:41:38,502
好地方，纳维尔
<i>Neat place, Nevers!</i>

730
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:41,071
就在这…前面右转
<i>It's here...
Turn up ahead.</i>

731
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,470
如果他们不在家，那就肯定在这
If they're not home,
they're here.

732
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:48,619
走
Let's go.

733
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:50,721
这边
This way.

734
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,651
她在那
That's her.

735
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:58,137
她太美了
But she's beautiful!

736
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:00,204
嘘！
Duh!

737
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,868
跟着我
Follow me.

738
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:03,716
什么？
What?

739
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,999
我没有戒指！
I don't have a ring!

740
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:10,951
- 我们不能空着手去
- 我该怎么办？
- We can't go empty-handed.
- What do I do?

741
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:15,963
我会做些她喜欢的东西，她会原谅我的
I'll whip up something she likes.
She'll forgive me.

742
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,906
去掉这些…然后…
Get rid of this... Next...

743
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,104
杰克，你在这干嘛？
Jacky, why are you here?

744
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:25,531
嗨，卡罗尔
Hello, Carole.

745
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:29,366
我想给比阿特丽斯一个惊喜，拜托别告诉她
It's a surprise for Beatrice.
Please don't say a word.

746
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,482
就当在家里一样
You're at home here.

747
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,620
这是亚历山大·拉加德
This is Alexandre Lagarde.

748
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:36,239
亚历山大，这是卡罗尔，这里的主人
Alexandre, Carole, the owner.

749
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,781
拉加德先生…真是荣幸
Mr. Lagarde... it's an honor.

750
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,129
是我的荣幸
The honor is mine.

751
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,192
真巧，我的厨师下个月就要离开了
What a coincidence.
My cook leaves next month.

752
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,828
你愿意的话，可以试用下我
If you want,
you can take me on a trial basis.

753
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:50,315
我可付不起你工资
You're too pricey for me.

754
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,120
我们是为了比阿特丽斯来这的！
Didn't we come
for Beatrice?

755
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:57,381
对…比阿特丽斯，对…
Yes... Beatrice, yes...

756
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,045
对不起，打扰了
Sorry to intrude.

757
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:07,274
我先介绍下我自己…
Let me introduce myself....

758
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:09,338
你是亚历山大·拉加德
You're Alexandre Lagarde.

759
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,146
对，就是我
That's right.
That's me.

760
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,202
比阿特丽斯，听着
Beatrice, listen,

761
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,873
我来这是想告诉你，都是我的错…
I'm here to say
it's all my fault...

762
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,903
是我造成了现在这局面
I brought about
this situation.

763
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:22,397
谢谢你能过来，但是我知道这不是因为你
Thanks for coming.
But I know it's not you.

764
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,471
告诉杰克我不会见他的
Tell Jacky I won't see him.

765
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,297
别这样说，他想告诉你些东西
Don't say that.
He has to tell you something.

766
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:29,094
我不想听！
I won't listen!

767
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,011
我想告诉你，如果一切顺利的话
I have to tell you
that if all goes well,

768
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,888
他会在卡古·拉加德全职工作
he'll work full-time
at Cargo Lagarde.

769
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,405
他想雇用杰克！
He wants to hire Jacky!

770
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,289
就要当爸爸的人不应该撒谎
A future father mustn't lie.

771
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:41,192
他太不负责任了
He's irresponsible.

772
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,101
- 这是事实
- 而且令人难以忍受！
- That's true.
- And unbearable!

773
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,546
是的，我也解雇过他
True. I even fired him.

774
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:49,625
你不是应该帮我说好话的吗？
Weren't you supposed
to defend me?

775
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:51,822
你在这干嘛？
Why are you here?

776
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,453
嗨，阿曼德…嗨，玛蒂尔德
Hello, Armand...
Hello, Mathilde.

777
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,586
亲爱的，对不起，求你原谅我
Honey, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

778
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:58,957
看看我做了什么
Look what I made.

779
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,288
你最喜欢的焦糖千层派
Your favorite.
Caramel mille-feuille,

780
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,394
小草莓，红浆果
tiny strawberries,
redcurrants,

781
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:06,599
- 小阿月浑子…
- 我不想要
tiny pistachios...
- I don't want it.

782
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,469
你喜欢的！看啊！
You do! Look!

783
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:11,634
我还做了一个香草甜心，知道为什么吗？
I made you a vanilla sugar heart.
Know why?

784
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,747
我爱你
I love you.

785
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,936
香草糖也没用！
Vanilla sugar won't work!

786
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,100
由你父母见证
Let me make of the most
of your parents presence

787
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,720
我郑重的问你
to ask you solemnly

788
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,176
愿意嫁给我吗？
if you'll marry me.

789
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,624
不是这样子的！现在不行！
Not like this!
Not now!

790
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,142
- 为什么不？
- 你欺骗了我！
- Why not?
- You lied to me!

791
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,441
好吧，我是欺骗了你，不是什么大不了的
Okay, I lied to you. No big deal.

792
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:37,617
我从来没有撒过谎
I never lied before.

793
00:44:38,162 --> 00:44:39,991
一次，但是那不算
Once.
But that didn't count.

794
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,138
我们还没真正在一起
We weren't
really together.

795
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,381
我不认为这是个求婚的好时机
I don't think it's
time to propose.

796
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,492
- 我们该走了
- 好吧，我们走
- We should be going.
- Sure, let's go.

797
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,871
我知道这不是好时机…
I know it's not
the right time...

798
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:04,089
我该怎么阻止蜜饯沉入面饼？
How do I stop candied fruit
from sinking into the batter?

799
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,342
把蜜饯加在面糊上不停的鞭打
Add the fruit to whipped batter
and keep on beating.

800
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:11,520
谢谢，拉加德先生
Thank you, Mr. Lagarde.

801
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:12,971
还有个办法
There's another school.

802
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,979
把面糊放进冰箱
Put the batter in the fridge
and the next day,

803
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:18,557
到第二天就可以直接放蜜饯了…
just add the
candied fruit...

804
00:45:21,697 --> 00:45:23,925
- 搞定了吗？
- 晚安，卡罗尔
- So did it work?
- Goodnight, Carole.

805
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,832
没事的，她爱他
It's all fine.
She loves him.

806
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:29,586
- 你叫卡罗尔？
- 是的
- Your name is Carole?
- That's right.

807
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,712
- 我叫亚历山大
- 我知道
- I'm Alexandre.
- I know.

808
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:34,330
- 我会考虑你的提议的
- 当然
- I may accept that offer.
- Of course.

809
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:36,889
再见
See you soon.

810
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:43,473
她真美
She's pretty.

811
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,328
我知道
I know.

812
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:48,342
不是比阿特丽斯，是卡罗尔
Not Beatrice. Carole.

813
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:50,562
我是说…她们都很漂亮
I mean...
they're both pretty.

814
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,946
但是卡罗尔…
But Carole...

815
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,453
你脸上有奶油
You have cream on you.

816
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,616
果仁糖不够
Not even enough praline.

817
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,497
别客气
Make yourself at home.

818
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,690
这个金帽子，是你的第一个奖品
The Toque d'Or,
your first trophy.

819
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:30,989
这是…
And this is the...

820
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,733
晚安，明天见
Good night.
See you tomorrow.

821
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:38,650
嘿，宝贝
Hey, baby.

822
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,901
还是我
It's me again.

823
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,706
我知道我不应该再打了…
I know I should
stop calling...

824
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,459
但是我做不到
but I can't.

825
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:50,733
所以…回个电话好吗？
So... call me back.

826
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,213
- 还在学习？
- 我得好好准备
- Still working?
- I have to be ready.

827
00:46:58,113 --> 00:47:00,813
这次我要失去一颗星了
This time I'm going
to lose a star.

828
00:47:01,143 --> 00:47:02,489
二星，三星，没什么区别
2, 3, same thing.

829
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,763
来看我答辩吧
But come for my thesis.

830
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,887
我就要失去三星了你还在扯那些没人读的俄国书
I may lose a star and you blab on
about Russian books no one reads.

831
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,177
去告诉大家
Go tell the rest
of the world,

832
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,310
以后再也没有松露摊鸡蛋吃了
no more scrambled
eggs with truffles.

833
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:17,211
看他们会不会哭
See how they cry.

834
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:19,973
- 你怎么变得这么自私？
- 你教我的
- How can you be so selfish?
- You taught me.

835
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:23,610
我是很少陪你，但是我让很多人感到快乐
I was never around.
But I made lots of people happy.

836
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:25,580
是的，其他人
Yeah, other people.

837
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:28,201
你永远只关心你的餐厅
It's always about
your restaurants.

838
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:31,075
我不打扰你了
I'll let you work.

839
00:47:33,165 --> 00:47:34,561
我才不管你
I don't care.

840
00:47:45,218 --> 00:47:47,490
除了在养老院工作
Besides working
at the Home,

841
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,438
我看不出他们有任何资质
I don't see how
they're qualified.

842
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:55,277
常在疯马乐队做过化妆，穆萨开过卡车
Chang did make-up at Crazy Horse.
Moussa drove trucks.

843
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,572
提提过去是铺瓷砖的
And Titi used to lay tiles.

844
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,822
我该让他们干嘛？
What should I
do with them?

845
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,838
我们需要员工
We need a crew here.

846
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:05,406
以及试验样品的小白鼠
And guinea pigs to try
the first samples.

847
00:48:05,923 --> 00:48:07,309
有医疗保险吗？
Got health coverage?

848
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,854
就是他了，我去开门
That's him.
I'll go answer.

849
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,480
亚历山大，这是胡安·卡斯特拉
Alexandre,
this is Juan Castella,

850
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:17,414
世界闻名的专家…
world-famous
specialist...

851
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,614
- 我可以说“世界闻名”吗？
- 当然
- Can I say "world-famous"?
- You can.

852
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,069
…在分子菜肴方面
...in molecular cuisine.

853
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,872
你好
Good day,

854
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:26,759
亚历山大·拉加德先生，很荣幸能见到你
Señor Alejandro Lagarde.
I am very honored.

855
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,381
我也是
So am I.

856
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,791
首先
First of all,

857
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,657
我想尝下你的“料理”
I will taste your "cousin-e".

858
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:37,060
我的表兄弟？
My cousin?

859
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:50,843
这是什么？
What is it?

860
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:54,048
海藻牛肉
Beef with seaweed
a surf and turf.

861
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,785
很不错，拉加德先生
Straight to problem,
Señor Lagarde.

862
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:00,416
让我们开始吧
Let's get to work.

863
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,045
处理下它们
Pluck them.

864
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,815
你从哪里弄到的？
Where did you get them?

865
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,578
野鸭，巴黎边上的树林里
Wild ducks.
From woods near Paris.

866
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,489
巴黎边上的树林？
Woods near Paris?

867
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:12,618
去处理下，现在
Pluck them.
Now.

868
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,614
还要鸭肉？
More duck?

869
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,537
要的，再加
More, more.

870
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,692
再加，多加点
Much more, much more.

871
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
要加足够多的鸭肉才能获得其中的精华

872
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:47,400
看什么看，快点工作！

873
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,922
很好，看
I am happy.
Look.

874
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,705
鸭肉在哪？
Where are the ducks?

875
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,643
我提取了鸭肉的精华
I undertook fragmentation
of duck

876
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:59,294
然后将味道还原进了这小方块中
and reconstituted taste,
into little cube.

877
00:49:59,856 --> 00:50:01,107
我要吃这个？
I should serve this?

878
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,884
他还没完成，现在他要…
He's not finished.
Now he'll work on...

879
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,471
用色彩装饰下
Artistic aspect.
The color.

880
00:50:07,116 --> 00:50:08,977
酱料，脆度
The sauces.
The crunchiness.

881
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,444
穆萨，提提，常！
Moussa, Titi, Chang!

882
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,722
过来下
Come have a look.

883
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,444
你们三个能不能…
Can you three...

884
00:50:18,006 --> 00:50:20,175
尝下这个？
- 鸭肉配柑橘苏打
taste this?
- Duck with quince cracker.

885
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,443
- 哪里？
- 那儿
- Where?
- There.

886
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:25,101
- 那些奶酪块？
- 鸭肉配柑橘饼干
- The cheese cubes?
- Duck and quince cracker.

887
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,175
柑橘和鸭子？
Quince and quacker?

888
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,948
你在那些小块里放了柑橘？
You put the quacking
in the cube?

889
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,206
你怎么做到的？
How did you do it?

890
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,527
别废话，快尝尝
It's time to taste it.

891
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,688
- 这样子正常吗？
- 我要记录下
- Is that normal?
- I take notes.

892
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:53,126
太多液氮了，要减少15克
Too much liquid nitrogen.
Reduce by 15 grams.

893
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,525
- 要我们停下吗？
- 还不行，继续
- Should we stop chewing?
- Not yet. Continue.

894
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,357
怎样？
So?

895
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,001
好像有只粉末的鸭子在里面成型
It's like a powdered duck
that takes shape inside.

896
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,106
有鱼肉的味道
It tastes fishy.

897
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:10,328
是的，你把鱼和鸭做一起了！
It's true.
You made fish with duck!

898
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,606
应该是冷凝器的问题
Must be problem
with condenser.

899
00:51:13,128 --> 00:51:14,865
我得检查下
I have to go check.

900
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:20,681
尝一下，拉加德先生
Taste, Señor Lagarde.

901
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,444
鸭肉的精华
The true essence of duck.

902
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:28,148
没有啊，这味道是…树莓
Not at all.
lt's... raspberry.

903
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,776
继续…继续尝
Continue...
Continue eating.

904
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,362
这是怎么回事？
What the hell?

905
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:38,101
别担心，拉加德先生，正常的化学反应
Don't worry, Señor Lagarde.
Normal chemical reaction.

906
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:40,412
正常是什么意思？
What do you mean, normal?

907
00:51:40,895 --> 00:51:42,096
够了！
Enough bullshit!

908
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,121
不想再试试其他神奇的食物了？
So no more magic food?

909
00:51:44,592 --> 00:51:46,473
不，够了！
No, no more magic food!

910
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:48,721
你太敏感了！
You, very hypersensitive.

911
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:51,366
我这就走！
Me leave!

912
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,808
这就对了，再见
That's right.
Goodbye!

913
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,358
我受够了，别再让我看见这些东西！
I've had enough.
No more ducks in cubes!

914
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:04,975
20年来的这些压力只是为了取悦三个美食家！
20 years of pressure
just to please three critics!

915
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,418
我不干了
I'm calling it quits.

916
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:09,435
你答应给我一份工作的
You promised me
a job contract.

917
00:52:09,991 --> 00:52:13,001
我们只有两天来开发这份见鬼的菜单！
We have two days to invent a menu
that's still a mystery!

918
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,383
这不可能做到！
It's not possible!

919
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:19,172
那西里尔·博斯呢？他一直处理的很好
And Cyril Boss?
He manages fine.

920
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,227
他是怎么做到的？
How does he do it?

921
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:23,690
我们怎么不去那尝尝？
Why don't we
go eat there?

922
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:25,879
我们可以知道…
We'll check it out...

923
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,745
我们品尝，学习，分析…
we'll taste, understand, analyze...

924
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:31,282
- 然后我们改造下
- 所有人都认识我
- And we reinvent.
- Everyone knows me.

925
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,390
我打过去说：“拉加德要订两个位置”？
I call and say:
"Table for two for Lagarde"?

926
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,759
“晚餐吗？”“不，来做间谍！”
"For dinner?"
"No, for spying!"

927
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,359
不可能
Nonsense.

928
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,582
- 没别的办法了？
- 我想不出来
- There's no solution?
- I don't see one.

929
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,094
- 主厨？
- 怎么？
- Chef?
- What?

930
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:52,513
常…过去是个化妆师
Chang...
He was a make-up artist.

931
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:54,677
那又如何？
And?

932
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,591
野武士先生，夫人

01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:37,173
快点，别迟到了
Hurry.
Don't be late.

1070
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:38,554
你不去吗？
You're not coming?

1071
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,683
你是对的
You're the one
who's right.

1072
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,055
失去爱，我们一无是处
Without love,
we're nothing.

1073
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:49,756
我该怎么做？
What do I do?

1074
01:02:51,758 --> 01:02:53,319
你怎么在这？
Why are you here?

1075
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:57,069
你不能饿着肚子去答辩！
You can't take a test
on an empty stomach!

1076
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,510
我给你做了杯相当浓的热巧克力
I made you a very intense
hot chocolate.

1077
01:03:01,107 --> 01:03:03,109
左下，我会给你弄好的
Sit down. I'll serve you.

1078
01:03:07,147 --> 01:03:10,290
记得吗？我们叫这“阿曼丁奶油”
Remember?
We called it "brioche à l'Amandine".

1079
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,665
每次考试你都会给我做
You'd make me one
for every exam.

1080
01:03:13,116 --> 01:03:15,521
那时候我为了快乐而做饭
Back then I cooked
for pleasure.

1081
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,985
然后我就只想着我的三星餐厅
Then I became the guy
with all the 3-star restaurants.

1082
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,571
我忘记了我的最爱
I forgot what I loved most.

1083
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:24,037
你…和烹饪
You and... cooking.

1084
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,252
他们呢？
Where are they?

1085
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:32,213
我得看你给考官们讲巴尔扎克抄袭哥萨克人
I must see you tell the jury
Balzac stole from Cossaks

1086
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:33,595
写成了“驴皮记”
for "The Magic Skin".

1087
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,254
你读了我的论文？
You read my thesis?

1088
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:37,823
- 你读了我的论文？
- 快吃
- You read my thesis?
- Eat.

1089
01:03:38,123 --> 01:03:39,552
你看过了？
You read it?

1090
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,626
三星级的
Three stars.

1091
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,961
怎么了？怎么什么都没有？
What's wrong?
Why is nothing ready?

1092
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:57,859
马可不卖东西给我们了
Marco stopped selling to us.

1093
01:03:58,394 --> 01:04:00,233
太晚了，只剩蔫掉的蔬菜了
It was too late.
Just wilted vegetables.

1094
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,696
你连对话都做不到的那种…
The kind...
you can't whisper to.

1095
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:05,432
什么？
What?

1096
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:08,885
我找亚历山大
I'm looking for Alexandre.

1097
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,454
他不在，他要晚点来
He's not here.
He'll be here later.

1098
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:13,153
可以让他打电话给我吗？
Will you tell him to call me?

1099
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:19,817
你想跟着我做吗？
Would you like
to work with me?

1100
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:23,680
不了，谢谢，亚历山大信任我，所以我…
No thank you.
Alexandre trusts me, and I'd...

1101
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:27,863
你太穷了，杰克，为自己考虑下
You're too pure, Jacky.
Think about yourself.

1102
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:31,306
亚历山大顽固守旧
Alexandre insists on living
in a bygone era.

1103
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:33,544
我不这么认为
I don't agree at all.

1104
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:37,100
他仍然是最好的，我会是他的副手
He's still the best.
And I'll be second-in-command.

1105
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,481
如果他保得住他的三星
If he keeps his three stars.

1106
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:42,891
但是，他人不在，又没东西，你能做什么？
But what will you do without him
and nothing to cook?

1107
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:45,741
焗芝士？
Grilled cheese?

1108
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,651
你高估自己了，你肯定会失败的
You overestimate yourself.
You can only fail.

1109
01:04:49,226 --> 01:04:51,286
或许吧，但是我还是想试一下
Maybe.
But I want to try.

1110
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:53,338
试什么？
Try what?

1111
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,074
你以为你会学着食谱做菜就是个主厨了？
You think you're a chef
because you follow recipes?

1112
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,725
你才不是！你只不过是个业余的！
You're not!
You're an amateur!

1113
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:03,797
这里是专业的地方
And this place is
for professionals.

1114
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:06,531
你有发明过什么吗?
Have you ever
invented something?

1115
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,663
鸡蛋含羞草还是提拉米苏?
Eggs mimosa or tiramisu?

1116
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:12,171
这些是你创的吗?
Was that you?

1117
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,041
你只是个模仿者而已
You're a copycat.

1118
01:05:14,513 --> 01:05:16,170
只是个唱卡拉OK的家伙
Just a guy who
sings karaoke.

1119
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:19,241
仅此而已
That's all.

1120
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:21,359
所以,回家去吧…
So go home...

1121
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:23,938
波诺先生
Mr. Bonnot.

1122
01:05:27,262 --> 01:05:28,637
好吧…
Okay...

1123
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:30,806
我们该怎么办？
What do we do?

1124
01:05:31,277 --> 01:05:32,633
什么都不做
Nothing.

1125
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:35,215
没有蔬菜，没有灵感，没有亚历山大
No vegetables, no ideas,
no Alexandre.

1126
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:37,965
- 还有我们
- 很好，但又能如何？
- We're here.
- That's nice, but so what?

1127
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,917
斯坦尼斯拉斯是对的
Stanislas is right.

1128
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:42,691
我只会模仿，我应该做我的油漆匠的
I just sing karaoke.
I should have stayed a painter.

1129
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,046
比阿特丽斯也就不会离开我了
Beatrice would
never have left.

1130
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,532
- 我要去找她
- 什么？
- I'll go find her.
- What?

1131
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:49,370
就这样了？
Is that all?

1132
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:51,633
我们为了你放弃了工作然而你却自己放弃了
We left our jobs for you
and you bail.

1133
01:05:52,263 --> 01:05:55,729
- 你会让我们失业的
- 你答应过我们
- You'll put us on unemployment.
- You promised us.

1134
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,527
对不起
I'm sorry.

1135
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,527
那家伙说对了，你确实不专业
That guy was right.
You're not professional.

1136
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:02,409
你只是为了快乐而做菜
You cook for pleasure.

1137
01:06:02,851 --> 01:06:04,517
专业的厨师是为了其他东西
Professionals do
it for others.

1138
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,818
我铺瓷砖可不是为了取乐
I wasn't laying
tiles for pleasure,

1139
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,460
但是地面因为我而平整
but so people's
floors were even.

1140
01:06:10,714 --> 01:06:12,203
电话，先生
Phone call, sir.

1141
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:14,413
- 亚历山大？
- 不是，一个女的
- Alexandre?
- No, a woman.

1142
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:17,192
谢谢
Thank you.

1143
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,233
- 是我
- 亲爱的…
- It's me.
- Oh baby...

1144
01:06:23,198 --> 01:06:24,813
真高兴能听到你的声音
I'm happy to
hear from you.

1145
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:26,611
我对自己太失望了
I'm so upset with myself.

1146
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:30,802
我欺骗了你，而且一无所获，我不该这样做的
I lied and I shouldn't have.
And for nothing.

1147
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:32,813
- 我们搞砸了
- 怎么会？
- We got screwed.
- How so?

1148
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:34,862
美食评论家在这，但是我们连材料都没
Critics are here and
we have no food.

1149
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:38,503
我相信你可以做好的，你最会做这种东西
I'm sure it'll be fine.
It's how you cook best.

1150
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:40,826
这次真的是什么都没有
This time there's
really nothing.

1151
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,300
我放弃了，我算是知道了
I'm calling it quits.
Now I know.

1152
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,194
烹饪不是我该做的
Cooking is not for me.

1153
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:49,543
这些只是借口！就拼一下又如何
You and your excuses!
Go all the way for once.

1154
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,726
不然你怎么知道自己的价值在哪？
<i>How else can you
know your worth?</i>

1155
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,214
你给我做的料理都那么棒
What you cook for
me is so amazing.

1156
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:56,863
你能行的
Your saving grace.

1157
01:06:57,326 --> 01:06:59,999
那是因为我爱你
Obviously for you
it was because I love you.

1158
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,900
就想象你是在为我做菜
Imagine you're
cooking for me.

1159
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:03,569
还有你女儿
And your daughter.

1160
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:07,444
真的？
Really?

1161
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,223
我有女儿了？
I have a daughter?

1162
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,365
我就过来！
I'm coming.

1163
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,893
先做完你该做的
Finish what you
have to do first.

1164
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,939
你确定？
Are you sure?

1165
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,158
别担心，我们等你
Don't worry.
We're waiting.

1166
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:21,752
再见
See you soon.

1167
01:07:26,385 --> 01:07:28,152
附近有超市吗？
Is there
a supermarket nearby?

1168
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:31,562
街角有个食品杂货店
Just a grocery
at the corner.

1169
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,198
做好准备
Start getting ready.

1170
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:37,647
把炉子热起来
Turn on the stoves.

1171
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,719
提提，烧水，穆萨，常，我们走
Titi, boil water.
Moussa, Chang, let's go.

1172
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:42,713
一起来
Come with me too.

1173
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:44,655
你们也一起来
You there, come along.

1174
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,958
伙计们…我做爸爸了！
Guys... I'm a daddy.

1175
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:49,210
我做爸爸了！
I'm a daddy!

1176
01:08:06,742 --> 01:08:08,869
有蔬菜吗？有番茄吗？
Some vegetables?
Nice tomatoes?

1177
01:08:09,158 --> 01:08:11,039
把所有的都弄出来，我都要了
Give me everything.
I'll take it all.

1178
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,166
蔬菜，水果，洋葱，番茄，洋蓟
Vegetables, fruit,
onions, tomatoes, artichokes

1179
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:17,556
菠萝，意面，米，面粉，鸡蛋，奶酪
pineapples, pasta,
rice, flour, eggs, cheese.

1180
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:19,314
整个店的东西
The whole store.

1181
01:08:19,331 --> 01:08:21,054
- 是上帝派你来的吗？
- 当然
- Did God send you?
- He sure did!

1182
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:28,752
别让他们吓到了
Don't let them scare you.

1183
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:31,118
柠檬汁是帮你润喉的
The lemon juice is
for your voice.

1184
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:34,079
好了，爸爸，这是我的考试，不是你的
Okay, Dad.
It's my exam, not yours.

1185
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:36,459
早饭给你能量
Breakfast will give
you energy.

1186
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:39,094
- 别太紧张了
- 我有吗？
- Don't overdo it.
- Am I?

1187
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,171
你都快变成直升机了
You're becoming
a helicopter dad.

1188
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:42,927
不对
Wrong.

1189
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,136
穿好毛衣，外面冷
Your sweater. It's cold.

1190
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,066
我先停车
I'll park first.

1191
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,215
这用来做肉汤和备料
This is for broths
and stocks.

1192
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:03,840
- 常，削胡萝卜
- 好的
- Chang, peel carrots.
- Right away.

1193
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:05,762
穆萨，切洋葱
Moussa, chop onions.

1194
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:08,137
提提，清洗蔬菜
Titi, blanch the vegetables.

1195
01:09:08,748 --> 01:09:11,246
一个半小时后介绍新菜单！
An hour and a half
to invent a new menu!

1196
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,806
一个半小时，这不可能！
An hour and a half.
It's impossible!

1197
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,638
但我们得试试，好吗？
But we'll give
it a try, okay?

1198
01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:21,779
你好像没能提到阿纳斯塔希拉·弗拉基米尔诺瓦纳
We regret your not mentioning
Anastasila Vladimrovna.

1199
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:24,019
谢谢，但是我觉得
Thank you, but I felt

1200
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:27,287
这和杜斯妥也夫司基这个章节无关
it was irrelevant
in a chapter on Dostoyevsky.

1201
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,942
杰拉德，我现在不能说话，什么？
Gerard, I can't talk.
What?

1202
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,655
马可这混蛋说他会送蔬菜的！
That bastard Marco said
he'd deliver the vegetables!

1203
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:38,698
我马上来…不好意思
I'm coming...
Excuse me.

1204
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,390
对不起，女士，但是…
I'm sorry, madam, but...

1205
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,533
对不起让你失望了，我得走了
Sorry to disappoint.
I have to go.

1206
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,638
餐厅有麻烦了，你做的很好
Trouble in the restaurant.
That was great work.

1207
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,949
我没全看过，但是我很喜欢
I didn't get it all,
but I liked it.

1208
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,642
我为你感到骄傲
I'm very proud of you.

1209
01:09:54,464 --> 01:09:55,593
对不起但是…
I'm sorry but...

1210
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:57,427
她很棒不是吗？我走了
Isn't she great?
I'm off.

1211
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:59,263
- 爸爸？
- 怎么了？
- Papa?
- What, what?

1212
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:01,049
谢谢
Thanks.

1213
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:03,094
因为早餐？
For breakfast this morning?

1214
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:05,081
早餐很好…晚点见
It was nice... See you later.

1215
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:12,717
我们继续吧，拉加德小姐…
Let's continue,
Miss Lagarde...

1216
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:21,118
不错，亚历山大确实能力非凡
Yeah, Alexandre had
a great reign,

1217
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,110
但是他从不做变化
but he hasn't evolved.

1218
01:10:23,746 --> 01:10:25,465
他的烹饪都快是史前遗物了
His cuisine is
pre-historical.

1219
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,162
我会保持安静的
I'll keep quiet.

1220
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:31,446
我不响影响你们
I don't want
to influence you.

1221
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,121
菜单
The menu.

1222
01:10:34,992 --> 01:10:36,204
那么？
So?

1223
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,608
今天他准备了些什么？
What has he
prepared for us?

1224
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,862
- 亚历山大！
- 保罗…你来了
- Alexandre!
- Paul... you came.

1225
01:11:01,578 --> 01:11:03,913
我从来没错过你的新菜单
I've never missed any
of your new menus.

1226
01:11:04,672 --> 01:11:07,046
你的油漆匠做了这份春季菜单
Your painter did
the Spring menu.

1227
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,673
他从哪找到的这些蔬菜？
Where did he find
the vegetables?

1228
01:11:11,815 --> 01:11:13,273
街角的杂货店
The corner grocer.

1229
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,090
我们死定了
We're dead.

1230
01:11:18,432 --> 01:11:21,722
你赶紧叫亚历山大·拉加德过来，这简直不可思议
You must call Alexandre Lagarde.
It's incredible.

1231
01:11:22,163 --> 01:11:23,684
我们想向他表示祝贺
We want to
congratulate him.

1232
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,716
我们从不知道他有能力
I don't remember him
capable of such subtlety

1233
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,761
将现代的东西结合的那么好
allied with
such modernity.

1234
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,545
他怎么能够将那么多的情绪融入其中？
How does he put so
much emotion in this?

1235
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,473
就像你一个女人子啊拥抱我，把我扔进一个浴盆
It's like a woman hugged me,
threw me in a tub,

1236
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:37,824
用热水帮我擦拭，然后…
sponged me down
with warm water, then...

1237
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:40,270
你们不这样觉得？
Not you?

1238
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:42,458
我对亚历山大很有信心
I expected as much
from Alexandre.

1239
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,852
我知道他一直被诽谤
I know that he's
constantly badmouthed

1240
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:47,710
但是对我来说他永远是最棒的
but for me he's always
been the best.

1241
01:11:48,561 --> 01:11:49,765
一直都是
Always.

1242
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:51,697
确实
It's true.

1243
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:54,368
亚历山大，我是斯坦尼斯拉斯，给我回电
Alexandre, it's Stanislas.
Call me back.

1244
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:59,998
美食家们想见亚历山大但是我找不到他
The critics want to see
Alexandre but I can't reach him.

1245
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:01,887
我该出去了
I'm going back out.

1246
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:03,945
告诉他们他在忙
Tell them he's
busy working.

1247
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,299
这些菜棒极了
These recipes
are magnificent.

1248
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:08,764
开始做乌贼，现在！
Start the calamar, now!

1249
01:12:09,277 --> 01:12:11,149
一半传统一半现代
Part traditional,
part molecular!

1250
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:13,234
我服了！
I'm floored!

1251
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:15,702
他怎么做到的？
How did he come
up with it?

1252
01:12:16,143 --> 01:12:17,192
我彻底服了！
I'm floored!

1253
01:12:17,714 --> 01:12:19,588
他们会为他发明第四个星级的
They'll invent a 4th
star for him!

1254
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:26,149
你在这？
You were here?

1255
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,425
- 你也在，马特先生？
- 我可以尝尝吗？
- You too, Mr. Matter?
- Can I taste?

1256
01:12:28,956 --> 01:12:32,268
- 爸爸，我不知道你会来
- 你不需要知道
- Dad, I didn't know you came.
- You didn't have to.

1257
01:12:32,903 --> 01:12:34,846
都是从杂货店买的？
Everything from
the grocery?

1258
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,757
所有我能买到的东西
All I could get
my hands on.

1259
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:39,935
你听到了吗？我想你成功了！
Did you hear?
I think you won!

1260
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,918
见到你实在是太高兴了
I am so, so happy
to see you.

1261
01:12:45,505 --> 01:12:47,674
来吧，他们在等你，这将是一次巨大的成功
Go on, they're waiting.
It'll be a triumph.

1262
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:51,437
我们之间的关系过去有点紧张
There was some tension
between us recently,

1263
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:53,442
但是过去的都是过去了
but all that's over now.

1264
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:57,734
我想让你继续待在卡古·拉加德
I want you to stay
at Cargo Lagarde.

1265
01:12:58,452 --> 01:12:59,532
我坚持
I insist.

1266
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:03,675
我去告诉大家你来了
I'll announce you.

1267
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:08,217
我想时间到了
I think the time has come.

1268
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,108
等等…
Hold on...

1269
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,582
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

1270
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:15,635
跟我来
Follow me.

1271
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:33,220
女士们先生们，感谢你们喜欢我的春季菜单
Ladies and gentlemen,
you enjoyed my Spring menu.

1272
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,563
非常感谢
And I thank you.

1273
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,483
但是…
But...

1274
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,298
我之前并不在这
I wasn't here earlier.

1275
01:13:40,864 --> 01:13:43,525
我在参加我女儿的论文答辩
I watched my daughter
defend her thesis.

1276
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,205
她通过了
She passed with honors.

1277
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:51,860
祝贺她
Thanks for her.

1278
01:13:52,352 --> 01:13:54,955
欢迎米其林指南的美食家们，低调地来到这里
Hello to the critics from Le Guide,
here incognito.

1279
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:56,321
没有
Not at all.

1280
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,188
杰克，过来，过来
Jacky, come here.
Come.

1281
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:04,996
女士们先生们，这为是杰克·波诺
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jacky Bonnot.

1282
01:14:06,752 --> 01:14:08,571
他创造了这份春季菜单
He created the Spring menu.

1283
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,758
谢谢，主厨
Thanks, chef.

1284
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:22,363
他现在是卡古·拉加德的新主厨了
He is the new chef
at Cargo Lagarde.

1285
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:24,508
是吗，斯坦尼斯拉斯？
Isn't he, Stanislas?

1286
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,749
嗯…当然
Umm... yes.

1287
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:32,678
我在寻找一位继任者，然后我找到了他
I was looking for a successor.
And I found him.

1288
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:36,173
所以我在这里告诉大家…
This is why
I'm telling you...

1289
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:38,559
我不再追逐星级了
I'm done chasing stars.

1290
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:40,993
那你准备做什么？
What will you do?

1291
01:14:41,454 --> 01:14:42,945
很快你就会知道的
You'll know soon enough.

1292
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:45,998
- 祝贺你
- 谢谢，主厨
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, chef.

1293
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:47,505
祝好运
Good luck.

1294
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,293
谢谢大家
Thank you all.

1295
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,933
你的有素千层糕简直太棒了
Your mille-feuille was great.

1296
01:14:57,712 --> 01:14:59,521
来，把这个给比阿特丽斯
Here, give this to Beatrice.

1297
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,359
这次会很顺利的
It'll go over better
this time.

1298
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,933
杰克·波诺是我的秘密武器
Jacky Bonnot is
my secret weapon.

1299
01:15:14,328 --> 01:15:15,758
先生们
Gentlemen,

1300
01:15:16,231 --> 01:15:19,089
我说过我有个惊喜，这就是杰克·波诺！
I said I had a surprise.
It's Jacky Bonnot!

1301
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:21,990
- 过来
- 好的，爸爸
- Come here.
- Yeah, Dad.

1302
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:24,221
我们跳过太多步骤了
We skipped too many steps.

1303
01:15:24,684 --> 01:15:28,354
在你掌管集团之前，先去学学怎么鉴别产品的质量
Before you take over the group,
learn to appreciate product quality.

1304
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,122
好吧，你是怎么想的？
Fine.
What were you thinking?

1305
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:33,374
我们会有办法的
We'll find something.

1306
01:15:33,756 --> 01:15:35,370
- 马特先生？
- 怎么了，朋友？
- Mr. Matter?
- Yes, my friend?

1307
01:15:35,773 --> 01:15:37,665
- 我可以那份工作合同吗？
- 现在？
- Can I have a job contract?
- Now?

1308
01:15:38,384 --> 01:15:40,402
我需要一份签字的合同，立刻
I need a signed contract,
right away.

1309
01:15:41,058 --> 01:15:44,113
- 照他说的做
- 当然，我马上给你签
- Do what he wants!
- Sure. We'll sign you on.

1310
01:15:44,493 --> 01:15:46,662
- 立刻
- 再给他签张支票
- Right away.
- Write him a check too.

1311
01:15:47,197 --> 01:15:48,718
我会给你张支票
I'll write you a check.

1312
01:15:49,282 --> 01:15:51,030
- 好吗？
- 太好了！
- Okay?
- Fine with me!

1313
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:53,695
太棒了，我刚刚做爸爸
Great timing.
I just become a dad.

1314
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:55,595
很好！
Wonderful!

1315
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,336
很晚了，我要去纳维尔看我的孩子
I'm late. I have to go to Nevers
to see my baby.

1316
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:02,607
把你的车也给他
Give him your car too.

1317
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:05,815
把你的车给他！
Give him your car!

1318
01:16:06,718 --> 01:16:08,239
谢谢
I'd like that.

1319
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,440
- 里面有汽油吗？
- 有
- Is there gas?
- Yeah.

1320
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:26,020
高级烹饪将会有大变化
<i>Haute cuisine will
never be the same.</i>

1321
01:16:26,633 --> 01:16:29,613
亚历山大·拉加德退出了“星级系统”
<i>Alexandre Lagarde has
given up "the star system".</i>

1322
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,670
他的班子现在
<i>His crew now works</i>

1323
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,662
为一位年轻的主厨工作，一位新人
<i>for a young chef,
a newcomer.</i>

1324
01:16:34,191 --> 01:16:35,832
我们尽量再去找更多的消息
<i>We tried in vain
to find out more.</i>

1325
01:16:36,377 --> 01:16:37,857
先生，能给我们介绍一下
<i>Sir, can you tell us</i>

1326
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,264
一些关于这位神秘的新主厨吗？
<i>about this mysterious
new chef?</i>

1327
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:48,939
- 嗨，杰克
- 嗨，安东尼
- Hello, Jackie.
- Hello, Antoine.

1328
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,595
- 买主厨的工作装？
- 是的！
- Buying your chef's outfit?
- Yes!

1329
01:16:53,546 --> 01:16:55,730
这里面随便拿20件给我的属下
And twenty of those
for my crew.

1330
01:16:56,355 --> 01:16:58,667
他们会打电话过来的，我想我该先告诉你下
They'll call.
I thought I'd tell you.

1331
01:17:00,518 --> 01:17:01,937
终于，安东尼！
So long, Antoine!

1332
01:17:02,311 --> 01:17:06,174
…杰克·波诺，年轻的厨艺天才
<i>...Jacky Bonnot,
young culinary genius.</i>

1333
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:43,082
- 你是父亲？
- 是的
- You're the father?
- Yes, I am.

1334
01:17:43,707 --> 01:17:44,880
祝贺你
Congratulations.

1335
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:48,438
这都是团队合作，应该归功于我的团队
It's all about teamwork.
I owe it to my crew.

1336
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,937
你是说…？不不不，这个是我自己完成的
You meant...?
No, for that I was all alone.

1337
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,687
我什么时候能给她做勃艮第炖牛肉
When can I make her
boeuf bourguignon?

1338
01:17:58,201 --> 01:17:59,917
两到三年
Two or three years.

1339
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:03,011
- 为什么要这么久？
- 她还是个婴儿
- Why so long?
- She's a baby.

1340
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:07,121
你来很久了？
Have you been
here long?

1341
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,006
她真漂亮
She's so beautiful.

1342
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:12,826
一切顺利吗？
Did it all go well?

1343
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:18,308
一份工作合同
A job contract.

1344
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:21,208
太棒了
Excellent.

1345
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:24,256
- 我必须得告诉你…
- 我也得告诉你
- I have to tell you...
- I have to tell you too.

1346
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:27,560
那你愿意嫁给我了？
So you'll be my wife?

1347
01:18:28,445 --> 01:18:31,501
真正的求次婚啊，这太无聊了
Propose for real.
This is all so lame.

1348
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:33,607
真正的求婚？
Propose for real?

1349
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,300
就像…
Like...

1350
01:18:36,906 --> 01:18:38,706
比阿特丽斯
Beatrice,

1351
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,794
我的挚爱
my love,

1352
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:43,045
你愿意嫁给我吗？
will you be my wife?

1353
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,968
我愿意！
I do!

1354
01:18:49,736 --> 01:18:51,021
等等
Hold on.

1355
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,904
告诉我，你第一次撒谎是什么时候？
Just tell me.
When was the first lie?

1356
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,545
为什么我们还没技术上在一起？
Why weren't we
technically together?

1357
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,531
技术上来说我记不清了
Technically I can't
remember too well.

1358
01:19:07,102 --> 01:19:08,363
大家好

杰克，我们要吃的！我们要吃的！我们要吃的…
Jacky, give us food!

1363
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:31,053

1366
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,153

感谢你非凡的技巧

extraordinary skills.

1371
01:19:57,216 --> 01:19:59,550
你不待在卡古·拉加德了
You're no longer
at Cargo Lagarde.

1372
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,211
为什么跑去纳维尔当厨师？
Why did you go and become
a cook in Nevers?

1373
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:05,389
纳维尔是个优雅的地方！
Neat place, Nevers!

1374
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:09,215
这里我们有一些录像

some neat images

1375
01:20:09,757 --> 01:20:11,937
关于你在新餐厅的工作

请享用
For you.

1377
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,125
请慢用您的午餐
Enjoy your lunch.

1378
01:20:20,127 --> 01:20:22,977
我在这…和卡罗尔一起
And here I am... with Carole.

1379
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:24,939
她是这的老板
<i>She runs the place.</i>

1380
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,356
我们决定在客人中间工作
We decided to work
amid everyone.

1381
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:30,736
我感觉…好像又变年轻了
And I'm starting...
to feel young again.

1382
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,183
看看东西做的如何了
Look how nice this is.

1383
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:36,641
这肉快好了
I think this meat
is almost ready.

1384
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:40,345
- 看我带了什么
- 迷迭香？
- And look what I brought.
- Rosemary?

1385
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:42,481
- 美味
- 这是干嘛的？
- Delicious.
- What is it for?

1386
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,637
- 放排骨里
- 没门
- The côte de boeuf.
- No way.

1387
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:47,251
- 为什么不？
- 牛脊肉里不能加迷迭香！
- Why not?
- No rosemary on rib roast!

1388
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,523
你在开玩笑吗？
You kidding?

1389
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:50,931
我不会让你毁掉这道烤肉的！
I will not let you
ruin this roast!

1390
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:54,167
这有果汁和黄油，这些才是应该加的
There's juice and butter.
That's what counts.

1391
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:57,081
- 记住我们还在直播
- 直播我也得说
- Remember we're live.
- I'll say it live.

1392
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:58,897
- 把肉给我
- 绝不！
- Give me the meat.
- No!

1393
01:20:59,532 --> 01:21:00,795
迷迭香会掩盖掉味道的
It'll mask the flavor.

1394
01:21:01,598 --> 01:21:03,048
过来
Come here.

1395
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:04,972
烤排骨里面不能加迷迭香
No rosemary on
côte de boeuf.

1396
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,035
回来！你要去哪？
Come back!
Where are you going?

1397
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,215
我宁愿倒掉它也不放迷迭香
I'd rather drown it
than use rosemary.

1398
01:21:10,426 --> 01:21:12,041
只不过一点迷迭香！
Just a little rosemary!

1399
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:15,590
那怎么不再加点百里香？还有香葱！
Why not some thyme too?
And chives!

1400
01:21:16,862 --> 01:21:18,104
切掉
Cut.

1401
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:17,680
呱，呱…
Quack, quack...

1402
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:22,965
呱，呱…
Quack, quack...

1403
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,480
切，结束
<i>Cut. End-slate.</i>

1404
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
