1
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,504
THE CHEF

2
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,961
<i>Sole meunière, table 2!</i>

3
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,170
<i>Blanquette for 11.</i>

4
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,027
<i>Steak tartare.</i>

5
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,679
<i>Entrecôte, château Briand,
and fries.</i>

6
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:28,318
Forget the decorations.
The guy has 20 minutes to eat.

7
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,498
- That's not enough.
- Faugères for table 8.

8
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,658
- Aren't they having veal?
- Yes.

9
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,452
You ordered Faugères?
- Yes.

10
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,866
- Can I ask why?
- The waiter suggested it.

11
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,083
Damned boozehound.

12
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,720
With a veal blanquette,
try a dry white.

13
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,776
- For example, a 2003 Muscadet.
- We prefer red.

14
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,633
You prefer red?
No problem.

15
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:03,376
In that case, steak and
fries would be a safer bet.

16
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,801
My blanquette!

17
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,362
Can't I have one more chance?

18
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,571
Just a week.
- No.

19
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,277
Don't you realize? You
attacked 6 people over meat!

20
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,426
- They wanted their lamb medium!
- So what?

21
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,389
You almost hit a guy
who put mustard on his sole.

22
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,168
What does Bocuse say?

23
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,046
Bocuse can blow it
out his ass.

24
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,039
We don't do fine dining.

25
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,265
First Basque chiken at 4,
first soufflé at 5.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,193
They say I'm
the Mozart of the range.

27
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:39,125
Mozart of the what?

28
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,365
The kitchen range...

29
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,666
I know all the big
chefs' recipes.

30
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,876
I'm a culinary whiz.

31
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,301
Hello, gentlemen.

32
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,819
- You're new here.
- Yes.

33
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,830
- Steak and fries.
- Meat stew and fries.

34
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,865
I'll have the herring
and some fries.

35
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,691
Let's get serious. Men, please.

36
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:04,697
Today I suggest
a butternut squash mousse

37
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:09,929
with chestnut dominoes and
tomato ravioli on oak leaf lettuce.

38
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,651
Come with fries?

39
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,689
It comes with beets
à la paprika,

40
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,792
watercress soup
with carrot foam

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,916
and a dash of
Azincourt vinegar.

42
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,423
Who's this faggot?

43
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,731
Beat it, you and
your paprika crap!

44
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:46,216
So Jacky?
Finally buying your chef's outfit?

45
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:49,373
Soon.
Soon, you'll see.

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,606
Sprinkle the beef
with breadcrumbs

47
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,523
and melted butter.

48
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,325
Cloves.
Orange rinds.

49
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,400
How did work go?

50
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:04,747
No, Jacky!
Fired 4 times in 4 weeks!

51
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,839
Soon there will be
three of us!

52
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,577
They don't understand me, at all.

53
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:14,082
- See our overdraft?
- Yeah, I know.

54
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,502
- What is it?
- I'm fine...

55
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,680
You okay, baby?

56
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,703
Are you sure?

57
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:25,475
You have to stop working.

58
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,535
And I'll find a way
to get a job.

59
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,386
- Any job. So you can relax.
- Any job?

60
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,700
First one I find.

61
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,034
And I won't get fired.

62
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:47,506
Hello, chef...

63
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,665
It's nice to leave
the ovens.

64
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,160
- Is all well?
- Delicious.

65
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,654
- How was the sole?
- Perfect.

66
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,946
Do you like my
onions confit?

67
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:13,144
- Fit to be devoured.
- Allow me.

68
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,180
The perfect mouthful.

69
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:24,094
I'll remember that.

70
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,890
How do I eat?

71
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,009
You stab it with a fork...

72
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,288
Chef!

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,395
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

74
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,976
You're legally bound
to show Mr. Matter the menu.

75
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:38,878
I have no time.

76
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,377
He'll explain
about the other restaurants.

77
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,459
Later, Marion.

78
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,319
It's no good.

79
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,528
I feel no emotion.

80
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,893
- Give me the vanilla.
- Yes, chef.

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,177
Taste it.

82
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,320
Very good, chef.

83
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:24,554
- Fantastic, chef.
- Nonsense.

84
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,631
Not for the Spring menu.

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,176
I'm getting nowhere.

86
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,971
Mr. Matter sent over a menu.

87
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,241
He wants you to use it.

88
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,300
He's starting to piss me off.
Follow me.

89
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,949
- Stop moping.
- I'm not.

90
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,079
You said you'd do anything.

91
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,244
I said it and I'm doing it.

92
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,101
- It's just for 6 months.
- It'll whiz by.

93
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,461
Have a good day.

94
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:02,140
- I think I'll like it here.
- Go on.

95
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:05,141
All the windows need
to be repainted.

96
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,340
524 all together.

97
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,414
Next...

98
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,077
the doors... 188.

99
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:13,988
Great.

100
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,782
- What are they eating?
- No idea. Who cares?

101
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,759
Your overalls.

102
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:24,240
- Your equipment... Nice and fast.
- Ok, thanks.

103
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,097
Hello, ma'am.

104
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,374
Jerusalem artichokes.

105
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,571
Consommé.

106
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,100
Squash gazpacho.

107
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:48,297
This is a menu
from the last century, Alexandre.

108
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:53,203
We need ingredients
to lower the prices

109
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:56,862
of our frozen food
and microwave meals.

110
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,174
How am I concerned?

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,412
You can help us
get government approval.

112
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,538
If Cargo Lagarde uses
these ingredients,

113
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,756
we'll get it.

114
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:11,518
I am to put that crap in my food
for your stockholders?

115
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,044
My chemists say it's risk-free.

116
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,615
Many big chefs work
with the industry.

117
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,146
- Think it over.
- I already have.

118
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,177
You see?
You're out of place here.

119
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,273
This is Cyril.

120
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,842
Two stars in London and Paris.

121
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,688
Come eat at my restaurant.

122
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:33,283
Phosphorescent radish mousse,
effervescent sirloin,

123
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,334
and free-range
chicken ice-cubes.

124
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,276
Amazing!

125
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,878
I'm giving Cargo Lagarde to Cyril.

126
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,980
You'll take the Mimosa Farmhouse,
in Orléans.

127
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:46,457
Look how pretty it is.

128
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:49,950
A perfect setting
for your hearty traditional cuisine.

129
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,787
Cargo Lagarde bears my name.

130
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,473
Your name is ours. We bought it.

131
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,360
You cost too much.
You're not profitable.

132
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,762
I can't be fired, Stanislas.
Reread my contract.

133
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,176
This meeting is over.

134
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:08,313
What?

135
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,150
It's how it is. It's the times.
No choice.

136
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:26,978
Someone knocked.

137
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,803
How are you doing the cod?

138
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,848
- What does he want?
- The cod!

139
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:35,106
- How are you doing it?
- We can't hear! What?

140
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,115
You're boiling it.

141
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,991
Use a double-boiler instead,
10 minutes tops.

142
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,858
It loses its flavor otherwise.

143
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,406
It becomes...

144
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,387
Open the window.

145
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,431
- How are you cooking it?
- Boiled in salted water.

146
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,695
Don't! It will be bland!

147
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:57,520
- What are you doing?
- Hold this.

148
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,951
We can do better.

149
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:02,449
So...

150
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,716
I'm thinking,
a concassé of sea prince...

151
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,977
with lemon mousse.

152
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,771
They hate change here.
They get nasty.

153
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,437
They don't even know
what they eat.

154
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,414
Yesterday
they mistook fish for chicken.

155
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,748
If you listen to me,

156
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,542
we'll reach the peak
of culinary creation.

157
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:23,845
That's not what we're after.

158
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,228
What did you put in our plates?

159
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,949
Concassé of sea prince
with a lemon mousse

160
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:41,322
on an asparagus raft
with rainbow polka-dot sauce.

161
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,519
I don't like codfish.

162
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,987
- Taste it first.
- But I don't like it!

163
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,493
At our age we know if we
like something or not!

164
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,612
- Only mashed potatoes!
- No yellow stuff for me.

165
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,067
The coffee is never hot enough!

166
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,708
Get lost!

167
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,215
Don't worry, Paint Boy.
It's normal.

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,452
I once put cheese in an omelet
and I got bit!

169
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,051
It's my fault. I see too big.

170
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,488
People don't care about quality.

171
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,057
Sorry, guys.

172
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,595
You know what?

173
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,058
Next time,

174
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:25,031
give them mashed aspirin
with Valium juice.

175
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,962
They'll love it.

176
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:29,420
I'll take the sage.

177
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,907
<i>Live in 5 minutes.
Just one leek.</i>

178
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,766
My mother adores you.
Can I have an autograph?

179
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,478
Live in 2 minutes.

180
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,887
I meant to say...
I'm leaving Cargo Lagarde.

181
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,543
What?

182
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,917
To run Miroir de Paris
in New York.

183
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,861
I haven't decided yet.

184
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,389
Stanislas Matter
already signed me on.

185
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,302
- I hope you'll forgive me.
- You can't do this!

186
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,292
I taught you what
a paupiette was!

187
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,676
Live in 1 minute.

188
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,052
I couldn't refuse
Miroir de Paris.

189
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:07,522
But not now!

190
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,994
Everyone is lying in wait
for my fucking Spring menu.

191
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:13,539
You remain in my
heart and head.

192
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,405
Screw your heart
and your head!

193
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,164
Hear me?

194
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,515
Sorry but... I'm leaving too.

195
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,182
Ten seconds.

196
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,904
He named me to Coq de France
in Dubai.

197
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,872
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all in on this?

198
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,199
Welcome to my show,

199
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,738
"Alexandre's Market".

200
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,320
<i>Here I am, along with...</i>

201
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,251
<i>my faithful assistants, Sergio</i>

202
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,554
<i>and Akio.</i>

203
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,817
- Did it start?
- Just now.

204
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,512
<i>Today,</i>

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,255
<i>I'll teach you
one of my favorite starters.</i>

206
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,245
<i>In the cold of winter,
when you're home...</i>

207
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,916
Crazy how I'm hooked
to this show.

208
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,858
Same here.

209
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:10,149
<i>To warm your heart, I suggest</i>

210
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,614
<i>a leek soup</i>

211
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,721
<i>with acacia honey.</i>

212
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,158
- You can cook leeks with honey?
- Sure!

213
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,570
- You knew?
- Who doesn't?

214
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,040
Quiet!

215
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,365
<i>Cut the leek into cubes.</i>

216
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,339
<i>Just the white part.</i>

217
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:28,308
<i>Yes, Akio. Like I taught you
all these years by my side.</i>

218
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,446
He's acting weird.

219
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,345
<i>Before the onions brown,
add the leeks.</i>

220
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,287
He never used onions.

221
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:36,890
It means...

222
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:38,647
he has worries.

223
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:41,001
Something with work
or a woman.

224
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:42,824
- Know him?
- By heart.

225
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:46,524
I used to steal his books
and offer them to myself.

226
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,882
Having fun?
How long can one window take?

227
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,047
- I forgot my brush.
- There's another wing.

228
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,749
Okay. I'll just be a sec.

229
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,868
- See you later.
- See you.

230
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,232
I was just... touching up.

231
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,873
You can't get away
for two weeks?

232
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,278
I need a second-in-command.

233
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,756
Dad, I got the date
for my thesis!

234
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,736
You know anyone
who may be available?

235
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,369
I already tried him.

236
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:17,959
So no one...

237
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:20,580
Honey, you're home!

238
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,803
I just spoke to
you in there.

239
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:25,114
I know you spoke
to me in there!

240
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:26,913
What did I say?

241
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,062
It was about something...

242
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,098
- Are you coming?
- Of course I am... Where?

243
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:33,958
My thesis defense.

244
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:35,745
What's it about?

245
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:39,015
Russian fantastic literature
and the 19th century novel.

246
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,418
We have more and more Russians
at the restaurant.

247
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:43,798
Great.

248
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,690
You going?

249
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,219
I'm working. It wasn't planned.
Are you upset?

250
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:52,415
I figured. Canceling is your thing.
No big deal.

251
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,981
Come on,
not another hamburger.

252
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,100
It's Miss Lagarde.

253
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,954
I'd like a double
cheese and a Coke.

254
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,137
Thanks. Goodbye.

255
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,497
Have a good night, Dad!

256
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,981
Jacky, we want food!

257
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,539
We want the same
thing as yesterday!

258
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:17,844
We want Jacky's food!

259
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,773
- I have trouble with your son.
- How so?

260
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,433
He wants me to use gelling agents,
chemical shit.

261
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:32,231
I see.
Taste this.

262
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,440
I'm in deep shit, Paul.

263
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,237
I have no inspiration.

264
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:39,837
Same thing every year.
You think you'll lose a star.

265
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,159
Just taste.

266
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,524
What is it?

267
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:57,652
Incredible.

268
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:00,522
That's the word.

269
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:04,491
My red mullet and pumpkin recipe
from 1996!

270
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,279
Exactly.

271
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,570
It's wild. It's all there.

272
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:10,903
The balance of vegetables,

273
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,539
the harmony of spices.
Everything!

274
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,767
Who made this?

275
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,296
See that painter there?

276
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,791
The painter?

277
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,992
Excuse me,
can we talk a bit?

278
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:37,940
Is it you who made my recipe
for mullet and pumpkin from '96?

279
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,663
No, '97.

280
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,692
In '96 it was St.Pierre
and potato mousseline.

281
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:46,964
- Are you sure?
- You bet!

282
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,510
For me, that recipe
was like Michelangelo's David.

283
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,511
Interesting analogy.

284
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:58,946
I need a second-in-command.

285
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,419
Would you work on a trial basis
at Cargo Lagarde?

286
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,114
But I'll get a contract?

287
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,999
- A trial. Then we'll see.
- How long?

288
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,655
Whatever the law says.
One month, two...

289
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,863
I'm sorry. I can't.

290
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:19,585
I have a 6-month contract here.
My wife is pregnant.

291
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,589
- She'll understand.
- No, she won't.

292
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,394
You can't say no
to Cargo Lagarde!

293
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,551
Are you a total idiot?

294
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,030
No, sir. I love my wife.
That's all.

295
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,175
You're all starting to
piss me off. Big time!

296
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,395
Mr. Lagarde, wait!

297
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,171
I accept your offer.

298
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,868
Fine... Tomorrow at
8 at the Cargo.

299
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,995
You're right.
I'll tell my wife the truth.

300
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:49,845
Of course...

301
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,322
she'll understand
that I left...

302
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,417
a paid job for an
unpaid internship.

303
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,156
- What's that?
- They're flowers.

304
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,892
- Why are you here?
- To pick you up.

305
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,574
I like knowing
you can count on me now.

306
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,581
- You got fired?
- Not at all.

307
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:15,423
Something serious.

308
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,552
Do you want them or not?

309
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:21,161
Of course I do. You carry them.
I'm a little pregnant.

310
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,641
Guess what happened.

311
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,101
I knew there was something.

312
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,658
Yeah, there was something.

313
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,122
Guess who congratulated me.

314
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,344
Who?

315
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,564
Alexandre...

316
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,462
The manager of the
old-age facility.

317
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:46,461
He says I paint fast.
He wants me to do the whole place.

318
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,536
Zeroing in on the kitchen?

319
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:54,598
You're crazy. The kitchen
is miles away!

320
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,130
Stop it!

321
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,710
Alexandre! Stop this!

322
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,509
Mr. Matter sent us!

323
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,488
Next time I'll throw
you in the meat locker!

324
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,337
- Morning, chef.
- You're late.

325
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,577
- It's 8:02.
- That's what I said. You're late!

326
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,478
Janine!

327
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,078
Embroider his initials.

328
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,589
- Of course.
- It's Jacky Bonnot.

329
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,215
Hold on.

330
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,528
Only normal.

331
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,842
"I wanted to say, chef,

332
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,588
I am aware of the chance
you're giving me."

333
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,087
"Indeed, as a mere child,

334
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,892
your recipes were like
beads in a necklace..."

335
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,113
See you in the kitchen.

336
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,879
Okay.
I'll be right there.

337
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,762
That's Marcel Bouchard...

338
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,445
- Here.
- Thanks.

339
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,630
This apron and I have
a long life ahead.

340
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,695
Start by not getting
fired today.

341
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,361
Everyone,
your attention please.

342
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,120
Taste this and tell
me what's in it.

343
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,310
- Blindfolded?
- This isn't a music hall.

344
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,123
So...

345
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,608
Roasted turbot.

346
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,492
With a spinach coulis.

347
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,777
The sauce is...
tomato and olive.

348
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:43,051
Daikon radish,
salted butter.

349
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,768
I'd have added a
pinch more salt.

350
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,448
Very good.

351
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,282
What does that smell like?

352
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,690
Confit of grilled beef.

353
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,554
Vintage Select Beef,
excellent choice.

354
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,338
Zucchini and potatoes...

355
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,068
Lady Christels,
excellent texture.

356
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,709
They stay firm
in boiling water.

357
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,690
A little grilled eggplant...

358
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,427
Over-grilled.

359
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,263
Way over-grilled, if I may.

360
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,310
He's right.
This eggplant is over-grilled.

361
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,001
Who made this?

362
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,148
I did.

363
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,484
I've told you.
Eggplants are touchy.

364
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,607
Don't hurt them.
Look them straight in the eye.

365
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,662
I looked it in the eye!

366
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,018
- Toss it.
- Yes, chef.

367
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,425
Obviously,
you'd never have done that.

368
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,867
No, chef.
I'd have heard the eggplant scream.

369
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,793
Jacky is the vegetable
whisperer.

370
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,250
And listener.
That's important.

371
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,562
What's this carrot saying?

372
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,923
Grate me.

373
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,748
It wants to be grated.

374
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,338
- Grate it.
- Yes, chef.

375
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,045
For the St. Pierre.

376
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:05,941
Jacky will watch you work today.
Tomorrow, he'll run both services.

377
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,409
- Get to work.
- Yes, chef!

378
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,698
So I'm hired, chef?

379
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:15,242
Wait until rush hour.
Many a man returns his apron.

380
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,833
- Not Jacky Bonnot.
- We'll see.

381
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,242
What's this?

382
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:24,535
Sweetbread, scallops, vanilla...

383
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,143
Forget that.
I do the creating.

384
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:29,292
I was thinking...

385
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,173
Got it.

386
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,865
I feel so good.

387
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,102
Touch... Our baby is relaxed too.

388
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,556
It's thanks to the new Jacky.

389
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,015
New Jacky....

390
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,463
Don't go overboard.

391
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,740
I meant to tell you...
I quit my job.

392
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,855
I've been with Alexandre Lagarde
for 3 days.

393
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:13,153
It's an internship,
so unpaid for the moment.

394
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:15,893
Sorry, I'm half asleep.

395
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,307
What did you say?

396
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,061
Goodnight, my new Jacky...

397
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,573
- How is it?
- Full, chef.

398
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,792
- Where are the langoustines?
- Coming, chef!

399
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,248
The chicken should
be ready by now!

400
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,224
I still need my piccatas!

401
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:47,919
I'll get them.

402
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,930
- Sorry.
- My fault.

403
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,912
- Careful with my piccatas!
- Make another piccata!

404
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,190
Do the langoustine for table 4.
I'll do the piccata.

405
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,469
It's not your job.
Check the chicken.

406
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:05,362
Look! It's not enough chicken.

407
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,116
You want Jerome to get yelled at?
Add more.

408
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,848
Clean this up, please.
Piccata, now.

409
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:12,950
Behind you!

410
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:18,138
Good work, Jacky.
Nice first week at the Cargo.

411
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,435
Thanks, chef.

412
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,169
Mr. Lagarde!
I love your lemon chicken!

413
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,530
But you should
use more lemon.

414
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,371
Add it yourself!

415
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,548
Sure.
I hadn't thought of that!

416
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,372
<i>Live in 5 minutes.</i>

417
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,111
Where are we going?

418
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,247
To the set.
To shoot my show.

419
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,599
No way!
I can't do a TV show.

420
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,558
What if my wife sees?

421
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:41,266
She works.
She won't be watching TV.

422
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:43,279
What if my in-laws watch?

423
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,420
Can you call me Brian
while shooting?

424
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,217
Welcome to my show,
"Alexandre's Market".

425
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:56,889
I'm happy to introduce you
to my new assistant.

426
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:00,934
This is...

427
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,695
- Brian.
- Brian.

428
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:07,297
Brian, this week we'll make
veal navarin with spring vegetables.

429
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:11,335
The navarin from your 1999 menu
at the Inn in Uzès?

430
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,016
- Exactly.
- Excellent.

431
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,291
- As you can see, Jacky...
- Brian.

432
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,950
Brian is the living memory
of French gastronomy.

433
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,062
- Why the sunglasses?
- So no one recognizes him.

434
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,688
Why go on TV in that case?

435
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,239
To be recognized but... incognito.

436
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:31,935
<i>We cut the veal flanks
into nice chunks.</i>

437
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,397
<i>In the meantime,
I, Brian, peel the carrots.</i>

438
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,881
- Why Brian?
- His American name.

439
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,128
<i>Cut these chives.</i>

440
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,605
What?
You're using chives?

441
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:46,020
Your recipe calls
for tarragon!

442
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,901
We're shooting live.
Jacky's a real clown.

443
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:52,591
Not Jacky. Brian.
I take your navarin very seriously.

444
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,458
So no chives.

445
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,226
Let's use...

446
00:26:58,343 --> 00:26:59,442
some thyme!

447
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,947
We won't use thyme!
Don't alter your masterpiece!

448
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,858
Is this a real fight?

449
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,906
- Thanks Brian. You can go.
- I want to taste the navarin.

450
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:14,066
- Better without chives or thyme.
- Shut up.

451
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,527
Ladies and gentlemen, bon appétit.
See you next week.

452
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,988
A bit of tarragon
would have helped.

453
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,551
Shut your trap.

454
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,886
I'm making a navarin tonight.

455
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,760
Thank you.

456
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:31,112
- Never again.
- I defended your recipe.

457
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,957
Alexandre, that was wonderful!

458
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,089
That was some routine, you two!

459
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,525
I reread your contract.

460
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,398
I know how to fire you
from Cargo Lagarde.

461
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,906
If you lose one star,

462
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:50,796
you're fired.

463
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:52,687
I'll never lose one.

464
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,700
I know all the owners
of the guides.

465
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:59,295
Two critics are going
to Cargo Lagarde soon.

466
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:02,676
Tough luck...
They don't like your cuisine.

467
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:06,436
I'm not sure you'll keep
your three stars.

468
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,496
I almost forgot.

469
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,260
If you lose Cargo,
you lose your apartment.

470
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,935
It's ours.
Bye, Alexandre.

471
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:18,174
Have fun you two!

472
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,865
- Chin up. It'll be fine.
- What are you doing?

473
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:29,484
- Comforting you.
- Comforting me?

474
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:30,938
Because...

475
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:34,594
- Get to work and keep quiet.
- Yes, chef.

476
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,583
Goodbye, chef.

477
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:48,649
Stanislas Matter came
to see all the suppliers.

478
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,388
If we sell to you,
he won't buy from us.

479
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:54,977
That bastard. What do I do now?

480
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,704
Don't worry.

481
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,632
I'll never forget your aid.
I'll help you.

482
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:02,264
Thanks, Marco. What a friend!

483
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,328
Julien!

484
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,657
This is Julien.
He'll be doing the shopping for us.

485
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:09,453
This is Marco.

486
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,423
Thibault, come here.

487
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:18,977
Add cinnamon and a lotus
leaf to the lamb sauce.

488
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,250
- We can't change his recipes.
- They're his creations.

489
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:24,786
He gave me carte blanche.

490
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:26,573
- But I can't!
- It'll be great.

491
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,166
Come here.

492
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,101
- Do it.
- He'll be furious!

493
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,214
- He'll fire him.
- Little prick.

494
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,085
Good idea. I'll do it.

495
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,610
I have two people at table 8.
Critics, I think.

496
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:47,543
Not eating, just tasting.

497
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,501
They ask questions.
They ordered the lamb.

498
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:52,276
And?

499
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:55,131
Your second-in-command
changed the recipe.

500
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,174
What?

501
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,179
You're going to
pay for this.

502
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,174
There they are.

503
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,262
How's everything?

504
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,222
Mr. Lagarde, it's delicious.

505
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,519
I tried your lamb
once before and....

506
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,131
And?

507
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:26,639
Brilliant idea to have added
cinnamon.

508
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,314
Cinnamon?

509
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:32,302
I thought the cinnamon might make
for an interesting twist...

510
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,168
There's another flavor too.

511
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:37,869
I can't put my finger on it.

512
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,609
- He won't say.
- No... he won't say.

513
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,659
- Lotus, right?
- Lotus, bravo.

514
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:48,894
I like some conflict
in the flavors.

515
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:50,601
It's crazy.

516
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,028
What people in Paris
say about you.

517
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,465
"He repeats himself."

518
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:56,201
"Just a businessman."

519
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,524
They're mean.
You're still the best.

520
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:01,105
- Tops!
- Thank you, thank you.

521
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:03,621
Alexandre... if I may...

522
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,519
I've heard that critics from Le Guide

523
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,758
are coming the day you introduce your
new menu.

524
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,478
April 12th, I think.

525
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:15,129
Le Guide?
Thanks for telling me.

526
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:18,088
Busseron and Marchal.
They hate classic cuisine.

527
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,540
If I may be so bold:
make them a molecular dish.

528
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:24,098
With liquid nitrogen.
Transparent.

529
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,910
- It's their thing.
- Molecular cuisine?

530
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:29,519
Not that.

531
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,980
What the hell is this?

532
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:37,362
Cinnamon? Lotus?
You're changing my recipes?

533
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,394
You served the same sauce
with filet mignon

534
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,344
at the Tokyo Four Seasons.
It had cinnamon!

535
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,962
But you can't compare lamb
and venison!

536
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,038
I was interpreting you.

537
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:51,274
I tied a new Alexandre dish
to an old Alexandre sauce.

538
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,386
Alexandre says to stop
making connections

539
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,747
between Alexandre and
Alexandre! Understand?

540
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,453
Excuse me,
but I know how Alexandre works.

541
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:06,127
- But I'm Alexandre!
- So? How does that matter?

542
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,768
I've followed Alexandre
since day one.

543
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,555
You want the truth?

544
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,212
Alexandre was better
before Charlotte left.

545
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,118
Charlotte?

546
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,625
My ex-wife?
Why drag her into this?

547
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:20,357
Since she left,
your sauces are stagnant.

548
00:32:20,882 --> 00:32:22,221
No one says it,

549
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,367
but...
you're in a sauce rut.

550
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,802
Leave Charlotte out
of my veal stock!

551
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:29,343
This is over.
I'm fed up.

552
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,498
- Get lost!
- What? You're firing me?

553
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,873
Yes!
End of apprenticeship.

554
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,345
Okay...

555
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,450
No problem.

556
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,011
Want inspiration
for sweetbread and scallops?

557
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,534
I know what Alexandre
would have done.

558
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:48,873
I do the creating here!

559
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,727
Goodbye, Mr. Lagarde.

560
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,524
- Keep scrubbing!
- Yes, chef!

561
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,516
Mr. Bonnot?

562
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:11,756
Chef asks how Alexandre
would do the sweetbread.

563
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,715
Deglazed, with elberberry vinegar.

564
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,047
Deglazed, elberberry.

565
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:19,594
He wants you to come.

566
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,292
Not too soon.

567
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,190
The elderberry vinegar now.

568
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,215
Why the dumb smile?

569
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,007
The first time
I've ever been rehired.

570
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,537
Go on.

571
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,793
- You're right, you idiot.
- You bet.

572
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:58,658
Okay...

573
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,688
We'll do the menu
together, but...

574
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:03,959
You can be
a real dipshit too!

575
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:07,340
I'm sorry, Alexandre...
I'm on the phone.

576
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:11,111
Chang, farfalle are done al dente.
Yours are overcooked!

577
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,124
<i>Okay. I didn't know.</i>

578
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:15,405
Start over.
Let it boil 9 minutes.

579
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,963
And remember,
stir, stir, stir...

580
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,251
- What's this?
- I'm helping at the old-age home.

581
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,214
So at lunch
you were working both jobs?

582
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,103
The residents love my recipes.
I couldn't just vanish.

583
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:30,971
I come in peace.
I want no trouble.

584
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:36,394
I'm just showing my restaurant
to Cyril and his decorator.

585
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:38,653
Leave my kitchen.

586
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,034
Very well.

587
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,963
This is Mr. Laveine, court bailiff.

588
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:48,370
He'll tell you I can visit
without danger, my restaurant

589
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,786
to have it redone.

590
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,005
If you lose a star.
Of course.

591
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:54,885
- This goes, Mr. Matter?
- All of it.

592
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,831
And that will be
polished ceramic.

593
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:00,401
Lose the wall, open it up.

594
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,421
The customers eat
here and there.

595
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:06,347
Here I want
a large table-screen.

596
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,920
Scallops?
Good idea.

597
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:11,231
Find the recipe in Elle?

598
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,197
It's about time
I see to the Cargo.

599
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,765
So, Cyril, come with me.

600
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,094
Come see the
winter garden.

601
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:24,477
We'll lose the doors.
We need space.

602
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,391
Too old-fashioned!

603
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,952
- Can you lose a star?
- It can happen.

604
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:32,119
Let's get back to work.

605
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,698
<i>Jacky!
I burnt the lemon sauce.</i>

606
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:37,032
Get another pan
and start over.

607
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,744
<i>Beatrice called here.
She couldn't reach you.</i>

608
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:43,220
<i>She has baby stuff
to show you.</i>

609
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:45,915
Oh yeah?
I'll call her back.

610
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,662
I'm looking for Jacky.

611
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,961
He quit here a while ago.

612
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,993
Really?

613
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:00,368
- Go ask in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

614
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,025
<i>First, let the soy beans
marinate in the lemon...</i>

615
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:07,868
I was told I'd
find Jacky here.

616
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,148
He quit.
What's it about?

617
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,654
- Where is he?
- Don't tell his wife!

618
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,689
On the screen.

619
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,849
- And you are...?
- His wife.

620
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,087
She's coming?
So we better watch out.

621
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,265
- I'm his wife.
- Oh... shit.

622
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,039
What did you tell Beatrice?

623
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,961
About your hookers.

624
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,068
Cut it out.

625
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,914
I said you had
10 minutes of errands to do.

626
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:34,058
Are you stupid?
How do I get back there now?

627
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:36,916
I have to call her
and find an excuse!

628
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,868
Jacky watch out!

629
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:40,889
Just a sec.

630
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:45,812
My wife has the
same ringtone.

631
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:48,344
- Hey, baby...
- Yeah?

632
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:49,970
- You okay?
- Yeah.

633
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:53,031
I'm just calling to say
don't bother coming by work.

634
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,157
<i>I won't make it.
I'm stuck in traffic.</i>

635
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,262
- Where?
- Not even that far... By Nation.

636
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:02,242
I'm near Nation too.
Where exactly?

637
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,456
You can't see me.
I'm on the left...

638
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,180
<i>stuck behind
some trucks.</i>

639
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,066
Hold on. Move!

640
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,994
I have to work too!
Let me through!

641
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,468
I'm sorry...
It's starting to move.

642
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:18,694
I'm at Boulevard Voltaire.
I hear an echo.

643
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,739
<i>Why do I see
you there?</i>

644
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:25,936
- Where are you?
- Jacky, your wife's here.

645
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,575
- Why do this?
- Do what? I did nothing.

646
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,997
Right.
You think I'm an idiot.

647
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,576
- I'm sick of this. It's over.
- Beatrice, wait!

648
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,849
Listen!
Chang, do something!

649
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,251
- He didn't go to see hookers!
- Not that!

650
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,736
<i>Honey, listen to me.
You can't leave like this!</i>

651
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,278
<i>You're in deep shit.</i>

652
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,608
Your boy's a real champ.

653
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,783
With him it'll be
shooting stars.

654
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,737
They pass by.
They don't stay.

655
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:00,427
They just shoot on by.

656
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,581
So long, stars.

657
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,487
Answering machine again.

658
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,188
She's not home.

659
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:12,118
Stop calling.
It won't get her back.

660
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:15,636
That's not it. I lied to her.
She'll never forgive me.

661
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,448
- I know her.
- They're all the same.

662
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:22,670
They want to marry a great man
but at the first screw up...

663
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,505
they're gone.

664
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,079
You know what?

665
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:29,258
She mentioned marriage a lot

666
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:32,390
and each time like an idiot
I said "not now".

667
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:40,058
So?
What do you think?

668
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,114
- It's flat.
- Yeah.

669
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:47,143
Have you ever tasted
a Cheval Blanc?

670
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,727
Nope.

671
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,408
Cheval Blanc '61 .

672
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,626
Just wonderful.

673
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,811
He doesn't know everything,
Mr. Elderberry Vinegar.

674
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,407
Taste this.

675
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,831
Check out the color.

676
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,375
Smell that bouquet.

677
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,104
It brings tears to my eyes,
a Cheval Blanc.

678
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,228
Me too.

679
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,498
My eyes are welling up.

680
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,841
The critics come in 4 days.

681
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,864
I'm cooked.

682
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,978
Why do you say that?
It'll be another triumph.

683
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,760
They're disciples
of molecular cuisine.

684
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:32,738
- Molecular cuisine?
- Goodbye, 3rd star.

685
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:37,133
Ever tasted a Petrus?

686
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:39,074
Neither.

687
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:42,866
- And the Cheval Blanc?
- Later!

688
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,761
I've got it!

689
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:47,826
I know someone.

690
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:50,711
A Spanish specialist
in miocailulaire cuisine.

691
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,497
He's our man. The best.

692
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:54,457
Is he well-known?

693
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,626
I was told he's a genius.

694
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:59,308
I'll call him.
Juan Castella.

695
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,150
I still have his number.

696
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:04,610
Answering machine.

697
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,495
Hello, Juan.
This is Jacky Bonnot.

698
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:10,792
I'm working now
with Mr. Alexandre Lagarde.

699
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,243
I think we need your skills.

700
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:16,384
Call me back.
'As fastas as possiblo'.

701
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,325
Thank you very much.

702
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,849
Thank you for what
you're doing for me.

703
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,201
It's an honor.

704
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,584
If ever I keep the
three stars,

705
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,999
you'll be
second-in-command.

706
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,328
Really?

707
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,393
- I'd prefer...
- Shake.

708
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,230
..."right-hand man."

709
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:40,837
"First assistant"
isn't bad either.

710
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:42,765
Okay, first assistant.

711
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,335
Is "deputy chef" better?
It sounds...

712
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,011
- Will you shake?
- Sorry.

713
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:51,350
- Let's have some Armagnac.
- Sure!

714
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,055
She's in Nevers!

715
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,561
I'll go ask her
to marry me.

716
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,592
Beatrice went to her
parents house in Nevers.

717
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,688
I'm abandoning you.

718
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,430
I can't live without her.

719
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,197
I understand.

720
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,204
Let me drive you there.

721
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,297
So...

722
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:22,330
first, tell her
we're signing a contract.

723
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:23,875
I'll manage.

724
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:27,704
I go, I talk,
she falls into in my arms.

725
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,991
Just kidding.

726
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,405
I'll just pave the way.

727
00:41:36,612 --> 00:41:38,502
<i>Neat place, Nevers!</i>

728
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:41,071
<i>It's here...
Turn up ahead.</i>

729
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,470
If they're not home,
they're here.

730
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:48,619
Let's go.

731
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:50,721
This way.

732
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,651
That's her.

733
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:58,137
But she's beautiful!

734
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:00,204
Duh!

735
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,868
Follow me.

736
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:03,716
What?

737
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,999
I don't have a ring!

738
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:10,951
- We can't go empty-handed.
- What do I do?

739
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:15,963
I'll whip up something she likes.
She'll forgive me.

740
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,906
Get rid of this... Next...

741
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,104
Jacky, why are you here?

742
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:25,531
Hello, Carole.

743
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:29,366
It's a surprise for Beatrice.
Please don't say a word.

744
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,482
You're at home here.

745
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,620
This is Alexandre Lagarde.

746
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:36,239
Alexandre, Carole, the owner.

747
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,781
Mr. Lagarde... it's an honor.

748
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,129
The honor is mine.

749
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,192
What a coincidence.
My cook leaves next month.

750
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,828
If you want,
you can take me on a trial basis.

751
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:50,315
You're too pricey for me.

752
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,120
Didn't we come
for Beatrice?

753
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:57,381
Yes... Beatrice, yes...

754
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,045
Sorry to intrude.

755
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:07,274
Let me introduce myself....

756
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:09,338
You're Alexandre Lagarde.

757
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,146
That's right.
That's me.

758
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,202
Beatrice, listen,

759
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,873
I'm here to say
it's all my fault...

760
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,903
I brought about
this situation.

761
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:22,397
Thanks for coming.
But I know it's not you.

762
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,471
Tell Jacky I won't see him.

763
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,297
Don't say that.
He has to tell you something.

764
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:29,094
I won't listen!

765
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,011
I have to tell you
that if all goes well,

766
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,888
he'll work full-time
at Cargo Lagarde.

767
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,405
He wants to hire Jacky!

768
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,289
A future father mustn't lie.

769
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:41,192
He's irresponsible.

770
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,101
- That's true.
- And unbearable!

771
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,546
True. I even fired him.

772
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:49,625
Weren't you supposed
to defend me?

773
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:51,822
Why are you here?

774
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,453
Hello, Armand...
Hello, Mathilde.

775
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,586
Honey, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

776
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:58,957
Look what I made.

777
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,288
Your favorite.
Caramel mille-feuille,

778
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,394
tiny strawberries,
redcurrants,

779
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:06,599
tiny pistachios...
- I don't want it.

780
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,469
You do! Look!

781
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:11,634
I made you a vanilla sugar heart.
Know why?

782
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,747
I love you.

783
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,936
Vanilla sugar won't work!

784
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,100
Let me make of the most
of your parents presence

785
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,720
to ask you solemnly

786
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,176
if you'll marry me.

787
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,624
Not like this!
Not now!

788
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,142
- Why not?
- You lied to me!

789
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,441
Okay, I lied to you. No big deal.

790
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:37,617
I never lied before.

791
00:44:38,162 --> 00:44:39,991
Once.
But that didn't count.

792
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,138
We weren't
really together.

793
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,381
I don't think it's
time to propose.

794
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,492
- We should be going.
- Sure, let's go.

795
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,871
I know it's not
the right time...

796
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:04,089
How do I stop candied fruit
from sinking into the batter?

797
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,342
Add the fruit to whipped batter
and keep on beating.

798
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:11,520
Thank you, Mr. Lagarde.

799
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:12,971
There's another school.

800
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,979
Put the batter in the fridge
and the next day,

801
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:18,557
just add the
candied fruit...

802
00:45:21,697 --> 00:45:23,925
- So did it work?
- Goodnight, Carole.

803
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,832
It's all fine.
She loves him.

804
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:29,586
- Your name is Carole?
- That's right.

805
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,712
- I'm Alexandre.
- I know.

806
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:34,330
- I may accept that offer.
- Of course.

807
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:36,889
See you soon.

808
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:43,473
She's pretty.

809
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,328
I know.

810
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:48,342
Not Beatrice. Carole.

811
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:50,562
I mean...
they're both pretty.

812
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,946
But Carole...

813
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,453
You have cream on you.

814
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,616
Not even enough praline.

815
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,497
Make yourself at home.

816
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,690
The Toque d'Or,
your first trophy.

817
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:30,989
And this is the...

818
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,733
Good night.
See you tomorrow.

819
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:38,650
Hey, baby.

820
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,901
It's me again.

821
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,706
I know I should
stop calling...

822
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,459
but I can't.

823
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:50,733
So... call me back.

824
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,213
- Still working?
- I have to be ready.

825
00:46:58,113 --> 00:47:00,813
This time I'm going
to lose a star.

826
00:47:01,143 --> 00:47:02,489
2, 3, same thing.

827
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,763
But come for my thesis.

828
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,887
I may lose a star and you blab on
about Russian books no one reads.

829
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,177
Go tell the rest
of the world,

830
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,310
no more scrambled
eggs with truffles.

831
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:17,211
See how they cry.

832
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:19,973
- How can you be so selfish?
- You taught me.

833
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:23,610
I was never around.
But I made lots of people happy.

834
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:25,580
Yeah, other people.

835
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:28,201
It's always about
your restaurants.

836
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:31,075
I'll let you work.

837
00:47:33,165 --> 00:47:34,561
I don't care.

838
00:47:45,218 --> 00:47:47,490
Besides working
at the Home,

839
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,438
I don't see how
they're qualified.

840
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:55,277
Chang did make-up at Crazy Horse.
Moussa drove trucks.

841
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,572
And Titi used to lay tiles.

842
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,822
What should I
do with them?

843
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,838
We need a crew here.

844
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:05,406
And guinea pigs to try
the first samples.

845
00:48:05,923 --> 00:48:07,309
Got health coverage?

846
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,854
That's him.
I'll go answer.

847
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,480
Alexandre,
this is Juan Castella,

848
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:17,414
world-famous
specialist...

849
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,614
- Can I say "world-famous"?
- You can.

850
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,069
...in molecular cuisine.

851
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,872
Good day,

852
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:26,759
Señor Alejandro Lagarde.
I am very honored.

853
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,381
So am I.

854
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,791
First of all,

855
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,657
I will taste your "cousin-e".

856
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:37,060
My cousin?

857
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:50,843
What is it?

858
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:54,048
Beef with seaweed
a surf and turf.

859
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,785
Straight to problem,
Señor Lagarde.

860
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:00,416
Let's get to work.

861
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,045
Pluck them.

862
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,815
Where did you get them?

863
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,578
Wild ducks.
From woods near Paris.

864
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,489
Woods near Paris?

865
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:12,618
Pluck them.
Now.

866
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,614
More duck?

867
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,537
More, more.

868
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,692
Much more, much more.

869
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,922
I am happy.
Look.

870
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,705
Where are the ducks?

871
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,643
I undertook fragmentation
of duck

872
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:59,294
and reconstituted taste,
into little cube.

873
00:49:59,856 --> 00:50:01,107
I should serve this?

874
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,884
He's not finished.
Now he'll work on...

875
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,471
Artistic aspect.
The color.

876
00:50:07,116 --> 00:50:08,977
The sauces.
The crunchiness.

877
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,444
Moussa, Titi, Chang!

878
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,722
Come have a look.

879
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,444
Can you three...

880
00:50:18,006 --> 00:50:20,175
taste this?
- Duck with quince cracker.

881
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,443
- Where?
- There.

882
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:25,101
- The cheese cubes?
- Duck and quince cracker.

883
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,175
Quince and quacker?

884
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,948
You put the quacking
in the cube?

885
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,206
How did you do it?

886
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,527
It's time to taste it.

887
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,688
- Is that normal?
- I take notes.

888
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:53,126
Too much liquid nitrogen.
Reduce by 15 grams.

889
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,525
- Should we stop chewing?
- Not yet. Continue.

890
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,357
So?

891
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,001
It's like a powdered duck
that takes shape inside.

892
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,106
It tastes fishy.

893
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:10,328
It's true.
You made fish with duck!

894
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,606
Must be problem
with condenser.

895
00:51:13,128 --> 00:51:14,865
I have to go check.

896
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:20,681
Taste, Señor Lagarde.

897
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,444
The true essence of duck.

898
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:28,148
Not at all.
lt's... raspberry.

899
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,776
Continue...
Continue eating.

900
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,362
What the hell?

901
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:38,101
Don't worry, Señor Lagarde.
Normal chemical reaction.

902
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:40,412
What do you mean, normal?

903
00:51:40,895 --> 00:51:42,096
Enough bullshit!

904
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,121
So no more magic food?

905
00:51:44,592 --> 00:51:46,473
No, no more magic food!

906
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:48,721
You, very hypersensitive.

907
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:51,366
Me leave!

908
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,808
That's right.
Goodbye!

909
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,358
I've had enough.
No more ducks in cubes!

910
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:04,975
20 years of pressure
just to please three critics!

911
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,418
I'm calling it quits.

912
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:09,435
You promised me
a job contract.

913
00:52:09,991 --> 00:52:13,001
We have two days to invent a menu
that's still a mystery!

914
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,383
It's not possible!

915
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:19,172
And Cyril Boss?
He manages fine.

916
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,227
How does he do it?

917
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:23,690
Why don't we
go eat there?

918
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:25,879
We'll check it out...

919
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,745
we'll taste, understand, analyze...

920
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:31,282
- And we reinvent.
- Everyone knows me.

921
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,390
I call and say:
"Table for two for Lagarde"?

922
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,759
"For dinner?"
"No, for spying!"

923
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,359
Nonsense.

924
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,582
- There's no solution?
- I don't see one.

925
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,094
- Chef?
- What?

926
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:52,513
Chang...
He was a make-up artist.

927
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:54,677
And?

928
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,591
Mr. and Mrs. Nobushi.

929
00:53:05,025 --> 00:53:07,306
We're honored
to welcome the cultural attaché.

930
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,535
Tonight we have
our new menu.

931
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,384
This way...

932
00:53:17,772 --> 00:53:20,486
<i>The chef Cyril Boss
welcomes you.</i>

933
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,477
Imagine...

934
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,540
- They'll do this to Cargo Lagarde.
- Disaster.

935
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:31,117
Your table.
Enjoy your evening.

936
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:37,312
<i>The chef Cyril Boss
proposes his Symphonic Menu.</i>

937
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,723
Liquid nitrogen champagne.

938
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,637
What is this thing?

939
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:51,523
How does it taste?

940
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,155
Champagne with cigar juice.

941
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:58,049
Compression of fowl
with udon noodles?

942
00:53:58,561 --> 00:54:00,419
Phosphorescent radish mousse.

943
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:03,236
- Sweetbread spaghetti.
- Virtual calamari.

944
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,472
Do you eat it virtually too?

945
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,884
Please try some wine.
Essence of Pomerol.

946
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:13,802
Without wine.

947
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:15,643
No grapes,

948
00:54:16,442 --> 00:54:17,563
no alcohol.

949
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:19,545
What's in it then?

950
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,237
We can't say.

951
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,508
Very, very mysterious!

952
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,557
Mizuko likes to be silly.

953
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:29,684
I'll keep it on ice.

954
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:33,934
Who wants non-alcoholic wine?

955
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,604
It's woody.

956
00:54:39,729 --> 00:54:41,794
I taste the
idea of Pomerol.

957
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,114
- And redcurrant.
- And leather.

958
00:54:45,234 --> 00:54:46,756
I taste leather.

959
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:52,045
<i>Sheep milk cheese
with seasonal fruits.</i>

960
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:57,777
<i>Tuna belly
with tomato.</i>

961
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,103
<i>Caramelized leek
with lemon grass.</i>

962
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:04,296
What the...

963
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,268
<i>Beef and veal
in their garden.</i>

964
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,562
Sniff these
while biting into your beef.

965
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:18,089
Not practical.

966
00:55:18,758 --> 00:55:20,247
You have to take it.

967
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:22,127
Not practical either.

968
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:25,703
<i>Cyril Boss wishes
you bon appétit.</i>

969
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:27,943
I can't get it.

970
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,070
This is interesting.

971
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:35,164
It's bitter.

972
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,275
Sweetbreads.

973
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:43,731
Sweetbread spaghetti.

974
00:55:44,664 --> 00:55:46,329
We have to copy this.

975
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,770
Your Excellency...

976
00:55:52,484 --> 00:55:54,224
- Enjoying it?
- Wife like lots.

977
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:56,412
Yes... very much

978
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:58,290
Excuse me,
Excellency...

979
00:55:58,743 --> 00:56:00,243
You've eaten
here before!

980
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,123
First time.

981
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,074
I feel as if I've
seen you before.

982
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:05,933
First time.

983
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:08,389
We to come... very far.

984
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:11,316
Osaka, Kobe,
Tokyo, Kyoto, Hokkaido.

985
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,652
I'm sure I've
seen your face.

986
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,448
Are you fans of
gastronomic dining?

987
00:56:16,937 --> 00:56:22,352
We to love very much...
fine dining.

988
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:24,610
Where do you go?

989
00:56:25,155 --> 00:56:26,563
Ducasse.

990
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:29,753
Robuchon.
Gagnaire.

991
00:56:30,698 --> 00:56:33,716
Alexandre Lagarde.

992
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:35,976
He totally sucks!

993
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:37,785
You wrong.

994
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:40,643
We to eat very well
at Cargo Lagarde.

995
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:42,794
Come on...
Between us...

996
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,655
Lagarde still makes
beef stew.

997
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:50,053
What's more
- I'll tell you a secret -

998
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,160
he hired an
assistant,

999
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:55,615
a bum who used
to sell gyros.

1000
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:59,315
Shish kebab boy!
A total loser!

1001
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:01,536
You enough.
No respect.

1002
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:05,163
In Japan, Monsieur Lagarde
restaurant ichiban!

1003
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,487
- Great insult.
- Number one!

1004
00:57:08,193 --> 00:57:09,818
You, Cyril Boss...

1005
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,079
nothing at all!

1006
00:57:12,186 --> 00:57:13,984
The food critics
want to see you.

1007
00:57:14,956 --> 00:57:17,217
Okay. I'm coming.
I'll be right back.

1008
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:19,739
Probably for some
more compliments.

1009
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,963
We better go or
I'll clobber him.

1010
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,424
- In the face.
- Let's go.

1011
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:29,926
Wait. First, let's borrow
a few ingredients.

1012
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,907
Very nice digestive dance!

1013
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,028
- It went well.
- I'm loaded.

1014
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:12,562
Leaving?
No strawberry éclair in a test tube?

1015
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,974
- No, we go.
- Yes, sick.

1016
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:18,026
I'll see you soon
at Cargo Lagarde.

1017
00:58:18,488 --> 00:58:20,408
I'm the new chef there.

1018
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:24,489
If you mention Cargo
Lagarde again,

1019
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,294
know where I put
your test tubes?

1020
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:30,280
- No.
- Better you don't know.

1021
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,039
<i>The chef Cyril Boss
thanks you for coming.</i>

1022
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:37,482
Bring in the food.

1023
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:41,520
Explosion of beef
with ginger!

1024
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:43,699
Why are you screaming?

1025
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:45,887
Because it's classier.

1026
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,290
No one screams
in 3-star restaurants.

1027
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:50,500
How would I know?

1028
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:55,276
Bone marrow on toast,
vitrified in squid ink.

1029
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,032
Don't scream.

1030
00:58:57,793 --> 00:58:59,992
- But Titi told me to.
- Titi got it all wrong.

1031
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,564
So I don't scream either?

1032
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:11,047
- Tomato and cucumber in their froth.
- What?

1033
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:14,387
Tomato and cucumber
in their froth.

1034
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,097
Thank you.

1035
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,023
I said it softly.

1036
00:59:27,392 --> 00:59:29,025
So, chef?

1037
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:31,584
- It's not bad.
- Not bad?

1038
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:40,405
- I wake up in 4 hours.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

1039
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,118
It's the Spring Menu.
I have the critics tomorrow.

1040
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:45,365
Tomorrow.
You're not coming?

1041
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,512
Where?

1042
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:53,090
Behave yourselves!

1043
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:56,386
Send in the rest.

1044
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:06,562
- Thank you.
- Jacky's right.

1045
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:09,707
His method is better
than Lagarde's.

1046
01:00:10,229 --> 01:00:11,977
Fruit in every bite!

1047
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:15,626
Stop making that kid suffer.
He's such a good cook.

1048
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:17,832
He drove 200 kilometers

1049
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:20,278
to ask your hand
in marriage.

1050
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,730
Admire the elegance
of this cake.

1051
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:28,536
I was too tough on him?

1052
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:31,125
Honestly...

1053
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:33,314
What is it?

1054
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,100
Please take me
to the clinic.

1055
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:38,289
Right away, honey.

1056
01:00:38,821 --> 01:00:40,928
I'll take a slice
for the ride.

1057
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:44,031
Why not two?

1058
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,363
I'm coming...

1059
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,618
Amandine?

1060
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:12,321
Quiet, my daughter
is sleeping!

1061
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:15,857
Don't scuff the walls!

1062
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:19,734
I'll get it.

1063
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:21,888
No, I'll help you...

1064
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:34,821
That's the last of it. I'll climb in.

1065
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:37,173
Hurry.
Don't be late.

1066
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:38,554
You're not coming?

1067
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,683
You're the one
who's right.

1068
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,055
Without love,
we're nothing.

1069
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:49,756
What do I do?

1070
01:02:51,758 --> 01:02:53,319
Why are you here?

1071
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:57,069
You can't take a test
on an empty stomach!

1072
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,510
I made you a very intense
hot chocolate.

1073
01:03:01,107 --> 01:03:03,109
Sit down. I'll serve you.

1074
01:03:07,147 --> 01:03:10,290
Remember?
We called it "brioche à l'Amandine".

1075
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,665
You'd make me one
for every exam.

1076
01:03:13,116 --> 01:03:15,521
Back then I cooked
for pleasure.

1077
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,985
Then I became the guy
with all the 3-star restaurants.

1078
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,571
I forgot what I loved most.

1079
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:24,037
You and... cooking.

1080
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,252
Where are they?

1081
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:32,213
I must see you tell the jury
Balzac stole from Cossaks

1082
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:33,595
for "The Magic Skin".

1083
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,254
You read my thesis?

1084
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:37,823
- You read my thesis?
- Eat.

1085
01:03:38,123 --> 01:03:39,552
You read it?

1086
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,626
Three stars.

1087
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,961
What's wrong?
Why is nothing ready?

1088
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:57,859
Marco stopped selling to us.

1089
01:03:58,394 --> 01:04:00,233
It was too late.
Just wilted vegetables.

1090
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,696
The kind...
you can't whisper to.

1091
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:05,432
What?

1092
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:08,885
I'm looking for Alexandre.

1093
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,454
He's not here.
He'll be here later.

1094
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:13,153
Will you tell him to call me?

1095
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:19,817
Would you like
to work with me?

1096
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:23,680
No thank you.
Alexandre trusts me, and I'd...

1097
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:27,863
You're too pure, Jacky.
Think about yourself.

1098
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:31,306
Alexandre insists on living
in a bygone era.

1099
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:33,544
I don't agree at all.

1100
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:37,100
He's still the best.
And I'll be second-in-command.

1101
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,481
If he keeps his three stars.

1102
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:42,891
But what will you do without him
and nothing to cook?

1103
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:45,741
Grilled cheese?

1104
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,651
You overestimate yourself.
You can only fail.

1105
01:04:49,226 --> 01:04:51,286
Maybe.
But I want to try.

1106
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:53,338
Try what?

1107
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,074
You think you're a chef
because you follow recipes?

1108
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,725
You're not!
You're an amateur!

1109
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:03,797
And this place is
for professionals.

1110
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:06,531
Have you ever
invented something?

1111
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,663
Eggs mimosa or tiramisu?

1112
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:12,171
Was that you?

1113
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,041
You're a copycat.

1114
01:05:14,513 --> 01:05:16,170
Just a guy who
sings karaoke.

1115
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:19,241
That's all.

1116
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:21,359
So go home...

1117
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:23,938
Mr. Bonnot.

1118
01:05:27,262 --> 01:05:28,637
Okay...

1119
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:30,806
What do we do?

1120
01:05:31,277 --> 01:05:32,633
Nothing.

1121
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:35,215
No vegetables, no ideas,
no Alexandre.

1122
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:37,965
- We're here.
- That's nice, but so what?

1123
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,917
Stanislas is right.

1124
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:42,691
I just sing karaoke.
I should have stayed a painter.

1125
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,046
Beatrice would
never have left.

1126
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,532
- I'll go find her.
- What?

1127
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:49,370
Is that all?

1128
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:51,633
We left our jobs for you
and you bail.

1129
01:05:52,263 --> 01:05:55,729
- You'll put us on unemployment.
- You promised us.

1130
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,527
I'm sorry.

1131
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,527
That guy was right.
You're not professional.

1132
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:02,409
You cook for pleasure.

1133
01:06:02,851 --> 01:06:04,517
Professionals do
it for others.

1134
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,818
I wasn't laying
tiles for pleasure,

1135
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,460
but so people's
floors were even.

1136
01:06:10,714 --> 01:06:12,203
Phone call, sir.

1137
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:14,413
- Alexandre?
- No, a woman.

1138
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:17,192
Thank you.

1139
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,233
- It's me.
- Oh baby...

1140
01:06:23,198 --> 01:06:24,813
I'm happy to
hear from you.

1141
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:26,611
I'm so upset with myself.

1142
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:30,802
I lied and I shouldn't have.
And for nothing.

1143
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:32,813
- We got screwed.
- How so?

1144
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:34,862
Critics are here and
we have no food.

1145
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:38,503
I'm sure it'll be fine.
It's how you cook best.

1146
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:40,826
This time there's
really nothing.

1147
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,300
I'm calling it quits.
Now I know.

1148
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,194
Cooking is not for me.

1149
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:49,543
You and your excuses!
Go all the way for once.

1150
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,726
<i>How else can you
know your worth?</i>

1151
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,214
What you cook for
me is so amazing.

1152
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:56,863
Your saving grace.

1153
01:06:57,326 --> 01:06:59,999
Obviously for you
it was because I love you.

1154
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,900
Imagine you're
cooking for me.

1155
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:03,569
And your daughter.

1156
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:07,444
Really?

1157
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,223
I have a daughter?

1158
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,365
I'm coming.

1159
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,893
Finish what you
have to do first.

1160
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,939
Are you sure?

1161
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,158
Don't worry.
We're waiting.

1162
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:21,752
See you soon.

1163
01:07:26,385 --> 01:07:28,152
Is there
a supermarket nearby?

1164
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:31,562
Just a grocery
at the corner.

1165
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,198
Start getting ready.

1166
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:37,647
Turn on the stoves.

1167
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,719
Titi, boil water.
Moussa, Chang, let's go.

1168
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:42,713
Come with me too.

1169
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:44,655
You there, come along.

1170
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,958
Guys... I'm a daddy.

1171
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:49,210
I'm a daddy!

1172
01:08:06,742 --> 01:08:08,869
Some vegetables?
Nice tomatoes?

1173
01:08:09,158 --> 01:08:11,039
Give me everything.
I'll take it all.

1174
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,166
Vegetables, fruit,
onions, tomatoes, artichokes

1175
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:17,556
pineapples, pasta,
rice, flour, eggs, cheese.

1176
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:19,314
The whole store.

1177
01:08:19,331 --> 01:08:21,054
- Did God send you?
- He sure did!

1178
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:28,752
Don't let them scare you.

1179
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:31,118
The lemon juice is
for your voice.

1180
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:34,079
Okay, Dad.
It's my exam, not yours.

1181
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:36,459
Breakfast will give
you energy.

1182
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:39,094
- Don't overdo it.
- Am I?

1183
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,171
You're becoming
a helicopter dad.

1184
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:42,927
Wrong.

1185
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,136
Your sweater. It's cold.

1186
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,066
I'll park first.

1187
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,215
This is for broths
and stocks.

1188
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:03,840
- Chang, peel carrots.
- Right away.

1189
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:05,762
Moussa, chop onions.

1190
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:08,137
Titi, blanch the vegetables.

1191
01:09:08,748 --> 01:09:11,246
An hour and a half
to invent a new menu!

1192
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,806
An hour and a half.
It's impossible!

1193
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,638
But we'll give
it a try, okay?

1194
01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:21,779
We regret your not mentioning
Anastasila Vladimrovna.

1195
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:24,019
Thank you, but I felt

1196
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:27,287
it was irrelevant
in a chapter on Dostoyevsky.

1197
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,942
Gerard, I can't talk.
What?

1198
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,655
That bastard Marco said
he'd deliver the vegetables!

1199
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:38,698
I'm coming...
Excuse me.

1200
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,390
I'm sorry, madam, but...

1201
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,533
Sorry to disappoint.
I have to go.

1202
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,638
Trouble in the restaurant.
That was great work.

1203
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,949
I didn't get it all,
but I liked it.

1204
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,642
I'm very proud of you.

1205
01:09:54,464 --> 01:09:55,593
I'm sorry but...

1206
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:57,427
Isn't she great?
I'm off.

1207
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:59,263
- Papa?
- What, what?

1208
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:01,049
Thanks.

1209
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:03,094
For breakfast this morning?

1210
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:05,081
It was nice... See you later.

1211
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:12,717
Let's continue,
Miss Lagarde...

1212
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:21,118
Yeah, Alexandre had
a great reign,

1213
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,110
but he hasn't evolved.

1214
01:10:23,746 --> 01:10:25,465
His cuisine is
pre-historical.

1215
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,162
I'll keep quiet.

1216
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:31,446
I don't want
to influence you.

1217
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,121
The menu.

1218
01:10:34,992 --> 01:10:36,204
So?

1219
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,608
What has he
prepared for us?

1220
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,862
- Alexandre!
- Paul... you came.

1221
01:11:01,578 --> 01:11:03,913
I've never missed any
of your new menus.

1222
01:11:04,672 --> 01:11:07,046
Your painter did
the Spring menu.

1223
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,673
Where did he find
the vegetables?

1224
01:11:11,815 --> 01:11:13,273
The corner grocer.

1225
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,090
We're dead.

1226
01:11:18,432 --> 01:11:21,722
You must call Alexandre Lagarde.
It's incredible.

1227
01:11:22,163 --> 01:11:23,684
We want to
congratulate him.

1228
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,716
I don't remember him
capable of such subtlety

1229
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,761
allied with
such modernity.

1230
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,545
How does he put so
much emotion in this?

1231
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,473
It's like a woman hugged me,
threw me in a tub,

1232
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:37,824
sponged me down
with warm water, then...

1233
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:40,270
Not you?

1234
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:42,458
I expected as much
from Alexandre.

1235
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,852
I know that he's
constantly badmouthed

1236
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:47,710
but for me he's always
been the best.

1237
01:11:48,561 --> 01:11:49,765
Always.

1238
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:51,697
It's true.

1239
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:54,368
Alexandre, it's Stanislas.
Call me back.

1240
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:59,998
The critics want to see
Alexandre but I can't reach him.

1241
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:01,887
I'm going back out.

1242
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:03,945
Tell them he's
busy working.

1243
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,299
These recipes
are magnificent.

1244
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:08,764
Start the calamar, now!

1245
01:12:09,277 --> 01:12:11,149
Part traditional,
part molecular!

1246
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:13,234
I'm floored!

1247
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:15,702
How did he come
up with it?

1248
01:12:16,143 --> 01:12:17,192
I'm floored!

1249
01:12:17,714 --> 01:12:19,588
They'll invent a 4th
star for him!

1250
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:26,149
You were here?

1251
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,425
- You too, Mr. Matter?
- Can I taste?

1252
01:12:28,956 --> 01:12:32,268
- Dad, I didn't know you came.
- You didn't have to.

1253
01:12:32,903 --> 01:12:34,846
Everything from
the grocery?

1254
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,757
All I could get
my hands on.

1255
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:39,935
Did you hear?
I think you won!

1256
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,918
I am so, so happy
to see you.

1257
01:12:45,505 --> 01:12:47,674
Go on, they're waiting.
It'll be a triumph.

1258
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:51,437
There was some tension
between us recently,

1259
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:53,442
but all that's over now.

1260
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:57,734
I want you to stay
at Cargo Lagarde.

1261
01:12:58,452 --> 01:12:59,532
I insist.

1262
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:03,675
I'll announce you.

1263
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:08,217
I think the time has come.

1264
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,108
Hold on...

1265
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,582
What are you doing?

1266
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:15,635
Follow me.

1267
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:33,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
you enjoyed my Spring menu.

1268
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,563
And I thank you.

1269
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,483
But...

1270
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,298
I wasn't here earlier.

1271
01:13:40,864 --> 01:13:43,525
I watched my daughter
defend her thesis.

1272
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,205
She passed with honors.

1273
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:51,860
Thanks for her.

1274
01:13:52,352 --> 01:13:54,955
Hello to the critics from Le Guide,
here incognito.

1275
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:56,321
Not at all.

1276
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,188
Jacky, come here.
Come.

1277
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:04,996
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jacky Bonnot.

1278
01:14:06,752 --> 01:14:08,571
He created the Spring menu.

1279
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,758
Thanks, chef.

1280
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:22,363
He is the new chef
at Cargo Lagarde.

1281
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:24,508
Isn't he, Stanislas?

1282
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,749
Umm... yes.

1283
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:32,678
I was looking for a successor.
And I found him.

1284
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:36,173
This is why
I'm telling you...

1285
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:38,559
I'm done chasing stars.

1286
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:40,993
What will you do?

1287
01:14:41,454 --> 01:14:42,945
You'll know soon enough.

1288
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:45,998
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, chef.

1289
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:47,505
Good luck.

1290
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,293
Thank you all.

1291
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,933
Your mille-feuille was great.

1292
01:14:57,712 --> 01:14:59,521
Here, give this to Beatrice.

1293
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,359
It'll go over better
this time.

1294
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,933
Jacky Bonnot is
my secret weapon.

1295
01:15:14,328 --> 01:15:15,758
Gentlemen,

1296
01:15:16,231 --> 01:15:19,089
I said I had a surprise.
It's Jacky Bonnot!

1297
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:21,990
- Come here.
- Yeah, Dad.

1298
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:24,221
We skipped too many steps.

1299
01:15:24,684 --> 01:15:28,354
Before you take over the group,
learn to appreciate product quality.

1300
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,122
Fine.
What were you thinking?

1301
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:33,374
We'll find something.

1302
01:15:33,756 --> 01:15:35,370
- Mr. Matter?
- Yes, my friend?

1303
01:15:35,773 --> 01:15:37,665
- Can I have a job contract?
- Now?

1304
01:15:38,384 --> 01:15:40,402
I need a signed contract,
right away.

1305
01:15:41,058 --> 01:15:44,113
- Do what he wants!
- Sure. We'll sign you on.

1306
01:15:44,493 --> 01:15:46,662
- Right away.
- Write him a check too.

1307
01:15:47,197 --> 01:15:48,718
I'll write you a check.

1308
01:15:49,282 --> 01:15:51,030
- Okay?
- Fine with me!

1309
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:53,695
Great timing.
I just become a dad.

1310
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:55,595
Wonderful!

1311
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,336
I'm late. I have to go to Nevers
to see my baby.

1312
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:02,607
Give him your car too.

1313
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:05,815
Give him your car!

1314
01:16:06,718 --> 01:16:08,239
I'd like that.

1315
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,440
- Is there gas?
- Yeah.

1316
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:26,020
<i>Haute cuisine will
never be the same.</i>

1317
01:16:26,633 --> 01:16:29,613
<i>Alexandre Lagarde has
given up "the star system".</i>

1318
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,670
<i>His crew now works</i>

1319
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,662
<i>for a young chef,
a newcomer.</i>

1320
01:16:34,191 --> 01:16:35,832
<i>We tried in vain
to find out more.</i>

1321
01:16:36,377 --> 01:16:37,857
<i>Sir, can you tell us</i>

1322
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,264
<i>about this mysterious
new chef?</i>

1323
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:48,939
- Hello, Jackie.
- Hello, Antoine.

1324
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,595
- Buying your chef's outfit?
- Yes!

1325
01:16:53,546 --> 01:16:55,730
And twenty of those
for my crew.

1326
01:16:56,355 --> 01:16:58,667
They'll call.
I thought I'd tell you.

1327
01:17:00,518 --> 01:17:01,937
So long, Antoine!

1328
01:17:02,311 --> 01:17:06,174
<i>...Jacky Bonnot,
young culinary genius.</i>

1329
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:43,082
- You're the father?
- Yes, I am.

1330
01:17:43,707 --> 01:17:44,880
Congratulations.

1331
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:48,438
It's all about teamwork.
I owe it to my crew.

1332
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,937
You meant...?
No, for that I was all alone.

1333
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,687
When can I make her
boeuf bourguignon?

1334
01:17:58,201 --> 01:17:59,917
Two or three years.

1335
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:03,011
- Why so long?
- She's a baby.

1336
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:07,121
Have you been
here long?

1337
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,006
She's so beautiful.

1338
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:12,826
Did it all go well?

1339
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:18,308
A job contract.

1340
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:21,208
Excellent.

1341
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:24,256
- I have to tell you...
- I have to tell you too.

1342
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:27,560
So you'll be my wife?

1343
01:18:28,445 --> 01:18:31,501
Propose for real.
This is all so lame.

1344
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:33,607
Propose for real?

1345
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,300
Like...

1346
01:18:36,906 --> 01:18:38,706
Beatrice,

1347
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,794
my love,

1348
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:43,045
will you be my wife?

1349
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,968
I do!

1350
01:18:49,736 --> 01:18:51,021
Hold on.

1351
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,904
Just tell me.
When was the first lie?

1352
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,545
Why weren't we
technically together?

1353
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,531
Technically I can't
remember too well.

1354
01:19:07,102 --> 01:19:08,363
Hello, everyone.

1355
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:11,009
Welcome to our
new show,

1356
01:19:11,531 --> 01:19:13,136
which is now weekly

1357
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,312
- Alexandre's Cuisine...
- And Jacky's.

1358
01:19:15,768 --> 01:19:20,160
Jacky, give us food!

1359
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:31,053
<i>For our first show,
we're starting off with a classic.</i>

1360
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,773
Grilled côte de boeuf.

1361
01:19:34,412 --> 01:19:35,994
- Today is a big day.
- Sure is!

1362
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,153
Today, Le Guide came out

1363
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:41,606
and thanks to Jacky,
Cargo Lagarde kept its 3 stars.

1364
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,756
Thank you very much.

1365
01:19:48,454 --> 01:19:50,848
You kept your 3 stars
for fifteen years

1366
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,820
thanks to your
extraordinary skills.

1367
01:19:57,216 --> 01:19:59,550
You're no longer
at Cargo Lagarde.

1368
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,211
Why did you go and become
a cook in Nevers?

1369
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:05,389
Neat place, Nevers!

1370
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:09,215
Here we have
some neat images

1371
01:20:09,757 --> 01:20:11,937
of you cooking
in your new restaurant.

1372
01:20:14,183 --> 01:20:15,233
For you.

1373
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,125
Enjoy your lunch.
请慢用您的午餐

1374
01:20:20,127 --> 01:20:22,977
And here I am... with Carole.

1375
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:24,939
<i>She runs the place.</i>

1376
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,356
We decided to work
amid everyone.

1377
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:30,736
And I'm starting...
to feel young again.

1378
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,183
Look how nice this is.

1379
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:36,641
I think this meat
is almost ready.

1380
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:40,345
- And look what I brought.
- Rosemary?

1381
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:42,481
- Delicious.
- What is it for?

1382
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,637
- The côte de boeuf.
- No way.

1383
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:47,251
- Why not?
- No rosemary on rib roast!

1384
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,523
You kidding?

1385
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:50,931
I will not let you
ruin this roast!

1386
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:54,167
There's juice and butter.
That's what counts.

1387
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:57,081
- Remember we're live.
- I'll say it live.

1388
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:58,897
- Give me the meat.
- No!

1389
01:20:59,532 --> 01:21:00,795
It'll mask the flavor.

1390
01:21:01,598 --> 01:21:03,048
Come here.

1391
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:04,972
No rosemary on
côte de boeuf.

1392
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,035
Come back!
Where are you going?

1393
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,215
I'd rather drown it
than use rosemary.

1394
01:21:10,426 --> 01:21:12,041
Just a little rosemary!

1395
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:15,590
Why not some thyme too?
And chives!

1396
01:21:16,862 --> 01:21:18,104
Cut.

1397
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:17,680
Quack, quack...

1398
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:22,965
Quack, quack...

1399
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,480
<i>Cut. End-slate.</i>
