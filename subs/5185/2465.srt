1
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,026
是他们吗？
Is that them?

2
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:15,740
天啊，他们在这就地裁员么？
Jesus Christ. Are they going to do it right here?

3
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,292
你们之前没见过种事？
Have you guys ever been through this before?

4
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:27,286
没有。
- No.

5
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:30,005
最好忽视他们的存在，低头做你的事。
it's best to ignore it. Keep your head down...go back to work.

6
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:35,177
去吧。
Go on.

7
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:40,726
别偷看。
Don't watch!

8
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,039
蒂蒙西・欣？
Timothy Singh?

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,624
是我。
Yes.

10
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,836
我们得和你谈谈。
I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

11
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,229
埃里克・戴尔？
Eric Dale?

12
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:26,132
-什么？  -埃里克・戴尔？
- Excuse me?    - Eric Dale?

13
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,436
-呃，不是。 -什么？
-Er, no.   -Sorry?

14
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:29,869
我不是戴尔。
I'm not Eric Dale.

15
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,572
哦，对不起。
Oh. I'm so sorry.

16
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:35,660
他是我上司，在走廊那头办公。
He's my boss, he's down the hall.

17
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,387
谢了。
Thanks.

18
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:54,096
不好意思，戴尔先生？
Excuse me? Mr. Dale?

19
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:55,890
过来一下。
This way.

20
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,777
来了。
Okay.

21
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,404
我很抱歉…
I'm obviously sorry ...

22
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,616
我们今天来这里
that we are here today;

23
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:54,003
可现在是特殊时期，你一定也明白。
but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know.

24
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,347
听着，我负责风险管理部
Look, I run risk management...

25
00:04:56,757 --> 00:05:00,174
我不觉得这个部门是可以裁员的地方。
I don't really see, how that's a natural place to start cutting jobs.

26
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,578
请你明白这里没有私人恩怨。
We hope you understand that this is in no way personal.

27
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,723
这层楼的大部分人今天都要被炒
The majority of this floor is being let go today.

28
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,427
我们要向你讲清楚
Ms. Bratberg is now going to

29
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:11,898
公司提供赔偿的详细方案。
run through the details of what the firm is offering.

30
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:20,239
戴尔先生，公司赔偿你三个月工资
Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six months severance,at half your salary.

31
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,517
你可以保留现在手中的所有期货合同。

34
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,910
接受公司的方案，否则这些福利就被废除。
to either take the offer or it will be revoked.

35
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,345
明白吗？
Do you understand?

36
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,624
明白。
Yes.

37
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:41,731
不幸的是，由于你的工作有非常高的机密性
Unfortunately Mr. Dale, due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here

38
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,575
公司必须要做出相对谨慎的一些行动，
the firm has to take certain precautions 

39
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:48,538
也许有些会让你觉得有所冒犯。
for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature.

40
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:54,651
你已经为公司工作了19年，我希望，
I hope considering your...over 19 years of service to the firm,

41
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:57,237
你应该理解，公司的这些行为
you will understand that these measures are in no way..

42
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:02,193
绝非对你的工作或者人格有任何不满。
a reflection of the firm's feelings towards your performance or your character.

43
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,164
-我不明白。-她在向你道歉，
- I don't understand.  - She's apologizing...

44
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:10,285

45
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:13,004
你的公司邮箱，服务器许可
Your company email, access to the server,

46
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,900
还有大楼的通行证，手机数据及服务
access to the building, and your mobil data and phone service

47
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:19,378
在本会议结束后都会终止。
will all be severed as of this meeting.

48
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:23,336
这位先生会带你回到办公室，
And, This gentleman, will take you to your office. 

49
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:26,636
陪同你整理私人物品。
So, you can clear out your personal belongings.

50
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:32,351
那我手头的事情怎么办？
What about the.. what I'm currently working on?

51
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,506
有些事我正做到一半。-公司已经有了移交计划，
I'm in the middle of something...  - The firm has worked out 

52
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,198
也准备好了怎么继续下去
its transition plan.and is prepared to move forward,

53
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,451
但是还是要感谢你能考虑到这些。
But, we do we appreciate your concern.

54
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:45,456
我们知道这很难让人接受，这是我的名片
We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card.

55
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,705
如果在接下来的几周内，
Please contact me over the next few weeks, 

56
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,704
你对这一重大转变需要任何帮助，请联系我。

57
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,680
遗憾不能共事了。
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,172
-你没被炒？ -目前没有。
-Are you still alive? - Uh huh..For now.

59
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,538
恭喜。
Congratulations.

60
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:57,526
形势严峻哪。-我听说了。
It's a bloodbath.  - I heard.

61
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,996
听着，埃里克
Listen Eric?

62
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:03,732
要是我能帮你留住职位，我肯定会那么做。
If there was something I could have done, I'd have done it.

63
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:09,539
-我知道你会的。 -我肯定会。
-I know. -All right? -Yeah. I know. -Ok.

00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:14,944
-告诉我是谁要我走？-噢拜托
-Just tell me...Who was it? -...Come on.

65
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:18,773
-罗杰斯？ -我不会选边站，你懂的。
-Come on, Will. Rogers? - I'm not gonna side, you know me.

66
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:19,918
罗伯特森？
Robertson?

67
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,876
臭娘们。我就知道，我去年就该去找她的。
That cunt. I knew it. I never should have gone to her last year.

68
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:31,405
没人要你走，只是你运气不好。仅此而已。
Look it wasn't anyone. It was bad luck. And that's all it was.

69
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:36,694
好吧，祝好运。
Alright, Well...Good luck.

70
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:45,780
近前说话。我这里个破事儿干到一半，
Come here. I was just in the middle of a lot of shit right here 

71
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:47,264
最好有人来看一看。
that I think somebody need to take a look at.

72
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,250
埃里克 听着
Eric Listen...

73
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:54,212
他们说所有人都不许进来，不许碰这里的东西。
They are telling us that everybody needs to get out of here and just leave this.

74
00:08:54,596 --> 00:09:01,427
感谢你的关心，但是这工作不再是你的问题了。
And while we appreciate your concern, but it's not your problem anymore.

75
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,644
祝你好运。

76
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,685
埃里克，我们为你难过。
Eric, I am very sorry. - Yeah.

77
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,273
他们会炒了我们吗？
Did they say what was going to happen with us?

78
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,567
拜托，塞斯。
Jesus Seth. - What?

79
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,995
这里最近会一直这样糟乱
It's gonna get pretty ugly around here for a while..

80
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:57,398
但你们应该没事。
but you guys will be alright.

81
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,681
我们回头见，好吗？-好。

谢谢。

83
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:33,111
我想对你说声谢谢。
I just wanted to say thanks.

84
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,745
-没这个必要。-有的。
-That's not neccessary. - Well, it is.

85
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:39,902
从你这里，我学到了很多… -我懂得。
You were the person around here, that I.. - I know.

86
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,053
有个事情我做了一半，他们不让我继续干了。
Look,I was working on something But they wouldn't let me finish it.

87
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,997
你看看吧。
So, take a look at it.

88
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,042
小心点。
Be careful.

89
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:29,914
罗伯特森？莎拉・罗伯特森？
Robertson? Sarah Robertson? 

90
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,057
莎拉!
Sarah!

91
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,252
你把我手机停了？
You shut off my phone?

92
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,264
埃里克，我什么都没做。
Eric, I didn't do anything.

93
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:39,567
扯淡！
Fuck you!

94
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:05,787
人心惶惶啊。
It's fucking hedious.

95
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,830
总是要先变糟了才能变好。
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

96
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:14,538
-是么？ -总是如此。
-You think?  -Much.

97
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:16,854
有烟么？
You got any Nicorettes?

98
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,310
我没烟了。
I'm out of Nicorettes.

99
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,022
也就是说…
Which means, in about..

100
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,162
10分钟内我要抓狂了。
Ten minutes. I'm gonna kill someone.

101
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,933
你没事吧，山姆？
You alright Sam?

102
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,200
我的狗快死了。
My dog is dying.

103
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:40,374
真..遗憾
I'm sorry?

104
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,292
刚打电话给兽医，
Just got a phone to the vet,

105
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,795
她的肝上长了个肿瘤。
it's some fucking tumor on her liver.

106
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,375
为了让她活着我每天都得花一千美元。
I must've paid almost a thousand bucks a day already, just to keep her alive.

107
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,891
我不知道还该怎么办，威尔。
and I don't have a fucking clue what to do about it.

108
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,487
他们都…走了。
Well they're all gone.

109
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,357
那…
So?

110
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,770
我们还剩下多少人？
How many do we have left?

111
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,073
大概33个。
About, Thirty-three.

112
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:13,159
把他们都叫到外头来，我得说点什么。
Make sure everyone is out there, I gotta say something.

113
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,124
他们都准备好了，等着你呢。
Yeah, I know. They are ready. They're ready for you.

114
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:33,389
好了，掌声响起！
Alright, Let's hear it!

115
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,740
你们留下来是有原因的
You are all still here for a reason...

116
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:45,942
这层楼80%的人都离开了，不会再回来。
eighty percent of this floor was just sent home...forever.

117
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,873
我们刚花了一个小时和他们说再见。
We have spent the last hour saying our good-byes...

118
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,751
他们都是好人，他们都干得不错
they were good people and they were good at their jobs...

119
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:53,736
但你们做得更好。
but you all were better.

120
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,922
现在他们走了，这里不会有人去再想到他们。
Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again.

121
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,919
这是你们的机遇。
This is your opportunity.

122
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,017
这栋楼的所有楼层，从香港到伦敦的
On every floor of this building and in every office 

123
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:06,408
所有办公室，都在发生同样的事
from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening.

124
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,344
等这些都结束了
By the time we are done..

125
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,645
你距离你的上一级职位
3 of every seven guys;

126
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:15,227
会少掉七分之三的竞争对手。
who were standing between you and your boss's job...are gone.

127
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,796
这就是你们的机遇。
That is your opportunity.

128
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,154
我在这里工作了34年。
I've been at this place for thirty-four years.

129
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,623
告诉你们，这不会是你们最后一次经历这样的事。
I can tell you that this will not be the last time you're gonna go through this.

130
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,000
但你们都是幸存者。
But you are all survivors...

131
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,789
这也就是为什么这家公司在107年之后
And that is how this firm over 107 years,

132
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,000
还越来越壮大。
has continued to grow stronger.

133
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,919
所以保持高调，回去工作吧。掌声响起~
So, keep your heads high...and get back to work. Let's hear it.

134
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:35,737
大家都走了，你也走吧。
Everyone is going out man...you should come on.

135
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,982
我没事。
Oh, I'm cool. Thanks.

136
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,745
好吧，如果你改主意了，给我打电话。
Okay. Well, if you change your mind, jut give me a call.

137
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,830
我会的。
I Will.

138
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,032
来吧！
Come!

139
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:49,036
你们去哪儿？-大地酒吧。
Where are you guys going? - The Grand.

140
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,248
我干完了给你打电话。
I'll call you when I'm done.

141
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,803
嘿，我们留下来了，高兴点。
Hey, Be glad, you're still alive.

142
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,324
高兴呢。
I am.

143
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:36,324
喂？
Yeah, Hello.

144
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,743
我听不见。
I can't hear you.

145
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,296
你能出去说吗？你那太吵了。
Can you go outside, It's too loud.

146
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:46,401
等一下，我出去接。
Hold on a second, it's, well, just give me a second.

147
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:50,847
怎么了？
All right. What's up?

148
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,474
你们在哪儿？ -大地酒吧。
Where are you? - Lugo.

149
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:57,537
威尔在吗？-威尔・艾默生？
Are you with Will? - Yeah, Will Emerson?

150
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,181
他应该还在，怎么了？
Yeah, I think he's still here. Why?

151
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:03,277
好吧我要你和威尔一起回来。
I need you to get Will and I need you guys to come back up here.

152
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:04,820
呃，回哪儿？ -办公室。
Uh, Where? - To the office.

153
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,356
- 什么？ - 没开玩笑。
- What? - I'm serious.

154
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:10,367
你要我把咱们上司的上司
Wait a sec. You want me to get our boss's boss out of

155
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,164
在周四晚上10点钟从酒吧弄回公司？
a club and bring him back to the office...at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

156
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,370
咱们上司被解雇了，理论上说他是咱的直属上司，
Our boss just got axed,so technically he is our boss, 

157
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:18,326
所以是的，我的确要这么做。
and yes that's what I want you to do.

158
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:19,069
为啥？
Why?

159
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,673
听着哥们儿，相信我，好吗？我要你们现在回来。
Look man, Just trust me okay. I need you guys back here, now.

160
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,117
好吧，10分钟赶到。
Alright, we'll be there in ten.

161
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,341
我对你提起你背面有多美么
Have I ever told you how much I love your back?

162
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:52,147
真的。你有试过易装么？
Really. Do you have a little dress-and-match.. Is it?

163
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:56,951
你能像美妞一样跳舞.
You could dance around it like a fucking girl.

164
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:59,938
嘿，看看谁在开夜工哪。
Hey, look who it is, burning the candleat both ends.

165
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,332
为什么你不一起出去玩？
Why didn't you come out with us?

166
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,253
又没有其他的裁员计划，你不用拍我马屁。
There's no more cuts planned. You don't have to kiss my arse.

167
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,255
说真的,我其实不明白你们做的工作。
I frankly, don't even know, what it is you guys do.

168
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:11,551
威尔我很抱歉让你们回办公室。- 没关系。
Will, I am so sorry I had to bring you guys back..- That's alright.

169
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,755
-肿么了？ -看这个。
-What's going on? -Look at this.

170
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:16,632
埃里克走之前给我这个文件。
Eric gave me this file before he left.

171
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,236
他说他还没有完成全部的计算
And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out,

172
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:25,191
电梯门快关上前，他对我说的最后一句话是“小心点”。
And the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is be careful.

173
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,352
他说小心点？- 对，我有点好奇，所以就打开看了。
He said, Be careful?- Yeah, So..obviously..I'm little curious.

174
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,372
然后我就继续他的研究，发现这里的亏空…
I get into it a bit and I realize that the only thing missing..

175
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,590
大事不好了，威尔。
This is not good, Will.

176
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,093
什么大事不好了
So. What is this doing here?

177
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,171
用模式四，这样看着更明白。
Go to model four, it makes more sense.

178
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,874
这是什么？
What is this?

179
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,039
这基本上是我们帐下的所有东西。
This is basically everything that we have in our books.

180
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,021
任意特定时间的账目。埃里克试图演示
At any given time. But what Eric was trying to do

181
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,269
这些数据在标准预计亏损模型以外的波动情况，
is to work this numbers for levers of volatility 

182
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,278
这种情况下需要以不同杠杆值计算。
that fall outside of our standard VAR model.

183
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,354
什么杠杆？
What are those levers?

184
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,599
这…有点复杂… -那就简化！
Well it's a fairly complicated... - Simplify.

185
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,118
这些杠杆基本是由历史数据确定
The volatility levers are set using..historic patterns basically,

186
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,257
然后再按粗略的10%-15%的分级设置。
and then stretching those patterns out on a 10-15%... roughly.

187
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:07,494
好吧，然后呢？- 然后我们开始测试那些证券的走势。
Alright, So? - So, We are starting to test those historic patterns.

188
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,038
什么时候的？
When?

189
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,481
今天
Today?

190
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,284
周一
Monday...

191
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,921
还有上周五和周三。- 还有两周之前的周五。
Last friday and wednesday.. - Two Fridays ago.

192
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,823
好吧，我明白了。
Alright, I get it.

193
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:23,745
尼马，这个曲线方向反了吧，这…
Fuck me. Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...

194
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,383
亏大发了。-有多大？
It's huge.   - How huge?

195
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:31,888
损失好像比公司目前的市值还高…
The losses are greater than the current value of the company...

196
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,931
这是项目，光是项目上的损失，威尔。
Projected... Projected losses... Will.

197
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:36,352
只是我们这层的？- 没错。
This is just our floor?- Yes.

198
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:41,503
埃里克・戴尔在哪儿呢？
Where the fuck is Eric Dale?

199
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:43,499
不知道，我试过联系他，但是他关机了。
I don't know. Tried to call him, his phone's off.

200
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:44,147
什么意思？
What do you mean? 

201
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:47,270
他们把被裁的人的手机都停了。
They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.

202
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:50,216
没心没肺。你打的是他的私人电话？
Fucking ruthless. You tried his personal cell? 

203
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,585
是啊，他的手机，没开。
Yeah, I called the cellphone, it's not on!

204
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:55,212
给他家里打电话。- 在这个点儿？
Call his home. - At this hour?

205
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:59,918
对，你确定他是正确的吗？- 我看他对着呢。
Yeah... Do we even know if he's right? - Looks pretty fucking right to me.

206
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:04,307
戴尔夫人，我是威尔・艾默生。
Mrs. Dale. This is Will Emerson.

207
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,102
我很好，谢谢。能叫下埃里克吗？
I'm fine, thank you. May I speak with Eric?

208
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:12,971
找不到，我们试过了，他手机关机了。
No, we've tried that. His phone appears to be off.

209
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,893
你能让他给我打电话吗？
Listen, could you have him call me?

210
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:18,422
他一回来... 一进门就让他给我打。
The moment he comes in... the moment he walks through the door.

211
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:21,942
谢谢你，再见。
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

212
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,028
- 他丫的去哪儿了？- 他好像有三个孩子。 - 所以呢？
- Where the fuck is he? - Doesn't he have like three kids?  - So?

213
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:27,364
我不知道，你有三个孩子的话你会不回家吗？
I don't know, would you go home?

214
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,827
我知道他去哪儿了。
I know where he is.

215
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:35,171
你们俩去接他。
I need you two, to go and get him.

216
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,800
楼下会有车等你们，去吧。
There will be a car waiting for you downstairs. You need to go.

217
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,386
- 现在？- 没错，现在。
- Right now?- Yeah, Right now.

218
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:44,758
- 你要去干什么？- 我给山姆打电话。
- What are you going to do? - I'm gonna call, Sam.

219
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:49,723
完蛋了。
Fuck me.

220
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,539
- 喂？ - 我威尔。
- Yes? - It's Will.

221
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,125
现在是夜里11点。
It's 11 O'clock at night?

222
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:13,956
-我知道，本来不会这时候给你打电话… -怎么了?
-I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called... -What's the problem?

223
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,334
我想你该回趟公司。
I think you need to get back here.

224
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:22,048
现在可是夜里11点！
What? It's 11 O'clock at night!

225
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:23,812
我知道现在是几点！
I'm well aware of the fucking time! 

226
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:26,170
山姆，你得来看看这个。
Sam, I'm telling you..You need to see this.

227
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,814
看什么啊？
See what?

228
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:33,102
发邮件给我。
Email it to me.

229
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:36,898
我觉得那不是个好主意。
I don't think that would be a good idea.

230
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:38,901
好吧我来了。
I'm on my way.

231
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,699
看看这些人。
Look at these people.

232
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:54,292
在这瞎逛荡，根本不知道要发生什么了。
Wandering around, with absolutely no idea..what's about to happen.

233
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,574
对么？- 我试着不去那么想。
Right? - Well, I try not to let work get to me like that.

234
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,054
我就知道你没那脑子
I've noticed that about you.

235
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:10,976
行了别逗了，我们才23岁。- 我28了。
Look, we are twenty three years old... - I'm 28.

236
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:18,652
我去年赚了差不多25万美元。
I made nearly, a quarter of a million dollars last year...

237
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:24,123
卧勒个去，为了什么？就为了把数据码在电脑屏幕上
Fuck! for what...? Pushing some numbers around on a computer screen,

238
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,835
一帮高傲的傻逼
so a bunch of glorified crack addicts 

239
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:28,128
拿过这些数据，假装什么都懂
could take that information and pretend to understand it,

240
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,913
然后再拿这些数据去忽悠全世界的
and then make a bet against some other jock 

241
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:32,776
其它穷蛋。天知道，他们如果不被这个忽悠
half way around the world who if he..wasn't doing this,

242
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:35,218
可能会把钱放赛马场赌7号什么的。
he'd be putting number seven or you know?

243
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:38,048
最后总是有人赢也有人输。
And at the end of the day one guy win and the other guy loses.

244
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:43,686
你知道实际上比这个要复杂得多，对吧？
You do know it's a little more complicated than that? 

245
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:44,805
没错。
Yeah.

246
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,356
是威尔。要是问我们有没有找到，怎么说？
It's Will. He wants to know if we've found him? What do we say?

247
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:56,976
就说…还没找到他呢。
I would say...that we haven't found him, Yet.

248
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:27,810
埃里克・戴尔的数据…
Eric Dale...

249
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,572
在他由那个讨厌的保安看着离开大楼的时候…
Before he leaves the building, escorted by fucking security...

250
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,057
-这跟我没关系。-没说你有。
-I had nothing to do with that. -I know.

251
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,325
抱歉。继续说。
I'm sorry. Go on.

252
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:38,287
他离开之前把他的一个U盘给了皮特・沙利文
Before he leaves the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

253
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,245
谁是皮特・沙利文？
Who's Peter Sullivan, again? 

254
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,041
别管那么多了，戴尔的下属。
Don't matter, One of Eric's guys.

255
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,750
在电梯门关上之前
Before, the elevator doors are closing..

256
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,620
他说的最后一句话是
The last thing he says is...

257
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:46,997
“小心点”
'Be Careful'

258
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:52,510
“小心点”？- 没错。- 什么意思？
'Be Careful'? - Yeah. - Why?

259
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,055
看看这个。
Take a look.

260
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:00,544
哦天啊，你知道我看不懂这个。直接告诉我吧。
You know i can't read this fucking thing! Speak to me in English.

261
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,836
这个叫皮特・沙利文的小子
Basically, this kid, Peter Sullivan..

262
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:06,351
因为你的激励，顺便说一句，你讲的确实不错
He gets all inspired by you pep talk, Nice job! By the way..

263
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:08,528
下班之后他还埋头苦干，
He dealt straight in, after work.

264
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:12,282
现在他是板上钉钉了。- 找到了什么？
And I think he nailed it. - Nailed it?

265
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:14,703
他找到了埃里克在找的问题。
Yeah, I think he figured out what Eric was missing.

266
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:18,364
看上去不妙了，山姆。
...it‘s not good, Sam.

267
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,951
这些是…
These here are the...

268
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:24,324
股市上历史数据的指标限制，
historical volatility index limits, which of course, 

269
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:27,632
是我们系统风险分析的主要依据…
our entire trading model relies on pretty fucking heavily...

270
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:29,872
我们现在很大程度上都依赖这个指标。
And well, we are now so levered up.

271
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,840
但是当这些数据都超过预警之后，
But once it gets outside those limits

272
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:34,465
事情就变得很糟糕了。
it gets ugly in a hurry.

273
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:37,167
我们离预警限制有多近？
And how close to those limits have we gotten?

274
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,662
哦山姆，我们超过了预警…
Oh Sam, we're beyond close...

275
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:44,654
之前的两周里，我们已经冲破这些
We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks,

276
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:45,609
预警限制5、6次了
Now somehow, we've managed

277
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,021
现在暂时又回到了限制区域内… -暂时？
to stay on the upside  of it...for now. -For now?

278
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,836
你看，这是如果我们超到极值之外会发生的事。
Well look.. what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.

279
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,042
等一下，我该看什么？
Wait a minute. What am I looking at?

280
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,636
看这儿的数字。
You're looking at this figure here.

281
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,632
额…这个是？- 没错。
Wow...is that? - Yeah.

282
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:10,019
尽管这还不是我们有史来最糟糕的情况。
That wouldn't even be that bad a day for us...historically speaking.

283
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,637
这个数据对吗？
Is that figure right?

284
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,347
不知道，我不确定。
I don't know, I can't, for sure.

285
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:15,016
埃里克・戴尔呢？- 我们把他的手机停了。
Where is Eric Dale? - We shut his phone off.

286
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:18,846
然后我给他老婆打了电话，她说他不在家。
So, I called his wife. Who says,  he's not home.

287
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,105
他个小样蹲哪儿酒吧哭呢吧…
He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere.

288
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:22,691
发现这个事儿的小子呢？
Where's the kid who did this? 

289
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,227
我派他们出去找埃里克了。
I sent him out looking for Eric.

290
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,275
他知道自己在干什么吗？把他弄回来！
Do you think he knows what he's doing? Get him back.

291
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:47,460
这些妞一晚上挣多少钱？1500美元？
What do you think these girls make a night? 15 hundred?

292
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:59,848
2000美元？差不多。
2 grand? 2 grand. Fuck.

293
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:04,153
的确，能赚啊。
That's.. that's pretty great.

294
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,857
综合考虑经济效益的话。
I mean, you know, all considered.

295
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:21,873
我们在酒吧。没找到他。到处问了，没人看到他。
Will? Yep. no. We asked, no body sees him.

296
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:25,125
好吧，就回来。
Okay, Yeah.

297
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:43,605
好吧，那你说罗杰斯一年挣多少钱？
Alright, so come on,What you think Rogers makes in a year?

298
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:44,487
我不知道…
I have no idea

299
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,733
猜一个，消遣嘛。
Come on, play along.

300
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:50,771
75万？
Three quarters of a million?

301
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,332
别逗了。
Come on.

302
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,769
根本没沾边儿。
That was not even close.

303
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,288
要多得多。
Much more.

304
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,005
100万？
A million?

305
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,384
威尔・艾默生去年都挣了250万.
Will Emerson made two and half million last year.

306
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,462
-可恶！-这算啥！
-Fuck you! -Fuck me?

307
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,322
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

308
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,719
他告诉我的，我问他了。
He told me.  Well I asked him.

309
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:19,075
-靠谱儿吗？-差不多吧。
-Do you think that's true? -Yeah probably.

310
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:23,106
-真可恶… -为毛啊？
-That's fucked up. -Why, why's that fucked up?

311
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:28,903
-你觉得这正常吗？-正常…啥是正常？
-Does that seem right to you? -Right?

312
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:30,948
上帝啊。
Jesus.

313
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,068
所以你想想罗杰斯挣了多少？
So, what do you think that means Rogers puts away?

314
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,704
我不知道，塞斯。我就知道堵车真烦。
I have no idea, Seth. This traffic's a fucking nightmare.

315
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,516
伙计们？
Gentlemen?

316
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,468
罗杰斯先生。
Well, Mr. Rogers..

317
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,278
和我们一起来吧。
Come with us, please.

318
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,412
山姆，这是我说的塞斯・布雷格曼和皮特・沙利文。
Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.

319
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:23,296
我们这是去哪儿？
Will... Where are we going?

320
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,425
我们去看看别人对你所做的工作有什么意见。
Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.

321
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:05,341
山姆你有什么要给我们看的？
So Sam what do you have for us?

322
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:07,936
等会儿就来，这个点儿
Well... they'll be here in a minute. Finding someone 

323
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,187
找人在影印室干活还真是不容易。
in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.

324
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,712
好吧我们直接开始介绍。
Okay, let's go right into introduction. 

325
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:15,283
这是莎拉・罗伯特森，首席风险评估分析师。
This is Sarah Robertson who you know, chief risk assessment officer..

326
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:20,149
拉米什・沙，楼上办公室的，大卫公司的内部咨询师。
Ramesh Shah from upstairs and David Horn one of the firm's in house council.

327
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:22,742
很高兴见面，这是我的交易负责人，威尔・艾默生。
Nice to meet you all. This is my head of trading, Will Emerson.

328
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:27,746
皮特・沙利文和塞斯・布雷格曼，都是风险部的。
Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They work in our risk department.

329
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:28,816
埃里克・戴尔呢？
Where is Eric Dale?

330
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,526
他在今天被解雇了。
He was let go today.

331
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,330
那你们风险部还剩下谁？
Who's left in your risk department?

332
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,876
今天就只有皮特
As of today that would be Peter

333
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,921
和初级分析师塞斯。
and our junior analyst Seth.

334
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:47,637
威尔・艾默生？- 我的。发给大家吧。
Will Emerson? - Yes. Please just hand it out.

335
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,530
显然埃里克已经分析了一段时间了，
Apparently Eric had been working on this for some time 

336
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,705
但是没能完成。
but wasn't able to finish it,

337
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,749
今天早上他离开公司的时候
This morning, as he left the building;

338
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,342
他把这件事交给皮特让他看看。
He handed the program to Peter here, and asked him to take a look at it.

339
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,529
皮特就看了。
Peter did.

340
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:12,806
他把埃里克忽略的几件事做完了。
He put in a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing..

341
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,808
你们手里的就是结论。
and this is what came out.

342
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,587
皮特这是你做的？
Peter, Is this your work?

343
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:21,924
大部分是戴尔先生的工作……
Mostly Mr. Dale's...

344
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:23,392
但是这是你的手稿？
But is this your draft?

345
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,677
对。
Yes.

346
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:30,658
是在戴尔的计算基础上展开的，不过是我做的。
Again, expanded on original work of Eric's. But yes.

347
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,902
- 你是什么背景？- 我的背景？
- What is your background? - My background?

348
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:33,840
你的简历。
Your CV.

349
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:36,280
我在公司一直和埃里克一起工作，已经两年半了…
I've been with the firm for 2 and half years working with Eric that whole time...

350
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:38,618
但是我还有麻省理工的工程师
But I hold a doctorate in engineering, speciality 

351
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,994
和推动力学专业的博士学位。
in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.

352
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:43,163
推动力学专业是什么？
What's a specialty in propulsion, exactly?

353
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,968
我的论文是关于固定配比
My thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios 

354
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,996
现有数据对重力流失方面的研究。
effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.

355
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:55,257
- 所以你是个火箭科学家？- 曾经是。
-So, you are a rocket scientist?   - I was.

356
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:58,680
有意思，那你怎么又来了这？
Interesting. How did you end up here?

357
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:01,216
反正都是数字么，只是改变一下
Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing 

358
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:03,351
计算的方式… 而且坦白地说，
what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely;

359
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:06,598
这里的收入相对更吸引我。
the money here is, considerably more attractive.

360
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:15,198
现在几点了？
What time is it?

361
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,901
2：15。
It's 2:15.

362
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,369
我想你们两位还没
And I'm guessing, by the fact that you two 

363
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:25,476
提到有任何计算复核过？
haven't said anything that the math checks out?

364
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,288
我们需要时间分析下这个，
Look, we'd need some time to go over this,

365
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,598
但沙利文看上去很有把握。
but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know what he's doing. 

366
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,260
所以看来我们的确有麻烦了。
So, it would appear we have a problem.

367
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:37,721
- 几点了？ - 2：16。
- What time is it? - 2:16.

368
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:38,966
完蛋。
Fuck me.

369
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,303
糟糕。
Fuck me.

370
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:50,771
山姆…
Sam..

371
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:53,608
把这事儿从我们的帐目上摆平，
How long under normal operations, 

372
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,984
你的人一般需要多长时间？
would it take your people to clear that from our books?

373
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:00,614
什么？
What?

374
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,409
- 所有的？- 没错。
- All of it? - Yes.

375
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:06,294
我不知道，几周吧。
I don't know, weeks.

376
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:07,905
- 几周？- 没错，几周。
- Weeks? - Yeah, weeks.

377
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:13,044
但你很清楚我们的生意是要买和卖。
But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying.

378
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,879
没有任何一方都做不成。
Doesn't work for very long without both components.

379
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,740
如果我们现在停止买入一两天，
We suddenly stops buying for a day or two;

380
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,643
这可不是什么能藏得住的事，
that's not something you can ust doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out

381
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:23,268
一旦传出去… 很快
and when it does... this whole thing 

382
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:25,765
我们就玩儿完了。
comes to a end... and right quick.

383
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:27,894
- 我明白了。- 真的？
- I understand. - Do you?

384
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:33,399
真的。
Yes.

385
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:38,745
你们的楼层上还剩下多少交易员？
How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's?

386
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:39,956
我不知道，应该是…60个？ - 对，60个。
I don't know, what? Sixty? - sixty.

387
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:41,974
我们再仔细看看这个，
Jared as I looke at this more closely, 

388
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:45,246
毕竟这是用估计亏损风险数值算出来的。
it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.

389
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,067
就像我刚才说的，直说的话，
As I was saying.. just speaking completely off the record.

390
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:08,778
用不了多久就会有人发现我们的这些问题。
It's only a matter of time before someone else startsputting these in.

391
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,023
他们也会算出同样的结果。
and they come up with exactly the same results.

392
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,190
就是我们现在看的这份。
And look at exactly what we're looking at right now;

393
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:13,866
假设他们还没看过。
If they haven't already.

394
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:14,994
明白。
Understood.

395
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:19,232
萨拉，允许放在账面上的资产价值是多少？
And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets

396
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,041
如果必须放的话？
that might be left on the books, if they had to?

397
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,751
为什么还在账面上？
Why would they still be on the books?

398
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:24,856
因为显然没有人愿意去买这些傻玩意儿了。
Because suddenly nobody wants to fucking buy them. 

399
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:26,875
山姆！你丫安静会儿行吗？
Fuck you Sam! Will you give me a fucking break here?

400
00:36:27,258 --> 00:36:29,517
没有市场的话，这要花上几周甚至几个月
Without an active market, it'd take weeks or months 

401
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:31,386
的时间我才能算出精确的数字。
for me to come up with accurate value on them.

402
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,847
我要一块一块的算。
You'd have to go block by block.

403
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:35,430
杰拉德，这是个简单的问题好么，
Yeah. Look, Jared, it's a very simple business, 

404
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,767
我们讨论过这问题的。-喂！
right? We talked about this question once. -Sam! 

405
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,841
威尔，皮特，还有那谁，
Will, Peter, and what the fuck is his name? 

406
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:47,771
塞斯，你们先出去一下好吗？对了，
Seth, Could you please, give us for a few moments. And Peter?

407
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,907
- 还有人知道这个吗？- 除了我们没别人了。
- Has anyone else has seen this? - No one aside from us.

408
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,945
- 还有埃里克・戴尔？- 对。
- And Eric Dale? - Yes.

409
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:57,324
而且我们还不知道埃里克・戴尔在哪儿？
And can it really be possible that we don't know, where Eric Dale is?

410
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,794
我给他老婆打电话了，他还没回家…
I called his wife. He hasn't come home yet ...

411
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,753
而且我们还把他的手机停了。
and we turned off his phone today.

412
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,625
完胜了。我想知道他去哪儿了。
Perfect. Well, I'd like to know where he is.

413
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,564
我了个娘，那家伙是谁啊？
Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

414
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:23,852
- 山姆的上司。- 老成的好像有50岁了。
- He's Sam's boss. - He looks like he's fifteen years old.

415
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:27,247
- 他才40。 - 怎么会有这种事儿？
- He's Forty. - Yeah, How does that happen?

416
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,693
这种事儿一直都有。
Oh it happens all the time.

417
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:39,368
就我碰不上。他们都是魔鬼。
Except to me. He's a fucking killer.

418
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:43,665
他们在里面会谈些什么呢？
What are they talking about, in there?

419
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:50,132
不好喽。
It ain't pretty.

420
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:52,967
什么不好了？
What ain't pretty?

421
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:57,014
假如没人买我们的理财产品的后果…
If people suddenly stop buying what we're selling....

422
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:07,282
杰瑞，你不能想做什么就做什么。
Jared, you cannot be doing what you are thinking about doing?

423
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,950
我没什么别的选择。
Well, I don't see any other choice.

424
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:12,345
什么意思？你怎么没的选？
What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice.

425
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:15,465
我有吗？山姆你到底有没有看过这些数字？
Fuck me? Did you even looked at the numbers Sam?

426
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,167
当然，我看过。
Yes, but what do I know.

427
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,669
沙，如果我说错了纠正我一下。
Correct me, if i'm wrong, Mr.Shah.

428
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,879
但是这些资产和负债不再平衡
But..These number, they don't add up.

429
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,215
账面市值已经只是空壳了。
One and one, no longer makes Two.

430
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,126
如果可以的话，我还需要一些时间…
If I may, I'd like a little more time.

431
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,724
我们之前就谈过这个。 
We have talked about this. 

432
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:30,474
我们需要点时间才能给你结果。
We need a little time before to give you our conclusion.

433
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,467
好吧，我们45分钟之后见。
We meet again in 45 minutes.

434
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,429
山姆，你有原始数据吗？
Sam, do you have the file?

435
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,908
你要怎么办？
What are you going to do?

436
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,581
给他打电话？
Are you going to call him?

437
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:05,329
我已经打了。
I already have.

438
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:21,521
上帝啊。
Jesus.

439
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:28,821
哇，太漂亮了。
Wow. It's gorgeous.

440
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,965
掉下去也要很久。
It's a long way down.

441
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,334
是啊。
Yes, it is.

442
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,807
我靠，别这样。
Don't do that, C'mon.

443
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:01,130
知道么有人站在这个边缘要掉下去的时候
Did you know the fear most people experience when they 

444
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,384
害怕的不是他们会掉下去。
stand on the edge like this isn't the fear of falling.

445
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,486
而是怕他们会自己跳下去。
It's the fear that they might jump?

446
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:10,824
这太深奥了，你不能别这么压抑么…
Well, that's very deep and depressing, thank you.

447
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,335
有时候我心里是有点阴暗。
Yeah, well...I'm a little dark.. Sometimes.

448
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:15,964
下来吧，威尔，下来吧。
Come down, please. C'mon...Will?

449
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,084
好吧，去他的。
Yeah, Fuck it!

450
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,046
今天不见上帝了。
Not today.

451
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:32,772
看来他们要把这些破玩意儿全甩卖了。
So it looks like, they are gonna make us dump this shit.

452
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:33,615
什么？
What?

453
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:35,742
等着瞧吧。
You watch.

454
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:36,986
怎么甩？
How?

455
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:40,656
- 你会知道的。- 他们能怎么卖？
- You'll see! - How could they do that?

456
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:43,326
不可能完成的任务。但他们总会有办法的。
You can't...it's impossible. But they'll figure out a way.

457
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:47,163
我在这地方10年了，我见过的事情你们都…
I've been at this place for ten years and I've seen some things you wouldn't..

458
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:49,624
你们根本都不会相信。
you wouldn't believe...

459
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:52,279
这些都搞定的时候，他们可以毫发无损。
when all is said and done... they do not lose money. 

460
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,297
即使其他所有人都在赔钱，
They don't mind if everyone else does,

461
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,673
但他们不会。
but they don't loose.

462
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,435
威尔？
Will?

463
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:10,938
你去年真的挣了250万？
Did you really make two and half million last year?

464
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:12,482
嗯，对。
Yeah..sure.

465
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,737
你怎么花的这钱？
How did you spend it all?

466
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,614
很快就空了。
They expire quickly.

467
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,117
你知道的，口袋里是藏不住钱的。
You know, You'll learn and spend what's in your pocket.

468
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:23,168
250万美元很快就花完了？
Two and half millions goes quickly?

469
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,745
对，我们算算看。
Alright, let's see.

470
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:29,126
税收拿走了一半，只给我剩了125万。
The tax man takes half up front. So, you're left with one and a quarter.

471
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:32,004
房贷又花了30万。
My morgage takes another 300 grand.

472
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:35,048
我又给我爸妈15万让他们花。
I send 150 home for my parents, you know..to keep them going.

473
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,927
- 剩多少了？ - 80万。
- So, what's left? - Eight hundred.

474
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:40,888
15万买车，
I spend 150 on a car.

475
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:43,265
7万5花在饭店里，
About 75 in restaurants,

476
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:46,644
大概，5万买衣服，
Probably, 50 on clothes.

477
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:48,228
又存了40万以防万一。
And I put 400 away for a rainy day...

478
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:49,729
明智。
That's smart.

479
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:52,769
嗯，看起来金融风暴就要来了。
Yeah, as it turns out. It looks like the storm's coming.

480
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,529
还有12万5呢？
You still got 125.

481
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,322
我花了76，520美元找小姐
Yeah, I did spent 76,520 dollars on Hookers, 

482
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:04,905
和看脱衣舞上。但主要是找小姐。
booze and dancers. But mainly, hookers.

483
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,209
七万六千五？
76,5..?

484
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:10,054
一开始我也很震惊，但后来我意识到
Yeah, It was a little shock initially, but then 

485
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:13,381
我可以以娱乐开销的名义报销一大部分。
I realise that I could claim most of it off, as entertainment.

486
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,900
你多大了？
How old are you?

487
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,113
43。
43.

488
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:41,704
真是怪了。
This is bizzare.

489
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,543
这就像个梦。
It's like a...dream.

490
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:55,068
我也不知道，好像如梦初醒。
Oh, I don't know, seems like we actually may have just woken up.

491
00:42:57,138 --> 00:42:58,555
请进。
Come in.

492
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,058
怎么样？
How do we look?

493
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:03,560
我该走了。
I should go.

494
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:04,854
不，你留下来。
No, you should stay.

495
00:43:04,855 --> 00:43:06,398
怎样？
So?

496
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,066
没有错…
It's legit...

497
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:09,942
那孩子是对的。
the kid killed it.

498
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:12,595
这个公式没用了。
The formula is worthless.

499
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:14,657
什么意思？
What does that mean?

500
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,783
公式失效了。
It's broken.

501
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:17,951
全世界有8兆美元的钱
There are eight trillion dollars of paper

502
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:21,163
都指着这个公式呢。
around the world relying on that equation

503
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:23,457
但是我们错了。
We were wrong.

504
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:25,458
不，你的意思是… 你错了。
No, You mean..you were wrong.

505
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:26,252
别惹我说出来…
Don't get me started....

506
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,295
我们谈过的！
We discussed this!

507
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,337
我去会议室了。
I'm heading to the conference room.

508
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,881
不，你得听听。
No, I want you to hear this.

509
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:32,801
我不想听。
I don't want to hear this.

510
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:36,305
你觉得我凭什么在这干了这么多年？
How do you think I've stuck around this place so long?

511
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:46,065
我给图尔德打电话了。
I've called Tuld.

512
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:50,619
我们有备用方案吗？
Is there a contingency plan here?

513
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:52,406
备用方案？
A contingency plan?

514
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:55,492
- 对。- 没有，我们把所有钱都押在这里了。
- Yes. - No, We went all in on this one.

515
00:43:57,453 --> 00:44:00,311
那我们现在彻底暴露了，是么？
So, we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we?

516
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,877
对图尔德还是对市场？
To Tuld or the market?

517
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:08,590
都是。
To both.

518
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,740
他来了？
He's here?

519
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,033
图尔德的直升机到了。
Tuld's helicopter just landed.

520
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,677
我知道，一起来吧。
I know, come with us.

521
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:08,737
- 山姆呢？- 我不知道，我们几个都去？ -是的。
- Where's Sam? - I don't know, You sure..you want all of us? -Yes.

522
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:19,331
进去之前给大家一点建议。
Just one piece of advice for everyone before we go in there.

523
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,168
一会场面会不太好看，
This could get a little ugly.

524
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:23,197
但不管怎么样… 实话实说就好了。
but whatever you do... just... tell the truth. 

525
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,588
别净捡好听的，刚才怎么说一会儿还怎么说。
No sugar coating. Do not change a word of it.

526
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,132
谁都别自作聪明。
no one here is smart enough...

527
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:29,803
火箭科学家也是。
Including the rocket scientist.

528
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:41,190
这边。
This way please.

529
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:48,030
他已经在里面等你了。
He's already in there waiting for you.

530
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,408
很好。
Excellent!

531
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,855
大家坐吧。
Please sit down.

532
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:22,067
欢迎大家。
Welcome everyone.

533
00:46:22,901 --> 00:46:26,404
很抱歉在这么晚了叫大家过来，
I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour;

534
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:29,484
但据我所知，有些事情要马上处理！
but from what I've been told, this matter needs to be handled urgently!

535
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:32,686
事实上，我们几周前就应该处理了。
so urgently, in fact.. it probably should have been addressed weeks ago...

536
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:35,382
但现在木已成舟了。
but that is spilled milk...Under the bridge!

537
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:40,170
那么，谁和我说说到底发生了什么？
So, why doesn't somebody tell me what they think is going on here?

538
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:42,798
图尔德先生，就像我之前说的，
Well, Mr. Tuld.. as I mentioned earlier..

539
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:47,176
如果你把第13页最上面的数字和…
if you compare the figure at the top page 13...

540
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:49,096
杰瑞，你就打开天窗亮着说吧。
Jared, it's a ..just speak to me in plain english.

541
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:56,187
我要听那个把这个算出来的人说… 沙利文，对吗？
But I'd  like to speak to the guy who put this together... Mr. Sullivan is it?

542
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,230
他能直接说明白吧？
Does he speak English?

543
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,230
什么？
Sir?

544
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,942
我要和那个算出这堆问题的分析师说话。
I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.

545
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:04,154
好的，是皮特・沙利文，就在那。
Certainly, that would be Peter Sullivan. Right here.

546
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,991
哦，沙利文亲，早上好。
Oh Mr.Sullivan. You are here! Good morning.

547
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,535
也许你能告诉我这里发生了什么。
And maybe, you could tell me.. what you think is going on here.

548
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:13,789
而且请你把我当作孩子一样，解释清楚，
And please speak as you might to a young child ..

549
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,983
甚至当作金毛猎犬。
or a golden retriever.

550
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,672
这么说吧，我能坐到这个位置上不是因为我的智力。
It wasn't brains, that got me here. I can assure you of that.

551
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:29,138
好吧，也许您知道我在这和罗杰斯先生一起工作。
Well, sir. As you may or may not know I work for Mr.Rogers.

552
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:33,895
是一位风险评估管理分析师。
As an associate in the risk assessment and management office at GSMBS

553
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,489
放松点，站起来说，大点声。
Just relax, stand up. Tell us in clear voice.

554
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,883
告诉大家问题的性质。
What is the nature of the problem.

555
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,197
好的… 您也许知道，
Yes... Well as you probably know over 

556
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,245
在过去的36到40个月里，
the last 36-40 months the firm has begun

557
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,999
公司在包装新的按揭证券理财产品，
packaging new MBS products;

558
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:56,510
它是包含交易国债等
that combine several different traunches of rating 

559
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:59,923
好几块的产品组合。
classification in one tradable security.

560
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:05,678
该产品带来了很大账面收益，我想您已经留意到了。 
This has been enourmously profitable... as I imagine you noticed.

561
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:07,514
必须的。
I have.

562
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:10,475
现在公司的这个产品每天都能卖出很多。
Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day.

563
00:48:10,477 --> 00:48:14,354
我们今天在这的主要问题是…
The problem..which is I guess why we are here tonight.

564
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:17,443
我们… 公司花了大概一个月的时间…
is that it takes us... the firm, about a month...

565
00:48:17,485 --> 00:48:20,990
才能理清该产品的实际效益。
to layer these products correctly.

566
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,198
从风险控制管理的角度上来说，这很危险。
thereby posing a challenge from a risk assessment standpoint.

567
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,375
不好意思，有什么问题？
And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

568
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:30,748
我们要花上比想象多得多的时间来做效益分析。
We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.

569
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:31,874
好吧。
Yes.

570
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,682
但问题是，这些产品从本质上说，
But the key factor is here is, these are essentially 

571
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:38,455
只是抵押债款，所以允许我们大幅提高警戒杠杆，
just mortgages, that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably..

572
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:41,593
这样就使潜在风险被忽视--谁都不想的，
beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do;

573
00:48:41,594 --> 00:48:44,534
在任何其它情况下，风险会一再爆表，
in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk 

574
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:47,558
但是却不会触发任何预警。
profile without raising any red flags.

575
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:52,411
好，谢谢，请坐。我猜你这说的是，
Now, Thank you...sit down. What I am guessing, your report here says;

576
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,608
让我理下思路，
give me some rope,

577
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,984
我想你的意思是…
what I am guessing, it says is that..

578
00:48:57,277 --> 00:48:59,111
就是说，考虑到
considering the, shall we say?

579
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:02,574
过去一两周我们都在悬崖边上行走
bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so.

580
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:06,537
但你和你身边很多同事辛苦工作了这么久，到头来…
But the figures your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with..

581
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,123
这些指数报废了。
don't make much sense anymore;

582
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:12,502
所以才有了今天这一出
Considering what's taking place today?

583
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:14,460
实际上不是今天才发生的，
Actually not taking place today...

584
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:17,048
这个情况两周前就开始了。
but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.

585
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:20,202
那么你是说，这早就发生了？
So, you are saying , this had already happened?

586
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,387
是吧。
Sort of.

587
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:30,938
沙利文，你的计算模型对在座各位意味着什么？
And Mr. Sullivan, what does your model say that that means...for us here?

588
00:49:31,648 --> 00:49:33,616
这次是危机的井喷。
Well, that's where it becomes a projection.

589
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:37,278
但是… 呃…
But... ummm..

590
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:39,948
和我说话别左顾右盼，亲。
You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

591
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:42,451
好吧…
Well... sir...

592
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:48,748
如果我们账面上的这些资产下跌25%的话，
If those assets decrease..by just 25 percent, and remain on our books...

593
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,092
那损失…
that loss...

594
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:55,222
比我们整个公司现在的市值还要多。
would be greater than the current market capitalization of this entire company.

595
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:03,189
你的意思…
So what you're telling me...

596
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,558
就是说…
is that...

597
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,912
这和旋要停止了。
music is about to stop.

598
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:13,818
而我们手里攒下了整个资产阶级烂摊子的
and we are going to be left holding... 'the biggest bag of odorous excrement'

599
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:19,781
最大包垃圾?
ever assembled in the history of capitalism?

600
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,037
呃先生，我可能…
Well sir, I'm not sure I'd..

601
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:30,002
不会这样形容这件事，但是用你的话来说，
put it that way, but let me clarify...using your analogy,

602
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,213
这个模型显示…
what this model shows...

603
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:37,175
你说的和旋，开始变得拖沓了，
is the music, so to speak, just slowing,

604
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:39,770
你说的停止的情况，
If the music were to stop, as you put it,

605
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:41,848
与这个模型的结论并不接近，
then this model would not be even close;

606
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:46,854
其实这比停止了要糟糕得多。
to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.

607
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:52,151
我告诉你吧，沙利文先生。
Let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan.

608
00:50:53,862 --> 00:50:58,908
你想没想过为什么我会坐在这个位子上？
Do you care to know, why I'm in this chair with you all?

609
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:01,252
为什么我是你们的老板？
Why I earn the big bucks?

610
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:03,788
想过。
Yes.

611
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,290
我坐上这个位置只有一个原因，
I'm here for one reason

612
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,042
仅仅一个原因。
and one reason alone.

613
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:11,692
我在这里是去猜测，那乐音一周、一个月、
I'm here to guess, what the music might do, a week, a month,

614
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,507
甚至一年之后的样子。
a year from now.

615
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,486
这就是原因！
That's it!

616
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:18,070
没别的了。
nothing more...

617
00:51:20,348 --> 00:51:22,684
我今天晚上站在这…
I'm standing here tonight...

618
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:29,732
我觉得 什・么・声・音・都・没・听・到…
I'm afraid that, I don't hear... a... thing...

619
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:37,825
万籁俱寂。
just... silence!

620
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:57,137
现在你知道了，音乐停止了。我们要怎么办？
So, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it?

621
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,429
科恩? 罗伯特森?
Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson,

622
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,395
我想这是你们该表现的时候了。
I'm afraid, I think..this is where you are supposed to step back in.

623
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:09,375
我们今晚一直都在依赖沙利文先生。
Lord knows we've relied enough on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

624
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:11,820
你们有什么信息？
What have you got for us?

625
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,205
你们第一天进我办公室的时候
What have I told you since...

626
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:23,875
我对你们说了什么？
the first day you stepped into my office?

627
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:29,381
这个行业里有三种谋生技巧：
There are three ways to make a living in this business...

628
00:52:29,673 --> 00:52:33,301
拼业绩，拼头脑，拼作弊。
Be first, be smarter, or cheat.

629
00:52:33,511 --> 00:52:35,261
我不作弊。
Now, I don't cheat...

630
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:40,183
尽管我认为我们这里有很多聪明人，
And although I like to think, we've some pretty smart people in this building.

631
00:52:40,644 --> 00:52:44,162
一心搞好业绩会简单的多。
it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.

632
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,025
今天把这些卖光。
Sell it all...today!

633
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:50,930
能做到么，山姆？
Is that even possible Sam?

634
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,824
可以，但是代价呢？
Yes, but at what cost?

635
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,620
我愿意付啊。
I'll have to pay.

636
00:52:58,538 --> 00:52:59,914
真的么？
Really?

637
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,750
我这么觉得。
I think so.

638
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:05,337
这次震荡会怎么影响到我们？
Where does this gonna come back to us?

639
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:08,381
各种方式。
Everywhere.

640
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:12,969
山姆，我觉得你好像没听懂你的下属刚才说的话…
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy here had just said...

641
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:18,475
如果我要你这么做，
if I made you...

642
00:53:18,601 --> 00:53:20,511
你会怎么处理？
how would you do it?

643
00:53:26,526 --> 00:53:29,002
让交易员在早上6点半开例会，
Well, you call the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting...

644
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,088
老实跟他们说明情况。
and you be honest with them.

645
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:31,915
反正他们很快都会知道。
B'cos they're gonna know it's the end either way.

646
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,118
所以你要给他们一份奖励，很多的奖金。
so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one.

647
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,530
所以大家要赶紧跳出风暴之门…
And then, you've gotta come out of the gate storming...

648
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,915
不要掉期交易，什么都不要。
No swaps..no nothing.

649
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:45,813
10：15之前干掉40%，11点前要卖完。因为到午餐的时候，
40 percent done by 10:15; by 11 O'clock all your trades have to be gone. 'cos by lunch-time

650
00:53:45,814 --> 00:53:47,356
丑闻就会满天飞。
words are gonna be out.

651
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:52,177
到下午2点还能以65%的成本价卖出已经是算你走运了。
and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky,

652
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,349
联邦调查局的人马上就会过来找你麻烦。
and the feds will be in here up your ass trying to slow you down.

653
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,359
- 拉米什？ - 他们会让你慢下来…
- Ramesh? - They can slow you down...

654
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,813
但不能阻止你，卖的是你的资产。
but they can't stop you. it's yours to sell.

655
00:54:00,813 --> 00:54:02,522
约翰… 就算… 
John...even if..

656
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:07,444
我们能顺利走到这一步… 可不是说说就能办到...
we manage pull that off, and that's saying something...

657
00:54:08,205 --> 00:54:09,830
但真正的问题是…
The real question is...

658
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:11,249
我们要卖给谁呢？
Who are we selling this to?

659
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,870
过去两年里的那些买家，以及其他任何愿意买的人。
The same people we've been selling to for the last two years, and whoever else will buy it.

660
00:54:15,872 --> 00:54:18,524
但是，如果你这么做了
But John, If you do this.

661
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:23,588
你会让市场瘫痪好几年，那就崩了。
You would've killed that market for years. It's over.

662
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:28,341
而且你知道你卖的东西毫无价值。
And you are selling something that you know has no value.

663
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:30,763
我们以市场的价格
We are selling to willing buyers

664
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:33,065
卖给愿意购买的买家
at a current fair market price,

665
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:37,301
这样我们才能幸存！
so that WE may survive!

666
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:41,523
但以后你再也不能向那些人卖出任何东西了。
You'll never sell anything to any of those people ever again. 

667
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:43,266
- 我明白。- 真的么？
- I understand. - Do you?

668
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:45,036
你才不明白
Do You???

669
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,944
就这么定了！
This is it!

670
00:54:46,946 --> 00:54:49,398
我告诉你，就这么定了！
I'm telling you. This is it.

671
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,046
现在是… 4点钟。
It's 4:00...O'clock.

672
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:06,082
杰瑞你在5点之前给我个方案。
Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan.

673
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:10,512
除了这的人还有谁知道这件事的，哪怕一星半点？
Is there anyone else who knows what's in there right now, block by block?

674
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:12,257
埃里克・戴尔。
Eric Dale.

675
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:14,224
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

676
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:17,387
他今天已经被公司解雇了。
As of today he is no longer with the firm.

677
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:20,817
我们一直在找他。
We have been trying to locate him.

678
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:27,239
- 卡梅隆？ - 在。- 六点之前把戴尔弄回来。
- Carmelo? - Yes? - Get me Eric Dale here by Six.

679
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,158
知道了。
Done.

680
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,486
我们一小时之后再回来开会。
We meet back here in an hour.

681
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,166
山姆，我们谈谈。
Sam, let's talk.

682
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:49,939
好大一座城市。
This is a hell of a town.

683
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:53,785
我一直都很喜欢这地方。
I've always loved this place.

684
00:55:53,786 --> 00:55:57,114
从到这儿的第一天开始，喜欢这里的一切。
Since the day i arived. Everything about it.

685
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:08,084
山姆，这事上你会站在我这边么？
Sam, are you gonna go with me on this?

686
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:12,663
我不知道，约翰。
I don't know John.

687
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,585
这事儿太糟糕了。
This one is very ugly.

688
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:20,213
曾经咱们都是销售人员。
You and I were salesmen.

689
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,674
我们卖东西，这就这样，一点都不复杂。
We sell. That's what we do. It's not complicated.

690
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:24,718
没错。
Exactly.

691
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,462
因此你应该很清楚
And you know damn well..

692
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:29,931
只有保证一笔交易有所回报，今后才有持续的客源。
you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more,

693
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:33,620
我们有过教训。但明天我们就声名尽毁了。
That's the lesson we learned. and tomorrow we are done.

694
00:56:34,422 --> 00:56:35,321
可这事已经定了。
But this is it, Sam.

695
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:37,205
又是这句。你这是什么意思？
You keep saying that. What's that supposed to mean?

696
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:38,816
这次麻烦太大。
This is the big one.

697
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:42,463
我们中的大部分人都逃不出这场灾难。
Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.

698
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:45,783
- 我们？ - 整个华尔街。
- Us?  - The street.

699
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:47,325
你什么意思？
What are you talking about?

700
00:56:47,326 --> 00:56:50,687
我要面对的局面不是这周就能结束的。
This isn't  the last situation I will have to deal with this week.

701
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:52,230
这还只是个开始。
This is just the start.

702
00:56:52,332 --> 00:56:54,942
那是因为你开始了这一切。
It's the start because you are starting it.

703
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,152
也许吧。我不信就这么完了。
Maybe. But I don't believe that.

704
00:56:56,153 --> 00:56:57,296
我不要完蛋。
Not this time.

705
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,224
那些账面盈亏完全无法平衡。
The numbers just don't add up anymore.

706
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:03,142
我同意你这个观点。这话我说了多少年了。
Well I agree with you there. I've been saying that for years.

707
00:57:03,762 --> 00:57:07,598
如果那孩子算出来的这结果是对的…
I mean if this kid out there can come up with this thing...?

708
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:13,567
我没办法明知道结果还要去害其他人。
I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys.

709
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,568
山姆你什么时候变得这么慈悲了？
When did you start becoming so soft, Sam?

710
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:19,779
少来冷嘲热讽，是你自乱阵脚。
Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

711
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,508
如果你走出这第一步，
If you're the first one out the door;

712
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:26,736
没人会说我乱了阵脚。
That's not called panicking.

713
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:36,629
显然你运营的消息比我多得多。
Well, you are obviously operating with more information than i have.

714
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:41,008
但我想你这次会毁了这公司的。
But I think this could destroy this firm.

715
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:43,060
没人会再相信你了。
No one will ever trust you again.

716
00:57:43,062 --> 00:57:45,789
你在知情的情况下毁了他人的事业。彻底的。
Knowingly putting people out of business. Full stop.

717
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:50,260
我能应付的，山姆。
Let me deal with that, Sam.

718
00:58:05,746 --> 00:58:07,247
怎么样？
How'd that go?

719
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:10,316
一场闹剧。
This is a fucking shit show.

720
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:13,161
- 他们真打算这么干了？- 很可能。
- They are gonna go with it? - Probably.

721
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:16,839
疯了！
Jesus!

722
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:19,309
记住今天吧，孩子们
Remember this day boys,

723
00:58:21,095 --> 00:58:23,255
记着今天。
Remember this day.

724
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:40,863
现在采取什么策略？
What's the strategy here?

725
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,127
这正是我要下楼和他们一起研究的事情。
Well, that's why i'm headed downstairs, to work it with my guys.

726
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:46,869
你、我和约翰来研究。
No, no, you and I... With John.

727
00:58:52,672 --> 00:58:55,800
我们不需要开小会，萨拉，这不是我的处理方式。
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I do things.

728
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:58,885
求你别这样
Please.

729
00:59:00,345 --> 00:59:02,931
图尔德知道我们还没找到对策，
Listen, He knows where we are still on this.

730
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,435
一直都知道。
All along.

731
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,561
那正是我想说的。
That's exactly my point.

732
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:09,609
就算我们商讨过…
And knowing what was discussed..

733
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:15,318
你也得不到任何保证。
by both you and I. I don't think this could provide you with anything.

734
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,622
除非你有这方面的错觉。
other than, false sense of comfort.

735
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:20,751
我不是在寻求保障安慰。
I'm not looking for sense of comfort here, Sarah.

736
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:24,371
估计也求不到。
I don't think there's one to be found.

737
00:59:35,425 --> 00:59:37,877
我再问一遍，现在的对策？
So again, what's the strategy?

738
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:42,900
除了卖空我们什么也做不了。
I'm just not sure there's much more to do in this.

739
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:45,435
这事已经很清楚了，
It's very simple.

740
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:48,656
别想瞒着我。
Don't even think of fucking me on this.

741
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,400
因为如果公司要倒闭了，
because if we are going down...

742
00:59:52,862 --> 00:59:55,489
你知道大家会一起完蛋。
you damn well know we'll  be together.

743
00:59:57,574 --> 01:00:00,794
不，我不这么觉得。
No, I'm not sure I do know that.

744
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,729
你觉得图尔德去年挣了多少钱？
What do you think Tuld made last year?

745
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,259
你丫能闭嘴么？
Would you shut the fuck up.

746
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:48,086
8千6百万。
86 mil.

747
01:00:49,088 --> 01:00:51,299
光是工资和分红。
In bonuses and salary .

748
01:00:52,592 --> 01:00:53,634
真的？
Really?

749
01:00:53,635 --> 01:00:54,559
当然，有公开记录的。
Sure, it's public record.

750
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:55,762
真有钱。
That's a lot of fucking money.

751
01:00:57,547 --> 01:00:59,591
他曾有十多亿美元。
He was worth a billion.

752
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:01,517
曾经？
Was?

753
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:02,894
今天以后就不是了。
Until today.

754
01:01:03,195 --> 01:01:08,099
-是么 -走着瞧
-Really? -We'll see.

755
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:14,948
-我去煮点咖啡。你们还要点什么吗？-我的够了。
-I'm gonna get some coffee. Someone need anything else? -I'm all right.

756
01:01:14,949 --> 01:01:16,700
我需要点新鲜空气。
I could use some real air.

757
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,169
好主意。
Probably a good idea.

758
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,271
-你觉得行么 -你指什么行不行
-Is it all right, Will? -What do you mean, all right?

759
01:01:20,272 --> 01:01:21,420
我一个人出去一会  
Take it out, for a minute? 

760
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:22,874
怎么不行，你又不是囚犯
Yes, of course, you're not a prisoner.

761
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:24,375
你要我跟你手拉手散步么
You want me to hold your hand?

762
01:01:29,974 --> 01:01:32,476
你为什么要放那么多水果啊！
Why did you put all this fruit on that?

763
01:01:41,604 --> 01:01:43,437
您好，我是威尔。
Hello, Will Emerson.

764
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:44,940
喂？
Hello?

765
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:53,916
不用了谢谢，我知道了。
No, thank you. I understand.

766
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,647
我们会谨慎处理。
No, we'll be discreet.

767
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:01,657
谢您了。
Thank you.

768
01:02:01,857 --> 01:02:02,457
啥事
What?

769
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:03,959
埃里克老婆。
Eric's wife.

770
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,332
他没事 在家呢 就是不想和我们说话 
He's alive, he's home. He doesn't wanna speak to us.

771
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,856
也不知道他老婆给我打电话。
He doesn't know she rang me.

772
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:08,556
他住哪儿？
Where's he live?

773
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,641
住海兹。
The heights.

774
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:11,552
要通知图尔德手下那个卡梅隆么
Should I call Tuld's guy?

775
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:13,366
不，埃里克是自己人。迫不得已时
No.it's Eric...the last thing we need 

776
01:02:13,368 --> 01:02:15,705
才叫那些人去。你们俩去把他带回来。
is those guys going over there, you two go get him try to bring him.

777
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:17,767
但是记得要赶在6点之前。
But you've got to be back by 6:00 AM.

778
01:02:21,355 --> 01:02:22,856
我讨厌布鲁克林。
I hate Brooklyn.

779
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:29,706
我能进来么？
May I come in?

780
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:31,990
进啊。坐吧。
Of course. Please, sit down.

781
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:44,429
嗯，我们决定要这么做了…
So... we are going to do this thing.

782
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:49,927
行啊。
Okay.

783
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:52,004
可能会很紧张。
It's going to be tight.

784
01:02:54,098 --> 01:02:55,848
山姆和我们一道吗？
Is Sam on board?

785
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,510
还没有。
Not yet.

786
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:02,648
萨拉，
Sarah,

787
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:04,650
我需要一只替罪羊…
I need a head......

788
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:08,280
好对这层楼的交易员及所有股东有个交代。
to feed to the traders... on the floor and the board.

789
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:13,877
是我还是科恩？
Is it me or Cohen?

790
01:03:13,878 --> 01:03:15,079
是你。
It's you.

791
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:26,216
可是你知道…
Of course you are...

792
01:03:26,842 --> 01:03:30,739
我之前就提醒过你和科恩这件事。
well aware I filtered several warnings to you and Cohen about this .

793
01:03:30,742 --> 01:03:32,139
一年前就说过。
A year ago.

794
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:37,394
我真心觉得现在不是说这个的时候。
I really don't think that's the best path for you to be taking at this point.

795
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,026
你会得到丰厚的补偿的。
you're going to be well taken care of.

796
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:50,366
显然这有点复杂。
Obviously it's quite complicated.

797
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,535
约翰，我了解这类规矩…
John I was told that in no uncertain terms...

798
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,622
这一直是个灰色地带。
It was always a very grey area.

799
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,332
一年以前我们就把这事
Actually it was made very clear at the time,

800
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,985
说的很清楚了。
by you me and Cohen.

801
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:06,175
希望你不要再跟我提这件事了。
I'd really appreciate it that you didn't fight me on this...

802
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:20,316
我们都把这事完全搞砸了
We all fucked this one up pretty good...

803
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:28,741
我要你呆在这里直到股市收盘。
We need you to stay here till this is finished and the markets close.

804
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,661
我明白。
I understand.

805
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,247
他们会在楼下和你核对那些数据，
They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs...

806
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,502
祝你好运。
Good luck.

807
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:57,523
尼马，杰瑞来了。
Oh fuck Jared... Jared's coming.

808
01:04:58,024 --> 01:05:00,275
那家伙想干吗？
What's the boy wonder want?

809
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:07,784
有时间吗？
You got a minute?

810
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:10,736
- 我们要去接埃里克。- 我知道，就一会儿。
- We're just off to pick up Eric. - Yeah I know. Will only take a second.

811
01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:12,281
好吧，怎么了？
Alright, what is it?

812
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:15,039
我和图尔德担心在这件事上,
Tuld and I have  concerns that Sam, 

813
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,293
山姆可能无法作出正确的选择。
may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.

814
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:19,821
这事儿以前没有过？
It's never been a problem?

815
01:05:19,823 --> 01:05:21,006
没有。
No, it hasn't.

816
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:24,051
但像现在这样的敏感时期…
But, sometimes in an acute situation, Such as this...

817
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:26,971
对于究竟什么是对的
often what is right.

818
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:32,101
可能招致诸多猜疑。
Can take on, mutiple interpretations.

819
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:35,271
山姆知道该怎么做。
Sam will step up.

820
01:05:35,272 --> 01:05:36,647
我知道他会的。
Oh, I know..he will.

821
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:41,112
但是如果他不肯，我是说如果…
But if he doesn't. IF he does not...

822
01:05:41,363 --> 01:05:43,114
我们需要你准备好。
We need to know that, You will.

823
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:48,078
你们要知道我会怎么样？
You need to know that, I will... What?

824
01:05:48,787 --> 01:05:50,247
你会和我们一道。
That you will step up.

825
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,917
我相信，山姆会做出正确的选择。
I have not doubt. That Sam will make the right decision.

826
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:57,004
但我想先说清楚，
But, just to make it clear.

827
01:05:57,005 --> 01:06:00,758
他和我对什么是正确的事情，意见很一致。
He and I always have the same interpretation, Of what's right.

828
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:04,294
不管是不是什么敏感时期。
No matter, How acute... the situation.

829
01:06:57,153 --> 01:07:07,363
( 肖邦 第15号前奏曲 )

830
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:52,518
天啊，这房子真不错。
Jesus, that's a nice place.

831
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:54,862
是啊。他刚买的。
Yeah,  it is.. he just bought it.

832
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:57,900
希望他用的是现金。
I hope it was with cash.

833
01:08:58,284 --> 01:09:02,755
滚蛋，你个没良心哪壶不开提哪壶，
Fuck me. You are a heartless little shit sometimes.

834
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:04,789
不是用的现金。
and it wasn't.

835
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,537
别碰车上的按钮！
Don't touch any of the buttons!

836
01:09:14,926 --> 01:09:16,776
你在干吗？
What are you doing here?

837
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,054
嘿
Hey?

838
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:27,089
皮特把你在算的模型算完了。
So..Peter finished that model you were working on.

839
01:09:28,524 --> 01:09:29,641
真的？
Really?

840
01:09:29,743 --> 01:09:31,444
麻烦大了。
Caused a shit storm.

841
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,313
我就知道。
I bet...it did.

842
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,873
你认为他算对了吗？
Do you think he's right?

843
01:09:36,342 --> 01:09:37,959
他肯定是对的。
I know... he's right.

844
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:54,217
昨天晚上杰瑞・科恩和高级合作伙伴开了一个紧急会议。
Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the senior partners last night. 

845
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,138
基于你的计算…
Based on your findings..

846
01:09:56,764 --> 01:10:00,308
他们决定把我们所有产品全卖了。
They've decided to liquidate our entire position.

847
01:10:01,352 --> 01:10:02,895
就今天！
Today!

848
01:10:04,522 --> 01:10:06,356
我很抱歉。
I am very sorry about that.

849
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:16,608
他们担心你一个人在外面，要我把你带回去。
They are worried about you being out here. And  they want me to get you back.

850
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,496
- 搞什么  - 我建议...  - 去他的。
- Jesus! - I'm just saying.. - Fuck that.

851
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:25,795
- 好好考虑一下。- 得了，我签了字，离职了。
- Don't be rash. - Forget it, I've signed my papers. I'm out!

852
01:10:26,962 --> 01:10:28,580
他们会补偿你的。
They will pay you.

853
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:30,749
我拿了辞退补偿了。
I've been paid enough, already.

854
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:41,635
你知道我造过桥么？
Did you know I built a bridge once?

855
01:10:43,356 --> 01:10:44,189
什么？
Sorry?

856
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,565
造大桥。
A bridge.

857
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,476
没听说过啊。
No, I didn't know that.

858
01:10:47,485 --> 01:10:49,862
我当时是个工程师。
I was an engineer by trade.

859
01:10:52,156 --> 01:10:56,451
横跨俄亥俄州的多士巴 和西维吉尼亚州的玛瑟夫
It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virgina.

860
01:10:56,454 --> 01:10:59,221
距俄亥俄河上方912英尺。
It spans 912 feet above the Ohio river.

861
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:02,459
每天有1.21万人通过这座桥。
12,100 people use this thing a day.

862
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:04,418
这为惠灵和新马顿赛
And It cut out 35 miles...

863
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:08,380
每边都省去了35英里的额外路程。
of extra driving each way, between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

864
01:11:08,383 --> 01:11:10,093
加起来的话…
That's a combined...

865
01:11:10,134 --> 01:11:14,554
每天为行人节省84.7万英里
847,000 miles of driving,a day...

866
01:11:14,556 --> 01:11:19,152
等于每个月2.541千万英里
Worth 25,410,000 miles...a month;

867
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:25,449
即每年3.04亿英里
and 304 millions 920,000 miles a year.

868
01:11:25,451 --> 01:11:27,695
省了
Saved.

869
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:32,314
我在1986年完成了那项工程，22年前了。
Now, I completed that project in 1986... that's 22 years ago.

870
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:43,544
这些年来，这座桥让人少走了60.70824亿英里冤枉路。
So, Over the life of that one bridge..that's 6 billion... 708 million...240 thousand miles...that haven't had to be driven!

871
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,882
时速算50英里好了。
At what? let's say... 50 miles an hour

872
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:52,345
那就是1.341648亿个小时。
So, that's a 134 million, 164 thousand 800 hours...

873
01:11:52,346 --> 01:11:56,149
即 55.902万天。
or 559 thousand 20 days...

874
01:11:57,019 --> 01:12:04,676
所以就那一座桥就省下了 当地两个社区的居民共1531年的时间
so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined, 1531 years of their lives

875
01:12:04,735 --> 01:12:07,345
而不用在车里浪费时间。
not wasted in a fucking car...

876
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:15,120
1531年！
One thousand five hundred and 31 years!

877
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:16,664
牛啊
Jesus.

878
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,744
我觉得… 你该回去了。
I guess... you better get back over there.

879
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,019
是啊
Yeah.

880
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,022
谢谢你能来。
Thanks for coming by.

881
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,725
乐意之至
You're welcome.

882
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:48,740
那是谁？
Who the fuck is this?

883
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:51,668
还用想，公司的人呗。
I'd imagine, it's the firm's people.

884
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:53,119
啊？
What?

885
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,746
图尔德不允许大意之举。
Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.

886
01:12:56,374 --> 01:12:58,000
是他炒的我。
He fired me.

887
01:12:58,586 --> 01:12:59,836
去他丫的。
Fuck 'em... Fuck 'em.

888
01:12:59,837 --> 01:13:02,213
我同意，去他们的。所以先回公司
I totally agree...Fuck them. So, come back...

889
01:13:02,214 --> 01:13:04,407
拿好你的钱，5点你就能回家了。
take the money, You'll be home by five.

890
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:09,504
否则的话，他们会把你的什么都吞了，红包、期货…
Otherwise, they are going to fight you on everything, they are going to fight you on the package, the options...

891
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:11,557
实际点
Be smart.

892
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:20,175
好吧，你比我强。
Well..You're a better man than I.

893
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,776
这句真相了。
That's always been true.

894
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,321
对，对对。
Yes, it has.

895
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:30,952
这房子不错。
The house looks good.

896
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:34,123
谢谢。
Thanks.

897
01:13:34,124 --> 01:13:36,209
埃里克……
Hey Eric...

898
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:40,755
别老对自己这么苛刻好吗？
don't beat yourself up too much about this stuff, alright?

899
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:44,435
有的人就喜欢开半天车才能回到家。
Some people like driving the long way home.

900
01:13:44,969 --> 01:13:47,021
谁他妈知道呢，对吧？
Who the fuck knows. Right?

901
01:14:19,256 --> 01:14:21,099
啊，你在这。
There he is.

902
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:23,935
约翰。
John.

903
01:14:24,929 --> 01:14:26,730
怎么样了？
How's it looking?

904
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:29,858
科恩做的不错，可以照他说的干。
Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

905
01:14:30,435 --> 01:14:32,402
什么意思？
What does that mean?

906
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:38,492
就是说，你知道的，
It means, as you very well know,

907
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:43,038
你是我们团队很重要的成员。
that you are a very important piece of this puzzle.

908
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:15,674
你真慷慨。
That's very generous.

909
01:15:15,816 --> 01:15:17,441
这可不是白给的。
It's not a gift.

910
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:21,163
我要知道这件事上你和我同一战线。
I need to know you are with me on this.

911
01:15:23,408 --> 01:15:25,585
我和公司同一战线。
I'm with the firm John.

912
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:33,009
除非你的人相信你，否则我从这些人那什么都得不到…
I won't get what I need out of your boys on the floor, unless they believe you...

913
01:15:33,919 --> 01:15:37,347
他们得完全信任你才行。
unless they believe in you completely.

914
01:15:40,843 --> 01:15:42,727
加入我的计划吧？
Are you in, on this?

915
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:46,766
我说过了我持保留意见。
I told you my reservations.

916
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:48,651
你不能有任何保留！
You can't have reservations!

917
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:52,531
我现在就要知道！
And I need to know now.

918
01:15:54,067 --> 01:16:00,915
听着，约翰。我一直都是为公司考虑的。让我过去。
Look John..I'm  completely with the firm, as I always have been. Excuse me.

919
01:16:25,225 --> 01:16:30,396
好吧，威尔，我会被炒吗？
Alright, Will. Am I getting fired?

920
01:16:30,398 --> 01:16:32,282
我不知道。
I don't know.

921
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:39,790
好吧，基本上肯定会。
Yeah, almost definitely yes.

922
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:46,088
- 那你呢？- 我不会。
- Are you? - No.

923
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:51,310
塞斯，你没做错什么。只是你的天时地利不和。
Seth, its nothing you did. You're just in a wrong firm, in a wrong time.

924
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:53,589
年轻人总是被裁员的那个。
Young guys are always the one to get called. 

925
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,297
我没什么好劝你的。
Listen, nothing i can say'll make you feel any better.

926
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,604
你会难受一阵子，过些日子就好了。
It's gonna suck for a while... and then you'll be fine.

927
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:05,776
你还好吧？
You alright?

928
01:17:07,313 --> 01:17:08,680
嗯，我没事。
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

929
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:13,285
事情发展成这样，我也很抱歉。
For what its worth, I'm sorry this is happening to you.

930
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:17,113
不用，你没对不起我。
Don't be. You didn't do it to me.

931
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:19,698
总之，起码你走的时候会拿到一大笔钱。
Still, at least you're gonna have some nice cash to walk away with.

932
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,926
也许吧。
I guess.

933
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:26,665
- 这种事真的会影响到别人的。- 没错，像我这样的。
- This is really gonna effect people. - Yeah, it's gonna affect people like me.

934
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,508
不，我是说其他人。
No, real people.

935
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,219
拜托，塞斯。
Jesus, Seth.

936
01:17:30,255 --> 01:17:32,188
如果你真的想在这个行当做下去，
If you really wanna do this with your life. 

937
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,766
你必须相信你自己很重要。而且你的确是。
You have to believe you're necessary. And you are.

938
01:17:34,842 --> 01:17:36,816
大家想要这样的生活，香车、
People wanna live like this. In their cars and 

939
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,945
豪宅，可是他们根本都付不起。
their big fucking houses, that they can't even pay for.

940
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,605
这时候你就非常重要了。
Then, you're necessary.

941
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:44,159
他们能活得像个国王，唯一的理由是
The only reason, that they all get continue living like kings is

942
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,728
我们用手指把天平往他们那边压了一下。
'cos we got our fingers on the scales in their favour.

943
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,873
我要是把手拿开。
I take my hand off.

944
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:51,391
然后世界才是他妈的真正公平的，
Well then the whole world gets really fucking fair, 

945
01:17:51,392 --> 01:17:53,331
但是很快他们就会承受不住。
really fucking quickly and nobody asks you one shite. 

946
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,422
他们其实并不想要真正的公平。
They say they do but they don't.

947
01:17:55,448 --> 01:17:57,323
他们想要我们给他们更多的东西。
They want what we've to give them..

948
01:17:57,325 --> 01:18:02,203
但同时又想假装无辜假装不知道这些东西怎么来的。
but they also wanna you know, play innocent and pretend they've no idea where it came from.

949
01:18:02,204 --> 01:18:05,216
那就要我来为他们的这些行为埋单，尼玛的。
That's more hypocracy than I'm willing to swallow. So, fuck them.

950
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:07,217
都他妈滚蛋！
Fuck normal people!

951
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:10,722
你知道么，有趣的是，明天如果这事儿曝光了。
You know, the funny thing is. Tommorow, if all of these goes tits up.

952
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,675
他们会因为我们的“粗心”声讨我们。
They're gonna crucify us. For being, too reckless.

953
01:18:14,677 --> 01:18:16,627
但我们不这么做呢?
But if we are wrong?

954
01:18:16,829 --> 01:18:18,313
如果一切都真正公平了
And everything gets back on track.

955
01:18:19,516 --> 01:18:22,560
这帮人会在笑掉大牙后，把自己搞得一团糟。
Well then, the same people are gonna laugh until they piss their pants.

956
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:26,280
到了那时候，我们就重新变回上帝派来的亲善大使。
Because, we are gonna look like the biggest pussies that God ever let through the door.

957
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:33,013
你觉得我们错了么？
Do you think we are gonna be wrong?

958
01:18:34,574 --> 01:18:37,042
我不知道，别问我。
Nah, I don't know..fuck.

959
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:53,901
早上好。
Good morning.

960
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:55,261
皮特…
Peter...

961
01:18:55,267 --> 01:18:56,938
来一根儿？
you want one?

962
01:18:57,974 --> 01:18:59,265
我不抽烟。
I don't smoke.

963
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:02,286
好事，我也不怎么抽的。
That's good. I don't much either.

964
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:15,417
累吗？
Are you tired?

965
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:17,493
累什么？
Of what?

966
01:19:17,495 --> 01:19:19,746
我又没像你那么拼命的工作。
Remember, I don't work as hard as you do.

967
01:19:19,748 --> 01:19:20,697
不是吧。
Oh, That's not true.

968
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:22,133
其实是的。
No it is...actually.

969
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,848
- 我们今天会被解雇吗？- 也许吧。
- Are we all getting fired after today? - Probably.

970
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,101
他们会炒了你？
Are they going to fire you?

971
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:34,764
他们会换种说法。
Well, they won't exactly call it that.

972
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:40,476
算作怜悯的辞退吧。你不用陪我在这站着。
but... it'll be a mercy killing really. You don't have to stand out here for me.

973
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:45,574
我知道，我只是现在还不想回去。
No, I know. I really don't want to go back in there just yet.

974
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:48,369
我理解。
I understand that.

975
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,206
我认识你的儿子。
I think I know your son.

976
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:53,783
真的？
Really?

977
01:19:53,784 --> 01:19:57,045
不是很熟…但是看起来是个好人。
Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person.

978
01:19:57,664 --> 01:20:00,007
他是个好人。
He is a nice person.

979
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,868
的确没有那么多缺点可说。
I guess you could say a lot worse about a guy.

980
01:20:03,753 --> 01:20:05,805
他知道会发生什么吗？
Does he know what's about to happen?

981
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,683
什么意思？
What do you mean?

982
01:20:10,218 --> 01:20:11,677
你跟他说过吗？
Did you talk to him?

983
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,691
没有，我还没想到要跟他说。
No..I hadn't even thought of it.

984
01:20:21,856 --> 01:20:24,158
他们飞过来了。
They're all coming in now.

985
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:26,870
是啊都来了。
Yes they are.

986
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,877
你以前做过这样的事吗？
Have you ever done anything like this?

987
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:39,633
没有，都比不了这次。
No... never.... not even close.

988
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,143
你确定我们只能这样…
Are you sure..it's the only...

989
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,354
或者说，这么做对吗？
or the... right thing to do?

990
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,900
对谁来说？
For who?

991
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,905
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

992
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,241
我也不知道。
Neither am I.

993
01:22:45,845 --> 01:22:47,604
你没事吧？
You alright?

994
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:52,818
你要解雇我了。
You are about to fire me.

995
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:12,882
知道么，我只想在这里工作。
You know, this is.. This is all I've ever wanted to do.

996
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,142
真的？
Really?

997
01:23:50,173 --> 01:23:53,276
他们都准备差不多了，你过几分钟就来吧。
It's almost ready for you, Ms Robertson. Couple of minutes.

998
01:23:56,455 --> 01:23:57,880
你也被圈禁了？
You as well, huh?

999
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:59,682
对。
Yes.

1000
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:02,603
没想到
Jesus!

1001
01:24:04,471 --> 01:24:05,304
抱歉。
Sorry.

1002
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,399
谢谢。
Thank you.

1003
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:24,335
我还以为他们没本事把你弄回来。
I didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here.

1004
01:24:26,804 --> 01:24:29,496
他们威胁要撤销我的所有权益，
They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything

1005
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:32,926
包括下两年的期货、医疗保险
the next two years.. my options, my healthcare

1006
01:24:33,295 --> 01:24:35,680
除非我回来，挣…
or I could come back here and make...

1007
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,267
每个小时17.65万美元
$176,471.00 an hour

1008
01:24:40,635 --> 01:24:42,654
只要乖乖在这坐着。
to sit quietly...  in this room.

1009
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:47,567
我好像没别的选择。
I couldn't see much of choice.

1010
01:24:48,143 --> 01:24:50,154
从来就没得选。
It never does.

1011
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:55,900
回过头来看，
Obviously looking back,

1012
01:24:55,902 --> 01:25:00,865
之前我们没有及时地处理…
It was expressed with insufficient urgency...

1013
01:25:01,116 --> 01:25:03,293
但是你的观点是对的。
but your point was passed on...

1014
01:25:03,494 --> 01:25:05,461
我希望你理解。
I need you to know that.

1015
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,454
埃里克。
Eric.

1016
01:25:07,457 --> 01:25:10,667
没事，我理解，相信我。
Its okay, I understand, believe me.

1017
01:25:10,668 --> 01:25:13,187
你本来也做不了什么。
there was nothing you could have done.

1018
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:15,722
我觉得也是…
I guess...

1019
01:25:17,884 --> 01:25:21,645
那个时候…好像也没什么选择。
at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.

1020
01:25:22,222 --> 01:25:24,274
从来没有过。
It never does.

1021
01:25:34,486 --> 01:25:36,788
为了你的孩子?
Your kids, hah? 

1022
01:25:46,248 --> 01:25:48,675
你的补偿奖金会有多少?
What is your package going to be like?

1023
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:54,389
我不知道，我正等着呢。
I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for now.

1024
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:57,351
可能很高哦。
It probably pretty good.

1025
01:25:58,011 --> 01:26:00,021
必须是。
It better be.

1026
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:18,875
非常感谢大家能来这么早。
Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning,

1027
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:23,118
昨天是很糟糕，我指望今天能跟大家说情况有所好转，
I know yesterday was pretty bad, and I wish I could say that today is going to be less so,

1028
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:24,964
但其实并不是那样。
but that isn't going to be the case.

1029
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,708
现在我应该给你们读这份通知，
Now, I am supposed to read this statement here to you all here,

1030
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:31,638
但你们有空了自己看吧，我只想告诉你们这发生了什么。
but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.

1031
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:34,392
我昨天整宿都在这。
I've been here all night.

1032
01:26:34,759 --> 01:26:37,020
和董事会的人开会讨论。
meeting with the executive committee.

1033
01:26:37,637 --> 01:26:44,944
最终决定卖出公司几个关键财产类的所有东西。
and the decision has been made to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes.

1034
01:26:47,773 --> 01:26:50,399
问题是，在公司看来，
The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking.

1035
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,745
派对在今天早上结束了。
the party is over as of this morning.

1036
01:26:53,988 --> 01:26:58,241
在未来一段时间里，市场会有很大动荡。
There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future.

1037
01:26:58,243 --> 01:27:04,048
他们觉得，这个动荡最好从我们这里开始。
And they believe... it is better, that this turmoil begin with us...

1038
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,092
结果就是……
as a result...

1039
01:27:07,377 --> 01:27:09,512
公司决定卖出
the firm has decided to liquidate

1040
01:27:09,922 --> 01:27:13,142
大部分的固定收入的按揭证券
its majority positions of fixed income MBS..

1041
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:15,811
今天一天。
today.

1042
01:27:15,887 --> 01:27:17,803
这是你们的信函，
These are your packets,

1043
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:22,151
你们会看到你们今天的任务是什么。
you will see what accounts you are  responsible for today.

1044
01:27:22,811 --> 01:27:25,197
我想你们会很快
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to..

1045
01:27:26,189 --> 01:27:28,858
明白这次买卖的意义，
understand the implications of this sale.

1046
01:27:28,942 --> 01:27:31,863
还会对你们与竞争对手间的关系，
on your relationships with your counter-parties 

1047
01:27:31,866 --> 01:27:36,116
以及你们的事业，将产生的影响。
and as a result... on your careers.

1048
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,617
我对董事会说出了
I have expressed this

1049
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,452
真相
reality

1050
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:42,622
他们也很理解这一点。
to the executive committee and they understand.

1051
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:43,666
所以，
As a result,

1052
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:47,336
如果你能卖出你手里93%的资产，
if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets...

1053
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:52,726
你会得到140万美元的奖金。
you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

1054
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,803
如果这层楼整体
If the floor as a whole

1055
01:27:54,804 --> 01:28:03,937
销售完成了93%，你们每人会另外获得130万美元的奖励。
achieves a 93% sale you will get an additional 1.3 million a piece.

1056
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:06,690
如果你们没有经历过这样的事，
For those of you who have never been through this before,

1057
01:28:06,692 --> 01:28:10,068
那么我告诉你这就像是大甩卖的开始。
this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like.

1058
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:13,739
不用我告诉你头一个半小时有多么重要了。
I cannot begin to tell you how important first hour and half is gonna be.

1059
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:16,409
我要你们找到每一个可以找到的买家。
I want you to hit every bite you can find.

1060
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:18,536
商人、经纪人、顾客…
Dealers, brokers, clients...

1061
01:28:18,537 --> 01:28:20,380
你妈妈有意向也成。
Your mother, if she respond.

1062
01:28:21,624 --> 01:28:23,166
不要掉期交易，
No swaps.

1063
01:28:23,168 --> 01:28:26,971
我们今天只卖出。
It's outgoing only, today.

1064
01:28:28,757 --> 01:28:33,771
显然这不是我们所希望看到的，
Obviously, this isn't going  down the way that any of us would've hoped.

1065
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:37,140
但是我们脚下的大地在颤抖了，
but the ground is shifting below our feet,

1066
01:28:37,141 --> 01:28:40,361
我们也没有别的选择。
And apparently, there is no other way out.

1067
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:06,838
上帝啊，现在真的面临一个很特殊的局面…
Gods... this is Obviously, a very very unique situation...

1068
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,892
如果我们今天成功了，
if we are successful today.

1069
01:29:09,426 --> 01:29:13,238
我们同时也会成功的砸了我们以后的饭碗。
We will have been successful in destroying our own jobs...

1070
01:29:14,681 --> 01:29:17,142
我不能向你们所有人都保证…
I can not promise that any of you.. all of you...

1071
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:21,580
你们当中有一些人还是会被公司解雇。
Some of you would be repositioned within the firm.

1072
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:27,703
但我会告诉你们，我为你们今天的工作相当骄傲。
but I can tell you that, I am very proud of the work we've done here today.

1073
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:32,042
我在这家公司，
I have been at this place,

1074
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,711
已经34年了，
34 years,

1075
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:38,041
从我的经验来看，会有人为我们
I can tell you from experience, that people are going to 

1076
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:41,143
今天做的事情问候我们八辈儿祖宗。
say some very nasty things about what we do here today.

1077
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:44,763
同时也会这样问候你们所效力的公司。
about what you've dedicated a portion of your lives to.

1078
01:29:47,301 --> 01:29:50,854
但说实话，总体来说，
But have faith that in the bigger picture,

1079
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:53,246
我们展现了我们的能力，
our skills have not been wasted,

1080
01:29:53,448 --> 01:29:54,973
我们获得了许多成就，
we have accomplished much,

1081
01:29:54,975 --> 01:29:59,029
我们的天赋被用以
and our talents have been used...

1082
01:30:00,273 --> 01:30:02,575
成就更伟大的事业。
for the greater good.

1083
01:30:03,068 --> 01:30:06,912
这是你们的信函，加油干吧。
Here's your packets, get to work.

1084
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:43,525
-西铁事务所，我是埃里克。-我找埃利奥特。
- City..this is Eric.      - Give me Elliott.

1085
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:47,247
-西铁。-嘿，我是威尔・艾默生。
- City. - Hey, its Will Emerson.

1086
01:30:47,532 --> 01:30:49,266
-威廉啊，你怎么样？-我很好，最近干的怎么样？
- William, how are you? - I'm alright, how's the trouble at scribes?

1087
01:30:49,268 --> 01:30:50,543
总是输的一塌糊涂。
Busting my ass, as always.

1088
01:30:50,544 --> 01:30:51,481
你看，我试过劝你的。
You see, that's what i've been trying to tell you. 

1089
01:30:51,483 --> 01:30:52,753
嘿，你知道我要跟你说啥吗？
John, why do you thing I'm saying this?

1090
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:53,753
我知道你劝过。
I know you did.

1091
01:30:53,857 --> 01:30:55,147
你要我做什么？
What can i do for you?

1092
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:57,333
我刚得到点儿消息，
Listen, I just got tapped on my shoulder,

1093
01:30:57,335 --> 01:30:59,919
我们有点项目要转移。
we've got some words over here that we need to move.

1094
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,320
所以今天我的亏损就是你的收益。
So, today. It looks like my lost is your gain.

1095
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,747
多大的盘子？
What kind of size you're talking about?

1096
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,133
应该在你的屏幕上，我发给你了。
Should be on your screen, I just sent it.

1097
01:31:05,135 --> 01:31:08,220
- 天哪，什么价？- 96美元一股。
- Jesus, what is this gonna land? - 96 on a dollar.

1098
01:31:08,222 --> 01:31:10,473
- 91美元。- 你都拿走，94美元。
- 91? - Whole three and we're done at 94.

1099
01:31:10,474 --> 01:31:12,683
- 93.5美元？- 成交！
- 93 and a half? - Done!

1100
01:31:13,185 --> 01:31:15,775
- 交易所。- 嗨美女
- This is trading? - Hello, gorgious.

1101
01:31:15,776 --> 01:31:18,772
- 威尔，你们那怎么了？- 今天是转移交易日。
- Will, what's happening over there? - Today's moving day.

1102
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:20,713
你们阴测测的要干什么？
What's the fuck are you guys so worked up about? 

1103
01:31:20,716 --> 01:31:23,103
他们什么都没说，我只知道，
You think they tell me anything, all i know is that

1104
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:25,788
今天我的亏损就是你的收益。你对我们很友好，
today my loss is your gain. Now, you're friendly

1105
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:28,416
所以我就先找你来了。我这有2亿7千万
So, I'm coming to you first. I got two seventy mill

1106
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:31,044
的担保基金，20年付清还有15年。
a fifteen year paying at a twenty half a part.

1107
01:31:31,045 --> 01:31:33,671
- 从哪来的？- 哪来的？谁在乎这个？
- Where is it from? - Where is it from? Do you care?

1108
01:31:33,974 --> 01:31:36,458
也不是…
No, not really. Now...

1109
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:42,807
- 哪交易的？我听说你们… - 我现在只告诉了你这个事。
- Where's the trade? I'm hearing that you guys.... - I'm only sharing this with you right now!

1110
01:31:42,808 --> 01:31:45,392
- 85美元。- 成交。
- 85... - Done.

1111
01:31:46,396 --> 01:31:48,021
多维奇。
Deutsche.

1112
01:31:48,022 --> 01:31:50,607
威尔・艾默生。
It's Will Emerson.

1113
01:31:50,609 --> 01:31:53,193
- 操你妈，你这个骗子。- 不是吧，你还为那事儿生气呢？
- Fuck you, you lying bastard. - Come on, are you still angry about that.

1114
01:31:53,195 --> 01:31:55,654
甭说了，我挂了。
Word is out, i'm hanging up.

1115
01:31:55,655 --> 01:31:58,281
- 我麦罗。- 我劳伦斯。
- Merryll? - Lawrence.

1116
01:31:58,284 --> 01:32:00,910
你们在搞什么啊？
What the fuck are you guys doing over there?

1117
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:04,205
- 就是一次春季扫货。- 我听说可不是这样的。
- Just a little spring cleaning. - That is not what i'm hearing.

1118
01:32:04,207 --> 01:32:05,733
好了劳伦斯，你是个买家吗？ 
Alright, Lawrence. Are you a buyer? 

1119
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,158
不一定，什么东西？
I'm not sure anymore. Where at?

1120
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:09,327
怎么搞得，好像我在问你要卖什么货一样？
Why, it sounds like I should be asking you 'Where at.'

1121
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:12,941
3.75亿的三年付清混合担保。- 哇塞…
375 mill at third year mixed.  - Fuck me..

1122
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:15,459
你要不要？
Are you with me on this?

1123
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:18,387
- 63美分一股。- 别扯了，我挂了。
- 63 cents? - or fuck you, I'm hanging up.

1124
01:32:18,389 --> 01:32:21,891
- 就63 - 我问一下，5分钟内告诉你。
- 63.  - Let me call my man, I'll come back to you in five.

1125
01:32:21,893 --> 01:32:23,735
或者65.5?
Maybe, sixty five and five.

1126
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,114
好态度，别挂哦。
Well, alright then, stay on the line.

1127
01:32:27,315 --> 01:32:29,149
山姆，接电话。
Sam, pick up the phone.

1128
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:31,776
山姆，接电话！
Sam...get on the line!

1129
01:32:31,778 --> 01:32:34,062
- 我刚联系了劳伦斯。- 什么情况？
- I got Lawrence in now. - Where are we?

1130
01:32:34,064 --> 01:32:37,816
-63美分。-哟，买什么？ -3.75亿的混合担保
- sixty three cent. - Jesus, and what? - 375 mill at mixed day.

1131
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,786
给他65，卖了。
Get him to sixty five and hit it.

1132
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:42,205
你在开什么玩笑啊？
Are you fucking kidding me on this?

1133
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,865
这可是在一个交易上就损失了1亿美元。
That's a hundred million lost on a single trade.

1134
01:32:44,868 --> 01:32:49,387
我知道，卖了。
I understand...hit it.

1135
01:32:49,389 --> 01:32:51,957
好吧劳伦斯，65成交行么？
Well, Lawrence. We'd fill a kill at sixty five.

1136
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:54,343
行诶。
It's filled.

1137
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:17,785
干的不错。
Well done.

1138
01:33:24,452 --> 01:33:28,615
我想过来帮帮你，但他们现在就开始裁员了。
I just wanna give you heads up. They're gonna start sending a few people home now.

1139
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:35,337
- 现在？- 对，很快就完。
- Now? - Yes, I know this ends.

1140
01:33:41,244 --> 01:33:49,251
-一向如此。-即使代价高昂，你们依然很棒。
- Of course.   - And for what it worth, you're still good.

1141
01:33:53,257 --> 01:33:56,760
真的。某位高层很欣赏你的表现。
Yeah. I guess someone upstairs really likes you.

1142
01:34:49,377 --> 01:34:53,838
山姆！请坐。
Sam!  Please sit.

1143
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,059
真该好好恭喜你。
Congratulations are clearly in order.

1144
01:34:57,511 --> 01:34:59,604
我们尽力了。
We did the best we could.

1145
01:34:59,889 --> 01:35:01,690
你确实做了不少事情。
You did a hell of a job.

1146
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:04,400
我很感激，坐吧。
And I thank you for that. C'mon sit.

1147
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:06,527
不好意思我在吃东西，
Excuse me for eating, but...

1148
01:35:07,772 --> 01:35:09,814
今天真的很不容易。
It's been a long day.

1149
01:35:09,816 --> 01:35:12,285
- 你要点什么吗？- 不用了，谢谢。
- Can I get you something? - No, nothing, Thanks.

1150
01:35:16,823 --> 01:35:19,792
- 要我做什么？- 我要辞职。
- What can I do for you? - I want out.

1151
01:35:20,912 --> 01:35:23,172
我受够了，我要辞职。
I'm done, I want out.

1152
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:28,876
- 这一天大家都不容易… - 我要你把我的期货全都兑现，
- It's a very difficult day for all... - I need you to release my options,

1153
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:31,587
今天之后还值钱的话，我要我的分红，并且辞职。
If they're worth anything today, I want my bonus, I am out.

1154
01:35:31,588 --> 01:35:33,013
你可以保留你的分红，你的期货…
You'll get your bonus, your options...

1155
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:37,361
但是蛋腚点儿。我要你再帮我干24个月。行么?
and keep a calm face. But i need you to stay with me for next 24 months..OK?

1156
01:35:41,665 --> 01:35:44,760
拜托了。笑一下成么。
Oh. come on, Sam. Put a smile on your face.

1157
01:35:44,763 --> 01:35:46,823
你今天做的很好，你自己也这么说。
You did some good today, you said that yourself.

1158
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:48,731
知道吗
You know...

1159
01:35:48,733 --> 01:35:52,578
这之后我对整件事的感觉好多了。
I'm starting to feel a little better about all this whole thing.

1160
01:35:53,154 --> 01:35:56,072
山姆，你是世界上最幸运的人之一。
You're one of the luckiest guy in the world, Sam.

1161
01:35:56,074 --> 01:35:58,167
如果不是做这个你还在挖战壕呢。
You could've been digging dicks all these years.

1162
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:00,703
那倒是。
That's true.

1163
01:36:00,704 --> 01:36:04,440
那样至少地上有几个坑证明我的工作。
And if I had, at least there's some holes on the ground to show for you.

1164
01:36:06,518 --> 01:36:12,056
我就不知道我们怎么把事搞得这么恶心？
I just don't know how the hell did we fuck this up, quite so much?

1165
01:36:14,302 --> 01:36:18,689
你什么时候开始良心发现了…真受不了。
When did you start feeling so sorry for yourself..its unbearable.

1166
01:36:18,932 --> 01:36:22,267
怎么，你觉得我们今天让一些人破产了。
So, you think we might've put a few people out of business today.

1167
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:24,413
都是为了钱。
It's all for note.

1168
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:30,116
你每天做这样的事情做了都快40年了。
But you've been doing that everyday, for almost 40 years Sam

1169
01:36:30,903 --> 01:36:34,748
这里一切，以及外头的所有都是为了钱。
If this is all for note, then so is everything out there.

1170
01:36:37,702 --> 01:36:39,619
只是货币。
Its just money.

1171
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:41,380
都是虚构的。
It's made up.

1172
01:36:42,415 --> 01:36:45,000
纸币只是画着花纹的纸，所以我们不用
It's pieces of paper with a picture on it. So, we don't have to

1173
01:36:45,003 --> 01:36:47,530
为了它相互残杀，来点东西吃吧。
kill each other, just to get something to eat.

1174
01:36:48,714 --> 01:36:50,047
这没什么不对的。
Its not wrong.

1175
01:36:50,049 --> 01:36:53,134
现在和原来也没什么区别。
And it's certainly not different today, then it's ever been.

1176
01:36:54,678 --> 01:37:01,026
1637, 1797, 1819, 1937, 1957

1177
01:37:01,103 --> 01:37:03,197
1984,

1178
01:37:03,898 --> 01:37:10,528
 金融危机那些年
1901, 1907... 1929, 1937..1974

1179
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:13,657
还有1987年，那些混蛋差点整死我。
1987, Jesus! Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1180
01:37:13,658 --> 01:37:17,035
1992、1997、2000年，不管怎么取名。
92, 97..2000 and whatever we wanna call this.

1181
01:37:17,037 --> 01:37:20,598
都是同样的事，周而复始的。我们自身都难保。
All just for same thing, over and over..we can't help ourselves.

1182
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:28,693
我们会想要，嗯… 控制它、或者阻止它或者减缓它的发展。
And we wanna like uh, control it, or stop it or even slow it.

1183
01:37:28,694 --> 01:37:30,917
可是我们从未能改变过丝毫。
We haven't even since slightly altered.

1184
01:37:31,093 --> 01:37:33,145
我们只能应对。
We just react.

1185
01:37:33,888 --> 01:37:36,190
我们做对了，就能赚到很多钱。
We get a lot of money,  if we get it right.

1186
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,776
如果我们做错了，就会被这个行业抛弃。
And we get left by the side of road if we get it wrong.

1187
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:41,492
一直如此，以后也不会改变，
And there has always been, and always will be.. 

1188
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:43,263
赢家和输家的比例是不变的。
the same percentage of winners and losers

1189
01:37:43,265 --> 01:37:44,815
快乐的混蛋和悲伤的倒霉鬼，
happy fucks and sad sacks.

1190
01:37:44,816 --> 01:37:47,084
就像是肥猫和饿狗，比比皆是。
Fat cats and starving dogs, in this world.

1191
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:54,459
今天过后可能我们这样的幸运者比之前多。
Yeah, then maybe more of us today, than there ever been...

1192
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,294
但是输赢的比例，
but the percentages,

1193
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,839
和原来一模一样。
they stay exactly the same.

1194
01:38:17,477 --> 01:38:21,113
好吧我会继续干，但不是因为你的迷你演说，
I'll do it John, not but because of the little speech,

1195
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:24,243
而是我的确需要钱。
But because I need the money.

1196
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:31,632
难以置信，这么多年下来，我还是不得不为钱折腰。
Hard to believe, after all this years.. But I... need the money.

1197
01:38:41,419 --> 01:38:43,345
你要留着那小子吗？
Are you gonna keep the kid?

1198
01:38:45,374 --> 01:38:47,726
留着？他会被升职的。
Keep him? He's gonna promote him.

1199
01:38:47,926 --> 01:38:50,219
现在是全体总动员了。
It's all hands on deck now Sam.

1200
01:38:50,221 --> 01:38:52,847
这事儿之后，我们还会有很多钱可捞，
There's gonna be a lot of money to be made, coming out of this mess.

1201
01:38:52,848 --> 01:38:56,401
我们需要挖出每个能用的人来帮我们。
And they're gonna need all the brains, we can get out on here.

1202
01:40:20,593 --> 01:40:24,997
喂！我都报警了。
Hello? I've called the police.

1203
01:40:24,998 --> 01:40:33,376
-玛瑞 -山姆  -是我 -你在干嘛?
-Mary? -Sam.   -Yeah. -What are you doing?

1204
01:40:48,994 --> 01:40:56,000
-你到底在干嘛?  -艾拉死了
-Sam, what are you doing?  -Ella died.

1205
01:41:20,465 --> 01:41:24,978
我从兽医那回家后，想不到还能去哪儿。
I went home from the vet and I couldn't think of where alse to go.

1206
01:41:25,889 --> 01:41:28,024
她属于这里。
She belongs here.

1207
01:41:28,466 --> 01:41:33,403
我知道，但你已经不住在这了。
I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.

1208
01:41:37,151 --> 01:41:42,914
你没事吧？你看起来不太好。
Are you alright? You don't look so good.

1209
01:41:43,783 --> 01:41:46,452
没事，今天一天绷紧了弦。
Yeah, it's been a rough day all the way around.

1210
01:41:46,454 --> 01:41:47,969
我知道，儿子打过电话。
I know, Sammy called.

1211
01:41:48,271 --> 01:41:49,754
他还好么？
Is he alright?

1212
01:41:49,764 --> 01:41:51,040
他们裁了很多人，
They got hammered,

1213
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:53,342
但他没被裁。
but he got out alive.

1214
01:41:53,343 --> 01:41:55,086
那就好。
Good.

1215
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:08,558
好吧，我先回去睡了。
Well, I am going to go back inside and go back to bed.

1216
01:42:08,559 --> 01:42:12,905
警报开着，所以别想闯进来。
The alarm is on so don't try and break in.

1217
01:42:21,617 --> 01:42:24,252
你自己保重啊。
Take care of yourself, OK?
