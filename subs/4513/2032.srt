Love rises with the day

136
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:14,207
也许今夜我就能来到你身旁
and tonight I may be by your side

137
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:19,496
而明天我依旧会飞翔
But tomorrow I will fly

138
01:28:21,913 --> 01:28:26,933
明天我依旧会飞翔
Tomorrow I will fly

139
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:34,501
明天我依旧会飞翔
Tomorrow I will fly
