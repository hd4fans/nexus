是，我们会把他安排妥当的

咱们周一早上真得早点了

亲爱的，你能出去买包烟吗？
Go out and get us some fags, love, would you?

6
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,701
好吧
Yeah.

7
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,205
克里特，去吧

8
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,702
给你自己买点糖

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,172
抱歉，老兄，嗯
Sorry, mate. Aye.

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,879
出了夫人之外，现在还没有人走
No one's heading out now except for the missus.

11
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,057
爸爸让你去买烟呢。-他叫你去的
- Dad wants you to get some fags.- He asked you.

12
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,395
那怎么了，上次是我去的
It doesn't matter. I went last time.

13
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,311
喝牛奶吗，克里特？-不喝了
- Do you want a glass of milk, Collette? - No, I'm fine.

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,315
睡觉之前别忘了刷牙，亲爱的
Don't forget to brush your teeth before you go to bed, love.

15
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,068
去呀。-不去
- Go on.- No.

16
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
我给你点钱
I'll give you some money.

17
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,324
别说了，该走了。-嗯，我这就来，这就来
- Stop talking and get ready.- Aye, I'm coming. I'm coming.

18
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,244
给我买点糖
Get me some sweets.

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,785
快跑！快！他们来了！
Run! Come on. They're coming!

20
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,738
妈！爸爸！
Ma! Dad!

21
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,991
上帝呀！他被枪打了，天呐！-怎么回事？
- Jesus Christ! He's shot. Jesus.- What happened'?

22
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,827
他被枪打中了，爸爸。-什么？谁？肖恩？
- He got shot, Dad. - What? Who is it? Sean?

23
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,156
是肖恩吗？天呐，格里
Is it Sean? God, Gerry.

24
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,575
呼吸！看在上帝的份上，呼吸！
Breathe, for Jesus' sake, breathe.

25

去拿个毛巾
Get a towel. Get a towel.

26
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,999
躲开！
Get out the way!

27
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,920
呼吸，呼吸！
Just breathe. Just breathe for me.Go on, please.

28
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,843
快给我，快他妈给我
Give that to me. Get the fucking...

29

天呐！
God.

00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,012
格里
Gerry.

31
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,009
我的天呐
Jesus Christ. Jesus.

32
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,856
肖恩，肖恩，天呐，肖恩，天呐
Sean, Sean. God. Sean, Sean. God.

33
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,437
肖恩
Sean.

34
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,533
天呐
God. God. God. God.

35
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,370
坚持住，肖恩
Please, God. Sean. God, no.

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,292
不
No.

37
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,807
借过
Excuse me.

38
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,727
小心月台与车厢的缝隙
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

39
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,732
小心月台与车厢的缝隙
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

40
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,699
小心月台与车厢的缝隙
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

41
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,829
女士们，先生们，请注意
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,your attention please.</i>

42
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,664
紧急通知
<i>Due to a reported emergency,</i>

43
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,172
请所有乘客立即离开站台
<i>will all passengers leave the station immediately?</i>

44
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,105
女士们，先生们，请注意
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.</i>

45
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,357
紧急通知
<i>Due to a reported emergency,</i>

46
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,861
请所有乘客立即离开站台
<i>will all passengers leave the station immediately?</i>

47
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,549
你要水还是咖啡？
Do you want water? Coffee?

48
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,891
找不到你要的资料
It's not gonna give you what you want

49
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,810
你们的律师需要的资料也没有
or what your family's lawyers expect.

50
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,556
不过这可能会有帮助
But it might help.

51
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,614
一时半会儿且完不了呢 
This could take a while.

52
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,199
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

53
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,037
我可不这么想
I doubt it.

54
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,291
好
OK.

55
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,505
那么，你知道我们已经掌握了这些情况
So, a lot of this you know we know.

56
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,213
有些情况你还是不了解
Some of it you definitely don't.

57
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,019
比如说这个，记得他吗？
Like this. Remember him?

58
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,852
你肯定认识
'Course you do.

59
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,230
看着他
Look at him.

60
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,656
亨利·劳斯，你在他的印刷厂工作过
Henry Laws. You used to work in his print factory.

61
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,328
你告诉的康纳，他是预备役军人
You told Connor he was a part-time soldier.

62
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,375
你负责侦查，格里下的命令，康纳开的枪
You scouted it. Gerry ordered it.Connor pulled the trigger.

63
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,919
亨利的妻子在尸体中找到了他们的孩子
Henry's wife found their kids clinging to the corpse.

64
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,935
很显然他的家人不知道，但一周之后
Now obviously his family didn't know,but a week later,

65
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,355
你参加了葬礼，为什么？
you went to the funeral.Why did you do that'?

66
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,277
好吧，看看临时取证
OK. Provisional forensics.

67
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,035
这可不是为了把你的兄弟们弄回来准备的
This is definitely not one for the brothers back home.

68
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,959
这份东西将会带出很多棘手的问题
This would definitely lead to a lot of awkward questions.

69
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,628
我猜你可能想的是
So I guess this is how you figured it.

70
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,206
你放下包，打个电话，他们发出警报
You leave the bag. You make the call.They place a warning.

71
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,042
火车上有个炸弹
There's a bomb on a train somewhere on the line.

72
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,219
我们必须把整个铁路网关闭
We have to close down the whole network.

73
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,047
我们找到了炸药包，把它拿到安全地点引爆
We find the bag.We carry out a controlled explosion,

74
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,101
这是的兄弟们在家完全想不到的，对吗？
and that way your brothers at home never find out, right?

75
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:37,065
你根本就没装定时器，克里特
You never set the timer, Collette.

76
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,646
我想请个律师
I want a lawyer.

77
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,775
作为一个恐怖分子不能让自己……我要找个律师
- A terrorist who can't bring herself to...- I want a lawyer.

78
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,669
我告诉你你会被怎么处置吧
Let me tell you what it's going to be like.

79
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,843
爱尔兰姑娘，蹲英国监狱
Irish girl. English jail.

80
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,846
每次你想见你儿子或者你儿子想见你的时候
Every time you want to see your boy,every time he wants to see you,

81
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,852
孩子他奶奶就会带着他乘坐渡船航行400英里（643公里）过来看你
his grandma's gonna have to load him onto the ferry and drive 400 miles.

82
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,521
这会让他很伤心的
It's gonna break his fucking heart.

83
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,869
你知道你的兄弟们去年杀了多少人吗？
Do you know how many people your brothers killed last year?

84
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,203
今年这些牺牲者仍然或者，克里特
This year's victims are still walking around, Collette.

85
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,200
他们洗衣服……
They're doing the washing.

86
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,288
把孩子放在学校里
They're dropping their kids at school.

87
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,464
你完全可以让他们保持现状
You can keep it that way.

88
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,802
你知道，现在所有人都在谈论和平
You see, now that everybody's talking peace,

89
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:54,058
这个词就是你们这些头领觉得格里的问题所在
the word is that your leaders think that Gerry's the problem.

90
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,053
他不想让这种事发生
He's not going to let them sell out.

91
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,058
那么他到底想干什么？
So how far is he gonna go? What's he gonna do?

92
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,314
你如果同意去监视他并且向我们报告，
You agree to watch him and talk to us,

93
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,897
你就可以像什么都没发生过一样离开这儿
and you're out of here like nothing ever happened.

94
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,909
回到你的母亲还孩子那去
Back to your ma. Back to your boy.

95
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,075
我们会付钱给你
We'll Pay you...

96
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,204
以后如果你想离开这儿，我们会想办法把你送走
And one day, if you want it, we'll give you a life far away from this.

97
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,668
不会有人死
Nobody dies.

98
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,496
不会有人受伤
Nobody gets hurt.

99
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,381
我们只需谈谈
We just talk.

100
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,927
我要请个律师
I want a lawyer.

101
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,180
这不是你的风格，克里特
This isn't who you are, Collette.

102
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,928
你他妈怎么知道我什么风格？
How the fuck would you know who I am?

103
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,102
我连怎么弄坏的
I know it bugs the hell out of you

104
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,775
你妈妈的洗衣机都知道
that your mum won't get the washing machine fixed.

105
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,607
我还知道你一直纳闷你儿子为什么还在尿床
I know you're asking yourself why your boy still wets his bed at night.

106
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,612
去你大爷的！
Fuck off.

107
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,113
而且我还知道你来这之前很孤独
And I know you were so lonely the night before you came down here

108
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:58,365
甚至把一些你根本不喜欢的男人带回家
that you went home with some guy you don't even like.

109
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,449
我要找个律师
I want a lawyer.

110
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,123
你想请多少律师都行
You can have all the fucking lawyers you like,

111
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,545
但是有一件事是改变不了的
but it's not gonna change a thing.

112
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,965
我们抓住你了，你完了
We've got you. You're finished. You're done.

113
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,213
你儿子也完了
So is your boy.

114
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,635
你瞧
Look.

115
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,090
这是一份管束你儿子的文件
There's the paperwork to have him taken into care.

116
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,482
你真想找个律师吗？你真想走这条路？
You really want a lawyer? You wanna go that way?

117
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,487
拨9就是外线
Just dial 9 for an outside line.

118
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,839
是的，爱尔兰共和军继续坚称这是出于和平的目的
<i>Yes, the IRA does continue to insist it's serious about peace,</i>

119
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,095
但是这种口号将渐渐失去民心
<i>but a lot of people are going to find that hard to credit</i>

120
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,598
共和军组织试图派来
<i>when the organisation appears to be trying to send</i>

121
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,348
一切青年男女到这里来
<i>young men and women over here</i>

122
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,347
在伦敦的交通运输系统中释放人体炸弹
<i>to place bombs on the London transport network.</i>

123
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,601
目前，警方怀疑这张照片上的人
<i>And now the police have issued this photograph</i>

124
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,184
就是今晚的炸弹释放者
<i>of the alleged bomber tonight.</i>

125
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,859
照片有些模糊
<i>It is a little indistinct.</i>

126
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,530
这是在她进入隧道之前被监控拍下的画面
<i>It was taken from the security camera before she went into that tunnel,</i>

127
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,778
但警方希望有人能通过这张照片认出这个人
<i>but they hope that someone will recognise her from it.</i>

128
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,953
现在，播放其他新闻
<i>Now, in other news,</i>

129
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,158
政府将在今天的晚些时候做出决定……
<i>and the government is expected to give its decision later today...</i>

130
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,263
他们会杀了我
They'll kill me.

131
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,266
他们不会知道的
They'll never know.

132
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,854
他们会的
They will.

133
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,108
我会在那24小时监视的
I'll be there, day and night, watching.

134
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,662
你以前这么干过吗？-是的
- Have you done this before? - Yes.

135
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,996
他们后来还活着吗？-是的，都活着呢。
- Are any of them still alive? - Yes, all of them.

136
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,003
直到你不再需要他们为之吧
Till you don't need them any more.

137
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,376
我们是一起行动的
We do this together.

138
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,719
但是我得听你说出来
But I need to hear you say it.

139
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,591
你得想好了
You have to be sure.

140
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,434
我想好了
I'm sure.

141
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:44,261
这是我们的暗号，记住它，然后把它烧了
So this is our number. Memorise it, then burn the paper.

142
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,763
所有事都要听迪克兰的
Always ask for Declan.

143
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,392
他是你的新男朋友，那是你的掩护身份
He's your new boyfriend. That's your cover story.

144
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,520
我们在每周三的午夜时分见面
So we meet every Wednesday at midday

145
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,854
地点在皇后码头的停车场，从这周开始
at the car park in the quay at Queen's Island starting this week.

146
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,689
你就在那溜达就行了，我会找到你的
You just walk around until I find you.

147
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,283
你要是觉得有人跟踪你就一直走，别停
You think you're being followed, don't stop.

148
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,203
用房间里的座机
Don't use the phone at the house.

149
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,246
要是有人看见你在电话亭里，就告诉他们是给你男朋友打的
Anyone sees you in a phone box, just say it's a love affair

150
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,791
你不想让你妈妈听到
you don't want your mother to hear about.

151
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,672
你会用得上这个的，这是一个紧急呼叫器
You're gonna need this. It's an emergency bleeper.

152
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,293
把它藏好
Hide it well.

153
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,382
你按下这个扭之后，很多人就会展开行动
You press that button, half the world will come running.

154
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,635
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

155
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,637
什么事都要问迪克兰
Always ask for Declan.

156
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,054
我是说你的真名
I mean your real name.

157
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,434
你不知道最好
It's better you don't know.

158
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,726
你要是出了差错，我就完了
If you make a mistake, I'm dead.

159
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,280
是吧？
Right?

160
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,907
我想知道你的真名
I'd like to know your name.

161
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,869
麦克
Mac.

162
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,711
那么咱们就后天在码头见了
So I'll see you at the quay the day after tomorrow.

163
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,506
你可一定要去啊
You make damn sure you're there.

164
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,226
他在哪呢？-在后院玩儿呢
- Where is he? - He's out the back.

165
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,854
他没事
He's fine.

166
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,628
马克
Mark.

167
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,804
走开
Go away.

168
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,766
嘿，过来。-走开
- Hey. Come here. - Leave me alone.

169
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,438
过来，过来
Come here. Come here.

170
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,813
没事了
You're all right.

171
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,406
我看看
Let's see.

172
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,081
我看见了，一，二，三，四，五……
I can see one, two, three, four, five...

173
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,376
你们怎么样？我听说我们的姑娘回来了
How youse all doing? We heard a rumour our girl was back.

174
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,046
嘿，格里。-嘿，妈妈
- Hi, Gerry.- Hi, Ma.

175
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,215
嘿，康纳。-嘿，妈妈
- Hi, Connor.- Hi, Ma.

176
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,712
见到你很高兴，-见到你很高兴，最近怎么样？
- Good to see you.- Good to see you. How's it going?

177
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,009
新闻上都说了
It was all over the news.

178
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,589
对咱妈好点儿，她最近情绪不太好
So just be careful with Ma. She's been a bit upset.

179
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,848
你怎么样啊，小人儿？-我和爱尔兰总理一致同意
- All right, wee man? - The Taoiseach and I are agreed

180
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,771
在北爱尔兰问题上发出联合宣言
<i>on a joint declaration on Northern Ireland.</i>

181
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,067
绝不妥协，坚持原则
<i>It makes no compromise on strongly held principles.</i>

182
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,487
你听见了吗？-哦，我在报纸上看了
- You heard about this, right? - Aye, I read about it.

183
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,908
我们的要求简洁而清晰，抵制暴力行为
<i>Our message is clear and simple. There is no future in violence.</i>

184
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,032
共和党领导人连姆·休斯做出了回应
<i>Republican leader Liam Hughes gave his reaction.</i>

185
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,706
共和党人对此感到十分失望
<i>Republicans are very disappointed about what they've heard here today,</i>

186
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,330
但是我们会慎重考虑这份协议
<i>but we will give this document serious consideration</i>

187
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,707
并且对此做好了推动的准备
<i>and stand ready to move the process forward.</i>

188
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,584
但在此后……
<i>But even after...</i>

189
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,509
把胡萝卜吃完
Finish your carrot, there.

190
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,806
写作业之前想踢会儿球吗？
Want to play some football before you start your homework?

191
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:55,929
好啊
OK.

192
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,014
那，怎么了？你被跟踪了？
So, what, were you being followed?

193
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,772
不是全天候的
Not all the time.

194
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,359
我觉得他们在火车上安排了人
I think there was some of them on the train,

195
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,112
所以我下车跑了
so I got off and ran.

196
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,068
跑进隧道了了？-嗯
- Into a tunnel? - Aye.

197
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,620
有胆无谋
Brave. Stupid.

198
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,833
你应该跟凯文谈谈
You'll need to talk to Kevin.

199
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,520
累死我了
Jesus Christ.

200
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,073
他没事了，挺好的
He's all right, so he is.

201
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,790
你怎么样？
How are you?

202
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,368
我没事
I'm fine.

203
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,912
我瞧瞧
See that.

204
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,875
格里说什么了？
What did Gerry say?

205
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,380
我应该跟凯文谈谈
I have to talk to Kevin.

206
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,056
为什么？
Why?

207
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,133
因为格里说了
Because Gerry says so.

208
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,191
家里这边怎么样？
How are things here?

209
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,649
挺好的，很平静
It's OK. It's quiet.

210
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,826
你还记得皮尔吗？
Remember that peeler who tried to put us away

211
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,499
把咱们从印刷厂赶出来那个
for your boss at the print works?

212
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,160
我们现在知道他住哪
We know where he lives.

213
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,334
也许你礼拜五应该来
Maybe you'd like to be a part of it.Friday.

214
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,094
我回房间了，格里，作业还没写呢
I'm going up to my room, Granny. I've got to do my homework.

215
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,001
可以走了，先生
There you go, sir.

216
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,319
嘿。-好的，帕特，谢谢
- Hey.- OK, Pat, thanks.

217
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,202
恭喜。-你的注意
- Congratulations. - Your idea.

218
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,283
但是你去抓捕的
But it was your catch.

219
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,869
她真的参与行动了吗？-看看就知道了
- Is she really in? - We'll see.

220
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,006
他们会让她越过凯文马尔维尔
Well, they'll run her past Kevin Mulville.

221
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,463
他们现在比以前更疯狂了
They're even more paranoid than normal at the minute.

222
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,923
没事儿，她很聪明，会有办法的。-那就好
- It's OK. She's smart. She'll be fine.- Good.

223
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,319
走了。-拜
- Have a good day.- Bye.

224
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,325
一会见
See you later.

225
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,369
操
Shite!

226
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,170
我跟康纳说了把它修好
I asked Connor to fix that.

227
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,835
咱得把格里叫回来，妈
We need to get Gerry in, Ma.

228
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,136
康纳连自己的头发都搞不定
Connor can't fix his own hair.

229
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,812
她不来
She's not coming.

230
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,873
嘿，格里。-嘿，亲爱的
- Hi, Granny.- Hi, love.

231
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,299
有人找你
You have a visitor.

232
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,941
嗨，马克，你怎么样？
All right, Mark. What about you?

233
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,442
还好吗？
Are you all right?

234
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,030
你好，凯文。-克里特，你怎么样？
- Hello, Kevin. - Collette, what about you?

235
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,909
嘿，你先去，我马上就来
Hey, you. I'll be there in a second. Go through.

236
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,538
你儿子真不错
That's a beautiful wee young fella you have.

237
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,837
有点像你，凯文
That's kind of you, Kevin.

238
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,290
咱们得谈谈伦敦的事儿
We just need to talk about London.

239
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,756
待会的，我得给他泡茶去
Later. I've got to give him his tea.

240
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,014
志愿者从不推卸责任，克里特
A volunteer is never off duty, Collette.

241
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,635
一个母亲也不会，凯文
Neither is a mammy, Kevin.

242
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,853
好吧，没问题
All right. No problem.

243
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,487
那咱明天再说。-嗯
- Tomorrow, then.- Aye.

244
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,906
他来干吗？
What the fuck's he doing here?

245
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,534
他是爷爷，康纳，他正要走呢
He's grand, Connor.He was just leaving.

246
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,742
我正在做我的工作，康纳。-去你妈的，上别地儿做去！
- Just doing me job, Connor.- Fuck off and do it somewhere else.

247
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,043
明天见，克里特
See you tomorrow, Collette.

248
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,496
傻逼
Prick.

249
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,175
这儿可没有他可干的事
He's no business coming to this house.

250
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,764
你好，格里。-凯文
- All right, Gerry? - Kevin.

251
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,389
你是来找我的吗？-不是，克里特叫我来的
- Are you looking for me or something? - No, I was just calling in for Collette.

252
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,890
格里可真不懂事
Gerry should be keeping him in line.

253
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,688
她眼里只有她的儿子
Her hands are full there with the young fella.

254
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,561
妈妈 -马克
- Mummy? - Mark?

255
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,238
我能吃点蛋糕吗？-可以
- Can I have some cake? - All right.

256
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,170
开门！警察
Open up! Police!

257
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,800
妈！
Ma!

258
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,004
妈妈！-你们不能就这么闯进来
- Mummy! - You have no business breaking in here.

259
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,261
你以为你是谁呀？-穿上衣服，麦克维小姐
- Who do you think you are? - Get dressed, Miss McVeigh.

260
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,101
马克在哪？-穿上衣服。
- Where's Mark? - Get dressed.

261
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,350
别抓她，听着，我们受够了
Leave her. Leave her alone. Look, we've had enough.

262
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,899
我们受的苦够多的了。她还有个孩子需要照顾呢，天呐！
- We've all had enough. - She's a mother, for God's sake.

263
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,148
我也有个孩子，那又怎样？
I'm a fa, but what does that change? Nothing.

264
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,524
让她先穿好衣服
Well, let her get dressed.

265
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,071
你是有个儿子吗？麦克维夫人？
Are you looking after the boy, Mrs McVeigh?

266
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,070
妈妈。-马克，天呐！
- Mummy? - Mark. Jesus Christ.

267
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,776
过来，快点，你个小混蛋
Come on, hurry up, you wee bitch.

268
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,827
妈妈1-没事的，儿子
- Mummy! - You're all right, son.

269
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,280
快点！-过来，亲爱的
- Come on! - Look, come here, love.

270
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,248
没事的，亲爱的
It's all right, darling.

271
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,666
别挡道
Get out of the way.

272
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,252
好了，马克，马克
All right, Mark. Mark.

273
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,831
没事，亲爱的，没事。-妈妈！
- You're OK, darling. You're OK. - Mum!

274
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,426
把她带出去
Bring her out.

275
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,343
快点，自己走两步儿
Come on. Move yourself.

276
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,059
你怎没去呀？
Where were you?

277
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,770
我得照顾我儿子，走不开
I was looking after my son. I couldn't get away.

278
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,691
我把你从终身监禁的惩罚里解救出来
So I save you from a lifetime in a prison cell,

279
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,243
你跟我这儿假门假事地说你不能来接头
and you're seriously gonna sit here and tell me that you didn't turn up

280
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,663
就因为你他妈找不到一个保姆？
because you couldn't find a fucking nanny?

281
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,536
你有一分钟的时间告诉点情报
You've got one minute to give me something,

282
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:46,958
否则咱们的协议作废
otherwise the deal's off,

283
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,128
而且你会在走廊里看到你的被指控文件
and you're down that corridor looking at a charge sheet.

284
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,832
对不起
I'm sorry.

285
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,877
你见到你那些兄弟了吗？
Have you seen your brothers?

286
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,011
嗯
Aye.

287
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,260
格里是怎么看那份宣言的？
What does Gerry think of the declaration?

288
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,593
没什么看法。-他是怎么说的？
- Not much.- What did he say about it?

289
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,803
我不知道
I don't know.

290
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,854
有天下午他在你家附近出现了
He was round your place the other afternoon

291
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,149
就在那份文件被签署之后，新闻上现在全都是这个
just after the document was signed. It was all over the news.

292
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,443
他对此怎么看？
What did he say about it?

293
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,907
告诉我他有什么行动，运作，计划之类的
So tell me what's moving. Operations, plans.

294
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,327
我不知道
I don't know.

295
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,703
你知道么？
You know what?

296
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,707
这样可不行
This isn't gonna work.

297
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,548
你还是找个律师吧
You need to call a lawyer.

298
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,759
明天……
There's something tomorrow.

299
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,941
康纳想要把我们支开
Connor's going to get the detective

300
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:04,740
去杀印刷厂的老板
who tried to put us away for the murder of my boss at the print works.

301
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,329
在哪？-我不知道
- Where? - I don't know.

302
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,960
什么时候？
What time?

303
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,008
他没说，我知道的就这些了
He didn't say. That's all I can tell you.

304
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,471
他说他已经跟詹金斯说了
He said he was called Jenkins.

305
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,927
他问我上周都去哪了
He wants to know where I was last week,

306
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,104
都干什么了
what was I doing?

307
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,227
好吧，咱们再来一遍
OK, let's go over it again.

308
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,441
我记住了
I've got it.

309
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,901
好吧，他们不会马上来找你
OK. So they might not come at you straight away,

310
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,905
所以小心点，别放松警惕
so be careful. Don't drop your guard.

311
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,830
好了，该走了
OK, it's time to go.

312
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,371
你该走了
You should go.

313
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,231
妈妈
Mummy?

314
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,031
我尿床了，对不起
I wet my bed. I'm sorry.

315
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:26,155
别担心，没事的
No worries. You're all right.

316
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,835
他没事吧？
Is he OK?

317
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,630
嗯。-他都好几个月没尿床了
- Aye.- He hasn't done this for months.

318
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:46,551
克里特，如果你不告诉格里你不想干了
Collette, if you won't tell Gerry that you've had enough,

319
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,219
我会告诉他的
I will.

320
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,169
嘿，杰夫，你今天早上还去伦敦吗？
Hey, Geoff. Are you still going to London in the morning?

321
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,918
不去了，我得参加一个TCG的紧急会议
No, I got pulled into this last minute TCG meeting.

322
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,719
什么会？
What meeting?

323
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,055
可能只有受邀请的才能参加吧
Guess it's invitation only.

324
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,945
这不扯淡呢么，你们不会是认真的吧
Please tell me this is bullshit. You can't be serious.

325
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,781
你们把英国空军特种部队都搬到他的后院去
You're going to put the SAS in his back garden?

326
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,616
德里克·汉德森是我们自己人
Derek Henderson is one of our own.

327
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,451
我们不能坐在这就为……-告诉他吧
- We can't just sit here and... - Tell him.

328
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,003
你要这么干的话，咱们的线人就死定了
You do this, our player's dead.

329
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,967
听着，我们有个机会
Look, we have a chance here

330
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,468
能把康纳·麦克维一网打尽，我们必须抓住这个机会
to take Connor McVeigh's entire team out of circulation, and we have to take it.

331
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,265
你们设这么一个套，这些人的父母都会被牵连进来
You lay an ambush, there'll be the mother and father of all tout-hunts.

332
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,764
干脆把她的名字直接发到贝尔法斯特去呢
You might as well print her name in the Belfast fucking Telegraph.

333
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,811
别冲动
Come on. You're overreacting.

334
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,563
我得给伦敦打个电话
I'm gonna call London.

335
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,518
在我跟布坎南谈过之后，所有事都给我暂停
I want everything on hold until I've spoken to Buchannan.

336
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,978
我已经跟他谈过了，麦克
I've already spoken to him, Mac.

337
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:43,622
这他妈都怎么回事啊？-我怎么知道
- What the fuck is this all about? - How should I know?

338
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,588
你把康纳·麦克维的消息给我们，我们把他拿下
You give us Connor McVeigh, we're gonna take him.

339
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,045
剩下的是你自己的问题
The rest of it is your problem.

340
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,655
克里特？-我操
- Collette? - Jesus fucking...

341
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,949
几点了？-六点
- What time is it? - It's 6:00.

342
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,623
怎么了？
What's going on?

343
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,839
布莱恩·弗林昨晚上被抓了，我们需要你
Brian Flynn was picked up last night. We need you.

344
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,085
我跟马克保证过要送他去上学
I promised I'd take Mark to school.

345
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,092
妈妈会带他去的
He's fine with Ma.

346
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,174
起来吧，穿好衣服
Get up. Get dressed.

347
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,344
不行，康纳，我都跟马克保证过了
No, I promised Mark, Connor.

348
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,273
是不是出什么事了？
Is something wrong?

349
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,319
没有。-穿衣服
- No. - Get dressed.

350
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,322
汉德森的车每天早上七点
Henderson pulls out of a cul-de-sac off the Newtownards Road

351
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,121
会从新唐纳德路一条死胡同里开出来
at 7:30 on the nail every day.

352
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,453
他的车是一辆银色的格拉纳达
He drives a silver Granada.

353
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:09,962
咱们分别把住两边的出口，布兰登去做事
You block one side, we block the other and Brendan does the business.

354
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,469
明白了吗？-嗯
- Have you got that? - Aye.

355
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,031
你们要是想喝咖啡也行
Youse can have coffee, if you prefer.

356
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,870
放下吧
Put it down.

357
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,810
康纳，我去趟厕所
Connor, I'm going to the toilet.

358
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,730
克里特，你完事了吗？
Collette, are you ready?

359
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,531
我找迪克兰
I need to speak to Declan.

360
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,536
克里特？
Collette?

361
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,333
克里特，你没事吧？
Collette, are you ready?

362
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,802
克里特，克里特
<i>- Collette? - Collette.</i>

363
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,264
听好，我得跟我的兄弟们出去一趟
Listen, I've had to come on a wee trip with my brother.

364
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,216
我在里边，我在里边
I'm inside. I'm inside.

365
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,346
不
No.

366
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,406
你没事吧？
Are you OK?

367
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,569
嗯，没事
Aye, I'm fine.

368
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,661
该走了。-好
- We're ready.- Right.

369
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,326
拿着这个，跟我一块来
Put this on. You're coming with me.

370
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,917
什么？-你跟着一起去
- What? - You're coming with me.

371
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,318
我的天呐！出去！出去！-我的天
- Jesus Christ! Get out! Get out! - My God.

372
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,238
妈妈
Mummy!

373
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,038
钥匙呢？钥匙呢？
Where's the key? Where's the fucking key?

374
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,119
在我丈夫那儿
My husband has the key.

375
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,787
有什么消息吗？
So what have you got? Anything?

376
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,170
枪手的名字叫布莱登·奥谢。他在重症护理病房
<i>The shooter's name is Brendan O'Shea. He's in intensive care.</i>

377
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,342
很难说他能不能被抢救过来
<i>It's touch and go whether he'll make it.</i>

378
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,261
马维尔呢？-我们还在找
<i>- Mulville? - We 're still looking.</i>

379
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,589
好
OK.

380
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,058
真他妈操蛋
What a fucking mess.

381
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,897
感谢你能来，巴里
Thanks for coming by, Barry.

382
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,196
回见
Talk later.

383
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,845
得拉文之前是什么？
What was all that with Delavine earlier?

384
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,064
是不是感觉被排挤在外了？麦克？
Are you feeling left out, Mac?

385
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,768
这么说你是从另外一个角度办案的？-不是
- So you're working another angle? - No.

386
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,398
别担心，我们还是一拨的
Relax, we're all on the same side.

387
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,247
我找迪克兰。-稍等
- Can I speak to Declan? - Hold the <i>line.</i>

388
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,425
对，我是迪克兰
<i>Yeah, this is Declan.</i>

389
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,507
他死了吗？
<i>Is he dead?</i>

390
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,089
他在医院，不过伤得挺重
He's in the hospital,but it's not looking good.

391
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,893
我给你打电话的时候他进来了
He came in when I was talking to you.

392
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,605
他听见你打电话了？-嗯
- Did he hear you? - Aye.

393
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,933
好，我们会处理的
OK, we'll deal with it.

394
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,610
如果他能活着，仅此而已
If he's alive, that's it.

395
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,276
我说了，我们会处理的
<i>I said we'll deal with it.</i>

396
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,445
好吧，好吧
Right, right.

397
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,972
凯文
Kevin.

398
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,599
咱们得谈谈
We need to talk.

399
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,474
嗯。-现在就说
- Aye.- Now.

400
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,988
随便坐吧，克里特
Have a seat there for yourself, Collette.

401
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,286
喝咖啡吗？
Do you want a coffee?

402
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,379
来一大杯
Be grand.

403
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,063
第一次听说手术是什么时候，克里特？
When did you first hear about the operation, Collette?

404
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,611
今天早上在车里。-早上在车里？
- This morning in the car.- In the car this morning?

405
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,986
嗯。-你确定吗？
- Aye.- Are you sure about that?

406
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,197
嗯
Aye.

407
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:07,991
之前没提到过吗？-没有
- No mention of it before then? - No.

408
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,832
康纳给了你点线索？-没有
- Connor drop you a few hints? - No.

409
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,882
用不用我们把那个想要把你带走的家伙处理掉？
We were going to take out the guy who tried to put you away?

410
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:20,886
不用
No.

411
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,476
是这样，克里特
See, it's like this, Collette.

412
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,189
只有两个人知道行动的时间和地点，对吧？
Only two men knew the time and the place, right?

413
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,107
格里不可能说出去
And it's hardly our Gerry squealing to the Brits.

414
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,685
那么，是不是他那个毛头小子兄弟干的？
So, is it his shaggy-haired brother?

415
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,735
或者是他跟他妹妹说了
Or did he blab his fat mouth off to his sister?

416
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,318
我们在伦敦把你跟丢了
We lose you in London,

417
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,075
但是你之后又跟没事人似的回来了
but then you're back like nothing ever happened.

418
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,156
然后警察就去敲你妈妈家的门
Then the peelers bash in your Ma's door,

419
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,536
把你抓到卡斯尔雷去了
haul you off to Castlereagh.

420
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,541
结果你下午就回来了，就跟什么都没发生一样
But you're back by tea time,like nothing ever happened.

421
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,256
他们知道我离开了一阵子
Sure they knew I'd been away for a while.

422
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:02,337
谁？-一个英国人
- Who? - A man. An English fella.

423
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,263
他叫什么？-詹金斯
- What was his name? - Jenkins.

424
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,512
ML5？-有可能
- Ml5? - Probably, aye.

425
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,100
他想干吗？
What did he want?

426
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,729
我在哪？我都干些什么？
Where was I'? What had I been doing?

427
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,190
你怎么说的？
What did you say?

428
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,990
我说我去南边看我的姑妈
I said I was visiting my auntie in the south.

429
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,235
没带着儿子？
Without your son?

430
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,876
我告诉他有人跟我一块去的
I told him I was going with a fella there.

431
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,879
是谁叫你干这些的？-麦克
- Which one asked you about it all, now? - Mac.

432
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,003
麦克是谁？
Who's Mac?

433
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,682
你不是说他叫詹金斯吗
You said his name was Jenkins.

434
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,807
他的全名是麦克·詹金斯
Well, Mac Jenkins, that's his name.

435
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,608
那你跟他还挺熟的咯？
So you were friendly then?

436
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,982
叫得这么亲密
First name terms and all that.

437
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,866
你危险了，克里特·麦克维
You're red-lighted, Collette McVeigh.

438
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,249
别离开贝尔法斯特，你的事还没完呢
Don't leave Belfast. We're not done yet.

439
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,992
他在哪？-他正在跟上帝忏悔呢
- Where is he? - He's making his excuses to our Lord.

440
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,823
太愁人了，是吧？
So sad, isn't it?

441
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,376
他说他想再跟克里特谈一次
He said he wants to talk to Collette again.

442
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,551
这可不行，格里。你得让凯文撤回来
That's not right, Gerry. You need to tell Kevin to back off.

443
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,879
这事出了之后，他得再跟她谈谈
After what's just happened, he'll need to talk to her again.

444
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,555
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

445
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,055
我在医院听说布兰登死了
Just heard from the hospital.Brendan's dead.

446
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,980
天呐
Christ.

447
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,848
是你杀了他吗？
Did you kill him?

448
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,522
是你把他杀了吗？-冷静
- Did you fucking kill him? - Calm down.

449
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,066
没有
No.

450
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,817
你是不是想杀他？
Were you going to?

451
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,161
你是不是想杀他？
Were you going to?

452
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,931
凯文知道了，他警告我了
Kevin knows. He's red-lighted me.

453
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,977
他不知道，他想诈你
No, he doesn't. It's his job to make you think he knows.

454
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,690
这种事他最拿手了
Well, he's brilliant at it then.

455
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,988
你说过不会死人
You said, "Nobody dies",

456
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,442
不会有人受伤。-克里特
- "nobody gets hurt".- Collette!

457
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,253
克里特，亲爱的
Collette, love.

458
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,443
人真他妈多
Fucking loads of them.

459
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,708
你会跟他们谈谈吗？
Do you want to talk to these guys?

460
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,290
我会去的，好吗？
I'll do the talking, OK? Yeah?

461
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,470
你们得让我们过去
Youse will have to let us through.

462
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,644
早上好，我们不能让你们过去
Good morning. We agreed none of this would happen.

463
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,063
我们还就得过去。-你知道这是违法的，休斯先生
- Yes, we did. - You know the law, Mr Hughes.

464
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,856
是，我知道。-那就好
- Yes, I do.- Good.

465
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,648
你不能为一个平民开脱，在我这行不通
You're not going to bury this man as a soldier. Not on my watch.

466
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,571
这什么也没有。-那是个有色政党
- There's nothing here.- That's a colour party.

467
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,114
那只是一些缅怀逝者的人
It's a few grieving men.

468
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,988
你觉得我好骗是吗？
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

469
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,947
你们把气氛搞得太敌对了。我们不会惹麻烦的
Do you realise how antagonistic this is? There'll be no trouble from us.

470
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,532
走吧，格里。-听着，我们不想惹麻烦
- Come on, Gerry. - Listen, no trouble...

471
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,833
我们得保证安定团结
Just make sure there isn't.

472
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,919
格里
Gerry.

473
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,462
格里
Gerry.

474
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,794
走开
Walk away.

475
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,294
把你的人带走，听见了吗？
Move your men back. Do you hear?

476
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,761
保持警戒
Stay where you are.

477
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,188
想想办法，利亚姆。-你知道我没办法
- Better stand in, Liam.- You know I can't.

478
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,895
圣父，圣子，圣灵
Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.

479
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,571
上帝啊
For God's sake.

480
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,957
利亚姆
Liam.

481
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,418
有什么要说的吗，休斯先生？
Any comments, Mr Hughes?

482
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,503
看这儿，利亚姆
Look over here, Liam.

483
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,413
你好吗？
All right?

484
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,335
你怎么样？-你还好吗？
- What about you? - What about you?

485
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,143
康纳在哪？-我觉得他可能在后边
- Where's Connor? - I think he's in the back room there.

486
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,811
好，-嗯
- Right.- Aye.

487
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,892
再见，咱们一会见。-没事，保重
- See you. I'll see youse in a wee bit. - No bother, take it easy.

488
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,947
今天的事搞得我们很被动，知道么？
What happened today makes us look bad, understand?

489
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,652
这让我们内部产生分歧
It makes us look divided.

490
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,830
你们现在想停火
Youse want a ceasefire now.

491
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,453
我们还没说到那一步呢，格里
We're not there yet, Gerry.

492
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,877
我们没到那一步，但你们到了
We're not there, but youse are.

493
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,204
英国人正在谈一件很严肃的……
The Brits are talking about a serious...

494
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,664
一份投降协议，那就是谈判的内容
A document of surrender,that's what's on the table.

495
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,125
英国人在针对我们的行动
The Brits are talking about a serious response

496
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,801
做出很坚决的回应。-那是一份停战协议
- to any gesture we make.- It's a document of surrender.

497
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,629
你说的不对，你错了
You've no fucking right. No fucking right.

498
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:34,680
这是大头儿的决定，格里，你不能有疑议
- The leadership decides, Gerry. - You don't represent us.

499
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:35,851
你决定从来就没对过
You never fucking have.

500
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,975
这是大头儿的决定。-从来就没对过
- The leadership decides.- Never fucking have.

501
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,440
这是领袖的决定，格里
The leadership decides, Gerry.

502
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:44,941
你现在给我冷静点，傻逼孩子
Now cop yourself on. Fucking child.

503
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,496
嘿，你好，老兄
Hiya. How you doing, man?

504
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,422
嘿，小妞，你好吗？-很好
- Hey, pet, are you all right? - All right.

505
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,569
你出来啦，克里特？
You away there, Collette?

506
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,022
嗯，已经开始了
Aye. Aye, it's getting on.

507
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:34,987
别忘了给可怜的布兰登的父母一点尊重
Don't forget to pay your respects to poor Brendan's parents.

508
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,543
实际上，我想问问你，凯文
Actually, I've been meaning to ask you, Kevin.

509
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,503
你现在是在保护我的兄弟吗？
Are you my brother's keeper, now?

510
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,513
我会尽力保护他们的，克里特
I'll do what I have to do, Collette.

511
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,636
今天是你儿子的生日吧
I believe it's your wee boy's birthday.

512
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,102
给他买个足球什么的
Get a football or something.

513
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,411
谢谢你了，凯文。-没事
- That's kind of you, Kevin. - Don't worry about it.

514
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,432
请出示证件，先生
Identification please, sir.

515
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,641
好了，谢谢
That's fine. Thank you.

516
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,521
麦克？
Mac?

517
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,696
进来
Come in.

518
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,957
进来说吧
We'll go in here.

519
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,329
路易
Louie.

520
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,953
你先出去
Can you give us a minute

521
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:52,540
去别的屋跟你爸聊会儿去
and go and talk to Daddy a minute in the other room?

522
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,504
好了，喝什么？-不用了，谢谢
- Right, drink? - No, thanks.

523
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,010
行了，这可是周末
Come on. It's the weekend.

524
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:07,230
我要知道你是一个人就请你过来了
If I had known you were on your own,I would have invited you over.

525
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:17,532
你为什么把汉德森的文件锁起来了？
Why have you locked the Henderson file?

526
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,486
也许是伦敦的案子。-不是伦敦的
- Maybe it was London. - It wasn't London.

527
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:22,241
巴瑞·德莱文是跟我一拨的
Barry Delavine works my side of the street.

528
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,412
如果他被调到你手下
If he was pumping your hand,

529
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,331
那就说明他对汉德森的案子有了其他的办法
that means he's got another angle on Henderson.

530
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,875
其他的办法的意思是其他的情报
Another angle means another tout.

531
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,877
你找了其他的人、-麦克
- So you got someone else.- Mac.

532
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:37,631
但是找克里特·麦克维是你的主意，现在我不明白了
But Collette McVeigh was your idea, so I'm asking myself why.

533
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,838
你知道么，我花了八个月的时间让她刺探情报
You know, I spend eight months reeling her in,

534
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,765
但是你一开始就想置她于死地，为什么？
and you're prepared to burn her on day one. Why?

535
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,137
我会告诉你原因的
<i>I'll tell you why I think.</i>

536
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,720
我认为麦克维就快拿到巴瑞的情报了
I think Mulville was getting close to Barry's tout,

537
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:50,899
结果你弄来一帮傻逼跟着瞎搅合
and you just wanted some fucking red meat to throw him.

538
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,476
我想把她摘出来。-那不可能
- I want to take her out.- That's out of the question.

539
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,153
听着，他们会认为她为我们工作，这样无论如何
Look, they'll assume she's one of ours, so she'll still take the heat off

540
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,153
她仍然能得到你的保护。-别做梦了
- whoever it is you're trying to protect.- That's fantasy.

541
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:02,361
而且，她还仅仅是开了个头
Besides, she's only just got started.

542
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,164
她把我们交待的事情都做了。-行了，麦克
- She's done what we asked of her.- Come on, Mac.

543
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:11,081
一个新身份，新护照，一所房子和一份收入
A new identity, protection, a house,income for life.

544
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:14,539
这得多少？一百万？
What is that? A million?

545
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,716
就为了让她当了八个月的卧底？
Throw into that eight months' work setting her up.

546
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,169
别傻了
It's more like two.

547
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,675
你以为伦敦方面会仅仅因为
You think London's going to buy all that

548
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:26,009
对康纳·麦克维的帮派的一次袭击就全部买单吗？别做梦了
just for one good hit on Connor McVeigh's crew'? Forget it.

549
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,642
我们可是有言在先。-我不会允许的
- We made a deal.- I absolutely forbid it.

550
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,982
凯特，她还有个儿子呢
Kate, she's got a son.

551
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,816
你是不是迷上她了，麦克？
Is this because she has a pretty face, Mac?

552
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,529
我觉得你没那么傻啊
Because I thought you were a lot smarter than that.

553
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,403
喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

554
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,043
来啦
There you go.

555
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,719
你猜这是什么？不想打开看看吗？
What do you think that is? Are you just gonna look at it?

556
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,922
他根本就没动。-打开它，马克
- He's doing nothing.- Open it, Mark.

557
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,928
来吧。-拆开看看
- Go on.- Open it up.

558
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,893
看。-把包装撕掉
- Look.- Just rip it off.

559
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,306
包装还挺结实的，是吧？
It's quality wrapping right there, isn't it?

560
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,266
快呀，撕开它
Go on. Rip it open.

561
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,863
看呐。-你喜欢吗？
- Look at that.- Do you like it?

562
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,778
很不错吧？-是啊
- It's a good one, isn't it? - Yeah.

563
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,079
你觉得大小合适吗？-我觉得没问题
- Reckon you're big enough for it? - I think so.

564
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:31,749
这车很快的。骑起来很快，知道么
It's very fast.A very fast bike this, you know.

565
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,327
我来检查一下
I'm just gonna check the old...

566
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,083
看上去不错
It looks good.

567
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,500
好了，骑上吧
All right, get up on it.

568
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,134
好了，我撒手了啊。耶！
OK, off you go. Yeah!

569
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,932
太好了！
Yes! Perfect.

570
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:52,479
转个圈。闸好使吗？-好使
- Turn round. Is the brakes all right? - They're fine.

571
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:56,478
试试闸，骑到这然后捏闸
Check them when you... Just try them out down here.

572
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,777
慢点，别停，别停……
Slow it down. Keep going. Keep going.Keep...

573
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,489
很好，现在是上坡了
Perfect. It's all uphill now of course.

574
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,864
他骑得真不错。-有模有样的
- He's doing all right. - Looks great.

575
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,288
我觉得咱们这个礼物算是送对了。-可不是么
- I think we done a good job there. - I think so.

576
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,957
骑快点儿。-你看他那小脸儿
- Just go faster. - Look at his face.

577
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,625
再快点儿。-加油
- Faster. - Come on.

578
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,213
加油，很好。-马克·麦克维
- Go on. Perfect. - Mark McVeigh!

579
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,102
马克？
Mark?

580
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,977
好，加油，好的，20秒
Right, come on. Right, 20 seconds.

581
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,983
21秒，躲开那里，好的
Twenty-two seconds, off you go.There you go.

582
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,154
非常好……
That's all right. That's 20...

583
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:47,279
别说了，妈，求你了，至少今天别说
Don't start, Ma, please. Not today.

584
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,986
回来，你上哪去？
Come back now. Where you going? That's 23...

585
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:52,367
你要去哪啊？他这样会摔着的
Where you going? He's gonna kill himself.

586
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,541
让他停下，不，停，停，停……
Stop him going. No, stop.Stop, stop, stop.

587
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,254
你来这儿干嘛？麦克。-帮我个忙
- What are you doing here, Mac? - I need a favour.

588
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,677
你都退出这个项目很久了
You were all out of those a long time ago.

589
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:10,052
他们正在找格里·麦克维的情报，对吧？
They're hunting a tout in Gerry McVeigh's crowd, right?

590
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,387
有一阵子了吧？
Have been for a while?

591
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,312
快一年了
Maybe a year.

592
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,649
他们知道有人跟格里很熟
They know it's someone close to Gerry.

593
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,773
格里什么反应？
What's Gerry doing about it?

594
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,822
他听取了我们的朋友凯文·马尔维的意见
He's listening to our friend, Kevin Mulville.

595
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,943
你认识马尔维，麦克
You know Mulville, Mac.

596
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:33,701
除非他把某人杀掉，否则他是不会善罢甘休的
He won't stop until he's put a bullet in someone's head.

597
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,965
我一会就回来
Be back in a wee bit.

598
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,721
我约了看医生
I have a doctor's appointment.

599
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,891
你不能带上马克吗？
Can't you take Mark with you?

600
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,889
你去哪？-郊区
- Where are you going? - Downtown.

601
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:41,438
等一等。-求你了，妈，我得走了
- Then going downtown can wait.- Please, Ma. I've got to go.

602
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,312
你去郊区干吗？克里特？
What are you going to do in the town, Collette?

603
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,063
别问了，妈
Please, Ma.

604
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,481
你用不着去郊区。-我得走了
- No one has to go downtown.- I've got to go.

605
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,873
你迟到了。-我这不来了么
- You're late. - I'm here. I've made it.

606
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,171
你要见我，我就来了，我妈为此很生气
You've seen me. I've got to go.My mother's raging.

607
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,543
克里特。-凯文盯上我了
- Collette. - Kevin's watching me.

608
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,546
听着，咱们以前就这么干都没事。-天呐
- Look, we've been through this before. - For Christ's sake.

609
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:13,300
听我说。你还有工作要做。-我的工作就是摆脱这些
- Listen to me. You've got a job to do. - My job is to end up in a ditch.

610
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,903
不，你还没干完呢。-我干完了
- No, it's not going to end up like that. - Aye, it is.

611
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:17,550
你要振作起来，否则这根本无济于事
You've got to pull yourself together, otherwise this isn't going to work.

612
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,681
你自己选吧
You made your choice.

613
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,481
我完了，我完了，我自己选了一条死路
I'm dead. I'm dead.That's the choice I've made.

614
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,354
不，你不会完的
No, you're not. That is not gonna happen.

615
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:28,026
我会保护你的
I'm not gonna let that happen.

616
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,297
对不起
I'm sorry.

617
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,785
我得把你带出去
I've got to take you out.

618
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,578
现在只有我帮你了，明白吗？
It's just me, you understand?

619
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,375
他们有自己的计划，如果我要把你带出来，我们只能靠自己
They've got their own agenda, so if I take you out, we're on our own.

620
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,971
我需要几天的时间
I'll need a few days.

621
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:43,477
我可以带上你儿子，你明白吗？
I can take your boy but nothing else, you understand?

622
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,140
你明白吗，克里特？
Do you understand, Collette?

623
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,777
礼拜一的三点我在这等着
I'll be here at 3:00 on Monday.

624
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,909
肯定的，政客说的全都是谎话
Sure, the politics of it is all bollocks.

625
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:45,081
要是真这么来，我们自己搞都比这个强
If it comes to it, we'll go our own way and be better for it.

626
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,871
但是我们身上要背着事儿就什么都干不了
But we're nothing if we're not clean.

627
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,420
情报上说咱们有案底
And a tout means we're dirty.

628
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:04,388
格里，我撑不了多久
Gerry, I can't hold on any longer.

629
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,969
咱们都不行
We can't.

630
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,816
肯定是你身边的人告的密
It's someone close to you. It has to be.

631
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,273
你得跟我保证
I need the word now.

632
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,960
别担心
Don't worry about it.

633
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,316
你好，杰夫，我是麦克。-嘿，麦克
- Hello, Geoff. It's Mac.- Hi, Mac.

634
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,493
听着，我正在写一份报告
Yeah, listen, I'm just doing a bit of paperwork here.

635
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:07,196
你知道汉德森的那个案子吗？
You know the Henderson operation last week?

636
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,748
他们有没有把硬拷贝存进档案室里？
Do you know if they've put a hard copy in the library yet?

637
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,871
不清楚，怎么了？
<i>Not sure. Why?</i>

638
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,873
我进不去档案
I can't seem to get in.

639
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,580
你能把密码告诉我吗？
You couldn't dig me out the agent code, could you?

640
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:19,007
你记一下。-好的
<i>- You got a pen? - Yeah, shoot.</i>

641
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,927
实际上，有两份报告
<i>Actually, there's two on the incident report.</i>

642
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,050
那就对了，把两份都给我吧
That's all right. Just give me them both.

643
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,975
<i>672545 'I/MIU</i>

644
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,975
<i>5736917/LPN.</i>

645
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,034
咱们再说一遍好吗，康纳？
So let's try this one more time, Connor, '?

646
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:19,412
你什么时候跟你姐说的袭警的事？
When did you tell your sister about the attack on the peeler?

647
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,838
去你妈的
Fuck you.

648
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,748
继续
Go on.

649
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,517
好吧
All right.

650
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,486
你要是没告诉她就说明你是那个告密者，康纳
If you didn't tell her, then that means you're the squealer, right, Connor?

651
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,314
帮我个忙。-你怎么老有要帮忙的事呢
- I need a favour. - You always need a favour.

652
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,734
我要找一份卡斯尔雷的录音
I need to look at some of the records from Castlereagh.

653
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:24,935
为什么？
Why?

654
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,238
我要查一下82年四月所有的审讯记录
I want to check out everyone that was brought in for interview or interrogation

655
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,863
为什么？
- around April '82. - I said, "Why?"

656
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,365
你知道他们多谨慎吗
You know how uptight they are.

657
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,711
帮帮忙，伊恩。咱们各司其主，对吧？
Come on, Ian. Everyone's got to fight for their guy, right?

658
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,005
这事瞒不了多久了
I don't think mine's got long left.

659
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,635
最后一次机会，康纳
Last chance, Connor.

660
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,595
杀了我吧
Just fucking do it.

661
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,893
来呀
Fucking do it.

662
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,824
他不是我们要找的人
He's not the one we're looking for.

663
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,253
82年几月？-4月
- '82. What month? - April.

664
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,974
拿去吧
