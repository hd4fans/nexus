1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:02,296
Starting...

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,664
ALEX CROSS

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,106
2012

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,074
Enjoy!

5
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,348
Would you like to die?

6
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,974
Hold it.
Drop it.

7
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,353
Stand still.

8
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,091
Wait a minute, guys.
It's not safe.

9
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,942
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

10
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:25,168
It is good.
You're safe now.

11
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:31,826
How is she?
- She's alive. More so than the others.

12
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:35,766
Monica, what about that shot
in the kneecap?

13
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:40,615
It's like working with sixth graders
with you two. I'll see you later.

14
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:09,761
You have ten minutes.

15
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,863
Now look there.

16
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:19,145
The sky is lit.

17
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:23,076
There are many stars outside the prison.

18
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:26,508
Sit down then we make our game off.

19
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,035
You know I know you
two people who did not kill.

20
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:38,310
You need inspected.
But you look after me.

21
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,126
I've killed.

22
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,968
Properly.

23
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:48,465
17 years old.
Never convicted.

24
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:53,520
Pop Pop, something's not right.
- Because I was smart. I always came away with.

25
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,848
You're smart, but your uncle Daramus,
that guy is really smart.

26
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:04,193
Long criminal record. If he for two murders
was condemned, he was there.

27
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,207
He is not here, do you?
- No, you do.

28
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,651
Do you think it is noble what you do?
- Is that a hypothetical question?

29
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,490
Yes, that is noble.

30
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:23,883
You can not save everyone, Dr. Cross.
- I'm not trying to save everyone.

31
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:28,039
Only you.

32
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:56,934
It is very good,
but at that piece ...

33
00:04:56,935 --> 00:05:01,698
if you're doing like
Stevie Wonder ...

34
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,540
Let's hear it.

35
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:10,029
Janelle, have you done your homework?

36
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,046
No, I'm just some math
and history do.

37
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,857
That's what you do so after dinner?

38
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:18,861
I do not think so.
Go upstairs and do your homework.

39
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,826
Chain gang.

40
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:26,268
Is there something wrong with you?

41
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:29,189
Ms?
- Take your foot off my couch.

42
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,585
Honey, can you help me?

43
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:43,120
Mary, you enter to something.
What is it?

44
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,290
Top shelf. I can not reach.

45
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,124
The only thing to be married to you
to be is that they are small.

46
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:51,403
What is going on?

47
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:56,880
Look around and tell what's new.
- A game?

48
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:00,876
What's in it for me?
- Your pride.

49
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,812
Properly.

50
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:09,388
But if I win and get it right?
- We'll see.

51
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,556
Where do you start?
With the front door?

52
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,347
Or the screen door you made.
No more squeak.

53
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,623
You have coffee with someone
before you went home.

54
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,715
A Latte.
There is some foam on your blouse.

55
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,829
You stopped when you did your job.
You have the car washed.

56
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,442
Had tanked and did some disinfectant.
- Go on.

57
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:31,066
Changes the lipstick.
Red wine is gone.

58
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,855
Creams and Fog.

59
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,781
Not bad.

60
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:41,694
But that's all insignificant.
You obviously need a clue.

61
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,992
I need a clue.

62
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:48,298
It was very close.
- Very close. Look.

63
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,895
I do not know what that might be.
Perhaps the echo in the printer?

64
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,075
Who told you that?

65
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,312
Is that for us?
- That's our child.

66
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:15,832
You're pregnant. We're having a baby.
- Are you okay?

67
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:27,740
How far have you been?
- Eight weeks pass.

68
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,630
It's our secret until I'm 12 weeks away.
Can you do that for as long as you keep it?

69
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,898
I'm not pregnant
by talking.

70
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:42,243
I think we have him or her,
Alex should call.

71
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,644
This can for both.

72
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,841
Really?

73
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:58,268
Food in 20 minutes.

74
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,847
That looks good.

75
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,680
You look like the cat that
ate the canary.

76
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,796
You do not know everything.

77
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,170
Put me down.
- No.

78
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:30,375
I'm just happy.
Very, very happy.

79
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,151
I'm at the line.

80
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:57,124
The transfer is diverted.
You know where to find her.

81
00:08:57,244 --> 00:09:02,526
All.
Do you understand that?

82
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,028
You are the manager.
- On good days.

83
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:48,922
We want to bet.
- Who?

84
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:53,502
"The Butcher of Slygo '.
- The fight here.

85
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:56,598
You look at him.

86
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,701
We have a car.
We do not run.

87
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:05,082
10000 The Butcher and 1,000 for you.

88
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,781
I do not get much for a day's work.

89
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:27,797
The locker room is above on the right.

90
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,229
<i> That's what I mean. </ i>

91
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:35,332
<i> Look at him. </ i>

92
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,944
<i> We do a special impromptu game. </ i>

93
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:42,680
<i> With my husband,
a heavyweight champion ... </ i>

94
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,813
<i> Dinant Stansi. </ i>

95
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,475
<i> Get him, champ. </ i>

96
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,704
<i> Easy earned this.
That guy can not weigh more than ... </ i>

97
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,289
<i> than 58 pounds. </ i>

98
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,573
<i> He must have a death wish. </ i>

99
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:12,484
<i> Give him applause, but I do not know
why he does this. </ i>

100
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:18,725
<i> The Butcher or Slygo. </ i>

101
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,108
I want a nice fair fight.
Understood?

102
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,851
Are you ready to be beaten up?

103
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:33,058
Do not hit me in my face,
otherwise you never fight.

104
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:36,435
Apart.
In your corner.

105
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,839
Ready to fight?

106
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,442
Come on.

107
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:51,516
Come, let me show you my favorite part
of the house.

108
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,681
You have powerful enemies?

109
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,507
He's clean.

110
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:23,857
You have a statue of Guan Yu.
The god of war.

111
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,654
War is a passionate company
of strategy and willpower.

112
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:33,636
Just like sex.
It therefore belongs to the bed stand.

113
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,905
The war was declared.

114
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:58,700
And now my favorite part.

115
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,109
Unconditional surrender.

116
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:13,567
Take off your panties and give them to me.

117
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,107
Do you like it?

118
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:58,767
Say it again.
- I like it.

119
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:15,025
I can not have.

120
00:16:56,651 --> 00:17:00,325
No.

121
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:14,257
Sorry, boss. What is going on?
- There are four shot.

122
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,301
Four shot? Where?

123
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:21,244
414 Lake Shore Drive.
- Our district.

124
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:24,697
I give this to you and Tommy Kane.
Important.

125
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:28,777
Alex, this you must prepare.

126
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,798
A woman is tortured to death.
Understood?

127
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:45,155
Let's see who it is.
It's Alex.

128
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,290
I need this record.

129
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:58,136
Come on, Tommy. Record.
- What is it?

130
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:03,459
There are four shot and tortured.
Where are you?

131
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:09,070
I'm in a card game.
I'm winning.

132
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:12,440
You are on the cards and you win.

133
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,942
Redeem your money and tell me
where I can pick up.

134
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:22,049
You can pick me up at the corner
Saint Albin and Mac.

135
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,570
I'll see you there soon.

136
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,358
There is a multiple murder.
I gotta go.

137
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:38,396
Are you worried?
- No. Why?

138
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:41,590
You're pretty pissed your pants on.

139
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,027
I'm such an open book?
- To me you will.

140
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:49,038
What do you think I am for him?

141
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:53,785
From early on we are already best friends.
If I'm lying to him, he knows that.

142
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,355
We have been careful.

143
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:59,188
Caution?
Do you think we can take him in the leg?

144
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:03,017
This guy can tell you scrambled eggs
've had for breakfast from 90 feet away.

145
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:05,428
I lie way not like him.

146
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,025
Confess it up.
Tell him what he already knows.

147
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,795
That's not good for your future
and your career.

148
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:17,623
I know.
But I'm good at my job.

149
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:22,495
And Alex knows that.
- Yes, Alex knows the rules too.

150
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,003
And this is what we do ...

151
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,356
that should not go.
- But so it is.

152
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,876
And we are here.
- And it's only two months.

153
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:40,714
We must give some time to make sure
to be that this is real.

154
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:41,717
And if that's ...

155
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:46,650
we have difficult decisions
ahead.

156
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:52,344
You're the guy that my father said
that I had to avoid like the plague.

157
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,153
I like to watch you and I hate it
to you in the middle of the night to see leave.

158
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,445
One day you look at me ...

159
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:06,206
I like my donuts suds and slurp my coffee ...

160
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:11,621
and then beg you to me to be saved.
- The easy Irish charm. Forget it.

161
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:39,103
I thought how very way you've changed
since high school. Guess what?

162
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,657
I know what you're talking about and where you
worry about. It's just one thing.

163
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:47,213
Do not tell me I do not have to worry.
Briana was one thing, Skyler was one thing ...

164
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:51,021
Monica is not a thing that is dangerous.
I assume you're not a fool.

165
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:55,156
So simple is not it.
- Why do you say that to me?

166
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:59,386
I feel something for her.
Maybe I'm in love with her.

167
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,570
I'll make it easier for you
in case you do not understand.

168
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:07,769
You and her team brings us, me, you
and my family in danger.

169
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,451
I do not want to take that risk.

170
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:14,536
You need to stop, or someone must leave.
- I got it.

171
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:18,860
You're gonna do?
- What did you do today?

172
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,166
You do have more on your mind
than my sex life?

173
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:27,038
I get a job with the FBI, man.

174
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:34,648
Really?
- I get paid more ...

175
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,542
and I can spend more time with Maria
and my three kids.

176
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:42,504
Did you have three children?

177
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,230
Do not say ...
- The detective on duty.

178
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:49,092
Number three.
I am very happy with it.

179
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,000
That is great news.
Congratulations.

180
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:58,214
But an office job with the FBI,
terrible news. You can not take that job.

181
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:04,483
Tommy, I love you very much.
- Of course I love you too.

182
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:07,006
But I'd rather take advice
a ham sandwich.

183
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,713
Now you insult me ??really.
Let me explain something to you.

184
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,707
You play the game,
the game plays you.

185
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,137
I am determined.
It's happening.

186
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:20,053
This is what you obviously already discussed with Mary?

187
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:26,628
I knew it.
After you have discussed it with Mary ...

188
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,870
then you decided.

189
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:44,154
Thank you.
- How are you?

190
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,322
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, boss.

191
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,362
You're early.

192
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:52,334
I had a prayer breakfast
the Baptist church ...

193
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:55,375
Lafayette Park.
It is a help for needy program.

194
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:58,574
You act on this?

195
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,135
Course.

196
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:05,076
Crime in this neighborhood ...
You do not want and it's bad for business.

197
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,592
Solve it.

198
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:12,218
He runs away.
- Absolutely.

199
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,699
That's what me here.

200
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,557
You want to know what Gandalf
and I have to say?

201
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:24,105
You're the magician.
What should I say.

202
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,734
We have another one, right?

203
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,785
Is this some kind of gang war?

204
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:34,008
Here at least
required for two or three.

205
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:37,187
No.

206
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:44,292
This is a guy.
- A guy who killed all three of them?

207
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:48,461
A.

208
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:53,102
Would you explain that?

209
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,469
What a sick guys.

210
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,173
It's a guy.
- Some guy.

211
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:16,323
I have a driving license.
There is at: Fan Yau Lee ...

212
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:20,056
she has $ 8,000 in cash.

213
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:25,576
The only other object, this elegant
but blank card swap.

214
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:29,883
Prints on the glass. There was
a laptop. That he has taken.

215
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:33,049
Maybe he came for.
- I do not know.

216
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:36,856
I do not think a guy this
all did.

217
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,024
He knew her.

218
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,368
Tied her up,
has had sex with her.

219
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:47,120
Then it goes wrong. She did not scream
else were her bodyguards have come.

220
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:51,294
He drugged her
with a "date rape drug.

221
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,290
We do a blood test.
But me get this straight.

222
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,871
How does he get a gun
past the guards?

223
00:24:56,906 --> 00:25:00,172
They frisked him before
him alone with her.

224
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,959
You would think.

225
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:07,173
That down there have a .380, it seems.

226
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,734
A small pistol, woman model.
This has happened.

227
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,066
There's a guy here and shoot him.

228
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:19,470
Touches the guard twice.

229
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:24,389
If it's a guy,
we are talking about a professional.

230
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:28,593
A true professional, because
Asian man who comes through the door ...

231
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:36,325
he let him squirm, goes to his car
and takes his tools and comes back.

232
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,753
And he shoots him between the eyes.

233
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:46,221
And goes up for the encore.

234
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:23,233
I'm going to ask you a question.
And you get ...

235
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:27,171
nine chances to say the correct answer.

236
00:26:46,513 --> 00:26:48,655
It hurts, does not it?

237
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:56,143
I am fascinated by pain.

238
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,353
But I can make it stop.

239
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:11,633
Tell me what the password
of your laptop.

240
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,735
He had a password.
I understand that.

241
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:18,854
There he not all ten fingers
required.

242
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:21,436
Those other nine were for fun.

243
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,984
So, he's here, cuts her fingers
off and sit here.

244
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:33,309
He draws.

245
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:40,252
Look at this.
A killer thinks he Picasso.

246
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,234
Charcoal.
That takes a while.

247
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:50,354
I leave the lab researching.
Maybe he's a unique type.

248
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:53,351
He does have schooling.
That's pretty good.

249
00:27:53,748 --> 00:27:56,653
Let's find out too.

250
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,321
That is four times our salaries.
- If they did, there's more.

251
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,027
Safe.
- There is a safe.

252
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:27,297
What you got?
- Seems to fingerprint reading.

253
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:34,787
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I always think what you think.

254
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,969
It's your honor.
- No, go ahead.

255
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,848
Do it.
- No.

256
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:48,262
You do it.
- You're the doctor.

257
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:59,975
Here we go.
Jackpot.

258
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:04,184
Slim girl.
She had a backup of its hard disk.

259
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:06,921
Looks like Picasso not always thinking.

260
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:12,292
I would like to you was wrong.
This is very annoying.

261
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,549
Here's the coffee you asked.
- Thank you.

262
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:29,222
I have information about Fan Yau. Not much.
- What you got?

263
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:34,841
28 Years. Taiwanese nationality.
No family here but I still look after.

264
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,854
She goes to the Fudan University
in Shanghai, where she graduates.

265
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,747
Then she won a scholarship to Oxford.

266
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:45,471
But stops after three months.
Then no trace.

267
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:49,889
If you think about the house, the jewels
and the car. That money must come from somewhere.

268
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:55,548
The chances are that there is a boy.
- Are women only as to money?

269
00:29:55,689 --> 00:30:00,512
That is the easiest way for a woman.
It's about a lot of money.

270
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,183
Stick to the matter.
What does the coroner?

271
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,269
It was not death by shock.

272
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:09,499
Her heart just kept on with it.
But this is interesting.

273
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,909
There was a scar from a subcutaneous injection
in her neck.

274
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:14,188
Blood test results are
Of course not.

275
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:19,742
Who are always behind. Let them get along.
That is important. What have you there?

276
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:25,013
The BIOS looks strange

277
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:28,175
In English.

278
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:31,836
We have her email account through.
In her e-mails were two names for.

279
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:36,329
Jao Mercier and Erich Nunemacher.
- Mercier, who has money.

280
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:40,217
Number four on the Fortune 500.
- Here it is.

281
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:46,305
Moutish Corporation. They are here in Detroit.
The Aqua building.

282
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:49,059
As I said, a lot of money.

283
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:54,194
Did you now Erich Nunemacher?

284
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:59,419
Here are a 'E and N'.
He gives us his next target. Come on.

285
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,339
You're coming with us. KLEB, go ahead
and let them know we're coming.

286
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,623
You got it.

287
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:16,591
We come to Erich Nunemacher.
- I'm sorry, detectives ...

288
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:20,565
we said already, without a warrant
go no further.

289
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,137
Tell me what this is about and I
tomorrow it will pass.

290
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:25,189
He's a target.
Tomorrow morning he is dead.

291
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:30,798
A murderer does not go beyond you.
We are all former German agents.

292
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:34,449
This company is our responsibility.

293
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:39,258
The water pressure drops.
Very quickly.

294
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,348
Has that ever happened before?
- No.

295
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:52,239
He has been in the building. Hurry up.
- Follow me.

296
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,467
What is this?
- Mr. Nunemacher your life is in danger.

297
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:42,970
You must leave.
- Nonsense, this building can not income.

298
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:48,919
Tell them. And you, sterilize your hands
before you touch my furniture.

299
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,333
Sir, Fan Yau's killer
perhaps in the building.

300
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:59,133
Go after them himself and throw these people
to the outside.

301
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,293
Guard him.

302
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:16,140
Is there a door to this office
I do not see?

303
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:20,098
Idiot, this whole floor
is my office.

304
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,700
Sit down if you do not want
you shot.

305
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:28,373
Do not touch me. You have dirty hands.
- Sit down.

306
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,774
I'm not an amateur.
- What do you think you're doing?

307
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,201
That door should now open.
Open it.

308
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:14,066
I can not. If it is closed,
can only monitor outside open it.

309
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:15,599
Remember anything else.

310
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:18,941
Then get someone who can make him open.
- Listen, you do not, you idiot?

311
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:22,763
If it is closed, we can do nothing.

312
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:54,835
Let me see your hands.

313
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,058
Let me see your hands.

314
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,681
Put the gun down.

315
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,219
Put the gun down now.

316
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,537
Would you do this when you die?
Put the gun down.

317
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:16,605
Do it now.

318
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:25,164
Put your hands behind your back.

319
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,827
Put your hands behind your back now.

320
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,809
Now do you open that door
or I'll kill you myself.

321
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:03,696
Go out and foster but suicide.

322
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:15,920
Is it?

323
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,833
Look at me.
Is it?

324
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:26,039
I think I killed him.
He is no longer alive.

325
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,527
Is it?

326
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:13,391
You'll see.
You think you know.

327
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,979
The eyes are deeper and the bridge
the nose is stronger. Pronounced.

328
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,498
And he's older.
He crows feet around his eyes.

329
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,336
Ladies and gentlemen, that had worse outcome.

330
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:03,364
Alex, you and your team were close
but that is not enough.

331
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:07,027
I almost had him.

332
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:09,861
There's blood in the bathroom so we have DNA.

333
00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:12,876
What have we got?

334
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:16,266
The charcoal pencils are unbranded
as well as the paper.

335
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,275
They are sold everywhere everyday.

336
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:20,933
The drawing gives us nothing.
- Witnesses?

337
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:24,078
This is Detroit.
No one says anything.

338
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,970
I just talked Nunemacher.
He and Mercier are trapped in the house.

339
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:32,798
With our agents and monitoring of Mercier.
Go ahead along.

340
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:37,914
Mercier who is a good guy.
A Frenchman. Very first name.

341
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:41,733
Has a million fund established to
the new town to life.

342
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:46,561
We have rich French guy
and a professional assassin ...

343
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:49,091
a multinational. What's the connection?

344
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:52,102
Fan Yau, Chief Financial Officer,
Nunemacher, chief general manager ...

345
00:40:52,103 --> 00:40:54,288
He works upward.

346
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:57,770
Perhaps, when Mercier self.
- He does indeed.

347
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,909
We need Mercier morning visit.
- Listen to me.

348
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,001
I have this whole thing under control.

349
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,055
I have things to continue.
And so far ...

350
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,732
did you not tell me anything.
What do we know about the killer?

351
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:16,239
Give my team a chance.

352
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,785
This guy is a killer.
There is no ready profile for him.

353
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,894
Should I tell you what I know?

354
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:32,299
He is an ex-soldier.
Someone. I do not know who.

355
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:39,196
But he feels bad.
Restless looking for a sociopathic narcissist.

356
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:46,527
Trying to hurt someone.
Will someone pay.

357
00:41:46,562 --> 00:41:48,600
Would that he suffers.
I do not know who.

358
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:54,312
Maybe his mother,
his father or himself.

359
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:59,558
The world.
Who knows.

360
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:06,905
We have good look at him,
He also gave us a good look.

361
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:10,046
Is there a chance that we
on his list?

362
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:15,046
No, it will not work.

363
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:21,423
That guy, I'm telling you, he's very focused.
Fan Yau, $ 500,000 dollars in jewelry?

364
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,102
He did not care about. He is focused.

365
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:26,187
He has a clear path.
He goes down the list.

366
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:29,433
He will not depart.
- I'll tell you what.

367
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:34,039
We are dealing with a psychopathic
murderer, with a clear focus.

368
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:38,325
This enables the inhabitants do not hesitate.

369
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,063
This is a beautiful cottage.
- You could say that.

370
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:08,153
Hello. I'm Peramita Megawatti.

371
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:14,215
The assistant to Mr. Mercier.
He expects you so, please ...

372
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:17,615
sit down and I will say that you are there.

373
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:26,023
Can I offer you anything because
we have everything?

374
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:32,345
Would you like something to eat? I can also coffee
worry because I can still use now.

375
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,096
I do nothing.
- Something to eat, coffee?

376
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:37,017
No. We just McDonalds on.

377
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:41,005
That's funny.

378
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,658
That must be strong coffee that they give.
- That was no coffee. Have you seen her eyes?

379
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:51,432
Is she stoned?
- Yeah, she's been up all night.

380
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:56,097
Nobody looks like at eight o'clock in the morning.
- I remember your undercover work.

381
00:43:56,322 --> 00:44:00,545
That was a special occasion.
- Gentlemen. Good to see you.

382
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,801
Under normal conditions.
- I did the same thing to say to you.

383
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:11,379
Detective Ash.
I'm not expecting you.

384
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,890
It was very sexy to be saved
by a beautiful woman.

385
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:21,940
With such a versierzin I had him you must
to murder. I'm kidding.

386
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,538
Thank you, Dr.. Cross.
Leon Mercier.

387
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:41,253
I'm so sorry. My ring.
My only weakness, 14 karat.

388
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,206
I got it from the king of Cambodia.

389
00:44:45,706 --> 00:44:51,625
Thank you all for your courage on behalf of Eric.
He and Cloche are both like family to me.

390
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,696
Working for you is very dangerous
lately apparently.

391
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:58,029
Can I speak with you, Dr.. Cross?

392
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:02,786
<i> Moutish Corporation presents
a new vision for Detroit. </ i>

393
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:04,497
What do you think?

394
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:10,154
Are you like everyone Dr. Cross?
You see only death and destruction?

395
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:13,869
Sir, you want me to question
draw, I'm a cop.

396
00:45:13,926 --> 00:45:15,748
This town is reborn.

397
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:19,462
A global center
for production and innovation.

398
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,584
But this time hydrogenation.
Nanotechnology.

399
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:26,616
Mini reactors the future.

400
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:33,946
Mr. Mercier, you and I both know
your employees are not the goal. You are that.

401
00:45:36,473 --> 00:45:38,305
Any idea why?

402
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:43,388
You have done your homework.
Please sit down.

403
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:55,762
You know, there are many reasons why.
- I understand that. I do not judge.

404
00:45:57,107 --> 00:45:58,853
I'm just looking for clues.

405
00:45:59,192 --> 00:46:01,775
Whoever last night
Fan Yau killed ...

406
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,064
Erich also tried last night to murder.

407
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:08,648
I'm sure I'm his ultimate goal.
- Any idea who it could be?

408
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:15,553
I really have no idea.
But ...

409
00:46:20,504 --> 00:46:22,209
I do not want to die.

410
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,586
Forgive me.
The pressure is enormous.

411
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:38,237
Do you like nature, Dr. Cross?
- Human nature.

412
00:46:46,112 --> 00:46:49,377
Cognac?
- No.

413
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:56,251
Yes you service. But this is Louis XIII.
- Mr. Mercier, we can continue with the case?

414
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:03,502
You'll find it disgusting to
people like me to protect.

415
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:07,260
Someone who is rich and spoiled.
- Go there but not from.

416
00:47:07,883 --> 00:47:09,427
I'm just looking for a villain.

417
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:14,586
You know, if I did not call
, I had called you.

418
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:17,956
Of course you would do. To me one hour
to run and nothing to tell.

419
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,189
No. So with my own
eyes could see ...

420
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,010
or you might be able to handle it
the killer.

421
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:28,203
If I was not fit, would
Erich Nunemacher no longer live, right?

422
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:34,388
No. I think you
a very good detective, you Dr. Cross.

423
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:39,639
Make no mistake. I think you
the man, I hope you are.

424
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:44,684
If I have something else in
shoot let me know.

425
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:49,049
I have another appointment
So excuse me.

426
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:54,627
Cloche please,
accompanies Dr. detective. Cross to his car to.

427
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,362
It is long ago that we together without
the kids are off.

428
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:57,479
And here we are with this bum.
I will not pay for his food today.

429
00:48:57,554 --> 00:48:59,006
I want you to know that he has a job
to look.

430
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:03,769
Like his father, who has two, right?

431
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:09,601
The FBI's profiles, 35 percent
more money. 35 percent.

432
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,840
Good health,
good dental insurance.

433
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:20,254
Normal hours, not as unpredictable as this.
Come on baby, this is good.

434
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:25,600
I get it.
But on the other hand ...

435
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:29,849
I also have a career and that is here in Detroit.
- I know.

436
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:35,491
The children like school. And I
do not know how public education in DC.

437
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:41,068
And how do you explain that your mother
that you leave from Detroit?

438
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,381
With the National Guard and a drink.

439
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:50,429
These are the questions that need answering
before we 'for sale' sign.

440
00:49:50,464 --> 00:49:54,745
I understand, really.
- We have to go through this together.

441
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:57,997
Okay, together.

442
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:00,895
Let them toast, come on.

443
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,447
It's bad luck to water
to toast. We do not.

444
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:09,305
That is superstition, come on.
- Okay, a toast. On the bum.

445
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:13,895
Try not to take.

446
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:16,859
Baby if I could do FBI profiles
I did this probably is not.

447
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:23,225
We're not done yet.
- I know, wait a minute.

448
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:29,695
Monica this may very well be better.

449
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:37,607
Monica?
- This is not Monica.

450
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,064
Do you know who this is?

451
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:45,353
Are you surprised to hear from me?

452
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:49,757
What do you want?
- Your what to send.

453
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:52,598
It now comes your way.

454
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:04,394
There are so many interesting things
you can do with fire, and water.

455
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:09,395
Dr.. Cross, are you there?
Come on.

456
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:14,790
You can do better than that.
This is your only chance for me to analyze.

457
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:20,694
Why do not you give me a few questions?
I want you to ask me a few sets.

458
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:25,512
Did you have fun?
- Come on.

459
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:30,764
Or I have fun?
Yes, I think so.

460
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:36,845
But I think you get my hobby boring.
- So your hobby is inflicting pain?

461
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:41,118
No, that is not just simply a hobby.

462
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:46,988
The infliction of pain is an important
part of my true vocation.

463
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:50,886
So it fascinates you?

464
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,444
In the beginning it was difficult to determine
with the guilt to go.

465
00:51:56,663 --> 00:52:01,481
So where have you started? A pet
of the neighbors? Or was it from yourself?

466
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:08,225
You are disrespectful. Very disrespectful.
And that's not nice. Not at all.

467
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:12,013
I am a professional.

468
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:16,295
We're just two professionals
a conversation, right?

469
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:20,139
Your table is ready.
Would you follow me please?

470
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:27,198
I consider you as a professional.
You're not a professional.

471
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:32,849
Why not?
And last night then?

472
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:39,955
You have my instructions and drawings found.
There you have my appreciation.

473
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:46,315
Monica told me, under duress ...

474
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:51,491
the rest just happen on time.
They may have some pain, right?

475
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:54,754
You're a sick bastard impaired.
Do you?

476
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:57,748
Dr.. Cross, you take it personally.

477
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:02,210
Yes, but as personal as you out of that building
ran with your tail between your legs.

478
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:06,675
I can handle another day to finish.

479
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,707
Failure must be difficult
for a man like you.

480
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:19,688
So how have you punished yourself?
Wire under your nails?

481
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:24,606
Have you getazerd testicles?

482
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:27,239
That's psychology from the handbook, Dr. Cross.

483
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:31,320
Really.
A handbook.

484
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,982
And besides, how can I believe you when you
who wears blue tie?

485
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:47,635
Besides you have a very beautiful woman.
Just sits there ...

486
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:52,259
to decide what they will eat tonight.

487
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,926
She looks great.

488
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:12,653
Honey ...

489
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:19,862
Somebody call 911.

490
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,107
Baby look at me.

491
00:54:25,913 --> 00:54:30,959
No, it's good.

492
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,756
I was wrong, man.

493
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:00,355
I was wrong
and see what happened.

494
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:38,916
Thank you.

495
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,886
What do you Tommy?

496
00:57:43,945 --> 00:57:46,707
It was the lab. They have
traces of the drug ...

497
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:50,983
that bastard used. The
has a 24 hour half-life.

498
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,888
It's called TTX Tatras and something else.

499
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:56,478
That means he's someone
from the neighborhood. Someone knows him.

500
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:58,033
Someone has it in his hands.

501
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:02,945
It paralyzes the victim
and let him fully conscious.

502
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,990
That means she was awake.
She could do nothing but ...

503
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,593
she could feel everything happening to her.
We must find him and off.

504
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:14,045
You need to calm down,
You must stay with me, you ...

505
00:58:14,472 --> 00:58:19,201
You do not understand.
- Please, Tommy. We need to figure this out.

506
00:58:24,782 --> 00:58:30,032
Janelle sits in her room crying.
She is alone.

507
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,804
She needs you, son.

508
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,974
Can I?

509
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:41,919
You can not sit on your own.
We are all worried about you.

510
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:45,244
Nobody goes through this alone.

511
00:59:45,306 --> 00:59:50,803
I want my mommy back, I want her back.
- I know.

512
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:54,187
I want her back.

513
00:59:56,336 --> 00:59:59,539
You know, before you were born ...

514
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:03,051
I had to buy that piano of your mother.

515
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:08,342
I hate the piano, I hate it. I hate everything.
I never play anymore.

516
01:00:14,187 --> 01:00:17,892
Janelle, look at me.

517
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,001
When I was your age ...

518
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:28,882
my father died.
And then my mom and she said ...

519
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:33,354
all things
I'm trying to tell you, honey.

520
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:40,367
But she also said that my father loved me.

521
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:48,462
And I know your mother loved you, baby.
She loved me and your brother.

522
01:00:52,237 --> 01:00:56,412
And if a person is gone,
love is not gone, it stays.

523
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:02,036
Do you understand me?
It remains.

524
01:01:03,195 --> 01:01:07,985
So we continue to love her mind.

525
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:19,706
Thank you baby, big girl.

526
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,862
Good afternoon detective.

527
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:38,776
Call this a bad time?

528
01:01:39,936 --> 01:01:42,282
That depends on whether you me
tell where you are so ...

529
01:01:42,308 --> 01:01:44,870
I can chase like a dog
a rabbit chase.

530
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:49,500
That's all right.
I can feel it.

531
01:01:50,308 --> 01:01:56,182
I mean you looked so stunned by
at the funeral today.

532
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:59,928
But now the pain starts to really flow,
or not?

533
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:05,077
Here is another emotion for you.
That was fun.

534
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:10,620
The pleasure that I will if I have your soul
from your body see oozing, maggot.

535
01:02:10,722 --> 01:02:17,170
Confucius said that if the path
of revenge enters, dig two graves.

536
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:22,088
As long as you're there but in lies.
- I?

537
01:02:22,766 --> 01:02:26,986
Why me?
I mean, you let me do.

538
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:32,878
It's all your fault.
I had you in my sights, fixed.

539
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:39,943
You had so smart.
You had me irritated.

540
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:43,424
All your psychological spouting drivel.

541
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:50,362
I had decided that death too easily
to you. No, you must suffer.

542
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:57,724
Really suffering. Therefore, I
your wife away instead of you.

543
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:05,599
And now you take this knowledge to the grave.
If you just had kept your mouth shut ...

544
01:03:06,812 --> 01:03:09,217
you had no pain.

545
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:35,889
I saw the way
how you and Tommy looked at each other.

546
01:03:36,922 --> 01:03:43,052
I know what you're planning.
I loved her.

547
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:48,431
As if she were my own daughter.
That I do not tell you.

548
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:57,707
Look at yourself sometimes.
Self-appointed, judge, jury and executioner.

549
01:04:11,303 --> 01:04:15,740
Mama, if you step aside or go up the stairs
but you're in my way.

550
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:20,733
You've lost your wife
but you're still here.

551
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:24,596
Your soul is alive in your body.
You can not lose.

552
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:27,453
I lose nothing.
I'm gonna deliver justice.

553
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:31,702
Liar.

554
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:36,654
Try me for the fool.
If you leave, you will be killed.

555
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,751
That's not gonna happen.
- Then grab it, do it.

556
01:04:39,865 --> 01:04:42,198
You go home, is on the following day
and then what?

557
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:47,207
I need to figure out how I another day
can live without Mary.

558
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,211
Do not go away.

559
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:59,199
If you do run away tonight,
how do you then earn income?

560
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:06,695
If your children in the eye,
what will you tell them?

561
01:05:08,115 --> 01:05:11,293
I know what's in your heart,
but you can not do this.

562
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:19,974
He does not stop.
I've seen his face.

563
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:23,106
I heard his voice.

564
01:05:23,925 --> 01:05:27,041
I will always be a threat to
forms him, do not you see?

565
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:33,754
I'd rather meet his soul
the gates of hell, before I ...

566
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:36,858
him a different person from me
lets steal that I love.

567
01:05:42,028 --> 01:05:43,688
Look at me.

568
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,179
These men take you and my children
them to a safe place.

569
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:58,586
Go with them.
And do not fuss.

570
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:46,814
There it is.

571
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:04,646
Alex Cross. How's my girl Pop Pop?

572
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:07,458
Not bad for someone
that your bill.

573
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,699
Now I know how those rumors started.

574
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:14,894
Why do you visit her so much?
- To see if they do not like you is.

575
01:08:14,977 --> 01:08:19,756
Her some hope.
- What are you, Doctor? I have a wide range.

576
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:23,893
Do you want to replace that car which you drive?
Want a flat screen for your two little ones?

577
01:08:23,928 --> 01:08:25,514
Would you kitchen appliances for your mother?

578
01:08:25,546 --> 01:08:28,245
Do not talk about my children,
Not a word, understand?

579
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:31,652
What have you for my wife?

580
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:37,351
I'm sorry.
That was downright cruel.

581
01:08:38,228 --> 01:08:41,049
I hope you do not think
I had something to do with it.

582
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,518
Should you clowns are so close?

583
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:54,989
Maybe you know something
you do not know you know.

584
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:58,071
Everyone says that, Dr. Cross.
- I am looking for a pharmacist.

585
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:02,385
Is your wife injected?
- The killer used a pharmacist.

586
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:06,136
A. And you? You know them all.

587
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:11,146
The guy I'm looking for is a very bad
judgment. He must be crazy for money.

588
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:16,883
He loves exotic stuff. Who is it?
- Why would I help a policeman?

589
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:25,845
I'm not a policeman.
- No, you're a real gangster.

590
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:31,544
Well, this top gangster,
in a real gangster car.

591
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:54,440
Do you know what this is?

592
01:09:56,758 --> 01:09:59,719
A .38 with Pop Pop's fingerprints on it.

593
01:09:59,754 --> 01:10:01,974
I found it when I was her arrested.

594
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,786
You and I both know that they trigger
not persuaded.

595
01:10:05,843 --> 01:10:11,100
So I make you a deal.
Give me the pharmacist and I give you the gun.

596
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:17,971
You are definitely off the track hit.

597
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,207
But you're not crazy.
There was more than one there.

598
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,361
What is this?

599
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:33,858
There's your answer.

600
01:10:38,262 --> 01:10:40,889
If a lawyer to appeal
going, you know what happens?

601
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:43,202
Then the prosecutor what evidentiary problems.

602
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:47,342
Case closed. Give me a name.
- She goes free.

603
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:50,333
Give me a name.

604
01:11:29,506 --> 01:11:32,822
I want to call my lawyer.
- I'm your lawyer.

605
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:41,977
Do you TTX?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

606
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:46,483
The woman he loves is dead and
mine too. Talk to me.

607
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:49,925
Do you TTX?
- What are you talking about?

608
01:11:50,249 --> 01:11:54,201
You have no lawyer but a priest.
For we hold you responsible.

609
01:11:54,236 --> 01:11:56,618
Throw him.

610
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,962
I want a name.

611
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:07,317
I want a name.

612
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:14,191
I know his name.
I do not know who he is.

613
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:18,029
And those security cameras then, eh?
Maybe there was not black?

614
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:23,799
That's him.

615
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,928
Go back.
Slower.

616
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:40,581
Sucks, I'm not wearing my glasses.
- I got it. TD860.

617
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,823
<i> Homicide. </ i>

618
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,509
We have a Cadillac.
- Thomas, David, eight, six, zero.

619
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,294
Thomas, David, eight, six, zero.
- <i> Wait. </ I>

620
01:12:49,317 --> 01:12:51,080
No, listen to me. ANSTAR.

621
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:54,415
Call them, they can of
close distance. Let's go Tommy.

622
01:12:54,647 --> 01:12:56,794
Thanks for your help.

623
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:03,731
ANSTAR says that they can not communicate
with the equipment. He has it disabled.

624
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,855
No, it must be traced.

625
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:09,703
Give him only the sender and receiver
the GPS.

626
01:13:09,704 --> 01:13:11,868
Compare it with the chassis number
then you know where he is.

627
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:16,932
Wait a minute. You need a car chassis number
trace. I will give you the number.

628
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:22,067
0828201141308, yes.

629
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:27,220
Yes, you can send it to my screen.
Perfect, thanks.

630
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,481
It worked, he's in town.
He goes to ...

631
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:36,911
He's headed West Canfield Street.
- In the city, where is that?

632
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:40,786
Please tell me Mercier in town
and that we do not know.

633
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:44,710
Mercier gives a presentation this afternoon
to the city planning commission.

634
01:13:44,997 --> 01:13:48,053
It's about 30 minutes to happen.
The federal courthouse.

635
01:13:48,106 --> 01:13:50,090
Call Brook Well and let him know that ...

636
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,990
millions of baby it is
and are likely to civilian mastery.

637
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:57,564
If he federal courthouse
now shut.

638
01:14:42,121 --> 01:14:43,637
That's far enough.

639
01:14:47,211 --> 01:14:49,831
Close everything.

640
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:09,399
I want to be sure
everyone follow my instructions.

641
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:14,935
Anyone who has the command, she says,
and tell them that they work according to my scenario.

642
01:15:14,986 --> 01:15:17,075
Mine and not theirs. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

643
01:15:17,933 --> 01:15:19,821
The EOD is.
This whole block must have ...

644
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:21,972
15 minutes wiped his.
Ongoing.

645
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:28,410
It's a carpark.

646
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,258
Where do you play tonight, mate?
- Looks very artistically.

647
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:40,172
Do you need groupies or something?

648
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:42,683
Where do you play tonight?
Maybe we.

649
01:15:43,216 --> 01:15:47,640
What do you have in the other pocket, your panties?

650
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,742
Panties husband. We talk to you.

651
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:00,942
That's right, just go away, bitch.

652
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,658
EOD, what do we have?
- It's not safe.

653
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:21,533
We can all these vehicles
impossible within ten minutes check.

654
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:23,821
One of them
can blow up the whole block.

655
01:16:23,941 --> 01:16:26,427
Beautiful. So we're in the middle of Baghdad.

656
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:28,366
Max, I connect the signals.

657
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:33,035
I want you to block the signal. In a radius
of at least 20 blocks in all directions.

658
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:38,277
Close off Madison Avenue.
Lockdown within a radius of one kilometer.

659
01:16:38,312 --> 01:16:42,747
They say he stopped at the corner of ...

660
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:52,178
We lost her.
- EOD, they block all signals.

661
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:54,494
On the side.

662
01:17:12,846 --> 01:17:18,989
What are you doing with the train, man?
- Hey, we're talking to you. Are you deaf?

663
01:17:22,195 --> 01:17:25,460
That's a terrorist, take him out.

664
01:17:27,304 --> 01:17:31,255
No, please, God, no.

665
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:45,760
Please, man. I'm not dead.

666
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:13,358
Alex, I hope you have similar,
otherwise we have an expensive exercise.

667
01:18:13,478 --> 01:18:16,371
Do not worry about politics
and be for once a policeman, please.

668
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:19,189
Do me a favor.
- This is not just a crazy, Will.

669
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:21,260
It does not matter what he is.
Do not you see?

670
01:18:21,299 --> 01:18:23,751
If you look around you see
that everything is shielded.

671
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:27,965
There is no scenario where you
have thought that he had not picked it.

672
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,097
Do not you understand what I'm saying? The only thing here
must be done to stop Mercier ...

673
01:18:32,205 --> 01:18:36,380
20 Blocks are closed.

674
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:40,040
This stops today.
In fact, stop it now.

675
01:18:40,161 --> 01:18:43,455
Just in time for the six o'clock news, right?
- That's great.

676
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:47,745
You are both suspended,
pdf here. Your home.

677
01:18:50,868 --> 01:18:53,417
Frenzy comes just.

678
01:19:33,211 --> 01:19:37,086
Okay, think like him. You have in his head.
Where could he be?

679
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:42,476
Come on. Go into his head. Walk through it.
Where would you sit?

680
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:46,345
I want to personally assure
that it is closed. Completely safe.

681
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:51,002
The train.

682
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:56,174
The train.

683
01:19:58,205 --> 01:20:01,836
Watch out.

684
01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:42,890
Please, I will not tell anyone.

685
01:21:06,959 --> 01:21:08,864
Can you hear me?

686
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:13,693
Where's the car? Go ...
- The car is at Bagley and Grand River.

687
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:16,577
That is the old Michigan Theater.
- This is converted to parking.

688
01:21:16,612 --> 01:21:18,185
That must be his escape.

689
01:22:15,237 --> 01:22:17,604
Talk to me, man.
Is it?

690
01:22:19,386 --> 01:22:21,941
Tell me that all is well with you.
- With me it's good.

691
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:06,421
Remember that we have talked about
two graves, detective?

692
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:10,073
I am above.

693
01:25:27,698 --> 01:25:29,954
You think this is good?

694
01:26:06,909 --> 01:26:09,268
I'm ...

695
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:16,333
enjoy here.

696
01:26:39,442 --> 01:26:44,030
I created you.

697
01:26:58,341 --> 01:27:02,665
Hold on.
I got you.

698
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:08,750
Come on guys, come on.
Hold on, they're coming.

699
01:27:09,082 --> 01:27:11,972
Good.

700
01:27:13,782 --> 01:27:18,555
Hurry up. On three.
One, two, three.

701
01:27:47,674 --> 01:27:49,417
It's over, right?

702
01:27:53,617 --> 01:27:55,245
No.

703
01:27:58,919 --> 01:28:03,380
It's not over, Tommy.

704
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:21,311
Cross here.
- We now come together.

705
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:24,786
Thank you, Chief.
- Wait a minute.

706
01:28:57,813 --> 01:29:01,085
Who is this?
- I think you know that.

707
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:09,076
It looks like I've underestimated you.
Doctor Detective Cross.

708
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:12,972
How did you find me?
- By yours only vanity.

709
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:16,232
Your 14 carat gold ring
the king of Cambodia.

710
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:19,251
You did not get to the courthouse.

711
01:29:19,838 --> 01:29:23,738
But we both knew that you were not.
It was Cloche.

712
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,963
You sent him inside
to attack for you to do.

713
01:29:27,156 --> 01:29:31,705
An attack that you doubt yourself
have settled.

714
01:29:32,096 --> 01:29:36,021
I have the line mapped.
- The transfer is diverted.

715
01:29:36,569 --> 01:29:41,653
You know where to find her.
Everything. Do you understand that?

716
01:29:42,197 --> 01:29:45,213
My financial problems in Germany were
is too large.

717
01:29:46,085 --> 01:29:49,836
Everything is in ruins.
- Yes, 2008 was not a good year for you.

718
01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:55,423
I was forced to do something drastic.
I could not afford to lose.

719
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:57,741
So you darkened the Detroit of your fund?

720
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:03,393
Nunemacher and Fan Yau were involved
to help you escape ...

721
01:30:03,394 --> 01:30:05,131
so you had from them.

722
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:08,299
They had information.
So I had no choice.

723
01:30:09,015 --> 01:30:12,679
And that psycho? Who is he?
- I never knew where he was.

724
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:16,522
I made contact with him on the open market.
He was highly recommended.

725
01:30:16,642 --> 01:30:21,382
You let that monster loose and thought him
could check? You're an arrogant ass.

726
01:30:21,502 --> 01:30:25,505
Your wife never made
part of the issue.

727
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:29,629
I'm really sorry.
- I think you should look out the window.

728
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:35,534
What is this? You have nothing against me.

729
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:39,485
There is no extradition treaty here.
- I do not want extradition.

730
01:30:39,863 --> 01:30:43,652
You're in the perfect place.
- But you have no evidence, no case.

731
01:30:44,224 --> 01:30:49,159
I'm clean.
- That was you, but your assistant Paramita ...

732
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:52,511
is an addict. And I knew
it is only a matter of time ...

733
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,679
before she was caught as they
used or sold or something.

734
01:30:55,812 --> 01:31:00,178
She has overflowed.
If you specified for immunity.

735
01:31:00,298 --> 01:31:05,394
But I have nothing to do with the drugs.
I know nothing since.

736
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:10,190
Why are there two kilos of cocaine,
in the box next to your favorite sofa?

737
01:31:15,767 --> 01:31:20,452
Do you have any idea what the punishment is
for drug smuggling, where you are now?

738
01:31:22,236 --> 01:31:26,722
That is death by firing squad.
- You tricked me.

739
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:33,053
They are lies. All filthy lies.
- My wife is dead because of you.

740
01:31:35,034 --> 01:31:37,078
And you will soon be dead because of me.

741
01:31:41,182 --> 01:31:45,568
I think you underestimate the days of
of people over, Monsieur Mercier.

742
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:51,128
Lies. No, help me. Let me go.

743
01:31:56,284 --> 01:32:03,132
We got him.
- Yeah, we got him pretty good.

744
01:32:07,406 --> 01:32:10,408
If you anticipate here tonight,
how do you then earn income?

745
01:32:10,845 --> 01:32:14,958
If your children in the eye,
what will you tell them?

746
01:32:23,999 --> 01:32:29,870
Well, I guess this is it.
- Yes, I think so.

747
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:36,862
Here, you can save me the stamps.

748
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:42,222
What is this?
- My obligation to the FBI.

749
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:46,110
This looks like a place up.

750
01:32:47,452 --> 01:32:48,980
What do you think?

751
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:56,084
I think you let your shoot
if I'm not there. So watch out.

752
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,613
Very funny.
I was really worried about you.

753
01:32:58,802 --> 01:33:01,991
Like the time I had to intervene before
Charlie McClinch would kick your ass.

754
01:33:02,111 --> 01:33:05,667
And that was the first day in kindergarten.

755
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:09,742
Set the tone for our relationships.
- Do I remind you of the Winston brothers?

756
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:12,919
Two against one, I persisted
and you came to the end up.

757
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,346
I sat behind a tree to enjoy
you was beaten.

758
01:33:24,206 --> 01:33:27,184
Thank you mate.
- No, man, thank you.

759
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:34,985
See you in DC.
- Of course.

760
01:34:04,341 --> 01:34:08,005
The movers are so
and get paid by the hour.

761
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:10,510
You do not ...

762
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:19,872
You do not want to leave you love.
