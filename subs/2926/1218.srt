4
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,394
This is the story of how I died.

5
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:03,038
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.

6
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,587
This is the story of a girl named, Rapunzel.

7
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:10,038
And it starts, with the sun.

8
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:16,509
Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,212
And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.

10
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:26,545
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.

11
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,657
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?

12
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:31,563
You might want to remember her.

13
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,356
She's kind of important.

14
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:39,028
Well, centuries pass and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,389
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.

16
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:46,525
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,

17
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,007
but she got sick,

18
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,805
really, sick.

19
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,246
She was running out of time.

20
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,745
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.

21
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:58,298
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

22
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,867
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.

23
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,179
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,257
this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power

25
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:10,165
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.

26
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:14,246
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.

27
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:22,214
*Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine*

28
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:30,519
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,221
*What once was mine*

30
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,236
All right, you get the jist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?

31
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,499
We've found it!

32
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,609
The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.

33
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,507
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.

34
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,608
With beautiful golden hair.

35
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,246
I'll give you a hint.

36
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,024
That's Rapunzel.

37
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:26,583
To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.

38
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,360
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.

39
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,136
And then that moment ended.

40
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:49,666
*Flower, gleam and glow, let your powers shine*

41
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,948
*Make the clock re...* HUH!

42
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,708
Gothel broke into the castle,

43
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,559
stole the child, and just like that...gone.

44
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,163
The Kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the Princess.

45
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,030
For deep within the forest

46
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,567
In a hidden tower.

47
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,484
Gothel raised the child as her own.

48
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:24,410
*...bring what has been lost, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine.*

49
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,447
Gothel had found her new magic flower.

50
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,790
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.

51
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,606
Why can't I go outside?

52
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,677
The outside world is a dangerous place.

53
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,032
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

54
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:44,043
- You must stay here, where you're safe. Do you understand, flower?
- Yes, Mommy.

55
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,377
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.

56
00:04:55,534 --> 00:05:00,144
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky.

57
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:05,925
In hope that one day, their lost Princess, would return.

58
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,879
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.

59
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:35,479
GOTCHA!

60
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,693
That's twenty two for me.

61
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,318
How about twenty three, out of forty five?

62
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,749
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

63
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,565
Yeah, I don't think so.

64
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,425
I like it in here and so do you.

65
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:58,837
Oh, come on Pascal, it's not so bad in there.

66
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,940

67
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:11,680
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

68
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,924
*7a.m. the usual morning line- up*

69
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,142
*Start on the chores I sweep 'til the floors all clean.*

70
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:23,999
*Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.*

71
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,888
*Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.*

72
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,207
*So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.*

73
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,915
*Ill add a few new paintings to my gallery.*

74
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:42,331
*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook and basically.*

75
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,377
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*

76
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,816
*Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.*

77
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,336
*Papier-mache? a bit of ballet, and chess.*

78
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,550
*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*

79
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:15,874
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch. Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re- read the books.*

80
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:21,531
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*

81
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:26,622
*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair.*

82
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:30,920
*Stuck in the same place I've always been.*

83
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,941
*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...*

84
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:40,199
*Wondering, when will my life begin?*

85
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:49,062
*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*

86
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:58,108
*Just like they do on my birthday, each year.*

87
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:08,454
*What is it like, out there where they glow?*

88
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:17,362
*Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.*

89
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,974
I could get used to a view like this.

90
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,441
- Ryder, come on.
- Hold on.

91
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:52,024
Yep, I'm used to it. Guys I want a castle.

92
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:55,606
We do this job, you could buy your own castle.

93
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,757
Oh, hay fever?

94
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,827
Yeah.

95
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,589
Huh?

96
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,937
Wait, wait. Hey, wait!

97
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:19,210
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?

98
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,295
'Cause I certainly can.

99
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,828
Oh, the things we've seen and it's only eight in the morning.

100
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,484
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

101
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:30,860
This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal.

102
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,779
I'm finally going to do it.

103
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,569
- I'm going to ask her.
- RAPUNZEL!

104
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,034
Let down your hair.

105
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:41,370
It's time.

106
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,912
I know, I know. Come on, don't let her see you.

107
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:52,292
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.

108
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,165
Coming, mother.

109
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:21,355
Hi, welcome home, mother.

110
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:26,108
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do that every single day,

111
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:30,147
without fail, it looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

112
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:32,376
Oh, it's nothing.

113
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,422
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

114
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,431
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

115
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:45,454
All right...so, mother. As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

116
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,571
Rapunzel look in that mirror. You know what I see?

117
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:52,010
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.

118
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,611
Oh look, you're here too.

119
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:58,804
I'm just teasing, stop taking everything so seriously.

120
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,662
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

121
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,724
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

122
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,063
Would you sing for me, dear?

123
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,737
- Then we'll talk.
- OH! Of course, mother.

124
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,008
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine*

125
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,717
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*

126
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,649
*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design*

127
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,580
*Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine*

128
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,615
- Rapunzel!
- So, mother,

129
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,768
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

130
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,003
So I'm just going to tell you. It's my birthday!

131
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,383
TADA!

132
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:35,531
No, no, no can't be.

133
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,980
I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year.

134
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,341
That's the funny thing about birthdays. They're kind of an annual thing.

135
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:47,082
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

136
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,880
And I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday.

137
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,930
Actually what I want for...

138
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,613
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

139
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,650
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

140
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,748
Blah, blah, blah,...blah. It's very annoying.

141
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,293
I'm just teasing, you're adorable I love you so much, darling.

142
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,083
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

143
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,737
- What?
- Oh,...

144
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:19,406
Well I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.

145
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,669
Oh, you mean the stars.

146
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,453
That's the thing

147
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:28,818
I've charted stars and they're always constant.

148
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,770
But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.

149
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,807
Only on my birthday.

150
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,594
And I can't help but feel that they're,

151
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,862
They're meant for me.

152
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:44,592
I need see them, Mother. And not just from my window.

153
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,092
In person.

154
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,972
I have to know what they are.

155
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,214
You want to go outside?

156
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,445
Oh, why Rapunzel.

157
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:56,798
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.

158
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,662
*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*

159
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:05,037
- *You know why we stay up in this tower*
- I know, but...

160
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:09,876
*That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*
*That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*

161
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,698
*Guess I always knew this day was coming.*

162
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,640
*Know that soon you'd want to leave the nest.*

163
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:19,030
- *Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
- But

164
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:25,100
*Trust me pet, Mother, knows best.*

165
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:28,366
*Mother knows best,*

166
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:30,139
*listen to your mother.*

167
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,681
*It's a scary world out there.*

168
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:34,598
*Mother knows best.*

169
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,465
*One way or another, something will go wrong, I swear.*

170
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:42,487
*Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy, quicksand.*

171
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,204
*Cannibals, and snakes, the plague...yes.*

172
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,731
*Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.*

173
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:52,619
*And stop, no more, you'll just upset me.*

174
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,285
*Mother's right here, mother will protect you.*

175
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,927
*Darling here's what I suggest.*

176
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:02,276
*Skip the drama, stay with Mama.*

177
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:07,992
*Mother, knows best.*

178
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,982
*Mother knows best. Take it from your mumsey.*

179
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:15,259
*On your own, you won't survive.*

180
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,938
*Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,*

181
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:21,306
*Please, they'll eat you up, alive.*

182
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:25,181
*Gullible, naive, positively grubby.*
*Gullible, naive, positively grubby.*

183
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:28,120
*Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.*

184
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,158
*Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.*

185
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,978
*I'm just saying, 'Cause I wuv you.*

186
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,926
*Mother understands, Mothers here to help you.*

187
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:42,598
*All I have is one request.*

188
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:50,287
- Rapunzel?
- Yes?

189
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:55,522
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.

190
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,560
Yes, Mother.

191
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:02,722
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

192
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,824
I love you more.

193
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:07,610
I love you most.

194
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,592
Don't forget it.

195
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:14,641
*You'll regret it.*

196
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:16,649
*Motherrrrrrr.*

197
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,069
*Knows best.*

198
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:26,688
Ta, ta, I'll see you in a bit, my flower.

199
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,819
I'll be here.

200
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:59,487
No, no no. This is bad, this is very, very bad, This is really bad.

201
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,962
They just can't get my nose right.

202
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,640
Who cares.

203
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,182
Well it's easy for you to say.

204
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:08,295
You guys look amazing.

205
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:26,486
All right, okay. Give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.

206
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,311
Give us the satchel first.

207
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,895
Wha..? I just...

208
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,735
I can't believe, that after all we've been through together,

209
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,192
you don't trust me.

210
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,386
Ouch.

211
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,145
Now help us up, pretty boy.

212
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:52,058
Sorry, my hands are full.

213
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,184
What?

214
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,057
RYDER!

215
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,508
- Retrieve that satchel with any force.
- Yes, sir!

216
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:24,395
We got him now, Maximus.

217
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,436
Heeyah! Come flea- bag, forward.

218
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:43,844
No.

219
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,354
No, stop it.

220
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,525
Stop it.

221
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:48,101
Give it to me.

222
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,890
Alone at last.

223
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:12,670
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.

224
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,846
I've got a person in my closet.

225
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:20,321
I've got a person in my closet!

226
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:25,604
To weak to handle myself out there, huh Mother?

227
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:30,067
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.

228
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,541
Rapunzel!

229
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:15,452
Let down your hair.

230
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,123
One moment, Mother.

231
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:19,313
I have a big surprise.

232
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,587
Uh, I do too.

233
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,269
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

234
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,737
I seriously doubt it.

235
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:32,673
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

236
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:33,894
Surprise!

237
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,583
Well mother, there's something I want to tell you.

238
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,268
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.

239
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,934
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

240
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:44,729
Okay, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, earlier.

241
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:48,116
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.

242
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,745
Floating lights, and yes I'm leading up to that.

243
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,049
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

244
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,027
No Mother, I'm just saying,

245
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,906
you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.

246
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:01,379
Oh darling, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.

247
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,639
- But if you just...
- Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

248
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,899
- Trust me,...
- Rapunzel.

249
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,288
- ...I know what I'm
- Rapunzel.

250
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,484
- Oh, come on.
- Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

251
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:14,026
You are not leaving this tower, EVER!

252
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:23,504
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

253
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,454
All I was gonna say, mother is that...

254
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:42,758
I know what I want for my birthday, now.

255
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,503
And what is that?

256
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:50,870
New paint. That paint made from the white shells you once brought me.

257
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:53,987
Well that is a very long trip, Rapunzel.

258
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,870
Almost three day's time.

259
00:23:56,092 --> 00:24:00,928
I just thought it was a better idea than, uh, stars.

260
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,787
You sure you'll be all right, on your own?

261
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,139
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.

262
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,834
I'll be back in three days time.

263
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:25,143
I love you very much, dear.

264
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,099
I love you more.

265
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,645
I love you most.

266
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,311
Okay.

267
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Is this...hair?

268
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:44,481
Struggling...struggling is pointless.

269
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,634
I know why you're here.

270
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,358
And I'm not afraid of you.

271
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,871
What?

272
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,445
Who are you, and how did you find me?

273
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,963
Who are you, and how did you find me?

274
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,763
I know not who you are.

275
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,928
Nor how I came to find you.

276
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,869
But may I just say.

277
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,107
Hi!

278
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,753
How you doing?

279
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,259
The name's Flynn Ryder.

280
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,138
How's your day going, huh?

281
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:40,029
Who else knows my location, Flynn Ryder?

282
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,577
- All right, Blondie.
- Rapunzel.

283
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:43,725
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

284
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,519
I was in a situation, Gallivanting through the forest.

285
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,671
I came across your tower and...

286
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:52,034
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

287
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,576
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it.

288
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,160
It's in that pot, isn't it.

289
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:05,783
Huh?

290
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,087
Ahh, will you stop that.

291
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,818
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

292
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,143
So, what do you want, with my hair?

293
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,381
- To cut it?
- What?

294
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,041
- Sell it?
- No!

295
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,960
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair,

296
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,740
is to get out of it. Literally.

297
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,216
Wait, you don't want my hair?

298
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,193
Why on earth would I want your hair?

299
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,679
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.

300
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,695
You're, telling the truth?

301
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,149
Yes.

302
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,730
I know, I need someone to take me.

303
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,118
I think he's telling the truth, too.

304
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,001
Doesn't have fangs, but what choice do I have?

305
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:04,187
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder, I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

306
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,856
- Deal?
- Look this way.

307
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,009
Do you know what these are?

308
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,311
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?

309
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,189
Lanterns...

310
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,330
I knew they weren't stars.

311
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:22,812
Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky,

312
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:26,851
with these lanterns. You will act as my guide,

313
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:30,462
Take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.

314
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:34,741
Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you.

315
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:35,939
That is my deal.

316
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,645
Yeah, no can do.

317
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:43,491
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren't exactly, simpatico,

318
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:45,783
at the moment. So I won't be taking you anywhere.

319
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,991
Something brought you here, Flynn Ryder.

320
00:28:55,992 --> 00:29:00,188
- Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
- A horse.

321
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,792
So I have made the decision to trust you.

322
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,121
A horrible decision, really.

323
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,497
But trust me, when I tell you this.

324
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:12,602
You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick.

325
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:17,015
But without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.

326
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,988
Let me just get this straight.

327
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,876
I take you to see the lanterns.

328
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,176
Bring you back home,

329
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,347
and you'll give me back my satchel?

330
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,605
I promise.

331
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:33,381
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.

332
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,222
EVER!

333
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:43,049
All right, listen, I didn't want to have to want to do this,

334
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,641
but you leave me no choice.

335
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:47,056
Here comes the 'smolder'.

336
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,610
This is kind of an off day for me.

337
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,398
This doesn't normally happen.

338
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,986
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

339
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,487
Really!

340
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,899
- Ooops.
- You broke my 'smolder'.

341
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,703
You coming, Blondie?

342
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,915
*Look at the world so close, and I'm half way to it*

343
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:32,167
*Look at it all, so big do I even dare?*

344
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:37,097
*Look at me, here at last I just have to do it.*

345
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,121
Should I? No.

346
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:41,886
Here I go.

347
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:18,410
*Just smell the grass, the dirt. Just like I dreamed they'd be.*

348
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,624
*Just feel that summer breeze.*

349
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:24,830
*The way it's calling me.*

350
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:32,810
*For like the first time ever, I'm completely free.*

351
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:38,740
*I could go running, and racing, and dancing...

352
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,619
*and chasing, and leaping and bounding.*

353
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,223
*Hair flying, heart pounding and splashing and reeling.*

354
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:48,277
*And finally feeling,*

355
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:58,641
*That's when my life begins.*

356
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:05,667
I can't believe I did this.

357
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,694
I can't believe I did this. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

358
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,950
Mother would be so furious.

359
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:17,944
That's okay, what she doesn't know won't kill her, right?
That's okay, what she doesn't know won't kill her, right?

360
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:20,754
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

361
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:24,093
THIS IS SO FUN!

362
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:27,737
I am a horrible daughter, I'm going back.

363
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,388
I am never going baaaccckkk!

364
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:34,380
I am a despicable human being.

365
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,047
Best day, ever!

366
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,674
You know, I can't help but notice,

367
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,963
you seem a little at war with yourself, here.

368
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,415
- What?
- Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces,

369
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,827
of course, over protective mother, forbidden road trip.

370
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,412
I mean, this is serious stuff.

371
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,327
But let me ease your conscious.

372
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,059
This is part of growing up.

373
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,178
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

374
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,116
That's good, healthy even.

375
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,112
You think?

376
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:15,091
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.

377
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,257
Does your mother deserve it? No.

378
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,758
Will this break her heart and crush her soul?

379
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,760
Of course. But you just got to do it.

380
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,166
Break her heart?

381
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,364
- In half.
- Crush her soul?

382
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,263
Like a grape.

383
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:33,055
She would be heart broken, you're right.

384
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,966
I am, oh my, oh bother.

385
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,565
All right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

386
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:42,212
I'm letting you out of the deal.

387
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,040
- What?
- That's right.

388
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,634
But don't thank me. Let's just turn around,

389
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,386
and get you home, here's your pan and your frog.

390
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,142
I get back my satchel.

391
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:52,246
You get back a mother daughter relationship

392
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,392
based on mutual trust and viola! We part ways as unlikely friends.

393
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,897
- No, I am seeing those lanterns.
- Oh, come on!

394
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:02,775
What is it going to take to get my satchel back?

395
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,851
I will use this.

396
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,258
Is it, ruffians, thugs? Have they come for me?

397
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,188
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

398
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,885
Oh, sorry.

399
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,944
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

400
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,880
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.

401
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:32,334
Yeah, that probably be best.

402
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,317
Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch.

403
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,663
- Where?
- Oh, don't you worry.

404
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,182
You'll know it when you smell it.

405
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,276
Oh, a Palace horse.

406
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,465
Where's your rider?

407
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,550
Rapunzel.

408
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:27,905
RAPUNZEL!

409
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,457
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

410
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:42,918
Rapunzel?

411
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,418
Rapunzel!

412
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,170
RAPUNZEL!

413
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,839
I know it's around here, somewhere.

414
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,516
Ah, there it is.

415
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,438
The Snuggly duckling.

416
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:03,189
Don't worry, very quaint place, perfect for you.

417
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,594
Don't want you scaring, and giving up on this whole endeavor now do we?

418
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:09,996
- Well, I do like duckling.
- YAY!

419
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,270
Garcon, your finest table, please.

420
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,004
You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.

421
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:25,938
Really let that seep in.

422
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,953
What are you getting? Because to me, it's part man smell.

423
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,836
and the other part is really bad man smell.

424
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:33,272
I don't know why, but overall, it just smells like the color brown.

425
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:34,290
Your thoughts?

426
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,964
That's a lot of hair.

427
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,921
She's growing it out, is that blood on your moustache?

428
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:42,517
Goldie, look at this, look at all the blood on his moustache.

429
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:44,978
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.

430
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,838
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

431
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,214
Maybe we should get you home. Call it a day.

432
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,423
Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all.

433
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:56,891
And if you can't handle this place, well maybe you should be back in your tower.

434
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:59,582
Is this you?

435
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:04,575
No, no this is being mean.

436
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,827
Oh, it's him all right.

437
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,036
Gretel, go find some guards.

438
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:12,210
That reward's going to buy me a new hook.

439
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,654
I can use the money.

440
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:15,684
What about me? I'm broke.

441
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:19,608
- Boys, stop!
- We can work this out.

442
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,708
Hey, leave him alone.

443
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:26,109
- Gentlemen, please.
- Give me back my guide, ruffians.

444
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,808
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!

445
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,788
Put him down!

446
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,508
Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

447
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,825
because I've been dreaming about them my entire life.

448
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,527
Find your humanity.

449
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,630
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

450
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:09,035
I, had a dream.

451
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,132
Once.

452
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,297
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*

453
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:23,366
*My sneer could curdle dairy.*

454
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:26,669
*And violence- wise my hands are not the cleanest.*

455
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,310
*But despite my evil look, and my temper and my hook.*

456
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,819
*I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.*

457
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,570
*Can't cha see me on the stage performing Mozart.*

458
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:42,203
*Tickling the ivories, 'til they gleam.*

459
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,471
*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*

460
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:47,473
*For my killer show- tune medley. Thank you.*

461
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:51,210
*'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream.*

462
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,553
*He's got a dream, he's got a dream.*

463
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:58,060
*See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem.*

464
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,694
*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*

465
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,781
*You can count me with the dreamers.*

466
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,421
*Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.*

467
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,980
*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*

468
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:15,195
*Plus something here that oozes.*

469
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:17,873
*Let's not even mention my complexion.*

470
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,025
*But despite my extra toes.*

471
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,931
*And my goiter and my nose.*

472
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:25,034
*I really want to make a love connection.*

473
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:29,063
*Can't you see me with a special little lady.*

474
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:32,326
*Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.*

475
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:34,366
*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*

476
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,403
*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*

477
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:39,457
*'Cause way down deep inside, I gotta dream.*

478
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:43,124
*I gotta dream, I gotta dream.*

479
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,601
*And I know one day will never reign supreme.*

480
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:48,789
*Though my face leaves people screaming.*

481
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,899
*There's a child behind it dreaming.*

482
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,611
*Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.*

483
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:57,188
*Tor would like to quit and be a florist.*

484
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:01,190
*Gunther does interior design.*

485
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:05,102
*Ulf is into mime, Attila's cupcakes are sublime.*
*Ulf is into mime, Attila's cupcakes are sublime.*

486
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:06,927
*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*

487
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:08,902
*Fang does little puppet shows.*

488
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:14,430
*And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns.*

489
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,964
What about you?

490
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,299
- I'm sorry, me?
- What's your dream?

491
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,664
No, no, no. Sorry boys, I don't sing.

492
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:25,697
*I have dreams like you, no really.*

493
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:27,284
*Just much less, touchy- feely.*

494
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:30,196
*They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny.*

495
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:34,338
*On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone.*

496
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:38,238
*Surrounded by enormous piles of money.*

497
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:41,937
*- I've got a dream...I've got a dream. - She's got a dream.*

498
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:45,452
*I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam.*

499
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:47,886
*And with every passing hour.*

500
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:49,563
*I'm so glad I left my tower.*

501
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:52,458
*Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream.*

502
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:56,542
*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream. They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*

503
00:41:56,543 --> 00:42:04,549
*So our differences ain't really that extreme. We're one big team.*

504
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,411
*Call us brutal, say sadistic and grotesquely optimistic.

505
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:11,345
*'Cause way down deep inside, we've gotta dream.*

506
00:42:11,346 --> 00:42:13,659
*We gotta dream, I gotta dream.*

507
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:20,978
*Yes way down deep inside I've got a...*

508
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:27,037
*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*

509
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,681
I found the guards.

510
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:36,751
Where's Ryder, where is he?

511
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:38,909
I know he's in here somewhere.

512
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:42,024
Find him, turn the place upside down if you have to!

513
00:42:58,023 --> 00:43:00,817
Go, live your dream.

514
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:02,162
I will.

515
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,706
Your dream stinks, I was talking to her.

516
00:43:06,906 --> 00:43:08,391
Thanks for everything.

517
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:15,119
I believe this is the man you're looking for.

518
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,937
You got me.

519
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,407
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

520
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:24,933
Maximus.

521
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,799
What's he doing?

522
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:46,581
A passage, come on men, let's go.

523
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,634
Corman, make sure those boys don't get away.

524
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:55,573
Play it safe.

525
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:59,296
We'll go get the crown.

526
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:10,882
I gotta dream, I got some dream.

527
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,851
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

528
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:20,082
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.

529
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:24,170
Oh stop it, you big lug.

530
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,649
Where does that tunnel lead out?

531
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,726
Knife!

532
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,624
Well, that got us safe.

533
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,964
Didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty, impressive.

534
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,307
I KNOW!

535
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:40,083
I know...

536
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,327
Sooo, Flynn.

537
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,528
Where are you from?

538
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,714
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie, I don't do back story.

539
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:51,611
However I am becoming very interested in yours.

540
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:54,087
Now I...I know I'm not suppose to mention the hair.

541
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,901
- Nope.
- Or, the Mother.

542
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,745
- Uh, uh.
- Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.

543
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:00,102
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

544
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:04,056
Here's my question though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly,

545
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:06,414
why haven't you gone before?

546
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:16,787
Uh, Flynn...

547
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,675
Flynn!

548
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,632
Run, RUN!

549
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:42,171
Who's that?

550
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,375
They don't like me.

551
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,804
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

552
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:49,107
- Who's that?
- Lets just assume for the moment,

553
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,624
that everyone here doesn't like me.

554
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,124
Here.

555
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:03,393
I've waited a long time for this.

556
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:16,243
Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these.

557
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:29,207
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done.

558
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,643
How 'bout two out of three?

559
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,026
Flynn!

560
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:44,427
Flynn, look out.

561
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,765
- Whoa, WHOAAA!
- Hold on.

562
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:52,311
You should see your faces. Because you look...

563
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:54,000
Ridiculous

564
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:02,572
Come on, Blondie.

565
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:03,866
Jump.

566
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:36,452
It's no use, I can't see anything.

567
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,167
Hey, there's no point.

568
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,011
It's pitch black down there.

569
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,240
This is all my fault.

570
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:59,027
She was right, I never should have done this.

571
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:04,837
I'm so...

572
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,128
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

573
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,346
Eugene.

574
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,669
What?

575
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:22,500
My real name is, Eugene Fitzherbert.

576
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:26,075
So you might as well know.

577
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:32,532
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.

578
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:33,593
What?

579
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:39,896
I have magic hair, that glows when I sing.

580
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:44,249
*Flower gleam and glow. Let your power shine.*

581
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:35,413
We made it.

582
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:37,277
Her hair glows.

583
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,002
We're alive. I'm alive!

584
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,834
I didn't see that coming. You're hair actually glows.

585
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,724
- Eugene...
- Why does her hair glow?

586
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:46,043
- Eugene!
- What?

587
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:49,874
It doesn't just glow.

588
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,934
Why is he smiling at me?

589
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:19,629
I'll kill him.

590
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,358
I'll kill that, Ryder.

591
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,851
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

592
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:27,079
And get back the crown, come on.

593
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:29,668
Boys.

594
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:35,750
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails,

595
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,857
and think for a moment.

596
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,258
Oh, please there's no need for that.

597
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:51,540
Well if that's all you desire, then be on your way.

598
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,472
I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns,

599
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:56,485
would have made you rich beyond belief.

600
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:58,483
And that wasn't even the best part.

601
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,070
Oh well, C'est la vie.

602
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,324
Enjoy  your crown.

603
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,565
What's the best part?

604
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:10,918
It comes with revenge on Flynn Ryder.

605
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:22,285
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.

606
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,689
Sorry.

607
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,261
Just don't, don't freak out.

608
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:39,330
*Flower gleam and glow*

609
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:43,750
*Let your powers shine*

610
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:47,749
*Make the clock reverse*

611
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,403
*Bring back what once was mine.*

612
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:56,446
*Heal what has been hurt.*

613
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:00,721
*Change the fates design.*

614
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:04,929
*Save what has been lost.*

615
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,023
*Bring back what once was mine.*

616
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:13,870
*What once was mine.*

617
00:53:27,657 --> 00:53:29,118
- Ah...
- Please don't freak out.

618
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,520
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out, are you freaking out?

619
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:38,984
No, I'm just very interested in your hair. and the magical qualities that it possesses.

620
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,783
How long has it been doing that, exactly?

621
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,575
Forever, I guess.

622
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:49,109
Mother said when I was a baby people tried to cut it.

623
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,504
They wanted to take it for themselves.

624
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:53,811
But, once it's cut.

625
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:56,500
It turns brown, and looses its power.

626
00:53:57,194 --> 00:54:00,837
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

627
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,080
That's why Mother never let me...

628
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:12,027
That's why...I never left the...

629
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,928
You never left that tower.

630
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:21,945
And you're still gonna go back?

631
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,686
No...yes.

632
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:28,433
It's complicated.

633
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:42,318
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

634
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,072
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare you the sob story of

635
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:49,160
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's a little bit of a...

636
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,873
It's a little bit of a downer.

637
00:54:57,146 --> 00:54:58,741
There was this book.

638
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:01,342
A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.

639
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,160
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

640
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:05,960
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive.

641
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:09,943
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing to ever brag about, of course.

642
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,461
Was he a thief too?

643
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:16,099
Ahh, well no.

644
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,645
Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do.

645
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:21,378
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.

646
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:24,568
And...and, for a kid, with nothing.

647
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:26,582
I don't know, I...

648
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:29,065
It just seemed like a better option.

649
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:32,561
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?

650
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,127
It could ruin my whole reputation.

651
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:38,034
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

652
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:40,806
Oh, the thing about a reputation, it's all that a man has.

653
00:55:48,113 --> 00:55:51,126
Um, well I should uh...

654
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,572
I, I should get some more firewood.

655
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:02,605
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Ryder.

656
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:07,394
Well, then you'd be the first.

657
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:09,379
But, thank you.

658
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:21,523
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

659
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:22,822
Mother?

660
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:24,827
Hello, dear.

661
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,943
But I...I..., don't we...

662
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:28,965
How did you find me?

663
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:30,901
Oh, it was easy really.

664
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:35,381
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal, and followed that.

665
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,963
- Mother...
- We're going home, Rapunzel.

666
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:42,390
- Now.
- You...You don't understand.

667
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:44,226
I've been on this incredible journey.

668
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,437
And I've seen and learned so much.

669
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,231
I even met someone.

670
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:51,573
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.

671
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,691
- Come on, Rapunzel.
- Mother, wait.

672
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,231
I think

673
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:58,715
I think he likes me.

674
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:01,334
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented.

675
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,375
- But mother, I...
- This is why you never should have left.

676
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:08,581
Dear this whole romance that you've invented,

677
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:13,355
just proves you're to naive to be here.

678
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:16,633
Why would he like you? Oh come on now, really.

679
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,918
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?

680
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:24,270
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.

681
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,330
*Mother...*

682
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:29,774
- NO!
- No?

683
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:34,658
I see how it is.

684
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,263
*Rapunzel, knows best.*

685
00:57:39,264 --> 00:57:41,098
*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*

686
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,740
*Such a clever grown up, miss.*

687
00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:46,232
*Rapunzel knows best.*

688
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:48,349
*Fine, if you're so sure now.*

689
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,688
*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*

690
00:57:50,689 --> 00:57:51,879
How did you?

691
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,776
*This is why he's here.*

692
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:55,159
*Don't let him deceive you.*

693
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,593
*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.* - I will.

694
00:57:58,594 --> 00:58:02,229
*Trust me my dear, that's how fast he'll leave you.*

695
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:06,083
*I won't say I told you so...no.*

696
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:08,341
*Rapunzel knows best.*

697
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:10,029
*So if he's such a dream boat.*

698
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,898
*Go and put him, to the test.* - Mother, wait.

699
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:19,746
*If he's lying, don't come crying.*

700
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:26,351
*Mother, knows best.*

701
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:34,541
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?

702
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:38,785
Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand?

703
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:41,733
Because I'm not going to lie. That would be stupendous.

704
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,911
Hey, you all right?

705
00:58:45,306 --> 00:58:47,594
Oh, sorry, yes.

706
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:50,827
Just um, lost in thought, I guess.

707
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:55,139
I mean because here's the thing.

708
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,178
Superhuman good looks, I've always had 'em.

709
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:59,970
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

710
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,716
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...

711
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:14,042
Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.

712
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:29,791
Hmm, what?

713
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:35,430
Well I hope you're here to apologize.

714
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:43,504
No, no put me down. Stop it. Let...me...go!

715
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:46,740
- Give me, him.
- OW!

716
00:59:57,733 --> 01:00:00,250
Easy boy, easy, calm down.

717
01:00:02,323 --> 01:00:03,545
Easy boy.

718
01:00:04,402 --> 01:00:05,623
Easy.

719
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:09,085
That's it.

720
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,386
Now sit.

721
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:17,218
- Sit.
- What?

722
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,130
Now drop the boot.

723
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:20,771
Drop it.

724
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,836
Oh, you are such a good boy.

725
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:28,323
Yes you are.

726
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:33,356
You all tired, from chasing the bad man all over the place?

727
01:00:33,357 --> 01:00:34,499
Excuse me?

728
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,397
Nobody appreciates you, do they?

729
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:38,428
Do they?

730
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:41,014
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

731
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:43,517
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

732
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:45,336
Isn't that right?

733
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:47,599
Maximus.

734
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:50,308
You've got to be kidding me.

735
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:55,250
Look, today is kinda the biggest day of my life.

736
01:00:55,828 --> 01:01:00,290
And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.

737
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:03,004
Just for twenty four hours and then,

738
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,264
you can chase each other to your hearts content.

739
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:06,318
Okay?

740
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,350
And it's also my birthday. Just so you know.

741
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:07,866
Sorry.

742
01:02:30,587 --> 01:02:31,686
Thank you.

743
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:49,832
It's for the lost Princess.

744
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,621
To the boats

745
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:22,154
Hey, Max.

746
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:27,901
What? I brought them.

747
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,953
Most of them.

748
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,706
Where are we going?

749
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,960
Well, best day of your life.

750
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,962
I figured you should have a decent seat.

751
01:04:57,899 --> 01:04:59,494
You okay?

752
01:05:00,632 --> 01:05:02,164
I'm terrified.

753
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,511
Why?

754
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:09,130
I've been looking out the window for eighteen years.

755
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:13,980
Dreaming about what it would feel like when those lights rise in the sky.

756
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:19,177
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?

757
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,167
It will be.

758
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:26,507
And what if it is?

759
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,612
What will I do then?

760
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:31,374
Well that's the good part, I guess.

761
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:34,346
You get to go find a new dream.

762
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:13,596
*All those days Watching from the windows.*

763
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:18,477
*All those years Outside looking in*

764
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:23,604
*All that time Never even knowing*

765
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:30,610
*Just how blind I've been Now I'm here*

766
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:35,540
*Blinking in the starlight Now I'm here*

767
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:40,457
*Suddenly I see Standing here*

768
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:47,571
*It's oh, so clear I'm where I'm meant to be*

769
01:07:47,572 --> 01:07:56,811
*And at last, I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted*

770
01:07:56,812 --> 01:08:05,783
*And at last, I see the light And it's like the sky is new*

771
01:08:05,784 --> 01:08:15,784
*And it's warm and real and bright And the world has somehow shifted*

772
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:24,074
*All at once Everything looks different*

773
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:28,966
*Now that I see you*

774
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,533
I have something for you, too.

775
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:40,799
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.

776
01:08:40,963 --> 01:08:44,735
And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore.

777
01:08:44,736 --> 01:08:46,203
You know what I mean?

778
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:49,054
I'm starting to.

779
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:58,456
*All those days Chasing down a daydream*

780
01:08:58,457 --> 01:09:02,823
*All those years Living in a blur*

781
01:09:02,824 --> 01:09:07,989
*All that time Never truly seeing*

782
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:14,778
*Things, the way they were Now she's here*

783
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:19,586
*Shining in the starlight Now she's here*

784
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:24,150
*Suddenly I know If she's here*

785
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:31,148
*It's crystal clear I'm where I'm meant to go*

786
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:35,596
*And at last, I see the light*

787
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:39,590
*And it's like the fog has lifted*

788
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:44,162
*And at last, I see the light*

789
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:48,406
*And it's like the sky is new*

790
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:59,386
*And it's warm and real and bright And the world has somehow shifted*

791
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:06,859
*All at once Everything is different*

792
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,449
*Now that I, see you.*

793
01:10:16,014 --> 01:10:25,905
*Now that I...see you.*

794
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:44,878
Is everything okay?

795
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,788
Huh? Oh yes.

796
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:49,994
Uh, yes of course.

797
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,013
I just...

798
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:59,294
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

799
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:01,904
There's just something I have to take care of.

800
01:11:04,977 --> 01:11:06,591
Okay.

801
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:09,883
I'll be right back.

802
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:17,776
It's all right, Pascal.

803
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:27,135
Ahh, there you are.

804
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:30,306
I've been searching everywhere for you guys. Since we got separated.

805
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:32,806
Hey the sideburns are coming in nice, huh?

806
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:34,374
You gotta be excited about that.

807
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:39,708
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

808
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:42,569
I shouldn't have split. The crown is all yours.

809
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:46,781
I'll miss you, but I think its for the... best.

810
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:51,439
Holding out on us again? Hey, Ryder?

811
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:54,697
- What?
- We heard you found something.

812
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:57,843
Something much more valuable than a crown.

813
01:11:58,323 --> 01:12:01,642
We want her, instead.

814
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:15,304
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.

815
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:23,427
He did.

816
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:26,413
What? No.

817
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:27,437
He wouldn't.

818
01:12:28,204 --> 01:12:30,079
See for yourself.

819
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:35,915
Eugene?

820
01:12:38,502 --> 01:12:39,881
Eugene!

821
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,128
Fair trade.

822
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:47,760
A crown, for the girl with the magic hair.

823
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:52,724
How much do you think someone will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

824
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:54,569
No, please.

825
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,893
NO!

826
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,261
NO!

827
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:06,942
Rapunzel!

828
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,444
Mother?

829
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:17,096
Oh, my precious girl.

830
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:18,787
Mother.

831
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:20,943
Are you all right?

832
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:22,274
Are you hurt?

833
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:25,742
- Mother, how did you?
- I was so worried about you dear.

834
01:13:25,743 --> 01:13:27,154
So I followed you.

835
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:29,019
And I saw them attack you.

836
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,843
All right, let's go, let's go before they come to.

837
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:03,630
You were right, mother.

838
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:06,277
You were right about everything.

839
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:08,949
I know darling.

840
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:11,535
I know.

841
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:25,589
Look!

842
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:27,572
The crown.

843
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:29,517
Rapunzel.

844
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:31,575
RAPUNZEL!

845
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:36,114
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, guys.

846
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:40,947
Rapunzel!

847
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:02,521
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

848
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,874
Where are we going?

849
01:15:13,812 --> 01:15:16,396
There, it never happened.

850
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,997
Now, wash up for dinner.

851
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:23,700
I'm making hazel nut soup.

852
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,207
I really did try, Rapunzel.

853
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,437
I tried to warn you, what was out there.

854
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:37,359
The world is dark, and selfish,

855
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,598
and cruel.

856
01:15:38,598 --> 01:15:41,818
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.

857
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:44,750
It destroys it.

858
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:28,482
How did you know about her?

859
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:29,633
Tell me, now!

860
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:30,884
It wasn't us.

861
01:17:30,884 --> 01:17:32,355
It was the old lady.

862
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,985
Old lady?

863
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,478
Wait, no, wait!

864
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:39,312
You don't understand, she's in trouble.

865
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:40,272
Wait!

866
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:41,546
Rapunzel?

867
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,367
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

868
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,133
Are you all right?

869
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:54,074
I'm the lost princess.

870
01:17:54,556 --> 01:17:58,179
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel. You know how I hate the mumbling.

871
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,065
I am the lost Princess.

872
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:02,106
Aren't I?

873
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,787
Did I mumble, Mother?

874
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:10,730
Or should I even call you that?

875
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:15,248
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

876
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,846
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?

877
01:18:17,847 --> 01:18:21,054
It was you! It was all, you.

878
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:26,933
Everything I did, was to protect you.

879
01:18:28,529 --> 01:18:31,696
- Rapunzel.
- I spent my entire life,

880
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:34,670
Hiding from people who would use me for my power.

881
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:37,151
- Rapunzel!
- And I should have been hiding.

882
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:38,195
From you.

883
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:39,407
Where will you go?

884
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:41,394
He won't be there for you.

885
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:43,221
What did you do to him?

886
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:47,207
That criminal, is to be hanged for his crimes.

887
01:18:47,324 --> 01:18:50,916
- No.
- Now, now. It's all right.

888
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:51,978
Listen to me.

889
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,471
All of this is as it should be.

890
01:18:55,472 --> 01:18:56,578
NO!

891
01:18:57,295 --> 01:18:59,903
You were wrong about the world.

892
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,149
And you were wrong about me.

893
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,655
And I will never let you use my hair, again!

894
01:19:16,032 --> 01:19:17,681
You want me to be the bad guy?

895
01:19:17,682 --> 01:19:19,578
Fine.

896
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:22,103
Now I'm the bad, guy.

897
01:19:36,196 --> 01:19:37,528
What's this?

898
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:39,408
Open up.

899
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:42,219
What's the password?

900
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,984
- What?
- Nope.

901
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:45,617
Open this door.

902
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:47,522
Not even close.

903
01:19:47,523 --> 01:19:48,722
You have three seconds

904
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:50,111
One...

905
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:52,346
Two...

906
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:55,457
Three...

907
01:20:00,423 --> 01:20:03,139
Frying pans. Who knew, right?

908
01:20:32,705 --> 01:20:34,008
- Head down?
- Head down.

909
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:35,118
- Arms in?
- Arms in.

910
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:36,193
- Knees apart?
- Knees apart.

911
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:37,177
Knees apart?

912
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:40,364
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...

913
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,086
Max.

914
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,090
You brought them here?

915
01:20:53,321 --> 01:20:54,480
Thank you.

916
01:20:55,845 --> 01:20:58,528
No really, thank you.

917
01:20:58,528 --> 01:21:04,243
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time we've just misunderstanding one another.

918
01:21:04,244 --> 01:21:07,416
And we're really just, yeah your right. We should go.

919
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:16,194
Max.

920
01:21:16,707 --> 01:21:17,734
Max!

921
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:33,007
Okay Max, lets see how fast you can run.

922
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:53,385
Rapunzel.

923
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:56,866
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

924
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:15,085
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.

925
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:25,945
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

926
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:28,368
Oh don't worry, dear.

927
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:30,727
Our secret will die with him.

928
01:22:32,172 --> 01:22:34,182
And as for us?

929
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:40,288
We are going where no one will ever find you, again.

930
01:22:46,764 --> 01:22:50,266
Rapunzel, really. Enough all ready.

931
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:52,764
Stop fighting me.

932
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:55,176
NO! I won't stop.

933
01:22:55,177 --> 01:22:58,849
For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight.

934
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,667
I will never stop trying to get away from you.

935
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:07,577
But, if you let me save him...

936
01:23:07,578 --> 01:23:09,278
I will go with you.

937
01:23:09,964 --> 01:23:13,247
No. No, Rapunzel.

938
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:17,164
I'll never run, I'll never try to escape.

939
01:23:17,165 --> 01:23:20,965
Just let me heal him. And you and I will be together.

940
01:23:20,966 --> 01:23:22,770
Forever, just like you want.

941
01:23:22,771 --> 01:23:25,004
Everything will be the way it was.

942
01:23:26,052 --> 01:23:28,047
I promise.

943
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:30,169
Just like you want.

944
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:36,506
Just...let me...heal him.

945
01:23:42,357 --> 01:23:45,967
In case you get any ideas about following us.

946
01:23:47,016 --> 01:23:48,907
Eu..Eugene!

947
01:23:54,127 --> 01:23:56,822
Oh, I'm so sorry.

948
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,351
- Everything is going to okay, though.
- No, Rapunzel!

949
01:23:59,352 --> 01:24:01,756
- I promise, you have to trust me.
- No..

950
01:24:01,757 --> 01:24:04,522
- Come on.
- I can't let you do this.

951
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:07,132
And I can't let you die.

952
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:09,844
- But if you do this.
- Shhh.

953
01:24:09,846 --> 01:24:11,981
- Then you...will die.
- Hey.

954
01:24:13,262 --> 01:24:15,019
It's gonna be all right.

955
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:23,340
Rapunzel, wait...

956
01:24:32,598 --> 01:24:34,600
Eugene, what...?

957
01:24:34,677 --> 01:24:36,307
NOOO!

958
01:24:41,121 --> 01:24:44,029
No...NO!

959
01:24:44,491 --> 01:24:48,447
What have you done? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

960
01:24:54,835 --> 01:24:57,906
No, no, no, NOOO!

961
01:24:58,446 --> 01:25:02,178
No, no, no, noooo.

962
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:05,107
NO!

963
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:08,123
Noooooooooo!

964
01:25:26,346 --> 01:25:28,852
No, no, no, no, Eugene.

965
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:34,040
Oh, look at me, look me, I'm right here.

966
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,146
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.

967
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:39,519
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your powers shine*

968
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,310
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*

969
01:25:43,311 --> 01:25:45,695
- Rapunzel...
- What?

970
01:25:48,382 --> 01:25:50,426
You were my new dream.

971
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:55,669
And you were mine.

972
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:25,826
*Heal what has been hurt.*

973
01:26:26,706 --> 01:26:30,982
*Change the fates design.*

974
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,086
*Save what has been lost.*

975
01:26:37,646 --> 01:26:40,631
*Bring back what once was mine.*

976
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,126
What once was mine.

977
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,245
Rapunzel?

978
01:27:45,603 --> 01:27:46,783
Eugene.

979
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:51,974
Did I ever tell you, I've got a thing for brunettes?

980
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:38,935
Well, you could imagine what happened next.

981
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:42,493
The kingdom rejoiced.

982
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:44,305
For the lost Princess had returned.

983
01:29:44,306 --> 01:29:46,463
The party lasted an entire week.

984
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,079
And, honestly I don't remember much of it.

985
01:29:50,004 --> 01:29:51,708
Dreams came true all over the place.

986
01:29:51,709 --> 01:29:55,923
That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it.

987
01:29:58,502 --> 01:30:01,134
And this guy? Well he eventually found true love.

988
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:05,208
As for this guy, well, I assume he's happy.

989
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,720
He's never told me otherwise.

990
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:13,195
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost over night.

991
01:30:14,811 --> 01:30:16,660
As did most of the apples.

992
01:30:18,817 --> 01:30:21,836
Pascal? Never changed.

993
01:30:25,576 --> 01:30:27,957
At last Rapunzel was home,

994
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:29,651
and she finally had a real family.

995
01:30:31,308 --> 01:30:33,456
She was a Princess worth waiting for.

996
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:35,857
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom

997
01:30:35,858 --> 01:30:39,198
with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.

998
01:30:40,078 --> 01:30:41,963
And as for me, well.

999
01:30:41,964 --> 01:30:43,542
I started going by Eugene again.

1000
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:45,686
Stopped thieving, and basically turned it all around.

1001
01:30:45,687 --> 01:30:47,427
But I know what the big question is.

1002
01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:50,084
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

1003
01:30:50,717 --> 01:30:51,750
Well I'm pleased to tell you.

1004
01:30:51,753 --> 01:30:54,517
That after years, and years of asking,

1005
01:30:54,518 --> 01:30:56,518
and asking, and asking.

1006
01:30:58,215 --> 01:31:00,139
I finally said yes.

1007
01:31:00,352 --> 01:31:01,903
*Eugene*

1008
01:31:01,905 --> 01:31:04,685
All right, I asked her.

1009
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:06,758
And we're living happily ever after.

1010
01:31:08,025 --> 01:31:09,428
Yes, we are.

1011
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:44,469
