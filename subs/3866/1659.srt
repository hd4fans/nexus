1
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:15,847
我已经活了那么多年
I have lived through many ages ...

2
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:19,578
我变成过鲑鱼
through the eyes of salmon,

3
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,541
鹿
deer,

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,072
还有狼
and wolf.

5
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:32,259
我看到了北方人侵略爱尔兰 寻找黄金
I have seen the North Men invading Ireland\ndestroying homes, in search gold.

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,050
我看到了黑暗中的煎熬和苦难
I have seen suffering in the darkness,

7
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:58,782
然而 我在最脆弱的地方\n看到了美丽的希望
yet ... I have seen beauty\nthrive in the most fragile of places.

8
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,827
我看到了那本书\n那本将黑暗变为光明的书
I have seen the book ... the book\nthat turned darkness into light.

9
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:12,066
片名：凯尔斯的秘密
The Secret of Kells 2009

10
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:31,227
布兰登！别让它跑了！
Brendan? Don't let her get away!

11
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:42,322
来吧 漂亮的小鹅鹅
Come on! Nice goosy, goosy, goosy ...

12
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:51,421
靠后点 我来搞定
Stand back, I will get her!

13
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:07,354
哪边？
Which way?

14
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:23,822
布兰登 那个支架还不牢固
Brendan! That scaffolding is not steady!

15
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:26,962
别担心 阿索尔修士 我会小心的
Don't worry, brother Assoua, I'll be careful.

16
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,650
不好意思
Sorry.

17
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,300
布兰登！
Brendan!

18
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,307
来了
Coming!

19
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,139
布兰登！
Brendan!

20
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,433
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?

21
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:41,073
让它安静点 布兰登\n否则修道院长会听到的
Keep it quiet, Brendan!\nOr the abbot will hear.

22
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:45,635
我很抱歉 但是我必须要这么做\n很快就会完事的
I'm sorry, but we have to do this.\nIt will all be over in a minute.

23
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,862
1…2…3…4…5\nOne…Two…Three…Four…Five

24
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,982
也不是很疼 对吧
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

25
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,925
幸运的小鸟
Lucky bird.

26
00:04:55,961 --> 00:05:02,218
你的羽毛将成为\n我们书写那些不朽篇章的工具
Your feathers will become the tools\nfrom which we create immortal pages\nof sacred text.

27
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,608
院长 请听我解释
Abbot! I explain for you ...

28
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,755
我们想抓住这只鹅 但是它跑的太快了
We tried to catch goose ... \nand she run very fast.

29
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,822
我跌到了泥里
And I fall in the mud ...

30
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,386
原谅我们吧 院长
Forgive us, abbot.

31
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,015
布兰登 我要的设计图在哪？
Brendan! Where are those\nplans I asked for?

32
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,993
设计图？我忘在书房了
The plans ... I left them in the\nscriptorium.

33
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,510
- 把它们拿到塔楼来\n- 是的 叔叔
- Bring them to the tower\n- Yes uncle.

34
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:44,921
明天你们回去继续修建城墙\n从早干到晚
Tomorrow, you will go back to work on the wall.\nDawn t'll evening bell.

35
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,185
然后你 里昂纳多修士
and brother Leonardo ...

36
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:51,164
回去清洗一下 可怜人
... clean yourself up for pity's sake.

37
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:03,071
我不知道为什么我们艺术家也要被征用\n他就只关心那墙吗？
I do not know why there are at it this intense\nwhen all that man wants us to do is to build his crazy wall.

38
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:08,508
没错 其他事他都不关心\n不过你却一直在替他辩护 布兰登
Yes, that's all the man cares about, nothing else,\nand you continue to defend him, Brendan!

39
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,414
叔叔只是想抵挡外面的侵略
Uncle just wants to protect us from outside.

40
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:16,770
北方的维京人来入侵的时候\n他们不管老少 所以
When the North Men come to Kells, they'll make no distinction\nbetween young and old. So ...

41
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,060
做好准备或者准备受死吧
"Prepare or meet your doom!"

42
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,028
你们就是不明白…
You just don't understand ...

43
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:30,879
但是布兰登 你从来没有到这墙外去过
But Brendan, you've never been outside these walls.

44
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:34,168
但是我不用出去也知道外面有多危险
I don't have to go outside to know how dangerous it is.

45
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,279
- 你去哪了？\n- 去弄这个了 给你的
- Where have you all been?\n- We went to get these, for you.

46
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:41,239
你真应该看看谢尔盖修士
You should have seen brother Sergey,

47
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,322
它的羽毛一伸展开\n就像一只美丽的天鹅
he took a flying dive,\nlike a beautiful swan.

48
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:46,692
这一点也不好笑
It is not funny.

49
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:51,309
修道院长看到我们了 他不开心\n因为我们没有在墙上干活
The abbot has seen us, he is not happy\nbecause we are not work on the wall.

50
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:56,559
够了 那书呢？没人看重它们吗？
Now enough of that! What about the books?\nDoes he not find them?

51
00:06:56,595 --> 00:07:01,772
如果没有书\n所有的知识都会流逝 永远的流逝
If there were no books, all knowledge\nwould be lost ... for ethernity.

52
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,874
我们不能永远指望建造城墙！
We cannot only build walls.

53
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:07,157
人们需要读书 这样才有希望
The people must have books,\nso that they may have hope.

54
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,451
如果我们有本真正绘经大师的书 \n那对我们的工作会有很大帮助
If we had a true master illuminator\nwould would do so much splendid work!

55
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:13,709
让我们祈祷上帝有一天会给我们带来
Let us pray that one will be delivered to us\none day.

56
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:14,906
对 我们一起祈祷
Let us Pray!

57
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:19,449
你当然不需要一个大师\n你们的作品是我见过最漂亮的了
Surely you don't need a master,\nyour work is the finest I've seen ...

58
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,925
谢谢你 布兰登\n但是我们离真正的大师还是有差距的
Thanks Brendan, but\nwe are mere scriblers...

59
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:26,809
真正的大师？比方说？
- next to true masters.\n- True masters? Such as ...

60
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:31,244
比方说 艾奥纳的伊丹修士
Brother Aidan of Iona.

61
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,347
伊丹的确是很棒的
He is indeed the great one.

62
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:35,415
伊丹修士是谁啊？
Who is the brother Aidan?

63
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,776
一个很有智慧的人
A sage.

64
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,974
最有智慧的人
The wisest one of them all.

65
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,134
最完美的绘经师
The perfect Illuminator.

66
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,258
那伊丹在哪？
Well where is he then?

67
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,150
他住在一个叫艾奥纳的小岛上
He lives on a tiny island called Iona.

68
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:52,308
那里有一座寺庙 他在那里\n绘制一部了不起的书 艾奥纳之书
There is an abbey on the island, where he works\non a magnificent book: The Book of Iona.

69
00:07:53,629 --> 00:08:01,971
那本书是200年前 由圣人科伦巴努写的
The book was begon 200 years ago, under the\norders of none other than Saint Columb Kil himself.

70
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,549
艾奥纳之书远远超过其他的书籍
The Book of Iona outshines\nall others

71
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,943
因为科伦巴努第三只眼睛创造的奇迹
because of the miracle of \nColumb Kil's third eye

72
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,690
不是因为他的第三只眼睛\n是因为他有三只长了十二个指头的手
No, not because of his third eye, because of his\nthree hands with 12 fingers on each.

73
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:17,783
不不不 他有三只眼睛 不是三只手
That's not true! He had a third eye,\nnot a third hand!

74
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:20,157
你没听说过他的科伦巴努之眼吗？
Have you not heard of the eye\nof Columb Kil ?

75
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:23,864
我当然听过\n但那第三只眼睛是用来预测未来的
Ofcourse! But that was for \nmaking the prophecies

76
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,535
是他的第三只手开始写的这本书
His third hand was \nfor beginning the book.

77
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:31,978
够了！跟我说说关于伊丹修士的事
Enough! Just tell us about\nBrother Aidan.

78
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:36,420
他在绘经 然后书上发出了光芒\n然后他就消失了
His writings are said to glow from the pages,\nas though they are light.

79
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:40,685
有罪的人看了书页 眼睛就瞎掉了
Sinners have been blinded\nwhile glansing upon the pages.

80
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,010
书页上的语言看起来像天堂自身
For to gaze upon the book, is to gaze\nupon the heavons itself!

81
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,211
艾奥纳之书
The Book of Iona.

82
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,167
但是艾奥纳在哪呢？
But where is Iona?

83
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:54,737
在很遥远的海上\n像所有其他的小岛一样
It is far far away in the sea. Like all\nislands should be.

84
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,207
一个世外桃源
A beautiful place

85
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:00,270
一个绘经师不用住在城墙里的地方
where the illuminators\ndo not have to build walls.

86
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:06,526
但是院长说小岛会很容易遭到攻击
But the abbot sais that\nislands are too easy to attack.

87
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:21,341
布兰登！你怎么还在这里？
Brendan! Are you still here?

88
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:24,794
赶快拿上院长的设计图\n否则你就有麻烦啦
You'd better bring the abbot those plans,\nor you'll be in big trouble!

89
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,838
叔叔！
Uncle!

90
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,512
快点！孩子！
Hurry boy!

91
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,209
我拿来了 叔叔
Here they are uncle.

92
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,425
布兰登！你一再的让我失望\n让我怎么还能相信你的责任心
Brendan! How am I to trust you with responsablity\nwhen you continue to disappoint me?

93
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:47,840
总有一天你会掌管这修道院
One day you will take controle of this Abbey.

94
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:52,034
但今天这么简单的事\n你却你花了几个小时
Yet it takes you several hours to fulfill\na simple task.

95
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,351
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:58,954
修士们在讨论艾奥纳\n我梦到它被摧毁了
The monks were talking about Iona.\nI dreamt it was destroyed.

97
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,300
那个梦好真实 叔叔
It was so real uncle!

98
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,468
那的确是真的 布兰登
It is real Brendan.

99
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:09,183
总有一天 灾难也会降临到这里
One day that horror will come to us.

100
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,864
这正是为什么我们要做好准备
That is exactly why we must prepare\nourselves.

101
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:36,491
这面墙一共有三个支柱\n分别是：这里 这里和这里
This section of the wall is supported by\nthree pillars: here, here and here.

102
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:39,313
叔叔 有人来了
Uncle, someone has arrived!

103
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,068
他有只白猫
He has a white cat!

104
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:44,671
毫无疑问肯定又是一个\n维京人屠杀的受害者
Another victim of the North Men no doubt.

105
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,611
现在 我们来看
Let's see.

106
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,608
怎么会？比非洲还远？
<i> * crowd talking * </i>

107
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:06,137
不不不 没有那么远\n但是我们都是徒步走的
Oh, no, no ... not that far.\nBut we've legs walked ourselves all the way.

108
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:10,026
但是 拜托\n究竟是从哪来的？很远的地方吗？
But please, from where?\nA very long way?

109
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:13,918
不是 也没那么长
Oh yes, it was long enough alright.

110
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,319
有这个小家伙跟着 时间就过得快一倍了
but when you just want to keep up with,\nthe road just takes half the time.

111
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,950
我说的对不？潘戈邦？
Isn't that right Pangur Ban?

112
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,792
欢迎来到凯尔斯 修士
Welcome to Kells, brother.

113
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:26,411
- 卡拉院长！\n- 和平与你同在！
- Abbot Cellach\n- Peace be with you!

114
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:31,800
修士们 请欢迎我们这个时代\n最杰出的绘经师
Brothers,  welcome to Kells\none of the great illuminators of our times.

115
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:34,055
肯定忘了谁了
Must be a mistake.

116
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,273
来自艾奥纳的 伊丹修士
Brother Aidan of Iona.

117
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,606
大家一次问一个问题好吗
One question at a time.

118
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:49,900
就像科伦巴努经常说的\n“问题憋着不烧舌头”
As Columb Kil used to say: "Questions do not burn\nyour tongue if you wait to ask them"

119
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,651
欢迎来到凯尔斯 伊丹修士
Welcome to Kells, brother Aidan!

120
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:55,669
这边走 来吧
Just this way, brother.

121
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,528
你好 欢迎来到凯尔斯
Hello! Welcome to Kells!

122
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,661
等等
Hey, wait!

123
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:14,919
说说你和那本书的事吧
<i> just talking of you and of the book. </I>

124
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,466
真不错的房间 不是吗！
Fine size of a place, isn't it?

125
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,261
新鲜流动的空气 明亮的光线\n真的很不错
Good clean air, bright light coming\nfrom those windows ...

126
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,734
修士！
Brother!

127
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,726
那是你保护书的方法吗？
Is that where you keep the book?

128
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,737
那是你保护书的方法吗？
Is ... that where... you keep... the..

129
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,254
请问你是哪位？\n是个小个子的修士 我看出来了
And who might you be?\nA very short brother I see.

130
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,242
虽然个子小 问题却不小
Although short of stature is never as short\nof questions.

131
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:49,575
但你为什么这么关心书的事呢
And of what interest is the book to you?

132
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:54,926
呃 修士们都在讨论\n他们说圣人科伦巴努…
Well ... the brothers where talking, and they said\nthat Saint Columb Kil himself began s...

133
00:12:54,962 --> 00:13:00,999
修士们 既然伊丹修士来了\n那就让他看看凯尔斯的加强工作
Brothers, the brother of Aidan\nmust come with me.  I must take him to see the important work\nwe are doing to fortify Kells.

134
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:03,564
你还有很多事情要做
You all have work to do.

135
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,523
那份设计图在我的办公室
The plans are in my work room.

136
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:11,959
- 我觉得我可以待在这…\n- 这边走 修士
- Ah see, I was thinking, I could stay here\nand ... -Right this way, brother.

137
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,930
孩子！找点吃的来给…
Lad! Find some food for a...

138
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:20,730
你看 我下决心在两年时间完成这个工作
You see, I am determined to complete the fortifications\nwithin two years.

139
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,493
那么你就是潘戈邦喽 我是布…
So, you're Pangur\nBan. Well I'm Bre ...

140
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,715
喂 等等 我是负责喂你的
Hey! Wait! I'm supposed to feed you

141
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:29,162
等等
Wait!

142
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,987
潘戈邦！
Pangur Ban!

143
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,723
潘戈邦！
Pangur Ban!

144
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,293
你不应该来这 维京人会跟来的
You shouldn't have come here.\nThe North Men will have followed...

145
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,737
那我就站着等死？
"Did I have to stay, to be killed?

146
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:48,005
我跑了很远 把他们甩掉 卡拉修士
I escaped the Vikings and left them far behind.\nBrother Cellach

147
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:51,337
我的意思是 卡拉院长
Sorry, I mean ... abbot Cellach.

148
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:54,829
书很安全 我需要把它完成
The book is saved, and I need to completed.

149
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,888
没错 但我们这里有更重要的要完成
Yes, well ... we have more pressing things \nto complete here.

150
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:04,155
- 你是指你的墙？\n- 不是“我的”墙！
- You mean your wall?\n- Not my wall, Aidan!

151
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:07,386
是保护文明社会的墙
A wall to save civilization.

152
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:09,675
是拯救你那本书的墙
A wall to save your book!

153
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:12,782
异教徒…
Pagens ...

154
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,856
克鲁姆的崇拜者们
Crom worshipers...

155
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,176
我们的墙的坚固\n会让他们知道我们的信念有多坚定
It is with the strenght of our walls, that they will \ncome to trust the strenght of our faith.

156
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:26,240
反正 我只擅长绘经 卡拉
You were always good at the old drawing, Cellach.

157
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:31,526
是的 如果不介意的话\n我还有很多事要做
Yes, well if you'd excuse me... \nI have a lot to attend to.

158
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,456
没有墙能阻挡维京人的进攻
No wall can stop the North Men, abbot.

159
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,138
当他们来时 我们能做的只有逃跑
When they come, all we can do is run

160
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,713
并且祈祷我们跑的足够快
and hope that\nare we're fast enough.

161
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,719
走吧 潘戈
Come on Pangur.

162
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,114
潘戈！
Pangur!

163
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,517
我不会让书受到任何损伤的
I don't mean the book any harm.

164
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:34,707
我所见过的都是凯尔斯内的书
All I've ever seen is inside the walls of Kells.

165
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:37,713
我就看一张就行
If I could just see one page

166
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:38,974
求你了
Please.

167
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,456
好吧
Well!

168
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,451
这不是那个有大问题的小朋友吗？
If it isn't the little brother with\nthe big questions?

169
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,783
- 我不是有意…\n- 我懂
- I didn't mean to ...\n- I understand.

170
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:59,076
你厌倦了偷听我和卡拉的谈话\n然后就跑到这里来了
You got bored eavesdropping on the abbot's private conversation\nand decided to rummed through my things.

171
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:01,255
不 不是这样的
Oh, no, that's not it!

172
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:04,291
别激动 别激动 我没有生气
Calm down lad, I won't tell on ya.

173
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,230
可能我…
Maybe I ...

174
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:12,225
修士们说 有罪的人看了书就会变成瞎子
The brothers said that sinners are\nblinded if they glassed at the book.

175
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,733
所以我还是不要看了…
So maybe I shouldn't

176
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,814
你真认为会这样？
Is that what you really believe what happened?

177
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:21,610
生活充满了疑问 是不是？
There's nothing in this life but mist, is there lad?

178
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:24,301
这是你自己的决定 不是别人的
It's your decision, no one else's.

179
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:37,831
真正宝贵的不是封面 打开它
The cover is not the real treasure. Open it!

180
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,763
天使之作
The work of angels.

181
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:51,524
“天使之作” 潘戈邦 你听到了没？
"The work of the angels"\nDid you hear that, Pangur?

182
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,514
我不知道天使会不会和我看起来一样有趣
I didn't know that angels would be\nas funny looking as me.

183
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,800
或许这个男孩真的失明了
Maybe it's the boy has gone blind.

184
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,623
我第一次看到它的时候也这么想
I thought the very same,\nwhen I first saw it.

185
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:08,553
但那仅仅是层皮囊 就像你和我一样
But it is only the work of\nmere mortals I'm afraid, like me or you.

186
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:12,902
这书是黑暗时代里光明的曙光
The book is a beacon in these dark days\nof the North Men.

187
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:16,440
你想不想看看最美丽的那页？
Do you want to see the most beautiful page?

188
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:21,445
能让黑暗变成光明的那页？
The one that will turn darnkess into light?

189
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:29,068
这就是神启之页
It is to be, the "Chi Ro" page.

190
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:34,046
但这里还什么也没有
But it hasn't been made yet.

191
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:38,596
没有 但它会成为整本书\n最光辉灿烂的一页
No, but it will become the most glorious page \nof the entire book.

192
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:41,345
告诉我 布兰登 你愿意帮我吗
Tell me Brendan, would you like to help?

193
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:44,779
当然 非常愿意\n我一直都在看其他修士绘经
Oh yes, please! I help the brothers\nfind quills all the time.

194
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,071
冷静 冷静 小修士
Calm down, calm down, little brother.

195
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:52,848
首先 你可以帮我\n在古老的橡树上收集一些这个
Now to start with, you can help me gather some of these,\nfrom an old oak tree.

196
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,310
这是什么
What is this?

197
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:59,974
这是个小小的普通浆果\n但可以制成你所见过的最深的翡翠绿墨水
It's a humble little berry, but it makes the \ndeepest emerald green ink you'll ever see.

198
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:06,231
如果你能帮我从树林里找来一打\n我会告诉你怎么做的 来吧
If you help me get a dozen or so from the forest\nI'll show you how to make it, so, come on!

199
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,178
你怎么还在这里？
What's keeping you?

200
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:16,067
我不能去 我不能到墙那边
I can't go. I'm not allowed to go outside the wall.

201
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,613
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

202
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,708
的确很危险
It is, dangerous.

203
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,726
在艾奥纳
Iona

204
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:29,023
我的修士兄弟在外面丧命在他们手下
I lost my brothers to attackers \nfrom the outside.

205
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,853
只能通过这本书来纪念他们
Now I have only the book to remember them by.

206
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:39,111
但是如果我的兄弟在这 他们会告诉你
But if my brothers where here now\nthey would tell you you'll learn more in the woods

207
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:43,212
在树林里 通过石头和树木\n可以学到的东西 比任何地方都多
from trees and rocks\nthan from any other place.

208
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,944
你会看到奇迹
You'll see miracles.

209
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,980
这是院长很久之前就知道的
And that is something the abbot knew, a long time ago.

210
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:03,758
我从来没有见过这样的东西 潘戈
I've never seen anything like it, Pangur.

211
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,766
我真很愿意帮助伊丹修士
I really want to\nhelp brother Aidan.

212
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:12,397
我认为我自己就可以\n弄到那些制作墨水的浆果
I think I could get\nthose ink berries all by my self.

213
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:17,028
我可以去森林\n伊丹修士肯定会很惊讶的…
I could go into the forest.\nwouldn't brother Aidan be surprised ...

214
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:18,989
但是院长…
But the abbot ...

215
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:22,211
我要在他发现之前回来
I'll be back before he'd even missed me.

216
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,844
但是 如果我迷路了怎么办…
But .. What if I get lost ...

217
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,098
在黑暗中
... in the dark?

218
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,684
不 我不应该出去
No! I should never go out there!

219
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,762
但是 如果我一直想着那本书…
if I keep thinking\nof the book

220
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:40,607
我就不会害怕黑暗了
I won't be afraid of the dark.

221
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,828
而且 我确定我不会天黑才回来
And I'm sure I won't have to go that far.

222
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:49,243
就这么定了 潘戈邦\n明天我就到森林里去
Alright so, Pangur Ban.\nTomorrow I'll go into the forest!

223
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:09,623
潘戈！
Pangur!

224
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:38,594
当然 如果我知道橡树长什么样就好了
Ofcourse, it might help if I knew what\nan oak tree looked like.

225
00:21:56,467 --> 00:22:00,247
可能还是回去比较好…
Maybe we'd better go home...

226
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,732
是这条路吗？你还记得吗？
Was it this way? Do you remember?

227
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:14,600
别害怕 潘戈\n我们在天黑之前找到路就行
Don't panic, Pangur. We just have\nto find the way back before dark.

228
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:32,887
神 请帮助我吧
Ow no, it's hard enough...

229
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:34,770
这是你的猫猫吗？
Is this your cat?

230
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,096
好吧
Well?

231
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:46,054
我听说过 你们这种生物
I've heard about creatures like you

232
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,389
你是妖精 对不对？
You're a fairy!

233
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,487
你在我的森林里干嘛？\n你是来破坏的 对吧
What are you doing in my forest?\nYou've come to spoil it, haven't you?

234
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,986
你可能是你家人派来找食物的 对不对？
You were probably sent here by your family,\nto get food, weren't you?

235
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:06,074
现在你从哪儿来回哪去
Well, you can go right back where you came from.

236
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,798
如果不的话 我就让狼来吃了你！
If you don't, I'll make the wolves get you!

237
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:10,840
不要！
No!

238
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:16,417
我不是那个意思 你看 我很抱歉 好吗？
I didn't mean to ... Look, I'm sorry alright?

239
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:19,974
我不是来给我家人弄吃的\n我是来找做墨水的东西
I'm not here to get food for my family. \nI 'm here to get things to make ink.

240
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,511
我没有家人 而且我们凯尔斯里也有吃的
I don't have a family, and we\nhave food in Kells.

241
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:27,011
所以我不是为吃的而来 我只是迷路了…
So I wouldn't come here for it anyway.\nI was just a bit lost.

242
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,399
你没有家人？
You have no family?

243
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,584
没有
No.

244
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,706
没有妈妈？
No mother?

245
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:39,317
我也是一个人
I'm alone too.

246
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:44,536
如果这是你的森林 你肯定什么都知道
If this is your forest, you must\nknow everything about it.

247
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:45,725
当然
Well, of course.

248
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:47,074
等等
No Wait!

249
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,387
有人吗？
Hello?

250
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:52,335
别那么大声 快走
Shhh...not so loud! Go away!

251
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:56,983
等等 拜托 你知道哪里能弄到这个吗？
No wait Please! Do you know where\nyou can find these?

252
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,733
知道
Yes

253
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,422
但是那个是不能吃的
But you can't eat those.

254
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:04,739
我不是要吃 是要做墨水用
I don't want to eat them, they're for ink.

255
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,235
墨水是什么？
What is ink?

256
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:12,010
写书用的
It 's for the book ...

257
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,356
画图用的
For make pictures.

258
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:17,209
液体的颜色 画到纸上的
Liquid colour, you put it on pages...

259
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:21,507
就像叶子一样的…很难解释\n你有机会应该看一看
like leaves ... it's hard to explain,\nI suppose you'd have to see it.

260
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:25,768
我不知道你在说些什么\n而且我也不想知道…
I do not know what you're talking about,\nand I don't want to know ...

261
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:27,146
但是伊丹修士…
But.. brother Aidan ...

262
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:31,277
我可以帮你 但是有个条件…
I will help you find the things you want, \non one condition ...

263
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:38,242
你和你的宠物\n必须保证再也不到我的森林里来
You and your pet must promise\nto never come into my forest again.

264
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,657
好的 我保证
Alright then. We promise.

265
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:50,572
好吧 过来 问问森林他们在哪
Come on then, I'll ask the forest where they are.

266
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,051
问啥？什么？
Ask the... what ...?

267
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:55,902
嗨 等等！
Hey, wait!

268
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:59,426
我叫布兰登 你呢？
My name is Brendan. What's yours?

269
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:13,477
这是个奇迹 就像伊丹说的那样
It's a miracle, just like Aidan said.

270
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:14,729
伊丹是我的朋友
Aidan is my friend.

271
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,344
我在帮他书写世界上最不可思议的书
I'm helping him make the most incredible\nbook in the whole world.

272
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:24,759
会让黑暗变成光明 你等着会看到的
He sais it'll turn darkness into light.\nWait until you see it!

273
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,386
你等着看我另外的那片森林
Wait until you see the rest of my forest!

274
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:43,906
你跑的真快
You're fast.

275
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:47,425
是的 我是跑的最快的
Yes, I'm the fastest.

276
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:48,717
那么…
So ...

277
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,428
浆果在哪里？
Where are the berries then?

278
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:59,816
你以前爬过树吧？
You have climbed a tree before, haven't you?

279
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:03,974
是的 当然 小菜一碟
Yes, of course. It's easy.

280
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,870
那就来吧
Come on so!

281
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:41,096
我救了你的命 今天的第二次了
Saved your life, second time today.

282
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:44,352
你说过你会爬树的
I thought you knew how to climb trees.

283
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:46,661
我的确会 不过是小些的
I do. Smaller ones.

284
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,195
对 灌木丛而已
Yeah ... like bushes.

285
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:52,859
别往下看 快来
Don't look down. Come on!

286
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:00,886
看！
Look!

287
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,002
一个昆虫认出了另一个昆虫
One beatle recognizes another.

288
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,132
拜托！
Come on!

289
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:42,868
睁开眼睛 我告诉你我的名字
Open your eyes and I'll tell you my name.

290
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,810
阿诗玲
Aisling.

291
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,509
这 就是我的森林
and this, is my forest.

292
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,382
我告诉他们了 他们不会叮你的
I asked them not to sting you.

293
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:09,707
这就是你要找的果子…
Here's what you're looking for ...

294
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,993
但是他们算不上浆果
... but they're not really berries.

295
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,332
有点像野猪柿
They look like boar droppings.

296
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:17,322
闻起来也有点臭
They're kind of stinky too.

297
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,490
你弄完了 就要爬下去啦
If you're finished, It's time to go back down.

298
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,828
爬下去…
back down ...

299
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:30,661
往左边一点
A bit left.

300
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:33,789
不 等一下！别踩那个…
No wait! Don't lean on that ...

301
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,131
…树枝
... branch.

302
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:40,703
我很抱歉花了这么久才爬下来
I'm sorry it took so long to come down.

303
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:42,589
除了最后那一摔…
Except for the last part ...

304
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:46,928
你最好现在回去吧\n我知道一条去你家的秘密小路
We'd better go now. I know a secret way to get you home

305
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:48,140
来吧！
Come on!

306
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,222
看！
Look!

307
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:02,049
布兰登？
Brendan?

308
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:21,117
你在干什么？回来啊！
What are you doing? Come away!

309
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:25,577
这里是苦难之地
This is a place of suffering.

310
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,419
苦难？是什么意思？
Suffering? What do you mean?

311
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,079
只管回来吧！那里太危险了
Just come away! It's too dangerous.

312
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:35,450
肯定不会比爬大橡树还危险吧
Surely it can't be more dangerous\nthan climbing an oak tree.

313
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:38,441
这是黑暗生物的巢穴
It is the cave of the Dark One.

314
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:39,982
克鲁姆库鲁克？
Crom Cruach?

315
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:43,356
但是克鲁姆库鲁克是骗小孩的故事
But Crom Cruach's only a story for children.

316
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,631
凯尔斯的修道院长说\n不应该害怕虚构的东西
The Abbot of Kells, says you shouldn't\nbe afraid of imaginary things.

317
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:50,102
那不是虚构的
It's not imagined.

318
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:55,937
它在黑暗中等待着 等着有人误入歧途
It's waiting in the darkness.\nWaiting for someone to awaken it.

319
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,969
阿诗玲 你只是自己吓自己罢了
Aisling, you're only scaring yourself.

320
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:01,740
修道院长说 那都是异教徒的胡话
The abbot sais that that's all pagan\nnonesense.

321
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,378
克鲁姆库鲁克这种东西是不存在的
There's no such thing as Crom Cruach...

322
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:11,084
不要说出它的名字！
Don't... speak it's name!

323
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,475
你真的被吓到了？
You're really frightened?

324
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:29,610
阿诗玲！
Aisling!

325
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:36,479
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?

326
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,755
那是什么东西？
What was that?

327
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,453
我跟你说过了…
I told you ...

328
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,596
克鲁姆！
Crom!

329
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,568
- 布兰登？\n- 恩？
- Brendan?\n- Huh?

330
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,554
你可以再来森林 如果你想的话
You can visit the forest again, if you like.

331
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:01,399
潘戈邦也可以来
And Pangur can come too.

332
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:16,788
- 但是在艾奥纳我们都…\n- 这里不是艾奥纳
- But sir, on Iona we always arange them ...\n- This is not Iona.

333
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:19,884
绘经院会按我的计划安排
The scriptorium will be arranged according to \nmy instructions.

334
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,079
但这不是好的…
But this is not good ...

335
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:25,563
会是的 如我所说
It will be as I say.

336
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:29,117
伊丹修士！我找到了！
Brother Aidan! I found them! I...

337
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:32,978
好啊 布兰登 今天没怎么看到你
Well, Brendan. It's about time we saw you today.

338
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,205
你去哪儿了？
Where have you been?

339
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,845
我等你说呢 你去哪了？
I'm listening. Where were you?

340
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:53,204
我…
I ...

341
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,897
我去森林里了
I went into the forest.

342
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,619
只是个小森林 没去多久
Just for a little while, not very long.

343
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,584
是为了帮伊丹修士…
Just... It was for Brother Aidan ...

344
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,751
布兰登 关于墙外的世界\n难道我告诫你的还不够多吗？
Brendan. Have I not warned enough\nabout what lies beyond these walls?

345
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:06,890
- 是的 但是…\n- 然而 你却不听我话
Yet you disobey me.

346
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:07,957
我知道 但是为了书…
I know, but for the book ...

347
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:13,252
布兰登 没有我的允许\n再也不许你离开修道院半步
Brendan. You are never to leave\nthe abbey again without my permission.

348
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:14,646
但是 叔叔 如果你看了书的话…
Uncle, if you see the book ...

349
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:17,328
你听明白了吗？
Do you Understand?

350
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:18,126
是的 叔叔
Yes, uncle.

351
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:20,303
那好
Good.

352
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:25,886
那过来吧 还有很多功课要做
Now come along, there are matters to attend to\nin the workroom.

353
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:13,453
- 看！…我找到了\n- 什么？
- Look!\n- What?\n- I found them.

354
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,516
你找到了 你真找到了
You did? So you did!

355
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:18,507
有人帮忙才找到的…
I did have a little help.

356
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,943
森林里的一位朋友
From a friend in the forest.

357
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:25,875
有朋友的话\n没什么事是做不到的 对吧？
There's nothing you can't do\nwhen you have friends to help you, right?

358
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:27,503
好的 我们来瞧瞧
Now, let's see.

359
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,683
不错 不错 我相信这个一定能表现出色
Yes, yes ... I believe\nthese will do very nicely ...

360
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,827
从小小的浆果 到宏伟的图画诞生
From tiny berries do great images come to life

361
00:34:35,828 --> 00:34:36,871
来吧！
Come along!

362
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,750
很多烟…这是个好预兆
Lot of smoke ... that's a good sign.

363
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:09,860
- 是吗？\n- 当然
- It is?\n- Yes.

364
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:15,230
- 多漂亮\n- 从一个发臭的浆果…
- Ah, beautiful.\n- From a stinky berry.

365
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:18,395
这个墨水是很棒 但还是一无是处…
Making ink is all very well, but it is useless ...

366
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,460
…如果缺了这个的话
... without one of these.

367
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:21,816
没有允许…我不能…
I'm not... I'm not allowed to...

368
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:24,682
这里只有我们两个人
There's no one else here now.

369
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:26,821
只有你
Just you

370
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,728
还有你的想象力
and your imagination.

371
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:34,991
怕了吗？
Afraid?

372
00:35:35,028 --> 00:35:39,902
我？不 我才不害怕想象东西呢
Me? No. I'm not afraid of imaginary things.

373
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:48,233
接着来 有始有终
Keep going! Finish what you start.

374
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:14,943
金子！
Gold!

375
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:01,518
不错
Not bad.

376
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,890
要我说 你肯定有能力来做…
I'd say he could do it right enough.

377
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,211
做什么？
Do what?

378
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,290
我必须对你坦白 孩子
I must confess my boy.

379
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,971
我之前没有完全对你说真话
I haven't been completely honest with you.

380
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:16,951
我没法绘画那神启的一页
I can not do the Chi-ro page.

381
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:20,931
我的眼睛已经昏花 我的手也开始颤抖
My eyes have become too old.\nAnd my hands unsteady.

382
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,517
但是…你说…
But .. you said ...

383
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:25,051
- 你应该来画那一页！\n- 我？
- You should be the one to do that page!  - Me?

384
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:27,116
不！我肯定不行…
No! I can never...

385
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:29,110
肯定还有别的什么人可以来做！
there must be somebody else ...

386
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,210
还是你做好！我会做毁的
You have to do it.\nI would ruin it.

387
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,296
不不不 你当然做得来
No, no, no. Ofcourse you can do it.

388
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,381
你能找到那些浆果
You found those berries

389
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:38,527
你有一双灵巧的手
You've certainly developed a steady hand.

390
00:37:39,615 --> 00:37:43,984
在我到这里之前\n你已经从别的修士那里学到了不少
Even before I came you'd already learned much\nfrom the other brothers's work.

391
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,348
你只需要展开你的想象力
You've only to unleash your imagination!

392
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,693
我该走了
I have go.

393
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,905
这么早你去哪里了？
Where have you been so early?

394
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:01,596
来吧 还有很多事要做
Come along, there is much work to be done.

395
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,207
我不知道 潘戈
I don't know Pangur...

396
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:11,925
有些我看不到的东西在阻碍着他
Something I cannot see, stops him.

397
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:19,213
如果他想完成神的一页
If he is ever to light up the Chi-ro page...

398
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:25,880
他必须转过身来 正视\n无论那是什么 面对面
he'll have to turn around and stare whatever it\nis, in the face!

399
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:47,706
布兰登！
Brendan!

400
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:53,483
我们要出发去西墙的架子了 快一点！
We're moving the scaffolding to\nthe west wall. Hurry along now!

401
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:12,048
我觉得你是时候学习科伦巴努的秘密了
I think you're ready to learn Columb Kil's secret.

402
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:14,410
那迷人的细节
The mesmerizing detail ...

403
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:17,026
当然 你还需要另一个眼睛
Of course, you need another eye.

404
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,387
好的
Now ...

405
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:23,073
- 当我找到那水晶的时候\n- 修士…
- Once I find the crystal...\n- Brother ...

406
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,057
就好象打开了一个全新的世界 \n一个纤细的世界
...open up a whole new world...\na tiny wonder...

407
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:32,350
科伦巴努说不应该用那水晶\n除非用来做最重要的作品
Columb Kil instructed that the crystal \nshould never be used, for less than work\nthat's worthy of it. 

408
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,376
在艾奥纳就没用过
It has not been used since Iona

409
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:36,276
水晶 是什么？
What's... a crystal?

410
00:40:36,312 --> 00:40:40,494
不是一个简单的水晶\n是独一无二的水晶
This's not a crystal, it's The Crystal!

411
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:43,194
科伦巴努之眼
The eye of Columb Kil.

412
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:48,354
科伦巴努 一生中创作了超过300部书
Columb Kil created over 300 books in his lifetime.

413
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,898
凭一己之力
By his own hands!

414
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:53,592
当他的死亡快要降临之时
On his deathbed, he prayed that his apprentice 

415
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:56,590
他已经预见到那一天的到来
got a vision as clear and wonderful as his own.

416
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:59,625
而当他呼出最后一口气时…
then as he drew his last last breath ...

417
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,884
从他手中掉落…
it dropped from his hand ...

418
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:04,022
科伦巴努之眼
... the eye of Colomb Kil !

419
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:08,654
科伦巴努肯定也会想要你收下的
Colomb Kil would want it to go to you.

420
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:09,699
放哪了？
Where is it?

421
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,032
抱歉 潘戈
Sorry, Pangur.

422
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,628
你见过吗？
Have you seen it?

423
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,690
丢掉了
It's lost.

424
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,395
丢掉了！
It's all lost!

425
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:21,820
你最后一次见是什么时候？
Where did you last have it?

426
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,215
我不明白
I don't understand.

427
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:39,343
如果我能给你看看那水晶…
If I could show the crystal to you

428
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,778
就都明了了
all would become clear.

429
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,056
- 但是…\n- 但是我还是可以继续学习 不是吗？
- But ...\n- But I can still continue my training, can't I?

430
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:49,167
你学过昆虫翅膀上的细小花纹吗？
Have you ever studied the tiny pattern,\non a green fly's wing?

431
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:53,524
- 没有\n- 那没有水晶 永远也学不会了
- No.\n- And you'll never will without the crystal.

432
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:56,205
那我们祈祷奇迹发生呢？
What if we pray for a miracle?

433
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:58,239
就像科伦巴努那样的？
Like Colomb Kil did?

434
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,419
有人说 在那水晶\n被称为科伦巴努之眼之前
Some say, that before the crystal became known,\nas the eye of Columb Kil

435
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,141
还有一个古代名字
it had an ancient name.

436
00:42:06,142 --> 00:42:12,399
科伦巴努就是在那里得到水晶的\n在黑暗的深处
named from the creature that\nColomb Kil won the crystal from.\nDeep inside one of it's dweling places.

437
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,272
克鲁姆库鲁克！
Crom Cruach!

438
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:18,791
被称为 克鲁姆库鲁克之眼
It was called the eye of "Crom Cruach"

439
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,323
我没法告诉你这故事哪部分是真的…
I can't tell you which parts of this story\nare true and what parts ...

440
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:25,065
哪部分又笼罩在迷雾中…
... are shrouded by the mists.

441
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:30,483
人生就是充满了那么多迷…
Ah, there's nothing in this life but mist ...

442
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:35,568
却只有短暂的时间
We're only here for a short while...

443
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:55,499
别担心 潘戈
Don't worry, Pangur.

444
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,591
我不会一个人的
I won't be long.

445
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:15,652
我说过禁止你离开修道院
You've been forbidden to leave the abbey.

446
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:18,620
现在我同时禁止你进入绘经院
Now you are also forbidden to enter the\nscriptorium.

447
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:20,526
拜托 叔叔 你不明白
Please, Uncle, you don't understand.

448
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,393
我明白的一清二楚！
Oh I understand perfectly well!

449
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:25,174
不许再私自外出
No more escorsions.

450
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,281
不许再绘经 不许再见伊丹修士
No more scriptorium and no more brother Aidan.

451
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:31,365
不要
No.

452
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,601
你刚说什么？
What did you say?

453
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:37,681
我做不到
I can't do that.

454
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,711
我不能放弃那书 叔叔
I can't give up the book uncle

455
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:43,149
如果你能只看一页 就明白了
If you looked at just one page and\nsee why.

456
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,551
你忘了那有多么重要！
You've forgotten how important it is

457
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:47,765
你所想的只有筑墙
All you want from us is this wall.

458
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:50,951
伊丹修士说你曾经也是绘经师
Brother Aidan said you were an Illuminator once.

459
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:54,533
- 他说…\n- 够了！
- He said ...\n- That's enough!

460
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:03,279
如果我不能信任你能不惹麻烦\n你就必须留在这儿 到你明白事理
If I can't trust you to stay out of harm's way\nyou'll have to remain here, untill you'll see sense.

461
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:24,859
卡拉 拜托 不要怪那孩子\n我和他谈过 而…
Cellach, please, don't blame the boy.\nI'll have a talk with to him and...

462
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,670
- 你不能再那么做\n- 不能…
- You do no such thing.\n- You can't ...

463
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:32,822
坦恩修士会给他送去食物\n这里也不应该有让他分心的东西
Brother Tang will bring him his meals and once\nthere is nothing left here to distract him...

464
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:35,702
让我来保管这书 卡拉
Let me keep the book Cellach.

465
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:37,380
这是托付给我的
It was entrusted to me.

466
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,082
那好吧
Allright then.

467
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:47,772
但条件是 当春天到来时你就离开凯尔斯
But on the condition that you leave Kells with the\nfirst sign of spring.

468
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:39,776
布兰登！
<i> Brendan </i>

469
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,530
阿诗玲！
Aisling!

470
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,396
我该怎么帮你出来？
How can I get you out?

471
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,671
我不知道
I don't know.

472
00:45:57,717 --> 00:45:59,614
塔被锁上了
The tower is locked.

473
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:02,809
门被从外面锁上了
And my door is bolted from the outside.

474
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,246
钥匙在院长的屋子里
The key is in the abbot's room.

475
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:12,170
或许…你可以给伊丹修士送个信
Maybe ... you can take a message\nto brother Aidan.

476
00:46:36,776 --> 00:46:43,033
你需去我无法到达之处
You must go where I can not ...

477
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:49,258
潘戈邦 潘戈邦
Pangur Ban ...

478
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,507
为什么院长把你锁在那里？
Why did the abbot put you in there?

479
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:17,694
因为我不服从他
Because I disobeyed him .

480
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,736
为什么？
Why?

481
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,080
看！
Look!

482
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:24,914
- 克鲁姆之眼！\n- 不 这是个水晶
- The Eye of Crom!\n- No, it's a crystal.

483
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,474
我想它在黑暗生命的洞窟里
I think there's one in the Dark One's cave.

484
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,267
我必须去那里
I have to go there.

485
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:35,106
不 布兰登 你被它迷惑了\n你应该留在你的塔里
No Brendan, it's tricking you.\nYou should have stayed in your tower.

486
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:39,333
克鲁姆库鲁克夺走了我的亲人\n夺走了我的母亲
Crom Cruach took my people, it took my mother.

487
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:43,280
它吞噬一切 你会死的！
It takes everything. You will die!

488
00:48:43,316 --> 00:48:49,573
阿诗玲 如果我不去试的话\n书就永远无法完成了
Aisling, if I don't try, the book\nwill never be complete.

489
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:57,035
书…
The book ...

490
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:01,446
好吧 我会帮助你的…
Alright then, I will help you.

491
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:36,552
阿诗玲！这地方对你不好 你必须回去
Aisling! This place is hurting you,\nyou must go back.

492
00:49:36,588 --> 00:49:38,631
我们再想其他办法
I'll find someother way.

493
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:42,357
我必须帮助你…
I.. I must help you...

494
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,419
拜托 阿诗玲 快回去
Please hurry, go now!

495
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:59,382
将黑暗变为 光明
Turn the darkness into light.

496
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:37,970
阿诗玲！
Aisling!

497
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:42,969
阿诗玲！
Aisling!

498
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:07,415
老傻瓜！
Old fools!

499
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:10,480
老傻瓜应该缄口慎言
Old fools should learn to keep quite...

500
00:53:10,516 --> 00:53:13,895
除非小傻瓜想要聆听
... unless young fools want to listen ...

501
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:17,274
你来了！你是怎么…？
Ha! You're here! How ... How did you ...?

502
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,575
你是怎么跑出塔的？
How did you get out of the tower?

503
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:22,169
你必须在院长发现之前回去
You must go back before the abbot finds out.

504
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,658
这不是你该来的地方\n没什么东西给你看
This is not the place for you lad,\nthere is nothing for you here.

505
00:53:26,695 --> 00:53:29,407
但是你在这儿 书在这儿
But you're here, the book is here ...

506
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:32,042
还有 眼 也在这里
and the eye is here.

507
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:46,160
这怎么可能？它已经被毁掉了
How is this possible?!\nIt was destroyed!

508
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:48,858
这眼睛的故事不止一个
There is more than one story about the eye.

509
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,824
黑暗生物也不止一个
There is more than one dwelling place for the Dark One ...

510
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,753
眼也不止一个
and he had more than one eye.

511
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:59,602
你去了黑暗生物的洞穴？
You... you entered one of the Dark One's caves?

512
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:03,308
不是所有东西都能从书上学到的 是吧
You can find out everything from books you know.

513
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:06,659
这个我可知道
I think I read that once ...

514
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,045
好吧 那么 是时候开始了
Right then ... it is time to begin!

515
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:43,522
您的早餐 修道院长
Your breakfast, abbot.

516
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:46,452
拿去给布兰登
Take it to Brendan.

517
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,099
看他是否…
See if ...

518
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,579
看他是否懂些事了
See if he has come to his senses.

519
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:33,423
这就像天堂
It's like heaven, no?

520
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:36,170
天堂降落到人间
Heaven on Earth.

521
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:40,591
拜托 院长 这是我的错
Please ... please abbot, it's my fault.

522
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,282
你这小蠢货！
Little fool!

523
00:57:44,283 --> 00:57:49,851
北方人即将到来 而你在这里 绘画？
The North Men are upon us\nand here you are ... drawing!

524
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:53,944
离维京人攻击凯尔斯只有一天时间了！
We have one day before the Vikings\nattack Kells!

525
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,546
- 大门会挡不住的！\n- 我们必须逃离这里
- The gate won't hold.\n- We must run from here!

526
00:57:56,582 --> 00:58:00,190
门会挡住他们的！\n你去把难民带进教堂
The gate will hold!\nYou will lead the refugees into the chapel.

527
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,114
那里应该会在攻击到来时是安全的
They will seek comfort there untill the attackers\nmove on.

528
00:58:02,394 --> 00:58:04,300
坦恩 告诉村民待在家里
Tang! Tell villagers to stay in their house.

529
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:08,988
卡拉！
Cellach!

530
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,302
你就和你宝贵的书在这里会安全的
You'll be safe in here with your precious book.

531
00:59:32,312 --> 00:59:35,406
不 还不能…
No, not yet!

532
00:59:38,902 --> 00:59:40,990
待在屋里！
Stay inside!

533
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,395
坦恩！把门打开！
Tang! Open the door!

534
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:17,522
进塔里！
Into the tower!

535
01:00:28,621 --> 01:00:33,449
一次一个人！这梯子不够牢固
One at a time!\nThe steps aren't strong enough!

536
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:36,633
太多人了
Tang, there are too many!

537
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,707
太晚了
It's too late.

538
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:55,469
关上门！
Close the door!

539
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,017
布兰登！
Brendan!

540
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:48,876
墨水！我们来做墨水！
Ink! We have to make ink!

541
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,640
- 布兰登！不能…\n- 快！
- Brendan! Wait... we can't ...\n- Hurry!

542
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:19,151
叔叔！
Uncle!

543
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,085
不！
No!

544
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,452
不！我们要去救他！
No! We must save him!

545
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:29,580
布兰登 去森林的密道在哪里？
Quickly Brendan, where is the\nsecret passage to the forest?

546
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:31,266
我们要去救他！
We have to save him!

547
01:02:31,303 --> 01:02:34,238
我们救不了
We can't help him now.

548
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:40,541
布兰登！
Brendan!

549
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:26,838
我们不能停
We... We cannot stop.

550
01:03:28,496 --> 01:03:30,067
我必须回去
I have to go back.

551
01:03:30,103 --> 01:03:34,960
维京人在艾奥纳一人也不放过\n他们在凯尔斯也不会留情的
The North Men left no one on Iona,\nthey will leave no one on Kells

552
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:38,114
- 我叔叔\n- 他是为了保护你
- My uncle...\n- He lived to protect you.

553
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:41,267
用他唯一知道的方法…
The only way he knew how ...

554
01:03:41,304 --> 01:03:44,384
现在 要由我来保护你
Now I must protect you

555
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:48,020
为了卡拉 也为了这本书
for Cellach and for the book.

556
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,677
金子！
Gold!

557
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:00,195
布兰登！
Brendan!

558
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,735
阿诗玲！
Aisling!

559
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:41,941
我们必须接着赶路了 布兰登\n希望我们跑得够快
We have to keep running, Brendan,\nand hope that we're fast enough.

560
01:06:00,735 --> 01:06:02,758
他还活着！
He's alive!

561
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:10,644
我好累
I'm so tired.

562
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:15,228
是时候放手了
Tang, leave me be.

563
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:18,055
拜托
Please ...

564
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,468
不要管我了
Leave me be...

565
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:29,413
你是凯尔斯的修道院长！
You are the abbot of Kells!

566
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,354
你必须起来
You must get up!

567
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,147
书写出来不是为了藏在高墙之后…
The book was never meant to be hidden away behind walls...

568
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:19,342
是为了向世界传播 激励启发人民
... locked away from the world which inspired its creation.

569
01:08:19,343 --> 01:08:20,386
布兰登
Brendan,

570
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:23,720
你要把书带给人民
You must take the book to the people

571
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:25,324
这样他们才能有希望！
So that they may have hope...

572
01:08:25,962 --> 01:08:29,395
来照亮北方黑暗的日子
let it light the way in these dark days of the North Men.

573
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:13,397
阿诗玲？
Aisling?

574
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,574
我好累
I'm so tired.

575
01:09:33,611 --> 01:09:36,213
拜托 院长 休息一下吧
Please, abbot, you must take your rest.

576
01:09:36,249 --> 01:09:41,479
休息？在我们最珍贵的东西被摧毁时吗？
Rest? With our most important\ntreasure destroyed?!

577
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,428
但我该怎么才知道？
But how was I to know?

578
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,039
才知道他在何方？
How could I know he would perish?

579
01:09:46,076 --> 01:09:47,972
拜托了 院长
Please, abbot.

580
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:56,784
他当时还只是个孩子
He was only a boy ...

581
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:11,568
黑暗的使者！不是现在！
Angel of Darkness! Not yet!

582
01:10:11,605 --> 01:10:16,142
还不行！我需要时间！
I need time!

583
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:35,360
叔叔
Uncle!

584
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,666
布兰登？
Brendan?

585
01:10:44,346 --> 01:10:46,491
这是梦吗？
It is a dream ...

586
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:50,311
这不是梦
This is no dream.

587
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:54,231
我那么高兴能在这儿找到你
I'm so happy to find you here.

588
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:57,762
我以为我失去了你 在很久之前
I thought I'd lost you a long ago.

589
01:10:57,907 --> 01:10:59,346
布兰登
Brendan!

590
01:11:00,312 --> 01:11:02,922
你当时还是个孩子
You were only a boy...

591
01:11:02,923 --> 01:11:05,754
那么多无辜的人死去了…
All those innocents... lost.

592
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:08,810
- 都是我的错\n- 请别 叔叔
- All my fault...\n- Please, uncle ...

593
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,580
…不要责怪你自己
... Do not distress yourself.

594
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:12,524
你不明白 
You don't understand.

595
01:11:12,793 --> 01:11:15,164
我没有时间 布兰登
I have no time, Brendan.

596
01:11:15,165 --> 01:11:16,708
你是对的
You were right ...

597
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:18,818
关于凯尔斯

598
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:20,592

600
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:24,492
我不应该…
I shouldn't have ...

601
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:27,490
这是我仅剩的了…
This is all I have left.

602
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:34,082
这是我在这世上唯一的慰籍
It is the only comfort I have in this world.

603
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,661
伊丹修士是对的
Brother Aidan was right ...

604
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:39,999
而我却阻止他
And I tried to stop him.

605
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:44,736
伊丹从没有怨你 叔叔
Aidan never paid you much heed, uncle.

606
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:49,363
或许吧…
I suppose not ...

607
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:55,656
伊丹修士继续着他的使命 而且完成了
Brother Aidan lived to see\nhis work passed on ... and completed.
