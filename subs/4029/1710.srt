1
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,382
爸爸，给我讲个故事吧。
Dad, tell me a story.

2
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,840
那就给你讲讲缅甸吧，
I can tell you about Burma,

3
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,715
这个曾被称作黄金之国的地方。
the time when it was called the Gold Country.

4
00:00:58,883 --> 00:01:01,215
想听吗？
This is a story that you like that?

5
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,799
想听！
Yes!

6
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,840
很久很久以前，有一个美丽的国家，
There was once a beautiful country,

7
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,965
缅甸。
Burma.

8
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,340
那里长满了
Everywhere there was

9
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:18,465
柚树和紫檀树。
forests of teak and ebony.

10
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:23,007
那时候，老虎经常在热带雨林出没，
At that time,tigers roamed the jungles

11
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:28,674
大象也悠闲地漫步在辽阔的大草原上。
and herds of elephants roamed the Great Plains.

12
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:32,466
这个美丽的国家就像是一颗
It was sapphires as blue as the sky azure

13
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:37,591
美丽的宝石（原文一堆比喻略去）或是
and rubies even redder than your cheeks.

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,133
即使像你这样的小公主，做梦也想象不出来的珠宝。
Jewelry that even a princess like you would not dream.

15
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:43,633
然后呢？
And then?

16
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:46,633
其实，这是一个悲伤的故事。
In fact, this is a sad story.

17
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,258
从遥远的异国来的军队
Soldiers came from a far country

18
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:53,508
抢走和毁灭了这里的一切。
and took of all that was most precious.

19
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,341
从此我们变得很穷很穷。
Thus we have become very poor.

20
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,926
宝贝闺女！
My treasure!

21
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,634
亲爱的，乖乖坐这好吗？
Sit there, my darling.

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,259
我得走了，妈妈就在那陪着你。
I gotta go, but mom is there.

23
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:57,803
仰光 1947

24
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:15,927
大家好！
Hello!

25
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:58,053
现在最需要的就是组建一个政府。
What is needed urgently
is to form a government.

26
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,387
没有群众的支持，
Without popular support

27
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:01,637
我们的政府
our government

28
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,887
就不会有民主上的合法性。
will have no democratic legitimacy.

29
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,055
摆平，闪！
Here we go.

30
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,638
昂山将军他……
General!

31
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:33,807
昂山素季
Aung San Suu Kyi

32
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,931
Aris先生，
M. Aris,

33
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,347
大夫在等你。
The doctor is waiting to see you.

34
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,348
-Hello,Michael. -你好，我是Michael。
-Hello,how r u?              -你好。
-Please take a seat.         -请坐。
-Thanks.                     -谢谢。

35
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,808
牛津 1998

36
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,598
你还有多少时间
It's always very difficult

37
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,807
很难说。
to predict progresses-something like this.

38
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,390
可能只有5个月
It could be as little as 5 months

39
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:10,848
最多也就5年。
or as long as 5 years.

40
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:14,640
得抓紧交待后事了。
Enough time for u to put ur affairs on ur hope.

41
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,390
需要我们通知你爱人来处理后事吗？
Would u like us to arrange for ur wife to come to
collect you?

42
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,807
我爱人？
My wife?

43
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,640
她要能来就好了。
Well,if she could.

44
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,473
她现在在缅甸呢。
Now she lives in Burma.

45
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:02,808
-Good morning!   -同学们好！
-Good morning!   -老师好！

46
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,183
请大家传阅。

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,183
谢谢。
Thank you.

48
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,934
今天我想谈谈
Today I want to talk

49
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:15,267
不丹人对忠于家庭的
about how the Bhutanese people has always

50
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,184
重视，
place great emphasis on family loyalty,

51
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,392
对邻里关系的重视，
Community...

52
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:25,600
以及对老人的尊重。
And respect for their elders.

53
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,685
下毛雨啊！
This damn rain!

54
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,685
是啊，下你妹啊。请进。
Yes,coming.

55
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:03,268
确定是癌了吗？
So, it's definite cancer,yes?

56
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,851
前列腺癌。
Prostate cancer, to be precise.

57
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:15,518
And did they give u any indications of how long before…？
他们告诉你还有多久了吗？

58
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:20,018
五个月到五年。
I have five months to five years.

59
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,476
坑爹啊，Michael。
Damn it, Michael.

60
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:25,476
五年也够做很多事了。
U know,I do achieve a lot in five years.

61
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:29,644
那Suu怎么办？
And what about Suu?

62
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:33,394
Truly she want to return to Oxford where she can…
她应该也想回来，这样她就能……

63
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:36,727
Anthony，you know if she ever left Burma,
Anthony，你要知道一旦她离开缅甸，

64
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,061
他们就不会再让她回去了。
they will never allow her to return.

65
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,477
那你怎么办，Michael？你三年没见她了。
And what about you, Michael?
You have not seen her for three years.

66
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,852
她是你的女人，是娃他娘。
She is your wife.
She is the mother of your children.

67
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,727
唯一可惜的是，她一离开，军政府就小人得意了。
It's only the military would
unfold the red carpet if she wanted to leave and come home.

68
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,894
她绝对不能离开。
She cannot possibly walk away.

69
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:56,436
已经流了太多的血，失去了太多的生命。
Too much blood has been shed,
too many lives was lost.

70
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,769
上百万人民都以她为寄托。
Millions of people are counting on her.

71
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:11,603
不管发生什么，Anthony。
Whatever it happens, Anthony

72
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,937
你必须答应我照顾好俺娃。
you must promise me you'll keep an eye for the boys.

73
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,187
当然，你还不放心我吗，你懂的。
Of Course!
You can count on me,100%,you know that.

74
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:18,478
我懂的。
Yes.

75
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,313
- Hello, darling.   -娃他爹。
- Hello, My angel.  -娃他娘。

76
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:17,938
书写得怎么样了？
How was the book going?

77
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,772
还早着呢。

78
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,272
闻起来好香啊。
That smells good.

79
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,689
- We'll have Burmese tonight.  -我们今天吃缅甸菜。
- Perfect.                     -我都馋了。

80
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,397
你坏。
Stop it.

81
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,314
起好名了吗？
You've found a title?

82
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:33,230
好了。
Yes.

83
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,272
我的父亲 （作者：昂山素季）
My Father

84
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,397

牛津 1988

86

七点吃晚饭。

00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,190
都做完了。
It's all done.

这里是缅甸，画面上是仰光的街头骚乱。
We were in Burma,

上万人集会抗议
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested

99
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,398
当局对学生的屠杀。
against the massacre of students
by the authorities.

100
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:23,565
据目击者称，
According to witnesses, hundreds of students

数百名参与在Inya湖的非暴力民主活动

被军队近距离射杀。

其他抗议者承受着剧烈的痛苦。

民主人士强烈抗议

106
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:41,149
自1962年开始上台的军政府。
who ruled the country with an iron fist
since the coup in 1962.

107
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,232
缅甸政府被认为是现存的
The Burmese government is known

108
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,399
最为专制和神秘的政府之一。
As one of the most repressive and
secrets regions.

109
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,857
但尽管军政府下决心镇压这起事件，
But despite the authorities' determination to crush the uprising,

110
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,149

越来越多的支持。

很高兴听到你的声音，

115
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,733
妈妈得了中风。
My mother had a stroke.

116
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:44,192
我送你上飞机。
I'll saw you on flight.

117
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,068
学乖，帮你爹干活，知道吗？
Be good,won't u?
Help your dad run the house.

118
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,526
我在那用不了电话。
It will be hard for me to get a phone.

119
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,693
所以如果联系不到我也别担心。
So do not worry before you hear from me.

120
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,443
你什么时候回来？

A week,or maybe two.

122
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,026
好了走吧。
Come on, let's go.

123
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,610
都这时候了。
It's very late.

124
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,610
快点，我们没时间了。
Come on, we do not have time.

125
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,360
我爱你。
I love you.

126
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,360
司机麻烦您快点。
Please, hurry.

127
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,820
- You come from England?   -你是英国来的？
- That's it.               -对。

128
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:21,236
呆多久？
You stay long?

129
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:23,278
看需要多久了。
The time it takes.

130
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:39,486
雷叔！
Uncle Leo!

131
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:42,028
你还是那么漂亮。
You're still beautiful!

132
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,821
你应该已经听说了，
You know what started it all,

133
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,404
仅仅因为将军觉得
this is because the decision to

134
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,987
9是他的幸运数字
ban any domination ​​that wasn't amount count of 9.

135
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:52,754
就强制在很多方面使用9进制。
（注：1987年，缅甸废除原大钞，改为
使用新印发的面值为45和90的两种货币，
这导致了1988年的骚乱）
For 9 is his lucky number.

136
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,487
连大学都使用9进制。
The universe is count by 9,

137
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,112
学生纷纷上街。
That's way the students took to the streets.

138
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,487
这一切都只是因为一个2b的迷信。
All this is just because of the superstitions of a madman.

139
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,487
有什么需要我的就给我电话。
Call me if u need me.

00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,247
你娘怎么样了？
How's your mother?

大夫说他们也帮不上什么了。

很抱歉。

他们都休息了，别担心。
Here they are in bed,

告诉Alex，我尽量在他生日前赶回来。

00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,337
一个作家和他的朋友。
A writer and his friends.

229
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:10,378
你和你爹长得很像。
You look like your father.

230
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,212
不好意思这么早就来打扰。
Sorry for coming so early.

231
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,253
我们刚刚知道您回来了。

232
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:21,045
不能放过这个好机会。

233
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:24,045
现在是非常时期。
This is a very important period.

234
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:26,420
我们有很多话要说。
We have so much to discuss.

235
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,253
进来说吧。
Let's start, then.

236
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:00,004
在这等我。
Wait for me here.

237
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,296
你的鞋。
Your shoes.

238
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,589
这几天
I'm surrounded by bad vibes

239
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,422
我觉得阴风阵阵。
right now.

240
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:28,380
这不是什么妖魔鬼怪，
None of the 37 spirits.

241
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:31,172
而是一个孤魂。
It's a ghost.

242
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,589
那
So

243
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,464
是他吗？
it could be him?

244
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:36,547
就是他。
Yes

245
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,172
本来只有他也掀不起什么风浪，
this is one of the ancestors.

246
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,839
可是，
But

247
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:43,714
现在他有了帮手，
a spirit came to assist.

248
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:45,297
一个远道而来的不速之客。
Coming from afar.

249
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:47,756
是一个女人吗？
A woman?

250
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:52,965
也许是吧。
Maybe.

251
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:56,673
要不要让她躲猫猫呢？
Should I remove it?

252
00:26:57,007 --> 00:27:00,256
这样会更危险。
The spirit became ghost
is even more dangerous.

253
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:01,965
那，
In this case,

254
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:05,256
还望指点迷津。
how do I get rid of?

255
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,798
一切异象，皆有因果。
If the people are at peace,

256
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,215
国泰民安，妖魔乃遁。
he will not need spirit,

257
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:12,923
切记切记。
and return it to where it came from.

258
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,006
大仙救命之恩无以为报。
Thank you very much.

259
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:23,673
只要除了这妖孽，定为大仙重修庙宇再塑金身。
Your advice is always valuable to me.

260
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:29,716
我就是雷叔。
Leo!

261
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:31,507
很高兴见到您。
So happy to see you.

00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:34,799
很高兴你能来。走吧。
It is good to have u back.
Come on,let's go,please.

263
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:44,716
娘！
Mom!

264
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,216
我想死你们了。
I missed you.

265
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,008
你最后做好心理准备，这里可是一团乱。
You'd better be prepared for complete chaos.

266
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:12,592
快点！
Come on!

267
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,133
你好！
Hello!

268
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,550
你好吗？
My My, how are you?

269
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:25,758
很好。
I'm fine.

270
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,592
很高兴见到你。
Nice to see you again.

271
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,884
- Doctor Aris.    -Aris教授。
- Tom!                -Tom!

272
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:44,093
- Okay?           -你怎么样？
- You look rang.  -几年没见又帅了嘛。

273
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,551
本来不想过来，
I was on the principle

274
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:49,593
不过想想Suu一个人在这照顾她母亲。
that  Suu
lived alone to care for her mother.

275
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:53,593
历史学家很少身临其境真正的历史，享受这一切吧。
Historians rarely see history in motion. Enjoy it.

276
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:55,926
有什么需要帮忙的，尽管找我。
Please let me help if u need anything.

277
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:56,926
多谢了。
Thank you very much.

278
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:17,343
很高兴见到你。
I'm glad you're here.

279
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,260
再往下一点。
Get down down down.

280
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,385
再远一点。
A little further.

281
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:26,510
好，就放这吧。
Stop.

282
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,260
快过来。
Step away.

283
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,302
他哇哩哇啦什么？
what did he say?

284
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:37,385
他说
He says

285
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:42,844
政府会考虑民众的诉求，
that the government can no longer ignore popular discontent,

286
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,385
政府对最近一段时间的动荡
and it assumes its share of responsibility

287
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,927
负有不可推卸的责任。
in the turmoil of recent months.

288
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:55,635
他自己年龄大了，
And because he's getting old,

289
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,261
也需要休息了。
He will resign.

290
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:05,303
我们马上会进行一场公投以决定国家的未来走向。
We will have a referendum on the
country's political future.

291
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,011
你好。
Hello.

292
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:37,304
几个自称来自大学的人想和您谈谈，他们刚说……
Someone from the university want to speak to u.
They said it is...

293
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:39,637
有急事。
It's urgent.

294
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:49,471
夫人，我们都是历史系教授。
Madam,my colleagues and I are academics on the history faculty.

295
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:51,179
我们都相信
And we believe

296
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:54,471
只有您，才能带领我们走向民主自由的光辉大道。
you are the only person who can lead the country to democracy now.

297
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,054
因为您是昂山将军的女儿，
As the daughter of Aung San,

298
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,929
人民自然都会团结起来追随您的脚步。
the people will automatically unite behind u.

299
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,637
您的父亲为了缅甸的民族独立人民解放奋斗终身。
Your father fight for independence of Burma.

300
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,596
这是完成他遗志的好机会。
Here is an opportunity to finish what he began.

301
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:13,347
我们必须抓住这个机会。
We must seize this opportunity.

302
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,263
可是我没有一点经验啊。
I'm lack of experience,

303
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:20,513
你看，
as u can see,

304
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,388
我需要过自己的生活。
I have something to do.

305
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,763
可以再考虑考虑吗？
May I ask you take sometime to consider?

306
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,181
让这些狗消失。
Banish these dogs!

307
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:01,973
过来。
Come!

308
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,556
将军，大学里的六个教授
General
six professors from the University

309
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,306
告诉昂山素季说人民需要她。
came to tell Aung San Suu Kyi
that the people supported it.

310
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,556
还有呢？
That's it?

311
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:19,098
他们说要争取民主。
They are fighting for democracy

312
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,973
他们想做别有用心的一小撮人。
they want it to take the lead.

313
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,223
不能任他们乱来了。
It shall not proceed further.

314
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,389
将军英明。
That's it.

315
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:27,599
好，去吧。
Well, okay.

316
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:36,557
明天，昂山素季去大金塔。
Tomorrow, Aung San Suu Kyi will go
to Shwedagon.

317
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,183
你的鞋。
Your shoes.

318
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,391
老妖婆，敢玩我。
Bad,minds do not have warned you!

319
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,475
我们已经仁至义尽，但反革命分子的气焰更加嚣张。
Finally,the idea of ​​consulting the people

320
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,641
跟他们没有什么好谈的了。
is not the solution.

321
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,016
是您让谈判的啊。
It was an idea to you.

322
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:24,808
一时糊涂，
Turns

323
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:28,891
我也是被蒙蔽了。
I have been badly advised.

324
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:31,100
登盛将军，
General Sein Lwin ,

325
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,725
给你个任务，
I have a mission to tell you.

326
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,391
制止非法集会，
You will dismantle the centers of opposition

327
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,975
谁敢负隅顽抗，坚决逮捕。
and deter troublemakers.

328
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:41,891
太多了，抓得过来吗？
There's a lot of people.

329
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:46,226
监狱有的是地方。
Our prisons are big enough.

330
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,517
眼下最重要的就是
The most important

331
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:53,767
盯着昂山素季等一小撮人。
is to keep an eye on
Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters.

332
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:55,767
将一切不稳定因素消灭在萌芽状态。
Stop any gathering.

333
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,059
- At your orders, sir.  -保证完成任务。
- Okay.                -等你们的好消息。

334
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:15,392
我们支持你。
We have only respect and admiration for you.

335
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:20,517
只能走着过去了。
We must continue on foot.

336
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:21,643
好。
Alright.

337
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:28,310
走吧。
Let's go.

338
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,852
停车！
Stop the car!

339
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:37,852
娃们，跟我来。
The boys, come on.

340
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:39,893
快点。
Hurry.

341
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:03,728
爹，我们去找点吃的。
Dad, we will look for something to eat.

342
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,186
好，别走太远啊。
Okay, but not too far.

343
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:19,061
可能有点晚了，
It may be a little late to be seen,

344
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:22,311
可是我从来没演讲过。
but I've never done public speaking.

345
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:24,519
不要想太多。
But there is no time to priest!

346
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:26,394
我们在下面看着你。
We'll be watching from the outside.

347
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,395
尊敬的各位师傅（愿意为和尚），尊敬的父老乡亲。
Reverend monks, the Burmese people!

348
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,729
今天我们共聚一堂，
The purpose of this gathering

349
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:17,645
就是要让全世界听见这片土地上人民的呼声。
Is to make the world hear
the people's will.

350
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:28,271
今天我们共聚一堂
The purpose of this gathering today

351
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:33,355
就是向全世界庄严宣告
is to affirm the desire of the entire country
to be a multiparty democracy.

352
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,605
——我们要将自己的祖国建设成为一个多党制民主国家。
This is what we want to demonstrate.

353
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:45,521
你们中的一些可能不认识我，
Some of you do not know my story

354
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,771
也想听听
and that's quite normal

355
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:51,855
我的故事。
to want to know what it is.

356
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,856
因为我一直生活在海外，
Because I have lived abroad

357
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:56,981
和一个外国人结为夫妻。
and I married a foreigner,

358
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,814
他们就说我不懂缅甸的历史和国情。
they say I do not understand
complex history of the country.

359
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:06,314
老实说，
Let me honestly say

360
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:09,522
他们是对的，我在海外生活
that's true.I lived abroad.

361
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:12,772
也确实嫁给了一个外国人。
And I am also married to a foreigner.

362
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,731
但这都不能阻挡
But this is not provided

363
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,814
我对这片土地无比炽烈的爱，
my love and my devotion to my country

364
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:21,897
连减轻分毫都不能。
Tampering or mitigated.

365
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:31,522
我的父亲将自己的一生
My father gave everything he had

366
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:34,482
献给了缅甸的民族独立和人民解放。
in political life of Burma

367
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:37,107
并为此付出了自己年轻的生命。
and he paid with his life.

368
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:40,398
作为他的女儿，
As the daughter of my father,

369
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:43,065
我不能再对这片土地上发生的一切
I can not remain indifferent

370
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:45,940
视而不见。
events taking place right now.

371
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:50,607
现在，前方已经隐隐地浮现出一丝曙光，
The goal we hold so dear
is now in sight.

372
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:54,107
我们再一次地呼吁让
We call for free elections

373
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,523
规范的民主选举
and regular,

374
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,023
在最短的时间内成为现实。
in the shortest possible time.

375
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:03,857
母亲！
Mom!

376
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,648
让我们永不分离，
Let us not divide.

377
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:12,232
联合起来，共同迎接我们的胜利。
Unite forward together towards our goal!

378
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,399
昂山女士！
Daw Suu!

379
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:46,941
上百万人？
A million people?

380
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,275
可能没这么多。
Maybe not quite a million.

381
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:52,650
媒体也在？
And the press?

382
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,734
昂山素季,
Aung San Suu Kyi,

383
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:06,067
昂山将军之女,
the daughter of General Aung San

384
00:39:06,235 --> 00:39:09,817
生活在牛津的一个家庭主妇，两个孩子的母亲，
And until now housewife in Oxford
and mother of two,

385
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,567
成为缅甸走向未来的希望。
became the great hope for the future
in Burma.

386
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:30,026
难以置信，是吗？
It was incredible.

387
00:39:30,194 --> 00:39:32,360
必须的，不过
Yes, absolutely. However...

388
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:34,818
罗马不是一夜建成的，
A quarter century

389
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:37,568
我们也别高兴得太早。
of oppression will not be all done in one day.

390
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:43,276
革命尚未成功同志仍需努力。
There's still a great deal to do.

391
00:39:48,944 --> 00:39:53,360
这可是Raj的宝贝，在奈温发现以前，你还有点时间。
A pearl of the Raj. It was 80
until Ne Win expelled them.

392
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:56,485
就这。
Here we are.

393
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:00,735
漂亮！
Wonderful!

394
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:28,777
得走了。
You have to go.

395
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,611
我们还有时间。
There is still time.

396
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:34,736
全国民主联盟
National League for Democracy

397
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:54,737
- Thank you, Tom.    -谢了，Tom。
- You are welcome.   -应该的。

398
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:04,153
Kim，怎么了？
What's wrong, Kim?

399
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:06,403
你已经错过Alex的生日了，
You've missed Alex's birthday,

400
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:08,820
马上又要错过我的了。
and now you are going to miss mine.

401
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:13,320
你们留在这太危险了。
It's too dangerous for you to remain here.

402
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,987
如果出什么事怎么办？
I should never forgive myself
if something happens to you.

403
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,738
再说也快开学了，你们不能落下学习。
Anyway.A new term is beginning and u should leave.

404
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,488
为了我
Please...

405
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,988
做一个男子汉好吗？
try to be brave for me.

406
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,696
- Watch over your brother.   -照顾好你弟弟。
- Yes.                       -必须的。

407
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:45,196
常来信。
I want you to write me every day.

408
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:46,738
娘，我们走了。
Goodbye, Mom.

409
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,696
- Be strong.    -做个男子汉。
- Do not worry. -必须的。

410
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:54,571
- I love you.   -我爱你们。
- I love you.   -我们也爱你。

411
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,364
瞧一瞧那个看一看，全国民主联盟需要你们的支持。
The leaflets of the NLD!

412
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:39,490
各就各位。
Everyone is in place.

413
00:42:45,949 --> 00:43:07,490
全国民主联盟！
National League for Democracy!

414
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:13,699
我们的第一张大字报。
First Statement

415
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:17,782
混账！
I understood.

416
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,407
Sein Lwin，你懂的。
Sein Lwin, you know what to do.

417
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:24,282
请首长放心，保证完成任务。
Yes, Sir.

418
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,449
我们走。
Let's go.

419
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:31,491
我们必须联合各少数民族，
It must meet all minorities,

420
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:34,032
但很多民族都藏在大山深处，很难联系。
Myitkjina
but is lost in the mountains.

421
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,157
没有所有人的参与，民主就名不符实。
Democracy will only work if we include everybody.

422
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,408
土匪来了！
They are coming!

她说她暂时不走。

不，怕什么，不过是外强中干罢了。
No, do not pay attention to them.

492
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:18,339
我只管过去，看他们能把我怎么样。
We will continue peacefully.

493
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,548
你们先待在这。
Stay there first.

494
00:53:25,008 --> 00:53:28,257
后退！这是命令！
Go home! That's an order!

495
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:37,215
再不站住我就开枪了。

I will open fire!

496
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:10,674

这世界上有什么是比一个将军更危险的东西吗？
What is more dangerous than a general ?

506
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:21,801
两个将军。

00:55:33,261 --> 00:55:34,051
那么，

是你主动救了她，是吗？

你们今天都有机会上一课。

她父亲成了烈士，成了我们挥之不去的梦魇。
His father, the martyr,
was a constant threat to us.

518
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:19,386
如果再出现一个烈士，我们都受不了。
We can not afford a second martyr.

519
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:21,344
不要莽撞行事。

520
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:31,678
无本之木活不了多久，
The tree whose roots have been cut

521
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:34,970
她蹦跶不了几天了。

面对威权政府变本加厉的恫吓，

It is essential that us to fulfill this peacefully,

529
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,346
我们必须把这无休止的纷争彻底抛进历史的垃圾桶。
without further loss of lives.

530
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:41,054

你呢，
Do not you, U Win Tin?

534
00:58:27,724 --> 00:58:30,056
昂山女士，我们每去一个地方，
Daw Suu, everywhere we went,

535
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:32,431
他们就在那随便抓人。
they were arrested and taken people.

536
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:36,098
他们都被抓到什么地方了？
where were they taking?

537
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:40,348
有的被抓去边境劳改

走私武器毒品。
for the generals.

540
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:49,556
其他人呢？
And the others?

541
00:59:31,308 --> 00:59:32,724
我们应该给联合国和大赦国际写信，
We should write to the UN

542
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:36,349
告诉他们，

543

00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,933
亲爱的，
My darling,

547
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:53,642
为了维护他们摇摇欲坠的统治，
Every day new atrocities

548
00:59:54,184 --> 00:59:59,600
地狱的种种天天在这里上演。

549
00:59:59,851 --> 01:00:01,975
但你不能回来。
But you can not go back.

550
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:05,600
正如父亲所说，
As my father said:

551
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:08,350
做最好的准备，同时做最坏的打算。
while preparing for the worst. "

552
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:12,892
所以亲爱的，我请求你尽量别去担心。
So, darling, please,I beg you,try ur best not to worry.

01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:49,893
久仰。
Of course!

565
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,643
你妻子的成就引人注目。
I like to watch your wife's progress
with admiration.

566
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:55,269
很抱歉打扰您。
Sorry to trouble you,

567
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:59,477
我猜您对诺贝尔和平奖评选委员会有一定影响力。
I think you have some influence
with the Nobel Peace Prize Committee.

568
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:02,810
您能帮她提名吗？
I was wandering if you be willing to forward her name?

569
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:05,644
她绝对够资格。
His candidacy is very solid.

570
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:09,435
任何提高她国际声誉的东西
Anything that reinforces its international reputation

571
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:13,060
都能对她提供一定的保护。
contributes in some way to protect.

572
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,394
您应该理解，
You can imagine,
the question of its safety

573
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:17,935
她的安全对我来说胜过一切。
weigh myself a lot.

574
01:01:18,103 --> 01:01:20,769
你有她的简历吗？
DO u have some kind of CV

575
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:25,060
我可以向诺贝尔委员会递交申请。
I will present to Vaclav Havel and his Committee.

576
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:27,810
您帮了我一个大忙。
It would we very helpful.

577
01:01:28,395 --> 01:01:29,769
您知道吗？
You see,

578
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:34,144
每一天我都在担心，运气会悄悄溜走。
everyday I tell myself that luck could abandon.

579
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:36,186
我尽力吧。
I will do my best.

580
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:38,395
感激不尽。
Thank you very much.

581
01:01:42,354 --> 01:01:45,395
Karma，我正找你呢，跟我来。

Follow me.

582
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:47,686
Aris教授，我还得……
Dr Aris, I must...

583
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,436
我需要你的帮助
I need you.

584
01:01:49,604 --> 01:01:52,895
我制定了一份行动计划，
Instead of sitting down and worry about the election date,

585
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:56,603
而不是坐在这守株待兔。
I concocted a plan of action.
I have here somewhere

586
01:01:56,771 --> 01:01:58,936
这里有些昂山素季的资料。
all dissertations Suu .

587
01:01:59,104 --> 01:02:01,020
包括介绍她父亲的
Including one of his father

588
01:02:01,187 --> 01:02:03,353
以及缅甸殖民时代的一些资料。
and on colonial Burma.

589
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:07,103
你整理一下看能不能找出点什么。
Read all of this
and see what you can get.

590
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:11,103
我们要为昂山素季申报诺贝尔和平奖。
We will nominate Suu
the Nobel Prize.

591
01:02:12,022 --> 01:02:12,979
给力。
It's great.

592
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:14,354
确实给力。
Yes.

593
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:17,562
快开始吧，让我们拭目以待。
Good. You can start!
We'll see what happens.

594
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:24,146
好兄弟。
Good man.

595
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,688
可能用处不大，但我还是要尽我所能来保护你。
It will not help
I tell you to preserve you,

596
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:30,148
时刻保持谨慎，
but please,
remains judicious in all things.

597
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:31,981
你必须选好时机。
You have to choose the right time.

598
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:35,689
因为深深地爱着你，
If your husband loves you deeply
still has some authority over you,

599
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:38,064
我冒昧地认为自己有权要求你这么做。
so listen to me, I pray.

600
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:42,481
像我爱你那样爱自己好吗？
Be as gentle with  yourself
as I would if I was there.

601
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,856
爹！
Dad!

602
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,981
一惊一乍地，一点都不稳重！
Warning!

603
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,731
天哪！
Oh goodness!

604
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,231
我们可以提前过年了。
Looks like the Christmas comes early.

605
01:04:16,858 --> 01:04:19,149
Kim，轻点。
Kim, watch out, finally!

606
01:04:19,316 --> 01:04:20,940
是哦，看你多完美啊！
Yes, my brother in perfect!

607
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:31,274
是。
Yes.

608
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:35,524
什么？
What?

609
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:40,190
怎么会！
Oh no!

610
01:04:40,941 --> 01:04:42,024
好。
Yes.

611
01:04:42,734 --> 01:04:43,941
对不住。
I'm sorry.

612
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:47,858
一会再打给你。
Lucinda, I will call you later.

613
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:50,650
好。再见。
OK. Goodbye.

614
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:54,983
爹？
Dad?

615
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,400
是Lucinda阿姨。
That was your Aunt Lucinda.

616
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,275
很不幸，你们的爷爷走了。
I'm sorry to have to tell u
your grandfather died.

617
01:05:06,817 --> 01:05:09,400
我得回苏格兰去主持葬礼。
I have to go to Scotland to organize the funeral.

618
01:05:38,277 --> 01:05:40,692
被提名诺贝尔和平奖的缅甸人
Burmese tipped for Peace Prize

619
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,859
大家都听着，
I'll tell you.

620
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:48,192
我们必须切断这个女人的一切外部联系，
This woman must be isolated

621
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:50,817
不管是国内，
all those who support it.

622
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:53,942
还是国外。
As to isolate the world...

623
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,359
首长？
Head?

624
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,484
属下倒有一计不知当讲不当讲。
I have an idea on the issue.

625
01:05:59,236 --> 01:05:59,985
说吧。
Continue.

626
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:03,735
只要让我全权负责，
Give me the reins.

627
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:07,860
其它的事首长就不用担心了。
I can make it be forgotten,
here and elsewhere.

628
01:06:11,986 --> 01:06:12,860
说个数字。
Tell a figure.

629
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:14,152
5。
（注：吴奈温极为迷信，有很强烈的数字崇拜情结）
5.

630
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:30,527
你先下去吧。
Sein Lwin , you may have.

631
01:06:34,444 --> 01:06:35,068
现在，
Now

632
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,278
你直接对我负责，
you alone make me accountable.

633
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,653
这件事就完全交给你了。
You have carte blanche
to solve this problem.

634
01:06:41,987 --> 01:06:44,069
- Count Me In.   -您就瞧好吧。
- Good.          -等你的好消息。

635
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:30,779
起床了！
Good morning!

636
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:34,445
太阳都晒屁股了。
It's time to wake up.

637
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:38,945
起床了！
Good morning!

638
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,029
睡醒了吗？
Sleep well?

639
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:47,654
孩子，
Now

640
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:49,445
别怕。
I do not want u to be frightened,

641
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:53,487
今天一大早，这帮土匪就搅扰了我们的清梦
but this morning we have wake woken to find the
house is surrounded by soldiers.

642
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,613
有可能什么都不会发生，
There is perhaps nothing will.

643
01:07:57,156 --> 01:08:00,613
但万一我被抓走了，
But in case I am arrested, I
arranged

644
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:01,780
我会争取让你们遣返回国。
for your repatriation.

645
01:08:02,197 --> 01:08:04,946
我向你们保证，无论发生什么，
I want you to know that whatever happens,

646
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:08,196
都会有人好好照顾你们的，好吗？
you will be well taken care of. Alright?

647
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:10,280
好吧。
Yes.

648
01:08:27,697 --> 01:08:29,613
昂山素季，你被逮捕了。
Aung San Suu Kyi, you are officially

649
01:08:29,782 --> 01:08:32,156
除了你的孩子，
Arrest. Apart from your children,

650
01:08:32,323 --> 01:08:34,031
其他人通通离开。

651
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,531
都回去吧，路上一定要小心。
Enter quickly at home,
as discreetly as possible.

652
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:45,364
快走！

653
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:46,697
快！

通通带走，不要留下一份文件。
Take everything.
Not allow any document here.

658
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:37,532
书也通通带走。
Drain the library.

659
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:49,574
我们逗你玩呢。
These are my jokes.

660
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,491
只不过好像没怎么把你逗乐。
They do not make you laugh, that's it.

661
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:19,241
带着妹妹去找你爹，快去。
Take the small and will find your father.
Go, dark!

662
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:27,992
文件通通带走。
Take all folders.

663
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:37,075
好吧。
Yes, I understand.

664
01:10:37,243 --> 01:10:40,617
缅甸是切断了全国所有的电话，还是只切断了这一部？
But all the lines are cut in Burmese,
or just this one?

665
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:43,325
I see，just this one.
好，就这一部。

666
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:44,867
谢了
Thank you.

667
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,867
lnsein——缅甸最大监狱

停，过来跟着我。
Hi,stop.Follow me!

669
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,744

也得遵守

671
01:12:16,328 --> 01:12:19,786
我们对你妻子的禁令

672
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:22,953
不得接触外国使领馆

673
01:12:23,163 --> 01:12:25,912
以及任何政治活动分子。

674
01:12:28,746 --> 01:12:29,870
都清楚了吗？
Is that understood?

675
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:31,703
清楚。
Yes.

676
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:35,037
享受这儿的一切吧。
Enjoy your stay!

677
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,496
想吃巧克力吗？可惜我们没有。
Chocolate? We don't have it.

678
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:09,954
孩子们！
Boys!

679
01:13:11,205 --> 01:13:12,329
爹？
Dad?

680
01:13:18,705 --> 01:13:19,788
其他人呢？
Where are the others?

681
01:13:20,914 --> 01:13:22,288
俺娘绝食了，正躺着呢。

682
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:24,579
绝食？

01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:34,914
他爹。

684

他们一大早过来抓走好多人
They came early in the morning and arrested
my colleagues,

685
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:44,580
我却还被软禁在这。
but I am under house arrest.

686
01:13:44,748 --> 01:13:46,830
除非我也被抓进监狱，
I know that I will not eat

687
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:49,330
不然我就绝食到底。
until I put in prison too.

688
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,205
- They cut the phone line.   -他们断了电话。
- With scissors!        -剪掉了。

689
01:13:53,456 --> 01:13:54,414
你难以想象
You can not imagine

690
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:56,455
你能来我有多高兴。
my relief that you're here.

691
01:13:56,873 --> 01:13:58,205
你最后一次是什么时候吃的饭？

692
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:00,080
三天前吧。

家里从没这么沉闷过。
It is never a dull moment in this family.

695
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:09,622
我能做点什么吗？
What do I do with you?

696
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,166
全世界都在担心
Fears are growing

697
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:08,207
英国科学家Aris教授的安危。
about the fate of Professor Aris, a British academic

698
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,666
两周前，

699
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,332
他去仰光探望自己的妻子昂山素季，
It has not been seen since his arrival in
Rangoon

700
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,999
从那以后就再也没有人见过他。
to visit his wife Aung San Suu Kyi.

701
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,541
尽管政府数次向缅甸当局表示严重关切，
The Department has called for new
urgently

702
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:25,166
但缅甸当局始终拒绝回答
but the Burmese authorities refuse to say

703
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,999
他的行踪及安危。
if he's okay and where he is.

704
01:15:28,168 --> 01:15:32,458
据英国大使馆透露，我们现在仅仅知道……
According to the British Embassy, ​​
the only thing we know is that...

705
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:56,292
娃他娘，
Listen, Suu.

706
01:15:57,084 --> 01:15:58,542
如果你不在了，
If you die,

707
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:01,500
孩子们就没了娘，
the boys lose their mother

708
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:04,833
这片土地上的人民也会没了最后的希望。
and your people,their best defender.

709
01:16:05,585 --> 01:16:07,001
我能做点什么吗？
Can I try something?

710
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:08,918
什么？
What?

711
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:27,334
乖乖坐下。
Sit.

712
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:48,794
起立。
Standing.

713
01:16:54,628 --> 01:16:57,794
我有话要说。
I wish put a proposition.

714
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:01,294
我妻子绝食
It's been 12 days

715
01:17:01,461 --> 01:17:03,335
已经12天了。
since my wife has not eaten anything.

716
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:05,919
我不得不告诉你们
I must tell you

717
01:17:06,086 --> 01:17:09,002
她的身体状况有多么糟糕。
how vey rapidly her hearlth is decline.

718
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,585
她可以
She is prepared

719
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:14,752
放弃绝食，
to abondon her hunger strike,

720
01:17:15,753 --> 01:17:18,544
只要你们能够保证
if you will offer her a formal assurance

721
01:17:19,045 --> 01:17:21,127
给予她的同仁以人道待遇。
that her colleagues will be well treated.

722
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:24,836
她生命的垂危程度已经无法用语言形容，
I cannot emphasize the great danger she is.

723
01:17:25,004 --> 01:17:28,461
最多还能挺一两天。
She will not survive more than a day or two.

724
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:32,878
我提醒你们注意
I ask you to consider very carefully

725
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:37,211
拖下去的严重后果。
the public consequences if you failed to act quickly.

726
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,586
夫人，政府向您保证
Authorities give you the assurance

727
01:17:56,879 --> 01:17:59,461
不伤害您的同事。
no harm to your colleagues.

728
01:18:07,422 --> 01:18:08,504
可以了吗？
All right?

729
01:18:43,173 --> 01:18:46,255
昂山素季很关心你的安危嘛，
Aung San Suu Kyi is worried about you, apparently.

730
01:18:46,423 --> 01:18:48,297
乖，吃得白白胖胖的啊。
Here, eat.

731
01:19:47,174 --> 01:19:48,923
什么声音。
What is that noise?

732
01:19:57,008 --> 01:19:58,174
这就是传说中的
It's called...

733
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:01,215
音乐。
Music.

734
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:15,840
长这么大以来，就这周过得最极品了。
I spent the week
the strangest of my life.

735
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:19,382
这几天多谢了。
Thank you for everything.

736
01:20:20,008 --> 01:20:22,382
没有你我挺不过这段日子
I could not get this through without you.

737
01:20:23,175 --> 01:20:24,465
你走了，这里又要空荡荡的了。
The house will be quiet.

738
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,257
无论你在哪里，
I know. I will continue

739
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:28,299
我都只离你一个转身的距离，
waving the red rag.

740
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,757
我会一直支持着你，直到我们看到胜利的曙光。
So long as we quickly tunnel.

741
01:20:31,592 --> 01:20:34,466
我一定会好好的，Mikey。别担心。
I'm okay, Mikey. Do not worry.

742
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:36,175
照顾好孩子们。
Ta priority, it is boys.

743
01:20:36,342 --> 01:20:37,466
我懂的。
I know.

744
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:31,509
缅甸政府正式宣布于五月进行全民公投。
The Burmese authorities have announced that the
ballot would be held in May.

745
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:34,634
遗憾的是，依据一条不起眼的法律，
However, Aung San Suu Kyi
was not authorized

746
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:37,384
如果配偶为外籍人士，
to be a candidate in elections

747
01:21:37,552 --> 01:21:39,051
就不得竞选缅甸总统，
under an obscure law

748
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:43,134
所以昂山素季被禁止参选。
prohibiting the President of Burma
to have a foreign spouse.

749
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:46,926
明白。
I understand.

750
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:49,218
就这样吧。
Okay.

751
01:21:50,136 --> 01:21:51,385
拜拜。
Bye.

752
01:21:55,386 --> 01:21:58,385
- What call brutal!   -去他妈的。
- Who was that?       -谁啊。

753
01:21:58,761 --> 01:21:59,718
大使馆。
The Embassy.

754
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:04,093
他们说孩子们不再符合条件，
Boys
no longer meet the conditions of Burmese nationality.

755
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:07,093
所以他们的护照要被取消了。
Their passports are invalidated .

756
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:09,010
难以置信。
It is beyond comprehension.

757
01:22:10,178 --> 01:22:13,927
他们觉得把昂山素季和孩子们分开
They decided that preventing Suu
to see her children

758
01:22:14,094 --> 01:22:16,135
就能让她知难而退。
was an effective way of breaking it.

759
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:20,385
至少他们答应公投了，
At least they hold elections.

760
01:22:20,678 --> 01:22:21,843
让我们拭目以待，
Wait and see.

761
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:25,135
希望一切都能好起来。
Hopefully everything is resolved soon.

762
01:22:25,304 --> 01:22:26,803
但愿吧。
Yes, hope.

763
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:29,636
我们唯一无法被剥夺的就是我们的希望。
We all cling to hope.

764
01:22:32,804 --> 01:22:36,053
对缅甸民众来说，这曾经是难以置信的，
This is a day that few people in Burma ever imagined

765
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,261
无法想象这居然可以在这个国家成为现实
Across the country,
incredible scenes.

766
01:22:39,429 --> 01:22:42,178
数千民众在四十多年来的第一次选举中
We press their thousands to vote

767
01:22:42,345 --> 01:22:44,553
踊跃投票
first elections in 40 years.

768
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,678
据初步统计，
The first estimates are falling...

769
01:22:47,845 --> 01:22:49,844
昂山素季
Aung San Suu Kyi

770
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,761
获得392票
392 seats.

771
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:52,928
军事当局，
The Burma military

772
01:22:53,095 --> 01:22:54,178
10票。
10 seats.

773
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,011
她赢了！
She won!

774
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,011
谢天谢地！
Oh my God!

775
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:04,554
太棒了。
It's great!

776
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:05,554
缅甸全国上下
In Burma ,

777
01:23:05,721 --> 01:23:08,720
掀起了一场昂山素季风潮。
it's a tidal wave extraordinary
for Aung San Suu Kyi

778
01:23:08,888 --> 01:23:10,929
她所在的党派，
and her party, the National League

779
01:23:11,096 --> 01:23:12,387
全国民主联盟也随之成为焦点。
for Democracy.

780
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:15,762
在一个禁止超过5人以上聚集的国家，
In a country where
gatherings of more than 5 persons are prohibited,

781
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:18,720
很显然，全民盟
NLD party seems

782
01:23:18,888 --> 01:23:21,929
要为其胜利而狂欢了。
to celebrate his victory to the end of the night.

783
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:53,388
来，把花插上。
I'll put flowers in their hair.

784
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:13,680
公投最终结果
Final vote result

785
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:16,888
看，你们看！
Check this out!

786
01:24:17,056 --> 01:24:19,305
那个疯婆子赢了。
This woman won.

787
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:21,931
混账！
This is absurd!

788
01:24:23,307 --> 01:24:24,681
把电话给我！
Bring the phone!

789
01:24:44,015 --> 01:24:45,347
站住！
Stop!

790
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,306
赶快给我回去！
Go back immediately!

791
01:24:53,098 --> 01:24:54,722
说你呢，没听见吗？
Stop. Go back!

792
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,722
拜托不要这么幼稚好吗，我只是去和简单他们说几句。
Don't be silly. I just want to talk to them.
Do not be ridiculous.

793
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:01,848
- I'll talk to them.             -滚开。
- I have the authority to shoot. -你再敢前进一步我就开枪了。

794
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:03,390
有种你开。
You will not shoot.

795
01:25:19,683 --> 01:25:21,223
给我回去！
Go back home!

796
01:25:48,934 --> 01:25:50,683
请坐。
Take a sit.

797
01:25:53,892 --> 01:25:56,391
公投已经结束，
Now that the elections were held,

798
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:59,308
我有好消息要告诉你。
I have good news for you.

799
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:03,391
当局想和你们达成共识,
Authorities are willing to find arrangement.

800
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:05,974
只要你写信给你妻子，
If you write to your wife

801
01:26:06,142 --> 01:26:10,433
让她尽快回牛津
to encourage her to return to Oxford to live
faster,

802
01:26:11,017 --> 01:26:14,433
他们可以准予你们早日团聚。
they will empower you from there.

803
01:26:15,476 --> 01:26:16,600
知道了。
I see.

804
01:26:18,393 --> 01:26:20,975
不过我认为完全没有必要
Since I have no intention

805
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:23,725
写这样一封信，
to ask such a thing to my wife,

806
01:26:23,893 --> 01:26:25,017
所以我的回去了。
I'll take my leave.

807
01:26:36,018 --> 01:26:39,059
这群狗杂种，
Those bastards will stop at nothing!

808
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,059
无法无天。
If they hope that I will flatten,
they will be surprised.

809
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:45,309
我们走。
Let's go.

810
01:26:51,394 --> 01:26:53,226
尽管竞选失败，
Despite their crushing defeat,

811
01:26:54,186 --> 01:26:58,476
缅甸军事当局仍然囚禁昂山素季
Burmese junta still do not release
Aung San Suu Kyi

812
01:26:58,644 --> 01:27:01,185
使她无法在选举成功后顺利就任。
taking office as prime minister-elect.

813
01:27:02,977 --> 01:27:05,393
她依然被软禁，
She is still confined  home

814
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:09,518
同时，她所在的党派——全民盟的
while leaders of his party, the NLD,

815
01:27:09,686 --> 01:27:11,060
主要成员接连被捕。
are arrested one after the other.

816
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:16,226
由于僧侣发起抗议活动，
The monks launched a protest movement

817
01:27:16,394 --> 01:27:19,185
目前众多寺庙被军管。
and monasteries were stormed by the army.

818
01:27:37,228 --> 01:27:39,269
我向您保证，Aris教授
I assure you, Professor Aris

819
01:27:39,437 --> 01:27:41,769
我们会尽全力，
we do our best.

820
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:44,394
不幸的是
However, we believe

821
01:27:44,562 --> 01:27:47,269
对缅甸的经济制裁计划，
that by imposing economic sanctions against Burma

822
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:49,477
被敏感词否决。（自己意会吧）
with only plaint of hand of Beijing

823
01:27:49,645 --> 01:27:53,436
他们利用这次机会来加强自己
They will seize this opportunity to tighten their economic stranglehold

824
01:27:53,603 --> 01:27:54,477
对缅甸政府的影响力。
on Rangoon.

825
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,102
我还有个重要会议，
Now forgive me I have an important meeting to geet to,

826
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:00,186
祝您好运。
and I wish you all the best of luck,sir.

827
01:28:34,438 --> 01:28:35,145
Finnis教授。
Pr Finnis.

828
01:28:35,438 --> 01:28:38,020
- How are you?        -最近怎么样？
- I've been better.   -马马虎虎。

829
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,603
我猜你听完我说的就不是马马虎虎了。
I think what I have to say
will cheer you up.

830
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:51,646
我和孩子们此刻的喜悦与自豪中
The joy and pride I and my children feel this moments,

831
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:55,438
还夹杂着一丝悲伤和担忧。
are tinged with sadness and apprehension.

832
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:59,396
我不知道是否曾经有过这样被
I'm not sure if the Nobel Peace Prize has ever been given to

833
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:03,146
严密监禁的诺贝尔和平奖获得者。
someone in the situation of such extreme isolation before.

834
01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:07,521
我只知道从来没有过如此的女性获得者。
And I know he was never given to
a woman in this situation.

835
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:11,646
由于政治上的原因，
This will do three years that Suu
is detained for political reasons

836
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:13,729
她一直都被军事当局软禁。
by the military regime.

837
01:29:14,022 --> 01:29:17,646
即使作为她的家人，我们也毫无她的音信。
We, her family,
have no contact with her.

838
01:29:17,814 --> 01:29:19,813
除了她很孤独外，
The only thing we know,

839
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,396
我们一无所知。
is that she's all alone.

840
01:29:23,565 --> 01:29:25,980
出于私心，
I hope selfishly

841
01:29:26,148 --> 01:29:28,522
我对经济上的改善也感到高兴，
that our situation will become more liveable

842
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:31,939
至少会让家庭状况好很多，
as the result of this supreme conditions

843
01:29:32,106 --> 01:29:34,939
这也算是对她身心伤害的补偿吧。
for her moral and physical courage,

844
01:29:35,106 --> 01:29:38,897
同时希望我们得到探望她的机会。
And that we will finally have the right to report
visit again.

我和孩子们都很想她。
We miss her very much.

846
01:29:45,356 --> 01:29:47,064
我也想你们。

如果你娘可以收听广播的话，
If your mother has access to a radio,

850
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:03,023
能够听到你们的声音会让她深受鼓舞。

We are in Oslo,the BBC World Service brings you the Nobel Price…
这里是奥斯陆，BBC在为您实时报导诺贝尔和平……

855
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:27,650
停电了。
There is no power!

856
01:31:27,818 --> 01:31:28,817
连广播都听不了了。
We no longer have the radio!

857
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:32,358
没事，别担心，我去看看。

昂山素季。

866
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,110
幸好还有个收音机！
I have another radio!

867
01:32:38,278 --> 01:32:39,360
快！快！

现在有请年轻的Alexander Aris，

873
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:18,861
代表我的母亲——昂山素季

874
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:22,570

the best reward,
the Nobel Prize for Peace .

875
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:26,986
由于众所周知的原因她不能亲自前来，
Because circumstances prevented her from joining us,

876
01:33:27,154 --> 01:33:31,320
只能由我在这里，尝试说出她的心声
I will try to say what she wants
probably express.

877
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:35,736
我们必须铭记，
We must remember that the lonely struggle

878
01:33:35,904 --> 01:33:39,528
一个柔弱的女性，独自一人在重重监视之下不懈奋斗，
that takes place in a ownership
under surveillance in Rangoon

879
01:33:39,987 --> 01:33:44,028
这是全世界人民
fits in the global fight
for Shipping

880
01:33:44,446 --> 01:33:45,736
反抗暴政和一切真理部的斗争中，
of the human mind

881
01:33:45,904 --> 01:33:48,570
一个小小的缩影。
of political tyranny and oppression psychological.

882
01:33:52,655 --> 01:33:55,404
对历史的铭记，
Lessons from the past
will not be forgotten.

883
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:57,946
指引我们前进的方向。
but it's also for the future

884
01:33:58,113 --> 01:34:00,154
我相信，我们的未来必将是一片光明。
that we celebrate today.

885
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:49,280
什么屌声音？
What is that noise?

886
01:34:50,489 --> 01:34:51,613
这叫音乐。
From music.

887
01:36:02,325 --> 01:36:05,324
这下老贼不得不退位了。
The old generals
will be forced to yield.

888
01:36:05,658 --> 01:36:07,407
无非是时间长短而已。
This is a matter of time.

889
01:36:07,575 --> 01:36:09,365
但愿如此。
Yes, I hope.

890
01:36:09,533 --> 01:36:11,574
让我们拭目以待，
Let's see what happens.

891
01:36:11,741 --> 01:36:14,199
看看他们还有没有别的伎俩。
Pathways military
are impenetrable.

892
01:36:14,491 --> 01:36:16,282
你母亲肯定会为你而骄傲的。
Your mother would be very proud of you.

893
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:17,115
谢谢。
Thank you.

894
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:17,907
精彩！

01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:25,871
No,no,no,no,no…
哦，你们不行

896
01:36:26,701 --> 01:36:28,200
为什么不行？
Why not?

897
01:36:30,867 --> 01:36:32,033
好吧，随你们好了。

3年后

901
01:36:46,326 --> 01:36:50,033
把鞋脱了，别把泥带进屋。

I do not want mud in the house.

902
01:36:52,534 --> 01:36:56,450
晚饭七点半吃，Anthony叔叔要来。
The dinners later tonight, at 19:30.
Uncle Anthony is coming around.

903
01:37:03,035 --> 01:37:04,284
怎么了？
What's wrong?

904
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:07,909
我想我娘了。
I miss Mom.

905
01:37:37,828 --> 01:37:39,452
远离恐惧的自由
Freedom from fear

艺术是思维的镜像。
"The art of a people
is a true mirror of their minds."

909
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,328
新来的吧？
Is it a new face?

910
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:49,786
你叫什么？
What is your name?

911
01:38:52,955 --> 01:38:54,620
懂英语吗？
Can you speak English?

912
01:38:57,788 --> 01:38:59,370
你叫什么名字？
So what is your name?

913
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:01,829
Arun。
Arun.

914
01:39:04,955 --> 01:39:07,912
过来，给你看点东西。
Come here.
Let's me show you something.

915
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:16,620
我不吃人，别怕。
It's alright, I do not bite.

916
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,037
“你可以不关心政治，

917
01:39:23,246 --> 01:39:25,037
但政治肯定会关心你。”

918
01:39:25,288 --> 01:39:27,245
我父亲说的。

你站那的时候可以想想。

920
01:39:36,831 --> 01:39:38,496
你能抽出时间来见我，
Eminence , thank you

921
01:39:38,664 --> 01:39:40,663
我荣幸之至。

922
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:44,580
亲，我每天都会想起昂山素季。

923
01:39:44,747 --> 01:39:47,621
但愿我们能多做点什么。

希望你能给我带来好消息。

925
01:39:50,831 --> 01:39:54,330
抱歉，不过情况还是几乎没变。
No, sorry,
but the situation has hardly changed.

926
01:39:54,497 --> 01:39:58,330
那独夫民贼完全不理会
The fact is that the generals
scoff that the United States

927
01:39:58,497 --> 01:40:00,538
美欧诸国的关切。
and Europe condemn their action.

928
01:40:00,831 --> 01:40:03,830
没有某些亚洲国家的支持，
Asian Without support, I doubt

929
01:40:03,997 --> 01:40:05,788
我很怀疑我们能否获得进展。
we make progress.

930
01:40:05,956 --> 01:40:08,496
对不起我还有事。
Excuse me.

931
01:40:09,748 --> 01:40:10,456
朋友们，
My Friends.

932
01:40:10,998 --> 01:40:12,122
您好。
Hello!

933
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:14,997
耽误你们几分钟可以吗？
I want to annoy
few moments.

934
01:40:15,582 --> 01:40:17,456
很高兴与您再会。
It is a pleasure to see you again.

935
01:40:23,082 --> 01:40:24,372
东盟组织
The Asian Nations South East

936
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,956
对你们要求加入的申请
have carefully studied your request

937
01:40:27,123 --> 01:40:28,622
进行磋商。
to join our association.

938
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:30,414
最终，
At the end of all,

939
01:40:31,082 --> 01:40:33,122
决定接受你们成为我们中的一分子。
we are quite favorable.

940
01:40:33,457 --> 01:40:36,247
很高兴听到这个消息。我们应该共同举杯庆祝这一好消息。
I am enchanted. We should made a toast!

941
01:40:38,582 --> 01:40:42,872
然而虽然我们和美欧国家有一些冲突
But although the U.S. and Europe are our competitors,

942
01:40:43,123 --> 01:40:46,122
我们还是不得不和他们保持良好关系。
we depend on their goodwill.

943
01:40:49,916 --> 01:40:52,623
我们只是需要时间，
Democracy takes time to implement.

944
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:55,248
民主不是一夜建成的。
It is not done overnight.

945
01:40:55,499 --> 01:40:56,790
我们理解。
We understand.

946
01:40:56,958 --> 01:41:00,123
但你至少得做点样子出来。
It would be fashionable
you make a gesture.

947
01:41:01,166 --> 01:41:02,998
还请不吝赐教。
What kind of gesture?

948
01:41:04,964 --> 01:41:09,973
内政部长找您。
（相当于公安部，现任缅甸内政部长名字叫“哥哥”，
前段时间访华很是拉风）
The police chief is
here to see you.

949
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:21,415
您的监禁已经被正式解除。
Your house arrest is lifted.

950
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:25,207
从现在起，您可以自由行动了。
You are free to come and go as you please.

951
01:42:28,793 --> 01:42:29,417
是你吗？真的是你吗？
Is that you?

952
01:42:29,585 --> 01:42:33,000
你可能不会相信，但我现在确实是在英国大使馆给你打电话。
You will not believe it, but
I call the embassy.

953
01:42:33,168 --> 01:42:34,000
我自由了。
I am free.

954
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:35,417
告诉孩子们，
Tell the boys

955
01:42:35,585 --> 01:42:36,375
我自由了。
I am free.

956
01:42:38,126 --> 01:42:40,084
难以置信！
I can't believe this!

957
01:42:40,294 --> 01:42:42,168
我的同志们也都自由了。
ALL My colleagues also were released.

958
01:42:42,502 --> 01:42:45,668
如果我快点，我明天……
If I hurry, I can succeed

959
01:42:45,836 --> 01:42:47,335
明天就能见到你了。
to be with you tomorrow.

960
01:42:47,502 --> 01:42:48,710
明天将是值得纪念的一天。
Tomorrow will be a big day.

961
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:50,168
多么令人期待的一天！
A wonderful day!

962
01:42:50,336 --> 01:42:54,126
我想再开一次全民盟会议。
I hope to reorganize
a meeting of the NLD.

963
01:42:54,377 --> 01:42:56,168
我人生中数一数二的幸运日。
One of the happiest days of my life.

964
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,835
最好明天早上我们就能见面
I hope we'll meet tomorrow morning.

965
01:42:58,086 --> 01:43:01,501
我马上订票，最好是明天，
I'll call the airport .
It may be tomorrow.

966
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:02,668
尽可能快吧。
But very soon!

967
01:43:03,544 --> 01:43:05,793
我们的斗争可以继续了
Because the fight goes on.

968
01:43:06,002 --> 01:43:06,793
继续什么？
What goes on?

969
01:43:07,294 --> 01:43:09,085
继续我们的斗争。
The fight goes on.

970
01:43:33,378 --> 01:43:35,044
圣女——在等待
Lady in waiting

971
01:44:18,338 --> 01:44:21,003
从没见过你如此活力四射
I've never seen her so radiant.

972
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:23,003
真高兴你们能来。
I'm glad you're here.

973
01:44:25,254 --> 01:44:25,920
娘。
Hello, Mom.

974
01:44:26,129 --> 01:44:27,462
Alexander!
Alexander!

975
01:44:28,129 --> 01:44:30,170
当年的那个小孩子哪去了？
Where is my young boy?

976
01:44:33,297 --> 01:44:35,338
能再次见到你们真是太高兴了。
So wonderful to see you again!

977
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,338
昂山女士，我们必须抓紧！
Daw Suu, we need to go!

978
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:41,463
很快回来。
I did not for long.

979
01:44:41,839 --> 01:44:42,713
去吧。
Go.

980
01:44:55,714 --> 01:44:56,796
爹。

981
01:45:10,089 --> 01:45:11,463
你在这！
There you are!

982
01:45:12,548 --> 01:45:14,297
我到处找你。
I've been looking everywhere.

983
01:45:14,465 --> 01:45:16,005
你懂的，不管你身在何处，
You know me.

984
01:45:16,465 --> 01:45:18,047
我和你之间都只有一个转身的距离。
never very far.

985
01:45:19,631 --> 01:45:23,297
多少次，我渴望着，能够再次就这样将你拥入怀中。
Many years ago I expected
hold you in my arms.

986
01:45:24,923 --> 01:45:27,130
每当回想起你的种种
I can not stop pinching myself.

987
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:31,589
我都克制不住地掐自己。我止不住地去想你在做什么。
When I thought of you,
I imagined what you were doing.

988
01:45:31,798 --> 01:45:34,755
我曾不止一次说过,
Often I told you,
Sometimes aloud.

989
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:37,839
你总是能让我安下心来,
You always make me reassured.

990
01:45:38,006 --> 01:45:40,089
总是温暖着我，因为茫茫人海中，有一个人，这么深沉地爱着我。
You remembered me your unfailing love.

991
01:45:42,256 --> 01:45:45,505
现在全世界都把你当作圣人。
You are aware that the world wants
beatify you.

992
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,422
可是我只是这大千世界中再平凡不过的一份子。
The cult of personality
does not interest me much.

993
01:45:49,591 --> 01:45:52,965
圣人，不过是不懈奋斗的罪人罢了。
A saint, this is just a sinner who keeps on trying.

994
01:45:53,132 --> 01:45:55,006
你还有什么缺点吗？
What are your faults?

995
01:45:55,299 --> 01:45:56,631
你真忘了吗？
You forgot?

996
01:45:56,799 --> 01:46:00,423
常常突然发怒，缺乏耐心。
My tantrums, my impatience.

997
01:46:01,257 --> 01:46:02,465
还有，我一直都很固执。
And I am stubborn.

998
01:46:03,049 --> 01:46:04,548
我都知道。
I know.

999
01:46:07,757 --> 01:46:10,756
最近对你的赞美铺天盖地，
I've read good things about you,
anyway.

1000
01:46:11,424 --> 01:46:13,965
“女中曼德拉”“缅甸之星”
"The Female Mandela",
"The Star of Burma".

1001
01:46:14,466 --> 01:46:17,131
我最喜欢的一个是时代杂志上的，
My favorite is the one the Times.

1002
01:46:17,299 --> 01:46:19,048
在一张美丽的照片下面
A beautiful picture of you

1003
01:46:20,174 --> 01:46:23,256
写着“钢铁玫瑰”
and below,
the title "The Steel Orchid".

1004
01:46:26,925 --> 01:46:28,966
那你怎么看我？
How you see me?

1005
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:35,216
站着你的面前，我的大脑就停止思考了。
Well,seeing you,I did not see much,
recently.

1006
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:41,966
如果你想要轻松的生活，
If you want your freedom back...

1007
01:46:45,425 --> 01:46:47,091
尽管去过。
Just start it again...

1008
01:46:47,633 --> 01:46:49,216
如果你要这么做，
I want you to know

1009
01:46:49,383 --> 01:46:51,174
我会理解的。
I understand that.

1010
01:46:52,592 --> 01:46:53,799
听着。
Look.

1011
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,132
我承认，长期分离很痛苦。
I will not deny that this long separation
is heavy.

1012
01:46:58,383 --> 01:46:59,632
不只是我，孩子们也是。
For boys, too.

1013
01:47:00,008 --> 01:47:03,091
但我也想申明一点，
But I want to make something perfectly clearly.

1014
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:06,132
从一开始，
Since the beginning, against all odds

1015
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:09,300
我们就胸怀同样的梦想——一个富强民主文明的新缅甸，
we have always shared the same dream
for Burma.

1016
01:47:09,468 --> 01:47:11,967
我认为这并不是什么障碍，
I consider him, not as an obstacle,

1017
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,175
反而是我们之间最坚实的纽带。
but as the bond that unites us.

1018
01:47:23,426 --> 01:47:27,800
有夫如此，夫复何求。
You must be the husband
the most indulgent of all history.

1019
01:48:09,177 --> 01:48:12,009
1998年11月
November 1998

1020
01:48:12,177 --> 01:48:14,009
那是我最后一次见她。
That's the last time I saw her.

1021
01:48:15,219 --> 01:48:18,176
从那以后，就只能靠不断摩挲这张照片，
来寄托我无尽的思念。
Since that day,been wiped
refued one after another

1022
01:48:18,594 --> 01:48:21,759
赶快填好这些表格，我就能休息了。
I could fill out their forms
eyes closed.

1023
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:26,594
- Thank you.   -谢谢。
- Nothing.     -客气了。

1024
01:48:31,678 --> 01:48:33,302
她知道了吗？
Suu know?

1025
01:48:34,761 --> 01:48:35,677
不管怎么说，
Finally,

1026
01:48:35,845 --> 01:48:37,427
你还是得告诉她。
you will have to tell her.

1027
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:41,552
再等等吧。
All in good time, Anthony.

1028
01:48:42,595 --> 01:48:45,219
你到底准备怎么给她说？
How will you tell her?

1029
01:48:50,803 --> 01:48:52,427
英国来信！
A letter from England!

1030
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,429
哦，是你啊，太好了。
How wonderful!

1031
01:50:13,597 --> 01:50:16,721
到最后，还能听到你的声音。
It does me good to hear your voice.

1032
01:50:17,181 --> 01:50:18,763
亲爱的，你现在怎么样？
How are you, darling?

1033
01:50:19,098 --> 01:50:20,680
你看过信了?
Did you get my letter.

1034
01:50:23,139 --> 01:50:24,763
我还是不敢相信。
I'm still trying to take it in.

1035
01:50:25,014 --> 01:50:26,722
天意如此。
Yes, of course.

1036
01:50:26,973 --> 01:50:28,722
不过，好消息是
The good news

1037
01:50:28,973 --> 01:50:32,180
为了我们的梦想，我一直战斗到了最后一刻。
is that I fully intended to fight all the way.

1038
01:50:32,889 --> 01:50:35,805
我最后只想再见你一面，
And nothing will stimulate me more than
coming see you.

1039
01:50:36,348 --> 01:50:38,680
如果签证顺利，
If all goes well for my visa...

1040
01:50:39,514 --> 01:50:41,180
而且
And I believe

1041
01:50:41,848 --> 01:50:45,222
上苍保佑我的身体条件允许，
that my condition would make them indulgent

1042
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:47,930
我们可以，最后一次地，
once and for all...

1043
01:50:48,264 --> 01:50:52,430
一起为我过个生日。
We have a good chance to see us
for my birthday.

1044
01:50:53,807 --> 01:50:55,514
我们可得好好庆祝下，好吗？
We could celebrate together.

1045
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:56,639
一定。
Right.

1046
01:50:57,182 --> 01:50:57,848
一定。
Yes.

1047
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:59,514
老婆，高兴点。
Courage, Suu.

1048
01:51:00,182 --> 01:51:02,556
为了我高兴点好吗？
Courage. High hearts!

1049
01:51:05,015 --> 01:51:06,681
还在听吗？
Hello? Are you still there?

1050
01:51:06,849 --> 01:51:08,598
我在这呢。
Yes, I'm here.

1051
01:51:09,224 --> 01:51:10,306
好。
Good.

1052
01:51:10,599 --> 01:51:12,389
我以前的一个学生，
A former student of mine,

1053
01:51:13,307 --> 01:51:14,306
曾经做过和尚的
a former monk

1054
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:16,181
Karma，
named Karma,

1055
01:51:16,557 --> 01:51:17,473
经常来照顾我。
is great to comfort me.

1056
01:51:17,724 --> 01:51:18,639
不错。
Good.

1057
01:51:19,224 --> 01:51:19,973
是啊。
Yes.

1058
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:23,889
照顾好自己。
Take care of yourself.

1059
01:51:24,224 --> 01:51:27,014
马上就能再见面了。
See you soon. It will not be long.

1060
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:29,098
娃他娘？
Suu?

1061
01:52:14,142 --> 01:52:15,516
Gordon先生，
Gordon, we...

1062
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:34,058
Gordon先生，
Gordon,

1063
01:52:34,226 --> 01:52:38,016
我们必须向当局施压，
we must
try to pressure the authorities.

1064
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:41,850
Anthony说，我们已经采取一系列行动。
According to Anthony
steps have already been undertaken.

1065
01:52:42,017 --> 01:52:45,850
他已经联系过Desmond Tutu（1984年诺贝尔和平奖得主）
和白宫方面，
He spoke to Desmond Tutu and the White House.

1066
01:52:46,102 --> 01:52:50,142
在Michael拿到签证以前，
Rest assured that none of us will sit

1067
01:52:50,393 --> 01:52:52,267
我们不会放弃哪怕一丝努力。
before Michael had his visa.

1068
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:55,351
谢谢你们。
Thank you.

1069
01:53:21,268 --> 01:53:24,226
你怎么这么不爱惜身体。
You are your worst enemy.

1070
01:53:24,978 --> 01:53:28,352
我求你了，Michael，上床休息好吗？
I beg you, Michael.
Back to bed.

1071
01:53:29,311 --> 01:53:31,685
- It's almost midnight.   -都半夜了。
- I know.                 -我知道。

1072
01:53:32,061 --> 01:53:34,435
就10分钟，再给我10分钟好吗?
10 minutes, Karma.
Give me another 10 minutes.

1073
01:53:34,811 --> 01:53:37,060
我还得应付成堆
I have a mountain of alien's corresponse

1074
01:53:37,228 --> 01:53:38,393
的回信。
to treat.

1075
01:53:39,728 --> 01:53:41,560
时间不等人。
It can not wait.

1076
01:53:42,228 --> 01:53:44,560
我走了，学生们怎么办？
Who will care for my students?

1077
01:53:45,228 --> 01:53:47,352
他们都还指望着我呢。
There are people who count on me.

1078
01:53:47,519 --> 01:53:50,643
我不能躺在床上虚度生命。
I can not spend my time hanging out in bed.

1079
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:52,643
求你了……
Please...

1080
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:56,768
再忙上10分钟我一定睡觉。
I'll go to bed in 10 minutes.

1081
01:53:57,603 --> 01:53:58,477
你保证？
Promised?

1082
01:53:58,936 --> 01:53:59,893
我保证。
I promise.

1083
01:54:00,436 --> 01:54:01,685
明天见。
Tomorrow.

1084
01:54:01,895 --> 01:54:02,853
晚安。
Good night.

1085
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:35,394
你那一切都好吗？
How are you?

1086
01:54:35,812 --> 01:54:37,686
你听说什么了吗？
Have you heard of anything yet?

1087
01:54:38,354 --> 01:54:39,894
尽量快点，他们一会又要切断电话了。
Quickly, before they cut the line.

1088
01:54:41,105 --> 01:54:42,812
我只想知道
I need to know.

1089
01:54:43,105 --> 01:54:45,437
大夫允许你长途奔波吗？
Do they
suggested that you could come?

1090
01:54:47,521 --> 01:54:48,937
当然了，随便哪一天都行。
Any day now.

1091
01:54:50,396 --> 01:54:51,062
我向你保证，
I promise you.

1092
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:53,979
不会太久。
It will not be very long.

1093
01:54:55,771 --> 01:54:57,479
我想……
I thought...

1094
01:54:57,938 --> 01:54:58,979
什么？
What?

1095
01:54:59,896 --> 01:55:01,229
我……
Should I...

1096
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,770
你觉得我该不该过来找你？
do you think I should come to see you?

1097
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:11,104
千万别这样，想也别想。
You must not think about it for a moment.

1098
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:16,229
现在是最紧要的关头，
It was not all that to collapse so close.

1099
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:22,563
绝大多数人都支持我们，
The highest level support us.

1100
01:55:25,356 --> 01:55:27,355
这一切都……
Everything suggests that...

1101
01:55:29,986 --> 01:55:32,555
什么？
What?

1102
01:55:51,981 --> 01:55:52,688
爹。
Hi.

1103
01:55:55,356 --> 01:55:56,063
是你娘。
It was your mother.

1104
01:55:59,357 --> 01:56:00,981
她让我带问你好。
She kisses you.

1105
01:56:25,398 --> 01:56:27,481
虽然有点晚，
It took longer than expected.

1106
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:30,356
但我早就知道
But I knew

1107
01:56:30,982 --> 01:56:33,772
即使是昂山将军的女儿，
someday
even the daughter of General Aung San

1108
01:56:33,941 --> 01:56:36,607
最终也不得不放弃。
eventually give up.

1109
01:56:43,066 --> 01:56:44,107
夫人。
Madam.

1110
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:47,482
将军仔细考虑了您的请求，
General
has read your letter carefully.

1111
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:50,523
他让我来通知您，
He asked me to inform you

1112
01:56:51,066 --> 01:56:53,857
很不幸，当局没有可以在途中
that the authorities simply do not have the resource

1113
01:56:54,024 --> 01:56:56,065
照顾您先生的相关设备。
to deal with your husband's medical needs.

1114
01:56:56,233 --> 01:56:58,190
你们的好意我领了，但这不用你们担心。
It's not what you are asked.

1115
01:56:58,733 --> 01:57:02,607
挪威政府借给我们一架备有医疗器械的直升机，
The Norwegian government
lends us an air ambulance.

1116
01:57:03,608 --> 01:57:07,565
敏感词派他的医生在一路上照顾Michael。
The Dalai Lama sends us
one of his doctors to follow Michael.

1117
01:57:07,858 --> 01:57:11,107
当然，出于人道主义考虑，
You want to be with your husband
in such a time.

1118
01:57:11,734 --> 01:57:14,399
我可以为您安排下一航班，
I offer you a place
on the next flight.

1119
01:57:15,067 --> 01:57:18,066
这样，你们明天就能团聚了。
You might be at his bedside
tomorrow.

1120
01:57:18,275 --> 01:57:20,858
你们这是想赶我走。
You would not let me go back.

1121
01:57:24,942 --> 01:57:27,191
您可以自由选择，
You are free to choose,

1122
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:30,316
是您的家人
between your husband and your children
