为什么这突如其来的变化，大卫？

如果我们去那里的时间提前，

他从来没有采取任何决定，没有跟我讨论。

你将如何找到一个买家？

535
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,417
我们已经采取了正确的决定。
We've taken the right decision now.

536
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,709
我们已经为他做了这么多钱。
We've made so much money for him.

537
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:28,626
还等什么？ 他在这个行业多年。
So what? He's in this business for years.

538
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,959
他让你成长？
Would he let you grow?

539
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,376
他不会。 - 然后呢？
He will not. - Then?

540
01:15:36,959 --> 01:15:38,584
我们还必须让他去做。
We must also not let him do it.

541
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:47,959
好吧，你的计划是什么？
Okay, what's your plan?

542
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:54,542
我们在嘉年华当天密封俄罗斯交易。
We're sealing the Russian deal on carnival day.

543
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:48,209
你想要去加拿大，这是它。

544
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,417
这是为了接受做我的工作。

545
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,876
接受和完成。
For accepting and accomplishing it.

546
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:16,709
什么是保证你会不会背叛我，像你这样的与大卫？
What's the guaranty that you'll not betray me like you did with David?

547
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:49,709
我告诉你之前，
I told you before,

548
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:52,376
有风险工作生活之间的差异，
there's difference between one who risks life to work,

549
01:20:52,626 --> 01:20:55,834
和谁坐在舒适的家中工作。
and one who sits in the comforts of home to work.

550
01:20:56,959 --> 01:21:00,751
为什么你误判大卫・比拉？
Why did you misjudge David Billa?

551
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:10,292
我应该已经采取了你个人，这是我的错误，信任他人。
I should've taken you personally, it's my mistake to trust others.

552
01:21:11,959 --> 01:21:14,959
我不会请求你的宽恕，杀了我吧！
I'll not ask your forgiveness, kill me!

553
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:18,542
杀了我！
Kill me!

554
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:28,417
大卫，他威胁要杀死我，这就是为什么...
David, he threatened to kill me, that's why...

555
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:31,376
人们可以杀死成千上万的敌人，赢得
One can kill thousands of enemies to win,

556
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:32,584
这是没有错的，
it's not wrong,

557
01:21:33,251 --> 01:21:36,959
但它是一个严重的错误，甚至腾出一个背叛者！
but it's a grave mistake to spare even one betrayer!

558
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:00,209

试图休息...

563
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:21,376
它会吃掉你，并在你的手...

565
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:33,792
球会不会提高，除非你踢它......

566
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:36,917
适者生存...
The fittest will survive...

567
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:41,209
这是法治的性质...
That's the rule of the nature...

568
01:23:07,626 --> 01:23:13,792
如果你生活在地狱里，你必须成为一个野兽......
If you live in hell, you must become a beast...

569
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:20,251
牺牲和吓唬人... 提高一次又一次的黑客...
Sacrifice and scare people... raise again and again on hacking...

570
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:23,417
世界是不是圆的......

571
01:23:23,584 --> 01:23:26,626
在这个世界上没有表单影子...
There's no form to shadow in this world...

572
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:32,251
打破规则，使自己的规则...
Break the rules and make your own rules...

573
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:38,459
有没有朋友在这里，这里没有敌人...
There's no friend here and no enemy here...

574
01:23:38,626 --> 01:23:45,459
你是你唯一的朋友和你的敌人......
You're your only friend and your enemy too...

575
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,792
第一拳必须使敌人哆嗦，...
First punch must make enemy shiver...

576
01:24:25,959 --> 01:24:28,792
下一页冲必须奴役他......
Next punch must enslave him...

577
01:24:29,292 --> 01:24:35,376
如果他再次起身再次击中了他，这个时候敲他的生活......
If he gets up again hit him again, this time knock-out his life...

578
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:41,792
你死了，每天和每天重生...
You die every day and be born again every day...

579
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:47,667
警惕甚至睡觉时睁大眼睛......
Be alert even while asleep with eyes wide open...

580
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:53,626
你是你的问题，你是你的边界......
You're your problem and you're your boundary...

581
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:56,626
你的触摸撕刺，...
Your touch will tear the thorn...

582
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,584
虽然这是痛苦的，没有痛苦......
Though it's painful, there's no pain...

583
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:04,001
适者生存...
The fittest will survive...

584
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:07,709
这是法治的性质...
That's the rule of the nature...

585
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:11,959
不要杀我先生。

586
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:08,417
托运不会没有我寸步难行。

587
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:09,917
主席先生！
Sir!

588
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:54,959
主席先生，你的支票！
Sir, your cheque!

589
01:27:18,626 --> 01:27:25,459
官立。 不只是不足以消除贫困计划和金钱。
Govt. plans and money aren't just enough to eradicate poverty.

590
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:33,376
大卫・比拉国家福利基金，捐赠卢比亿卢比
David Billa has donated Rs.1 crore to state welfare fund,

591
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:42,292
我们会花这个钱的人唯一的福利。
we'll spend the money for the welfare of people only.

592
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:48,876

这是公众。

596
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:10,959
但是因为有了你什么都想要多少都想要。

597
01:28:11,376 --> 01:28:12,417
任何时间！

598
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,292
我准备放弃。
I'm ready to give.

599
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,292
如果你靠勤奋，成长到这个位置
Had you grown to this position by hard work,

600
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,751
你就不会这样说话，
you wouldn't speak like this,

601
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:30,292
你是一个强盗，并上升到这个位置的捷径。
you were a gangster and rose to this position in short cut.

602
01:28:32,334 --> 01:28:36,584
无论你是商人或苦力还是乞丐，
Whether one is business man or a coolie or a beggar,

603
01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:37,834
每个人都有辛劳，
everyone has to toil,

604
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:42,959
你是首席部长，
you're a Chief Minister,

605
01:28:43,709 --> 01:28:46,959
你劳碌得来的国家和人民的福利，
you toil for the welfare of the state and its people,

606
01:28:57,709 --> 01:29:03,542
你需要帮助的歹徒像我这样拿上你的敌人。
you need help of gangsters like me to take on your enemies.

607
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,459
你误会了我。
You've mistaken me.

608
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:13,959
此CM是不卖！
This CM is not for sale!

609
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:20,709
智能翼给您的完整信息。

610
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:51,751
来吧，让我们下去。

611
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:55,292
你走了，我会一直追随。
You go, I'll follow.

612
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,751
请留下我一个人。
Please leave me alone.

613
01:30:02,376 --> 01:30:05,542
为什么呢？ CM说什么？
Why? What did the CM say?

614
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:33,209
我向你保证，这种情况下，我们会彻底调查，
I assure you this case will be thoroughly investigated,

615
01:32:33,376 --> 01:32:34,959
犯罪分子将得到惩罚。
and the criminals will get punished.

616
01:32:35,292 --> 01:32:39,542
在党的机构会议将选举产生新的CM。
New CM will be elected in the party's general body meeting.

617
01:32:40,459 --> 01:32:46,376
我希望人们不要让情绪激动，在这些测试时间维持和平。
I want people not to get agitated and maintain peace in these testing times.

618
01:32:50,209 --> 01:32:53,584
部长，没有人能配合你的动作。
Minister, nobody can match your moves.

619
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:55,709
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

620
01:32:56,251 --> 01:32:57,959
迪米特里想比拉死。
Dimitri wants Billa dead.

621
01:32:58,334 --> 01:33:01,292
你想成为CM和目前CM必须死定了。
You want to become CM and present CM must be dead.

622
01:33:01,459 --> 01:33:03,459
你已经完成了所有三个。
You've accomplished all three.

623
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:08,709
此后，我们迪米特里在印度的贸易伙伴。
Hereafter we're Dimitri's business partners in India.

624
01:33:08,959 --> 01:33:12,709
不庆祝，比拉是还没有死。
Don't celebrate, Billa is not yet dead.

625
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:14,292
他在监狱里。
He's in jail.

626
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:16,376
他不能出来。
He can't come out.

627
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:18,209
他寻求保释。
He has sought bail.

628
01:33:18,376 --> 01:33:21,751
还等什么？ 我见过他威胁CM。
So what? I've seen him threatening CM.

629
01:33:21,959 --> 01:33:23,792
有很多目击证人。
There are many eye witnesses.

630
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:27,792
此外，我们所生产的证据是很强的。
Moreover evidence produced by us is very strong.

631
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:29,542
他怎么来了？
How can he come out?

632
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:31,542
如果他仍然设法保释出来，
If he still manages to come out on bail,

633
01:33:31,709 --> 01:33:35,584
有没有采取货币形式意义。
there's no meaning for taking money form you.

634
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:58,667
大卫・比拉是谁站在这里，作为被告，
David Billa who is standing here as the accused,

635
01:33:58,834 --> 01:34:01,334
事发当天，他喝醉了酒，
on the day of the incident, he was drunk,

636
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:04,959
威胁CM，以帮助他在他的生意。
and was threatening CM to help him in his business.

637
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:08,626
有许多在场的人亲眼目睹了这
Many people present there witnessed this,

638
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:14,209
事实上，有媒体渠道，它与视频片段。
in fact there's video footage of it with media channels.

639
01:34:14,376 --> 01:34:17,542
如果你让他保释出来，
If you let him out on bail,

640
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:22,792
他可以消灭我们的证据，并威胁证人。
he can wipe our evidence and threaten witnesses.

641
01:34:22,959 --> 01:34:25,626
他理应受到严厉惩罚，你的荣誉。
He deserves to be punished severely, your honour.

642
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:30,584
因此，我要求法院不给予保释比拉。
So I request this court not to grant bail to Billa.

643
01:35:06,959 --> 01:35:09,876
眼看你的情感倾诉与CM在功能，
Seeing your emotional talk with the CM in the function,

644
01:35:10,209 --> 01:35:11,876
Praveen库马尔起到了肮脏的游戏。
Praveen Kumar played a dirty game.

645
01:35:12,209 --> 01:35:15,417
我想我也不会获得保释，你是怎么管理的？
I thought I wouldn't get bail, how did you manage it?

646
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:19,626
你告诉我，别人的恐惧是我们的强项。
You told me that others' fear is our strength.

647
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:20,876
我把它应用。
I applied it.

648
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:56,542
你知道，我已经很长一段时间以来的第三部份，
You know I've a third majority since long time,

649
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:59,376
我不能让大家部长，对不对？
I can't make everyone a Minister, right?

650
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:01,876
让我先成为CM！
Let me become CM first!

651
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:04,834
之后我会受到质疑！
After there I'll be unchallenged!

652
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:07,501
难道你不相信我吗？
Don't you trust me?

653
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:10,709
我为这一天等待多年。
I was waiting years for this day.

654
01:36:10,876 --> 01:36:11,751
我有...
I have...

655
01:36:20,501 --> 01:36:24,292
希望成为CM和孵化的计划，
Desiring to become CM and hatching a plan for it,

656
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,417
它的所有政治，
it's all politics,

657
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:32,209
但它送我去监狱是愚昧。
but sending me to jail for it is foolishness.

658
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:33,751
你会杀了我吗？
Will you kill me now?

659
01:36:36,209 --> 01:36:39,751
有没有资格成为我的朋友。
There's no qualification to become my friend.

660
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:44,542
但需要资格成为我的敌人。
But one needs qualification to become my enemy.

661
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,792
你没有任何。
You don't have any.

662
01:36:51,376 --> 01:36:55,417
我决定，我会杀了你从监狱...
Had I decided I would've killed you from jail...

663
01:36:57,792 --> 01:37:01,501
不要说像一个傻瓜，如果有什么发生在我身上，
Don't talk like a fool, if anything happens to me,

664
01:37:01,667 --> 01:37:05,417
有万卢比的人，我给他们的生活。
there are lakhs of people to give their lives for me.

665
01:37:06,376 --> 01:37:11,417
人们可能会为你投票，但不会放弃对你的生活。
People may vote for you but won't give life for you.

666
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:22,542
我就不班门弄斧到您的区域，
I'll not trespass into your area,

667
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:27,542
就不班门弄斧了我区！
don't trespass into my area!

668
