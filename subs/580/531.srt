00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. The entire lab, just...

111
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gone. Where did it go?

112
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care.

113
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41.

114
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A transmutation serum.

115
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is PX-41, you ask?

116
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty bad.

117
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look.

118
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You usually don't see that in bunnies.

119
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you could see,

120
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the wrong hands,

121
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the PX-41 serum,

122
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.

123
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fortunately,

124
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it has a very distinct chemical footprint.

125
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, using the latest chem tracking technology,

126
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.

127
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Mall.

128
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precisely.

129
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we believe that

130
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of these shop owners is a master criminal.

131
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain,

132
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know how a villain thinks, and acts.

133
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plan is, to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall,

134
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where hopefully, you'll be able to...

135
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay! I see where this is going

136
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with all the "Mission: Impossible" stuff.

137
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no, no.

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a father now. And, a legitimate businessman.

139
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.

140
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Jams and jellies".

141
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, attitude!

142
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right!

143
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So thanks, but no thanks.

144
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And here's a tip: instead of teasing people, and kidnapping them,

145
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe you should just give them a call!

146
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good day, Mr. Sheepbutt!

147
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ramsbottom.

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, like I said it better!

149
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but...

150
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your work as a villain, was kind of, amazing.

151
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome.

152
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us a call.

153
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I told you guys to get to bed!

154
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sorry.

155
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, when are you going on your date?

156
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

157
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember? Ms. Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.

158
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, she is a nutjob and I'm not going on any date.

159
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

160
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you scared?

161
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV?

162
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe it? It's so cool!

163
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know what? - Excuse me, Lisa?

164
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I talked to alien the other day. - no way.

165

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's so cute.

166
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Lisa, I was wondering...

167
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru touched Lisa!

168
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa's got Gruties!

169
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scared? Of what?

170
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Women? No!

171
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's bonkers!

172
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just, I've no interest in going on a date, that's all!

173
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Case closed!

174
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not scared!

175
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of women.

176
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or dates.

177
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go to bed.

178
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodnight, Edith.

181
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who are you texting?

182
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one! Just my friend Avery.

183
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avery. Eh? Avery?

184
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?

185
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it matter?

186
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No, it doesn't matter,

187
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unless it's a boy!

188
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what makes you a boy.

189
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uhh, you do?

190
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your bald head.

191
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Yes.

192
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really smooth.

193
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes I stare at it,

194
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and imagine a little chick popping out.

195
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodnight, Agnes.

196
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never get older.

197
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

198
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tommy, hang in there, baby!

199
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's almost Friday!

200
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?

201
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I developed a new formula which allowed me

202
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get every known kind of berry in a one flavor of jelly.

203
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is good!

204
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love the flavor of...

205
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's horrible, isn't it?

206
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no!

207
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, we're making great progress!

208
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, try some.

209
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because everybody hates it,

210
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean it's not good!

211
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Gru. There's something

212
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.

213
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, what's wrong?

214
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss being evil.

215
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sinister plots, large-scale crimes,

216
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what I live for!

567
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged,

568
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I make it my business to know all about them.

569
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're bald. And that is bad.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take it you're an art lover?

576
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No serum.

577
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, not so much.

578
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, how about this impressive trinket?

579
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hardly call it trinket,

580

586
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should take one.

587
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks.

588
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what's on the other side of the wall?

589

00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,030

596
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she goes!

597

610
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

611

616
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Si! Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?

617
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, sit! Let me get you something.

618

620
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh... I'm sorry. Paulito is usually,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}very friendly.

622
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a rough night.

623
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we really should be going.

624
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Girls, come on.

625
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,880

628
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are not in love. They hardly know each other.

629
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are right, cabeza del nuevo.

630
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must get to know each other better.

631
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Antonio,

632
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you invite your girlfriend? And her family.

633
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To our Cinco De Mayo party.

634
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no...

635
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sì!

636
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, El Macho?

637
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't we eliminated him as a suspect after the whole "Salsa" Incident?

638
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but there has been a new development,

639
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm telling you, this is the guy.

640
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to arrest him immediately.

641
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And!

642
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His deviously charming son.

643
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure that the son is involved too.

644
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The son, also!

645
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to get the son!

646
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that the son is the mastermind.

647
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a look,

648
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it!

649
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but I don't believe seeing any evidence...

650
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evidence, schmevidence, I go with my gut, and my gut tells me,

651
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this guy is El Macho.

652
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lock him up,

653

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't forget about the son!

655
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid, gives me the creeps!

656
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear...

657
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, on the less crazy side of things,

658
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!

659
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm. Interesting.

660

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! And you know who made that happen?

661
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy. Nailed it.

662
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing, right?

663

664
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, but it's not him!

665
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is El Macho...

666
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Gru,

668
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it is him and I will prove it.

669
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru, come on.

670
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He really thinks it's El Macho.

671
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you tell him?

672
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,650

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can stretch right up and touch the sky

674
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the weather's fine,

675
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We go fishin' or go swimmin' in the sea

676

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're always happy

677
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,960

684
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Lex,

685
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,350

686
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, we need to revisit

687

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the number of vacation days you guys get.

688
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't find anybody anymore!

689
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru, it's Jillian!

690
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got good news!

691
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have my friend Shannon here with me.

692
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking you two could get some grub.

693
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, tear it up,

694

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}see what happens.

695

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open up!

696
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agnes! Agnes,

697

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tell Jillian, I'm not here.

698
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru's not here!

699
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

700
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, he just told me!

701
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean no, he didn't just tell me.

702
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agnes, where is Gru?

703
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's, putting on lipstick.

704
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's, swatting a fly.

705
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's, chopping a head off!

706
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's... pooping?

707
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're in there, Gru.

708
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no way you're getting out of this.

709
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to tell you I was so nervous about tonight.

710
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean there's just so many phonies out there.

711
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I hear you.

712
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, do you work out?

713
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

714
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, obviously you don't.

715
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But would you consider it?

716
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.

717
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can tell, right?

718
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, I can tell.

719

720
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are in a restaurant,

721
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know?

722
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, take out for Lucy.

723
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,280

724
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your accent is so exotic.

725
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah..Well, thank you very much.

726
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I was...- I know someone who can fix that for you.

727
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you'll be talking normal in no time!

728
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whew... Is it hot in here?

729
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the food?

730
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute, wait a minute...

731
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you wearing a wig?

732
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

733
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, I don't think so.

734
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it.

735
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a phony.

736
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate phonies.

737
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh... what? No, these locks are all mine!

738
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they're not!

739
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I'm gonna do?

740
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna rip that thing off your head

741
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and show everyone

742
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what a bald-headed phony you are.

743
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so, Miss Lady.

744
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

745

749
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you doing?

750
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.

751
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like she's been shot with a mild tranquilizer.

752
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Noooo...

753
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm winking 'cause that's what actually happened.

754
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excusi, what's happening here?

755
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She no like?

756
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, she's just, uhh...

757
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.. Oh-ho-ho.. Sì! Sì.

758
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shall we take her home?

759
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think you did it.

760
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just officially had the worst date ever.

761
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ohh. Tell me about it.

762
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:49,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

763
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can only get better from here, right?

764
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.

765
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do use it on, one or two dates myself.

766
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you know as far as dates go,

767
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm good with just, the one.

768
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, partner.

769
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was fun.

770
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, surprisingly, it was.

771
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and just between you and me,

772
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look much better bald.

773
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you tomorrow!

774
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might seem crazy what I'm about to say

775
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sunshine she's here, you can take a break

776
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space

777
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I take it the date went well?

778
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it was horrible.

779
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I don't care baby by the way

780
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

781
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

782
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

783
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth

784
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

785
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you know what happiness is to you

786
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

787
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

788
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring me down, can't nothing

789
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring me Down, my level is too high

790
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring me down, can't nothing

791
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring me down, I said

792
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

793
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

794
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm happy

795
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap along if you know what's best what you wanna do

796
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Ramsbottom?

797
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hello.

798
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

799
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got him.

800
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:49,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got who?

801
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Floyd Eagle-san.

802
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night,

803
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, uh,

804
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}discovered this.

805
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's empty but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.

806
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:01,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is our man.

807
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.

808
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was framed!

809
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't get away with this!

810
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your mitts off of me!

811
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, so...

812
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What now?

813
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now, you're free to go back to your business.

814
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmmm! Jams and jellies.

815
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it looks like Agent Wilde

816
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be transferring to our Australian branch.

817
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Australia?

818
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

819
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But thank you, for everything.

820
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by everything, of course I mean, nothing.

821
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toodles and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

822
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey there.

823
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

824
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we got him.

825
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yay!

826
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great.

827
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now you're going to Australia?

828
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not definite yet.

829
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still figuring it out.

830
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Already been working on my accent.

831
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hugh Jackman

832
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,460

833
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

834
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good luck.

835
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

836
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, too.

837
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, here. I wanted to give you this.

838
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your lipstick taser?

839
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's just a memento.

840
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... you know.

841
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From, the first time we met.

842
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

843
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Wilde?

844
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it looks like they need you.

845
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

846
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah...

847
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I better go.

848
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Gru.

849
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought you an umbrella.

850
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, thank you.

851
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing out here?

852
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?

853
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it turns out...

854
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are right.

855
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

856
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but...

857
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she's moving away.

858
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm never going to see her again.

859
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anything I can do to help?

860
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't...

861
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so, sweetheart.

862
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well is there anything you could do?

863
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

865
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up to this point,

866
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our relationship has been strictly professional.

867
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're leaving for Australia and all...

904
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the look of a broken heart.

905
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know?

918
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?

919
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good joke.

920
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just did a boom-boom.

932
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

933
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I merely faked my death.

978
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need to get some things off my plate,

979
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before we start taking over the world, that's all.

980
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

981
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, forget it. 100%, I am in.

982
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, what is that? Do you hear that?

983
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do. That's Agnes calling me, from undis...

984
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Totally in!

985
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I am not so convinced that he is in.

986
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Edith, Agnes, come on!

987
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oops, sorry!

988
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to go home now!

989
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is Margo?

990
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Margo!

991
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! We're...

992
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:27,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's wrong?

993
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate boys.

994
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, they stink.

995
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:37,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, sorry, honey, we got to go.

996
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

997
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Paulito.

998
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter?

999
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, Eduardo.

1000
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucia.

1001
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I apologize. Paulito, is usually not like this.

1002
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same thing happened the other day with...

1003
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With Gru...

1004
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speaking of Gru,

1005
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have you seen him?

1006
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really need to talk to him.

1007
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I think he's somewhere around here.

1008
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two are close, no?

1009
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh... I don't know.

1010
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, close, I wouldn't say we're, "Close".

1011
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, did he say we're close?

1012
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he say that?

1013
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not what he did say.

1014
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For instance,

1015
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he never mentioned...

1016
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!

1017
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're coming with me.

1018
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funky.

1019
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Eduardo's actually El Macho?

1020
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool!

1021
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it is not cool!

1022
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once I pretty much knew it was him all along,

1023
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so if anyone's cool, it's me.

1024
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru!

1025
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Dr. Nefario.

1026
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}El Macho's onto you.

1027
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows you're working for the AVL.

1028
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, he's got your partner.

1029
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucy?

1030
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's, impossible.

1031
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's on her way to Australia.

1032
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nefario!

1033
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, got to go.

1034
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got Lucy?

1035
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for long.

1036
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1037
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting her out of there.

1038
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1039
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see anything.

1040
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My unicorn!

1041
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:44,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agnes, run!

1042
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Hurry!

1043
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move!

1044
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter?

1045
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kevin!

1046
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Nefario! You're back!

1047
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the flesh!

1048
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behold...

1049
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Antidote.

1050
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1051
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time we put this horrible jelly to some good use.

1052
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Guys! Come on! Stay focus here!

1053
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Curses!

1054
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foiled again!

1055
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These guys captured me!

1056
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up that tree.

1057
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry! Hurry!

1058
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Gru!

1059
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

1060
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I put all antidote in the jelly.

1061
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world...

1062
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody messes with my family.

1063
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Doctor.

1064
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's go get the...

1065
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:24,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi!

1066
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You brought the girls?

1067
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1068
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Is that wrong?

1069
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening... to my minions?

1070
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gru?

1071
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.

1072
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to find Lucy.

1073
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat jelly, you furry freaks!

1074
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's over, El Macho.

1075
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now where is Lucy?

1076
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you.

1077
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Hey, Gru!

1078
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turns out you were right about the Polo Macho thing, huh?

1079
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One push of this button,

1080
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I send that rocket,

1081
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.

1082
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only this time...

1083
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for real.

1084
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1085
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could have ruled the world together, Gru.

1086
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now...

1091
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of your jelly guns.

1092
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, Sunshine.

1093
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine!

1094
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have survived lots worse than this.

1095
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, that's not entirely true.

1097
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. I will get you out of this.

1098
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really hate that chicken.

1099
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a red one? It's definitely the red one!

1100
