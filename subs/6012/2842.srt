5
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,295
你？又来了！出去！
You? You again! Get out!

6
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,669
按照我说的去做，出去！
Do what I told you. Get out!

7
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,382
继续！跑！我跟你说离我远点了
Go on! Run! I'll teach you to keep away from me!

8
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:58,818
跑！
Run!

9
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,660
爸爸！
Papa!

10
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,193
你这头蠢猪！
You filthy dog!

11
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,199
你会给我惹麻烦的
You'll settle with me!

12
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,421
我们走
Let's go.

13
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,302
欢迎你，陌生人
Welcome to you, stranger.

14
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:41,143
我叫胡安・迪欧斯，我是撞钟人
My name is Juan de Dios. I am the bell ringer.

15
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:43,843
你为什么来这里呢？ 想见洛乔斯？
Why are you here? To see the Rojos?

16
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:47,647
不，不是洛乔斯 或者可能是巴克斯特？
No, not the Rojos. Is it the Baxters maybe?

17
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,416
甚至也不是巴克斯特
Maybe not even the Baxters.

18
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,522
你想发财，是吗？
You want to get rich, eh?

19
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,515
如果那样想的话，你就来对了
Well, for that you have come to the right place...

20
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,526
如果你想想的话
If you use your head.

21
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:58,725
因为这里的每个人都很富裕
That's because everybody here has become very rich...

22
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,734
否则就死
or else they are dead.

23
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:04,396
你想买什么呢？ 枪？酒？
What do you want to buy? Some guns? Liquor?

24
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,531
你不买，你是卖 你卖铅来换黄金
You don't buy. You sell. You sell lead in exchange for gold.

25
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:11,008
在这你会发财的，要么就是死
You will get rich here, or you'll be killed.

26
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,011
胡安・迪欧斯又撞钟了
Juan de Dios tolls the bell once again.

27
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,465
在离家这么远的地方闲逛不是很聪明的事情
It's not smart to go wandering so far from home.

28
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,762
我想他选错路了
I reckon he picked the wrong trail.

29
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,900
或者就是选错镇了
Or he could have picked the wrong town.

30
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,535
他最大的错，我想就是出生
His big mistake, I think, was getting born.

31
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,639
如果你想找事做，那样看的话…
If you want any work, lookin' like that...

32
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:50,650
你会死的很难看的
you could try bein' a scarecrow.

33
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:54,848
噢，不，或者乌鸦很容易就可以把他吓坏
Oh, no, the crows are liable to scare him maybe.

34
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,405
你好
Hello.

35
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:26,912
你那样是不能发财的
You can't get rich like that.

36
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:30,423
至少，你只会死的更快
At most, you will only succeed in being killed.

37
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:36,485
看看我们这里的问题，我们所需要的就是你
With all of the trouble we have, all we needed was you.

38
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,999
- 你在找什么呢？ - 食物和喝的东西
- What are you looking for? - Food and something to drink.

39
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,365
- 水在那里 - 不，不要水
- Water's over there. - No, no water.

40
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,404
吃，喝，然后杀戮
Eating and drinking and killing.

41
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:49,145
你所能做的就那些，像你们那些人一样
That's all you can do, just like the rest of your kind.

42
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:53,373
顺便说一下，你要记在账上
By the way, you'll have to mark this up.

43
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,648
我知道，你没有钱
I know. You have no money.

44
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:58,247
毕竟，你刚刚进这个镇里
After all, you just got into town.

45
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,548
但是如果你不怕杀人的话
But if you don't mind doing a little killing...

46
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:04,522
找到帮你付钱的人不是很难
You will have no trouble finding someone eager to pay you.

47
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:14,628
我的轮盘机在转着 那个也是杀人
My roulette wheel. That, too, was murdered.

48
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:17,067
没有人来这里是玩的
No one ever comes here to play.

49
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:20,665
我们这里只是葬礼和埋葬
We spend our time here between funerals and burials.

50
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:23,208
从没有看过这么死寂的镇
Never saw a town as dead as this one.

51
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,407
你不会看到另外一个的
You will never see another like it.

52
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:33,043
- 这到底怎么了？ - 杀人的事情太多了
- What's wrong with the place? - We've had too many killings.

53
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,053
你看到那些女人了吗？
You have seen the women?

54
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,146
她们都不是女人，她们是寡妇
None of them are women. They're widows.

55
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,214
这个地方都是寡妇
The place is only widows.

56
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,761
在这里，只有杀人才能获得别人的尊敬
Here you can only gain respect by killing other men.

57
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,763
所以再也没有人工作了
So nobody works anymore.

58
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,925
看来有人不同意你的观点
Seems somebody doesn't share your opinion.

59
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,435
是的
Yes.

60
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,304
知道为什么配里皮洛看你吗？
Know why Piripero looked you over?

61
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,350
猜测你
To take your measurements.

62
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,750
他阅历丰富，一眼就可以看出来
He is so experienced. he can do it with a glance.

63
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,755
你会是个顾客
You will be a customer.

64
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,758
不要笑，我不是说笑
Don't laugh. I'm not joking.

65
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:15,556
我警告你，那些歹徒有天会杀了你的
I want to warn you that those murderers will make a corpse out of you one day.

66
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,223
所以我想让你离开这里
That's why I want you to get out of here.

67
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:21,324
你不想呆在墓地里吧
You don't want to stay in this cemetery.

68
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,494
快吃完，离开这里
Finish up and get out.

69
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,197
我跟你说过我没钱
I told ya I can't pay ya.

70
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,538
做我的客人…
Be my guest...

71
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:33,443
离开桑・米吉尔，好吗？
but get out of San Miguel, will you?

72
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,884
这是往哪里的呢？
Where does that lead?

73
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:40,648
阳台
The balcony.

74
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:44,657
你为什么上去呢？喂
Why are you going there? Hey!

75
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,022
看看
To have a look.

76
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,084
从高处看的话，总是会发现一些新东西
Things always look different from higher up.

77
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,114
但是上面什么都没有
But nothing's up there.

78
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,029
快点离开这里
Go ahead and get out!

79
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,835
他们是谁呢？
Who are they?

80
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:07,311
强盗，强盗和走私犯
Bandits. Bandits and smugglers.

81
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,439
他们从德克萨斯来的
They come down from Texas.

82
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,542
他们穿越边境来囤积枪和酒
They cross the frontier to stock up on guns and liquor.

83
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,553
这里的成本比较低
The cost is much less here.

84
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:17,488
然后他回去把枪和酒卖给印第安人
Then they go back and sell the guns and liquor to the Indians.

85
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,557
每个卖枪和酒的城镇都会是个富裕的城镇
Any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be a rich one.

86
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,724
不是镇里的人，只是那些卖的人
Not the town, only those who buy and sell...

87
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,529
还有那些头
and the bosses are the ones who clean up.

88
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:32,002
是吗？应该有人管理这个地方. 每个镇都有头的
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place. Every town has a boss.

89
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:34,597
那是的，但是如果有两个的话…
That's true, but when there are two around...

90
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:37,199
那么有一个就是多余的了
then I'd say that there is one too many.

91
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,541
两个头？
Two bosses?

92
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,546
真有趣
Very interesting.

93
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,981
有趣是对的
Interesting is right.

94
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,611
洛乔斯，卖酒的三兄弟
The Rojos boys, three brothers who sell liquor.

95
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:51,487
那边的是巴克斯特，大军火商
And then there's the Baxters, big gun merchants.

96
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:56,018
如果我没弄错的话，你已经见过巴克斯特的人了，不是吗？
If I'm not mistaken, you already met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

97
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,758
是的，见过了
Yeah, we met.

98
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:02,097
但是你很幸运 他们不是一直只对准骡的
But you're lucky. They don't usually limit their fire to the mule.

99
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:05,160
一个男人离开自己的地方，在这里四处张望
A man leaves his own land and looks around for any reason...

100
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:09,334
胡安・迪欧斯敲一下钟，然后配里皮洛卖另外一副棺材
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and Piripero sells another coffin.

101
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,843
两个头
Two bosses.

102
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,783
他们招募边境两边所有能战斗的人
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs around both sides of the frontier...

103
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,979
他们用美元付钱
and they pay in dollars.

104
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,487
巴克斯特在那里
The Baxters over there.

105
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,321
洛乔斯在那
The Rojos there.

106
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,885
我就在中间
Me right in the middle.

107
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,955
你想去哪里？
Where you do what?

108
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,594
撞钟人是对的
Crazy bell ringer was right.

109
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,193
在这样的地方可以发财
There's money to be made in a place like this.

110
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,732
如果你说那样想的话，跟你说，不要试
If you're thinking what I suspect, I tell you, don't try it.

111
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,301
他们两个谁比较厉害？
Which one of the two is the stronger?

112
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,371
他们两个谁比较厉害？
Which one of them is stronger?

113
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,851
洛乔斯，尤其是雷蒙
Well, the Rojos, especially Ramon.

114
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:07,929
米吉尔・罗吉先生，我想跟你说话
Don Miguel Rojo, I want to talk to you.

115
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:13,165
米吉尔先生，我听说你想要人
Don Miguel, I hear you're hiring on men.

116
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,970
我可能很适合
Well, I might just be available.

117
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,537
在你雇佣我之前，我想告诉你
I gotta tell you before you hire me...

118
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,280
我不是很便宜的
I don't work cheap.

119
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,668
准备三副棺材
Get three coffins ready.

120
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,526
再见，朋友
Adios, amigo.

121
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,997
听着，陌生人！你还没想好吗？
Listen, stranger! Didn't you get the idea?

122
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,466
我们不想在镇里看到像你那样的人
We don't like to see bad boys like you in town.

123
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,093
去找你的骡
Go get your mule.

124
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,607
你这样让它跑了吗？
You let him get away from you?

125
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:23,471
我正想跟你们说这事
That's what I want to talk to you about.

126
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,604
- 它的感受很不好 - 什么？
- He's feeling real bad. - Hmm?

127
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,408
我的骡
My mule.

128
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,815
你们朝它的脚开枪，把它激怒了
He got all riled up when you men fired those shots at his feet.

129
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:37,713
喂，你在说笑吗？
Hey, are you makin' some kind of joke?

130
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,685
我知道你们这些人只是玩玩
I understand you men were just playin' around.

131
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:45,390
但是骡…它不明白
But the mule... He just doesn't get it.

132
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,661
当然，如果你们道歉的话
Of course, if you were to all apologize.

133
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,948
你们笑，我觉得并不是很好
I don't think it's nice, you laughin'.

134
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:09,752
我的骡不喜欢别人笑
My mule don't like people laughin'.

135
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,087
它知道你们在笑它，它会很愤怒的
He gets the crazy idea you're laughin' at him.

136
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,822
现在，如果你们道歉的话，你们准备…
Now, if you apologize, like I know you're going to...

137
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:20,321
我会让它相信，你们不是有意的
I might convince him that you really didn't mean it.

138
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,696
我都看见了 你杀了他们四个
I saw the whole thing. You killed all four of them.

139
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,867
你会付出代价的 你会被绞死的
You'll pay all right. You'll be strung up.

140
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,002
你是谁？
Who are you?

141
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,004
别开枪
Don't fire a shot.

142
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:06,239
我叫约翰・巴克斯特，警长
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

143
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,782
是吗？如果你是警长的话
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff,

144
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,647
你最好把这些人埋了
you better get these men underground.

145
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,423
我说错了，四副棺材
My mistake. Four coffins.

146
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,549
我跟你说了我不是很便宜的
I told you I wasn't cheap...

147
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:51,021
但是我想你会觉得这是值得的
but I think you'll find it's worth your while.

148
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,787
97，98，99，啊
97, 98, 99, 100.

149
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:57,386
剩下的在你完成后再给
The rest when you're all done.

150
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,955
我什么时候开始？
When do I start?

151
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,867
我不急，至少现在
I'm not in a hurry, at least for the moment.

152
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:07,065
我会说跟巴克斯特在一起，现在做什么事情都不错
I'd say with four less Baxters, right now is as good a time to start as any.

153
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,270
我听说再过几天有一队骑兵经过这里
In a few days I hear there will be a troop of cavalry passing through here.

154
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,714
我不想让军队的人干扰我们的生意
I wouldn't want the military sticking their long noses into our business.

155
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,877
看来你的消息很灵通
You seem to be well informed.

156
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:25,615
在这些地方，人的生命经常依靠这些信息
In these parts, a man's life often depends on a mere scrap of information.

157
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:30,019
这个东西对他们的主人没什么大帮助
This thing couldn't have been very useful to its owner.

158
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:36,598
我兄弟雷蒙的 他经常用来做目标练习
My brother Ramon did that. He often uses it for target practice.

159
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,697
手里拿着枪，没有人敢挡住他
With a gun in his head, no one stands in his way.

160
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:43,469
这件装甲是他最喜欢的目标之一
The suit of armor is one of his favorite targets...

161
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:47,274
特别是没有什么其他东西来射的时候
Naturally when he does not have anything better to shoot.

162
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:51,476
我对见你的兄弟很有点兴致了
Well, I'll be kind of curious to meet this brother of yours.

163
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:57,956
这个是奇科，最可靠的人之一
This is Chico, one of the most trusted of my men.

164
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:01,118
跟着他，他会带你去你的房间
Follow him. He will bring you to your room.

165
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,720
希望你像在家里一样
I would like you to feel at home.

166
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:07,061
我还没有找到那么好的家，我们走
Well, I never found home that great, but let's go.

167
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,215
她是谁？
Who's that?

168
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:31,382
她叫玛丽莎 你最好忘了她
Her name's Marisol. You just forget about her.

169
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,789
这是你的房间
This one will be your room.

170
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:09,695
你给了他100美元
You gave him $100.

171
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:12,560
我们从来不付那么多钱
We never pay that much.

172
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,863
你能向我解释为什么接受他吗？
Can you explain to me why you have taken him on?

173
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:18,495
让那个恶心的外国佬呆在这里，还给他100美元？
To have that filthy gringo around the house and to give him $100 besides?

174
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:21,640
我们从来没给过那么高的价钱
We have never paid anybody so much

175
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,437
你不能把那样的人留在这里，做他想做的事情
You cannot leave someone like that to do what he wants around here.

176
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,978
他什么事情都可以做
He's capable of doing anything.

177
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:29,106
我想要这里有些秩序
And I want law and order in this place.

178
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:33,882
如果你想的只是那样的话，那么就更便宜了
If that is all you want, there is a much cheaper way.

179
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:36,114
杀掉他
Just snuff him out.

180
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,091
谁来呢？你？
And who would be the one? You?

181
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,150
是的，为什么不呢？
Yes, why not?

182
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:46,597
后面开枪，很容易就解决他了
A shot in his back, then you would have him out of the way in no time at all.

183
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:51,866
听着，我很容易就可以做到了
Listen, I could do it easily right now.

184
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:56,432
他不会想到的，我就可以拿回那一百元
He won't be expecting it, and I'd get back the hundred.

185
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:03,574
你真蠢，伊斯特班！ 即使你是我弟弟
You are stupid, Esteban! Even if you are my brother!

186
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,847
后面开枪，是吗？ 结束了
A bullet in the back, eh? And it is ended!

187
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,547
如果你的手打颤会怎样呢？
And what happens if your hand should tremble slightly?

188
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,351
就他受伤吗？
And he's only hurt?

189
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:16,157
而且骑兵很快就来到这里了
And with the cavalry arriving in town and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

190
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:19,130
- 我只是想… - 你什么都不要想
- I was only thinking... - You mustn't think of anything!

191
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:21,257
让我来想
You let me do the thinking instead.

192
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:26,101
去看看美国人 看看他需要什么，跟他交个朋友
Go and see the americano. Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.

193
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,668
你要记住一点
Get one thing clear in that head of yours.

194
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:33,109
在雷蒙回来之前不要发生任何事情
This is going to be a quiet town until Ramon gets back!

195
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:37,645
明白吗？别发生什么事情
Is that clear? A quiet town.

196
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:54,456
我是伊斯特班・罗吉 我哥哥叫我…
I am Esteban Rojo. My brother asked me to...

197
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,072
你在做什么呢？
What are you doing?

198
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,200
走
Moving.

199
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:07,805
但是你不知道我们所有的人都是住在一起的吗？
But didn't you know all our men live here with us?

200
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,881
是很舒适，但是我觉得你们并不是都很欢迎我
That's all very cozy, but I don't find you men all that appealin'.

201
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:19,654
而且，你哥哥说现在没什么事需要我做
Besides, your brother said he didn't have any need for me anymore right now.

202
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,513
停！
Halt!

203
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,625
- 军士？ - 什么事，长官？

204
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:52,289
告诉他们今晚我们在这里休息
Tell the men we'll be spending tonight here in this place.

205
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,589
安排一下，让他们补充一下东西
Arrange it so they can pick up the supplies here.

206
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,289
还有，加强警卫，守卫好马车
Also, double the guard in order to watch the stagecoach there.

207
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:59,025
是的
Yes, sir.

208
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,528
你觉得那马车里是什么呢？
What do you suppose they're carrying in that coach?

209
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,263
很容易查明
It'd be easy to find out.

210
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:07,000
走进它，然后看看里面是什么
Get up close to it and take a little look at what's in it.

211
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,976
如果他们向你开枪，那么里面就是金子
If they fire at you, you know it's gold.

212
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:12,273
不错的主意
Not a bad idea.

213
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:39,935
看什么呢？
Looking for anything?

214
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,875
你好
Hello.

215
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,878
离开这里，年轻人
Get out of here, Yankee.

216
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:00,526
你怎么没睡呢？
Why aren't you sleeping?

217
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:05,190
当你的眼神那样的时候，让我觉得不安
When I see you staring like that, it bothers me.

218
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,496
我还在想那马车里的是什么
I still keep wondering what was in that stagecoach.

219
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:11,663
肯定是什么他们认为很重要的东西
It's something they seem to think is very important.

220
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:16,004
我问了那统帅几个问题，差点被抓住了
I asked a few questions of the captain and almost was arrested.

221
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,042
玛丽莎是谁？
Who's Marisol?

222
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:23,507
你最好睡觉 你需要的
You better get some sleep. You need it.

223
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,051
这太危险了，即使是你
It's much too dangerous, even for you.

224
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:30,379
我只是问她是谁
All I did is ask who she was.

225
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,392
她是个女人
She is a woman.

226
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,895
雷蒙疯狂的爱上了她
And Ramon's madly in love with her.

227
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:37,988
现在明白了吧？
Does that make it clear to you?

228
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,795
镇里的每一个人都谈论雷蒙
Everybody in this town talks about Ramon.

229
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,997
真的很想见见他
Kind of curious to meet him.

230
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,741
如果你够聪明的话
If you are smart, you will try to stay

231
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:50,942
你会尽可能离他远点
clear of Ramon as long as possible.

232
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,211
那里有士兵 他们静静的前进着
There are the soldiers. They are moving on very quietly.

233
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,894
好奇怪
Strange.

234
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:10,555
他们跑向边境
They're headed for the frontier.

235
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,201
告诉我
Tell me...

236
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,836
你每晚都是这样睡觉的吗？
is that the way you go to bed every night?

237
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:24,978
别担心，我不会弄脏被单的
Don't worry. I didn't dirty the sheets.

238
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:28,745
等等，我也去
Wait. I'm coming too.

239
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:32,307
我想想看看你是怎样惹麻烦上身的
I want to see for myself how you're going to get yourself in trouble.

240
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,410
好的，好的，走
All right. All right. Go ahead.

241
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:22,228
就像玩牛仔和印第安人一样
It's like playing cowboys and Indians.

242
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,169
- 上尉 - 欢迎，中尉
- Captain. - Welcome, Lieutenant.

243
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:31,775
这是给你们的金子
There's your gold as promised.

244
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:35,440
希望你们给我们的枪对我们的军队有相同的用处
I hope the guns you will be giving us will be equally useful to our army.

245
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:38,883
放心，上尉 我们检查一下
Rest assured, Captain. We'll check them over together.

246
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:15,374
穿上他们的衣服，快点
Get their clothes on again, and hurry.

247
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,017
把他们放好
Be sure to place them around right.

248
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:21,076
记得，他们是互相战死的
Remember. They died fighting among themselves.

249
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,272
卢比奥！
Rubio!

250
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:48,942
那个，就是雷蒙
There. It's Ramon.

251
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:05,556
这是我的兄弟雷蒙
This is my brother Ramon.

252
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,658
我想我提过他了
I think I mentioned him.

253
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:09,669
每个人都在说雷蒙
Everybody talks about Ramon.

254
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:13,696
也有很多人说你，包括我亲爱的兄弟
And many speak of you, too, my dear brother included.

255
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:18,176
希望他们说的是好事
Well, I hope they say nice things.

256
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:20,235
你的旅途不错吧？
Did you have a good trip?

257
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,949
很无聊
It was tiring.

258
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:26,076
在路上的时候太热了
It was terribly hot on the road during the day.

259
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:30,350
坐马车不是很舒服
And stagecoaches are an uncomfortable way to travel.

260
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:33,791
我想很快你就会高兴起来了
Well, I'm sure you'll be in great shape in no time.

261
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:37,352
美国人已经迫不及待了
The americano cannot wait to get into action.

262
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,490
对不起 恐怕要让他伤心了
I am sorry. He's going to be a disappointed man.

263
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,034
怎么呢
How's that?

264
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:46,938
巴克斯特接受了邀请 他们今晚会来的，米吉尔先生
The Baxters accepted the invitation. They'll come tonight, Don Miguel.

265
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,201
巴克斯特来这里？ 你肯定是疯了
The Baxters coming here? You must be out of your head.

266
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:52,301
奇科是听我的命令的 我告诉他邀请他们过来
Chico followed my orders. I told him to invite them here.

267
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,403
雷蒙，这是什么意思？
Ramon, what is this?

268
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,215
在旅途之中我发现了很多新东西
I have found out many things when I was traveling...

269
00:28:58,284 --> 00:29:01,743
觉得我们这样彼此争斗，毫无结果
and I have decided that it's very stupid...

270
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:05,918
是非常愚蠢的
to just keep on shooting at each other and without any results.

271
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,392
你疯了，雷蒙
You've gone out of your mind, Ramon.

272
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,625
不，我很正常，伊斯特班
No, I have come to my senses, Esteban.

273
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,963
相信我
Believe me.

274
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,398
相信我
Trust me.

275
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,665
生活很宝贵
Life can be so precious.

276
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:23,471
浪费每一分钟都是愚蠢的，不是吗？
It's foolish to risk losing it every minute, no?

277
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:26,512
这个镇子的空间很大，足够所有的人生活
There's plenty of space for everybody in this town.

278
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,570
即使巴克斯特也是，是吗？
Even Baxters, hmm?

279
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,813
因为这样…
For this reason...

280
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:36,481
我决定把自己的枪挂到墙上
I've decided to hang my gun up on the wall.

281
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,616
我觉得雷蒙说得对
I think that Ramon has the right idea.

282
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:42,593
我，也厌倦了这些杀戮 必须停下来
I, too, am getting tired of these killings. They must stop.

283
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:46,793
这，真的很让人感动
This is all very, very touching.

284
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,027
你是说你不赞赏和平？
You mean you don't admire peace?

285
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:53,095
这对于你来说可能是很难理解的事情
It's not real easy to like something you know nothing about.

286
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:57,303
呆在桑・米吉尔，你会学会很多事情的
Stay in San Miguel and you may just profit from the experience.

287
00:29:57,377 --> 00:30:00,540
不，谢谢，我会走的
No, thanks. I'll be movin' on.

288
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,411
钱在这，米吉尔先生
Here's your money, Don Miguel.

289
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,754
我只是用了一点
I only used a small amount of it.

290
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:15,694
除非我觉得我赚到了，要不然我不会拿的
I don't like to take money unless I feel I've earned it.

291
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,356
现在，你为什么这么匆忙呢？ 你应该呆在这里
Now, why are you so hasty? You should stay here.

292
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,401
今晚你可以和我们一起吃晚饭
You might enjoy dining with us tonight.

293
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:26,929
因为我，巴克斯特有四个人死了
The Baxters have four men in the cemetery on account of me.

294
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:30,169
我想他们不会很希望看到我在场的
I don't think they'd appreciate my presence.

295
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:40,779
我不喜欢那个美国人，他太聪明了
I don't like that americano. He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

296
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:43,949
- 开枪的时候没人可以比的上他 - 我看得出来
- At shooting a gun no one can touch him. - I can see that.

297
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:47,960
长着那样脸的人拿枪，你可以猜测到两件事情
When someone with that face works with his gun, you may count on two things.

298
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:50,963
他开枪很快，但是他也很聪明
He's fast on the trigger, but he's also intelligent.

299
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,727
他对于你们来说太危险了，兄弟们
That makes him too dangerous for you, I think, my brothers.

300
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,598
既然他走了，你能向我们解释一下…
Now that he's gone, will you please explain that silly nonsense...

301
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,070
把枪搁在墙上，和巴克斯特和好的那些事情吗？
about hanging up your gun and making up with the Baxters?

302
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:05,874
你自己想不到吗？
Is it possible that you'll never be able to reach any conclusions on your own?

303
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:08,915
你们觉得我们政府和美国人不会发现尸体
Don't you think our government and the americanos will find those bodies...

304
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:11,075
然后开始调查吗？
and then start an investigation?

305
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,084
他们会调查的，好的…
They'll investigate, all right...

306
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:17,316
我们安静，容忍一会
and we'll be quiet and peacefully abide our time.

307
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,087
我们对于里奥・布拉沃的大屠杀一无所知，是吗？
We know nothing about the massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

308
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,458
我把尸体安排成…
I arranged for the bodies to be lying...

309
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,727
他们是对战死的
as if both companies killed each other.

310
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,393
你们觉得他们相信吗？
But do you think they'll believe it?

311
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,995
是的，我想是的
Yes, I think so.

312
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:34,164
因为如果他们找不到一些作案的团体…
Because if they don't find some guilty party...

313
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,573
他们只能取消调查
It would be a pretty good reason to call off the investigation.

314
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,374
是的，那么巴克斯特怎么办呢？
Yes, but what about the Baxters?

315
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:43,244
巴克斯特？
The Baxters?

316
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:46,217
他们只是想着和平共处
They want nothing more than to live in peace.

317
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,721
我们就暂时满足他们的想法
We'll let them have their own way for a while.

318
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,517
别理巴克斯特
Forget about the Baxters.

319
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,721
调查结束之后我们再好好对付他们
We'll take care of them later when the investigation finishes.

320
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,429
你的想法不错
That was a fine idea that you had.

321
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,437
有是了吗？
What was it again?

322
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:08,167
啊，是的，是的
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

323
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:12,804
巴克斯特在这边，洛乔斯在那边
The Baxters are on one side. The Rojos on the other.

324
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,274
你就在中间
And you'd be in the middle.

325
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,285
唯一的问题就是他们联合起来了
The only problem is that they've joined up.

326
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:25,257
现在你做不了什么了
Now you are without a job,

327
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,790
你没有钱付你的帐了
and you don't have money to pay me what you owe me.

328
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,351
你只能做一件事情 赶紧离开这里
There is only one thing for you to do. Leave here immediately.

329
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,455
我会忘记你欠我的
I will forget about what you owe me.

330
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:36,366
你离开桑・米吉尔，以后再也不要回来了
You leave San Miguel and never come back for the rest of your days.

331
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:40,372
哦，乔，我已经按照你说的修好了马车
Eh, Joe, I have prepared the wagon the way you asked me to.

332
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,534
后面还有两幅空棺材
It's sitting out in the back here with two empty coffins.

333
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,976
你想做什么呢？
What are you up to?

334
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:48,138
你想换职业了吗？
Are you changing your profession?

335
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:50,911
如果你想谋生的话，你可以更好的
If you want to go on living, you'd better.

336
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,978
我觉得，你会是个很好的护柩人
In my opinion, you'll make a fine pallbearer.

337
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:58,550
关了这里，跟我一起走，好吗？
Close this place and come with me, huh?

338
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,891
哦，关了，是吗？好了 我们去哪里呢？
Oh, close up, huh? It's done. Where are we going?

339
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:05,898
我想知道我们去哪里，这是秘密吗？
I'd like to know where we are going, or is it a secret?

340
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,259
到河下面去 找一些下面的尸体
Down by the river. Have a look at some corpses down there.

341
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:57,982
洛乔斯说吃晚饭，我们必须去
The Rojos say come to dinner and we must go.

342
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,612
布特一点也不喜欢那个
But I don't like it at all...

343
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:04,019
即使他们已经保证我们所要求的所有东西
even if they've granted all the guarantees we've demanded.

344
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,391
我们一起去，但是什么都不要碰
We'll go along with it, but don't touch anything.

345
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:12,990
你们不能吃，不能喝
You mustn't eat. You mustn't drink.

346
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:17,264
你们要注意一切东西，保持警惕
You just keep your eyes open and keep your wits about you.

347
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:45,561
你确定没有人看着我们？
Are you sure that nobody has seen us?

348
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,862
只有一两个鬼
Only a ghost or two.

349
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:50,802
不要开这样的玩笑
Don't joke about things like this.

350
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:54,671
鬼还是呆在他们的地方好
Ghosts are better left where they are.

351
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,767
看起来这个地方好像很适合你
You look as though this place suits you very well.

352
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,941
如果你再这样的话，你很快就会永远的呆在这里
If you go on like this, you will soon be here permanently.

353
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:15,253
我不明白
I do not understand.

354
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,428
为什么所有河流下面的尸体
Why is it with all those bodies down

355
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:18,958
你只埋其中的两具？
by the river we are just burying these two?

356
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,329
不是的，我们不埋
We're not. We're not gonna bury them.

357
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,767
不埋是什么意思呢？
What do you mean we're not burying them?

358
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:26,532
是的，我们不埋他们
That's right. We're not gonna bury them.

359
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:32,377
如果我们不埋的话，用他们做什么呢？
If we are not going to bury them, what will we use them for?

360
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:35,904
我们为什么要费力做这样的事情呢？
Why are we taking the trouble to do this?

361
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:38,416
死人有时很有用
The dead can be very useful sometimes.

362
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,948
他们可以帮助我们
They've helped me out of tough spots more than once.

363
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:53,427
首先他们不会说话
First, they don't talk.

364
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:58,635
其次，如果弄好的话，他们就像生的一样
Second, they can be made to look alive if I manage it right.

365
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:04,240
还有…
And, third...

366
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,478
如果你向他们开枪的话，别担心
Well, third, if you shot them, there's no worry,

367
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:08,839
因为他们已经死了
'cause they're dead already.

368
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,212
明白吗？
Understand?

369
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,650
我一点也不明白，我要走了
It doesn't make a bit of sense to me, and I'm getting out.

370
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,915
我活着，我还想活下去，明白吗？
I'm alive, and I want to remain with the living, understand?

371
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,047
当我死了，我就一直死着
And when I'm dead, I'll want to remain with the dead.

372
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:20,719
活着的人让我活起来我会不开心的
I would be unhappy if somebody living forces me to remain with the living.

373
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:23,353
希望我说的很清楚
I hope that's clear.

374
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:27,365
还有，我不喜欢你把他们放在这里的想法
And, also, I don't like the idea that you've placed those bodies there!

375
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:31,871
埋在那里的人只是那些得肺炎而死的人
The man buried there is the only one who died of pneumonia in this cursed town!

376
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,668
放松点，好吗？
Take it easy, will ya?

377
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,401
这两个我们的朋友会让我可以给你付钱
These two friends of ours here are gonna make me pay your bill.

378
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,474
走吧
Get up there!

379
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,705
他们开战的唯一理由只能是
The only reason they could have to start a war with us...

380
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:12,836
把你从我身边绑架走了
would be to kidnap you from your husband's side.

381
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:16,014
他太豪爽了，这个罗吉
He's gallant, this Rojo.

382
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:18,984
我觉得不能那样恭维他
I really didn't think him capable of compliments.

383
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:23,853
他不是 他所说的都是假的，就像他的提议
And he's not. All that he says is false, like his proposals.

384
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:28,827
你们这些女人！如果事情不复杂的时候，你们就怀疑了
You women! If things aren't complicated for you, you become suspicious.

385
00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:32,797
是的，因为对于我来说，事情不是很好
Yes, because to me, it just didn't seem right.

386
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:36,232
太顺利了 我不相信他们
It went too smoothly. I don't trust them.

387
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,794
你想证明我是错的，不是吗？
You'd like to prove me wrong, wouldn't you?

388
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:40,806
一直都是这样的
Always the same thing.

389
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:45,003
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

390
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,676
别担心 我不会伤害你的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt ya.

391
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:28,620
我只是想让你知道
I just want you to know why the

392
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:30,518
为什么洛乔斯这么急着和解
Rojos want to make peace all of a sudden.

393
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,626
有一群士兵拉着满车的黄金
There was once a wagon load of gold that the soldiers

394
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,956
去边界那
were taking to the border.

395
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:47,767
约翰，快点上来
John, come up here quickly.

396
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,815
对不起，但是当丈夫发现一个男人在自己妻子的卧室里
Sorry, but when a husband finds a man in his wife's bedroom...

397
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:00,910
你绝对不会知道他的反应会是怎样的
you're never sure how he's gonna react.

398
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,788
- 给他500美元 - 为什么？
- Give him $500. - How's that?

399
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:08,864
给他钱
Give the money to him.

400
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:12,092
他有个有趣的故事 听他说
He has an interesting story. Listen to him.

401
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,258
那是很好的故事 你不会不明白的
That's the right idea. You didn't misunderstand.

402
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,633
只有合适我的时候我才会误解
I get the wrong idea only when it suits me.

403
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,297
- 什么呢？ - 护送金子的士兵
- What is it? - The soldiers escorting the gold!

404
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:23,137
两个逃走了 他们躲在墓地里
Two of those soldiers got away. They are hiding out in the cemetery.

405
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,269
巴克斯特 他们想抓住他们
The Baxters. They're about to capture them.

406
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:30,612
叫他们集合
Get the men!

407
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:35,311
你的消息很灵通，是吗？
You are well informed, eh?

408
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:39,484
人的生命通常就靠信息
A man's life in these parts often depends on a mere scrap of information.

409
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:41,652
你兄弟自己说的
Your brother's own words.

410
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,195
告诉我，你为什么这样帮我们？
Tell me. Why are you doing this for us?

411
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,400
500美元
$500.

412
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,879
抓住这两个对雷蒙不利的士兵…
With these two soldiers as witnesses against Ramon...

413
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:03,643
政府会消灭洛乔斯，还有他们所有的人
the government will be able to rid the town of the Rojos and their whole band.

414
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,378
那时桑・米吉尔只有一个头
Then San Miguel will have just one boss.

415
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:07,886
快点！
Hurry!

416
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:24,492
我们走
Let's go!

417
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,039
跟我们一起去吗？
Coming with us?

418
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:31,743
当一个男人口袋里有钱的时候
When a man's got money in his pocket,

419
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,272
他开始欣赏和平
he begins to appreciate peace.

420
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:35,780
快点！
Come on!

421
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:47,642
我们把马放在这里
Let's leave the horses here.

422
00:42:09,374 --> 00:42:11,399
谁在那？出来
Who's there? Come out!

423
00:42:33,832 --> 00:42:35,857
你觉得怎样呢？
What do you think?

424
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:37,664
不知道
I don't know.

425
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:40,260
我不喜欢这样
There's something about it I don't like.

426
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:43,398
太安静了，不像受伤 像假人一样
Too still to be wounded. More like dummies.

427
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:44,772
当然，洛乔斯很感兴趣的家人
Sure, dummies that are very interesting to the Rojos.

428
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,873
最好藏起来，快点
Better hide. Hurry.

429
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:03,704
我们应该怎样做？
What'll we do?

430
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:06,017
让两个人绕到旁边
Take two men and circle around to the side.

431
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,023
和他们对战，然后我就可以把那两个人弄过来了
Try to keep them busy long enough for me to get those two down there.

432
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,822
继续，继续，快点
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

433
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,223
掩护 我去看看他们两个
Keep me covered. I am going to take care of those two.

434
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:33,401
听着，巴克斯特！ 现在，如果你想的话，你可以带他们走了
Listen, Baxter! You can have them now if you like!

435
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,235
因为死人是不会说话的
Since dead men can't talk!

436
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:50,487
看起来他们不喜欢我这个玩笑
It seems they didn't like my joke.

437
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:53,719
待会我们让他们回去吧
We'll let them go home in a little while.

438
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:39,471
我们把这个小子作为我们的客人…
We will keep this bad boy as our guest...

439
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:42,073
直到巴克斯特离开桑・米吉尔奔向边境
only until Baxter leaves San Miguel and heads for the frontier.

440
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,913
把他放到地下室去
Put him in the cellar.

441
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:52,285
做的不错
Good work!

442
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,525
用安东尼奥作我们的人质，巴克斯特只好让步了
With Antonio as our prisoner, the Baxters have to give in to us.

443
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:58,691
现在我们可以要求任何东西了
Now we can make any kind of demand.

444
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:08,365
发生什么事了？ 说话，可以吗？
What has happened? Talk, will you?

445
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:11,173
我不知道，但是有人向我开枪
I don't know, but somebody shot at me.

446
00:49:15,984 --> 00:49:18,214
你在哪，玛丽莎？
Where are you, Marisol?

447
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,733
很奇怪，你怎么老是在合适的时间出现呢？
It's strange how you always manage to be in the right place at the right time.

448
00:49:43,678 --> 00:49:46,216
没什么严重的 头疼会过去
It's nothing serious. A headache that will pass.

449
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,173
她会睡着的
She'll sleep.

450
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:57,516
盯着她，她不能离开那个房间 听到了吗？
Keep your eyes open. She's not to move from that room. You hear?

451
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:07,064
我不会说我是怎样带她来这里的
I wouldn't mention anything about me bringing her here.

452
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:10,434
我不想让洛乔斯因为我是你们的人
I wouldn't want the Rojos to think I was on your side.

453
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,063
别担心
Don't worry.

454
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,339
我是个富裕的女人，舍得花钱买值得买的人
I'm a woman who's rich enough to appreciate the men my money can buy.

455
00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:19,346
我已经跟洛乔斯说了
I've been to talk to the Rojos.

456
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:21,746
他们愿意用安东尼奥换玛丽莎
They'll give back Antonio in exchange for Marisol.

457
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:23,910
上午的时候开始
It'll take place in the morning.

458
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:29,719
你很快就会有钱了
Very soon you are going to be rich.

459
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:38,724
是的，那不会让我伤心的
Yeah, and that's not gonna break my heart.

460
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,199
她在哪？ 你说我可以看到她的
Where is she? You said I'd be able to see her!

461
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:27,935
她在哪？
Where is she?

462
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:30,204
我想看她
I wanna see her!

463
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:32,303
- 回这来，杰西，过来 - 我想看
- Come back here, Jesus. Come here. - I wanna see!

464
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,814
我想看她，我想看她
I want to see her! I want to see her!

465
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:38,215
我为什么不能看她呢？ 我想看她
Why can't I look at her? I want to see her!

466
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,235
去，去他那，玛丽莎
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

467
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:25,762
妈妈
Mama!

468
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:31,767
- 妈妈 - 杰西！
- Mama! - Jesus!

469
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:39,867
朱里奥！
Julio!

470
00:54:41,008 --> 00:54:42,498
对付朱里奥
Get Julio.

471
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:56,614
你被警告离开城镇
You were warned to get out of town.

472
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:59,819
现在我要你一次付清
Now I'm gonna make you pay once and for all.

473
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:03,192
别动他
Let him be!

474
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:44,894
你最好走 雷蒙在等着
You better get goin'. Ramon's waitin'.

475
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:52,879
还有，你，赶快带那个孩子回去
And, you, get that kid home where he belongs.

476
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:41,561
猪，那个雷蒙
A pig, that Ramon.

477
00:56:42,698 --> 00:56:45,427
雷蒙对他们做了什么呢？
What's Ramon got to do with them?

478
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:47,592
没有人告诉你，是吗？
You weren't told, eh?

479
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,203
在世界的这个地方，这个故事很久了
In this part of the world, the story is very old.

480
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:55,174
一个快乐的小家庭，然后麻烦出现了
A happy little family until trouble comes along.

481
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:57,177
麻烦的名字叫雷蒙
And trouble has the name of Ramon.

482
00:56:57,245 --> 00:56:59,907
说丈夫打牌的时候作弊了，这当然不是真的…
Claiming the husband cheated at cards, which wasn't true...

483
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:03,439
他把他的妻子抓来做人质
He gets the wife to live with him as hostage.

484
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:05,144
丈夫呢？
And the husband?

485
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:08,313
他？他什么都做不了
Him? There's nothing for him to do.

486
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:10,789
洛乔斯威胁说要杀了他的儿子杰西…
The Rojos threatened to kill his little boy Jesus...

487
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:13,520
他必须接受这些
and he was forced to accept things.

488
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,362
那个雷蒙很聪明
That Ramon is smart.

489
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,835
你去哪里呢？
Where are you going?

490
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:28,508
到洛乔斯找事做
To the Rojos to look for a job.

491
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:36,582
我很开心，美国人和我们在一起
I am glad we have the americano with us.

492
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:39,415
最好的事情都有可能发生在我们身上…
It's the best thing that could have happened to us, you know...

493
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:42,479
因为如果政府不进行调查的话
'cause if either government starts an inquiry...

494
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:44,547
我们需要招收大量的人
We'll need every man we can get.

495
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:49,258
我想你们应该知道现在和巴克斯特将会有场大战了…
I guess you know to be at war with the Baxters now...

496
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,663
这比坐在一大箱炸药上还糟糕
is worse than sitting on a big case of dynamite.

497
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:55,463
- 我们应该把这些放哪里呢？ - 放那
- Where should we put this? - Put it over there.

498
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,810
来，大家，喝！
Come on, everybody! Drink up!

499
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:39,044
好枪法，真的很好的枪法
Good shooting. Very good shooting.

500
00:58:39,113 --> 00:58:41,308
当你想杀人的时候，最好就是射他的心脏
When you want to kill a man, you must shoot for his heart.

501
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:44,215
温切斯特是最好的武器
And the Winchester is the best weapon.

502
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:47,721
那很不错，但是我还是坚持用我的a.45
That's very nice, but I'll stick with my a.45.

503
00:58:47,788 --> 00:58:51,417
当带a.45的人遇到用来复枪的人…
When a man with a.45 meets a man with a rifle...

504
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:55,121
拿着手枪的人会死
The man with the pistol will be a dead man.

505
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:58,165
那是一句古老的墨西哥谚语，那是真的
That's an old Mexican proverb, and it's true.

506
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:01,669
你相信吗？
You believe that?

507
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:06,231
来五个人送玛丽莎回小屋
Take five men and escort Marisol to the small house.

508
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,537
一直待到我回去
Stay there till I return.

509
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,849
- 一切都准备好了 - 不要担心
- Everything's prepared. - Do not be worried.

510
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,912
明天我会回来的
I will return tomorrow.

511
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,924
所有的马车都准备好了 我们可以走了
All the wagons are ready. We can leave.

512
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:28,928
大家，我不在的时候玩的尽兴
Everyone, enjoy yourselves during my absence.

513
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,315
你们听到雷蒙说的话了 我们要玩的尽兴
You heard Ramon. Let's have a good time.

514
01:00:12,873 --> 01:00:14,807
- 他有一吨重 - 是的
- He weighs over a ton. - Of course...

515
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,036
他喝得太多了
with all he poured into himself.

516
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:40,260
你不是跟我说谁都不能见妈妈的吗？
Did you not tell me no one could go see Mama?

517
01:01:41,495 --> 01:01:43,395
是的
That's right.

518
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:46,490
为什么那个人可以看她而我不能呢？
Then why does that man see her when I cannot?

519
01:01:49,604 --> 01:01:52,470
- 我要妈妈 - 不要站在门那里
- I want Mama. - Go away from the door.

520
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,509
安静点！我们不能让别人看到我们
Quiet! We cannot show ourselves.

521
01:01:55,576 --> 01:01:57,874
你必须记住这点 你必须离远点
You must remember that. You must stay away.

522
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,982
好啊
Hello.

523
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:32,637
有人在小房子那里开枪
There's somebody shooting up at the small house.

524
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:35,978
赶快上马 快点，我们走
Saddle the horses immediately! Come on. Let's go!

525
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:05,975
小心
Look out!

526
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,688
给！现在，拿着这些钱
Here you are. Now, take this money.

527
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:58,994
够你们过一段日子了 现在，穿过边境
It's enough to live on for a while. Now, get across the border.

528
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:01,762
离桑・米吉尔尽可能的远
Get as much distance between yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

529
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:04,895
我们要怎样多谢你呢？
How may we thank you for what you are doing?

530
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:07,669
不要了 在洛乔斯来到之前赶快离开这里
Don't try. Just get goin' before the Rojos get here.

531
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:14,080
你为什么这样帮我们呢？
Why do you do this for us?

532
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:19,016
为什么？ 因为我知道有人曾经喜欢过你
Why? 'Cause I knew someone like you once.

533
01:04:19,086 --> 01:04:21,281
那里没有帮助 现在，快走
There was no one there to help. Now, get movin'.

534
01:04:23,924 --> 01:04:26,119
离开这里
Get movin'.

535
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:28,961
离开这里
Get out of here!

536
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:13,303
怎么了，奇科？
What do you see, Chico?

537
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:16,810
他们都死了 他们屠杀了他们
They're all dead. They massacred them.

538
01:05:16,878 --> 01:05:20,609
他们绑架了玛丽莎！ 看来像是巴克斯特做的
- They kidnapped Marisol! - Looks like the work of the Baxters.

539
01:05:20,682 --> 01:05:23,981
快点，在他们攻击我们之前赶快回去
Quick, let's get back before they attack our house and the town.

540
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,862
奇科，把武器分下去
Chico, give out the ammunition.

541
01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:25,838
伊斯特班，让你的人防守房子 警惕点
Esteban, spread your men around the house. Keep your eyes open.

542
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:28,967
米吉尔、帕克、文森特、马丁，到后面去
Miguel, Paco, Vincente, Martin, behind the house.

543
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:32,945
阿瓦罗，跟我来 要警惕
Alvaro, come with me. Stay alert.

544
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:36,609
看他们杀了小房子的人，他们肯定有很多人
The way they killed the men in the small house, there must be a lot of them.

545
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:47,560
这是很热的晚上
It's a warm evening.

546
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:54,534
我们有辆马车坏了，所以我们必须回来找人帮助
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we had to turn back here to get help.

547
01:07:56,337 --> 01:07:59,795
有人告诉我…
One of the men tells me...

548
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:02,467
巴克斯特袭击了小房子
the Baxters attacked the small house.

549
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:05,946
你知道吗？
Do you know about it?

550
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:11,544
告诉我你所知道的
Tell me what you know.

551
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:35,775
你把玛丽莎藏哪了？
Where did you hide Marisol?

552
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,502
你很渴了 想喝点吗？
You are thirsty. You want to drink?

553
01:09:08,575 --> 01:09:11,807
不，不，现在喝还太早了
No, no, it is too soon to drink.

554
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:17,717
把他带过来
Bring him over here!

555
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:47,217
你就像一个顽固的白痴一样
You're behaving like a stubborn idiot.

556
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:49,178
告诉我们玛丽莎在哪
Tell us where Marisol is...

557
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,184
事情就结束了
and it will all be ended!

558
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:55,449
一个星期之后，你就复原了 你可以随便去哪里
In a week, you'll be back in shape. You can go wherever you want.

559
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,935
今天够了
That's enough for today.

560
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:12,996
很快，他会说出来的 只是时间的问题
Sooner or later, he'll talk. It's just a matter of time.

561
01:10:13,074 --> 01:10:15,235
小心别让他跑了或者死了
Watch out he doesn't escape or die otherwise.

562
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:23,776
等到他肯说出来 这样，他几乎就没什么感觉了
And wait till he comes to. This way, he hardly feels anything.

563
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:59,146
我已经想打牌想了三天了
I've had a poker hand waiting three days.

564
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:02,621
现在我要守在这里！ 当我看着这个美国白痴的时候我不能打牌
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it while I'm guarding this americano idiot!

565
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,885
你会觉得这比打牌要有趣的多
I think you will find this more amusing than cards.

566
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,189
所有的命令都不要他死…
All orders are to be sure he does not die...

567
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:10,719
但是也要让他后悔出生
and also make sure he regrets the day he was born.

568
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:15,261
那个外国佬睡着了
The gringo is asleep, I imagine.

569
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:17,599
是的 我会很高兴叫醒他的
That's all right. I'll enjoy waking him up.

570
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:25,502
- 伊斯特班，那是什么声音？ - 我不知道
- Esteban, what was that noise? - I do not know.

571
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:27,666
我听到了一声大叫，然后是撞击声
I heard a yell, and then a crash.

572
01:12:59,774 --> 01:13:01,708
躲起来是没用的
It's useless to hide.

573
01:13:03,844 --> 01:13:05,778
你快完了
You're finished playing the smart boy.

574
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:09,716
去看看阁楼那
Go up and look in the loft.

575
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:13,511
然后看看桶后面
And take a look behind the barrels!

576
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:27,466
我们离开这里
Let's get out of here!

577
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:39,710
快点！快点！
Hurry! Quick!

578
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:42,714
快弄水来！ 喂，你们，跟我走
Hurry with that water! Hey, you, come with me!

579
01:13:57,964 --> 01:14:01,628
包围城镇！ 封锁所有出去的街道
Surround the town! Block all the streets leading out!

580
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:03,636
给我找到他
Find him for me!

581
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,099
- 伊斯特班，搜索整个城镇 - 跟我走
- Esteban, search the whole town. - Follow me!

582
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:12,934
给我找回他来 不管什么代价
Get him back right now! You've got to at any cost!

583
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:16,574
看看马厩，所有的畜栏，所有的商店
Look in the stables, in every corral, in the stores!

584
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:18,584
还有教堂
Look for him in the church!

585
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:21,645
去那！ 每一寸都要搜到
Go in there! Search every inch of it!

586
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:25,088
搜索所有的地方！ 卢比奥，那里
Search everywhere! Rubio, in here!

587
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:28,617
如果有人藏他的话，把他们的房子烧了…
If somebody is hiding him, burn their house down...

588
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:30,720
像狗一样把他们杀了
and kill them like dogs!

589
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:32,924
你，上那
You, up here!

590
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:36,901
在巴克斯特附近看看，但是我要他是活的
Look for him near the Baxters, but I want him alive!

591
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,562
活的
Alive!

592
01:14:40,106 --> 01:14:42,336
卢比奥，酒店
Rubio, in the bar.

593
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:16,397
他说他什么都知道 他想表现的聪明
He says he knows nothing. He's trying to be smart.

594
01:15:16,476 --> 01:15:18,410
带到我这里来
Bring him here to me.

595
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:25,317
- 我在说实话 - 你什么都不知道，是吗？
- I'm telling the truth. - Well, you know nothing, huh?

596
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:30,455
你照顾他
You take care of him.

597
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,532
你把他藏哪里了？
Where have you hidden him?

598
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:17,835
我没有藏起他
I didn't hide him.

599
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,470
你是那个卑劣的美国人的朋友
You're the right friend for that filthy americano.

600
01:16:25,545 --> 01:16:27,479
你也会被同样解决的
You'll end up the same way.

601
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:30,506
我们找遍了所有的地方
We looked everywhere.

602
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,347
地下室，阁楼，房顶
In his cellar, in the attic, on the roof.

603
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,547
没有什么踪迹
There is no trace.

604
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:37,648
后面的房间里也没什么人
I couldn't find anybody in the back room.

605
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:40,694
我想他肯定是求助巴克斯特了
I'm certain he has taken refuge with the Baxters.

606
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,424
那个美国人不蠢 他是那是最好的地方
The americano isn't stupid. He knows that's the best place to hide.

607
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:49,534
巴克斯特，是吗？
The Baxters, eh?

608
01:16:50,604 --> 01:16:52,697
最好去抓住他
Then better go and get him.

609
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:58,678
这是做他朋友的惩罚
And that's for being his friend.

610
01:17:33,313 --> 01:17:34,905
该死的
Curse them.

611
01:18:04,043 --> 01:18:06,604
- 过来 - 我看不到人
- Come here. - I can't see anybody.

612
01:18:08,014 --> 01:18:09,607
过来
Come here.

613
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:21,854
你在里面什么呢？
What are you doing in there?

614
01:18:21,928 --> 01:18:24,158
别介意 帮我出来
Never mind. Get me out of here.

615
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,699
但是你还没有死
But you're not dead yet.

616
01:18:26,766 --> 01:18:28,005
如果你不帮我出去的话，我会的，快点
I will be if you don't get me out of here, quick.

617
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:30,703
盖上盖子
Get that lid down.

618
01:20:21,314 --> 01:20:24,147
有人还活着
I see some signs of life.

619
01:20:24,217 --> 01:20:26,777
我们准备好，有人很快就出来了
Let's be ready when they decide to come out.

620
01:20:31,157 --> 01:20:33,455
不要开枪！我们投降
Don't shoot! We surrender!

621
01:20:36,095 --> 01:20:39,792
住手！别开枪！我们出来！
Stop! Don't shoot! We're coming out!

622
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:46,396
- 我投降！别开枪！ - 别开枪！
- I surrender! Hold back your fire! - Don't shoot!

623
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:49,066
我们投降
We surrender!

624
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:18,801
住手
Stop.

625
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,805
我想看看这个
I wanna take a look at this.

626
01:22:57,704 --> 01:23:01,606
雷蒙，别开枪！ 我们就出来
Ramon, don't shoot! We're coming out!

627
01:23:05,178 --> 01:23:06,907
我们投降
We surrender!

628
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:09,846
听着，你赢了 够了
Listen, you've won. It's enough!

629
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:12,476
我会离开这里的 你要我怎样做都行
I'll get out of town! I'll do whatever you like!

630
01:23:12,552 --> 01:23:15,419
- 你保证吗？ - 我发誓
- You promise that? - I swear it!

631
01:23:15,488 --> 01:23:17,422
你不会撒谎吧？
You won't try a trick of any kind?

632
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:20,688
不！绝对不会的
None! No, no tricks!

633
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,251
我说过了，我保证 我们会离开的
I said before, I give you my word. We'll leave!

634
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:26,992
你确定吗？ 你最好先征得你老婆的同意
Are you sure? You had better ask permission of your wife.

635
01:23:28,635 --> 01:23:31,262
可能她不会太高兴
Maybe she won't be too happy!

636
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:14,672
凶手
Murderers.

637
01:24:16,215 --> 01:24:18,843
他们没有枪
They had no guns.

638
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:22,012
凶手！ 你们下地狱去吧
Murderers! I hope you rot in hell!

639
01:24:22,088 --> 01:24:25,524
愿你和你的兄弟流血死去！ 你们会受到诅咒的
May you and your brothers die spitting blood! Curse you for this!

640
01:24:25,591 --> 01:24:28,321
凶手！
Murderers!

641
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,241
我们走！ 总之节目已经结束了
Let's go. The show's over anyway.

642
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:00,524
再找找他 找遍每一车尸体
Keep looking for him. Search among those bodies.

643
01:25:01,561 --> 01:25:03,825
那个美国人肯定在
The filthy americano has to be somewhere!

644
01:27:29,141 --> 01:27:31,132
西尔瓦尼托在哪呢？
Where's Silvanito?

645
01:27:33,746 --> 01:27:35,941
今天有什么新闻？
Any news today?

646
01:27:36,015 --> 01:27:38,882
我必须告诉你坏消息
I have to tell you some news that's pretty bad.

647
01:27:38,951 --> 01:27:42,478
- 我必须告诉你这些，但是… - 西尔瓦尼托在哪呢？
- I hate to tell you this, but... - Where is Silvanito?

648
01:27:44,857 --> 01:27:47,985
今天早上他被雷蒙的人抓住了
He was captured this morning by those men of Ramon's.

649
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,120
他们在镇外面抓住他的 他正往这边走
They grabbed him outside the village. He was on his way to this mine.

650
01:27:51,197 --> 01:27:54,223
他早就有预感了 现在雷蒙抓住他了
He was bringing in some provisions. Ramon's got him now.

651
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,291
他被折磨，但是他不会说出来的
He's being tortured, but he won't talk.

652
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:58,302
我很了解他 他是顽强的人
I know him well. He's a stubborn man.

653
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:02,397
不管他们怎么做，他一句话都不会说的，即使会没命
No matter what they do, he won't say a word, even if it means his life.

654
01:28:02,475 --> 01:28:05,501
听我说，他们绝对强迫不了他的
Listen to me. They'll never be able to force him.

655
01:28:16,656 --> 01:28:19,819
现在，愚蠢的家伙，松开你的舌头
Now, fool, loosen up your tongue.

656
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:30,099
你最好回你的店里
You better get back to your shop, old man.

657
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:33,161
- 你会有生意了 - 啊，太好了
- You're liable to have some business. - Ah, very good!

658
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:35,173
我就想听到这些
That's what I wanted to hear.

659
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:38,472
我给你带来一些小礼物
And I have a little surprise for you that I brought along.

660
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:39,415
我知道你很需要它！
I know how much you'll need it.

661
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:42,139
我花了很大的劲才弄到手的
It was very hard to get my hands on.

662
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:46,742
我第一次用自己的脑子 没有人可以忍受两桶酒的诱惑
I got it by first using my head. No one can resist two barrels of wine.

663
01:28:46,819 --> 01:28:49,344
这样对吗 然后我想…
Isn't that right? Then I thought that...

664
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:53,256
你可能需要那把枪，我买了另外一个礼物
well, you might need that pistol, and I brought another present.

665
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:59,363
是炸药 我从洛乔斯那里偷来的
It's dynamite. I stole it from the Rojos.

666
01:28:59,432 --> 01:29:03,425
我想现在是你点燃导火线
And now it seems to me the moment's come for you to light the fuse...

667
01:29:03,502 --> 01:29:05,493
送回给他们的时候了
and send it back to them.

668
01:29:25,057 --> 01:29:26,991
光线还很强烈
Still lots of light.

669
01:29:30,463 --> 01:29:33,330
现在睡觉还太早了
Too early to be asleep yet.

670
01:29:37,269 --> 01:29:38,861
卢比奥，来
Rubio, here.

671
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:48,744
我不想弄坏了来复枪 我还没找到像这把这么好的
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle. I could never find another like this.

672
01:29:50,249 --> 01:29:52,580
听着，我们现在试试这个
Listen, let's try it with this one now.

673
01:31:58,177 --> 01:32:00,542
外国佬！
Gringo!

674
01:32:06,652 --> 01:32:09,086
听说你想见我
Heard you wanted to see me.

675
01:32:09,155 --> 01:32:11,487
美国佬已经死了
The americano's dead.

676
01:32:13,591 --> 01:32:15,525
放下他
Let the old man down.

677
01:32:33,378 --> 01:32:36,472
怎么了，雷蒙？
What's wrong, Ramon?

678
01:32:36,548 --> 01:32:38,482
怎么没打到呢？
You losing your touch?

679
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:49,457
你在害怕吗，雷蒙？
Are you afraid, Ramon?

680
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:55,364
“杀人的话，最好向心脏开枪”
"You shoot to kill, you better hit the heart."

681
01:32:55,434 --> 01:32:58,130
你自己说的
Your own words.

682
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:16,610
心脏
The heart.

683
01:33:16,689 --> 01:33:18,623
不要忘记了心脏
Don't forget the heart.

684
01:33:21,794 --> 01:33:23,989
朝心脏开枪，要不然你阻止不了我的
Aim for the heart or you'll never stop me.

685
01:35:01,393 --> 01:35:04,885
当带着a.45的人遇到带着来复的人…
When a man with a.45 meets a man with a rifle...

686
01:35:04,964 --> 01:35:07,591
你说那个拿着手枪的人死
You said the man with the pistol's a dead man.

687
01:35:09,034 --> 01:35:11,628
我们看看是不是真的
Let's see if that's true.

688
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,458
动手啊，上弹开枪
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

689
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:45,016
喂，听着，乔
Hey, listen, Joe.

690
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,923
听着，我…
Listen, l-l...

691
01:38:23,295 --> 01:38:28,428
看到黄金回来了，你们的政府会很开心的
Well, guess your government will be glad to see that gold back.

692
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:32,869
还有你，你不想再呆下来，是吗？
And you, you don't want to be here when they get it, eh?

693
01:38:34,572 --> 01:38:37,598
你是说墨西哥政府在一边
You mean the Mexican government on one side...

694
01:38:37,676 --> 01:38:40,236
可能美国政府在另外一边？
and maybe the Americans on the other side?

695
01:38:40,312 --> 01:38:43,145
我，就在中间？
Me, right smack in the middle?

696
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:45,479
嗯 太危险了
Mm-mmm. Too dangerous.

697
01:38:47,052 --> 01:38:48,644
再见
So long.
