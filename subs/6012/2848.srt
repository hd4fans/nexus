1
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:37,134
You're from Baker?

2
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,397
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

3
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:54,610
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

4
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,613
I know nothing about that case of coins.

5
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:03,076
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

6
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,788
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

7
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:09,124
They couldn't uncover any more.

8
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,085
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

9
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,631
Go back and tell him that.

10
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:20,427
Word's around you had a visitor.

11
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,138
And Baker knows it.

12
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:27,059
Name of Jackson.

13
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,271
Well?

14
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,815
Jackson was here.

15
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,403
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

16
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:47,538
He's not wrong.

17
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:52,376
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

18
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,587
about the cash box.

19
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,510
That's not what I'm being paid for.

20
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:09,643
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

21
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,982
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

22
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:18,026
I would have found him already.

23
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,488
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

24
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:24,658
That's why they pay me.

25
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,331
What is Baker paying you?

26
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,754
That your family?

27
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,472
Yes.

28
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:51,059
Nice family.

29
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:55,355
What does he pay you for murdering me?

30
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:02,112
500 dollars, to get the name.

31
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,454
The name.

32
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,090
Carson... Bill Carson.

33
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:25,719
That's what he calls himself now.

34
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:58,627
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

35
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,091
A thousand dollars?

36
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:11,097
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

37
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,103
But when I'm paid...

38
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:20,315
I always see the job through.

39
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:35,473
It's you. Any information?

40
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,437
Too much.

41
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,481
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

42
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:46,276
And one or two things that interested me.

43
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,528
Such as?

44
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:52,532
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

45
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,413
That's your bit.

46
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,750
Keep talking.

47
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,712
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

48
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,757
which just happened to disappear.

49
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,759
That's my bit.

50
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,969
Anything else?

51
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:15,305
Not enough for you, eh?

52
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:19,476
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

53
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,270
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

54
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,565
Here... Here you are.

55
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:29,110
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

56
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:31,696
Worth 500 dollars.

57
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,202
Yeah. I almost forgot.

58
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:39,746
He gave me a thousand.

59
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,999
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

60
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:54,969
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

61
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,846
You know that.

62
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,724
No! AngeI Eyes!

63
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:46,020
No. No pistoI, amigo.

64
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:50,275
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

65
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,124
Hey, amigo...

66
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,462
You know you got a face beautifuI enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

67
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:16,301
Yeah...

68
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:20,555
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

69
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,731
A couple of steps back.

70
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:25,620
Thank you.

71
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:36,714
How much are you worth now?

72
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,800
How much?

73
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,719
2,000 dollars.

74
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:45,890
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

75
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,684
2,000 dollars.

76
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:58,444
!Hijo de puta que te pari?
You'll pay for this!

77
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:01,030
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

78
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:04,117
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

79
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

80
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:12,125
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

81
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,627
Cut me loose!

82
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,633
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

83
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,802
Let me go.

84
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:27,640
I feeI sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

85
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:32,645
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

86
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,944
You swine!

87
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:43,489
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

88
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:47,118
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

89
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,954
Come back and fight.

90
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:51,914
You bastard.

91
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:56,752
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

92
00:20:56,836 --> 00:21:00,506
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

93
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,884
I'm innocent of everything.

94
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,721
So you're an honest farmer?

95
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,348
You recognise this man?

96
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:12,310
Yeah, it's you.

97
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:16,397
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

98
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,776
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

99
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,405
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

100
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,908
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

101
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:33,372
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

102
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:37,543
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

103
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,503
You know who you are?

104
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,964
Want to know whose son you are?

105
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,508
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

106
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:48,137
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

107
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,015
And your mother, she's...

108
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:53,476
You bastard!

109
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,189
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

110
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:04,362
Wanted in 14 counties of this state,
the condemned is found guilty

111
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:11,535
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery
of citizens, state banks and post offices,

112
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,539
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

113
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:20,419
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

114
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:23,005
inciting prostitution, kidnapping,

115
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,593
extortion, receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

116
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:32,765
passing counterfeit money, and,
contrary to the laws of this state,

117
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:37,311
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards...

118
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:41,482
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

119
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:44,568
we sentence the accused here before us,

120
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:48,447
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez...

121
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:51,659
Known as "The Rat".

122
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,496
.. to hang by the neck untiI dead.

123
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:59,125
May God have mercy on his souI.
Proceed.

124
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,194
Five for you.

125
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:31,448
One, two, three, four... five for me.

126
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:37,997
Five for you and five for me.

127
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,416
Know how much you're worth now?

128
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:43,961
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

129
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:50,718
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

130
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:55,306
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

131
00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:00,269
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

132
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:04,064
So the next time I want more than half.

133
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:08,777
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

134
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,074
If we cut down my percentage...

135
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,410
Cigar?

136
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:19,872
.. liable to interfere with my aim.

137
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:26,003
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

138
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:30,090
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

139
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:34,136
he understands nothing about Tuco.

140
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,305
Nothing.

141
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,602
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

142
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:45,397
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

143
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:48,942
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

144
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:53,030
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

145
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:58,118
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

146
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,580
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

147
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,248
derailing a train...

148
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,959
Hey, AngeI Eyes.

149
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,469
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

150
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:19,765
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

151
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:24,770
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

152
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:27,398
What wasn't saved was the coins.

153
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:31,443
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

154
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:34,363
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

155
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:38,617
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

156
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,497
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

157
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,375
Where is Carson?

158
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,670
AII I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

159
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:54,091
He lives with a girI called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

160
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,428
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

161
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,304
Someplace fairly near.

162
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,142
Santa Ana.

163
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,398
Adios, half-soldier.

164
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:15,028
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

165
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,364
.. and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

166
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:20,534
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

167
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:22,870
and, after receiving payment in advance,

168
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:26,415
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

169
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:30,335
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

170
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,007
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

171
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,178
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angeI.

172
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:50,022
A golden-haired angeI watches over him.

173
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,942
For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

174
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:57,571
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck untiI dead.

175
00:26:57,654 --> 00:27:00,532
May the Lord have mercy on his souI.
Proceed.

176
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:19,176
Let's get the hell out of here!

177
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:52,501
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

178
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:54,628
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

179
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:58,090
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

180
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:03,470
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feeI the deviI bite your ass.

181
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:07,557
Yeah. You're right.

182
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:10,310
It's getting tougher.

183
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:16,983
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

184
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:18,360
What do you mean?

185
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:22,364
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

186
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:25,409
What do you mean?

187
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:28,328
I mean our partnership is untied.

188
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:31,415
Oh, no, not you.

189
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:33,291
You remain tied.

190
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:36,378
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

191
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:40,590
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

192
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:43,677
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

193
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:47,973
If you save your breath,
I feeI a man like you could manage it.

194
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:49,808
Adios.

195
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:53,103
You filthy bastard! Come here!

196
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,567
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

197
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,903
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

198
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:06,992
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

199
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,619
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

200
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:16,042
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

201
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,717
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

202
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,761
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

203
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:30,682
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

204
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:34,186
!Hijo de una gran puta!

205
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:58,084
I believe madam is home.

206
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:00,253
Sweet dreams.

207
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,850
You filthy rats!

208
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:31,785
Maria?

209
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:40,961
Is that you, Bill?

210
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:42,963
Bill!

211
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,924
Arh!

212
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:53,974
Who are you?

213
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,017
What do you want with me?

214
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:59,437
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

215
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,232
I don't know him.

216
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:05,568
You were calling to him in the dark.

217
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:10,532
Where is he?

218
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,951
What are you gonna do to him?

219
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:16,538
I'll ask the questions.

220
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:20,750
Where is he?

221
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:29,384
Where is he? Where?

222
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:32,178
Where? Where?

223
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,556
Where?

224
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,436
That's enough.

225
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:43,982
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

226
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:47,402
and went away with his unit. They all left.

227
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,654
Which company? Where did they go?

228
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:53,700
Hm?

229
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:58,705
3rd Cavalry. GeneraI Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

230
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:03,001
That's all I know. I swear.

231
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,505
But... but...

232
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:37,345
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

233
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:39,097
Mm-hm.

234
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:19,429
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

235
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,934
Revolvers.

236
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:29,272
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

237
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:36,696
Here, Remington, Colt,

238
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:39,574
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

239
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:43,953
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

240
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,247
another Remington, and this one...

241
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,790
That's enough.

242
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,461
Cartridges.

243
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,515
- You wanna try the pistoI, step out back.
- Let's go.

244
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,647
Move, move.

245
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,557
Cartridge.

246
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,568
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

247
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,655
No.

248
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:30,411
Fifty dollars.

249
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:34,957
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

250
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:41,172
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

251
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:43,340
Here.

252
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,820
Come here.

253
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,578
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

254
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:18,334
- Heh?
- Mm-hm.

255
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:28,135
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

256
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:11,762
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

257
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:40,291
Potatoes.

258
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,295
You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.

259
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,339
Really poor.

260
00:39:47,423 --> 00:39:50,968
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

261
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,098
The world is divided into two parts:

262
00:39:56,181 --> 00:40:02,187
those who have friends,
and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

263
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:08,694
You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.

264
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:13,198
Chico and Ramón, his two brothers,
were my friends too.

265
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,955
But who knows where they are now?

266
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:24,501
Ah, it's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

267
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:26,879
I had a good deaI for you.

268
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:33,093
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got 4,000 dollars.

269
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:39,516
4,000 dollars.
And I know where to find it.

270
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:47,316
If they would help me catch him,
I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.

271
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,111
1,000 dollars each. Hm?

272
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:11,423
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

273
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,762
And rich. Like you're going to be.

274
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:19,765
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

275
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,101
And people talk bullshit.

276
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:29,149
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

277
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:32,569
And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.

278
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:34,738
Vamos.

279
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:53,048
This morning I heard the whole thing.

280
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:58,303
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

281
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:01,098
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

282
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:04,643
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

283
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:08,605
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

284
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:13,986
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

285
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,446
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

286
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,408
And they're going to beat the South.

287
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:24,705
Look. See that one with the white beard,
GeneraI Sibley? He looks dead.

288
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,790
He's finally getting out of our hair.

289
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:31,753
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

290
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:38,552
Where's the owner of that horse?

291
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:41,805
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

292
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:46,893
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

293
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:52,065
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

294
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:55,027
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

295
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,697
You stay quiet, old hen.

296
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,951
Upstairs in room four, señor.

297
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,334
Hear that?

298
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:18,967
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

299
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:35,205
Your spurs.

300
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:52,222
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

301
00:46:52,305 --> 00:46:57,769
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

302
00:46:57,852 --> 00:47:00,980
Take off that pistoI belt.

303
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:08,905
It's empty.

304
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:14,828
Mine isn't.

305
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:23,586
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

306
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:29,300
That could be cannon fire.

307
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:33,930
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

308
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:39,352
You ever see this before, my friend?

309
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:50,989
Throw it over the roof beam.

310
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:53,116
That's it.

311
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:06,880
Now get on that.

312
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:18,600
That's right.

313
00:48:18,683 --> 00:48:21,185
Now make sure the rope is tight.

314
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:24,397
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

315
00:48:30,695 --> 00:48:34,198
Now put the rope around your neck.

316
00:48:40,038 --> 00:48:42,874
That's very good.

317
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:46,794
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

318
00:48:46,878 --> 00:48:51,132
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

319
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,262
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stooI.

320
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:02,894
Adiós.

321
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,043
Welcome, my friend.

322
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:17,630
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

323
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:21,217
Our hoteI is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

324
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,388
And the attractions don't stop there.

325
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,684
InternationaI cuisine,
healthfuI and nutritious food.

326
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:31,852
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

327
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:34,438
Our government has spared no expense.

328
00:52:34,522 --> 00:52:37,400
As you can see, we are treated very well.

329
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:41,070
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

330
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:46,325
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

331
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:50,746
Well, you see, he's a Yankee coloneI
who decided to tear us to pieces.

332
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,916
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

333
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:56,919
And you ask me if I know someone.

334
00:52:57,002 --> 00:53:01,173
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

335
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:16,105
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the 3rd.

336
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:21,902
If he's with the 3rd...
They've already left.

337
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:23,612
For Glorietta.

338
00:53:23,696 --> 00:53:27,908
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

339
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:33,914
And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

340
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:36,542
And what if they were still alive?

341
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:41,130
Worse.

342
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:44,884
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

343
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:50,848
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

344
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:53,434
Keep it. It's yours.

345
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:22,249
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

346
00:56:22,332 --> 00:56:24,918
guilty of the following crimes:

347
00:56:25,002 --> 00:56:29,590
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

348
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:45,856
And Shorty?

349
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:51,778
No.

350
00:56:52,988 --> 00:56:55,616
No?

351
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:59,661
.. alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck untiI dead.

352
00:56:59,745 --> 00:57:03,040
May God have mercy on his souI.
Proceed.

353
00:57:09,546 --> 00:57:11,215
Sorry, Shorty.

354
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:15,344
Move. Come on, let's go.

355
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:42,996
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

356
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,961
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

357
00:58:12,317 --> 00:58:16,154
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

358
00:58:17,155 --> 00:58:19,533
Where are we going?

359
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:21,118
Where?

360
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:23,662
Where I'm going, amigo.

361
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,539
Over that way.

362
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:29,459
Another 100 miles
of beautifuI sun-baked sand.

363
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:32,212
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

364
00:58:32,295 --> 00:58:34,881
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

365
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:38,135
Canby's men are coming here.

366
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:42,180
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

367
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:44,975
Except you and me.

368
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,521
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

369
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:55,527
What was it you told me the last time?

370
00:58:56,778 --> 00:59:01,575
If you save your breath,
I feeI a man like you could manage it.

371
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:07,205
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

372
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,918
Very slowly, old friend.

373
00:59:15,964 --> 00:59:17,758
After you, please.

374
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:19,926
Start walking.

375
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,836
Taking a rest?

376
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:22,674
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

377
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:27,721
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

378
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:30,348
That's not too bad.

379
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:32,726
Come on.

380
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:18,605
Whoa...

381
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:25,838
OK, let's eat.

382
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:29,676
That is, I'll eat.

383
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:35,682
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

384
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:46,150
You want some water?

385
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:51,656
Drink.

386
01:03:57,662 --> 01:03:59,872
Come on.

387
01:04:40,872 --> 01:04:44,250
Well, Blondie... So long.

388
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:53,945
And so, Blondie...

389
01:05:55,571 --> 01:05:58,074
it's goodbye.

390
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:56,173
Whoa, whoa...

391
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,597
Easy, easy.

392
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,433
Easy. Attaboy.

393
01:09:34,415 --> 01:09:36,500
Water...

394
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:48,846
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

395
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:54,727
What's that you say?

396
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:58,564
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

397
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:02,067
My name is Bill Carson now.

398
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:04,904
Surprise attack...

399
01:10:04,987 --> 01:10:09,533
All dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

400
01:10:09,617 --> 01:10:13,037
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

401
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,834
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

402
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:21,920
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

403
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:24,882
Baker has nothing.

404
01:10:24,965 --> 01:10:28,761
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

405
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,890
Where? Here?

406
01:10:32,973 --> 01:10:37,061
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

407
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:38,854
Which cemetery?

408
01:10:38,937 --> 01:10:42,608
The one on Sad Hill.

409
01:10:42,691 --> 01:10:44,943
There's a grave...

410
01:10:45,027 --> 01:10:48,072
Which grave? Have a name?

411
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:52,951
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

412
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:56,080
There's... no number.

413
01:10:56,163 --> 01:10:58,707
There's a name.

414
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:01,293
It's written...

415
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:10,594
Water...

416
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:14,515
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

417
01:11:14,598 --> 01:11:17,726
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

418
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:23,899
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1,000... 5,000...

419
01:11:27,403 --> 01:11:31,448
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

420
01:11:31,532 --> 01:11:35,244
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

421
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:38,288
Don't die untiI later, you son of a...

422
01:12:03,355 --> 01:12:06,483
Get away from there.

423
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:13,198
He's dead.

424
01:12:16,493 --> 01:12:18,996
I'll kill you.

425
01:12:20,956 --> 01:12:24,877
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

426
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,088
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

427
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:32,885
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

428
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:36,096
What did he tell you?

429
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,557
A name.

430
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,936
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

431
01:12:56,325 --> 01:12:58,410
Blondie... Don't die.

432
01:12:58,493 --> 01:13:00,579
Blondie, don't die.

433
01:13:00,662 --> 01:13:03,373
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

434
01:13:03,457 --> 01:13:06,001
I'm your friend. Come on.

435
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:07,669
Come on, eh?

436
01:13:07,753 --> 01:13:11,214
Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.

437
01:13:11,298 --> 01:13:14,259
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

438
01:13:14,343 --> 01:13:18,221
Don't die like that pig.

439
01:13:18,305 --> 01:13:20,390
Here's water, Blondie.

440
01:13:20,474 --> 01:13:24,102
Don't drink, it's no good for you.
FeeI better?

441
01:13:24,186 --> 01:13:28,398
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die.

442
01:13:36,698 --> 01:13:40,118
Hey, open up! Hurry!

443
01:13:40,202 --> 01:13:43,330
Settle down. Who's there?

444
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:49,044
What do you mean, "who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

445
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:55,217
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

446
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,551
Come on.

447
01:13:56,635 --> 01:14:00,180
Sergeant, listen to
this corporaI for a moment.

448
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:06,103
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

449
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:11,566
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

450
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,694
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

451
01:14:13,777 --> 01:14:18,615
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and travelling papers.

452
01:14:19,741 --> 01:14:23,787
Here. CorporaI Bill Carson.
3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

453
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:27,582
arriving from San RafaeI.
Is that enough?

454
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:34,673
Are you reading when this man is dying?

455
01:14:34,756 --> 01:14:38,552
Why, CorporaI, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

456
01:14:38,635 --> 01:14:42,764
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

457
01:14:43,432 --> 01:14:47,018
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

458
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,814
Apache Canyon?

459
01:14:50,897 --> 01:14:53,400
Is a mission San Antonio around here?

460
01:14:53,483 --> 01:14:55,652
18 miles south. Take him there.

461
01:14:55,735 --> 01:14:59,406
The brothers take care of any wounded,
whatever the colour of his uniform.

462
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:02,492
And keep your eyes open -
the area is full of Yankees.

463
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:04,161
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

464
01:15:04,244 --> 01:15:06,246
Take care.

465
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:27,017
Whoa!

466
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:33,315
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

467
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:35,901
Let him have yours.

468
01:15:40,822 --> 01:15:44,951
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

469
01:15:45,035 --> 01:15:47,454
He should be back any day now.

470
01:15:47,537 --> 01:15:51,708
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

471
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,627
And may God be praised.

472
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:59,299
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

473
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:04,638
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

474
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:06,806
You're heavy.

475
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:19,694
There.

476
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:51,559
All right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

477
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:55,313
Put him in my cell.

478
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:57,482
Easy.

479
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:02,195
Out, soldier. Out you go.

480
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:06,116
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

481
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:12,747
Hey, Father, I...

482
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:29,264
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

483
01:17:58,168 --> 01:18:01,129
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

484
01:18:01,212 --> 01:18:02,964
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

485
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:08,261
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

486
01:18:08,344 --> 01:18:10,680
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

487
01:18:10,763 --> 01:18:13,475
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

488
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:16,186
Thanks be to Jesus.

489
01:19:04,984 --> 01:19:06,277
Blondie?

490
01:19:11,824 --> 01:19:14,953
Hey, Blondie?

491
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:37,517
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

492
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,437
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

493
01:19:41,521 --> 01:19:45,108
Think if you'd been on your own.

494
01:19:45,191 --> 01:19:50,571
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

495
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:55,868
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

496
01:19:55,952 --> 01:20:01,624
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

497
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,627
Not even a mother.

498
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:07,255
No-one?

499
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:10,800
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

500
01:20:10,883 --> 01:20:13,636
We're all alone in the world.

501
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,848
I have you, you have me.

502
01:20:18,558 --> 01:20:21,060
Only for a little while, I mean.

503
01:20:21,144 --> 01:20:26,399
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

504
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:30,528
We could have all that money
in our hands.

505
01:20:34,615 --> 01:20:41,122
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

506
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:46,002
It's all over for you now.

507
01:20:46,085 --> 01:20:49,964
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

508
01:20:51,382 --> 01:20:53,342
Oh, God, forgive me.

509
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:56,554
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

510
01:21:07,106 --> 01:21:09,692
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

511
01:21:09,775 --> 01:21:13,404
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

512
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:17,742
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

513
01:21:17,825 --> 01:21:21,370
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

514
01:21:21,454 --> 01:21:23,789
I would tell the name on the grave.

515
01:21:23,873 --> 01:21:28,461
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

516
01:21:28,544 --> 01:21:31,756
But you know how many graves
there are there?

517
01:21:31,839 --> 01:21:37,720
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

518
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:44,060
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

519
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:46,729
On... on the grave.

520
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:52,568
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

521
01:21:52,652 --> 01:21:55,655
I'll always honour your memory.

522
01:21:55,738 --> 01:22:00,034
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

523
01:22:01,994 --> 01:22:03,955
Come closer.

524
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:10,920
Tell me.

525
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:14,757
You dirty...

526
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:19,053
I'll sleep better...

527
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:23,599
knowing my good friend is by my side...

528
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:26,060
to protect me.

529
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,154
"Tuco, water. " Well, here's water.

530
01:22:37,238 --> 01:22:41,909
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

531
01:22:47,957 --> 01:22:50,793
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

532
01:22:50,876 --> 01:22:54,672
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

533
01:22:54,755 --> 01:23:00,136
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

534
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:03,264
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

535
01:23:03,347 --> 01:23:08,227
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

536
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,896
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

537
01:23:27,496 --> 01:23:29,790
Hey, Pablo?

538
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:39,091
Don't you recognise me?

539
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:43,137
It's me. Tuco.

540
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,348
Let me embrace you...

541
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:51,562
I don't know the right thing.

542
01:23:55,733 --> 01:24:01,989
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

543
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:06,869
Did I do wrong?

544
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:09,872
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

545
01:24:09,955 --> 01:24:12,208
You have seen me, Tuco.

546
01:24:14,126 --> 01:24:17,087
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

547
01:24:22,676 --> 01:24:24,762
Ah, my uniform.

548
01:24:24,845 --> 01:24:26,931
It's a long story.

549
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:30,434
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

550
01:24:30,518 --> 01:24:35,189
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

551
01:24:36,857 --> 01:24:40,653
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

552
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,615
Wh... What about our parents?

553
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:51,956
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

554
01:24:53,874 --> 01:24:56,752
Nine years?

555
01:24:56,835 --> 01:24:59,547
So it's nine years.

556
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,215
Nine years.

557
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:04,718
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

558
01:25:06,136 --> 01:25:11,684
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

559
01:25:13,227 --> 01:25:15,729
He asked for you to be there.

560
01:25:15,813 --> 01:25:18,941
But there was only me.

561
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:26,991
And you?

562
01:25:27,074 --> 01:25:31,287
Outside of eviI,
what else have you managed to do?

563
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:36,208
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

564
01:25:37,626 --> 01:25:39,545
Not one. Lots of them.

565
01:25:39,628 --> 01:25:43,424
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

566
01:25:43,507 --> 01:25:47,928
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

567
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:51,348
What good would that be?

568
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:54,101
Just keep on the way you're going.

569
01:25:54,184 --> 01:25:56,603
Go away.

570
01:25:56,687 --> 01:25:59,273
- The Lord have mercy on your souI.
- Sure, I'll go.

571
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:02,151
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

572
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:07,531
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

573
01:26:07,614 --> 01:26:10,034
You think you're better than I am.

574
01:26:10,117 --> 01:26:15,039
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

575
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:19,501
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

576
01:26:19,585 --> 01:26:21,879
You talk of our mother and father -

577
01:26:21,962 --> 01:26:24,631
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

578
01:26:24,715 --> 01:26:28,844
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

579
01:26:28,927 --> 01:26:33,057
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

580
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:39,146
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

581
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,248
Tuco.

582
01:27:08,759 --> 01:27:11,011
Please forgive me, brother.

583
01:27:22,272 --> 01:27:24,191
Haa!

584
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,961
Ah, my belly's full.

585
01:27:44,044 --> 01:27:46,296
Nice guy, my brother.

586
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,924
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

587
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:53,387
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

588
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:58,725
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other. "

589
01:27:58,809 --> 01:28:02,729
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too. "

590
01:28:02,813 --> 01:28:06,984
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

591
01:28:08,026 --> 01:28:11,154
My brother, he's crazy about me.

592
01:28:14,658 --> 01:28:19,746
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

593
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:24,918
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowI of soup.

594
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:29,131
Sure.

595
01:28:29,214 --> 01:28:34,011
Well, after a meaI
there's nothing like a good cigar.

596
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:26,980
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

597
01:29:27,064 --> 01:29:30,275
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

598
01:29:30,358 --> 01:29:33,403
That sure is a long way.

599
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:37,616
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

600
01:29:37,699 --> 01:29:39,868
- After that...
- Then what?

601
01:29:41,953 --> 01:29:46,750
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

602
01:29:48,794 --> 01:29:53,173
Those men aren't worried
about anything any more, are they?

603
01:29:55,008 --> 01:30:01,264
But since I'm alive and I've noticed
we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,

604
01:30:01,348 --> 01:30:04,601
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

605
01:30:04,684 --> 01:30:08,772
Towards 200,000 dollars.
Is that good enough for you?

606
01:30:17,614 --> 01:30:19,699
Whoa.

607
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:30,043
Wake up, you.

608
01:30:30,126 --> 01:30:33,588
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

609
01:30:40,011 --> 01:30:43,723
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

610
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:47,686
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

611
01:30:47,769 --> 01:30:51,147
Hurrah! Down with GeneraI Grant!

612
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:53,066
Hurrah for GeneraI...

613
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:54,860
- What's his name?
- Lee.

614
01:30:54,943 --> 01:30:56,444
.. Lee!

615
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:01,908
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

616
01:31:01,992 --> 01:31:05,745
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

617
01:31:18,008 --> 01:31:22,095
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

618
01:31:22,178 --> 01:31:25,890
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

619
01:31:25,974 --> 01:31:29,227
Prisoners of war, forward...

620
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:32,105
march.

621
01:31:32,188 --> 01:31:35,358
Hup, two, three, four...

622
01:32:28,495 --> 01:32:31,164
Left face.

623
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,546
Form a single file. Move.

624
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,799
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

625
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,641
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

626
01:33:31,724 --> 01:33:35,645
- NathanieI Sullivan.

627
01:33:36,104 --> 01:33:39,232
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

628
01:33:39,858 --> 01:33:42,735
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

629
01:33:45,905 --> 01:33:47,991
Bill Carson.

630
01:33:50,702 --> 01:33:53,204
Bill Carson?

631
01:33:53,663 --> 01:33:56,124
I said Bill Carson.

632
01:33:56,207 --> 01:33:59,002
Hey, Blondie, isn't that AngeI Eyes?

633
01:33:59,836 --> 01:34:05,884
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

634
01:34:05,967 --> 01:34:08,845
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

635
01:34:08,928 --> 01:34:10,597
Bill Carson!

636
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,808
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

637
01:34:21,816 --> 01:34:24,027
Please, Carson...

638
01:34:25,069 --> 01:34:27,155
answer "present".

639
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:31,326
What, are you deaf?

640
01:34:36,205 --> 01:34:38,708
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

641
01:34:40,752 --> 01:34:45,840
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

642
01:34:45,923 --> 01:34:49,010
And sometimes they never get up.

643
01:34:49,802 --> 01:34:51,262
Wallace.

644
01:34:52,764 --> 01:34:54,515
That's enough.

645
01:34:57,393 --> 01:34:58,645
Sergeant.

646
01:35:00,772 --> 01:35:04,942
The captain wants to see you right away.

647
01:35:06,694 --> 01:35:10,239
Be sure these two get good treatment.

648
01:35:19,248 --> 01:35:23,211
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

649
01:35:25,505 --> 01:35:27,590
Yeah.

650
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:33,596
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

651
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,600
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

652
01:35:37,683 --> 01:35:40,645
No more brutality.

653
01:35:40,728 --> 01:35:44,440
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

654
01:35:44,524 --> 01:35:46,609
I have to have respect.

655
01:35:46,692 --> 01:35:51,697
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

656
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:55,576
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

657
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,538
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

658
01:35:58,621 --> 01:36:05,294
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

659
01:36:06,003 --> 01:36:07,797
That an accusation?

660
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,094
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

661
01:36:13,594 --> 01:36:17,098
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

662
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:20,351
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

663
01:36:20,434 --> 01:36:23,646
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

664
01:36:23,729 --> 01:36:28,734
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

665
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:32,572
Yes, sir.

666
01:36:32,655 --> 01:36:35,032
Just as long as you're the commandant.

667
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:38,786
Yes, Sergeant.

668
01:36:40,913 --> 01:36:44,667
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

669
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:51,424
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martiaI

670
01:36:51,507 --> 01:36:57,555
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

671
01:37:01,809 --> 01:37:04,520
I wish you luck.

672
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:42,558
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

673
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:46,896
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

674
01:37:56,739 --> 01:38:01,285
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

675
01:38:14,757 --> 01:38:18,844
AngeI Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

676
01:38:18,928 --> 01:38:24,225
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

677
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:26,811
Get in.

678
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:38,072
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashfuI.

679
01:38:39,365 --> 01:38:42,493
There's no formalities here.

680
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,548
It's been a long time.

681
01:38:58,551 --> 01:39:00,761
You're hungry.

682
01:39:00,845 --> 01:39:03,556
Sit down. Eat.

683
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:25,453
I knew it, I knew it!

684
01:39:25,536 --> 01:39:31,667
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, AngeI Eyes. "

685
01:39:32,668 --> 01:39:36,130
"I bet he got himself an easy job. "

686
01:39:38,549 --> 01:39:41,260
"And he never forgets a friend. "

687
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:44,471
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

688
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,474
Right.

689
01:39:47,558 --> 01:39:50,895
It's good to see old friends again.

690
01:39:50,978 --> 01:39:52,521
Good.

691
01:39:52,605 --> 01:39:56,025
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

692
01:39:56,108 --> 01:39:59,653
And have so much to talk about.

693
01:39:59,737 --> 01:40:03,115
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

694
01:40:05,409 --> 01:40:09,205
You were captured near Fort Craig?

695
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:19,882
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

696
01:40:31,268 --> 01:40:36,815
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

697
01:40:36,899 --> 01:40:40,110
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

698
01:40:42,196 --> 01:40:48,035
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

699
01:40:50,746 --> 01:40:53,499
One name is as good as another.

700
01:40:53,582 --> 01:40:56,502
Not wise to use your own name.

701
01:40:56,585 --> 01:41:00,965
Like you.
I bet they don't call you AngeI Eyes.

702
01:41:01,048 --> 01:41:04,009
Sergeant AngeI Eyes!

703
01:41:11,976 --> 01:41:15,062
Like a little music with your meaI, Tuco?

704
01:41:15,145 --> 01:41:21,151
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

705
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:35,207
So...

706
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:39,336
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

707
01:41:43,298 --> 01:41:46,635
That fake, too?

708
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,931
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

709
01:41:51,014 --> 01:41:55,853
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

710
01:41:58,272 --> 01:42:00,149
Aarh!

711
01:43:18,727 --> 01:43:23,148
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

712
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:30,364
What did he tell you about the money?

713
01:43:30,447 --> 01:43:33,075
I don't...

714
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:35,869
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

715
01:43:54,262 --> 01:43:56,181
More feeling.

716
01:44:14,616 --> 01:44:18,286
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your paI.

717
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:21,331
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

718
01:44:21,415 --> 01:44:24,960
So many of us
have had a session in there.

719
01:44:45,564 --> 01:44:48,984
How's your digestion now?

720
01:44:51,695 --> 01:44:57,075
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

721
01:45:23,435 --> 01:45:26,146
Play that fiddle, you.

722
01:46:09,731 --> 01:46:11,942
I'll talk... I'll talk...

723
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:24,204
What did he say about the money?

724
01:46:24,287 --> 01:46:27,749
It's bu...

725
01:46:27,832 --> 01:46:31,336
It's buried in a grave.

726
01:46:31,419 --> 01:46:33,129
Where?

727
01:46:33,213 --> 01:46:34,631
Sad Hill...

728
01:46:34,714 --> 01:46:37,217
Sad Hill cemetery.

729
01:46:39,928 --> 01:46:41,888
Which grave?

730
01:46:41,972 --> 01:46:45,892
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

731
01:46:47,519 --> 01:46:49,479
Blondie...

732
01:46:49,562 --> 01:46:54,359
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

733
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:14,170
The war's over for you.

734
01:47:16,131 --> 01:47:19,259
Put those clothes on.

735
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,222
Why?

736
01:47:24,305 --> 01:47:27,267
We're going for a ride.

737
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:31,354
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

738
01:47:31,438 --> 01:47:34,649
I know the name of the cemetery now.

739
01:47:34,733 --> 01:47:38,236
And you know the name of the grave.

740
01:47:57,297 --> 01:48:00,425
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

741
01:48:03,845 --> 01:48:05,805
Would you talk?

742
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,391
No. Probably not.

743
01:48:10,143 --> 01:48:12,729
That's what I thought.

744
01:48:12,812 --> 01:48:15,190
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

745
01:48:15,273 --> 01:48:18,651
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

746
01:48:22,363 --> 01:48:25,575
And Tuco? Is he...

747
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,747
No. Not yet.

748
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:33,416
But he's in very good hands.

749
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:37,629
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deaI.

750
01:48:37,712 --> 01:48:40,256
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

751
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:45,553
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

752
01:48:50,391 --> 01:48:52,477
Yeah.

753
01:49:11,746 --> 01:49:13,206
Hold it.

754
01:49:13,289 --> 01:49:16,084
That's it. Don't move.

755
01:49:16,167 --> 01:49:21,714
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

756
01:49:21,798 --> 01:49:25,093
Got it. Thank you.

757
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:43,444
Hey, CorporaI, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebeI going?

758
01:49:43,528 --> 01:49:47,156
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

759
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:52,370
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

760
01:49:52,453 --> 01:49:56,207
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

761
01:50:01,337 --> 01:50:03,089
I told you once, friend.

762
01:50:03,172 --> 01:50:08,011
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

763
01:50:27,947 --> 01:50:30,158
You're a lot luckier than that one.

764
01:50:30,241 --> 01:50:32,827
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

765
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:36,789
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

766
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:22,895
If your friends stay out in the damp,
they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?

767
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:25,356
Or a bullet.

768
01:52:29,485 --> 01:52:32,863
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

769
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:49,005
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

770
01:52:49,088 --> 01:52:51,549
One, two,

771
01:52:51,632 --> 01:52:53,676
three, four,

772
01:52:54,176 --> 01:52:56,554
five, six.

773
01:52:57,013 --> 01:53:00,182
Six... Perfect number.

774
01:53:01,475 --> 01:53:04,437
Isn't three the perfect number?

775
01:53:05,563 --> 01:53:10,026
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

776
01:54:12,421 --> 01:54:17,093
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

777
01:54:17,176 --> 01:54:21,889
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

778
01:54:21,972 --> 01:54:24,767
You smell like a pig already.

779
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:27,686
Let's try not to make things any worse.

780
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:32,066
Get going.

781
01:54:40,282 --> 01:54:43,953
I can't while you're watching me.

782
01:54:54,964 --> 01:54:56,924
Aaaarh!

783
01:55:06,392 --> 01:55:10,145
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

784
01:55:30,457 --> 01:55:34,420
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

785
01:57:18,565 --> 01:57:21,401
Squad, halt.

786
01:57:21,485 --> 01:57:24,363
Take your places.

787
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,458
Ready.

788
01:57:36,542 --> 01:57:38,043
Aim.

789
01:57:38,127 --> 01:57:40,212
Fire.

790
01:57:55,936 --> 01:57:59,231
Clem, take care of the horses.

791
02:02:14,736 --> 02:02:18,239
I've been looking for you for eight months.

792
02:02:18,323 --> 02:02:22,911
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

793
02:02:22,994 --> 02:02:26,956
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

794
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:32,879
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

795
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:51,481
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

796
02:02:53,108 --> 02:02:56,194
Every gun makes its own tune.

797
02:02:56,277 --> 02:02:59,739
It's perfect timing, large one.

798
02:03:16,589 --> 02:03:19,134
Clem, follow him.

799
02:04:16,191 --> 02:04:19,194
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

800
02:04:19,277 --> 02:04:23,031
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

801
02:04:43,259 --> 02:04:46,804
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

802
02:04:55,146 --> 02:04:56,940
Hey...

803
02:04:57,023 --> 02:05:01,694
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

804
02:05:03,196 --> 02:05:07,617
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend AngeI Eyes.

805
02:05:08,117 --> 02:05:11,537
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

806
02:05:12,163 --> 02:05:16,918
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

807
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:20,838
You... me...

808
02:05:20,964 --> 02:05:23,800
So only you know your half of the secret?

809
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:26,094
Mm-hm.

810
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:30,848
Ah, Blondie...

811
02:05:30,932 --> 02:05:35,311
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

812
02:05:35,395 --> 02:05:38,982
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

813
02:05:39,065 --> 02:05:43,111
I forgot to mention.

814
02:05:43,194 --> 02:05:47,949
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

815
02:05:48,032 --> 02:05:51,411
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

816
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:57,458
So that's why you came to Tuco.

817
02:05:59,544 --> 02:06:02,255
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

818
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:17,103
They shot him at close range.

819
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:40,543
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

820
02:06:42,545 --> 02:06:46,132
They'll come looking for us.

821
02:06:46,215 --> 02:06:48,426
Watch out.

822
02:06:48,509 --> 02:06:51,554
There's two of them.

823
02:06:51,637 --> 02:06:53,890
I want that blond alive.

824
02:07:02,732 --> 02:07:06,444
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

825
02:07:40,102 --> 02:07:42,438
Were you going to die alone?

826
02:09:32,798 --> 02:09:34,091
Ho!

827
02:09:59,158 --> 02:10:02,244
Hey, Blondie. AngeI Eyes is mine.

828
02:10:02,328 --> 02:10:03,913
All right.

829
02:10:43,244 --> 02:10:48,040
"See you soon, i... idi.. "

830
02:10:48,123 --> 02:10:50,709
"Idiots. "

831
02:10:50,793 --> 02:10:53,087
It's for you.

832
02:11:17,319 --> 02:11:20,281
How peacefuI and quiet, amigo.

833
02:11:20,364 --> 02:11:24,034
Like a cemetery, for instance?

834
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:27,037
There should be a bridge
across that river.

835
02:11:27,121 --> 02:11:32,751
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

836
02:11:32,835 --> 02:11:35,587
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

837
02:11:35,671 --> 02:11:39,717
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

838
02:11:44,763 --> 02:11:47,850
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

839
02:11:47,933 --> 02:11:51,270
Come along, now. Follow me.

840
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:40,486
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

841
02:12:53,957 --> 02:12:56,168
Where do you haiI from?

842
02:12:56,251 --> 02:12:57,669
Illinois.

843
02:13:00,088 --> 02:13:01,965
And you?

844
02:13:02,049 --> 02:13:03,926
I'm with him.

845
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:13,268
Any reason for being around here?

846
02:13:13,352 --> 02:13:16,313
We want to enlist, GeneraI.

847
02:13:18,857 --> 02:13:21,193
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

848
02:13:21,276 --> 02:13:23,362
I'm a captain.

849
02:13:24,696 --> 02:13:27,491
Get the hell out.

850
02:13:27,574 --> 02:13:30,577
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

851
02:13:30,661 --> 02:13:32,746
Yes, sir.

852
02:13:37,543 --> 02:13:39,795
So you want to enlist?

853
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:44,466
You've got to take a test to prove it.

854
02:13:52,432 --> 02:13:54,935
Well, show me.

855
02:14:12,869 --> 02:14:15,956
Hey...

856
02:14:17,708 --> 02:14:22,129
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make coloneI.

857
02:14:22,212 --> 02:14:25,007
- Really?
- Sure.

858
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:27,217
Like it says in the manuaI,

859
02:14:27,301 --> 02:14:32,681
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

860
02:14:32,764 --> 02:14:37,894
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war.

861
02:14:39,646 --> 02:14:43,275
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

862
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:46,486
Volunteers.

863
02:14:47,946 --> 02:14:52,409
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

864
02:14:52,492 --> 02:14:55,620
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

865
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:00,542
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

866
02:15:09,009 --> 02:15:10,552
Eh?

867
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,144
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

868
02:15:19,227 --> 02:15:23,273
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

869
02:15:23,356 --> 02:15:29,780
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

870
02:15:29,863 --> 02:15:32,240
All of us reek of alcohoI.

871
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:42,709
What did you say your name was?

872
02:15:42,793 --> 02:15:44,127
Uh...

873
02:15:44,961 --> 02:15:47,089
And you?

874
02:15:47,881 --> 02:15:48,965
Uh...

875
02:15:49,049 --> 02:15:51,051
"Uh. " No.

876
02:15:56,056 --> 02:15:58,767
Names don't matter.

877
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:04,439
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

878
02:16:04,523 --> 02:16:06,817
We have two attacks a day.

879
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:09,569
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

880
02:16:09,653 --> 02:16:14,825
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

881
02:16:14,908 --> 02:16:18,036
Stupid, useless bridge.

882
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:21,373
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

883
02:16:22,415 --> 02:16:27,921
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

884
02:16:28,964 --> 02:16:31,132
Even if all of us are killed.

885
02:16:31,216 --> 02:16:36,805
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

886
02:16:36,888 --> 02:16:41,601
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

887
02:16:41,685 --> 02:16:46,940
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

888
02:16:48,775 --> 02:16:53,113
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

889
02:16:53,196 --> 02:16:57,576
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

890
02:16:57,659 --> 02:17:02,872
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

891
02:17:02,956 --> 02:17:06,251
I've done a lot worse.

892
02:17:09,421 --> 02:17:13,925
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

893
02:17:14,009 --> 02:17:17,220
In here, I've destroyed it all.

894
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:23,393
It's a court-martiaI offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

895
02:17:23,476 --> 02:17:29,107
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

896
02:17:30,567 --> 02:17:32,819
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

897
02:17:34,487 --> 02:17:37,866
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

898
02:17:41,286 --> 02:17:44,414
I've been dreaming about it.

899
02:17:46,916 --> 02:17:50,378
I've even worked out a plan.

900
02:17:50,462 --> 02:17:52,464
I sure have.

901
02:17:53,381 --> 02:17:56,676
The best time is after the attack,

902
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:00,638
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

903
02:18:00,722 --> 02:18:05,727
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

904
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:13,818
But what I lack is the guts.

905
02:18:19,032 --> 02:18:22,285
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

906
02:18:22,369 --> 02:18:25,747
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

907
02:18:25,830 --> 02:18:28,541
Be right there.

908
02:18:41,054 --> 02:18:43,181
Let's go.

909
02:18:43,264 --> 02:18:45,183
All right, friends.

910
02:18:45,266 --> 02:18:48,520
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

911
02:19:18,842 --> 02:19:21,344
Companies, report.

912
02:19:21,427 --> 02:19:24,222
Company B ready.

913
02:19:24,305 --> 02:19:27,100
Company E ready.

914
02:19:27,183 --> 02:19:30,311
Company D ready.

915
02:19:35,191 --> 02:19:38,945
Companies, forward!

916
02:19:59,883 --> 02:20:03,845
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

917
02:20:03,928 --> 02:20:06,014
Yeah.

918
02:20:58,274 --> 02:21:02,653
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

919
02:21:22,256 --> 02:21:26,636
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

920
02:21:29,931 --> 02:21:32,141
Blondie...

921
02:21:32,225 --> 02:21:34,852
The money's on the other side of the river.

922
02:21:34,936 --> 02:21:37,855
Oh? Where?

923
02:21:40,191 --> 02:21:44,112
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

924
02:21:44,195 --> 02:21:48,741
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

925
02:21:48,825 --> 02:21:53,955
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

926
02:21:54,038 --> 02:22:00,044
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

927
02:22:00,128 --> 02:22:02,213
Maybe.

928
02:22:39,375 --> 02:22:43,379
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

929
02:22:44,672 --> 02:22:47,550
Hurry, a stretcher.

930
02:22:48,634 --> 02:22:51,470
Easy. Easy now.

931
02:22:55,349 --> 02:22:56,767
Arh!

932
02:23:01,397 --> 02:23:04,108
Get things ready.

933
02:23:23,961 --> 02:23:26,797
A little of this will help.

934
02:23:32,386 --> 02:23:34,847
Take a slug of this, Captain.

935
02:23:34,930 --> 02:23:36,932
And keep your ears open.

936
02:24:25,606 --> 02:24:29,443
What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

937
02:26:07,833 --> 02:26:11,921
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

938
02:26:12,463 --> 02:26:18,218
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautifuI money.

939
02:26:18,302 --> 02:26:20,137
Yeah, Tuco.

940
02:26:21,055 --> 02:26:23,390
Sure would be a pity.

941
02:26:53,295 --> 02:26:54,463
Doc...

942
02:26:56,715 --> 02:27:01,512
Doctor... Can you help me
live a little longer?

943
02:27:01,595 --> 02:27:04,556
I expect good news.

944
02:27:50,436 --> 02:27:53,188
Eh... Eh...

945
02:27:54,565 --> 02:27:57,693
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

946
02:27:57,776 --> 02:28:00,279
Why don't we?

947
02:28:01,321 --> 02:28:03,365
You go first.

948
02:28:05,117 --> 02:28:09,955
No, I think it's better that...

949
02:28:10,038 --> 02:28:12,416
you start.

950
02:28:15,586 --> 02:28:18,297
All right.

951
02:28:19,131 --> 02:28:23,719
The name of the cemetery is...

952
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:41,820
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

953
02:28:50,078 --> 02:28:52,873
The name on the grave is...

954
02:28:56,335 --> 02:28:58,378
Arch Stanton.

955
02:28:58,462 --> 02:29:01,965
Ar... Arch Stanton?

956
02:29:02,049 --> 02:29:04,301
Are you sure?

957
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:06,553
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

958
02:40:54,844 --> 02:40:58,430
It'll be a lot easier with that.

959
02:41:37,511 --> 02:41:39,680
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

960
02:41:40,306 --> 02:41:42,391
Dig.

961
02:41:44,393 --> 02:41:46,103
You're not digging.

962
02:41:58,574 --> 02:42:02,953
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

963
02:42:03,829 --> 02:42:05,164
Why?

964
02:42:08,083 --> 02:42:10,711
I'll tell you why.

965
02:42:10,794 --> 02:42:13,297
Cos there's nothing in there.

966
02:42:21,388 --> 02:42:24,641
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

967
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:31,648
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

968
02:42:31,732 --> 02:42:34,860
We're gonna have to earn it.

969
02:42:37,446 --> 02:42:39,740
How?

970
02:42:49,708 --> 02:42:52,544
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

971
02:42:56,340 --> 02:42:58,467
The gun?

972
02:49:04,332 --> 02:49:08,503
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

973
02:49:10,505 --> 02:49:12,715
Last night.

974
02:49:12,799 --> 02:49:17,512
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

975
02:49:17,595 --> 02:49:22,267
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

976
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:24,310
You dig.

977
02:49:24,394 --> 02:49:26,521
Where?

978
02:49:36,322 --> 02:49:38,700
Here.

979
02:49:39,617 --> 02:49:41,494
Unk... Un...

980
02:49:41,578 --> 02:49:44,497
There's no name on it.

981
02:49:44,581 --> 02:49:47,292
And there's no name here, either.

982
02:49:48,585 --> 02:49:51,588
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

983
02:49:51,671 --> 02:49:56,467
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

984
02:50:03,266 --> 02:50:05,768
Go ahead.

985
02:51:02,533 --> 02:51:06,287
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

986
02:51:22,261 --> 02:51:27,433
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

987
02:51:27,517 --> 02:51:30,853
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

988
02:51:30,937 --> 02:51:34,315
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

989
02:52:41,466 --> 02:52:45,511
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

990
02:52:50,099 --> 02:52:52,810
Four for you.

991
02:52:54,020 --> 02:52:57,148
And four...

992
02:52:58,316 --> 02:53:00,818
Four for me.

993
02:53:26,844 --> 02:53:28,262
Hey, Blon...

994
02:53:28,346 --> 02:53:29,680
Blon...

995
02:53:38,814 --> 02:53:41,192
Hey, Blondie...

996
02:53:42,443 --> 02:53:45,154
Sorry, Tuco.

997
02:53:48,157 --> 02:53:49,533
Blondie...

998
02:53:58,668 --> 02:54:01,003
Blondie!

999
02:54:08,844 --> 02:54:11,013
Blondie!

1000
02:54:20,773 --> 02:54:21,857
Blondie...

1001
02:54:32,493 --> 02:54:34,370
Blondie...

1002
02:54:49,552 --> 02:54:52,221
Blondie!

1003
02:55:13,409 --> 02:55:16,287
You son of a bitch...

1004
02:55:18,622 --> 02:55:21,083
Blondie...

1005
02:55:41,937 --> 02:55:44,315
Aaaarhh!

1006
02:56:20,226 --> 02:56:23,395
Hey, Blondie!

1007
02:56:24,271 --> 02:56:27,566
You know what you are?

1008
02:56:30,778 --> 02:56:32,655
Just a dirty son of a...
