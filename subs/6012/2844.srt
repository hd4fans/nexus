"where life had no value, death,sometimes, had its price.

11
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,710
这里去图冠卡里远吗?
Is it far to tucumcari?

12
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,870
三、四分钟后就经过那里
we should pass there in about three or four minutes.

13
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,280
谢谢
thanks.

14
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,680
对不起 但牧师你弄错了
excuse me, but you've made a mistake, reverend.

15
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,240
我无意听到你说要去图冠卡里
I couldn't help hearing you're going to tucumcari.

16
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,490
我在那里卖货的 我可以告诉你 你上错车了
I peddle goods around here, and I better tell you you're on the wrong train.

17
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,590
最近图冠卡里的是阿马里路站
I think the nearest stop to tucumcari is amarillo.

18
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,930
在圣菲下车 沿阿马里路回去...
by getting off at sante fe and returning by way of amarillo...

19
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,770
就可以去到你的目的地
you should be able to get right where you're going.

20
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,340
这火车不在图冠卡里停站的
you see, the train doesn't stop at tucumcari.

21
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,020
它会在那里停站
this train'll stop at tucumcari.

22
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,550
大家都别紧张!
take it easy, everybody!.

23
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,880
你为何停下来? 有问题吗?
why'd you stop? something gone wrong?

24
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,150
有人拉了紧急掣
somebody pulled the emergency cord.

25
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,860
你不可以随意拉紧急掣下车的
hey, mister, you just can't pull the emergency cord and jump off.

26
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,000
你为何弄停火车? 若你想下车 就...
why'd you stop that train? If you want to get off, you...

27
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,540
如果有乘客想下车 铁路公司...
well, the railroad company'd be mighty pleased to make any arrangements...

28
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,740
会乐意安排的
for any passenger if you want to get off here, sir.

29
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,510
我已经下车了 谢谢
I did get off. thanks.

30
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,320
好 开车吧 走
all right, let's go!. go ahead!

31
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,220
(通缉: 谋杀犯高佳尔)

32
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,020
(赏金: 十万元)

33
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,690
高佳尔亲自在上面 加了两个"零"字
guy passed by here in person and added on those two zeros.

34
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,490
他看见这么少的赏金 非常不高兴
he was spittin' mad when he saw what they was offerin'. he wasn't flattered.

35
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,730
他说: 只悬赏一千元抓我 太少了
he said, "a measly thousand bucks for me is much too little.

36
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,640
我值更多钱
I'm worth a lot more than that."

37
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,700
然后他就自己加多两个"零"
he said that, and then he added the zeros on the thousand.

38
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,110
没有人胆敢面对这个杀人犯吧?
there isn't anyone got the guts to face that killer, eh?

39
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,590
起码...
at least...

40
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,420
至今还是这样
it's been that way till now.

41
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,530
他在哪?
where is he?

42
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,980
他在哪?
where is he?

43
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,800
我不知道他今天在哪
I have no idea where he'd be today.

44
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,490
- 别动 - 但是 高佳尔...
- hold still. - but guy...

45
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,460
- 我说别动 - 别伤害我
- hold still, I said. - you hurt me with those hands of yours.

46
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,290
- 照我的话做 - 别这样!
- then do as I tell ya. - stop it!

47
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,230
看 你令我丢了肥皂
now see, you've made me drop the soap.

48
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,230
- 慢着 我拿给你 - 你气死我了
- wait, I'll get it for ya. - you're killing me.

49
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,210
看 那是什么?
oh, look. what's that?

50
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,110
对不起 小姐
pardon me, ma'am.

51
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,640
我宰了你
I'll kill you for this.

52
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,020
你的赏金 1000美元
there you are. a thousand dollars.

53
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,250
(通缉: 卡比比红仔) (赏金二千元)

54
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,700
卡的事 你知道多少?
what do you know about Cavanagh?

55
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,840
约一个星期前 他在白石镇出现过
about a week ago he was seen at white rocks.

56
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,070
谢谢
thanks.

57
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,840
若你有兴趣...
If it's of any interest to ya...

58
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,510
有人来这里问过他的事
somebody else dropped in to see me about him.

59
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,780
谁?
who?

60
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,620
我没有见过他
I'd never seen him before.

61
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,180
他名叫蒙哥
his name is monco.

62
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,970
(白石镇)

63
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,080
有火吗?
Iight?

64
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,680
你认识卡比比吗?

65
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,480
告诉我 哪里可以找到他?
now tell me, you know where I can find him?

66
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,520
在那一张桌子
there, at that table.

67
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,530
他背向着你
he's got his back to ya.

68
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,170
谢谢
thanks.

69
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,440
换两张牌
two cards.

70
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,440
赌注是什么?
didn't hear what the bet was.

71
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,140
赌你的生命
your life.

72
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,220
生或死 你来决定
alive or dead... it's your choice.

73
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,660
放了红仔
Iet red go.

74
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,530
二千元不是个小数目
two thousand dollars. It's a lot of money.

75
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,860
我要三年才赚得到
takes me three years to earn it.

76
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,160
做警长的 不是应该勇敢、忠心...
tell me, isn't a sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal...

77
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,170
还必须老实吗?
and above all, honest?

78
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,400
对 他是这样
yeah, that he is.

79
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,250
我想你们需要换警长
I think you people need a new sheriff.

80
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,860
修伊
Hughie.

81
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,810
尼尔 你好吗?
how are you, Nino?

82
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,810
我见到你就更好了

83
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,930
走吧
go on. go ahead.

84
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,380
打开闸门

85
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,860
- 什么事? 是谁? - 是罗特 先生

87
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,750
我让你活着 英雄
I'm letting you live, hero.

88
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,020
让你告诉所有人你看见些什么
that's so you can tell everybody you've seen what takes place here.

89
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,680
(悬红一万元)

90
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,530
(缉拿印迪奥)

91
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,170
(不管生或死)

92
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,710
就为了那些钱
for the lousy money.

93
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,390
你拿了赏金 让我坐牢
you took money to put me behind bars.

94
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,360
你早该趁机杀了我
you should've killed me when you could.

95
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,130
对你会有好处的
It would be better for you.

96
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,460
对他们也是
and for them.

97
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,900
孩子多大了?
how old's the boy?

98
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,040
我问孩子多大了?
how old is the boy, I asked?

99
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,680
他十八个月大
he's 18 months now.

100
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,990
刚好我坐牢那么久
just the time that I was in jail.

101
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,960
你拿了那笔赏金...
you used the reward that you got...

102
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,460
成家立室
to start raising a family.

103
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,360
所以我觉得你的家我也有一份
and that's why I feel your family is partly mine.

104
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,470
现在我要取回我那一份
I'll take my part now.

105
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,470
出去
outside.

106
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,940
他们都是无辜的 求你放了他们! 都是我不好
they're both innocent. please let them go! I was the one. you know that.

107
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,770
我知道 我也知道你恨透了我
I know. I'm sure you hate me just enough.

108
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,630
这回你有机会射我了
this time you'll have a chance to shoot me, but not in the back.

109
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,600
放开他
Iet go.

110
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,310
音乐停了就开始
when you hear the music finish, begin.

111
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,960
你猜你行吗?
or do you think you can?

112
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,520
开始吧
Iet's start.

113
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,170

- Carolina. - that's right, Carolina.

119
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,060
可以为你效劳吗?

120
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,090
- 我要找一家一流的银行 - 这就是了
- I'm looking for a first-class bank. - oh, but exactly.

121
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,640
是吧

122
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,100
境内最大最安全的银行
the largest and most secure bank in the territory.

123
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,970
莫先生 我可以向你保证 我们银行...
well, mr. Mortimer, I want to assure you our bank here...

124
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,710
齐备所有保安设施
has everything... all the safeguards you're looking for.

125
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,040
我相信你 但我的存款数目很大
I don't doubt that, but I have a large sum to deposit.

126
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,240
假设我是个劫匪
now, suppose I'm a bandit.

127
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,020
劫匪?
a bandit?

128
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,080
带着一班杀手的危险人物
a very dangerous bandit with a gang of killers.

129
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,860
我最可能想打劫哪一家银行?
what would be the most impossible bank for me to rob?

130
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,590
你这情况来说 我说只会打劫埃尔帕索银行
In your case, the one bank I would suggest is the bank of el paso.

131
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,790
连印迪奥也不敢打劫他们
not even lndio would dare to attack that one.

132
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,460
它不只是银行 是个要塞
It's not a bank. It's a fortress there.

133
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,910
下一班往埃尔帕索的火车 几点开?
what time's the next train for el paso?

134
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,410
十一点半 我发电报通知埃尔帕索...
11:30. I'll telegraph to my colleague...

135
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,780
的同事 说你会去那里
in the bank of el paso that you're going to arrive.

136
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,820
谢谢

137
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,930

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,670
先生 长官 上将 欢迎
hey, mister. captain. general. welcome.

139
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,080
要找马厩或房间吗? 要洗个澡吗?
do you need a stable or a room? do you want to take a bath?

140
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,920
我是弗兰 马厩在这里
my name is fernando. the stable is right here.

141
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,780
那是你的酒店
and that is your hotel.

142
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,450
为何指定这一家酒店?
why this hotel and not some other?

143
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,190
你不会喜欢另外那一间
you probably wouldn't like that other place as much, senor.

144
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,490
那里蟑螂到处跑的
you'd have to spend half the night shootin' cockroaches.

145
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,970
这里价钱便宜得多
at this hotel, the rooms will cost you so much less.

146
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,030
还有一个女主人
and there's a landlady at this one, senor.

147
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,970
- 结了婚的吗? - 是的 但她不在乎
- married? - yes, but she doesn't care.

148
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,260
那是银行 我一赚到钱就放进去
that's the bank. as soon as I get some money, I'll put it in.

149
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,630
你得先赚点钱
well, you're gonna have to earn it first.

150
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,000
我可以给你五角钱 只要你...
I have 50 cents here for you if you'll let me know...

151
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,560
一见到陌生人来 你就通知我
when anybody you've never seen before here in el paso comes to town.

152
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,840
酒店那边刚有陌生人出来
at the hotel, senor. a stranger just came outta there.

153
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,950
他住在哪?
where's he staying?

154
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,930
那一间酒店
the hotel.

155
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,300
见到别的陌生人就告诉我
Iet me know if you see any more strangers.

156
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,600
好的
sure, senor.

157
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,120
- 有何贵干? - 我要这上面的房间
- help you, sir? - I want the room right above.

158
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,520
抱歉 出租了 没办法
I'm sorry, it's occupied. It's too bad.

159
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,460
酒店已经爆满 很抱歉
the hotel's filled to capacity. I'm sorry.

160
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,560
你想要我们最好的房子 但它经常住了人
the room you want is our best. It's always occupied.

161
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,830
谁住在那里?
by who?

162
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,600
看登记册吧
check the register.

163
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,260
玛莉!
mary!

164
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,170
是马先生
It's senor martinez.

165
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,020
- 它现在无人住 - 有人住的!
- It's free now. - that room is taken!

166
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,290
我去看看
I'll see to it.

167
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,730
他只是个可恶的野蛮鬼!
he's nothing but a wild, vicious animal!

168
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,740
还很高呢 不是吗?
he's tall, isn't he?

169
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,770
你真淫荡!
you're just dirty!

170
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,820
老板 快 结帐!
proprietor, quick! my bill!

171
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,820
给我算帐!
I want my bill!

172
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,120
- 结帐 - 你不用迁出
- before he comes down, give me my bill. - there's no need to check out.

173
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,400
没事的 我给你换房
everything's gonna be all right. I'll give you another room immediately.

174
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,730
最好的房间 新婚套房吧
It's the best in the whole hotel. we'll let him have the bridal suite.

175
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,170
结帐! 我想留下 但不行
no, mary, the bill. I'd like to stay, only I can't.

176
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,970
- 别走! - 我要应约...
- don't go, mr. martinez. - I have an appointment elsewhere.

177
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,760
老马!
martinez

178
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,410
先生 你想怎样?
yes, senor, what do you want?

179
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,290
我不穿的
I don't wear 'em.

180
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,520
你想起我 真是我的荣幸 谢谢
I'm honored that you thought of me. thank you.

181
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,890
看着这个
watch this.

182
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,660
你们好
hello, my friends.

183
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,730
你好 印迪奥
hello, lndio.

184
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,770
我真的马上就赶来
you see, I didn't waste a minute coming here.

185
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,730
老印一找我 我必马上来
Indio calls and groggy comes running right away.

186
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,290
山佐呢?
and Sancho?

187
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,210
若你要等山佐 我四年后再回来
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go and come back in about four years.

188
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,640
他入狱了 坐四年监
he's in prison for four years.

189
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,470
无女人、无钱、无阳光
no women, no dollars, no sun.

190
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,850
他真可怜 但我们都还好
bad for him. not so bad for the rest of us.

191
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,890
被抓了的人不值得人尊重?
a man who gets caught doesn't deserve respect, huh?

192
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,560
怎么回事?
what's it all about, huh?

193
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,190
你听着
now just listen.

194
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,160
埃尔帕索的银行
a bank at el paso.

195
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
想一想吧
Iet's see.

196
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,540
当这里是银行里面 尼尔就是保险箱
we'll say this is the inside of the bank. Nino is the safe.

197
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,610
它重三吨 不能用炸药打开
which weighs three tons and can't be opened with dynamite.

198
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,190
那边有两个出纳员
there's the part with two cashiers.

199
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,120
那是经理的桌子
this is the manager's desk.

200
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,990
后面是一个装着酒瓶的 漂亮柜子...
right in back is a fancy cabinet containing bottles...

201
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,650
可以招待一些富有存户
for offering drinks to the rich depositors.

202
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,660
那边是大门 他们在对面建了双层墙壁
there's the main door, and opposite they built a double wall.

203
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,700
那会怎么样 高基?
what happens, groggy?

204
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,760
假设你已经 把出纳员和经理干掉
Iet's say you've already killed the two cashiers and the manager.

205
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,780
接着数分钟内 你控制了银行
for the next few minutes, you're the boss of the bank.

206
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,780
怎么样?
now what?

207
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,110
时间浪费了
the time's been wasted.

208
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,420
对 浪费了 尤其是如果要...
right, a waste of time. especially, groggy, to blast open...

209
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,220
炸开保险箱 要用许多炸药...
that damn iron safe, we'd have to be using so much dynamite...

210
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,230
整间银行也会给夷平
that the whole bank would just disappear.

211
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,290
你们也一并炸死
and you'd all go up with it.

212
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,100
况且 有保险箱也不等于...
besides, the presence of a safe alone doesn't always signify...

213
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,000
里面一定有钱
that there is money inside.

214
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,610
为使你更加明白...
to help you understand what I mean...

215
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,380
我想讲一个故事
I would like to relate a nice little parable.

216
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,080
从前有一个木匠
once upon a time there was a carpenter.

217
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,550
你以为木匠赚不到钱吧?
you don't think a carpenter can make money, eh?

218
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,060
是吗? 你错了
no? you're wrong.

219
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,930
这个人风生水起 因为他是造保险箱的
this one did well because he was a builder of safes.

220
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,330
以前有个银行家...
there was a banker once...

221
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,030
决定要掩饰他的铁装保险箱...
who decided he must have his iron safe disguised...

222
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,640
使它看似木柜
to look like a wood cabinet.

223
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,750
为了造好它...
to get it made...

224
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,410
他找那个木匠 但一天...
the banker goes to our carpenter for the job, and one day...

225
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,650
在天意的安排下...
as destiny has it...

226
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,280
木匠去到埃尔帕索
the carpenter's in el paso.

227
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,560
他碰巧走进银行 他发现到什么?
he happens to walk into the bank there, and what does he find?

228
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
那个柜子
the cabinet.

229
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,890
因为木柜是他造的 他马上就认出它
since he'd worked on the cabinet, he spotted it right away.

230
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,570
那天开始 他不能再工作了
from that day on, he couldn't work anymore.

231
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,670
很可惜 因为...
pity, because...

232
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,580
他还有别的事要做
there was something he had to do.

233
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,440
他有个奇想
there was this crazy idea.

234
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,450
一直在他脑海...
and it stayed...

235
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,620
不磨不灭...
and it stayed...

236
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,320
他想插手里面的钱
to put his hands on the money inside.

237
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,330
走进银行去抢掉那些钱
get in there and grab all the money.

238
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,960
你定以为那个木匠 一定很幸运...
sure, you think that carpenter was lucky the way things work out...

239
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,430
一切顺利 走进银行去
that he was lucky to go in just that bank.

240
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,440
但事实不如此
It wasn't true.

241
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,670
他的好运从那天开始到头了
his good fortune stopped that day.

242
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,110
因为后来...
because later...

243
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,110
他坐监的时候...
as a prisoner...

244
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,780
碰上了我
he ran into me.

245
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,210
木匠把故事告诉我 我告诉了你们
the carpenter told me the story, and I tell you.

246
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,960
钱不在保险箱内 在这里!
the money isn't in the safe. It's right in this!

247
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,130
约一百万
almost a million dollars in it.

248
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,500
你在图冠卡里的同事告诉我 这银行...
your colleague in tucumcari told me that this bank...

249
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,380
的存款量是本州之冠
has the largest deposits in the whole state.

250
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,750
的存款量是本州之冠
has the largest deposits in the whole state.

251
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,940
对 莫先生
yes, that's correct, mr. Mortimer.

252
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,220
我们手上有五十万的储备
here at the bank at el paso we have half a million dollars in reserve on hand.

253
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,090
知道了 你肯定这银行够安全吗?
I see. you sure this bank is secure enough to hold that much?

254
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,000
你一把钱存进这家银行...
from the moment your money's on deposit here...

255
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,000
就可以安枕无忧
you can sleep without any worries.

256
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,500
况且...
besides...

257
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,300
银行关门之后 有持械守卫驻守的...
when the bank is closed, an armed guard always remains here...

258
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,000
外面还有巡逻队当值
and a patrol is on guard outside.

259
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,070
连三藩市银行 保安也没那么严密
even the bank of san francisco isn't that well protected.

260
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,810
对 其实...
exactly. the truth is...

261
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,150
想打劫我们 真是妙想天开...
to try robbing us would be so futile...

262
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,620
大笨蛋才会这样想
that only a complete fool would attempt it.

263
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,790
对
yeah.

264
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,920
或者疯汉子吧
or a complete madman.

265
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,800
滚开 别挡路!
get out of the way! get out of here!

266
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,690
新消息
more news, amigo.

267
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,690
又有陌生人吗?
another stranger in town?

268
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,390
对 我还知道别的事
yes. and I know something else.

269
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,700
我没告诉你还有另一个陌生人
there was another stranger I didn't tell you about.

270
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,740
听着 你这臭小子!
Iisten to me, you sawed-off little runt!

271
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,300
我要知道共有多少人
I want to know how many men there are all together.

272
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,750
本来有两个 现在多了两个
well, there were two. now there's two more.

273
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,220
在哪里?
where?

274
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,650
在酒吧
In the saloon.

275
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,550
威士忌
whiskey.

276
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,820
先生 你干嘛来我这里找死?
Iisten, mister, why do you choose my place to commit suicide?

277
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,290
我认识那个人 你活过来真是奇迹
I know that man. It's a miracle you're alive.

278
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,990
怎么拿着枪的人 也愿意受侮辱?
why should a man walk around with a pistol and let himself be insulted?

279
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,000
真是非常奇怪
It's mighty strange.

280
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,030
若那驼子不杀你...
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

281
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,590
他一定有非常重要的理由
he had a very important reason, that's all.

282
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,240
我也这么想
I was thinking that myself.

283
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,480
一、二...

286
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,780
十一、十二、十三...

287
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,310
十四、十五、十六...
14, 15, 16...

288
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,790
十七、十八、十九...
17, 18, 19...

289
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,060
二十、二十一、二十二...

00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,550
三十二、三十三...
32 and 33.

295
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,430
(马氏兄弟被杀手夺命)

296
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,200
不要 不
no, no.

297
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,050
好了 起来
all right, now.

298
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,290
我不认识他!
I don't know him!

299
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,290
不要这样 你认识他
come on, now, you know everybody.

300
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,160
我谁也不认识 我死了! 明白吗?
I don't know anybody anymore! I'm dead! understand?

301
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,700
我以前曾经谁都认识
well, there was a time when I knew everybody.

302
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,600
很久以前了 这里本来还未开发
that was a long time ago when all this was prairie.

303
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,070
现在人人都那么匆忙...
In these days everybody's in a hurry. that's right...

304
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,730
还有那些一无是处的火车!
with your damned good-for-nothing trains!

305
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,600
真呕心!
disgusting!

306
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,010
一天 铁路公司有人来找我
one day, someone from the railroad comes here to see me.

307
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,750
他说 "先知 铁路将会路经你这房子"
he says, "prophet, the railway's gonna go right past your house."

308
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,760
我说: "是吗? "
"ls that so?" I said.

309
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,190
他说: "对了"
"yep, that right," he says.

310
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,490
"所有火车都会路经这里"
"all those trains gonna go right past here.

311
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,890
"最好把你的地卖给铁路公司吧"
the best thing for you, prophet, is sell your land to the company...

312
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,690
"否则我们就买姓贝的"
or else we'll buy baker's.

313
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,530
"他住在隔壁 我把路轨装在这里"
he lives next to your place, and I'll put the tracks here...

314
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,700
"一定吵得你发疯"
and that'll make you go crazy.

315
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,970
"你愿意卖地给我们? "
will you sell out to our company, prophet?"

316
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,510
我说: "是吗? "
"oh, is that so?" says l.

317
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,780
他很焦急 想我卖地
he was very anxious for me to sell out.

318
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,110
你猜我怎对他说?
you know what I told him about the railroad?

319
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,050
你猜我对他筑铁路有何建议?
you know what I told him he could do with his railroad?

320
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,800
你猜我决定如何?
you know what my decision about selling was?

321
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,810
你拒绝他
well, you said no.

322
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,280
对了 拒绝他 和他那些鬼火车!
you're right about that. no to him and his damn trains!

323
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,280
怎么也不卖!
I wouldn't! no!

324
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,280
听着 老伯
Iook, listen to me, old man.

325
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,280
你应该是一个先知
you're supposed to be a prophet.

326
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,190
我不要听你谈什么火车
I didn't come here to listen to you rattle on about trains.

327
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,660
我想知道这个人的事 但你什么都不知道
I want to find out about this man. It's obvious you don't know anything.

328
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,490
别批评我 若你只为此而来...
no need to be insulting. If that's all you came here to do...

329
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,530
趁我还没发脾气 你马上走
you can clear out of my house fast before I lose my temper.

330
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,530
明白吗?
understand?

331
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,500
你去哪?
hey! where you goin'?

332
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,310
还是趁你没有发脾气 我先走了
I guess I better leave before you go and lose your temper.

333
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,710
你怎么了? 你干嘛那么笨?
what's the matter with you? why are you so dang stupid?

334
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,720
快拿枪给我
hurry up, give me that pistol there.

335
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,220
就在你后面
yeah, right there behind ya.

336
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,220
快!
hurry!

337
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,690
就是那个 拿过来
yes, that's the one. now, hand it over.

338
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,420
对了 把枪给我 你问及的人
that's it. give me that gun. the man you asked about.

339
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,490
只有一个问题: 他怎带枪的?
there's only one question: how does he carry his gun?

340
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,760
戴在这里 在肚子前面?
he wears it here, across his belly?

341
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,290
你怎不一早告诉我?
well, why didn't you tell me that in the first place, my boy.

342
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,840
我认识你想查的那个人
of course I know the man you're trying to find out about.

343
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,840
我当然认识他
of course I know him.

344
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,090
他是莫蒂默上校
he's colonel Douglas Mortimer.

345
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,060
莫蒂默 好英勇的军人
Mortimer... a brave man, a soldier.

346
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,390
他是卡罗来纳的神枪手
he was known as the best shot in the Carolinas.

347
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,100
很好的军人
a great soldier.

348
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,070
他已经像你一样 是赚赏金的杀手
now he's reduced to being a bounty killer, same as you.

349
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,900
就是因为火车!
because of trains!

350
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,280
就是那些可恶 该死的火车!
because of the damn trains! damn 'em!

351
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,290
拿它到车站 这位先生要走了
take it to the station. the gentleman's leavin'.

352
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,700
慢着
hold it.

353
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,140
拿回来
take it back.

354
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,500
拿到车站去
take it to the station.

355
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,480
- 进去 - 车站!
- go inside. - the station!

356
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,680
像我们耍的把戏一样
just like the games we know.

357
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,570
- 他拾起它了 - 或者是个把戏
- he's picking it up. - a trick, maybe.

358
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,770
干这一行的人 怎可以用这种小玩意?
how can somebody in my business go around with a contraption like this?

359
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,810
那个小玩意...
that contraption...

360
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,270
差点送你归西了
almost sent you to your grave.

361
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,480
你忘了一件事 我是向着你的帽子开枪
you're forgetting one thing, colonel... I was shooting at your hat.

362
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,780
我只是射你的帽子
well, I was only shooting at yours.

363
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,120
但好像我先开枪
but I recall firing first.

364
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,950
小子...
boy...

365
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,220
我年近五十了
I've reached almost 50 years of age with my system.

366
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,630
很少人在这儿活得久
not many men last long in these parts.

367
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,960
你猜你会活多久?
how long do you expect to last?

368
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,290
比他们的时间长得多
much longer than that.

369
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:59,200
我抓到印迪奥 拿到万元赏金后...
when I get my hands on lndio and that $10,000...

370
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,640
就会买个小地方 退休吧
I'm gonna buy myself a little place, possibly retire.

371
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,180
我认为我们不该再斗
well, I don't believe we ought to start another fight.

372
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,310
但你忘了一件小事
but you forget one small detail.

373
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,910
什么?
what's that?

374
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,250
我也想抓印迪奥
I wanna get my hands on lndio too.

375
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,760
当然 在我得手后
sure, after me.

376
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,690
或在你前头
or before you.

377
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,700
或同一时间
or at the same time.

378
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,490
这算是个建议吗?
Is that a proposition?

379
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,460
平等的拍档关系
an equal partnership.

380
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,400
为什么跟你拍档?
why? why should l?

381
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,410
有三个理由
I can think of three reasons.

382
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,640
首先 他们有十四个人
first is there's 14 of them.

383
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,610
人数不少
yeah, that's a lot.

384
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,240
对于我来说 很多
a lot for me.

385
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,840
两个人合力也未必可以
yeah. no small number even for two of us.

386
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,510
第二个原因呢?
second reason?

387
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,850
第二个原因...
second reason...

388
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,020
第二个原因是 你可能要以一敌十五
the second reason is you could make it 15 to one.

389
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,560
别忘了我也想参与这游戏
don't forget I wanna play in this game too.

390
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,030
你也知道两个猎人 追一个猎物...
as you're aware, when two hunters go after the same prey...

391
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,540
结果只会自相残杀 我们不想这样
they usually end up shooting each other in the back, and we don't want that.

392
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,070
那上校就要死?
then the colonel dies, hmm?

393
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,310
好了 我慷慨一点
all right, I'll be generous.

394
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,650
你拿了印迪奥的赏金...
you can have the reward for lndio...

395
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,920
我拿其他人的赏金 如何?
and I'll take the reward for the rest of the band.

396
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,100
不行...
No

397
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,320
绝对错了
all wrong.

398
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,890
印迪奥值一万元 其他人的加起来更多
Indio's worth $10,000 dollars, but the rest adds up to much more than that.

399
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,530
黑仔值四千 野人值三千 尼尔二千
blackie's worth four, wild's worth three, Nino two.

400
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,260
尼尔一千
Nino's one.

401
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,340
费高二千
well, frisco's worth two.

402
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,900
那就是一万
that's ten thousand.

403
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,880
对 但是...
yeah, but...

404
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,140
一定还有别人 算起来会有更多钱
there's a few more that'll add up to more than that, I'm sure.

405
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,480
- 你怎知道? - 我消息灵通
- how do you know that? - I have my information.

406
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,490
要说的都说了...
when all's said and done...

407
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,620
我还是接受你的建议吧
I think I might just take you up on your proposition.

408
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,130
为这对拍档干杯
Iet's drink to this partnership.

409
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,130
为这拍档干杯 当然不耍把戏
to the partnership, with no tricks, of course.

410
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,970
不耍把戏
no tricks.

411
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,680
那么...
now, then...

412
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:23,150
我们得设法在途中下手
you realize we're gonna have to figure out some way to get them in the middle.

413
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,060
只可以里应外合 别无他法
one from the outside, one from the inside. there's no other way.

414
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,560
我们其中一个要加入印迪奥的团伙中
one of us will have to join lndio's band.

415
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,260
你说"其中一个"时 干嘛看着我?
why are you looking at me when you say "one of us"?

416
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,990
因为他们不认识你
because they don't know you.

417
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,940
野人一见到我就会动怒
wild sees me and his hump will catch on fire.

418
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,100
告诉我...
tell me...

419
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,340
我该如何加入印迪奥一伙?
how do you propose that l join up with lndio?

420
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,380
或者带玫瑰给他吧?
maybe bring him a bunch of roses?

421
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,890
你可以这样做 但你还是带着贝山佐
you could do that, but I'd suggest you take him Sancho Perez.

422
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,250
谁是贝山佐?
who's Sancho Perez?

423
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,260
印迪奥的朋友 他在闲着
a friend of lndio's. right now he's cooling off.

424
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,950
他在何拉莫监狱闲着
he's cooling off in alamogourdo jail.

425
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,590
你怎么知道?
how do you know all this?

426
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,100
我也有消息来源的
I've got my information too.

427
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,200
很自然 你得安排他出狱
naturally, you'll have to arrange for his, uh, release.

428
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,380
对
naturally.

429
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,210
告诉我...
tell me...

430
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,750
你曾经年轻吗?
were you ever young?

431
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,550
曾经像你一样鲁莽
and just as reckless as you.

432
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,890
某天发生了一件事
then one day something happened.

433
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,730
令我觉得生命可贵
made life very precious to me.

434
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,390
什么事?
what's that?

435
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,770
这问题轻率吗?
or is the question indiscreet?

436
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,900
绝不轻率
the question isn't indiscreet.

437
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,240
但答案可能是
but the answer could be.

438
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:19,710
他们说你要坐监 坐四年
they told me you were put away. you'd be resting for four long years in prison.

439
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:26,350
不 只是四星期罢了
no, lndio, for four weeks. no more than four weeks.

440
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,830
那个是什么人?
who is that with you?

441
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,030
他救我出来的 是我的朋友
he got me out. the man's a friend of mine.

442
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,550
他干嘛帮你? 你有问他吗?
why did he help you? did you ask him that?

443
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:58,550
朋友 你为什么救我出来?
yeah. amigo, why did you help me out?

444
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,650
通缉你们的赏金数目可不少...
well, there's such a big reward being offered on all you gentlemen...

445
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,890
我只想跟着你们 干下一次的买卖
that I thought I might just tag along on your next robbery.

446
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,100
或者把你们送治
I might just turn you into the law.

447
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,530
朋友...
amigo...

448
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,380
这一个答案可以证明你可靠
that's the one answer that would prove you're all right.

449
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,040
你来得刚好 计划已经落实
and you arrived just in time too. the job is already set.

450
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,680
是明天
It's tomorrow.

451
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,880
地点是...
the place is...

452
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,390
埃尔帕索的银行
the bank in el paso.

453
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,900
离埃尔帕索不远有个镇 圣克鲁斯
not far from el paso there's a little town, santa cruz.

454
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,460
明天 黑仔 支哥、柏高...
tomorrow, blackie, chico, paco...

455
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,700
还有你...
and you, amigo...

456
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,370
往圣克鲁斯打劫银行
will rob the bank in santa cruz.

457
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,610
开枪、杀人 把区内的枪都抢掉...
shoot, kill, get every gun in the area after you...

458
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,620
特别是埃尔帕索那些
especially those from el paso.

459
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,080
我们去处理其余的
any others around, we'll take care of them.

460
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,890
完成后 大家在拉斯波马拉见
and then after the job, we'll all meet again at las palmeras.

461
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,590
你去哪?
where are you going?

462
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,440
如果要开枪...
well, if there's gonna be any shooting...

463
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,440
我得休息一下
I gotta get my rest.

464
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,490
你昨天讲那个故事时 我信以为真
hey, amigo, you know when you told that story yesterday, I fell for it.

465
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:23,900
大笑话 对吗?
big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

466
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,040
谁说我在说笑?
who said I was jokin'?

467
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,980
我不明白 若那是真的...
I don't get that. If it's true...

468
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,480
可惜你要死
too bad you have to die.

469
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,120
什么事?
what is it?

470
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,920
他们该到了圣克鲁斯
by now they should be at santa cruz.

471
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,780
你听着...
Iisten, shorty...

472
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,160
印迪奥和他的同党 刚打劫了这里的银行
Indio and his band have just robbed the bank here in town.

473
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:40,690
你坐下来 向埃尔帕索那边发警号...
now why don't you just sit down and send out the alarm to el paso...

474
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,640
还有 警告附近的城镇
and the rest of the towns around here and warn 'em, right?

475
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:47,370
但我没听到银行有枪声 我该听到的
but, mister, I didn't hear any shots at the bank, and I sure would have.

476
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,380
你或可以听到一枪
you might hear one.

477
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,070
发警报
the alarm.

478
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,270
别紧张
easynow.

479
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:39,040
他们打劫了圣克鲁斯的银行!
they'verobbedthebank atsantacruz!

480
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,380
跟我来!
followme!

481
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,450
高基 电报电缆
groggy, thetelegraph wires.

482
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,330
- 再见 先生 - 先生 再见
-good day, gentlemen. -good day, sir.

483
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,670
- 先生 - 午安
- sir. - good afternoon.

484
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,450
另外一边
the other side.

485
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,730
十一...
eleven...

486
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,160
十二...
twelve...

487
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,970
十四...
fourteen...

488
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,990
走吧
Iet's go!

489
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:18,360
你在干嘛? 你不是要逃走吧?
what are you doin' here? you're not runnin' away, are you?

490
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,160
我不要逃走
no, I'm not running away.

491
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,900
我要追他们 要自己去 我们拆伙了
I'm going after them and I'm going alone. our partnership is dissolved.

492
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,810
等一等 商量一下吧
boy, let's wait and talk it over.

493
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,010
我们只管空谈 没结果我也没埋怨过
all we've done is talk. I've been reasonable with no results.

494
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,380
我们只知道 他圣克鲁斯那部分的计划
now take it easy. we only knew the santa cruz part of this plan.

495
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,580
是你算出他们的策略的
you were the one who had their strategy all worked out.

496
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:39,280
- 我要去见印迪奥 - 那我也同来
- now I'm gonna meet lndio. - I see. I better go along.

497
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,290
我自己去...一个人去
I'm going alone... me.

498
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,760
我跟印迪奥有约 谁也不能干涉我
I have an appointment with lndio and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

499
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,820
- 你肯定吗? - 是的
- you certain about that? - that's right.

500
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,370
那就很抱歉了
In that case I'm sorry.

501
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,940
这不算太糟 印迪奥派了四个人去圣克鲁斯
that's not bad. Indio sent four men to santa cruz.

502
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:03,210
一个人回来 丝毫无损
and one man returns... a new man without a scratch.

503
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,440
印迪奥不是个傻瓜
mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

504
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,970
若你上前让他看那伤痕 他或会相信你
when you ride up to him and show him that little nick, he might believe you.

505
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:12,150
别忘了 从今天起...
and don't forget, that as of today...

506
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,850
这一帮人值四万多元了
the whole gang's worth $40,000 more.

507
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:17,950
那是银行悬红缉拿他们 的那笔钱
that's the reward offered by the bank to get the money back.

508
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:21,830
- 拍档又合作了吗? - 你怎么想?
- Is the partnership operating again? - just how do you figure?

509
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:26,800
尝试说服印迪奥往北面走 然后沿着里奥布拉窝走
try to convince lndio to go north, and then go along the rio bravo.

510
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:30,070
那里最适合突袭 我们可以合力抓到他
It's a good spot for an ambush and we can get him between two fires.

511
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:33,940
我们里应外合 对吗?
you on the outside, me on the inside, right?

512
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,040
北面吗?
north?

513
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,770
北面
north.

514
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,670
尼尔
hughie.

515
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:15,970
慢着 我们需要时间打开它 这地方不适合
wait a minute. we need time to open it and this isn't the right place.

516
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,140
其他人呢?
and the others?

517
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,680
- 死了? - 对
- dead? - Yeah

518
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:54,040
往圣克鲁斯之后 我们往埃尔帕索走 受到突袭
after santa cruz, we headed for el paso and they hit us from all sides.

519
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,850
你只能自保 对吗? 你这...
and you just saved your own skin, isn't that right, you yellow...

520
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:21,710
你已完成责任 走吧
you did your part of it. Iet's go.

521
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,410
我们往哪里去?
which way we headed?

522
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,850
北面
north.

523
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,110
北面? 沿着里奥布拉窝?
north? along rio bravo canyon?

524
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,780
有何不可?
why not?

525
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,620
那里最容易受突袭
seems like a good place for an ambush to me.

526
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:38,660
还有更好的建议吗?
you know a better way to go?

527
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:40,660
对 南面
yeah, south.

528
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,360
往边界走?
ride to the border?

529
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:48,460
他们没预期你会过境 因为他们已发了警报
they'll never expect you to cross the border now that the alarm's been sent.

530
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,170
还是往东走
think we'll head east.

531
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:00,580
我知道有一个地方 阿加卡兰特
there's a place I know about, agua caliente.

532
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04,640
这就是阿加卡兰特
here we are. that's agua caliente.

533
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,560
我在那里有朋友
yes, I have many friends here.

534
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,560
像个停尸间一样
It looks just like a morgue.

535
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:13,750
不过小心点
but look out.

536
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,960
它有可能变成停尸房
It could be one so easily.

537
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:20,630
- 他们抗拒陌生人 - 他们谁都不喜欢
- they don't like strangers. - no, they don't like anybody.

538
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:26,140
野人 你没见过这位朋友的枪法吧?
wild, you never saw our friend here shoot, right?

539
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,980
你们呢?
did any of you?

540
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,650
我们不知道 你遇上危急情况会怎样
we don't know how you'd be in emergencies.

541
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,720
我在想 这地方很适合
I was thinking, this is the right place.

542
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:44,060
我有个方法 让你显身手
I got a way you can show the men.

543
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,990
怎么样?
how's that?

544
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,230
你自己一人走进城去
go into town alone, amigo.

545
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:38,990
好棒
bravo.

546
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,080
可否说你怎到这里来?
do you mind tellin' me how you got here?

547
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,720
只是分析出来的
I just reasoned it out.

548
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:36,990
我猜你会告诉印迪奥...
I figured you'd tell lndio...

549
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:40,520
走的方向 刚巧是我们说好的相反...
to do just exactly the opposite of what we agreed...

550
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,460
他疑心重 于是走另一个方向
and he's suspicious enough to figure out somethin' else.

551
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:48,300
既然埃尔帕索不是在考虑之列 所以我就来了
since el paso was out of the question, well, here I am.

552
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,170
甜酒 要双份
rum... a double.

553
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,180
大家都饮特奎拉酒
tequila for all of us.

554
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,170
这不是抽烟的朋友吗?
If it isn't the smoker.

555
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,650
记得我吗 朋友?
remember me, amigo?

556
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,990
当然吧...在埃尔帕索
of course you do. el paso.

557
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,530
世界真小
It's a small world.

558
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,330
对 而且还真糟
yes, and very, very bad.

559
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,600
来吧 你又该点火了
now, come on. you light another match.

560
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:52,670
我通常吃完饭才吸烟 十分钟后回来
I generally smoke just after I eat. come back in ten minutes.

561
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:56,650
十分钟后你已死了 起来!
ten minutes you'll be smoking in hell. get up!

562
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,080
冷静一点
stay calm.

563
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,320
站起来
on your feet.

564
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,690
古罗
cucillo.

565
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,360
数三声
count to three.

566
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,140
一...
one...

567
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,640
二...
two...

568
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,880
三!
three!

569
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,320
住手!
stop it!

570
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,510
你是谁?
who are you?

571
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,020
能够为你打开保险箱的人
I'm the one who can open the safe for you.

572
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,220
什么保险箱?
what safe, senor?

573
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,730
埃尔帕索那个 你比我早一步
the one from el paso. you got there ahead of me.

574
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,730
- 不过... - 不过?
- however... - however?

575
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,400
若你打开保险箱 就会毁掉一半银纸
open that safe and you're gonna destroy half the bank notes.

576
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,990
我可以不用炸药弄开它
I can open it without blowing it up.

577
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:35,880
要多少钱?
what'll it cost?

578
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,440
五千元
five thousand.

579
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,020
我只付二千
two's all I'll pay you.

580
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,850
五千
five.

581
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,760
别碰!
keep your hands off it!

582
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:28,290
偷钱倒容易 最难保存的是赃款
It's easy to steal. the trouble is in keeping the loot.

583
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,630
拿它出来
take it out.

584
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,000
现在新墨西哥 人人都在追捕我们
now every man in new mexico is after us.

585
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:36,740
若发现我们跟手上的钱 我们就必死无疑
If they catch one of us with money we'll all end up the same way.

586
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:40,710
若我认为有必要 我们就得等一个月
we're going to wait here for an entire month if I think it's necessary.

587
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:43,750
然后才分赃
then everybody will get his share.

588
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:46,180
你也要等一个月才拿到钱
and you will wait a month to get your money.

589
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,150
这个当然
naturally.

590
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,590
我在小旅馆内
I'll be in the tavern.

591
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:55,790
周围的空气跟食物一样很糟糕
the air around here stinks anyway, just like the food.

592
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,830
但一个月很快就会过去
but the month will go fast.

593
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:39,500
就在这里
right here.

594
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:42,170
走吧
Iet's go.

595
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:08,680
我很担心你
I was worried about you.

596
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:12,620
自己一个人 有那么多难题处理
all alone with, uh, so many problems to solve.

597
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,370
全都在这儿
It's all right here.

598
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,380
去吧
go ahead.

599
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,280
你不该把苹果射下来的
you shouldn't have shot the apples off that tree.

600
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,700
戴着它
put it on.

601
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,990
那个埃尔帕索的警长在干嘛?
what's he doing now, this sheriff of el paso?

602
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:45,340
现在吗? 在找银行失掉的钱
right now? Iookin' for the cash that was in the bank.

603
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,270
对
right.

604
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:53,140
假若他在埃尔帕索镇外 找到这两个人的尸体...
and suppose he finds the bodies of these men just outside el paso...

605
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,510
身上又有很多钱?
with lots of money on them?

606
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,020
警长会怎样想?
what will the sheriff think?

607
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:00,880
他会...
well, he...

608
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,690
对了
that's right.

609
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,490
斯利姆
slim.

610
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:27,330
什么事 尼尔?
what is it, Nino?

611
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,970
计划改变了
a change of plans.

612
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:33,280
印迪奥 想要你...
Indio wants you to...

613
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,590
无子弹的
It's not loaded.

614
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,310
你们该快走了
I think you should get out fast now.

615
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:46,650
你的枪也无子弹
here's your guns without bullets.

616
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:49,620
别让印迪奥在附近找到你们
Iisten. don't you let lndio find you both around.

617
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:41,800
我知道你不喜欢问题 但你为何这样做?
I know you don't like questions, but why are you doing this?

618
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:47,810
你知道蒙哥是赏金猎人有多久了?
how long have you known that monco's a bounty killer?

619
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,980
今晚才知道的 怎么了?
I found out tonight. why?

620
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:58,220
他一到 我就知道他是了
I knew he was one from the first moment he arrived.

621
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,870
另外那个也是赚赏金的
the other one's also a bounty killer.

622
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:10,530
所以我有个主意
so I have an idea.

623
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,770
他们有利用价值
they'll be useful to us.

624
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:15,740
我们试试看
we'll try it.

625
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:20,300
那两个人 比我们有枪的人身手好
those men are a lot better than mine with a gun.

626
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:24,650
我们让他们来一次枪战
so we'll let all of them get mixed up in a gun battle.

627
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,650
但那对于我不重要
but that won't really matter to me.

628
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,780
对你也是
or you.

629
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,960
因为我们已远走高飞了 对吗?
because we'll be far away, right?

630
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,130
我们还拿所有钱
and we'll have all the money.

631
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,510
去吧
go on.

632
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:51,810
去弄醒古罗
go on and wake cucillo.

633
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,890
是谁做的?
who did it?

634
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,520
为何不看看那把刀子?
why don't you look at the knife?

635
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:55,780
是我的
It's mine.

636
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,810
它不该在此吧?
then it shouldn't be there, should it?

637
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:11,590
但我没杀他 不是我做的
but I didn't kill him. I didn't do it.

638
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,760
很难证明的
It's difficult to prove that.

639
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,990
印迪奥 我是无辜的
I am innocent.

640
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:23,590
你的马在外面
one of your horses is outside.

641
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,140
看你能否跑到它那里
Iet's see if you can get to it.

642
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:55,570
印迪奥?
lndio

643
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:16,380
他刚杀了瘦子
he just killed slim.

644
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,590
他还帮那两个赏金猎人逃走
and he... he helped those two bounty killers get away.

645
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,660
找他们回来...
I want them back...

646
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:31,000
现在就去
right now.

647
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,570
马上去
right now.

648
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,240
马上去
right now.

649
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,220
你们在干嘛?
what are you doing here?

650
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:48,780
去抓他们!
go and get them back!

651
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,650
高基
groggy

652
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:57,860
那两个赏金猎人威胁着我们 要马上干掉他们
those two bounty killers are sitting on our backs and must be killed right away.

653
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,870
不可以让他们走
we can't let 'em go free.

654
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:21,050
好了
It's done now.

655
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:25,360
准备离开这里
prepare to get out of here.

656
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,570
来 尼尔
here.

657
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,000
别动
hold it.

658
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:20,480
这个主意不错 印迪奥
not a bad idea.

659
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:23,070
但你忘了我
but I'm one thing you forgot about.

660
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:24,850
把门打开
open it up now.

661
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,870
好了 快打开它
all right, come on now, open it.

662
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,830
我来应付印迪奥
Ieave lndio to me.

663
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,260
好吧
all right.

664
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:28,730
到底它在哪里?
where in hell is it?

665
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,500
我要把他们碎尸万段 不过要先取他们的胆出来
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip out their guts first.

666
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:02,510
我有个计划
I have a plan.

667
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:10,970
什么?
what?

668
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:13,180
我们等吧
Iet's just wait.

669
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,380
他们会回来的
they'll be back here.

670
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,690
这样我们可以互相照应
and this way, there'll be two of us.

671
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,920
他们能回来吗? 你的人或已杀了他们
can they come back here? your men could've killed them.

672
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,930
谁? 他们?
who? they?

673
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:33,240
肯定吗? 他们没有吗?
are you sure of that? that they haven't?

674
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:39,050
我的想法不同
I thought something different.

675
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:43,960
你命人出去尽快把他们干掉
you made the boys ride on out to make sure they're both killed, and fast.

676
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:47,220
我不像其他人那么笨
I'm not as dumb as the rest of them.

677
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,330
当时根本没办法
there was no help for it.

678
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,080
去吧
go on.

679
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:14,500
那个手表...
that watch...

680
01:58:15,970 --> 01:58:18,770
我早已经想问你
It's been a long time that I wanted to ask.

681
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:23,010
我看得出它对你很有意义
I can see that it means a lot to you.

682
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,600
为什么?
why?

683
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:58,460
印迪奥!
lndio

684
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:02,900
听我说
Iisten to me!

685
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,910
我是莫上尉!
this is colonel Mortimer!

686
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,150
道格拉斯•莫蒂默!
Douglas Mortimer!

687
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,820
这名字你听过没有?
does the name mean anything to you?

688
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:51,820
音乐声停了 就拾起你的枪
