1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,370
在21世纪末，全球化学战争发生后

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,922
地球几乎完全无法可居住

3
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,010
居住空间成了最珍贵的资源

4
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,310
只有两个地域还可以住人

5
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:08,312
英国联邦

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:15,319
和殖民地

7
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,158
殖民地的工人每天
以唯一可用的交通工具

8
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:29,545
走遍地球每处，这工具就是
地心车

9
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,971
醒来，醒来
Wake up. Wake up.

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,299
醒来
Wake up.

11
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,404
我截断电源了
I cut the power.

12
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,913
我们大约有十秒时间
We've got about ten seconds

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,082
十秒后警钟便呜响
惊动整队人到来
before that alarm
brings an entire team down here.

14
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,329
来
Here.

15
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,704
- 我们要去了
- 好的，去
- We need to go.
- Okay, go.

16
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,459
去
Go.

17
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,661
好的，来
Okay, come on.

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,933
我爱你
I love you.

19
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,277
你现在告诉我？
You tell me now?

20
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,071
我爱你
I love you.

21
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,627
去！
Go!

22
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,612
不！不！不！
No!No!No!

23
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,082
我们去
Let go.

24
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,242
你现在就要去
You have to go now.

25
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,249
- 不，我不会离开你
- 我们去
- No. I won't leave you.
- Let go.

26
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,962
- 不
- 我答应会找你
- No.
- I promise I'll find you.

27
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,585
你要去
You have to go.

28
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,332
去！去！
Go! Go!

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,286
又发恶梦吗？
You have another nightmare?

30
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,492
是
Yeah.

31
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,746
宝贝，我们要怎样帮你？
Baby, what are we going to do with you?

32
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,337
我不知道
I don't know.

33
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,508
想谈谈你的梦吗？
Do you want to talk about it?

34
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,721
没有什么好谈的
There's nothing to talk about.

35
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,387
相同的梦吗？
Same dream?

36
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,436
相同的梦
Same dream.

37
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,275
相同的时间
Same time.

38
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,404
有人追捕我
I'm trapped, being chased.

39
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,694
我逃不掉
Can't get away.

40
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,075
接着我醒来
And then I wake.

41
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,445
就这么样吗？
And that's it?

42
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,581
只有你，没有其他人吗？
It's just you, nobody else?

43
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,289
不，只有我
No. Just me.

44
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,996
是因为我吗？
Is it me?

45
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,789
什么是你？
Is what you?

46
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,883
我不知道
I don't know.

47
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,050
只有你一人，你逃不了
You're alone. You can't get away.

48
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,514
是我们吗？
Is it us?

49
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,683
- 是我令你觉得受困吗？
- 不
- Do I make you feel trapped?
- No.

50
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,640
宝贝
Babe,

51
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,143
我知道我们
I know this isn't exactly

52
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,316
年轻时没有想过这事，但…
what we had in mind when
we were younger, but...

53
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,438
这堡垒？
This castle?

54
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,151
谁令我们幻想的一切成真了？
Who gets everything
they fantasize about, right?

55
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,910
我有了你
<i>L</i> 9011 you.

56
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,745
过来
Come here.

57
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,455
只不过是发梦罢了
It's just a dream. That's all it is.

58
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,453
知道吗？
Okay?

59
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,676
我们要令你发些好梦
Well, we're going to have to
get you some better dreams.

60
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,921
这不错呢
That would be nice.

61
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,302
来
Oh, come on.

62
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,636
紧急

63
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,022
- 该死
- 怎么了？
- Shit.
- What is it?

64
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,726
他们又炸英国联邦了
Another bombing in the U.F.B.

65
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,357
是载客火车
Passenger train.

66
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,904
该死的反动组织
Goddamn Resistance.

67
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:48,980
紧急医疗技术人员

68
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,327
我要赶搭六时半的班次离开
I'm going to have to
catch the 6:30 departure.

69
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,326
他们召集所有紧急人员上去
They're calling
all emergency personnel to go up top.

70
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,249
我要走了
I got to go.

71
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,755
我们今晚再继续，好吗？
We'll pick this up tonight, okay?

72
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,962
再睡一会
Try and get a little sleep.

73
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,680
我怕了睡觉
Sleep scares me.

74
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,308
梦见我吧
Well, dream of me.

75
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,555
好的
Okay.

76
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,512
但不要梦见我穿这裤子
But not in these pants.

77
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,277
乘客上车后不久便爆炸
The bomb went off just moments
after the commuters boarded.

78
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,272
火车遇袭突发新闻报导

79
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,949
据悉拯救队仍在搜索生还者
We are being told rescue teams
are still searching for survivors.

80
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,574
目前的死亡人数是144人
人数还在不断上升
The death toll is at 144 and still rising.

81
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,783
这是英国联邦在多月来第四次遇袭
This marks the fourth attack in United
Federation of Britain in as many months.

82
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,290
种种迹象均显示是
恐怖份子首领麦费思
And all signs point
to terrorist leader Matthias

83
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,167
和他的反动组织所为
and his Resistance movement.

84
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,090
英联剥削我们
The U. F.B. exploits us.

85
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,669
殖民地的工人应该获得平等待遇
The workers of The Colony deserve equality.

86
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,222
地心车将我们变成奴隶
The Fall enslaves us all.

87
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,300
高克根大臣以此证明
Chancellor Cohaagen
pointed to this as proof

88
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,386
麦费思不会以和平手段
that Matthias does not seek a peaceful path

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,814
争取殖民地独立
而是采取持久的血腥冲突
to independence for The Colony,
but rather a prolonged and bloody conflict.

90
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,393
英联的过剩人口不断上升
And with overpopulation
figures in the U. F.B. continuing to rise,

91
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,524
袭击偏偏在这个时候发生
this could not come at a worse time.

92
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,731
大家应该记得对上一次袭击
是在六星期前发生
You'll recall the last attack
occurred six weeks ago.

93
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,907
联邦警察一直指袭击是由
加路孝生发动的
Federal police have since attributed
that bombing to this man, Carl Hauser,

94
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,114
加路孝生是前情报人员
其后反叛
a former intelligence officer turned traitor

95
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,790
现在被视为麦费思的左右手
now considered to be
Matthias' right-hand man.

96
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,745
现时还没有消息得知
孝生跟今早的事件有何关系
No word yet as to whether Hauser
had a role in this morning's incident.

97
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,374
有地方要去吗？没有？
Going somewhere? No?

98
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,168
那么别让它妨碍你
Well, don't let that stop you.

99
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,995
那幻想还是永远无法成真吗？
That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?

100
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,079
我们令幻想成真

101
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,506
不再无法成真了
Not anymore.

102
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,379
利高公司为你
At Rekall, we'll provide you

103
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,212
提供整套唯你独有的记忆
with a complete set
of memories all your own.

104
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,261
利高公司
Rekall.

105
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,383
我们为你记事
We can remember it for you.

106
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,464
利高公司

107
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,984
请各位乘客到指定的闸口报到
All passengers, please report
to your designated gates.

108
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,368
七时十五分开出的班次
最后召集乘客上车
This is the final boarding call
for the 7:15 departure.

109
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,177
面对事实吧！
Wake up to the truth!

110
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,846
高克根希望你满足现状
Cohaagen is counting on your complacency.

111
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,050
别让他们将你像牛羊般运到他方
Don't let them ship you
across the Earth like cattle.

112
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,600
来，走
Come on, move.

113
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,097
麦费思二真理

114
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,268
麦费思说的是真相！
Matthias speaks the truth!

115
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,769
地心车将我们变成奴隶！
The Fall enslaves us all!

116
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,104
地心车将我们变成奴隶

117
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,029
- 老友，你精神很差
- 所有A部门的班次都在第二层…
- Hey, buddy. You look like shit, man.
- All section A departures are located...

118
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,522
- 谢谢
- 没意板罪你
- Thanks.
- No offense.

119
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,150
我的精神是很差
你没有开罪我
I feel like shit. None taken.

120
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,698
我睡得不好，老友
I ain't sleeping so well, man.

121
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,030
新轮班时间也害得我好惨
Yeah, these new shifts
are kicking my ass, too.

122
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,832
至少加薪让我太太放心些
At least the extra pay
lets the missus rest easier.

123
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,867
看你
Look at you.

124
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,537
晨早六点只有半条人命
Mr. Glass-is-half-full at 6:00 a.m.

125
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,664
你好
Hola. Privyet.

126
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,465
欢迎到地心车
Welcome to The Fall.

127
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,260
上午七时二十一分
7:21 a.m.

128
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,723
往英国联邦的旅程需要十七分钟
Travel time to United Federation of Britain:
17 minutes.

129
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,222
还有六十秒便下堕
Dropping in 60 seconds.

130
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,808
有留意到
Has it ever occurred to you

131
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,890
我们总是坐同一个座位吗？
that we always sit in these exact same seats?

132
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,188
很多年了…为什么？
For years now... Why?

133
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,061
不知道
I don't know.

134
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,237
它们是座位，我们有屁股
They're seats. We have asses.

135
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,648
似乎是很合逻辑的事
Seems like the logical thing to do.

136
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,701
我是指我们永远依循相同的程序
I'm talking about us following
the same routine, all right,

137
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,996
日复日，年复年，从不质疑
day after day, year after year
without even questioning it.

138
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,826
想改变一下吗？
Want to switch it up?

139
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,000
易过借火
No sweat.

140
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,330
请大家离开座位前
Please make sure
all personal belongings are stored

141
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,132
将私人物品放在椅底
below your seat before departure.

142
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,509
噢
Oh, yeah.

143

高克根谈清洗殖民地计划
Despite recent talks
between Chancellor Cohaagen

151
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,698
虽然高克根大臣

152
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,248
最近跟殖民地的总督谈过
and The Colony's governor,

153
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,793
但大臣宣布有鉴于今早的炸弹袭击

in light of this morning's bombing.

155
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,669
我致力清洗殖民地
As much as I want to focus our efforts
on cleaning up The Colony,

156
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,718
今天的恐怖袭击显示
today's terrorist attacks means that funding

157
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:10,222
我们需要将款项
用于加强联邦的机械警力
will have to go to bolstering
our synthetic federal police force.

158
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,639
我们永远以保护市民为先
The protection of our citizens
will always come first.

159
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,190
现正迈向地心

- 是
- That mind-altering shit?

170
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,802
杜格，我劝你别惹他们
Do yourself a favor, Doug,
stay away from them.

171
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,303
为什么？
Why is that?

172
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,976
记得第三班有个戴维思吗？
Remember Travis from shift three?

173
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,105
- 戴维思
- 他在婚前光顾利高公司
- Travis.
- Went to Rekall for his bachelor party.

174
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,520
他想成为火星之王或什么的

175
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,101
我也想去火星

来
Come on.

182
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,080
你从不想这个吗，只想一点儿？
You never thought about it, just a little bit?

183
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,251
我不需要想它
I don't need to think about it.

184
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,046
别胡思乱想
Don't mess with your mind, man.

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,506
不值得呢
It ain't worth it.

186
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,753
好吧，听好
All right, all right, listen up.

187
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,584
也许我需要胡思乱想
Maybe I need my mind messed with.

188
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,964
我们又开始轮双班了
We're starting double shifts again.

我跟你一样不想待在这儿
知道吗？
I don't want to be here
any longer than you do, okay?

192
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,307
因为今早的事件
They've increased
the production of police synthetics

193
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,762
他们增加了机械警察的生产量
所以…
thanks to that shit this morning, so...

194
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,393
向高克根大臣
So take all your complaints

195
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,349
投诉吧
to Chancellor Cohaagen.

196
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,980
你们这班殷实的混蛋之中
Now, which one of you
fine, upstanding assholes

197
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,107

Come on.

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,360
唏

来
Come on.

201
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,153
别看着我
Don't look at me.

202
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,412
你最后炒的那个是我训练的
I trained the last guy you fired.

203
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,458
- 葛特
- 是
- Quaid.
- Yeah.

204
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:40,993
你升级
You're up.

205
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,915
- 很好，多谢
- 别客气

temporarily offline.

208
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,061
别那样扶着
Don't hold it like that.

209
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,358
扶这儿
Hold it here.

210
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,481
扶着那儿会短路的
If you hold it there and the synth shorts,

211
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,734
会有螺栓射穿你的手
one of those bolts
will shoot straight through your hand.

212
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,323
不是说笑的，知吗？
No Shit, huh?

213
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,491
不是说笑的
No shit.

Thanks.

216
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,619
你的朋友错了

217
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,169
关于利高公司
About Rekall.

218
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,588

已经三次了
Been three times already.

220
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,467

00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,336
我有史以来最美妙的回忆
Best memories I have.

222
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,509
比这个好得多
A whole lot better than this shit.

223
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,511
唏
Hey.

224
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,347
找阿麦吧
Ask for Mac.

225
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,184
知吗？你会高兴得感谢我
Okay? You're going to thank me.

226
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,271
第9层，请向厂方报到
Level nine,
please report to Human Resources.

227
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,197
醒定些，这家伙不好惹
Strap yourself in.
This guy's a laugh-a-minute.

228
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,361
下一位

是，在启动组

我知你住在殖民地

233
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,302
是，我像所有人一样坐车来
Yeah, I make the commute
like everyone else.

234
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,089
对不起，你是谁？
Sorry, who are you?
If you don't mind my asking.

235
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,884
- 我属于高克根行政部
- 明白
- I'm with the Cohaagen administration.
- I see.

236
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:26,141
现在政局紧张，我们高度关注
Given these politically charged times,
there is a heightened concern regarding the,

237
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,319
我们员工的忠诚
shall we say, loyalty of our workers.

238
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,943
- 但我不是为你工作
- 但你是
- Yeah, but I don't work for you.
- But you do.

239
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,571
这公司获批政府的机械警察合约
This company was granted
the government contract for police synths,

240
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,904
而我们是政府
and we are, the last time I checked,
the government.

241
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,292
我明白了
你叫我来是因为我居住的地方
Okay, I see. So you brought me in here
because of where I live.

242
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,709
我们叫所有员工来
We're bringing in all the employees.

243
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,583
真的？谁会问行政人员？
Oh, really? Who's questioning the suits?

244
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,381
谁会问你？
Who gets to question you?

245
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,583
葛特先生
Mr. Quaid,

246
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,347
你的工作可以接触
机械警察技术的机密
in your capacity here, you are privy to police
synth technology that is currently classified.

247
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,470
我知道怎样开着它们
I know how to turn 'em on,
if that's what you mean.

248
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,303
我们希望你签字
We'd like you to sign this.

249
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,013
这是什么？
And what is that?

250
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,349
确认你不会泄露专有技术
It affirms that you will not
divulge proprietary technology

251
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,435
不向国内国外任何人泄露
to any source, either foreign or domestic.

252
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,612
和你没有参加
And that you are not actively engaged

253
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,190
任何企图推翻这个政权的活动
in any attempt to overthrow
this administration.

254
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,867
你想我签纸说我不是恐布份子？
You want me to sign something
that says I'm not a terrorist?

255
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,664
这份文件只是确认你自称的身份
The document merely affirms
you are who you say you are.

256
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,081
如果我是恐布份子
And if I were a terrorist,

257
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,250
你以为它会令我供出来？
you think this would make me tell you?

258
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,952
- 这是你们的伟大计划？
- 葛特先生…
- Is that your guy's big plan?
- Mr. Quaid...

259
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,378
你们捉到人未？
You catch anyone yet?

260
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,081
我今日还要见75个人
I have 75 more of these interviews today.

261
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,882
你知嘛？我今日工作得好累
Yeah, you know what, pal?
I had a long day, too.

262
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,464
如果你想再有工作，收声和照办
Well, if you'd like to have another,
you'll shut up and do what you're told.

263
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,553

Wow.

A部门的班次在40…
Section A departures will reopen in 40...

271
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:49,326
累了一整天了，去睡吧
发个甜梦 - 吻与拥抱

272
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,647
终于了
All right, finally.

273
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,228
- 为健康干杯
- 天啊

274
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,688

是
Yeah.

279
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,412
唏，梅利，例牌
Hey, Murray. Same.

280
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,581
有学过弹钢琴吗？
You ever learn how to play the piano?

281
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,834
我一直想学弹
Yeah, I always wanted
to learn to play the piano.

282
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,004
你今天怎么了？
What's with you today?

283
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,835
什么？
What?

284
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,546
不单止是为了升职的事吧
Yeah, exactly.

285
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,180
你今天心不在焉
You've been zoned out all day.

286
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,138
我老是发那些梦
I've been having these dreams.

287
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,730
梦？
Dreams?

288
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,809
对，我觉得
Yeah, feels

289
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,686
我在做一些事情…
like I'm doing something...

290
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,362
一些事情…
Something...

291
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,194
一些要紧的事情
一些重要的事情，知道吗？
Something that matters,
something important, you know?

292
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,444
不，不大知道
Nope, not so much.

293
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,786
你认为我们做的工作不重要吗？
You don't think what we do is important?

294
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,004
的确？来，哈利
Really? Come on, Harry.

295
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,879
我们老远来到做无聊的工作
We commute halfway
around the world for shit jobs,

296
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,304
人工又低，来这鬼酒吧
喝这些鬼酒喝至大醉
for shit pay, to come to this shit bar
and get drunk on too much shit beer.

297
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,716
- 梅利，我无意冒犯
- 唔
- No offense, Murray.
- Yeah.

298
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,180
什么？你真的很满意你的生活吗？
What? Are you actually happy
with how your life's turned out?

299
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,392
- 我为什么要？
- 你是认真的？
- Why the hell shouldn't I be?
- Are you serious?

300
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,646
我的生活有什么不妥吗？
Is there something wrong with it?

301
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,603
没有，知道吗？你说得对
算了吧
No. You know what? You're right. Forget it.

302
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,063
我只是…
I'm just...

303
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,114
算了吧
Forget it.

304
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,315
那女孩是谁？
Who's the girl?

305
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,575
你说什么？
What do you mean?

306
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,494
你听见的，那女孩是谁？
You heard me. Who's the girl?

307
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,744
没有女孩，只是我的问题
There's no girl. It's just me.

308
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,951
好
Good.

309
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,588
因为像罗莉这样的女人不易找
'Cause women like Lori
don't just fall out of the sky.

310
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,333
你很幸运
You're a lucky man.

311
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,966
你的生活是我梦寐以求的
You're living the dream, my friend.

312
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,091
- 真的？
- 真的
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

313
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,514
- 梦寐以求？
- 是
- I'm living the dream?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,017
好吧，老兄，明天见
All right, big guy. Tomorrow.

315
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,273
唏
Hey.

316
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,192
想听我的意见吗？
My advice?

317
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,690
说吧
Go ahead.

318
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,275
及早想法子解决你面对的问题
Figure out a way to deal with
whatever the hell it is you're going through

319
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,951
以免它毁了你的一生
before you mess your shit up for good.

320
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,873
我可能喝得太多了
It's possible I might have drank too much.

321
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,247
哈利，可能是吧
Yeah, it's possible, Harry.

322
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,037
我想吐
I'm going to go throw up on something now.

323
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,380
- 好的
- 之后你会回复理性
- Okay.
- And you're going to get your shit together

324
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,046
然后回家，听见吗？
and go home to your wife, you hear me?

325
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,503
哈利，我想人人都听见你了
Yeah, I think everyone heard you, Harry.

326
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,182
杜格，晚安
Night, Dougie.

327
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,226
晚安
Good night.

328
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,110
你像在找什么似的
Seem like you're looking for something.

329
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,612
是这个吗？
Is it this?

330
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,164
怎样都可以
Anything goes here.

331
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,627
相信我，你会恨不得有三只手
Trust me, baby,
you're gonna wish you had three hands.

332
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,080
我在找利高公司
I'm looking for Rekall.

333
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,044
你知道在哪儿吗？
You know where I can find it?

334
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,376
到天堂的阶梯，在那边
Stairway to heaven, over there.

335
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,294
利高公司

336
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,635
我无法改变你的想法？
我很互动的
Sure I can't change your mind?
I'm a lot more interactive.

337
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,137
相信是
I bet.

338
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,097
谢谢
Thank you.

339
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,387
欢迎光临利高公司
Welcome to Rekall.

340
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,840
第一次惠顾吗？
First time?

341
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,849
对，很明显，对？
Yeah. That obvious, huh?

342
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,594
很好
It's fine.

343
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,557
没有什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

344
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,556
这儿很安全
This is a safe place.

345
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,820
我的朋友马力给我这名片
他叫我找阿麦
My friend Marek gave me this card,
told me to ask for Mac.

346
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,367
- 他在里面
- 谢谢
- He's right inside.
- Thanks.

347
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,794
请尽兴
Remember to have a good time.

348
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,142
欢迎
Welcome.

349
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,390
唏
Hey.

350
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,388
你是马力的朋友
You're a friend of Marek's.

351
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,015
是
Yes.

352
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,564
我们一起工作
Yeah, we work together.

353
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,858
就是那个吗？
Is that it?

354
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,481
就是这个
That is it.

355
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,400
感觉很真实的吗？
And it feels like real life?

356
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,154
生活只是脑袋
对所见事物的化学认知？
What is life but our brain's
chemical perception of it?

357
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,453
脑袋对你眼所见的产生化学反应
Your eyes see, your brain chemistry reacts.

358
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,160
我们只是删除中间媒体
直接产生化学作用
Here, we just remove the middleman
and we go straight to the chemistry.

359
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,162
真实感会稍逊吗？
Does that make it any less real?

360
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,459
幻象不管多真实终归都是幻象
An illusion, no matter how convincing,
is still just an illusion.

361
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,168
很好
That's very good.

362
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,969
客观来说你是对的
You're right, objectively.

363
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,760
但从内心来说
But from the inside,

364
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,595
主观上…
subjectively...

365
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,181
我可以保证，情况是完全相反
I assure you, it's quite the opposite entirely.

366
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,146
我明白了
Listen, I get it.
I get it.

367
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,019
你在这里因为你觉得缺少了什么
You're here because
you feel like something's missing.

368
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,193
你受到牵引，想对什么知多一点
You got some tug, some longing
for something more.

369
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,020
我们会令你如愿
We're going to give you that thing.

370
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,275
是吗？
Is that right?

371
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,900
那可能是你永远无法办到的
Could be something
you could never afford to do.

372
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:42,079
可能是你一直想尝试
但又从来不敢尝试的秘密
Something secret you've always wanted
to try, but you would never, ever dare.

373
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,872
你说的秘密是什么意思？
What do you mean, secret?

374
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,119
什么都可以
Anything.

375
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,792
说出你的幻想
我们便会给你回忆
Tell us your fantasy.
We'll give you the memory.

376
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,378
你想富有出名吗？
You want to be rich and famous?

377
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,831
想受千万人崇拜吗？
Worshiped by millions?

378
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,840
或者是更刺激的事情吗？
Maybe something
with a little more adrenaline, huh?

379
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,669
罪恶克星？世界级运动员？
Crime fighter? Or world-class athlete?

380
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,717
密探，很适合你，是吗？
Secret agent. That's you. Right?

381
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,302
秘密银行帐户
Clandestine bank accounts,

382
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,967
- 密码讯息
- 密探
-coded messages.
- Secret agent.

383
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,684
我可以办到
I could do that.

384
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,683
对，是密探
Yeah, as an intelligence operative.

385
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,855
你可能为反动组织工作
You could be working for the Resistance.

386
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,688
你可能为高克根工作
Maybe you work for Cohaagen.

387
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,523
为何限死白己？
为何不是为两者工作？
Or why limit yourself? Why not both?

388
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,112
杜格，最后
One last thing, Doug.

389
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,490
要让你彻底明白
As a matter of full disclosure,

390
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,333
你选的秘密生活元素全都是不真实的
none of the secret life elements
you chose can actually be true.

391
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,454
很多人
See, the thing is, a lot of guys

392
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,504
到这里来，想在现实生活以外
come in here, they want
the secret mistress trip

393
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,924
多一位秘密情人
when they already have one,
a real one, on the side.

394
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,046
这点我们办不到
We can't do that.

395
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,795
这会构成无法弥补的冲突和混乱
It would cause
irreparable conflict and confusion.

396
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,755
这会令大脑崩溃
That's how brains get blown.

397
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,715
别担心，我没有任何秘密
Don't worry, I don't have any secrets.

398
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,600
我肯定你没有
只是以防万一
I'm sure you don't, but just in case,

399
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,769
我们必需为你进行身心状况检查
we're going to run
a psycho-polygraphic panel on you anyway.

400
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,016
马格思，动手
Marcus, go.

401
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,025
特务 - 档案：94422686

402
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,237
你会享受其中
You're going to have such a good time,

403
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,664
不想回来
you're not going to want to come back.

404
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,539
看
Look at that.

405
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,084
看来你太太有个爱慕者
Looks like your wife
does have a man who appreciates her.

406
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,836
这点没有冲突
No conflict there.

407
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,044
对不起，目前这还是
将化学物质注入人体的最佳方法
Sorry. Still the best way
to get chemicals into the human body.

408
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,136
好的
All right.

409
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,888
我们开始
Let's get this show on the road.

410
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,095
准备拯救世界
Get ready to save the world.

411
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,771
老友，顺风
Happy trails, man.

412
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,394
稍后你可以把情况告诉我…
You can tell me all about it when you get...

413
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,029
等等
Wait.

414
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,322
什么？
What?

415
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,398
该死
Shit.

416
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,482
该死？怎么了？有什么不妥？
Shit? What is it? What's wrong?

417
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,659
在药力发作前把针拔掉
Yank that needle out before it takes.

418
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,327
是什么？有什么不妥？
What is it? What's wrong?

419
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,746
- 你说谎
- 说什么谎？
- You lied.
- Lied about what?

420
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,664
- 混蛋
- 我没有情妇
- Son of a bitch.
- Look, I don't have a mistress.

421
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,740
- 你在说什么
- 情妇？
- What are you talking about?
- Mistress?

422
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,916
你是间谍
You're a goddamn spy.

423
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,290
生命征状不稳定
Vitals are everywhere.

424
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,455
你来这里干吗？为什么？
Why are you here? Why?

425
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,249
联邦警察！
Federal police!

426
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,515
- 联邦警察！站起来！
- 不，等等
- Federal police! On your feet now!
- No, wait!

427
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,218
你们搅错了！全都…
This is all a mistake! It's all...

428
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,515
我是普通人
I'm nobody.

429
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,977
- 我是普通人
- 举手！
- I'm nobody.
- Hands on your head now!

430
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,232
好的
Okay.

431
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,316
转身！
Turn around!

432
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,941
好
Okay.

433
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,846
该死
Holy shit.

434
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,392
118.5，代码6
105北…
118.5, code six. 105 north...

435
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,442
去
Go!

436
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,936
走
Move, move, move!

437
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,237
联邦警察！
Federal police!

438
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,959
第一组
Team one, have you

439
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,207
你捉到疑犯了吗？
secured the suspect?

440
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,164
第一组，答话
告诉我你那边发生什么事
Team one, advise.
Let me know what's going on in there.

441
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,843
史提芬，拍摄情况
Stevens, get an eyeball in there now.

442
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,353
该死，全都死了
Shit. They're all down.

443
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,609
他单独行动！
He's all alone!

444
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,281
破门
Let's punch it.

445
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,234
上锁

446
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,127
退后！退后！
Fall back! Fall back!

447
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,584
守着出口！
Cover the exit!

448
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,542
在当局形容为恐怖袭击的事件中
In what is being described

449
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,915
利高公司大堂枪击事件
证实20人死亡
as a terrorist attack,
a solitary gunman opened fire

450
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,213
一名独行枪手在位于

451
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,090
费蒙市中心的利高公司大堂
向一队联邦警员开火
on a squadron of federal police
at the Rekall Lounge in downtown Fremont.

452
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,295
我们仍在等候
We are still awaiting word

453
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,427
- 公布确实的伤亡数字
- 是
-on precisely how many casualties there are.
- Yes.

454
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,258
- 但官员现在确定…
- 好的
- But officials now confirming...
- Okay.

455
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,264
…至少有20名警员被枪杀…
...that at least 20 officers have been killed...

456
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,016
杜格，天
Oh, my God, Doug.

457
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,600
我明白
I understand. Yeah.

458
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,936
- 谢谢
- 罗莉
- Thank you.
- Lon.

459
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,148
- 你在这里真好
- 我当然在这里
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Of course I'm here.

460
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,445
我担心得要死
I've been going out of my mind.

461
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,942
你到哪里去了？
Where have you been?

462
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,944
看，有事发生了
Look, something bad has happened.

463
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,442
不，我知，我刚才接到电话
No, I know. I just got the call.

464
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,617
我们全都要随时候命
We've all been put on standby.

465
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,869
你不明白
You don't understand.

466
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,198
什么？
What?

467
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,581
天
Oh, my God.

468
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,877
杜格，你没事吧？
Doug, are you okay?

469
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,931
罗莉，不是反动份子杀那些警卫的
Lori, it wasn't the Resistance
who killed those sentries.

470
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,598
不是恐怖份子
It wasn't terrorists.

471
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,309
是我
It was me.

472
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,056
你什么？
What was you?

473
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,138
罗莉，是我杀他们的
Lori, I'm the one who killed them.

474
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,149
你杀了20名持枪的人？
You killed 20 armed men?

475
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,398
不，只是10个
No. No, it was more like ten.

476
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,109
但你杀了他们吗？
But you killed them?

477
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,357
你用什么杀人，用书吗？
With what, honey, your book?

478
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,992
- 罗莉，我说真的
- 杜格，你吓怕我了！
- Lori, look, I'm serious.
- Doug, you're scaring me!

479
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,619
对不起
I'm sorry.

480
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,161
听来真疯狂？
This is going to sound crazy, okay?

481
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,537
下班后我去了利高公司
I went to Rekall after work.

482
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,913
- 那么…
- 什么？
- And. ..
- What?

483
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,336
- 他们对你做了什么？
- 什么都没有
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

484
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,335
什么都没有
我坐在椅上，他们替我接上仪器
Nothing.
I sat in the chair, they hooked me up.

485
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,542
他们什么都未做警方便冲进来
Before they could do anything,
the police burst in.

486
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,006
他们想抓我
They tried to take me.

487
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,462
我自然地反应
And I just reacted.

488
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,516
杀了他们
And I killed them.

489
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,719
杜格，听好，你没有杀人
Listen, you didn't kill anyone, Doug.

490
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,596
相信我，全都是我杀的
Trust me, I killed everyone.

491
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,099
不，甜心，你不明白吗？
No, sweetheart, don't you see?

492
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,777
你以为自己做过什么都跟这个无关
Whatever you think you did
had nothing to do with any of this.

493
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,570
那些混蛋干扰你的脑袋
Those assholes screwed with your mind,

494
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,990
你出现偏执幻觉
and now you're having some
kind of a paranoid delusion.

495
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,284
那些地方真的很危险
Those places are really dangerous.

496
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,697
不论发生了什么事
我们都会安然渡过
Whatever it is that happened,
we're going to get through it.

497
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,452
过来，来
Come here. Come on.

498
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,078
来
Come on.

499
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,952
来得太突然了
It happened so fast.

500
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,584
没事的，我们可以解决
It's okay, we'll figure it out.

501
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,755
模拟疑犯样貌

502
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,832
特别报告
疑犯仍然在逃

503
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,885
对不起
I'm sorry.

504
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,259
罗莉，我无法呼吸
Lori, I can't breathe.

505
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,594
来
Come on.

506
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,601
你做什么？
What the hell are you doing?

507
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,822
罗莉，怎么…
Lori, what the fuck...

508
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,295
罗莉，怎么…
Lori, what the...

509
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,640
罗莉，你做什么？
Lori, goddamn it, what are you doing?

510
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,146
执行职务
My Job.

511
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,560
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

512
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,145
我疯了吗？
Am I crazy?

513
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,151
杜格，问得好
That's a good one, Doug.

514
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,025
考虑到你根本不知道你是谁
Considering you don't even know
who the hell you are.

515
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,574
你真的以为一个工厂工人可以
Do you really believe
a factory worker could take out

516
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,326
干掉多名受过精密训练的人员吗？
an entire room of highly-trained men?

517
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,504
告诉我发生什么事
Tell me what is going on.

518
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,759
说呀！
Talk!

519
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,183
也许我们直截了当说
“直至死亡把我们分辟”
Or we can skip straight to
"Until death do us part."

520
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,517
我不是你太太
I'm not your wife.

521
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,021
一派胡言，我们结婚七年了
That's bullshit.
We've been married seven years.

522
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,362
我是英联国际刑警
被派来扮作你太太
I'm U.F.B. police intel,
assigned to play your wife.

523
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,697
六星期前，我根本不认识你
Six weeks ago, I didn't even know you.

524
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,405
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

525
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,703
是真的
It's true.

526
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,370
你的记忆给抹掉了
他们替你植入
Your memory was erased,
your mind was implanted

527
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,918
你以为过了一辈子过的生活
with a life you think you've lived.

528
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,953
宝贝，明白吗？
You keeping up, baby?

529
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,627
根本从来没有一个
叫杜格拉斯葛特的人
There is no Douglas Quaid, there never was.

530
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,878
你是说我不…
Are you saying I don't...

531
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,175
这…
This...

532
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,135
每个…我们的婚姻…
Every... Our marriage...

533
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,925
我怎么说？我扮妻子很出色
What can I say? I give good wife.

534
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,131
来
Come on.

535
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,094
你心内的确相信
Deep down, did you really believe

536
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,552
像我的这类人会下嫁这类人
someone like me
would marry someone like you,

537
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,103
住在这个鬼地方吗？
live in this shithole?

538
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,563
若我不是这个我，那么我是谁？
If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?

539
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,228
我怎知道？
How would I know?

540
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,486
我只是在这里执行职务
I just work here.

541
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,280
推测吧
Speculate.

542
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,150
若要我猜
If I had to guess,

543
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,827
因为高克根要用尽方法将你藏起来
不让反动份子发现你
all the trouble Cohaagen's taken
to hide you from the Resistance,

544
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,076
你一定是颇重要的
you must be fairly important.

545
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,663
加上你的技艺
我想你绝不可能是他的园丁
And with your skill set, I think it's highly
doubtful you're his gardener.

546
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,461
高克…
Cohaa...

547
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,794
高克根要将我藏起来
Cohaagen's trying to hide me?

548
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,633
为什么你想杀我？
Why are you trying to kill me?

549
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,969
说呀！
Talk!

550
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,260
杜格，就当是七年之痒吧
Call it seven-year itch, Doug.

551
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:34,185
况且你根本没有看见我想杀你！
And by the way, you haven't even
begun to see me try to kill you!

552
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,117
不！
No!

553
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,044
该死
Shit.

554
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,465
第三组，出动
Team three, break position.

555
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,838
我需要你到现场
I need you on-site now.

556
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,557
火车27，明白
Glide two seven, understood.

557
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,898
该死
Shit.

558
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,453
行动！
Move!

559
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,247
该死
Shit.

560
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,963
我想将他的电话再次连网
I want his phone back on the grid now.

561
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,631
唏
Hey!

562
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,583
行动！
Move!

563
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,667
喂
Hello?
Hello.

564
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,039
我是夏文
It's Hammond.

565
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,119
我不认识叫夏文的人
I don't know any Hammond.

566
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,203
该死
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

567
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,421
你说过这情况可能会发生
You said this might happen.

568
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,920
去找一块玻璃
Look, find a piece of glass.

569
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,547
找到了把手放上去
Put your hand to it.

570
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,969
马上去
Do it now.

571
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,858
哦，天呐
Oh, Jesus.

572
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,640
他们真的对你进行了大工程
They really did a number on you, didn't they?

573
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,850
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

574
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,602
你真的什么都记不起吗？
You honestly don't remember
any of it, do you?

575
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,146
记不起
No. No, I don't.

576
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,480
记起什么？你怎么会认识我？
Remember what? How do you know me?

577
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,736
我们以前一起当联邦国际刑警
We worked at federal intel together.

578
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,152
我们时间无多
Look, there isn't much time.

579
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,237
你对我说过若你再次出现在网络上
You said to me
that if you ever pop back on the grid,

580
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,454
我便得挂这个电话号码
I was to phone this number.

581
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,826
网络？
The grid?

582
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,408
你的电话
Your phone.

583
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,368
被重新启动
It's been reactivated.

584
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,920
你以为他们是怎样追踪你的？
How do you think
they've been tracking you?

585
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,543
你叫过我给你传讯息
Look, you asked me to give you a message,

586
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,716
所以我现在传给你
去拿锁匙
so I'm giving it to you. Get the key.

587
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,880
锁匙？什么锁匙？
The key? What is the key?

588
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,178
你说过你会知道
You said you'd know.

589
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,300
我不知！告诉我那是什么
Yeah, well, I don't! So tell me what it is.

590
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,849
我知道我们以前很熟落
Look, I know we were close,

591
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,517
但情况太危险了
but this is getting too dangerous.

592
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,560
若他们知道我跟你联络过，我会…
If they find out I've contacted you, I'll be...

593
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,811
只请…只请告诉我发生什么事
Just... Just tell me what's going on.

594
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,186
好吧，你想我是谁？
All right, who is it you think I am?

595
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,101
夏里
Henry.

596
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,737
夏里，好的，什么夏里？
Henry, okay, good. Henry, who?

597
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,693
时间无多了
Look, there isn't any time.

598
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,820
若我是你，我会扔掉那电话
If I were you, I'd get rid of that phone.

599
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,822
- 好吧？现在
- 我如何可以扔掉那电话？
- All right? Now.
- How can I get rid of the phone?

600
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,244
它在我的手里，我如何…
It's in my goddamn hand. How am I...

601
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,662
唏，等等
Hey, wait.

602
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,918
一个新讯息

603
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,920
第一银行
保险箱10549

604
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,502
10549 , 10549
10549. 10549.

605
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,857
来
Come on.

606
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,166
该死
Holy shit.

607
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,373
怎么了？
What is that?

608
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,503
我可以怎样弄来一个？
Where can I get one?

609
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,261
- 怎么了？
- 来
- What the hell?
- Yo, come on.

610
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,187
辨明追踪者

611
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,944
唏，机械怪，那是我的！
Hey, Robo-dick, that's mine!

612
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,155
有地方要去吗？没有？
Going somewhere? No?

613
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,830
那么别让它妨碍你
Well, don't let that stop you.

614
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,705
那幻想还是永远无法成真吗？
That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?

615
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,002
不再无法成真了
Not anymore.

616
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,753
利高公司为你提供
整套唯你独有的记忆
At Rekall, we'll provide you with
a complete set of memories all your own.

617
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,509
利高公司
Rekall.

618
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,171
我们为你记事
We can remember it for you.

619
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,302
进来！我们为你们准备了热的食物
Come inside! We have hot food for you.

620
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,106
葛特一定知道我们一直在跟踪他
Quaid must've known we'd be tracking it.

621
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,061
他到底怎么会知道的？
How the hell would he have known that?

622
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,155
该死
Oh, shit.

623
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,790
他令你像呆子
He made you look like a fool.

624
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,663
长官，他接受过密集追踪训练
He'd had major tactical training, sir.

625
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,834
你们没有告诉我
I wasn't made aware of that.

626
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,292
他怎么会发现的？
How the hell did he get activated?

627
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,417
一名执行此任务的特工告诉我
他到过利高公司
An agent in place
told me he'd gone to Rekall.

628
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,594
我派了一组人去
但他们下手前他的记忆已被毁
I sent a team in, but his memory implant
had been blown before they could get to him.

629
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,345
我比他迟了十五分钟
I'm 15 minutes behind him.

630
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,343
只是废止，明白吗？
Neutralize only, do you understand me?

631
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,053
别杀死他
No lethal force.

632
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,552
我要留活口再植入
I want him alive for re-implantation.

633
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,892
长官，他到底是谁？
Who the hell is this guy, sir?

634
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,650
别让人看见我的脸孔
Take me off display.

635
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,818
电话线安全
Line is secure.

636
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,995
你开我玩笑吗？
Are you fucking kidding me?

637
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,293
为何他还活着？
Why is he still alive?

638
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,083
长官，是
Yes, sir.

639
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,009
- 我们一见到他会马上杀掉
- 但大臣先生说…
- We kill him on sight.
- But the Chancellor said...

640
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,889
对不起，你说什么？
I'm SOFTY, say again?

641
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,221
- 对不起
- 大臣先生不在
- Sorry.
- The Chancellor's not here

642
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,806
此现实世界
on the ground.

643
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,684
相信我，若那目标有半个机会
他也会干掉我们
Believe me, if that target's given
even half a chance, he will end us.

644
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,861
若你见到他，你要杀掉他
If you see him, you shoot to kill.

645
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,438
- 明白吗？
- 走开好吗，混蛋？
- Is that understood?
- Will you lay off, asshole?

646
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,778
我一直告诉你那是我的电话
I keep telling you, that's my phone.

647
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,279
是那人给我的，我发誓
The guy gave it to me, I swear.

648
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,359
他去哪？
Where was he going?

649
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,612
谁？
Who?

650
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,038
给你电话的那人
The man that gave it to you.

651
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,832
小姐，我像有异能的人吗？
我怎么知道？
Lady, do I look like a psychic?
How the hell do I know?

652
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,253
我只能说这电话现在是我的财物
好了吗？
All I'm saying is that phone
is my personal property now, okay?

653
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,705
我晓得自己的权利，所以你们可以…
I know my rights, so you all can just...

654
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,215
唏
Hey!

655
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,046
你回气之后
When you've got your breath back,

656
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,139
要如实对我说出那男人对你说的一切
you're going to tell me everything

657
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,967
从头开始说起
that man said to you,
starting from the beginning.

658
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,719
你是谁？
Who are you?

659
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,437
他的太太
I'm his wife.

00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,614
好，你没事
Okay. You're good.

662
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,490
先生，我有什么可以效劳？
Can I help you, sir?

663
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,867
我在这里开了保险箱
Yeah, I have a safety-deposit box here.

664
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,871
编号是10549
It's 10549.

665
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,261
好的
Okay.

666
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,676
这边
This way, please.

667
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,820
签名对就可以了
Just need a signature match.

668
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,190
- 签名对？
- 账户的
- Signature match?
- For the account.

669
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,536
有问题吗？利特先生
Is there a problem, Mr. Reed?

670
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,376
不，没问题
No. No problem.

671
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,677
你用任何一个客户室都可以
You can use any one of these client rooms.

672
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,224
我就在外面
需要我的话随时叫我
And I'll just be outside, if you need me.

673
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,518
谢谢
Thanks.

好
Okay.

679
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,812
他们随时会来捉我
They're gonna be
coming for me any second,

680
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,568
所以我要快点

Okay, you're going to
find this hard to believe,

但你不是你以为自己是的那个人

If you're watching this,
it means I failed to escape.

686
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,836
即是他们成功给你
It means, it means they
succeeded in giving you

687
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,551
新的名字和身份
a new name, a new identity

688

it's not real.

691
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,010
你要相信我

若你是我
My only hope is, if you are me,

已经通知外面各个单位戒备
We've alerted all units outside.

729
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,504
为何他带着武器也可以通过扫描器？
How the hell did he get
a weapon past the scanner?

730

真无法相信是你

你认得我吗？

742
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,829
不知道
I don't know.

743
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,538
等等
Wait.

744
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,869
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

745
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,998
我到处找你
I have been looking for you everywhere.

746
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,796
突然你在所有警方扫描器中出现
Suddenly, you show up
on all the police scanners.

747
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,039
该死
Oh, shit.

748
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,924
等等
Hold on.

749
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,303
你真的记不起我吗？
You really don't remember me?

750
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,344
记不起
No.

751
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,855
我以前见过你，但…
I've seen you before, but it's...

752
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,182
不要紧
It's okay.

753
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,817
不要紧，我会向你说明一切
It's okay. I can explain everything.

754
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,607

on the suspect traveling north
on Interstate 19.

756

谁？
Who?

759
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,756
我太太
It's my wife.

760
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,543
你已婚吗？
You're married?

761
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,377
应该说我们已分开了
It's safe to say we're separated.

762
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,013
你来开车！
Here, you drive!

763
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,766
疑人已朝第三吊层走
Suspect is headed to suspension level three.

764
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,146
重覆，他已朝第三吊层走
Repeat, he has headed to suspension three.

765
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,930
AV-81，他朝东向威灵顿去了
AV-81,
he's headed eastbound on Wellington.

766
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,722
我要你在他到达之前先到达
收到吗？
I want you there before he is, do you copy?

767
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,515
收到，905
Copy that, 905.

768
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,935
所有车辆和空援请往威灵顿

769
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,189
在217区组成路障
Establish a barricade in zone 217.

770
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,950
中央要各单位留在防御区

to maintain their perimeter.

771
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,747
将他迫入路障
Drive him into that barricade.

772
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,203
不得给他留下逃走时空
Do not allow him any room for evasion.

773
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,287
清楚吗？
Is that clear?

774
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,497
收到，905
Copy that, 905.

775
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,799
所有车辆准备就绪
All vehicles, hold position.

776
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,467
该死
Oh, shit.

777
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,128
该死
Shit.

778
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,212
警告，车辆行驶时
Warning, mag suspension cannot be

779
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,297
磁锁故障！

无法停止磁力行驶
disengaged while vehicle is in operation.

781
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,017
你到底在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

782
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,720
你要配上安全带！
You're gonna need your seat belt on!

00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,653

车上有锁

788
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,783
你获授权作战

789
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,318
- 明白吗 ？
- 不明白！

791
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,123

795
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,575
身份确认：核准

796
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,107
锁匙，锁匙，锁匙
The key, the key, the key.

797
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,400
我录此讯息
This message is being recorded

798
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,073
是为了安全计
in the event of a worst-case scenario.

799
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,535
你肯定很想知道答案
所以我会从头说起
I'm sure you're desperate for answers,
so I 'll just start from the top.

800
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,405
我的姓名是…
My name...

801
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:40,413
你的姓名是加路孝生
Your name is Carl Hauser.

802
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,081
该死
Oh, shit.

803
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,960
这个录音的互动功能有限
This recording has limited
interactive capabilities.

804
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,795
请重组问题
So, just try rephrasing the question.

805
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,219
你替麦费思工作
You work with Matthias.

806
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,053
是与不是
Yes and no.

807
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,144
但我从未见过那人
I've never actually met the man.

808
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,892
根本没有人见过他
Hardly anyone has.

809
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,020
我知这很复杂
Look, I know that this is complicated.

810
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,851
- 复杂？
- 但这是事实
- Complicated?
- But this is the truth.

811
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,446
我是联邦情报员
I am a Federal Intelligence operative

812
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,356
高克根直接给我下了一道命令
assigned by Cohaagen

813
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:12,445
就是潜入反动组织杀死麦费思
to infiltrate the Resistance
and assassinate Matthias.

814
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,613
可是
But instead,

815
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,375
我发现自己站错边
I discovered
I was fighting for the wrong side.

816
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,670
我遇上一个女子
<i>I met</i> a <i>woman</i>

817
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,293
她开敌了我的眼睛
She works with the Resistance.

818
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,420
她令我知道我应该为反动组织而战
And she showed me
that they were worth fighting for.

819
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,589
你是指那些恐怖份子
You mean the terrorists.

820
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,798
反动组织不是恐怖份子
Listen, the Resistance are not terrorists.

821
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,215
好的
All right.

822
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,219
麦费思的目标总是军事设施
Matthias' targets are always
military installations.

823
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,561
其他的一切
If there's anything else happening,

824
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,939
都是高克根搞出来
you can be sure it's Cohaagen himself.

825
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,773
相信我
Trust me, all right.

826
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,398
大臣和我相识已久
The Chancellor and I go way back.

827
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,938
打仗时他是我的指挥官
He was my commanding officer in the war.

828
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,406
我清楚知道他的能力
I know exactly what he is capable of.

829
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,904
为何他打自己人？我不明白
Why would he attack his own people?
I don't understand.

830
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:58,366
他还有什么藉口可以把
联邦机械警力增至三倍？
How else could he justify tripling
production of federal police synthetics?

831
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,169
他在建私人军队，准备侵略殖民地
He is building a private army
capable of invading The Colony.

832
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,912
想一下，好的
Think about it. All right.

833
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,876
殖民地哪种资源是英联没有的？
What is the one resource The Colony has
that United Britain doesn't?

834
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,715
- 空间
- 正是
- S pace.
- Exactly.

835
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,470
他愈来愈不够地方
He's run out of room.

836
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,224
但是即使是高克根本人都很难
But even Cohaagen himself
is gonna have a difficult time

837
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:20,099
推销这个强夺领土
和迫迁数十亿人的想法
selling the forced seizure
and mass displacement of billions.

838
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,102
所以他把麦费思塑造成敌人
So, he created an enemy in Matthias,

839
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,437
和建立一队军队来对付他
and he built an army to fight him.

840
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:29,563
但我们可以阻止他，你和我
And now it is up to me to stop him.
Up to you to stop him.

841
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,772
什么意思，我？
What do you mean, me?

842
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,903
机械警察靠生物机械脑干生存
The synthetics run on a bio-mech brainstem.

843
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,872
有个法子可以关掉所有机械警察
All right. Which means, it's possible
to shut 'em all down.

844
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,538
有个歼灭密码
All right, there's a kill code.

845
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,119
是又长又复杂的密码
It's a complex sequence,

846
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,458
但它存在我脑袋中和你脑袋中
but it's in my head, it's in your head.

847
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,048
对不起，再说一次
Sorry, come again.

848
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,877
我去过英联
I went back to U. F.B. territory

849
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,966
想取得密码
to try and retrieve the code,

850
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,883
我很清楚
如果高克根知道我变成什么
knowing full well that if Cohaagen
found out I'd turned,

851
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,726
他会消除我的记忆
he'd erase my memory.

852
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:04,143
但他不知道我把一个黑盒
But what he didn't know was that
I arranged to have a black box

853
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,516
植入了我脑袋中，你脑袋中
imbedded in my brain, in your brain.

854
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,893
它记录了我看见的一切
It recorded everything I saw.

855
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,354
所以你是说我脑袋里有个小夹万
So, you're saying
there's a little safe in my skull.

856
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,318
对
Yes.

857
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,074
所以我需要你
And that is why I need you.

858
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:19,116
世界需要你和反动组织重新联系
The world needs you,
to reconnect with the Resistance.

859
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,455
把密码送交麦费思
Deliver the code to Matthias,

860
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:26,128
让他关掉机械警察
及早阻止高克根
have him shut down the synthetics
and stop Cohaagen while there's still time.

861
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,000
未来全靠你…
The future hangs on what you...

862
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,168
全靠我们跟着怎样做
On what we do next.

863
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,591
老友，祝好运
Good luck, buddy.

864
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,227
你一定是开玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

865
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,180
这不可能发生
This can't be happening.

866
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,765
我真不该来这儿
Shouldn't have come here.

867
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,695
我知道
Yeah, I know.

868
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,239
我没有选择
I had no choice.

869
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,613
我知道这不容易明白
I know that this is a lot to take.

870
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,696
对，真不容易明白
Yeah, it's a lot to take.

871
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,201
我应该相信吗？
Yeah, I'm supposed to believe this?

872
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,575
那是事实
It's the truth.

873
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,290
孝生，我们一直在找你
Hauser, we have been looking for you.

874
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:09,583
别叫我…
Don't call me...

875
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,290
我叫杜格拉斯葛
我生于8月29日
My name is Doug Quaid.
I was born August 29th.

876
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,625
母亲养大我
All right, I was raised by my mother.

877
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,756
我十五岁生日前十天她因癌病逝世
She died of cancer ten days
before my 15th birthday.

878
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:16,802
我二十九岁跟女朋友结婚！
I married my girlfriend when I was 29!

879
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,721
你是生于4月29日的
You were born April 29th.

880
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,548
你由父亲养大
You were raised by your father,
not your mother.

881
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,476
你父亲在你十五岁前撞车身亡
He died before you were 15,
but in a car crash.

882
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:26,726
相信我，你从未结过婚
And believe me, you were
most definitely not married.

883
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,608
对不起，你知道么？
这些对我都没有意思
I'm sorry. You know what?
None of this makes any sense to me.

884
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,730
我是杜格拉斯葛，我只知道这些
I'm Doug Quaid, that's all I know.

885
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,611
你认识我
You recognized me.

886
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,154
从睡梦中
From a dream.

887
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,195
我从睡梦中认识你
I recognize you from a dream.

888
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,569
那不是梦
It wasn't a dream.

889
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,579
那是记忆
It was a memory.

890
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,914
你想你手上的疤是怎样得来的？
That scar on your hand,
how do you think you got it?

891
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:51,792
你知道吗？
Do you know?

892
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,250
是工伤
I got it at work.

893
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,317
我当时想帮你逃走
但太迟了
I was trying to help you escape,
but I was too late.

894
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,644
你拉着我的手
You grabbed onto me

895
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,697
有一颗子弹射穿你的手和我的手
and a bullet tore through
your hand and mine.

896
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,958
你一定记得一点的
You must remember something.

897
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,677
你和我，我们…
And you and I, we were...

898
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,218
是
Yeah.

899
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,480
我们要去，我们要去
We got to go. We got to go.

900
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,167
该死，来，来
Shit. Come on, come on.

901
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,755
杜格！
Doug!

902
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,546
哈利？
Harry?

903
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,597
哈利，你在这里干什么？
Harry, what are you doing here?

904
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,517
他们派我来找你
They sent me in for you.

905
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,182
来劝服你
To talk you down.

906
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,308
谁派你来？
Who sent you in?

907
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,605
杜格
Doug,

908
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,692
你不明白
我的意思不是他们派我来这儿
you don't get it.
I don't mean they sent me in here.

909
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,362
我是指他们派我进入你的脑袋
I mean, they sent me into your mind.

910
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,314
我要你听我说
I need you to listen to me.

911
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,446
你患了一种叫偏执分离精神病
You're suffering what's called
a paranoid dissociative break.

912
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,903
是化学幻想创伤引起的
Brought on by the trauma
of a chemical fantasy.

913
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:48,950
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

914
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,203
杜格，你不是真的在此
You're not really here, Doug.

915
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,077
你还在利高公司被绑在椅子上
You're still back at Rekall,
strapped to a chair.

916
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,662
这些全都不是真的
None of this is real.

917
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,872
还在利高公司？
Back at Rekall?

918
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,086
他在说谎
He's lying.

919
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,166
他在说谎！
He's lying!

920
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,135
慢一点
Just slow down.

921
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,211
哈利，你在说什么？
Harry, what are you talking about?

922
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,090
我们在酒吧时你令我担心
所以我跟踪你
When we were back at the bar,
you had me worried. So, I followed you.

923
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,972
我去到时已经太迟
And by the time I got here, it was too late.

924
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:11,844
你全无反应
You were unresponsive.

925
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:16,186
他们用化学方法将我渗入你的脑中
So they chemically
transfused me into your mind.

926
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,065
他们认为熟识的脸孔可以令你清醒
They thought a familiar face might
help, to try and bring you back

927
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,900
以免太迟
before it's too late

928
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,565
你会永远无法清醒
and you're trapped here forever.

929
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,402
别听他说，他们只是想套取
你脑中的资料
Do not listen to them. They're just trying
to recover what's in your head.

930
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,367
杜格，我保证
Doug, I assure you.

931
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,994
这不是你认识的哈利
This is not the Harry that you know.

932
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,949
想一下…
Think...

933
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,661
他的声音像他吗？
Does he even sound like himself?

934
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,377
他是安排来防止你出轨的
像你太太一样
He is a plant, just like your wife,
to keep you in line.

935
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,381
我的声音不像我，因为你不想我像
I don't sound like me, Doug,
because you don't want me to.

936
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,138
什么“我不想你像”？
What do you mean, "I don't want you to"?

937
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,591
你要知道
我只是哈利出的主意
You need to realize,
I'm merely the idea of Harry.

938
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,802
其他的都是你的想像
The rest is supplied
by your own imagination.

939
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,353
就算是我现在给你的解释也是
Even the explanation
I'm giving you right now.

940
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,640
全是你想出来的
It's really you. It's really you.

941
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,481
你的脑海选择那些字眼
Your mind is choosing the words.

942
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,697
因为我们在你的脑海里
Because that's where we are, Doug.
In your mind.

943
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:10,987
我们必须救你出去，否则太迟
We must get you out before it's too late,
and you're trapped here forever.

944
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,832
如果全部在我的脑海里
If this is all in my mind,

945
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,743
为什么你要穿防弹衣？
why are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

946
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,962
因为你替我穿上
Because you put it on me.

947
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,255
- 我替你穿上？
- 你看不见吗？
- I put it on you?
- Don't you see?

948
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,752
解释我怎样替你穿上？
Explain that to me, how do I put this on you?

949
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:23,924
他疯了
He's crazy.

950
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,798
你的一部份想保护我
Part of you wants to protect me.

951
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,179
以便我引导你恢复神智
To let me guide you back to consciousness

952
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,845
在你的精神病病入膏肓
before your psychosis
reaches such extreme levels

953
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,101
陷入永久昏迷前
that you slip into a permanent coma.

954
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,019
来说服你释放自己
To convince you to free yourself.

955
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,557
孝生…
Hauser...

956
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,981
我是真实的，他也是真实的
I am real. He is real.

957
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,820
他为高克根工作
He works for Cohaagen.

958
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,608
罗莉
Lori?

959
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:56,249
- 她在这里干什么？
- 杜格，她也在这里
- What's she doing here?
- She's here, too, Doug.

960
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,415
她在这里干什么
What's she doing here?

961
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,245
她在房里，在你身旁
She's in the room, beside you,

962
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,749
她正捉着你的手
holding your hand right now,

963
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,001
十分担心
worried sick.

964
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,798
你感觉到她的存在
It's her presence you're sensing.

965
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,968
她…她想杀我！
She's... She's trying to kill me!

966
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,089
- 不！
- 哈利！
- No.
- Harry!

967
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,421
杜格，那不是真的罗莉
Not the real Lori, Doug.

968
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,841
我告诉她利高公司发生什么事后
她立刻过来
As soon as I told her what was happening at
Rekall, she came straight over.

969
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,055
我要在她上班时打电话通知她
I had to call her at work.

970
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,181
杜格，她爱你的
She loves you, Doug.

971
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,145
哈利，罗莉在晚上不工作
Lori didn't work last night, Harry.

972
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,821
你说谎，你说谎
You're lying. You're lying.

973
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,114
你为何对我说谎？
Why are you lying to me?

974
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,862
只是因为你想我说谎
Only because you wanted me to.

975
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,618
你无法从幻想中自拔
You're clinging to the delusion.

976
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:34,862
他说谎！
He's lying!

977
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,451
哈利？
Harry?

978
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,705
哈利
Harry.

979
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,712
我可以向上帝发誓，放下枪
I swear to God, put it down.

980
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,340
哈利，你干什么？
Harry, what are you doing?

981
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,792
哈利，你干什么？
Harry, what are you doing?

982
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,218
这不是幻象！
This is not a delusion!

983
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,338
不是？
No?

984
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,217
好吧
Okay, fine.

985
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,513
告诉你
Tell you what.

986
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,775
这些证据还不足够吗？
Is that proof enough for you?

987
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,153
若是真的话我会那样做吗？
Would I have done that if this were for real?

988
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,827
看，我不害怕，杜格
You see, I'm not afraid, Doug.

989
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,201
你也不应害怕
You shouldn't be either.

990
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,672
说够废话了
告诉他真相
That's enough of this bullshit.
Now, you are gonna tell him the truth,

991
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,749
否则我杀了你
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

992
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,586
不要…不要
Don't... Don't.

993
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,587
孝生…
Hauser...

994
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,509
他想令你投降！
He's trying to manipulate you
into giving yourself up!

995
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,720
- 我们要离开这里
- 去哪？
- We got to get out of here.
- And go where?

996
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,852
杜格，你无法摆脱思想
There's no getting
out of your own head, Doug.

997
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,401
但若你让我帮你
你可以逃离这恶梦
But you can escape this nightmare
if you let me help you.

998
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,319
现在帮我吗？
Help me how?

999
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,280
- 别听他说
- 你怎样可以帮我？
- Don't listen to him.
- How can you help me?

1000
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,444
别听他说
Don't listen to him.

1001
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,110
杜格，你要向她开枪
You have to shoot her, Doug.

1002
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,072
什么？
What, now?

1003
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,789
我知这令你为难
I know that's asking a lot,

1004
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:05,457
但她是你的
but she's at the epicenter of this whole

1005
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,754
扭曲幻象的关键
twisted fantasy of yours.

1006
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:11,801
她代表你所有的失落和不快
She represents all your frustration,
all your unhappiness.

1007
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,253
- 孝生…
- 所以
- Hauser...
- Which is why

1008
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,837
我们杀她是不要紧的
it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.

1009
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,716
要选择重回现实的是你
It's you who has to choose reality.

1010
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,385
杜格，向她开枪吧，我答应你
You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you,

1011
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,937
你惊醒后会看见我在房中坐在你身边
you will gasp awake
and find me sitting in the room beside you.

1012
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,014
那个真实的我
The real me.

1013
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,271
- 不
- 你的老友，哈利
- No.
- Your old pal, Harry.

1014
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,350
看着我
Look at me.

1015
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,650
你一转头便看见你那
Turn, and you'll see your beautiful,

1016
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,026
漂亮的太太
loving wife.

1017
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,153
杜格，她想你回去
She wants you back, Doug.

1018
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,656
我们两人都想
We both do.

1019
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:39,824
杜格，对了
That's right, Doug.

1020
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,827
回来
Come on back.

1021
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,789
杜格，回来
Come on back, Doug.

1022
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,630
我不可以让他们带你走
I can't let them take you away.

1023
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,132
抱歉，很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1024
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,063
她当然无法办到
Of course she can't do it.

1025
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,269
她不是真实的
She's not real.

1026
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,364
现在你只需要向自己证明
Now you just need to prove it to yourself.

1027
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,649
杜格，干掉她
End her, Doug.

1028
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,026
干掉这恶梦
End this nightmare.

1029
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,121
向她开枪！
Shoot her!

1030
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,994
该死，杀死她！
Kill her, damn it!

1031
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,035
开枪！
Shoot!

1032
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,564
老天
Jesus Christ.

1033
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,650
哈利，该死
God damn it, Harry!

1034
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,288
- 你没事吧？
- 没事
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1035
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,824
来
Come on.

1036
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,256
宝贝，你还在吗？
You still out there, baby?

1037
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,224
还是我应该称呼你为孝生
Or I suppose I should be calling you Hauser.

1038
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,605
我想我成了笑柄
I guess the joke's on me.

1039
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,017
我真的以为你是失败者
I really thought you were a loser.

1040
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,190
原来我一直
跟最出色的特务一同生活
Turns out, I was living with
the greatest intelligence agent alive.

1041
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,864
高克根仍然想你回去
Cohaagen still wants you back, you know.

1042
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,786
我想他对你仍有信心
Guess he still has faith in you.

1043
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,116
你以前一直是他最重用的
But then you always were the favorite.

1044
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,995
但我知你是什么
But I know what you are.

1045
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,580
孝生，你是叛徒
You're a traitor, Hauser.

1046
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,631
叛徒都要受死！
And traitors get put to death!

1047
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,755
来，来
Come on, come on, come on.

1048
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,846
也许你想给你的小女友临别一吻
So you might want to give
your little girlfriend a kiss good-bye.

1049
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,470
只要她不介意你过去一直吻的是谁
Long as she doesn't mind
where those lips have been.

1050
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,194
对了，我要干掉这婆娘
Oh, that's it, I'm ending this bitch.

1051
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,821
糟糕，子弹用完了
Shit, I'm out.

1052
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,838
来!来！
Come on! Come on!

1053
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,086
去！
Go!

1054
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,136
等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1055
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,467
来
Come on.

1056
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:55,557
该死
Shit.

1057
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:56,938
去
Go!

1058

那里
There.

1059
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,579
该死
Oh, shit.

1060
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,257
来
Come on.

1061
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,177
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1062
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,276
跟着他
Track him.

1063
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,536
抓着我的臂！
Grab my arm!

1064
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,109
往下面的吗？
Is this going down?

1065
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,237
不？
No?

1066
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,239
D-14层
Level D-14.

1067
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,372
该死
Shit.

1068
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:10,962
来！来！
Come on. Come on.

1069
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,384
等等，等等
Wait, wait.

1070
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,555
去！
Go!

1071
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,339
你真在行
You really know how to pick 'em.

1072
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,593
来
Come on.

01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,294
没有人会疯得到这里来
no one would be crazy
enough to come out here.

1107
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,213
大家都远离封锁区域
Everyone stays out of the No Zone.

1108
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,837
明智
Makes sense.

1109
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,726
警告
警告

1110
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,566
唏唏
-Hey.
-Hey.

1111
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,741
差不多了
Almost there.

1112
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,331
你没事吧？
You Okay?

1113
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,002
没事，我…
Yeah, I'm...

1114
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,088
大家都好像认识我，但我
Everyone seems to know me, but me.

1115
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,962
真奇怪
It's strange.

1116
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:05,840
是
Yeah.

1117
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,384
我看得出他对这些人很重要
I can see he meant a lot to these guys.

1118
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,475
是
Yeah.

1119
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,689
他对我们帮忙很大
He gave us the upper hand.

1120
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:20,021
我们有些人可以看见他的最大优点
And some of us were really
able to see the best in him.

1121
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:22,606
如果最大的优点消失了那怎办？
What if the best is gone?

1122
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,074
对不起
I'm sorry.

1123
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,994
你知道孝生并非完美
Hauser wasn't perfect, you know.

1124
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,701
有时可能是混蛋
Could be a real asshole sometimes.

1125
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,080
你只不过想令我好过点
You're just trying to make me feel better.

1126
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:41,504
也许
Maybe.

1127
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,260
很有效
It's working.

1128
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:44,942
安全
Clear.

1129
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,791
他想单独见他
He wants to see him alone.

1130
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,306
别走太远
Don't go too far.

1131
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:17,638
好的
Okay.

1132
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:41,999
孝生先生
Mr. Hauser.

1133
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,552
你想怎样？
What is it you want?

1134
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,673
我想帮你
I want to help you.

1135
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,307
你不是为此而来的
That is not the only reason you're here.

1136
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:04,852
我想恢复记忆
I want to remember.

1137
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,612
为什么这样？
Why?

1138
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,691
我便可以做回从前的自己
So I can be myself, be who I was.

1139
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:16,030
每个人都想寻找真正的自己
It is each man's quest
to find out who he truly is,

1140
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,615
但答案是
but the answer to that lies

1141
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,122
在当下，不是在过去
in the present, not in the past.

1142
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,703
我们大家都是如此
As it is for all of us.

1143
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,460
但过去令我们知道今天变成了什么人
But the past tells us who we've become.

1144
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,792
过去的事构成人的思想
The past is a construct of the mind.

1145
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,298
令我们盲目
It blinds us.

1146
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,596
蒙蔽我们
It fools us into believing it.

1147
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,139
但内心
But the heart

1148
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:38,060
想活在当下
wants to live in the present.

1149
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,562
瞧
Look there.

1150
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,390
你会找到答案的
You'll find your answer.

1151
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,073
他们说你有资料可以拯救我们所有人
I am told you have information
that may save us all.

1152
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,569
别人也这样对我说
I am told the same.

1153
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,645
记忆库的防火墙
The firewall to the black box.

1154
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,775
进去
We're in.

1155
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:44,541
那儿
There.

1156
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:45,789
看见吗？
You see?

1157
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,041
天啊
Jesus.

1158
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,206
可以检索出来吗？
Can you retrieve it?

1159
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,918
加密了
It's encrypted.

1160
01:29:58,268 --> 01:29:59,474
这是什么？
What is this?

1161
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,439
麦费思，你好
Hello, Matthias.

1162
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,656
你不能想像
You can't imagine how much

1163
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,655
我多渴望再见到你
<i>I've been looking forward
to seeing you again.</i>

1164
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,494
阔别太久了
It's been far too long.

1165
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,369
你真难找
You know, you're a very hard man to find.

1166
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,667
- 是陷阱
- 全部关掉！
- It's a trap.
- Shut it all down!

1167
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,253
守着所有入口！
Secure all entrances!

1168
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,835
走！走！
Move! Move!

1169
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,050
去！去！
Go, go, go!

1170
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,695
带他走！
Get him out of here!

1171
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,209
马上放下枪！
Gun down now!

1172
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:11,958
马上！
Now!

1173
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,074
干得好
Well done.

1174
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,074
真出色
It's impressive.

1175
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,750
你一定有兴趣知道根本没有
You'll be interested to know that

1176
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,790
根本没有歼灭密码
there is no kill code.

1177
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:53,746
是假的
It was a fake.

1178
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,082
你说谎
You're lying.

1179
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,758
对不起
Sorry.

1180
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,671
这是找到你的唯一方法
It was the only way to get to you.

1181
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:03,006
大费周章为找一个人
All this trouble for one man.

1182
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:06,426
切勿可氏估一个人的力量
Oh, never underestimate
the power of one man.

1183
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,432
我知我不会
I know I don't.

1184
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:12,728
爸爸
Father!

1185
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,443
不！不！
No! No!

1186
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:21,699
我们知道总会有这一天
We knew this day would come.

1187
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:24,902
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1188
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:38,833
不
No. Melina!

1189
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,055
- 中尉？
- 长官，全都在这里
- Lieutenant?
- It's all here, sir.

1190
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:46,724
麦费思的防卫计划
Matthias' defensive plans,

1191
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,268
反对组织在殖民地每个哨站的
troop numbers and location coordinates

1192
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:52,097
军队数目和位置座标
on every Resistance outpost in The Colony.

1193
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,808
第一波袭击已经展开
The first wave of attack is already underway.

1194
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,737
好极
Brilliant.

1195
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,907
恭喜，我的朋友
请让他起来
Congratulations, my friend.
Get him up, please.

1196
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,155
起来，起来
Up, up, Up.

1197
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:07,320
你办到了
YOU did it.

1198
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:12,579
你是英雄
You're a hero.

1199
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,085
你在说什么？
What is that? Modesty? No, no, no.

1200
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,549
麦费思死了
Matthias is dead,

1201
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:21,752
殖民地快要瓦解
The Colony is about to fall,

1202
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,336
都是多得你
and it's all thanks to you.

1203
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,632
我就是知道可以信任你依计行事
I knew that I could trust you
to stick to the plan.

1204
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,349
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1205
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:32,641
对，你的记忆不是最可靠
Right. Yours is not
the most reliable of memories, is it?

1206
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,016
它很简单
It was really rather simple.

1207
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:41,108
渗透反动力量，找麦费思女儿
Infiltrate the resistance,
find Matthias' daughter.

1208
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,485
- 不
- 使她信任你，是
- No. No.
- Get her to trust you. Yes.

1209
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,652
对
That's right.

1210
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,872
我们一旦发现他是你爸爸
Once we discovered he was your father,

1211
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,707
便知道目标是谁
we knew exactly who to target.

1212
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,243
马莲娜，他撒谎
Melina, he's lying.

1213
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,417
恐怕不是，这也是容易的
I'm afraid not.
You see, that was also the easy part.

1214
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,584
因为他诱惑女仔是他的强项
Because seduction has always been
his strongest suit.

1215
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:07,472
但我们要找的始终是麦费思
Still, it was Matthias that we needed to get to.

1216
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,642
他需要更多的保证
He would need assurance
far beyond mere words

1217
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:16,556
才会让你这个有前科的人
to let a man with your history, shall I say,

1218
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,391
接近他
come anywhere near him.

1219
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:25,524
那时你想到这个聪明绝顶的方法
But that is when you came up
with the ingenious idea

1220
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:30,237
假装被捕和抹掉你的记忆
to feign capture
and let us wipe your slate clean.

1221
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:31,450
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

1222
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,872
真聪明
It was just brilliant.

1223
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,206
还有什么更好的方法
What better way

1224
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,545
来说服这老头子
to convince the old man that you

1225
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:48,050
你已经背叛我
had really and truly turned against me.

1226
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:50,507
马莲娜，别听他的
别听他的
Melina, don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him.

1227
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:54,477
- 他撒谎
- 不，我没有
- He's lying.
- No, I'm not.

1228
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:57,931
尽管有少许波折
Granted, there were a few hiccups

1229
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:00,353
例如中途…你闯入
along the way... You popping

1230
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,731
利高公司的记忆中枢
your cap at Rekall, for instance.

1231
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:04,528
这不太好
That wasn't good.

1232
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,440
就是了
There it is!

1233
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,281
昔日的孝生精神
正是你所需要的
The old Hauser spirit.
You're gonna need that.

1234
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,952
还有就是你美丽的妻子
And then there was your lovely wife,

1235
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,791
她不服从指令
who strayed from her directive.

1236
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,119
看着
Look at me.

1237
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,455
我们命令她将你活捉
She was ordered to bring you back alive.

1238
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:25,834
我迟些跟你算账
I'll deal with that later.

1239
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,971
但是
But,

1240
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:33,300
孝生，是你引领我们到此
you led us here, Hauser.

1241
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,723
你帮我们取得这个
You held up your part of the deal,

1242
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,223
因此
我会给你第二次机会
and now I'm going to hold up mine.

1243
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,814
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1244
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,567
- 不
- 你在干什么？
- No.
- What are you doing?

1245
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,649
你在…
What are you...

1246
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,031
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1247

01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,703
3号至87号海湾已经武装
随时可以行动

1388

让它们立刻行动

1389

孝生，你真令人失望

1390
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:24,750
我想现在是时候将记忆永久消除
I'm afraid it's time to erase
those memories for good.

1391
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,470
再见，老朋友

1392

- 武器系统重新装弹
- 该死，来
- Weapons systems reloading.
- Shit, come on.

1397
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:37,758
你真的认为那样可以
阻止整个侵略行动吗？
You really thought
that would stop an entire invasion?

1398
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,556
不，但这样可以

1399

看看你
Look at you.

1401

你还在战斗
You're still fighting

1402
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:42,993
但你根本不知自己是谁
and you don't even know who you are.

1403
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:45,996
我记不起自己以前是谁
I may not remember who I was,

1404
01:54:46,088 --> 01:54:48,124
但我知我现在是谁
but I know who I am.

1405
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:15,814
替我跟我太太说声好
Say hello to my wife for me.

1406
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,125
来！跑！

没事的
It'll be fine.

1411
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:47,765
唏，唏
Hey, hey.

1412
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:49,262
唏，醒来
Hey, wake up.

1413

Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1414
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:52,770
来
Come on.

1415
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,144

醒来
Wake up.

1420
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:31,134
把你的幻象告诉我们
Tell us your fantasy.

1421
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:32,935
我们会把记忆给你
We'll give you the memory.

1422
01:58:33,023 --> 01:58:34,729
别胡思乱想
Don't mess with your mind, man.

1423
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:35,896
不值得呢
It ain't worth it.

1424
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,224
秘密特务
Secret agent.

1425
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:38,604
那是你，对吗？
That's you. Right?

1426
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:48,238
嗨
Hi.

嗨
Hey.

1429

Are you okay?

01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,456
没事
Yeah.

1431

01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:48,545
你以为没有临别一吻
Did you think I'd let you leave

1438
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,301
我会让你走吗？
without a kiss good-bye?

1439
01:59:57,315 --> 01:59:59,522
“直至死亡把我们分开”
对吗？
"Till death do us part," right, baby?

1440
01:59:59,609 --> 02:00:00,564
充电

1441
02:00:00,652 --> 02:00:01,732

1447
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:52,325

Oh, my God.

1448
02:00:56,875 --> 02:00:58,206
谢谢你
Thank you.

1449
02:00:59,043 --> 02:01:02,627

as the invasion so many feared

1454
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,050
我们的历史揭开新的一页

1455
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:15,632
结束了长时间的经济和政治压迫

命运的消息
No word yet on the fate

我知
I know.

1461
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:35,781
真难以置信，是吗？
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

1462
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:55,130
喂，那是什么？
Hey, what is it?

1463
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:59,471
利高公司
