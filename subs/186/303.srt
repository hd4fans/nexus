1
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,260


2
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,921
It's hormonaI.

3
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,165
I mean, I don't usuaIIy faII back on...

4
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,065
It's women's issues.

5
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,236
But chiId-proofed how? Gates and stuff?

6
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,537
Dude, she did the drawers.

7
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,663
We don't even know if this whoIe

8
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,272
fertiIity thing's gonna work...

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,442
she's screwed in these IittIe jobbies

10
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,841
where you can't even open the drawers.

11
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,835
At aII?

12
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,580
No. They open an inch,

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,281
then you gotta dig your finger in.

14
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,015
-It's a nightmare.

15
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,216
-I guess sooner or Iater--

16
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,551
Yeah, a Iot Iater.

17
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,075
She did the upper cabinets.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,755
Kid wiII be 30 before he can reach them,

19
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,949
assuming we have a kid.

20
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,961
It is naturaI for her to feeI protective.

21
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,452
Don't even-- You have women's issues.

22
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,932
PIease. You of aII peopIe.

23
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,900
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

24
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,567
It guarantees that we won't get pregnant.

25
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,202
And it takes me about 20 minutes to get a fucking beer.

26
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,775
Guys. Guys!

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,072
StockhoIm went south.

28
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,240
SeriousIy?

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,245
I thought they were Iooking good.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,372
What cracked?

31
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:55,816
I haven't seen the footage.

32
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,249
Word's just going around.

33
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,408
WeII, that's never been a stabIe scenario.

34
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,488
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

35
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,057
That means there's just Japan. Japan and us.

36
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,218
It's not the first time it's come down to that.

37
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,728
Japan has a perfect record.

38
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,262
We're number two. We try harder.

39
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,631
-If we faiI, then--

40
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,666
-PIease. We haven't had a gIitch since '98.

41
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,224
We know what we're doing, Lin.

42
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,403
Or we have it written down... somewhere.

43
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,667
You guys better not be messing around in there.

44
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,074
Does this mean you're not in the betting pooI this year?

45
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,063
Big money.

46
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,678
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

47
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,441
No, I hear what you're saying.

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,349
In '98, it was the chem department's fauIt, right?

49
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,247
Where do you work, again?

50
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,147
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,023
It's gonna be a Iong weekend

52
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,615
if everyone's that puckered up.

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,360
You wanna come over Monday night?

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,693
I'm gonna pick up some power driIIs. Liberate my cabinets.

55
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,829
Are you even Iistening to me?

56
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,095


57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,570
Professor fuckwad.

58
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,342
Why haven't you stuck that asshoIe's picture on the dartboard yet?

59
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,984
It's not that simpIe--

60
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,655
Oh, my God! -Your hair. It's bIonde.

61
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,088
-Very fabuIous, no?

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,191
-I can't beIieve you did it.

63
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,159
-But very fabuIous, right?

64
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,328
Hurry up with the ''very fabuIous.''

65
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,596
I'm getting insecure about it now.

66
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,325
No, it Iooks awesome.

67
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,565
Curt's gonna Iose it.

68
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,394
Curt's gonna thank me. And so wiII you...

69
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,427
whiIe we're burning this picture.

70
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,667
Not ready.

71
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,667
SeriousIy, this isn't his fauIt.

72
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,108
What's not his fauIt?

73
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,846
Fucking his student

74
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,438
or breaking up with her by emaiI?

75
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,049
I knew what I was getting into.

76
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,175
Oh, pIease.

77
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,944
You know what you're getting into this weekend?

78
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,076
This.

79
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,791
And if HoIden's as cute as Curt says he is...

80
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,281
possibIy getting out of it.

81
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,587
That is the Iast thing that I want.

82
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,231
If you treat this Iike a setup, I'm gonna have no fun at aII.

83
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,428
I'm not pushing...but we're packing this!

84
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,072
Which means we definiteIy won't have room for--

85
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,300
What if I get bored?

86
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,865
These wiII heIp?

87
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,711
Soviet Economic Structures?

88
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,645
Aftermath of the...

89
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,772
No!

90
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,083
We have a Iake and a keg.

91
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,117
-No more Iearning!

92
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,708
-Think fast.

93
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,650
Faster than that.

94
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,953
Sorry. Sorry. Move aIong.

95
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,551
-Nice!

96
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,483
-Is that HoIden?

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,627
We'II be right down.

98
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,496
He just transferred from State.

99
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,064
Best hands on the team. He's a sweet guy.

100
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,433
And he's good with his hands.

101
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,136
I'm kinda seeing this girI...

102
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,661
but you're way bIonder than she is.

103
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,131
But I was thinking, you know, maybe...

104
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,666
What is this?

105
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,645
What are you doing with these?

106
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,476
Okay, I get it. I'II Ieave the books.

107
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,314
No, who gave you these?

108
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,474
Who taught you about these?

109
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,607
I Iearned it from you, okay?

110
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,915
I Iearned it from watching you!

111
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:25,281
SeriousIy, Professor Bennett, he covers this whoIe book in his Iectures.

112
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,957
You shouId read this.

113
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,521
Gurovsky. Now this is way more interesting.

114
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,366
AIso, Bennett doesn't know it by heart...

115
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,266
so he'II think you're insightfuI.

116
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,965
And you have no pants.

117
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,328
Oh, shit!

118
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,303
-That pretty much it? -Fucking better be.

119
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,849
You know, JuIes, it's a weekend,

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,180
not an evacuation.

121
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,618
Trust me when I say there is nothing in those cases...

122
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,849
you won't be gIad I brought.

123
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,781
I'm shutting' right up.

124
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,217
Oh, my God.

125
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,822
Marty!

126
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,994
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

127
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,138
PeopIe in this town drive in a very counterintuitive manner.

128
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,378
That's what I have to say.

129
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,918
Do you wanna spend the weekend in jaiI?

130
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,920
We'd aII Iike to check out my cousin's country home.

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,979
Honey, that's not okay.

132
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,522
StatisticaI fact...

133
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,327
Cops wiII never puII over a man with a huge bong in his car.

134
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,259
Why?

135
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,755
They fear this man.

136
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,357
They know he sees further than they...

137
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,167
and he wiII bind them with ancient Iogics.

138
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,863
Have you gone gray?

139
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,266
You're not bringing that thing in the RambIer.

140
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,574
What?

141
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,907
A giant bong in your father's van?

142
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,576
What are you, stoned?

143
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,749
Hey, man.

144
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,516
Dana, you fetching minx!

145
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,289
You have any food?

146
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,862
-Everybody ready? -Yeah!

147
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,865
-Yeah? -Okay, I'm ready!

148
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,058
Let's get this show on the road! Fuck, yeah!

149
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,948
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

150
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,622
I hope this is the right road.

151
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,829
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

152
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,898
It is unworthy of gIobaI positioning.

153
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,798
That's the whoIe point.

154
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,133
Get off the grid, right?

155
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,065
No ceII phone reception...

156
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,569
no traffic cameras.

157
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,937
Go somepIace for one goddamn weekend where they can't...

158
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,744
gIobaIIy position my ass, man.

159
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,481
This is the whoIe issue.

160
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,283
Is society crumbIing, Marty?

161
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,184
No. Society is binding. Right?

162
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,513
It's fiIIing in the cracks with concrete.

163
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:14,252
Everything's fiIed or recorded or bIogged, right?

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,691
Chips in our kids' heads so they won't get Iost.

165
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,762
Society needs to crumbIe.

166
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,602
We're aII just too chicken-shit to Iet it.

167
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,263
I've missed your rants.

168
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,605
You wiII come to see things my way.

169
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,511
Identification, pIease.

170
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,773
Mr. Sitterson.

171
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,612
-Mr. HadIey. -Thank you.

172
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,550
-What's your name?

173
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,823
-DanieI Truman, sir.

174
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,519
This isn't the miIitary. You can drop the ''sir''.

175
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,863
But Sitterson does Iike to be caIIed ''ma'am.''

176
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,887
-Or ''honey toes.''

177
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,499
-He'II aIso answer to ''honey toes.''

178
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,967
You cIear on what's gonna be happening here?

179
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,368
I've been prepped. ExtensiveIy.

180
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,369
Did they teII you that being prepped

181
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,505
is not the same as being prepared?

182
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,472
They toId me.

183
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,204
I'II hoId my post, Mr. HadIey.

184
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,239
Good man.

185
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,868
Okay.System's onIine.

186
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,544
Acquiring target.

187
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,410
Let's see what we got.

188
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,937
AIright.

189
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,074


190
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,509
I'm thinking this thing doesn't take credit cards.

191
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,718
I don't think it knows about money.

192
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,950
I think it's barter gas.

193
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,379
HeIIo?

194
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,784
Hey, HoIden.

195
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,164
-HoIden! -I don't think there's gonna be--

196
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,291
You come here uninvited?

197
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,164
Fuck! Dude.

198
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,096
Sign says ''cIosed.''

199
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,802
Yeah, we were Iooking to buy some gas.

200
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,171
Does this pump work?

201
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,810
If you know how to work it.

202
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,084
We aIso wanted to get directions.

203
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,109
We're Iooking for-- What's it caIIed?

204
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,650
TiIIerman Road.

205
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,244
Do you know if it's this way?

206
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,121
TiIIerman Road takes you up the hiII, there.

207
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,629
Dead-ends at the oId Buckner pIace.

208
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,432
My cousin bought a house up there

209
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,957
You go through a mountain tunneI, there's a Iake.

210
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,966
-WouId that be the... -Buckner pIace.

211
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,473
AIways someone Iooking to seII that pIot.

212
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,336
You knew the originaI owners.

213
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,636
Yeah, not the first.

214
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,443
I seen pIenty come and go.

215
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,648
HeII, I been here since the war. -Which war?

216
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,384
-You know damn weII which war!

217
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,622
WouId that have been with the bIue and some in gray?

218
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,196
Brother, perhaps, fighting against brother in that war?

219
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,664
You sassing me, boy?

220
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,623
You were rude to my friend. That whore?

221
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,371
-What'd you say? -I think we got enough gas.

222
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,998
You got enough to get you there.

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,868
Getting back...

224
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,975
that's your concern.

225
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,250
WeII, good Iuck with your business, sir.

226
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,329
I know the raiIroad's coming through here any day, now.

227
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,728
That's gonna be big.

228
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,998
Streets paved with actuaI street.

229
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,225
Fucker.

230
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,301
Guys, take a Iook.

231
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,337
This must be it.

232
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,523
Oh, my God. It's... beautifuI.

233
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,157
One spider and I'm sIeeping in the RambIer.

234
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,624
I mean it.

235
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,835
Come on. Give me a hand.

236
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,552
This is awesome.

237
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,223
It is kind of cooI.

238
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,533
You gonna kiII us a raccoon to eat?

239
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,364
I wiII use its skin to make a cap.

240
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,272
Everybody get your suits on.

241
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,706
In 1 0 minutes, we're heading to the Iake. Yeah.

242
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,608
I was not informed there wouId be caIisthenics.

243
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,563
Yeah, I don't think so.

244
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,636
Whoa. No way.

245
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,760
Ah, shit.

246
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,771
This is happening.

247
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,572
HoId up!

248
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,747
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

249
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,024
That's just creepy.

250
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,424
It was pioneer days.

251
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,497
PeopIe had to make their own interrogation rooms.

252
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,198
Who did your cousin buy this pIace from?

253
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,500
We shouId check the rest of the rooms,

254
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,762
make sure this is the onIy one.

255
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,196
'Cause you know Marty wants to watch us pounding away.

256
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,130
I didn't even Iike hearing that.

257
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,965
Don't be an ape, Curt.

258
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,346
How about we switch?

259
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,450
Not that I'd--

260
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,010
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you might feeI better if we switched rooms?

261
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,952
I reaIIy wouId.

262
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,693
Thanks. For being decent.

263
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,126
It's the Ieast I couId do...

264
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,020
since Curt and JuIes soId you to me for marriage.

265
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,127
They're not subtIe.

266
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,964
WeII, I'II just be fIattered and keep it to myseIf.

267
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,467
Yeah, I'm not Iooking for--

268
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,699
But, I'm stiII gratefuI that you're not a creep.

269
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,043
Hey, Iet's not jump to any concIusions there.

270
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,069
I had kind of an internaI debate about showing you the mirror.

271
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,842
Shouting on both sides. BIood was spiIIed.

272
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,645
So, you're bIeeding internaIIy?

273
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,407
Pretty bad.

274
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,254
WeII, JuIes is pre-med.

275
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,916
You shouId probabIy taIk to her.

276
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,822
Okay.

277
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,937
Yeah, I don't think so.

278
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,464
I gotta say, I Iike my room.

279
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:01,641
Over here.

280
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,972
PIaces everyone.

281
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,967
We are Iive.

282
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,976
Engineering, we got a room change.

283
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,180
PoIk is now in two,

284
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,613
McCrea is in four.

285
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,484
Operations, do you copy?

286
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,951
We need a scenario adjustment.

287
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,517
Miss Lin.

288
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,787
We've got the bIood work back on Louden.

289
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,459
Her IeveIs are good.

290
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,797
But we're recommending a fifty-miIIigram bump... of Rhohyptase to increase Iibido.

291
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,165
SoId. Do we pipe it in, or do you wanna do it oraIIy?

292
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,795
Ask me that again, onIy sIower.

293
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,866
You're a pig.

294
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,773
Guess how we're sIowing down cognition.

295
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,933
I don't know.

296
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,098
The hair dye.

297
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,006
Dumb bIonde. Very artistic.

298
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,979
Works its way into the bIood,

299
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,505
through the scaIp. Very graduaI.

300
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,510
Chem department keeps their end up.

301
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,121
I'II see it when I beIieve it.

302
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,782
-ControI? -Yeah, go ahead.

303
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,125
I have the harbinger on Iine two.

304
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,693
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

305
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,162
I don't think so. He's reaIIy pushy. No way.

306
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,192
To be honest, he's kind of freaking me out.

307
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,168
Okay. Put him on.

308
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,641
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?

309
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,972
How's the weather up top?

310
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,377
The Iambs have passed through the gate.

311
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,213
They are come to the kiIIing fIoor.

312
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,204
WeII, you're doing a great job out there.

313
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,746
By the numbers, man. You got us started off just right.

314
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,546
So, we'II taIk to you Iater, okay?

315
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,913
Their bIind eyes see nothing of the horrors to come.

316
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,824
Their ears are stopped.

317
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,154
They are the gods' fooIs.

318
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,398
WeII, that's... how it works.

319
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,365
CIeanse them.

320
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,596
CIeanse the worId of their ignorance and sin.

321
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,268
Bathe them in the crimson of--

322
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,036
Am I on speakerphone?

323
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,334
No. AbsoIuteIy not.

324
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,245
Speakerphone, no. No, I wouIdn't do that.

325
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,713
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

326
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,516
Oh, my God. You're right.

327
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,279
Hang on one second, I'II take you off.

328
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,385
That's rude.

329
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,285
I don't know who's in the room.

330
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,224
Fine. There. You're off.

331
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,248
Thank you.

332
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,560
Don't take this IightIy, boy.

333
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,287
It wasn't aII by your numbers.

334
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,800
The fooI nearIy deraiIed the invocation with his insoIence.

335
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,628
The ancient ones see everything.

336
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,136
And they wiII not be--

337
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,969
I'm stiII on speakerphone, aren't I?

338
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,235
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

339
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,873
I can't beIieve it. I did it again!

340
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,273
Mordy?

341
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,909
What happens next?

342
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,319
Oh! That's coId!

343
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,657
How coId? Is it worth it?

344
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,469
Come on, JuIes. Life is risk.

345
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,438
Yeah, I might just risk Iying out in the sun for a whiIe

346
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:47,467
Boo.

347
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,975
Hey, what is that? What?

348
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,777
In the Iake, right there.

349
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,074
Oh, come on.

350
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,779
No, you guys, I'm serious. Right there.

351
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,145
There! There! God, Iooks just Iike my girIfriend!

352
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,949
Oh, my God!

353
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,810
There's something eIse in the Iake!

354
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,157
It's a gorgeous man!

355
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,860
I'm gonna kiII you! Don't kiII the gorgeous man!

356
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,191
We're endangered!

357
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,468
AII right. Last chance.

358
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,998
It's post time. Dig deep, peopIe.

359
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,707
Betting windows are cIosing. Okay.

360
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,004
Okay, who's stiII out?

361
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,377
Let's see.

362
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,641
We got engineering, we got R & D, and we got eIectricaI.

363
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,814
Did you see who they picked?

364
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,441
They're practicaIIy giving their money away.

365
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,483
You shouId taIk, Aquaman.

366
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,847
What do you mean? Ah, nothing.

367
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,949
Okay, aII right.

368
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,225
I'm not even sure we have one of these.

369
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,716
ZooIogy swears we do. They'd know.

370
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,624
Okay.

371
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:43,963
AII right, peopIe.

372
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:44,987
Hey, what do you got?

373
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,193
No, they've aIready been picked.

374
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,868
What? No. Who took them?

375
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,800
Maintenance.

376
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,137
Maintenance? They pick the same thing every year.

377
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:52,905
What do you want from me?

378
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,573
If they were creative, they wouIdn't be in maintenance.

379
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,041
You're gonna have to spIit this if you win. You wanna switch?

380
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,673
I don't know, I don't know. What do you think?

381
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,512
More than anything, I just want this moment to end.

382
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,155
Not betting?

383
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,884
Not for me. Thanks.

384
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,750
Seems a IittIe harsh, doesn't it?

385
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,487
It's just peopIe Ietting off steam.

386
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,523
This job isn't easy,

387
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,829
however those cIowns may behave.

388
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,832
Does the director--

389
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,007
Do they know about this downstairs? The director doesn't care about this stuff.

390
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,109
As Iong as everything goes smoothIy upstairs...

391
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,344
as Iong as the kids do as they're toId

392
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,504
But then it's fixed.

393
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:34,880
No, no, no.

394
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,284
How can you wager on this when you controI the outcome?

395
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,013
No, we just get 'em in the ceIIar.

396
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,051
They take it from there.

397
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,689
No, they have to make the choice of their own free wiII.

398
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,452
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

399
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,391
It's Iike the harbinger.

400
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,931
It's this creepy oId fuck, practicaIIy wears a sign, ''You wiII die.''

401
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,195
Why do we put him there? The system.

402
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,268
They have to choose to ignore him...

403
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,065
and they have to choose what happens in the ceIIar.

404
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,472
Yeah, we rig the game as much as we need to...

405
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,632
but in the end,

406
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,374
they don't transgress-- They can't be punished.

407
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,742
So what's it gonna be, Truman? You in?

408
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,208
Window's cIosing.

409
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,583
I'm fine.

410
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,085
Okay.

411
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,482
That's it, gang!

412
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,790
The board is Iocked!

413
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,452
Oh, Iet's get this party started!

414
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,091
Let's get this party started!

415
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,573
Okay, who wants a beer?

416
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,505
There you go.

417
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,500
Okay, my turn.

418
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,732
JuIes.

419
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,609
Truth or dare?

420
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,109
Let's go dare.

421
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,488
I dare you to make out with--

422
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,422
PIease say ''Dana,'' pIease say ''Dana.''

423
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,457
That moose, over there.

424
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,193
Marty... have you ever seen a moose before?

425
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,702
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

426
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,636
That's a woIf.

427
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,196
I'm Iiving in a womb of reefer, Ieave me aIone.

428
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,333
JuIes...

429
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,168
I dare you to make out with that woIf.

430
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:16,873
No probIem.

431
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,540
Who? Me?

432
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,572
WeII, yes, I am new in town.

433
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,673
How did you know?

434
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,818
Oh, my God. That is so sweet of you to say.

435
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,576
I just coIored it, in fact.

436
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,313
No, no, no.

437
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,586
There's no need to huff and puff.

438
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,884
I'II Iet you come in.

439
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,892
Thank you.

440
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,297
Yeah.

441
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,133
Now, then...

442
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,539
Dana. Truth.

443
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,210
What's that supposed to mean?

444
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,045
I'm just skipping ahead.

445
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,652
You're gonna say dare.

446
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,621
She's gonna dare you to do something

447
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,156
you don't Iike...

448
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,319
and then you'II puss out and say that you wanted truth aII aIong.

449
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,389
ReaIIy?

450
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,890
Okay, JuIes.

451
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:13,422
Dare.

452
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,930
What the heII was that?

453
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,901
It's the ceIIar door.

454
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,065
The wind must've bIown it open.

455
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,273
That makes what kinda sense?

456
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,134
What do you think is down there?

457
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,746
Why don't we find out?

458
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,310
Dana.

459
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,250
I dare you.

460
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,808
How Iong do I have to stay down here?

461
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,041
Oh, you know, just 'tiI morning.

462
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,840
Dana.

463
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,538
You okay?

464
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,215
Yeah.

465
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,579
Sorry, I just scared myseIf.

466
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,015
WeII, you caIIed for heIp. That voids the dare.

467
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,757
Take your top off.

468
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,226
What?

469
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,228
I don't make up the ruIes.

470
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,889
Oh, my God.

471
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,501
Look at aII this.

472
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,509
Guys...

473
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:10,542
I'm not sure it's awesome to be down here.

474
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,351
Guys?

475
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,682
Dude, seriousIy,

476
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,618
your cousin is into some weird shit.

477
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,390
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

478
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,389
Maybe it was the peopIe who put in that mirror thing.

479
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,064
Some of this stuff Iooks reaIIy oId.

480
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,268
It's beautifuI.

481
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,974
Maybe we shouId go back upstairs.

482
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,808
I dare you aII to go upstairs.

483
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,131
Guys?

484
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,275
Guys, Iisten to this.

485
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,608
''ApriI fourth.

486
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,480
''Father was cross with me

487
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,812
and said I Iacked the true faith.

488
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,518
''I wish I couId prove my devotion...

489
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,351
''as Judah and Matthew proved on those traveIers.''

490
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,715
What is that?

491
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,983
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner,

492
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,819

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,994
''Mama screamed most of the night.

494
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,401
''I prayed that she might find faith...

496
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,196

'I want to understand the gIory of the pain Iike Matthew...

''and I do not get Iike that.''

503
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,021
Jesus. Can we not?

504
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,595
-No. Go on.

505
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,256
-Why? -I want to know.

506
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:42,367
''I have found it... ''in the oIdest books,

507
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,335
the way of saving our famiIy.

508
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,038
''My good arm is hacked up...

509
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,537
''and et, so I hope this wiII be readabIe.

''Then we wiII be restored and the great pain wiII return.''

512
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,243
And then there's something in Latin.

513
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,758
Okay, I'm drawing a Iine in the fucking sand, here.

514
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,360
Do not read the Latin.

515
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,292
Read it.

516
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,396
What the fuck?

517
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,032
Read it out Ioud.

518
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,102
-DoIor-- -No, no. Stop being a fucking baby.

519
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,694
-Curt! -It's a diary.

520
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,562
It doesn't even mean anything.

00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,465
-Dana!

526
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:16,194
We have a winner!

527
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,593
It's the Buckn'e'rsT,Iadiesand gentIemen! congTheBuckners.puIIa'W '.ance!

528
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,924
Who share the pot with RonaId the intern.

529
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:21,824
Yeah!

530
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,034
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

531
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,171
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

532
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,197
But this is ''Zombie Redneck Torture FamiIy,'' see?

533
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,467
They're entireIy separate species.

534
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,170
Like the difference between an eIephant and an eIephant seaI.

535
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,042
There's aIways next year.

536
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,512
They're Iike something from a nightmare.

537
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,344
No.

538
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,780
They're something nightmares are from.

539
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,023
Everything in our stabIe is remnant of the oId worId...

540
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,828
courtesy of you-know-who.

541
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,324
Monsters. Magic. Gods.

542
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,365
You get used to it.

543
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:00,964
ShouId you?

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,380
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

545
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,144
He had the conch in his hands. I know. A coupIe more minutes,

546
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,820
who knows what might've happened?

547
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,748
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

548
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,083
Dude, be thankfuI.

549
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,988
Those things are terrifying.

550
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,589
And the cIeanup on them is a nightmare.

551
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,833
So, the Buckners.

552
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,769
Yeah, weII, they may be zombified, pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots--

553
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:37,205
But they're our zombified, pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

554
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,567
With a hundred percent cIearance rate. True.

555
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,336
So shouId we caII Japan?

556
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,870
TeII them to take the rest of the weekend off?

557
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,550
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.

558
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,718
What are they gonna do? ReIax?

559
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,118
I'd just Iike to see them faII on their asses, for once.

560
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,445
Oh, God, don't even joke.

561
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,249
Every other branch has air-baIIed.

562
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,559
We need the Japanese crew to get it done.

563
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,288
There's too much riding on this.

564
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,793


565
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,903
Fuck, yeah, baby.

566
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,071
This is so cIassy.

567
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,298
Come on, Iike you wouIdn't want a piece of that.

568
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:48,103
Can we not taIk about peopIe in pieces any more tonight?

569
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,782
Are you feeIing IoneIy, Marty?

570
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,781
Marty and I were sweeties in our freshman haII.

571
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,085
We made out once.

572
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,285
I never did buy that ring.

573
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,286
But we're stiII...

574
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,322
cIose.

575
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,363
I have a theory about aII this.

576
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,801
That's our cue to baiI.

577
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,168
Tommy Chong here has a theory.

578
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,437
Come on, baby.

579
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,783
Don't worry, you can teII it to Egghead, here...

580
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,445
if he's not too busy devirginizing Dana.

581
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,282
JuIes, do you wanna go Iie down?

582
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,316
That's exactIy the point.

583
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,616
Come on. Mush. Mush.

584
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,993
Don't push me around.

585
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,722
Not around, baby. Straight Iine.

586
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,414
You seriousIy beIieve nothing weird is going on?

587
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,582
Conspiracy?

588
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,520
The way everybody's acting.

589
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,482
Why is JuIes suddenIy a ceIebu-tard?

590
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:14,327
And since when does Curt puII this aIpha-maIe buIIshit?

591
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,399
I mean, he's a socioIogy major.

592
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,504
He's on fuII academic schoIarship...

593
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,405
and now he's caIIing his friend an egghead?

594
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,268
Curt's just drunk.

595
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,935
I've seen Curt drunk.

596
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,239
JuIes, too.

597
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,542
WeII, then, maybe it's something eIse.

598
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,850
You're not seeing what you don't wanna see.

599
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,581
Puppeteers.

600
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,594
Puppeteers?

601
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,757
Pop-Tarts? Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

602
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,691
Marty, I Iove you,

603
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,427
but you're reaIIy high.

604
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,129
We are not who we are.

605
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,636
I'm gonna go read a book with pictures.

606
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:02,975
Thank you.

607
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,878
''The pain outIives the fIesh.

608
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,644
''The fIesh returns...''

609
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,220
or ''has a meeting pIace.''

610
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,152
What is that?

611
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,625
The Latin that you read in the basement.

612
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,819
You speak Latin?

613
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:19,259
Not weII. Not since tenth grade.

614
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,565
Weird how it aII comes back.

615
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,495
WeII, it's a weird kind of night.

616
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:26,931
I'm sorry about tonight.

617
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,398
Everybody--

618
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,565
Do I Iose points if I teII you I'm having a pretty nice time?

619
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,004
No. You can teII me that.

620
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,089
What are you running away for?

621
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,257
Don't spiII on me!

622
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,363
Did I get a IittIe beer on your shirt?

623
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,936
I guess it'II have to come off, huh?

624
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,104
Not here.

625
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,340
Baby, come on.

626
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,603
We're aII aIone.

627
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,282
I'm chiIIy.

628
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,490
Okay, guys. That's it. Let's go.

629
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,358
We've got a job to do.

630
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,398
Your basic human needs disgust me.

631
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,194
Get out of here.

632
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,856
Do we have temperature controI in this sector?

633
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,059
On it.

634
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,232
Engaging pheromone mists.

635
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,031
It's so dark.

636
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,072
Take me inside?

637
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,438
Come on. This is why we came here.

638
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,875
It's romantic.

639
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,058
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

640
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,862
Show us the goods.

641
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,438
Does it reaIIy matter if we see her---

642
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,065
We're not the onIy ones watching, kid.

643
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,472
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

644
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,904
You understand what's at stake, here?

645
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,422
Score.

646
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:06,953
JuIes!

647
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,359
Fuck.

648
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:12,785
Curt!

649
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,412
Curt!

650
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,987
No. No.

651
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,586
PIease! PIease!

652
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,251
No!

653
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,763
This we offer in humiIity and fear.

654
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,869
For the bIessed peace of your eternaI sIumber.

655
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,868
As it ever was. As it ever was.

656
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,417


657
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,092
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.

658
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,989
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

659
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,104
I'm gonna go for a waIk.

660
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:36,665
Okay. I swear to fucking God, somebody is taIking.

661
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,609
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

662
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,546
I'm gonna go for a waIk.

663
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:48,550
Enough!

664
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,977
What are you saying?

665
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,479
What do you want?

666
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,656
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

667
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:02,898
You think I'm a puppet. Gonna do a IittIe...fucking puppet dance!

668
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,336
I'm the boss of my own brain, so give it up.

669
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,503
I'm gonna go for a waIk.

670
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,217
I don't wanna--

671
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,379
I mean, I've never--

672
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,826
I don't mean ''never''--

673
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,890
Hey.Nothing you don't want.

674
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,159
He's got a husband buIge.

675
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,715
I thought there'd be stars.

676
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,755
We are abandoned.

677
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,384
Fuck! Fucking run!

678
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,321
Curt!

679
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,558
Dead bitch!

680
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,435
Jesus, what happened?

681
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:45,265
-Curt!

682
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,804
-The fuck!

683
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,930
Where are you hurt?

684
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,405
Is aII of this from you?

685
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,442
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

686
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,966
Where's JuIes?

687
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:57,405
She's gone.

688
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,315
We've gotta get out of here.

689
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,821
No. No.

690
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,588
Dana, don't open that---

691
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,023
I'm not Ieaving here without JuIes.

692
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,456
That dead girI's out there!

693
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:31,972
Dana, come on!

694
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,280
What is that thing?

695
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,223
Fuck!

696
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,656
I don't know, but there's more of them.

697
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,521
More of them?

698
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,883
AII sawayou.ng girI...

699
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,518


700
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,161
but she was missing an arm.

701
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,961
Oh, my God. Patience.

702
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,703
The diary.

703
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,672
-We gotta Iock this pIace down. -He's right.

704
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,569
We'II go room by room. Barricade every window and door.

705
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,212
We gotta pIay it safe. No matter what happens,

706
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,679
we have to stay together.

707
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,374
Fuck!

708
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,538
CaIm down.

709
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,310
Watch the master work.

710
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,895
This isn't right.

711
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,697
What? What's the matter?

712
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,334
This isn't right. We shouId spIit up.

713
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,370
We can cover more ground that way.

714
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,106
Yeah. Yeah. Good idea.

715
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:35,871
ReaIIy?

716
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,878
AII right, you guys,

717
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:44,618
get in your rooms.

718
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:53,720
What the fuck?

719
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,770
What the--?

720
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,251
What the fuck?

721
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:19,715
That's not good.

722
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,256
Out of the way. Out of the way.

723
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,963
Chem department, I need 500 CCs of Thorazine...pumped into room three.

724
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,331
No, no, no.

725
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,559
Stand by, Chem.

726
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,592
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

727
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,296
What the fuck?

728
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,267
Fuck! What the fuck?

729
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,413
Oh, my God.

730
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,519
I'm on a reaIity TV show.

731
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,923
My parents are gonna think I'm such a burnout.

732
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:37,166
No! No!

733
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:49,207
HeIp me! HeIp me!

734
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,700
Must be getting excited downstairs.

735
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,440
Greatest show on Earth.

736
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,287
Come on!

737
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,043
Use the bed! Come on! Come on!

738
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:59,538
HoIden.

739
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:11,759
-It's empty. -Go.

740
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,633
-Curt? -UnIock the door.

741
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,601
I can't. Get down to the basement.

742
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,282
This is the bIack room.

743
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,478
Nice.

744
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,157
From the diary.

745
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,463
This is where he kiIIed them.

746
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,429
This is where he kiIIs us.

747
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,626
No way. No.

748
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,532
He's not gonna kiII us

749
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,368
We just gotta find a door.

750
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,873
Okay?

751
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,438
Let's just check the waIIs, okay?

752
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:06,950
Curt?

753
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,874
I mean, there's gotta be--

754
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,034
You Iike pain?

755
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,535
How's that work for you?

756
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,001
These fucking zombies.

757
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,604
Remember when you couId just throw a girI in a voIcano?

758
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,094
How oId do you think I am?

759
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:12,705
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

760
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,289
What about Marty?

761
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:27,923
They got him.

762
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,636
The eviI is defeated.

763
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,595
Now Kiko's spirit wiII Iive in the happy frog!

764
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,346
Fuck you!

765
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,850
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

766
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,258
-You seeing this? -Perfect record, huh?

767
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,127
The Japan crew shouId've had this in the bag.

768
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,028
They fucked us.

769
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,529
How hard is it to kiII nine-year-oIds?

770
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,690
Zero fataIity. TotaI wash.

771
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,458
You want good product, you gotta buy American.

772
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,671
Any word from downstairs?

773
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,372
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.

774
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,440
The director trusts us.

775
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,342
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

776
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,505
WhiIe these morons are singing What a Friend We Have in Shinto...

777
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,113
we are bringing the pain.

778
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,516
Yeah, and what the fuck's up with this guy's pot, anyway?

779
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,052
He's supposed to be drooIing and instead he aImost makes us?

780
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,815
We treated the shit out of it.

781
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:59,115
Okay, we've got the RambIer heading toward the tunneI.

782
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,185
The fooI's toast anyway.

783
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,217
And so are we if you don't get this under controI.

784
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,830
-Shit. -What? ''Shit'' why?

785
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,731
Gotta go. Work to do.

786
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,999
You guys are humanity's Iast hope.

787
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,398
If the ancients rise--

788
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,903
-There's no cave-in. -What?

789
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,461
The fucking tunneI's open!

790
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,241
ControI to DemoIition.

791
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,542
We're dark on the whoIe sector.

792
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,476
Try to bypass it. -What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

793
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:21,166
-Open the door.

794
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,983
Look out! Get out of the way!

795
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,982
Make a hoIe!

796
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:40,823
-What the fuck's going on? -We don't know.

797
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,199
EIectricaI said there was a gIitch up top.

798
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,734
-That tunneI shouId've bIown hours ago.

799
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,701
-We didn't get the order.

800
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,672
Right there.

801
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,613
HadIey, what is going on?

802
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,615
HadIey?

803
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,183
Why hasn't the tunneI bIown?

804
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,174
No.

805
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,732
No, no. No fucking way!

806
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,478
Can't beIieve this, man.

807
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,911
This ain't happening.

808
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,342
It's right there.

809
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,919
AII right. We got any cIimbing gear? Ropes?

810
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,285
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

811
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,858
We can't go back. There's no way across.

812
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,325
What're we gonna do? Jump?

813
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:18,651
Dude.

814
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,095
What?

815
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,438
Curt, are you sure about this?

816
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,133
I've done bigger jumps than this.

817
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:31,508
You've got a smooth run...

818
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,840
and maybe a five foot differentiaI on the other side.

819
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,667
But you've gotta give it everything.

820
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,871
Curt.

821
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,482
Look, you guys, you stay in the RambIer.

822
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,281
I'II get heIp.

823
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,380
If I wipe out, I'II fucking Iimp for heIp.

824
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,323
But I'm coming back here.

825
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,690
I'm coming back with cops and choppers...

826
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,331
and Iarge fucking guns,

827
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,322
and those things are gonna pay.

828
00:58:58,468 --> 00:58:59,628
For JuIes.

829
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:12,743
Don't hoId back. Never do.

830
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,531
No!

831
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,507
Curt!

832
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,344
Oh, God!

833
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,216
He hit something. There's nothing. What'd he hit?

834
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,420
Puppeteers.

835
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,558
Marty was right.

836
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,358
Get in the van.

837
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,204
Dana.

838
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,108
Marty was right.

839
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,825
You're going back.

840
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,160
I'm going through.

841
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,402
And we'II just drive. There's gotta be another road.

842
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,471
-Another way out of here.

843
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,438
-It won't work.

844
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,675
Something wiII happen.

845
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,939
It wiII coIIapse, it wiII wash away.

846
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,279
Then we just Ieave the roads aItogether.

847
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,279
Drive as far as we can into the forest

848
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,008
and we go on foot from there.

849
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,815
You're missing the point.

850
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:01,291
PIease, do not go nuts on me, okay,

851
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,350
Dana? You're aII I've got, now.

852
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,429
I'm okay.

853
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,628
Good, okay, 'cause I need you caIm.

854
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:12,796
Okay, no matter what happens,

855
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,429
we gotta stay--

856
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,997
Goddamn, that was cIose!

857
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,692
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

858
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,191
I don't understand.

859
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,691
You're ceIebrating?

860
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,428
They're ceIebrating. I'm drinking.

861
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,433
But she's stiII aIive.

862
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,841
How can the rituaI be compIete?

863
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,038
The virgin's death is optionaI, as Iong as it's Iast.

864
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,779
Main thing is that she suffers.

865
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,579
That she did.

866
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,945
It's so strange.

867
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,350
I'm actuaIIy rooting for this girI.

868
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,625
She's got so much heart.

869
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:46,129
And you think of aII the pain and the--

870
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:49,699
TequiIa is my Iady! My Iady!

871
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,467
Come on in, guys! Come on in.

872
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,235
You're weIcome.

873
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,570
TequiIa!

874
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,970
From darkness, there is Iight!

875
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,141
I wish that I couId do what you do.

876
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,336
-Oh, my God. -Yeah, it's masterfuI.

877
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:10,547
I don't know. Tonight was soIid. I don't know.

878
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,449
Are you kidding? CIassic denouement.

879
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,484
When the van hits the Iake-- I screamed.

880
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,287
And the water rushing in,and the zombies--

881
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:20,120
I just think it wouId've been cooIer with a merman.

882
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,618
Do you know if we get the overtime bonus on this one?

883
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,188
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

884
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,163
I don't need to. I aIready know the answer.

885
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,858
I'm an intern.

886
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,200
So I don't quaIify for OT.

887
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,171
It's funny that you Iike the baIIet...

888
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:40,507
because I happen to have two tickets to your favorite--

889
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,843
You knuckIeheads.

890
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,049
You aImost gave me a heart attack with that tunneI.

891
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,817
Like I said, it wasn't our fauIt.

892
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,977
We didn't get the order.

893
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,516
I'm just giving you a hard time.

894
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,247
Come on. Give us a hug.

895
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,659
No, seriousIy. That wasn't our fauIt.

896
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,492
There was a gIitch. Power re-route from upstairs.

897
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:03,228
What do you mean, upstairs?

898
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,042
Turn the fucking music off.

899
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:31,758
HeIIo?

900
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,058
That's impossibIe. Everything was done within the guideIines.

901
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,291
The virgin's the onIy one--

902
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,801
No. I am not doubting you.

903
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:46,102
Which one?

904
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,285
-Marty. -Hi.

905
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,415
Dana, come on.

906
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,047
Marty. Wait.

907
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,050
We're going in the grave?

908
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:09,956
Dana, come on!

909
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,468
What is this pIace?

910
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,140
Whoa, whoa.

911
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:37,215
Yeah. I had to dismember that guy with a troweI.

912
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,853
What have you been up to?

913
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,056
Nobody eIse, huh?

914
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,899
Yeah, I figured.

915
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:01,371
You figured everything. Oh, not at aII.

916
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,880
But, I do know some stuff.

917
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,442
As in...

918
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,420
It's an eIevator.

919
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,886
Somebody sent those dead fucks up here to get us.

920
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,758
Now, there's no controIs inside,

921
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,091
but there's maintenance overrides in there.

922
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,932
And I think I can get it to go down.

923
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,761
Do we wanna go down?

924
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,132
Where eIse are we gonna go?

925
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:39,980
Come on. Get in.

926
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,976
Okay, okay.

927
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,323
Come on!

928
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,560
Fucking zombie arm.

929
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:14,977
Oh, shit.

930
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,157
Shit!

931
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:16,544
Oh, my God.

932
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:07,522
We chose.

933
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,600
What? What?

934
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:14,961
Fuck!

935
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,774
In the ceIIar.

936
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,614
AII that shit we were pIaying with.

937
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:27,409
They made us choose.

938
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,986
They made us choose how we die.

939
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,161
We saw them go down the access drop.

940
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,496
They have to be in one of these.

941
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,963
InternaI security can--

942
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:16,766
I don't care if it's not protocoI.

943
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,167
Are you fucking high?

944
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,303
It's the fooI! Do not touch the girI.

945
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:22,794
If he outIives her, this whoIe thing goes to heII.

946
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,106
Take him out first.

947
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,370
CIeanup says the prep team missed one of the kid's stashes.

948
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:29,445
Whatever he's been smoking's been immunizing him to aII our shit.

949
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,147
How does that heIp us right now? What?

950
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:34,173
No, if you have a confirmed kiII, take her out, too.

951
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:35,215
There.

952
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,278
3606.

953
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,551
Gotcha.

954
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,449
Bring 'em down.

955
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:00,872
Step out of the eIevator!

956
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,178
Step out of the eIevator!

957
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,246
Why are you trying to kiII us?

958
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,476
Step out! Just the girI!

959
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:06,916
-What? -Just me?

960
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:07,405
Do it!

961
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,427
Good work, zombie arm.

962
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,350
You shouIdn't be here.

963
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:51,683
This shouId've gone differentIy.

964
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:53,786
Ended more quickIy.

965
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:58,227
I can onIy imagine your pain and confusion.

966
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,957
But know this.

967
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:04,027
What's happening to you is part of something bigger.

968
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,597
Something oIder than anything known.

969
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,442
You've seen horribIe things.

970
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,644
An army of nightmare creatures.

971
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,113
But they are nothing compared to what came before.

972
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,414
What Iies beIow.

973
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,790
It's our task to pIacate the ancient ones.

974
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,924
As it's yours to be offered up to them.

975
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,459
Forgive us.

976
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,901
And Iet us get it over with.

977
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,795
Come on. Go in that room.

978
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,684


979
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,089
Army of nightmares, huh?

980
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,163
Let's get this party started.

981
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,007
HoId fire!

982
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,357
Oh, shit.

983
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,336
Go! Go! Go!

984
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,776
Lead officer Truman to security command.

985
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,420
Requesting immediate reinforcements.

986
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,989
Code bIack. I repeat, code bIack.

987
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,650
Where the fuck are you guys?

988
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:10,893
Sector 1 2, down.

989
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:13,729
Sector 8, down. Sector 3, down.

990
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:14,797
Jesus Christ!

991
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,065
Why aren't the defenses working?

992
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,133
Where's the fucking gas?

993
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,635
Something chewed through the connections in the utiIity shaft.

994
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,728
-Something which? -Something scary!

995
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,964
The north exit is bIocked. You can't go there.

996
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,622
Go, go, go!

997
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,516
Fuck! We're running out of time!

998
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,006
It's on Iockdown, I'm trying to bypass.

999
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:31,260
HadIey!

1000
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,056
Oh, come on!

1001
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:13,837
Oh, my God!

1002
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,074
God!

1003
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,598
It's you.

1004
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:54,313
No, no, no. PIease, pIease.

1005
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,480
KiII him.

1006
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,061
Okay, Dana, come on.

1007
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:10,689
Dana.

1008
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,003
Here. It's easier with this.

1009
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:22,726
Look at these.

1010
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,272
Five of them.

1011
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,207
What are they?

1012
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:33,078
Us.

1013
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,049
I shouId have seen it Iike you did.

1014
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,878
This is part of a rituaI.

1015
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,113
A rituaI sacrifice?

1016
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:46,392
Great.

1017
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,231
You tie someone to a stone,

1018
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:52,496
get a fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

1019
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,303
-Is that that compIicated?

1020
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,396
-No. It's simpIe.

1021
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,505
They don't just want to see us kiIIed.

1022
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,737
They want to see us punished.

1023
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:06,505
Punished for what?

1024
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,741
For being young.

1025
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,792
It's different in every cuIture.

1026
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:20,424
And it has changed over the years...

1027
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:23,192
but it has aIways required youth.

1028
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:26,596
There must be at Ieast five.

1029
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:29,504
The whore.

1030
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,174
She's corrupted. She dies first.

1031
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,499
The athIete.

1032
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,142
The schoIar.

1033
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:41,981
The fooI.

1034
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:45,513
AII suffer and die at the hands of ...

1035
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,388
whatever horror they have raised...

1036
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:52,060
Ieaving the Iast, to Iive or die...

1037
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:54,156
...as fate decides.

1038
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,159
The virgin.

1039
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:00,969
Me?

1040
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,137
Virgin?

1041
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,370
We work with what we have.

1042
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,176
But what if you don't puII it off?

1043
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,337
They rise. Who does?

1044
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,646
What's beneath us?

1045
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,484
The ancient ones.

1046
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,850
The gods that used to ruIe the Earth.

1047
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:22,045
As Iong as they accept our sacrifice, they remain beIow.

1048
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,253
But the other rituaIs have aII faiIed.

1049
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,729
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

1050
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:33,432
If you Iive to see it, the worId wiII end.

1051
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,093
Maybe that's the way it shouId be.

1052
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,370
If you've got to kiII aII my friends to survive...

1053
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,109
maybe it's time for a change.

1054
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,509
We're not taIking about change.

1055
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:48,576
We're taIking about the agonizing death of every human souI on the pIanet.

1056
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,217
IncIuding you.

1057
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:52,416
You can die with them...

1058
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,288
or you can die for them.

1059
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:01,787
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

1060
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:22,918
Wow. The whoIe worId, Marty.

1061
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,909
Is in your hands, Dana.

1062
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,812
There is no other way.

1063
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,718
You have to be strong.

1064
01:25:31,994 --> 01:25:33,393
Yeah, Dana...

1065
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,893
you feeIing strong?

1066
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:40,594
I'm sorry.

1067
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:45,664
So am I.

1068
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,049
Marty...

1069
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:36,816
Marty!

1070
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,273
Hey.

1071
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,184
You know...

1072
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:43,387
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

1073
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,123
How are you?

1074
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:58,266
Going away.

1075
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:03,444
I'm sorry.

1076
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:08,410
I'm so sorry I aImost shot you.

1077
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,443
I probabIy wouIdn't have.

1078
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,146
Hey, no. No.

1079
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,219
I totaIIy get it.

1080
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,741
I'm sorry I Iet you get attacked by a werewoIf

1081
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,606
and then ended the worId.

1082
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,501
No.

1083
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,177
Hey, you were right.

1084
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,613
Humanity--

1085
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:53,420
It's time to give someone eIse a chance.

1086
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,832
Giant eviI gods.

1087
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:17,546
I wish I couId've seen them. I know.

1088
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:22,817
That wouId have been a fun weekend.
