1
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,827
I've heard of you before.

2
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,099
Really?

3
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:09,667
You major in piano, right?

4
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:10,970
Yeah.

5
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,434
Why did you transfer to our school?

6
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:15,873
Something wrong with yours?

7
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:18,238
Your school is more beautiful.

8
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,981
And... My Dad made me.

9
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,812
Hi!

10
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:24,749
Classmate?

11
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:25,683
Yeah.

12
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,819
The school is famous for its piano?

13
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:33,061
Yeah, we're all very hard-working.

14
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,455
You too, right?

15
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:36,056
I'm okay.

16
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:39,668
Look here,

17
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:42,664
These 2 floors are all piano rooms.

18
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,301
You study piano, you'll be here often.

19
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:50,210
It's beautiful!

20
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:53,516
This building is over 100 years old.

21
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:54,547
100 years?

22
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,343
But we're tearing it

23
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,779
down on graduation day.

24
00:01:58,556 --> 00:01:59,318
Why?

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,581
To build a new one!

26
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,661
We won't be using it
after graduation though.

27
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,521
Later students are more fortunate.

28
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,325
Come practice often!

29
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,529
Sure.

30
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:14,899
This is a really nice school.

31
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:16,930
Want me to show you inside?

32
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,640
I'll be fine on my own!

33
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,007
If I get lost, I'll yell for help!

34
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:20,803
Excuse me, were you playing?

35
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,336
No.

36
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:26,209
There isn't anyone else.

37
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,576
Okay, it was me.

38
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,038
It sounded beautiful.

39
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:32,145
Thanks.

40
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:39,216
In 19th century,

41
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:41,654
there was a musical genius

42
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:45,327
later known as the piano poet,

43
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:46,290
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:48,362
That's Chopin.

45
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,294
Why was he a musical genius?

46
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:58,102
Hey, pay attention in class!

47
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:05,838
He started learning piano at age of 6,

48
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:08,041
but when he was 8 years old,

49
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,884
he has already performed publicly

50
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,549
and successfully played a concerto

51
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,481
which made him famous.

52
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,018
But why was he called a piano poet?

53
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,858
Because his work is described

54
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:25,024
to be fluid and graceful like a poem.

55
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,021
- What?
- Why are you following me?

56
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,225
I'm not.

57
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:56,188
No? Bye then!

58
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,203
I want to ask you!

59
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,935
What's the name of the song you played?

60
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,128
It sounded beautiful!

61
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,641
That's a secret!

62
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,508
What's so secretive about that?

63
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,022
What's your name?

64
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,556
I told you already.

65
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,324
I hear you from far away.

66
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:31,166
Let's go.

67
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,633
This is a school!
Not a place to pick up girls.

68
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,440
Watch yourself

69
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,808
and pay attention in class!

70
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,449
Want me to give you a ride on the way?

71
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,491
How did you know it's on the way?

72
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:09,771
Why the sudden rain?
You don't have an umbrella?

73
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:28,218
Why are you so quiet?

74
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,726
It's a secret no matter what I ask.

75
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:35,726
Which musician do you like?

76
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,693
All of them.

77
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,061
Do you like the sun or the rain?

78
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,134
Like them both.

79
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,271
You play the piano well!

80
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,147
Very well!

81
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:55,878
Very well!

82
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:58,254
Will you play for me next time?

83
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:00,245
No!

84
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,149
That's ok. I'll hear it sooner or later.

85
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,495
I'm almost home.

86
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:14,833
Really?

87
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:19,400
It's fine here, thanks!

88
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,338
It's fine, I'll take you to the door.

89
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,069
I don't want my family to see.

90
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,084
Hey, what's your name?

91
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,078
I'm Rain.

92
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,425
My name is Jay.

93
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:37,690
Bye!

94
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,437
Aren't you making dinner?

95
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,019
Right, I almost forgot!

96
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,319
Here, I got it all ready.

97
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,722
That's okay, I'll get it from your Dad.

98
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:11,690
Really?

99
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:12,653
Thanks!

100
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,262
You look happy today!

101
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:15,187
Ok, bye!

102
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,264
Ride carefully! Bye!

103
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:48,661
Dinner will be ready soon!

104
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:01,307
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

105
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:07,347
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, change.

106
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,883
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

107
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,284
Jay, what're you looking for?

108
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,619
Nothing.

109
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:15,088
Looking for someone?

110
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:19,420
Good morning.

111
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,358
Good morning.

112
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,602
Okay, let's look at question 2

113
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,769
and see which student knows the answer.

114
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,235
Raise your hands. You!

115
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,038
B, 2nd augmented.

116
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,904
Very good, please sit.

117
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,314
Okay, question 3

118
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:44,646
The answer is A, sub key of A major.

119
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,263
Did 2 students come in?

120
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:10,743
He's gone!

121
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,713
You're a standup guy!

122
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,310
Are you new?

123
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,252
Yeah, music class!

124
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:23,283
I'm Bob, he's Lance.

125
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:25,355
We're in the rugby team.

126
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,823
He's the captain because he's old.

127
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,663
What're you talking about!

128
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:34,496
I gave my youth to rugby!

129
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,137
I've chosen this long
and arduous path

130
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,372
because the school needs me!

131
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:41,703
Got it?

132
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:48,841
Pay attention when I'm talking!

133
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,411
Let's go! You don't even study music!

134
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,724
Come watch us play next week, bye!

135
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,351
- Leaving now, bye! - Bye!

136
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,418
The coach is so dumb!

137
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:01,661
Stupid!

138
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:05,331
Really dumb!

139
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,573
Did I scare you?

140
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,005
You scared me!

141
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:17,607
Why weren't you in class?

142
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:18,974
I was practicing!

143
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,411
Why? You miss me?

144
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:24,112
Yeah!

145
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:26,550
I miss your music!

146
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:30,692
But I miss you...

147
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,690
Your music!

148
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,059
The weather is so nice today.

149
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,931
The weather is so nice today.

150
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,688
Come here!

151
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:09,195
Crouch!

152
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:14,431
Crouch, now!

153
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:16,034
Let's go!

154
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:22,573
How many people in your family?

155
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:26,744
My family? Just me and my Mom.

156
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:28,347
What about you?

157
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:29,541
Just me and my Dad.

158
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,044
Just me and my Dad.

159
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:32,553
Stop copying me!

160
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:33,620
It's true though.

161
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,089
What does your Dad do?

162
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:39,493
You don't know?

163
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,488
How would I know?

164
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,693
Never mind then.

165
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,230
What's so secretive about that?

166
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:49,735
You're not the only one with secrets.

167
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,176
So tasty!

168
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:03,846
I've never had this.

169
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:07,647
Really? Then have more!

170
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:11,421
Cheers!

171
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,153
Nobody cheers with ice creams!

172
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:43,018
Jay is gonna start!!

173
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:44,555
Hurry, or we'll miss it!

174
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,297
Hey, you're supposed to...

175
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:50,562
keep the school lively!

176
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:57,932
Let's follow the chicks!

177
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:04,339
The new guy is going to challenge Howe.

178
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,807
What a brave thing to do.

179
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,717
Let's applaud to that!

180
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:11,685
What're they doing?

181
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,887
Piano battle, don't you know?

182
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,724
Ladies, do you all know me?

183
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:20,962
Mr. Ice!

184
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:25,767
That's right! And this is Howe.

185
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,199
Do you all know his nickname?

186
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,199
Prince of piano.

187
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,333
Right, because

188
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,512
there isn't one song he can't play!

189
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,541
And no one can compare to him.

190
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,046
What Prince of piano.

191
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,518
- Out of my way! - Okay!

192
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:43,913
Without further a due,

193
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:47,051
let's begin with our piano battle!

194
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,778
Whoa, turning black keys to white keys!

195
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:25,720
New guy, did you listen carefully?

196
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,958
Don't you miss a key now!

197
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:09,668
Not bad! You didn't miss one single key!

198
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:11,903
Looks like we need something harder.

199
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:21,477
Chopin Waltz? That's too easy.

200
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,687
I knew it wasn't going to be that easy.

201
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:38,529
Come on!

202
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:40,660
Hey, keep up!

203
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:47,074
I said keep up, not stand up!

204
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:49,910
Isn't he cute?

205
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,583
Even Chopin didn't know this part!

206
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:56,484
Aren't you all lucky to hear that!

207
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,116
Howe's improvisation is brilliant!

208
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:01,419
New guy!

209
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,623
That's my friend.

210
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:42,158
It's going to be a good show today!

211
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:48,161
Howe, keep up...

212
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,324
The battle today is just brilliant!

213
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,537
Let's give them a round of applause!

214
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,704
Okay, back to class!

215
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,343
I'm a man of my words, here.

216
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,472
You're really giving it to him? It's rare!

217
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:40,546
Thanks!

218
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,115
- That was good! - Okay!

219
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:47,016
See you in class.

220
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:06,332
Why do you do that?

221
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:08,976
I can have a heart attack, you know?

222
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:12,811
Hungry!

223
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:13,880
Very hungry!

224
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:18,644
You like to scare people from the back!

225
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:21,513
That's because I like your back.

226
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,365
You played well yesterday.

227
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,199
You were there?

228
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:37,498
Yeah, I didn't want to distract you.

229
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,343
How can you? No girls can distract me!

230
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,448
I can still play smoothly!

231
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,219
Don't be mad!

232
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:53,020
I'm just kidding.

233
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,791
Why did you battle yesterday?

234
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:03,621
For this egg!

235
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,098
That's a secret!

236
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,936
Come on!

237
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:17,072
Jay, Bob and I

238
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,679
are playing for the welcome party,

239
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:20,973
you played well yesterday,

240
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:24,015
how about I count you in?

241
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:28,485
Sure!

242
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:31,120
Then it's a deal! Stick to your words now!

243
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:32,886
What deal?

244
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,067
Jay, you come here too!

245
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:44,537
See you in the piano room!

246
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:54,745
Stand straight!

247
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:59,050
Who said you can eat here?

248
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,614
Does this look like a place to eat?

249
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,488
Would you jog in a cafeteria?

250
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:08,792
Why don't you tuck in your shirt?

251
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,628
What kind of belt is this?

252
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:15,869
You think you're a singer?

253
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,471
Is that how to wear a tie?

254
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,310
If you don't cut your hair by tomorrow,

255
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:23,444
I'll cut it for you!

256
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,477
Girls like it!

257
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:27,580
Girls like bad appearance?

258
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,750
Got a smoke?

259
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,453
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

260
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,723
Can I have one?

261
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,635
I've got a lighter.

262
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:49,432
It's okay.

263
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,939
It's been a long time.

264
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:00,078
Yeah.

265
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:03,975
Why do you have cigarettes??

266
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:10,454
8 smokes, 8 laps! Go now!

267
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,865
What kind of friends have you made?

268
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:20,262
Friends who smoke?

269
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,570
Go now!

270
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,022
Trying to scare me again?

271
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,391
Are they your friends?

272
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:46,355
Yeah.

273
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:48,195
They don't look like your friends.

274
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:50,592
I don't look like your friend.

275
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,966
You're special, I'm ordinary.

276
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:58,766
I think you're special too!

277
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,978
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

278
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:06,744
Really?

279
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,009
If I'm a friend to you,

280
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:14,114
then tell me why are you so mysterious?

281
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,414
I'll tell you if you can catch up to me.

282
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:26,795
You like to play single-handed.

283
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,701
Because I want to hold your hand
with the other.

284
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,627
I heard 4 hands playing,

285
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,393
but you're alone?

286
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,067
I played so fast,

287
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:37,901
you thought there are 2 people.

288
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,689
You students! Unbelievable.

289
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:59,116
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

290
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:04,390
Good pianist can get away with things.

291
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:08,203
Because I'm a good student,
so teachers like me.

292
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,504
Yeah, right!

293
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,319
That's Chopin's lover.
They were together for 10 years.

294
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:25,247
But eventually parted.

295
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:31,185
To have each other, 10 years is plenty.

296
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:36,789
Is there something on your mind?

297
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,560
I don't know,

298
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,998
maybe I'll tell you someday.

299
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,839
Just cherish our moments together.

300
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:51,042
Sure!

301
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,441
Let's go!

302
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:58,114
Where?

303
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,450
Cherish our moments together!

304
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:06,759
So fast!

305
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,192
Go!

306
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,732
Don't ride so fast!

307
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,306
I'll be home too soon!

308
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:25,278
Really? Alright then.

309
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,384
It's beautiful!

310
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,392
Want to stop here?

311
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:55,402
Have you been busy lately?

312
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:00,876
Dinner is just ready

313
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,675
when I get home.

314
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:08,487
Don't you think that tastes better?

315
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,293
You're dating someone, right?

316
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,134
No, just out with Lance and Bob.

317
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:29,041
Bob and Lance! I knew it!

318
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,543
They are bad people,

319
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:33,305
don't make those friends!

320
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:37,282
They smoke, don't listen to music!

321
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:41,183
They don't listen to music so they're bad?

322
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:43,217
Of course!

323
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:45,324
Don't make it hard for me!

324
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,120
What's so hard about that?

325
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,398
You're my only son,

326
00:28:52,134 --> 00:28:55,194
I'm just worried about you.

327
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,666
Answer properly!

328
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:00,739
Okay

329
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:04,343
And don't make those friends, understand?

330
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:09,446
I'm done!

331
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:13,388
Are you on a diet?

332
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:25,065
Look at this,

333
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:26,165
misplacing the CD's.

334
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,065
Pay more attention!

335
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:37,337
Don't daydream all the time, be proper.

336
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,808
Be someone ordinary!

337
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,059
I've listened to music for decades.

338
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:58,663
Young people shouldn't think so much.

339
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,602
I didn't!

340
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:09,841
How long haven't you listened to music?

341
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:12,638
If I haven't,

342
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:15,544
how would I misplace the CD?

343
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:01,526
Music has many different forms.

344
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,595
We can use different instruments,

345
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,359
to mix and
have different types of feelings.

346
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:09,603
Like just a while ago,
we had piano and flute.

347
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,934
Let's have one of the music majors

348
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:14,336
come up and do an example for us.

349
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:17,575
Sky, how about you?

350
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:22,512
Sky, did you hear what I said?

351
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:27,254
How about you?

352
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,103
Jay, want to shoot some hoops later?

353
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:52,245
I'll pass!

354
00:31:58,754 --> 00:31:59,721
I'll return the book tomorrow!

355
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:00,752
Okay!

356
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,888
Later! Bye!

357
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:03,080
Sure, bye!

358
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:06,889
Bye, Sky!

359
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,027
Can you give me a ride home?

360
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:12,766
Your bike, give me ride home?

361
00:32:17,673 --> 00:32:19,834
Never mind, I'm just kidding, bye!

362
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:21,605
Bye!

363
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:24,837
Can you give me a ride home?

364
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,114
Sure, come on! You're such a copycat!

365
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:30,148
You're so bad!

366
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:31,080
What?

367
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,319
Someone missed class today!

368
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,715
I was practicing in the piano room!

369
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:39,723
Sure? Then I'll take you some place.

370
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:41,127
No class later?

371
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:43,826
Jump aboard or I'll take Sky!

372
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,658
Okay, let's go!

373
00:32:57,513 --> 00:33:01,813
Quit messing,
you said it was only for 3 days!

374
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:03,716
It's been 2 weeks,

375
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,683
I'm gonna get hell from my boss!

376
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:10,358
What? Alright, I'll have a look.

377
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,134
This is my favorite song.

378
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:40,378
Well? Do you like it?

379
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:09,306
Keep the change!

380
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:10,576
Thanks!

381
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:46,610
We're not going inside, hurry!

382
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,846
What's wrong?

383
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:28,495
It's asthma, I just need a short break.

384
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:30,229
Don't scare me now.

385
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:38,732
So, I can't kiss a boy.

386
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,905
Can't hold hands,

387
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:45,576
can't do anything too exciting.

388
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,760
Really?

389
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:09,967
Just messing with you, I feel better.

390
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:17,644
I'll tell you a secret.

391
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:21,711
Okay.

392
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,084
I...

393
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:40,963
counted 108 steps
from class to the piano room.

394
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:42,203
That's silly.

395
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:46,004
Forget that I've said it then!

396
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,100
Fine!

397
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:54,809
I've counted too!

398
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:59,479
It's 5 steps from here to you!

399
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,447
How would you know?

400
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:09,390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

401
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:17,336
You almost had me!

402
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,533
Such a silly game!

403
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:39,657
It's Swan, this is so hard to find!

404
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:45,288
You did the piano battle

405
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,130
to get this for me?

406
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,266
Yeah.

407
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:58,972
You don't have many friends, right?

408
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:02,109
Nobody likes me.

409
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:04,376
How can that be?

410
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:05,820
Do you like me?

411
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:20,960
I like you.

412
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,266
The world is a peaceful lullaby.

413
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,165
But I insist on my manhood.

414
00:38:57,372 --> 00:38:59,806
Face all my enemies with an iron will.

415
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:02,909
Love you tenderly under the moon.

416
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:07,707
Men do not play sissy games.

417
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,980
Life is like calm scenery.

418
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,711
I insist with the shade of my manhood,

419
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:16,447
to give heat to my brothers,

420
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:19,684
and leave the chest for the girls' tears.

421
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:21,089
I'm a total man!

422
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:25,164
Watch out, girls!

423
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:27,595
Adjusting my manly breath,

424
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:30,465
shaking my manly hairstyle,

425
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:33,197
open my manly eyes,

426
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:36,377
to give you a sweet face.

427
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:40,514
I'll charm you with my manly smile!

428
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,652
Men with biceps of a mountain,

429
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:47,253
men with Ioneliness of wolves,

430
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,084
men with heated passion,

431
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:53,090
men with warm hearts,

432
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:54,489
that man is me.

433
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,027
Watch out girls!

434
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,220
That man is me,

435
00:39:57,432 --> 00:40:01,835
and you've fallen for me!

436
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:21,749
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

437
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:24,983
When?

438
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:26,257
Graduation day!

439
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:33,190
Then do you want to learn it?

440
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,892
That song I played the first time
you met me?

441
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,037
You're really going to teach me?

442
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,433
Finally?

443
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:23,777
Do you have to play so fast?

444
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,650
That's how fast I play before I go home.

445
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,080
That's hard to remember.

446
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:33,257
Don't play this in the old piano room.

447
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:35,793
Why?

448
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:38,863
It sounds bad on the old piano.

449
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:41,067
I thought it's

450
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:42,258
because Sky usually plays there.

451
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,528
So you don't want me there.

452
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:47,297
I'll play you a song too!

453
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:48,637
Now?

454
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:49,810
Not now!

455
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,671
On graduation day, I'll play for you!

456
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,618
Alright, it's a deal!

457
00:41:58,653 --> 00:41:59,642
Aren't we too old for this?

458
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:03,551
123, Push!

459
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:05,783
Push, push.

460
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:36,918
That looks nice, a gift from you boyfriend?

461
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:39,250
I don't have a boyfriend.

462
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:41,225
Oh, you don't have a boyfriend.

463
00:42:58,513 --> 00:42:59,605
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

464
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:32,203
Can you sign for me?

465
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:33,440
Sure!

466
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:36,479
- You guys are so good!
- We're just okay.

467
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:38,747
Thank you!

468
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:41,217
Next week is the championship,
want to come?

469
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:42,447
Can we? Thank you

470
00:43:42,657 --> 00:43:43,214
Of course!

471
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:45,359
You're so cool! Bye!

472
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,822
Bye!

473
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,455
You're so cool!

474
00:43:56,504 --> 00:43:57,698
Hey, Jay!

475
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,302
Men don't play sissy games!

476
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:03,067
Jay!

477
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:05,212
Not bad!
Girls from our class ask you to sign!

478
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:06,573
That's nothing!

479
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,544
You have to get use to it
when you hang with us!

480
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:10,281
Got a question!

481
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:11,712
Shoot!

482
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,185
Have you athletes heard of asthma?

483
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:16,485
What are you? Stupid?

484
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:18,750
- That's so easy, bye now!
- Bye!

485
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,690
That's so easy, it's a sort of cold.

486
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:24,023
Bull! You're not even close!

487
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:26,166
It's a sport injury!

488
00:44:26,368 --> 00:44:27,027
Really?

489
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:27,929
Yeah!

490
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:29,262
I better ask someone else.

491
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:33,404
A sport injury?

492
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:34,404
Yeah!

493
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:04,003
You're back!

494
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:05,672
You play well when I'm not around.

495
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:08,264
Just learned it!

496
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:09,807
From who?

497
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:11,734
None of your business.

498
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,280
What's good for asthma?

499
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:23,251
Dancing, dancing's good for asthma.

500
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,722
Crap! What's really good for asthma?

501
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:27,924
Food makes you crap,

502
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:31,963
dancing doesn't. And...

503
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,825
Dance with me, and I'll tell you!

504
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:35,764
How about it?

505
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:17,740
Dad, are you done?

506
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:18,944
Just about!

507
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,417
What's good for asthma?

508
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:34,418
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS DOCTOR AWAY

509
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:41,058
By the way,
the market lady gave us some apple!

510
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,427
So it's apples?

511
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:43,066
Yeah

512
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:43,760
Don't play with me!

513
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,133
Apple!

514
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:53,241
How do you turn this on?

515
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,537
York, what else do you want to listen to?

516
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,673
It's class time,
I'll play for you next time!

517
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:34,979
So many apples!

518
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,082
Want some?

519
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:38,418
Can I?

520
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,324
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

521
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:44,896
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

522
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:46,764
What does that have to do with apples?

523
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:48,959
I bought them for you!

524
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:50,697
I'm like a fool everyday!

525
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:54,363
I brought all these,
but you're not even here.

526
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:57,542
Give them to Sky then!

527
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:00,640
Sky? Sure,

528
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,914
I have so many of them anyways.

529
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,678
What the? Are you mad?

530
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:09,550
When I'm not in school,

531
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:12,726
will you like other girls?

532
00:48:14,062 --> 00:48:15,120
Yeah, 15 other girls.

533
00:48:21,903 --> 00:48:23,063
Hey, help me out!

534
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:36,749
Bach and Vivaldi

535
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:43,023
Classical, there's Mozart, Beethoven,

536
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,691
over there we have the most famous one.

537
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:21,690
Rain, Rain!

538
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:22,453
What's wrong?

539
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:23,562
I'm sorry!

540
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:28,693
Rain ran, Rain ran away!

541
00:49:36,044 --> 00:49:36,772
Where?

542
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:39,807
Rain ran away!

543
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:41,612
Jay!

544
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:46,644
Rain's mad!

545
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,365
Thank you!

546
00:50:50,051 --> 00:50:51,177
Excuse me!

547
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,465
Are you okay?

548
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:16,106
Yeah.

549
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:19,342
Don't you have anything to say to me?

550
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:29,280
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry.

551
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:04,951
Stop playing, you'll make me cry!

552
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:34,814
Dad, can you cut it out?

553
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,215
What?

554
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,318
Cut it out!

555
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,371
Cut it out, just leave me alone.

556
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
What's wrong?

557
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:56,336
Just tell Dad, okay?

558
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,978
Nothing!

559
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:09,985
You're my only son, I'm worried about you.

560
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,983
Tell me what's on your mind.

561
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:15,863
I'll go cook!

562
00:53:24,138 --> 00:53:26,038
Don't cook, it's a day off!

563
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,806
Let's eat out, okay?

564
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,034
What do you want?

565
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:46,392
Let's go out and eat!

566
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:52,861
Be happy!

567
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:18,357
Alright, alright! Who're you looking for?

568
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:19,750
I'm looking for Rain!

569
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:21,818
Not so loud!

570
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,526
She's resting, you'll disturb her.

571
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:28,825
Why isn't she in class?

572
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:31,934
She dropped out!

573
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:38,840
Her asthma's acting up and needs rest.

574
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:40,539
Then...

575
00:55:29,497 --> 00:55:30,464
Sky!

576
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:33,191
I'm sorry about last time.

577
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:35,831
It's okay, it's in the past.

578
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:18,200
After five months...

579
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:23,745
Okay, so these 2 starts to cave in.

580
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:25,213
They'll cave in from right here.

581
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:26,443
Then the two will connect.

582
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,918
Now think in 3 dimensions,

583
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:30,750
now there are 2 holes.

584
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,823
This one here is the mouth.

585
00:56:33,294 --> 00:56:34,318
Did you ride your bike today?

586
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:35,796
No.

587
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:41,066
Will you give me a ride
if you had the bike?

588
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,165
Sure.

589
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:47,806
Abalone? Is that abalone?

590
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:49,100
We don't have abalone.

591
00:56:49,977 --> 00:56:51,569
Why don't you just wait outside?

592
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,437
I've waited so long,

593
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:57,310
I'm hungry!

594
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:00,951
The usual, right?

595
00:57:01,155 --> 00:57:02,281
- Yeah! - Ok!

596
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,449
Ok, thanks!

597
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:05,147
How have you been?

598
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:06,082
I've been okay!

599
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,191
- Sure? - Yeah

600
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:08,622
- bye now! - Be careful!

601
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:09,818
Okay, bye!

602
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:19,238
Old pianos are hard to play.

603
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,105
Really?

604
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:25,479
You like to come here often.

605
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:29,782
I have a lot of memories here.

606
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:33,246
Too bad it'll be torn

607
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:34,918
down on graduation day.

608
00:57:36,323 --> 00:57:37,290
I know.

609
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,249
You're kind of mysterious.

610
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:42,720
Really?

611
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,392
You can tell me what's on your mind.

612
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:49,669
Okay.

613
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:56,466
Can I get a ride home after school?

614
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,581
Don't you have this album already?

615
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:45,722
Yeah.

616
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:18,521
Welcome to the 84th graduation ceremony

617
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:21,127
for TanJiang Art school.

618
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:23,657
Throughout this year,

619
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:26,327
watching outstanding graduates completing

620
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:28,831
this phase of their education.

621
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:30,870
Nervous?

622
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:32,228
A little.

623
00:59:32,439 --> 00:59:34,737
It'll bring good luck!

624
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:37,637
I'll give this back after the concert.

625
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:40,142
Okay, good luck!

626
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,624
Come sit!

627
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,178
Rain! Rain!

628
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,089
And don't disappear anymore, okay?

629
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:39,690
Okay!

630
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:00,036
What're you doing?

631
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:01,613
Wait for me in class!

632
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:06,711
You're a disgrace! Get back there!

633
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:09,556
Lunatic!

634
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:21,966
It really brought good luck!

635
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:23,659
What're you doing?

636
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:25,702
- Where did you go?
- It's over, now you come back?

637
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,027
What's with this class, a refugee camp?

638
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:54,723
There's nothing here?

639
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:57,870
They should get a grant,
only pens are rulers!

640
01:03:58,272 --> 01:03:59,603
Look at that!

641
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:00,638
What?

642
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,773
That!

643
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:06,306
Hello, Jay!

644
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:09,243
What're you doing?

645
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,675
Cleaning your classroom!

646
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:12,442
- A lot of good stuff!
- Don't say...

647
01:04:12,653 --> 01:04:13,984
we didn't take care of you!

648
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:17,156
Here, this is for you, don't forget us!

649
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:18,552
Let's go!

650
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:19,917
To the next room!

651
01:04:20,994 --> 01:04:22,359
Did you see a girl in my class?

652
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:25,932
Girl?

653
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:26,893
Who?

654
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:29,430
The one dancing with me at the party!

655
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:31,066
Dancing?

656
01:04:31,572 --> 01:04:32,766
Are you nuts?

657
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,702
You were dancing alone!

658
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:37,739
You totally stole my thunder!

659
01:04:41,515 --> 01:04:42,504
Why aren't you in class today?

660
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,042
I was practicing!

661
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:46,280
Someone missed class today!

662
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,417
I was practicing in the piano room!

663
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,155
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

664
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,023
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

665
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,122
The one dancing with me at the party!

666
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:59,328
You were dancing alone!

667
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:08,875
Next time you need a dance partner,
just ask me.

668
01:05:13,146 --> 01:05:13,942
What's your name?

669
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:17,015
I told you already.

670
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,878
I heard 4 hands playing,

671
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:20,578
but you're alone?

672
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,255
You students! Unbelievable!

673
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,049
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

674
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:41,305
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

675
01:06:24,685 --> 01:06:27,051
(I'm Rain!)

676
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,627
(Where are you?)

677
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:02,486
(I love you!)

678
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:32,279
(Do you love me?)

679
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,464
Granny!

680
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:56,876
Granny!

681
01:07:58,411 --> 01:07:59,309
Granny!

682
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,769
Anyone there?

683
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:01,978
Who're you looking for?

684
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,176
I'm looking for Rain, is she home?

685
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:10,085
The door's not locked, come in.

686
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:31,132
Try to be quiet,
Rain is listening to music.

687
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,596
Where did she go?

688
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:43,709
This is her favorite song.

689
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:52,247
One day, she told me:

690
01:09:53,393 --> 01:09:56,794
She met a boy who loves this song too!

691
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:21,016
Don't touch Rain's stuff!

692
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:46,043
Rain, Mom should've believed you!

693
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,178
What?

694
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:22,504
It was 1979,

695
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,149
Rain is a 3rd year student.

696
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:31,919
She plays the piano very well, and...

697
01:11:32,492 --> 01:11:35,222
she is a very talented student.

698
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:40,426
But, she was always daydreaming...

699
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:49,542
Rain.

700
01:11:51,945 --> 01:11:53,435
We've sat here for so long already,

701
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:58,008
can you tell me now why are you crying?

702
01:11:58,885 --> 01:12:00,113
I'm getting kind of tired.

703
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:07,788
Will you believe me?

704
01:12:09,062 --> 01:12:11,189
Of course I will.

705
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:14,293
I'm just afraid you don't trust me.

706
01:12:19,105 --> 01:12:21,699
Then I'll tell you a story, okay?

707
01:12:26,746 --> 01:12:27,804
One day...

708
01:12:49,736 --> 01:12:50,998
Secret...

709
01:12:59,612 --> 01:13:01,978
Follow the notes upon ajourney,

710
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,374
At first sight marks one's destiny.

711
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,285
Once the voyage comes to an end,

712
01:13:08,855 --> 01:13:13,849
Return lies within hasty keys.

713
01:15:07,106 --> 01:15:10,200
Because I want to see him at first sight,

714
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:12,609
Excuse me.

715
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:14,905
So only he can see me.

716
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:18,316
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

717
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:21,117
Excuse me!

718
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:22,719
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

719
01:15:36,769 --> 01:15:37,827
Now we will be learning

720
01:15:38,037 --> 01:15:40,096
a new formula.

721
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:43,271
Basically at the circumference,

722
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,804
and any value outside of it,

723
01:15:47,513 --> 01:15:48,775
there're 2 values for M,

724
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,041
if you can only find 1,

725
01:15:51,484 --> 01:15:52,678
that means...

726
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:16,770
Sorry I'm late.

727
01:16:18,845 --> 01:16:21,575
Why was he a musical genius?

728
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,441
We were in the same class,

729
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:29,417
Hey, pay attention in class!

730
01:16:29,622 --> 01:16:30,850
January 18th, 1999

731
01:16:31,057 --> 01:16:33,855
just that we're 20 years apart.

732
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:44,233
Stop!

733
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:52,575
97, 98, 99, 100, 101

734
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:57,842
102, 103, 104, 105

735
01:16:58,017 --> 01:16:59,678
Because I want to see him at first sight,

736
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:03,221
I counted the distance
from piano room to class,

737
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:06,184
It's 108 steps.

738
01:17:06,993 --> 01:17:09,860
B is augmented by 6 keys.

739
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:15,126
We are asked to find E...

740
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:18,468
But it was successful all the time.

741
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:33,041
I'll never forget how his back looks.

742
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,920
Those moments were hard to get!

743
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:57,575
York thought Rain was going back.

744
01:17:58,277 --> 01:18:00,609
No, I'm here to see Jay.

745
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:04,948
I've made you fail.

746
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,832
Sky is here.

747
01:18:51,197 --> 01:18:54,792
Rain! Rain!

748
01:18:56,803 --> 01:19:01,206
Rain's gone! She's going home!

749
01:19:32,638 --> 01:19:35,232
It could be...

750
01:19:37,009 --> 01:19:41,309
He has no taste, that's right!

751
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:45,346
That's how future boys are!

752
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:46,711
If I see him,

753
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:48,318
I'll slap him silly!

754
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:50,946
Naughty! Naughty!

755
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:52,449
York!

756
01:19:52,658 --> 01:19:53,386
Yes!

757
01:19:53,593 --> 01:19:56,460
That's too obvious,
it's no longer eavesdropping!

758
01:19:56,929 --> 01:19:58,260
Yes sir! I'll go sweep there!

759
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,592
Be careful, he's a pervert!

760
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,034
Rain...

761
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,438
He's just not worth it,

762
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,038
forget about him.

763
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:18,275
If anything bothers you,

764
01:20:18,484 --> 01:20:21,419
you can talk to me, okay?

765
01:20:36,736 --> 01:20:42,368
I won't go see him anymore.

766
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:49,181
Can you keep this for me?

767
01:20:54,987 --> 01:21:00,948
And one more thing,

768
01:21:02,361 --> 01:21:07,663
don't mention this to anyone else.

769
01:21:12,204 --> 01:21:15,264
Then can you keep this secret?

770
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:16,864
Of course!

771
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:29,710
Rain! Don't think so much!

772
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,966
We've been concerned about Rain.

773
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:47,529
So don't you worry,

774
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:52,007
Students, teachers,

775
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:55,374
The school really cares for her.

776
01:21:57,617 --> 01:22:02,247
Mostly, we need parents to help us out.

777
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:08,890
You're the head of the class.

778
01:22:09,862 --> 01:22:12,695
You should watch over her, understand?

779
01:22:17,336 --> 01:22:21,397
Don't tell other students about this!

780
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:42,992
(Lose your virginity
20 years in the future?)

781
01:23:02,381 --> 01:23:04,110
What's the point of being
such a good student?

782
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:07,751
It's a shame she's messed up!

783
01:23:08,054 --> 01:23:10,488
That's beauty that's wasted!

784
01:23:10,756 --> 01:23:14,419
Let's talk about
what the graduation performance.

785
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:16,456
We can just ask Rain to do it!

786
01:23:16,796 --> 01:23:20,095
Do what?
Travel through time to look for love?

787
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,895
Alright, stop messing with her!

788
01:23:32,144 --> 01:23:33,543
What? Can't take ajoke?

789
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,474
Don't pick on her!

790
01:23:39,151 --> 01:23:40,675
Go do your garbage!

791
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:44,790
Rain?

792
01:24:08,514 --> 01:24:11,210
Rain, you're really not going to class?

793
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:28,491
Take some medication then,
I'll leave them here.

794
01:24:51,524 --> 01:24:55,688
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

795
01:25:55,754 --> 01:25:56,812
Who is he?

796
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:00,816
He's the boy I told you about!

797
01:26:05,197 --> 01:26:07,563
How does Mom look in 20 years?

798
01:26:13,105 --> 01:26:17,405
The locks were changed, I couldn't get in.

799
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:24,314
But Mom is probably as beautiful.

800
01:26:36,996 --> 01:26:37,985
It's all your fault!

801
01:26:38,864 --> 01:26:42,595
Saying that music
will make her more elegant!

802
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:47,704
Look at how sick she is!

803
01:26:50,042 --> 01:26:54,604
What will we do?

804
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,520
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

805
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:14,097
Rain, I'll get you some water.

806
01:27:24,977 --> 01:27:26,604
Did she mention that boy?

807
01:27:26,845 --> 01:27:29,973
Yes, thank you for visiting her.

808
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,781
She'll be really happy to see you.

809
01:27:33,419 --> 01:27:35,046
It's the graduation ceremony today,

810
01:27:35,254 --> 01:27:36,619
I hope she can be there.

811
01:27:37,423 --> 01:27:38,219
I'll get her.

812
01:27:50,135 --> 01:27:52,467
Rain, look who's here?

813
01:27:53,339 --> 01:27:56,103
Rain, it's graduation day.

814
01:27:56,475 --> 01:27:59,467
I wish you can come, okay?

815
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,238
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

816
01:28:03,215 --> 01:28:04,182
When?

817
01:28:04,717 --> 01:28:05,615
Graduation day!

818
01:28:06,085 --> 01:28:07,347
I'll play for you!

819
01:28:15,694 --> 01:28:17,525
Look who's back!

820
01:28:23,902 --> 01:28:25,267
Take a picture for me and Rain.

821
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:29,704
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

822
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:31,733
But things didn't turn out

823
01:28:34,146 --> 01:28:35,545
like I expected.

824
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:39,582
Me too!

825
01:28:40,786 --> 01:28:42,378
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

826
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:44,337
What're you doing?

827
01:29:46,518 --> 01:29:47,450
Wait for me in class!

828
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:54,387
Gift from your boyfriend?

829
01:29:54,593 --> 01:29:55,685
I don't have a boyfriend.

830
01:32:38,924 --> 01:32:40,721
That was our last picture together.

831
01:32:42,928 --> 01:32:48,025
Why do you ask? Have you heard of her?

832
01:32:53,672 --> 01:32:54,832
Oh and...

833
01:33:20,832 --> 01:33:21,958
Jay?

834
01:33:25,237 --> 01:33:26,704
Don't play this in the old piano room.

835
01:33:27,739 --> 01:33:28,637
Why?

836
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:30,565
It sounds bad on the old piano.

837
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:56,259
Ready over there?

838
01:33:57,736 --> 01:33:59,363
Yeah!

839
01:33:59,638 --> 01:34:02,266
Hurry up! Boss is rushing!

840
01:34:02,474 --> 01:34:04,032
No one left?

841
01:34:10,115 --> 01:34:10,877
Sure?

842
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:13,574
I've checked a million times!

843
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,081
What about the piano?

844
01:34:17,456 --> 01:34:19,481
The principal said they'll get new ones!

845
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:46,082
Start here!

846
01:34:46,284 --> 01:34:48,081
Come over here!

847
01:35:37,269 --> 01:35:38,258
Do you have to play so fast?

848
01:35:39,404 --> 01:35:40,871
That's how fast I play before I go home.

849
01:35:41,506 --> 01:35:44,600
(Return lies within hasty keys.)

850
01:36:10,902 --> 01:36:11,732
(Even if we'll never see each other gain,)

851
01:36:11,937 --> 01:36:12,904
(even if you forget me,)

852
01:36:13,104 --> 01:36:14,162
