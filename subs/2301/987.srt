2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,751
今晚，我吃了一颗大白菜
Tonight, I eat a cabbage,

3
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:16,751
詹姆斯把一只鸽子扔出了车窗
James throws a bird out of a car

4
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:19,751
理查德忘记了美国的缩写是什么
and Richard forgets the abbreviation for America.

5
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:20,752
USB。
USB.

6
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:31,751
各位小伙伴晚上好！谢谢捧场
Hello, everybody! Good evening.Thank you so much.

7
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:33,751
谢谢大家。好的
Thank you, everybody. Now,

8
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:39,751
今天我们先从丹麦说起，因为
I want to start by talking about Denmark because, you see,

9
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:43,751
这么多年来，这个小小的国家
over the years, this tiny little country has contributed

10
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,751
为世界贡献了太多宝贵东西
so much to the betterment of mankind.

11
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:50,751
它为我们提供了漂亮的家具，高品质的音响设备
It's given us interesting furniture,stylish hi-fi,

12
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:54,751
有意思的儿童玩具，当然，还有这个
amusing children's toys and, of course, this.

13
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:58,751
抹着丹麦黄油的丹麦培根三明治
Danish bacon, Danish butter,wrapped in bread,

14
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,751
这是治疗素食主义者的
to create the only known cure

15
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:03,752
最好良方
for vegetarianism.

16
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:09,752
但是丹麦，从未造过一辆汽车...直到今天
Denmark, however,has never made a car... until now.

17
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,751
丹麦的人均风能占有率
Because Denmark has more windmills per head

18
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,751
居世界第一
than any other country on Earth

19
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,751
并且哥本哈根是个自行车天堂
and because Copenhagen is a cyclist's paradise,

20
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:23,752
所以你很容易猜到他们造出来的车会是啥样
you know exactly what sort of car it's going to be.

21
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:31,752
没错，好吧，其实不像你想的那样
Yeah, well, it isn't.

22
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:42,751
我也曾猜测这车会不会像安徒生脸上长着一副雨刷
I was also expecting Hans Christian Andersen with windscreen wipers

23
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,752
或者小美人鱼长着门把手，但我错了
or The Little Mermaid with door handles, but no.

24
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,752
实际上这车是这样的
What we've got instead is this.

25
00:01:55,752 --> 00:02:00,752
一辆1086马力的橙色猛兽！
A 1,086 horsepower orange monster!

26
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:08,752
它叫Zenvo ST1，速度奇快无比
It's called the Zenvo ST1 and it is extremely fast.

27
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:15,752
搭载了一台6.8升V8引擎
It's got a 6.8 litre V8

28
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:22,752
同时还有一对机械加涡轮的双增压系统
which is supercharged AND turbocharged.

29
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:28,751
这就像哈瓦那辣椒上抹芥末酱
And that's like smearing a habanero chilli with wasabi

30
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,752
再把它们塞进炸药里
and then garnishing it with dynamite.

31
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,752
结果就是这车的速度快得连仪表都跟不上了
The net result is a speedometer that can't keep up.

32
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:41,752
指针飞转。138英里（222公里）150英里（241公里）
170英里（273公里）还在增长
It's just a blur.138, 150, 170-something

33
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:46,752
我的天！太快了！
My God! No, no idea!

34
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:53,752
显然油门见底的速度能达到233英里每小时（374公里）
Apparently, however, flat out,it will do 233mph.

35
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:04,751
各位知道北欧犯罪悬疑剧里
You know those Scandinavian crime dramas,

36
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:09,752
那些穿着背带衫倚窗发呆的人吗？
lots of quietly thoughtful people in jumpers looking out of the window?

37
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:16,751
这车和他们毫无类似。
This is nothing like that.Nothing at all.

38
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:20,751
这是辆货真价实的超级跑车
So, it is very definitely a supercar.

39
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,751
但因此也引出些问题
And that's a problem

40
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,751
谁会这么说，不，我不想买法拉利
because who's going to say,"No, I don't want a Ferrari

41
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:29,751
不想买兰博基尼、帕加尼和布加迪
or a Lamborghini or a Pagani or a Bugatti

42
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,751
也不想保时捷、奥迪R8、迈凯轮以及阿斯顿马丁
or a Porsche or an Audi R8 or a McLaren or an Aston Martin

43
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:37,751
我想买辆出自一家连名字都没听说过的
I would rather spend my money on something totally unproven,

44
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:41,751
小公司生产的跑车？
preferably from a company I've never heard of?  

45
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,752
我意思是，凭啥买它？
I mean, why would you do that?

46
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:50,751
这车也没有那种天使般的做工
It's not like the engine is made from the tears of an angel

47
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,751
以及天神一样的操控性
by the gods of science and precision.

48
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:56,751
更何况它的悬挂系统非常传统
What's more,it has conventional suspension

49
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,752
底盘也是死沉的钢制结构
and a heavy, steel chassis.

50
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:04,751
不过，正是由于这些老气的设计
However, because it's a bit last-week, you can

51
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,752
你能在它身上体验到那种久违的驾驶乐趣
have some old-fashioned fun in the corners.

52
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:15,751
哦嚯嚯！
Oh-ho-ho!

53
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,752
但有时你也会玩脱手
But you can also have an accident.'

54
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:29,751
一部分原因是如果你启动运动或者赛道模式
Part of the problem is that if you engage sport or race mode,

55
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,751
牵引力控制系统就会彻底关闭
the traction control is disengaged.

56
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,751
现在，这辆车，按照 - 喔 - 设计它的工程师说法
Now, this, according to the - oops - chief engineer,

57
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,752
变得更难驾驭
makes it pretty much undrivable

58
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,751
他是对的
He's right.

59
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,752
他说的没错
He is right.

60
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,751
这车的可靠性同样值得怀疑
There were also some issues with quality.

61
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:12,751
车灯内会产生凝结
The lights filled with condensation,

62
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:15,751
后刹车经常出问题
the rear brakes didn't seem to be working properly,

63
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:17,751
接着离合器也失效了
then the clutch went.

64
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,752
所以我们只能把车运回丹麦处理
So the car had to go back to Denmark.

65
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:25,751
几周后，它被修好了
After a couple of weeks,however, it was mended,

66
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:27,752
所以Zenvo重回赛道
so the Zenvo came back.

67
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,751
但几乎同时...
But almost immediately...

68
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:42,751
一个散热风扇出了故障
a cooling fan went wrong.

69
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,751
火警，火警，火警！收到
Fire, fire, fire! Copy that.

70
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:47,752
就这样，这车变得更显火热
So the car became even more orange.

71
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,752
于是，我们的评测也到此为止
And that was the end of that.

72
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,751
不尽如人意
That didn't do very well.

73
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,751
这货卖多少钱？你说价格？嗯.
How much is this thing? How much? Mm.

74
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,752
80万英镑。80万？！（814万人民币）
£800000. 800?!

75
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:18,751
没错。这玩意有什么优点吗？呃，优点，有
Yes. Are there any upsides to it? Er, upsides, yes.

76
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:22,752
大火把车灯内的水雾烤干了
The fire did get rid of the condensation in the lights.

77
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,751
除这以外呢？除这以外...
Apart from the fire? Apart from the fire...

78
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,751
还有，它表现的非常舒适安静
Yes, it's surprisingly comfortable and very quiet.

79
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,751
好吧，它都已经挂了，自然很安静
Well, it would be quiet.It was broken.

80
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:36,751
是的，但神奇的是，厂方又把它修好送了回来
Yes, but amazingly, they have mended it again and it's back again.

81
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:40,751
现在要看看它在我们赛道表现如何
And now we can find out how fast it does a lap of our track,

82
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:45,751
或者说它如果能完好的跑完一圈
or rather IF it can do a lap of our track.

83
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:49,751
也就是说又到了请出我们圈养车手的时刻
That, of course, means handing it over to our tame racing driver

84
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:54,752
据说这周他穿了两层防火服以备不测
Some say that this week he is wearing two layers of Nomex.

85
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,751
并且在最近一次前往康沃尔的旅途中
And that on a recent trip to Cornwall,

86
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:07,752
他在萨默塞特郡路边草丛里方便被人发现
he stopped off for one of his special big wees in Somerset.

87
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,752
大家都知道他就是Stig！
All we know is he's called The Stig!

88
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:14,751
起步！
And he's off!

89
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:18,751
小心翼翼的起步，因为赛道很湿滑
Cautious start because it is soaking out there today.

90
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:22,751
着火之后看起来更加艳丽动人。好的，进入第一弯
Be beautiful, though, if it catches fire. Right, first corner.

91
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:25,752
会出故障吗？目前为止安然无恙
Will it try to bite him? Nothing so far.

92
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,752
噢，不，等等，出弯有点不稳
Oh, no, wait, there is a bit of a nibble at the end.

93
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:38,751
完全不知道他听的是啥
Absolutely no idea what The Stig is listening to.

94
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:42,752
但我知道，他开启的是赛道模式。没有牵引力控制
I do know, however, he is in full race mode. No traction control

95
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,751
这个弯很小心
He is being cautious, though.

96
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,751
好的，穿过榔头弯
Right, through the Hammerhead.

97
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,751
噢，不，又有些甩尾，但他控制住了
Oh, no, it's stepped out again,but he has managed to hold it.

98
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:53,752
天啊，技术真不错！
God, that is very good driving!

99
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,751
好的，他会松油门吗？
Right, is he going to lift?

100
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:04,751
噢，是的，油门放了一点
Oh, yes, he is going to lift

101
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,751
因为这车就和丹麦首相一样活泼
because that thing is as racy as the Danish Prime Minister.

102
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,751
穿过轮胎墙
Through the tyres.

103
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:12,751
还剩两个弯
Only two corners left.

104
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:16,751
你能清楚的看到这车过弯时的摆动
You can actually see it squirming on the lake where our track used to be.

105
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:20,751
过了最后的Gambon弯就能松口气了。它能完成吗？
Only Gambon left before he can have a lie down. Is he going to make it?

106
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,751
能做到吗？
Is IT going to make it?

107
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,752
是的，它完成了！
Yes, it has!

108
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:26,751
好的...
Now...

109
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:27,751
成绩在我这里
I have the time here.

110
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:33,752
记住，这是辆价值80万英镑，1000马力的跑车，让我们瞧瞧
Remember, it is an £800,000 1,000 horsepower car, so here we go.

111
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:36,751
哦...
Ohhh...

112
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,751
不，还要低些。是吗？
No, it's a bit lower. Really?

113
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,751
哦...
Ohhh...

114
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,751
噢-不！
Oh-ho!

115
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:46,751
就是这里，1分29秒9
There you go, it's 1.29.9,

116
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,752
比一辆福克斯还慢
slower than a Ford Focus.

117
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:53,751
不，不，等等。抱歉，等等
No, no, hang on a minute.I'm sorry. Hang on a minute.

118
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:56,751
让我们公正点评价它。我们找个另外的湿圈
Let's be fair about it. We need to look at another time for a wet lap.

119
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:00,751
就是这个。它比一辆德国房车还慢。是的！
There you go. It's slower than a German saloon car. It is!

120
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:06,751
各位知道这是一辆橙色的丹麦货，并且天生就有个缺陷
You know this is Danish and it s orange and it's genetically flawed

121
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,751
我很惊讶他们没有管它叫长颈鹿...
I'm surprised they haven't called The Giraffe...

122
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:12,752
并且给它来一枪
（最近日德兰动物园一头名为“马里乌斯”的
长颈鹿死刑问题引起欧洲广泛舆论）
and shot it.

123
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,751
他说的很大声，是吗？他确实这么说了
He said that out loud,didn't he? He did.

124
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:16,751
他居然说这事
He said it out loud.

125
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,751
假装没听见，让我们进入新闻环节
Never mind,let's move on with the news

126
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:20,751
好的，我要说的本周新闻，显然
and, well,my big news this week, certainly

127
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:23,751
就是上周我驾驶了保时捷918
is I spent last weekend driving the new Porsche 918.

128
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:26,751
噢，你真的做了！以后的节目里我们会放给大家看。就是这货
Oh, you did! It'll be on the show later in the series. There it is.

129
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:29,751
好的，快点，快点，先给大家说说。这车如何？
Come on, quick, quick, now,sneak preview. What is it like?

130
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,752
好的，詹妮弗...
Well, Jennifer...

131
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,751
有你的！
Funny!

132
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,751
是的，如果各位看了上周的节目，杰瑞米说了
Yeah, if you were watching last week,Jeremy did say on the show,

133
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,751
就在电视上，如果保时捷918比迈凯轮P1快
on TV, that if the Porsche was faster than the McLaren,

134
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,751
他会改名叫詹妮弗。是的
he would change his name to Jennifer.Yes.

135
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,751
对吧，詹妮弗？但是，它做不到。跟你讲，我感觉918是这样的
Didn't you, Jennifer? Well, it won't be. See, I think it might just be.

136
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,751
说实话，这车...快的让人胆颤
Honestly, it... It's staggering Really.

137
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,751
它的加速感不像其它车那样
It doesn't accelerate like most other cars.

138
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:53,751
你不会觉得它的加速
You are not conscious of it

139
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,751
是伴着转速提升而逐渐提高的
gaining speed through the gear as the revs rise.

140
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,751
它不像这样加速“噢 - 啊！”
It doesn't go, "Ohhh-aaahhh!"

141
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,751
它的速度直接像这样“啊啊啊啊！”
It just goes straight to, "Aaaaargh!"

142
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:01,751
但是，哈蒙德...什么？
But, Hammond... What?

143
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,751
迈凯轮比保时捷的动力更强
the McLaren has more power than the Porsche

144
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,751
体重更轻。我知道
and is lighter than the Porsche。I know.

145
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:11,751
但是听着，詹妮弗，保时捷有四轮驱动系统
But listen, Jennifer,the Porsche has four-wheel-drive

146
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,751
以及四轮转向系统，并且在我们赛道上的表现...
and four-wheel steer and on our track...

147
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,751
它会输给迈凯轮
It will lose.

148
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,751
听着，我承认纳粹空军飞行员对他们的
Listen, I'm sure the Luftwaffe were very proud

149
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:20,751
梅塞施密特109战斗机非常骄傲和自豪
and pleased with the Messerschmitt Me 109.

150
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:24,751
那是种很优秀的战斗机。是的，但它没有...
That was a damn good aeroplane.Yes, but it wasn't...

151
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,751
它没有喷火式战斗机优秀！
It wasn't as good as the Spitfire!

152
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,751
不，梅塞施密特109能做负过载机动动作
No, you could do negative G in the Messerschmitt 109.

153
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:34,751
梅，你怎么和他一样讨厌！我会让它会输得很难看
May, you are as bad as he is! That is going to be humiliated.

154
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:39,751
我们会赢得胜利。我说“我们”，指的是我们英国...
We are going to win. When I say we,Britain is going to...

155
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:41,751
我们都是爱国人士，那没错
I'm all for patriotism,that's great,

156
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,751
但你必须面对事实。这车很棒
but you've just got to face facts.The thing is astonishing.

157
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,751
它的精髓在于如何控制三台引擎一起...给我闭嘴！
It's about how it manages those three engines... Shut up about it!

158
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,751
我赞同你的爱国情怀
I'm with you about the British thing,

159
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:53,752
但我同样希望保时捷能赢，詹妮弗
but I sort of hope the Porsche wins, JENNIFER.

160
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,751
不管怎样，最近新闻里充斥着各种洪水之后
Anyway look，The news has been filled with a lot of scenes

161
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:58,751
灾民冲镜头挥手求援的场面
of flood victims all waving their arms around

162
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:00,751
“噢，不，我们该怎么办？”
and going, "Oh, no,what are we going to do?"

163
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,751
就像世界末日一样
End of the world really.

164
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:05,751
这场面让我很失望，因为解决的方法
I mean, it certainly makes me very sad because the answer,

165
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,751
非常简单
as we all know, is simple.

166
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,751
你买辆福特全顺，在地板上挖个大洞
You buy a Ford transit van,cut a big hole in the floor,

167
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:14,751
卸掉后门，放个引擎进去，加上风扇，裙边
take the back doors off, couple of engines in it, fans, skirts,

168
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,751
然后开到水上，这样它就沉了。没错
put it in the water, it sinks.That's true.

169
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,751
之后你再买辆全顺，弄台更大的引擎
You get another transit van,more powerful engines,

170
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,752
一番大改。就像这样
totally redesigned. Here we go.

171
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,751
表现完美。这就是解决方案
And it works perfectly.That is the solution.

172
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,751
我们六个月前就预测到了这场洪水并且给出了解决方案
We predicted these floods six months ago and came up with the solution.

173
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,751
但令我们失望的是每个人
But what is really annoying is that everybody

174
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,751
都在抱怨戴维·卡梅伦（英国首相），环境署
is blaming the floods on David Cameron, the Environment Agency

175
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:38,751
以及更多你可以抱怨的对象...
pretty much anything you can name...

176
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:41,751
恩，我知道谁最应该
Mm-mm, I know exactly who is to blame

177
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,751
对这种情况负责
for this problem everybody is having.

178
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,752
米兰达·哈特（英国演员、作家、喜剧演员）
Miranda Hart.

179
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:49,751
你们都笑了，但事实是
You laugh, but here's the thing

180
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,751
虽然每周日晚上我们坐这陪着各位
We are sitting here now on a Sunday evening.

181
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,751
可还是有8、9百万英国人选择观看
Eight, nine million people in Britain have chosen to watch

182
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:58,751
另一个频道的1950年助产教学片
some 1950s midwifery on the other side,

183
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,751
以至于他们从没说过我们的气垫车
so they don't know about the hover-van.

184
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:01,751
这是个问题
That is the problem.

185
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:05,751
他们宁愿看米兰达也不看我们的节目，
They have chosen Miranda over us and our show is

186
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:09,752
即使我们节目充满了各种有用的小贴士和消费建议。每周如此！
rammed full of helpful hints and useful consumer advice. Every week!

187
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,751
换个话题，嘿，盖拉多已经生产多久了
Now, hey, listen, how long has the Gallardo been in production

188
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,751
有17000年历史了吧？有了？有了
17,000 years? Just over? Just over.

189
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,751
我知道它们在史前文明时就已经在产了。是的
I know there are cave drawings of it in the Pyrenees. There are.

190
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,751
如今兰博基尼宣布他们将停产盖拉多
Well, Lamborghini has announced they are stopping making it

191
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:24,751
并发布全新换代车型。它叫“胡拉坎”（飓风）
and are going to replace it with this. It's called the Huracan.

192
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:27,751
600马力，5.2升排量V10引擎，四轮驱动
600 horsepower, 5.2 litre V10,four-wheel-drive.

193
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,751
没任何新鲜玩意
None of that is interesting

194
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:32,751
因为如果你痴迷于速度、马力、操控感
because if you're interested in speed and power and handling,

195
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,751
你会选择法拉利458或者迈凯轮12C，对吧？
you're going to buy a Ferrari 458 or a McLaren 12C, aren't you?

196
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:39,751
而选择兰博基尼的唯一理由是它们看起来很疯狂
The only reason you want to buy a Lamborghini is because it looks mad.

197
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:42,751
虽然这车看起来疯狂，但我认为它疯狂的还不够
And that's very nice, but I don t think it's bonkers enough.

198
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,751
我明白你的意思。它看起来很漂亮，但是...
I know what you mean.It looks nice, but...

199
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,751
是的，它还要长得更疯狂。是的
Yeah, it needs to be outrageous.It does.

200
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:49,751
如果一个人没喝下两大瓶苦艾酒
Nobody should be allowed to design a Lamborghini

201
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:53,751
他就没资格担任兰博基尼设计师
unless they've just consumed two bottles of absinthe.

202
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:54,751
像这样！
Now you're ready!

203
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:55,751
这里面的精髓是
The essence of it is,

204
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:58,751
一辆兰博基尼不在于它的驾驶感如何
it doesn't really matter how a Lamborghini drives

205
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:01,751
因为兰博基尼是用来在城市里招摇过市的
because a Lamborghini is for prowling around the city

206
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:05,751
法拉利是用来在银石赛道刷圈速的
Ferraris are for doing a 2.35 around Silverstone.

207
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,751
兰博基尼适合徘徊于凌晨2点35的骑士桥附近
（骑士桥：伦敦市中心西部繁华商业街）
Lamborghinis are for doing Knightsbridge at 2.35am.

208
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,751
是的，是的
Yes, yes.

209
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:15,751
最近，政府正为一种新的气体头疼
Now, there's a new type of gas which is worrying the government.

210
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,751
是氰化物？不。二氧化碳吗？
Is it cyanide? No.Is it carbon dioxide?

211
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,751
不，曾经是二氧化碳。怎么说呢
No, it used to be carbon dioxide.Now the days where

212
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,751
我都难以启齿
I can hardly bring myself to say this.

213
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,751
他们担心的是氮氧混合气
They are very worried about a terrifying new combination of nitrogen and oxygen.

214
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,751
什么，你是说空气？是的
What, you mean air? Yes.

215
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,751
空气99%成分是由这两种气体构成
99% of the air that we breathe is nitrogen and oxygen,

216
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:36,751
但政府有关部门现在为这点破事瞎操心
but the government has got his knickers in a twist about it,

217
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:40,751
尤其是氮氧化物，我事先补了点化学知识
specifically about nitrogen dioxide and I've done some checking.

218
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:41,999
抱歉
Bear with me on this.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,751
它们大多来自土壤、锅炉
It mostly comes from soil or stoves

220
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:49,751
以及柴油车在市中心行驶的工况排放，知道吗？
or particularly from lorries in stop-start city driving, OK?

221
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:52,751
所以政府决定解决这个问题
So the government has decided to address the problem

222
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:58,751
他们把谢菲尔德市旁的M1公路限速降到60英里
(英格兰南约克郡城市)
by limiting cars to 60mph on the M1 just outside Sheffield.

223
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:01,751
这就是他们的解决办法。但这和减排毫无关系！
That's their solution.But that's got nothing to do with it!

224
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:03,751
就像说“我牙痛
Isn't that like saying,"I've got toothache,

225
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,751
我要去理个发，那样牙就不痛了”
I think I'll go and have a hair cut. That will sort it."

226
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,751
大夫，我扭伤了脚。你得穿上件小马甲
Doctor, I've twisted my ankle."You must put on a bomber jacket"

227
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:11,751
实际上，有关部门表示“这是整个欧洲的法规，
The thing is, they actually say "Well, it's as European law,

228
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:12,751
所以我们必须限速”
so we have to lower the speed limit."

229
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:16,751
德国不这么干，法国不这么干，
意大利也不这么干，只有英国这么做
Germans aren't, French aren't,Italians aren't, only we are.

230
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,751
我知道究竟怎么回事了
And I know exactly what's happened here.

231
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,752
政府里有些这样的人，你懂的...
You've got some guy in the government, you know...

232
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:23,751
你知道那种类型。噢，是的，没错
You know the type. Oh, yes, right.

233
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:27,751
OK，现在，他有权利降低限速
OK, now, he has the power to lower the speed limit

234
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,751
禁止车内有儿童时父母不准吃三明治
and stop parents eating sandwiches in cars if kids are present,

235
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:34,751
但他真需要做的事情是行使女王的权利
but what he needs to do is take a leaf out of the Queen's book.

236
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:37,751
什么，嫁给希腊人？不！
What, marry a Greek? No!

237
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,751
宪法赋予女王
The Queen has the constitutional power

238
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:40,751
对他国宣战的权利
to declare war on another country,

239
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,751
但她从没用过
but she never does.

240
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,751
甚至一场派对结束之后她有点...
Even after a big party where she's a bit...

241
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,751
所有伙伴都怂恿她
and all her mates are egging her on.

242
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,751
上啊，莉兹！去宣战！她真会那么做吗？
Go on, Liz! Declare war on someone!" Can she really do that?

243
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:52,751
是啊，她有权利那么干，但从未做过。
“哈罗，是奥朗德（法国总统）阁下吗？
Yes, she can do that, but she doesn't. "Hello is that Mr Hollande?

244
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:56,751
我是英国女王。我们正处于战争时期！”
我每周都这么干！
"This is the Queen. WE ARE AT WAR!"I'd do that every week!

245
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:59,751
她能这么干。我都会这么干...我会每天都...
She could do that. I'd be constant... I'd do it every...

246
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:00,751
噢，天啊，我都干了些什么？
Oh, God, what have I done?"

247
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:02,752
没错，我想成为喝醉酒的女王！
Yeah, I would love to be a drunk Queen!

248
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,751
我意思是...
I didn't mean...

249
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:11,751
继续下个话题好吗？好的。好的
Shall we move it on? Yes. Yes.

250
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:15,751
每周，我们都收到数千封观众来信
Every week, we receive thousands of letters from people that say

251
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:19,751
他们说“亲爱的TopGear节目组，为什么你们从不测试些
Dear Top so-called Gear,why do you never test the sort of

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,751
普通人买得起的车呢？”
affordable cars that normal people are likely to buy and drive?"

253
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:27,751
好吧，实际上，我们想这么做。但制片人不让
Well, the truth is, we would love to. But the producers won't let us.

254
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:31,751
让人挺遗憾，因为和大多数人一样
It's frustrating,because contrary to public opinion,

255
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:34,751
我们很喜欢小巧、方便的小型车
we really do like small,sensible little cars.

256
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:37,751
他家有一辆菲亚特熊猫。我家有一辆菲亚特500
I mean, he has a Fiat Panda.I have a Fiat 500.

257
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:40,752
是的，我则有一辆小巧的梅赛德斯AMG
Yeah, and I have a very small AMG Mercedes.

258
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:43,751
已经很小了
Very small indeed.

259
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,751
我们喜欢小车的易于泊车，使用成本低廉
We like the way that small cars are easy to park and cheap to run,

260
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:49,751
但最重要的是，我们都喜欢
but, most of all,we like the way that a lot of them

261
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:51,751
它们的驾驶乐趣
are very good fun to drive.

262
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,751
但制片人却不这么认为，他们说这些车都很无趣
But the producers say they aren t,they say they're boring.

263
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:58,751
为了证明这点，他们发起了一次挑战
And to prove their point,they came up with a challenge.

264
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:03,751
是的，他们让我们挑选三辆1升排量，三缸引擎
Yes, they told us to choose three one-litre, three-cylinder,

265
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:09,752
小型家用车去克里米亚半岛接受挑战
little city cars and report with them to the Crimean peninsula.

266
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:15,751
所以、就是这里，乌克兰南部
So, here it is,at the bottom end of Ukraine,

267
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,752
伸进黑海的这片土地
jutting out into the Black Sea.

268
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:26,751
克里米亚半岛，
一万平方英里（25888平方公里）历史热土，充满了甜菜根
The Crimean peninsula, 10,000 square miles of history, beetroot

269
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,752
以及各种完爆西方女孩的漂亮妹纸们
and girls who leave the West behind.

270
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:33,751
这里就是我们集合的地点，雅尔塔
And this is where we were to meet,the city of Yalta.

271
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:37,751
希特勒战败后，就在这幢建筑物外
Outside the very building where Churchill, Stalin

272
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:41,752
丘吉尔，斯大林和罗斯福共同瓜分了欧洲大陆
and Roosevelt met to carve up Europe after Hitler's defeat.

273
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,751
哈蒙德第一个抵达
Hammond was the first to arrive

274
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,752
如各位所见，我选了一辆福特嘉年华
I have brought,as you can see, a Fiesta.

275
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:54,751
一辆在任何方面都很优秀的小车
Which is a very, very good small car in any case,

276
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,751
尤其在此时，它显得更加优秀
but in this instance,particularly good,

277
00:16:56,752 --> 00:17:00,751
因为它搭载了一台精致至极的引擎
because this one is fitted with an absolute jewel of an engine.

278
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:03,751
这台引擎十分小巧，1升，3缸，带涡轮缸内直喷技术
It's a tiny, one-litre,three-cylinder EcoBoost,

279
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,751
注意我的措辞，我意思是它十分小巧
and when I say tiny,I mean REALLY tiny.

280
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:10,751
整部引擎的面积可以用一张A4纸完全覆盖
The block of that engine would fit on an A4 piece of paper.

281
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:13,752
让人惊叹.好了，那是谁？
And it's magnificent.Right, who's that?

282
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,752
噢，是那个猩猩。没错
Oh, it's the orang-utan. Here we go.

283
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,751
恭喜。什么，恭喜啥？
Congratulations. What, why?

284
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:27,751
因为你这辆车是所有1升车里最棒的一辆
Because that is unquestionably the best one-litre little car of them all.

285
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:31,751
毫无疑问。它的引擎是...是的
No doubt about it.The engine in this... Yeah.

286
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:36,751
让人赞叹。125马力，仅仅1升排量.我知道！
It is phenomenal. 125 horsepower,from one litre. I know!

287
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,751
每加仑油能跑65英里（百公里3.6升）。真的是...
And 65 miles to the gallon.Honestly...

288
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,751
为啥老是说我的车，又为啥你不选这辆车呢？
Why are you saying these things and why, then, are you not in one?

289
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,752
为什么你选了那辆大众？这是辆大众Up！
Why are you in that VW? It's the Up!

290
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:49,751
我选这辆车因为我喜欢它。等等，你的逻辑有点...
Well, I brought this because I like it. Hang on, you've just ..

291
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:54,751
不，我喜欢这车。虽然你的车很棒。但我喜欢这辆
No, I like it. This is brilliant.But I like this.

292
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:55,751
让我这么给你解释，哈蒙德
Let me put it to you this way，Hammond

293
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:59,751
你能买只比我的西高地白梗
（宠物犬种，原产苏格兰）更好的宠物狗
You can buy better dogs than my West Highland terrier,

294
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:01,751
但我喜欢自己的狗
but I LIKE my West Highland terrier.

295
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:04,751
没错，它会咬人，在家里到处埋地雷
Yes, it bites the postman and it lays dog eggs all over

296
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:08,751
还经常偷吃食物，但它们很有爱！它们会这样...
the kitchen and it steals food but it's brilliant! And it goes ..

297
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,751
如果这车也有耳朵，它就会像这样...
If this had ears,it would go like that...

298
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:14,751
可惜，就在我兴致勃勃的扮演宠物狗时
Sadly, at this point,my dog impersonation was

299
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:17,751
船长大人姗姗来迟
interrupted by the arrival of Captain Interesting.'

300
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:21,751
这是我见过最无趣的车...这是辆什么车？看得我都快睡着了！
That's the most boring looking car I've... What is it? I'm nodding off!

301
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:28,751
好消息！什么？这是辆达契亚Sandero。是嘛？是的
Good news! What? It's a Dacia Sandero. Is it? Yes.

302
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:31,751
不论如何，你来之前我们讨论好久了
Anyway, we were just saying before you got here,

303
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,751
这是辆很棒的小车
this is just an epic little car

304
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:37,751
它很贵吧，对吗？它卖多少钱？17500英镑（177500人民币）
It's quite expensive, though,isn't it? How much is it? 17,500.

305
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:42,751
17500英镑？是的。你的车多少钱？7500英镑（76128人民币）
£17,500? Yup.And how much is yours? 7,500.

306
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:45,751
真是价格的鸿沟啊，哈蒙德。是的...
That's a big price gulf,Hammond. It is...

307
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,751
我能再去买一辆
I can afford to lose this and just go and buy another one

308
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,751
并且钱包仍有余钱。看看它！真是...它看上去很好
and I'm still better off than you.Look at it! It's... It looks great.

309
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:55,751
这车很低调，它是为那些精打细算的人打造的
It's anti-fashion, it's a car for people with more sense than money.

310
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,751
它使用正常，价格合理。哇奥，他们怎么把车做的这么便宜？
It works, it's cheap. Wow,how have they done it so cheaply?

311
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,751
你都想象不到，不是吗？显然一点...真是奇葩！
You can't work it out, can you? There is no obvious... It's amazing!

312
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:04,751
瞧这方向盘，糟糕的装配工艺！
That steering wheel,what a quality item!

313
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:08,751
和你的车没区别！完全不一样！形状类似
That's exactly the same as yours! It isn't the same! It's the same SHAPE.

314
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,751
如果我说的不对请纠正我，这货其实是30年前的雷诺克里奥
And correct me if I'm wrong,it was a Renault Clio 30 years ago.

315
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:12,751
不是30年前
Not 30 years ago.

316
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:17,751
它只是以老款雷诺克里奥为基础而已
It's BASED on the underpinnings and mechanicals of the old Renault Clio.

317
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:21,751
一辆旧车。事实上，我买的是一个拥有iPod外观的老式留声机
An old car. Basically, I've brought an iPod to a gramophone convention.

318
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,751
战五渣！瞧瞧它！
Utter rubbish! Look at it!

319
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:28,751
我们的讨论被随之而来的挑战暂时打断
Our argument was then interrupted by the arrival of a challenge.

320
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,751
他们仍旧不相信我们喜欢小型车。但事实如此！
They still don't believe that we like small cars. But we do!

321
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,751
我喜欢嘉年华。好的
I love my Fiesta. Right.

322
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:38,751
在雅尔塔和塞瓦斯托波尔之间，有条极好的滨海公路
Between Yalta and Sevastopol,there is an excellent coast road,

323
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:42,751
如果驾驶普通车辆，你们会非常享受它
which you would enjoy very much in a normal car.

324
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,751
但现在你们驾驶着三辆悲催的购物车
"But you will not be able to enjoy it

325
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:47,752
你们不会得到任何乐趣
"in your miserable little shopping carts"?!

326
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,752
喂！
Hello!

327
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,751
你不能忽视这一点，嘉年华在任何方面
You can't get away from the fact the Fiesta, in any guise,

328
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,751
都是辆出色的车
is a brilliant little car.

329
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,752
底盘是如此优秀！
The chassis is so sorted out!

330
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:16,751
我曾驾驶过ST版本，最运动的那款，那车真是棒极了
I've driven the ST version,the hot one, and it is simply superb.

331
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:21,751
令人惊讶的是在这台小引擎的驱动下
What's incredible is that they haven't lost any of that liveliness,

332
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:26,752
这车没有失去任何活泼、刺激、敏捷的特性，
that excitement, that thrill, by fitting it with a tiny, tiny engine.

333
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,252
就像在动画片里开车似的！
It's like driving a cartoon!

334
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:37,752
不错！
Squealing!

335
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,751
一点点涡轮，一点点牵引力控制
Bit of turbo boost,bit of traction control wise.

336
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,752
我正在这车的物理极限游走
That means I'm having fun and I'm on the ragged edge.

337
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:48,752
嘿嘿！
Hee-hee!

338
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:56,751
不像福特和达契亚，Up！没有涡轮
Unlike the Ford and the Dacia,the Up! doesn't have a turbocharger.

339
00:20:56,752 --> 00:21:00,752
但即使这样，它开起来依旧很刺激
But even so, it still feels like a determined spur.

340
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:06,751
我要拿第一！是的，我会的，给我闪开！
I'm going to get there first!Yes, I am, get out of my way!

341
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:09,751
唔-哈-哈！
Woo-ha-ha!

342
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,252
把它开进弯道...
And stick it into the bend...

343
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:15,751
我想说，如果我开的是辆法拉利，我会想
I mean, if I were in even a Ferrari on this road, I'd be thinking

344
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,751
噢，不，我可能会刮花保险杠！
Oh, no, I'm going to scrape my nose!

345
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:22,751
这里需要多少油门和多大力度的刹车？
但现在我不需要担心这些
"How much power do I need here and how much braking?" And I don't

346
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:27,752
因为Up！的引擎非常肉
have to worry about any of that,because the Up! has no power at all.

347
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:33,752
你只需要把油门踩到底并且保持住就行了！
You just put your foot hard down and leave it there!

348
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,751
让制片人很不开心的是
Much to the annoyance of the producers,

349
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:41,752
我们很享受一路上的驾驶乐趣
we have loved our drive on the wiggly road.

350
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:46,752
但令我们更兴奋的是路的尽头我们发现了新玩意
But we loved what we found at the other end of it even more.

351
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,752
一个废弃的前苏联潜艇基地
A disused Soviet submarine base

352
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:01,751
通常情况下，我们会把车停到停车场去
Now, ordinarily, we would have to park in the car park there.

353
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:06,752
但我们的车都很小，所以这次不用
But because our cars are so little,we won't.

354
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:15,751
真是太震撼了
This is remarkable.

355
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,751
詹姆斯·邦德都没能进来过这里！
James Bond could not have got in here!

356
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:20,752
显然，他的阿斯顿马丁太宽了
Because of course,his Aston Martin is too large.

357
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,752
老天！
Good God!

358
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,752
瞧瞧！
Look at that!

359
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,751
万一发生核战争
In the event of a nuclear war,

360
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:40,752
这里能容纳14艘潜艇，以及3000名士兵
they could get 14 submarines in here, and 3,000 people.

361
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:45,751
整个基地藏在山里！
It's under a mountain!

362
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:49,751
是的，现在这里就是我们的潜艇基地
Yeah, it is your actual under-a-mountain submarine base

363
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:51,752
我们三就是007
It's full-on Bond.

364
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,751
想当年，军情六处和中央情报局要费多少
How much energy and effort was expended by MI6

365
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:06,751
人力财力才能找到并弄清这里的每个细节？
and the CIA trying to find out the details of this place?

366
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,752
而现在我，却驾车穿梭其中！
And here I am, driving through it!

367
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:17,752
可惜，我们在潜艇基地逛了太久...
Sadly, we spent so long driving around the sub pen...

368
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:23,751
当我们赶到塞瓦斯托波尔时
that night was falling by the time we reached

369
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,752
天色已晚
the busy city of Sevastopol.

370
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:32,752
在这里，Up！孱弱的动力让我备受欺凌
And here, the Up!'s lack of oomph was a bit of an issue.

371
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,751
噢，我被加塞了！
Oh, I'm being squeezed!

372
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:42,752
我输了。我被一辆拉达2107给超掉了！
I've lost it.Being strashed by a Lada 2107!

373
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:47,751
但是，也正由于大众小巧的体积
However, because the VW is smaller than the Ford

374
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:52,752
我不需要把车停到距离酒店千里之外的停车场
and the Dacia, I didn't have to park miles and miles from the hotel.

375
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,751
停这合法吗？不，这里写了禁止停车吗？
Is that legal? No.Where does it say "no parking"?

376
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:01,751
但很多不适合停车的地方
But it doesn't say "no parking"in a lot of places where it's

377
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,751
也没标明“禁止停车”
obviously not quite right to park.

378
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,752
要这么说，这里也没写“禁止谋杀”
To be fair,it doesn't say "no murdering" either.

379
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:15,751
第二天早上，我们驾车穿越了一片
The next morning,we continued our journey through

380
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:19,752
英国人曾为之浴血奋战的土地
a region where the hills were once soaked with British blood.

381
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,751
克里米亚战争至今让人捉摸不透
The Crimean War may have been unfathomable,

382
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:29,751
没人真正了解它为什么爆发，但它给人类留下了非常多遗产
nobody really knew why it started,but the legacy is enormous.

383
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:33,751
它让我们知道了巴拉克拉法帽（也叫做滑雪头罩）和羊毛衫
It gave us important words like balaclava and cardigan.

384
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,751
留给人类伟大的弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔
It gave us Florence Nightingale

385
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:40,751
出现了世界第一位战地摄影师，第一位战地记者
the world's first war photographer,the world's first war reporter.

386
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,751
第一枚维多利亚十字勋章授予了这场战争中表现杰出的士兵
The Victoria Cross was first awarded to soldiers who fought here

387
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:46,751
直到今天，这种勋章的制造原料
And even today,the medal is made from metal

388
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,752
都取自那次战争中在这里缴获的俄军武器
taken from a Russian gun that was captured here.

389
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:57,752
之后，就诞生了那首流传已久的著名诗歌
Then, of course, there's the best-known legacy of them all.

390
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,751
那诗怎么写的？
How's it go?

391
00:25:05,752 --> 00:25:10,751
“无人答复，没有缘由
"Theirs not to make reply,Theirs not to reason why,

392
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,752
有的只是去战斗去迎接死亡
"Theirs but to do and die."

393
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:17,751
进入死亡之谷，战死骑兵600名”
（出自丁尼生诗作《轻骑兵的冲锋》）
那就是诗中描述的山谷
"Into the valley of death，rode the 600." And that is the valley.

394
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:21,751
那就是诗里轻骑兵被屠杀的地方
That is where the Charge of the Light Brigade actually happened

395
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:23,751
那是条被曲解的命令
（克里米亚战争巴拉克拉瓦战役中，
由于通讯人员错误传达命令导致数百英军骑兵阵亡）
It was a misunderstood order.

396
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:25,751
是的，他们本应该去到那里
Yeah, they were supposed to go up there somewhere.

397
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:28,751
他们本应爬上那座山丘，寻找俄军
They were supposed to snout around in the hills, looking for the Russians,

398
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:35,751
军令被曲解，他们被要求攻占那里，并且只配备了马刀，
去冲击全副武装的俄军炮兵部队
misunderstood it, came charging over here armed with sabres,
against the entire Russian artillery here

399
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:38,751
就发生在那边，径直的冲向俄军
all of it was there,pointing straight at them.

400
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:40,751
只有战马和马刀
And they were on horses with sabres.

401
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,752
怎么会发生这种悲剧？
How could that possibly end?

402
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,752
噢，上帝！
Oh, God!

403
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:02,751
时机掌握得真好！是的。太准了
Choose your moments!Exactly. Exactly.

404
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:07,751
乌克兰是全欧洲第二大国家，现在你们要
"Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe, and now you will

405
00:26:07,752 --> 00:26:09,751
驾车穿越它
"drive all the way across it,

406
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:13,751
从最南边的这里直到和白俄罗斯边境接壤的北部
"from here in the far south to the Belarus border in the north

407
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:17,751
这段旅程会比你们小时候坐车去海边渡假
"It will be worse than those long journeys you did

408
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:19,751
的那种体验更加糟糕
"as a kid in the back of a family car to the seaside.

409
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,751
这将是段地狱般的旅程
"It will be the journey from hell."

410
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,451
怎么可能比小时候更糟？那时我还是个孩子！
How can it be worse than those journeys? I was a kid then!

411
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:26,951
我那时坐的是一辆莲花Cortina Mk 1
I was in the back of a Mark I Cortina.

412
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,751
我小时候坐的是奥斯汀1100
I was in the back of an Austin 1100.

413
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:32,751
我是安格利亚。这段路多长？车底还破个洞。
Anglia。How far is it?with a hole in the floor。

414
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:36,751
这段路多长？总共750英里（1207公里）
How far is it?It's 750 miles.

415
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:41,751
750英里？用一辆大众Up！？太容易了。小菜一碟...
750 miles? What, in a Volkswagen Up!? That's easy. Piece of ca..

416
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:44,751
用这三辆小车，很轻的小车
In these three cars，light cars

417
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:47,751
我们就像现代版的轻骑兵旅
we shall be the modern-day Charge of the Light Brigade.

418
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:48,752
没错
Very good.

419
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:54,752
带着些许伤感，我们出发了
Still feeling slightly baffled,we set off.

420
00:26:56,752 --> 00:27:00,751
我觉得制片人变的有些温柔了，说实话
Well, I think the producers have gone a bit soft, to be honest.

421
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:06,751
这次挑战一点难度都没有...这种程度...
It's just not in any way difficult,challenging... It's just...

422
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:07,752
太简单了！
It's easy!

423
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:18,752
750英里！
750 miles!

424
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:24,751
后来证明这次挑战一点不简单
It turned out not to be easy at all.

425
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,751
是的，后面的内容
Yes, in the second part of that film,

426
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:30,751
等会再放，我几乎挂掉了
which we'll show you later on,I was actually killed.

427
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:31,751
是的，确实如此
Yeah, he really was.

428
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,751
这正是我们期待已久的结果
So, that's something for us all to look forward to.

429
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:35,751
好吧，谢你全家，哈蒙德
Yes, thank you, Hammond.

430
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,751
但现在，又到了嘉宾做客环节
But in the meantime, we must put a Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

431
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:43,751
今晚我的嘉宾是英国音乐人里唯一一个
Now, my guest tonight is the only British musician who can

432
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:48,751
既开过坦克，又玩过迫击炮，还能耍枪的奇才
drive a tank, fire a mortar and strip an assault rifle.

433
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,751
当然，我说的不是辣妹
（维多利亚·卡洛琳·贝克汉姆，小贝老婆）
Apart from Posh Spice, obviously.

434
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,752
女士们先生们，詹姆仕·布朗特！（英国流行歌手）
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

435
00:27:57,752 --> 00:28:00,751
你好，伙计。你好，很好
How you doing, big man。How are you? I'm well.

436
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:05,751
大家好。各位好。嗨，大家好。请坐
Hi there. How are you doing? Hi Hello. He's here. Have a seat.

437
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:08,751
好的。好多口哨声！
All right. Many whistlings!

438
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:11,751
首先，恭喜你就要结婚了
First of all, congratulations on your forthcoming marriage.

439
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:14,751
我要结婚了？（屏蔽声）
I'm getting married?（BLEEP!）

440
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:19,751
你就要和你身后的那位女孩结婚了。不错
You're getting married to the girl standing behind you. Fantastic

441
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:22,751
只是以防你忘记了。不，不是那位，看
Just in case you'd forgotten.No, there she is, look.

442
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:27,751
你叫啥名字？啊！
What's your name? Aah!

443
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:30,751
那才是正主。OK，不错。说真的，啥时候结婚？
That's the ticket. OK, great.So, when are you getting married?

444
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:31,751
9月
September.

445
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,751
我刚才在想，我知道这里很多女孩都想让我
I'm just thinking, I know there s lots of girls here and they'll

446
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:37,751
问你这方面的问题，但我想不出问什么
want me to ask lots of questions about it, but I can't think of any.

447
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,751
我们说说军队吧？好的就说军队
Shall we talk about the Army? Let's talk about the Army.

448
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,751
部队的故事不错。简单易懂
The Army's better. We've got to do the Army, it's easier.

449
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:46,751
我们都知道你曾在部队服役，流传甚广
Now, we know you were in the Army,of course, that is well documented.

450
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:49,751
但我想很多人不知道的是
But I think what a lot of people don't know is that you actually

451
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:51,751
你曾在科索沃独自一人
single-handedly,when you were in Kosovo,

452
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:53,751
阻止了第三次世界大战的爆发
stopped World War III from happening.

453
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:58,751
很高兴你能提及此事。是的，是该让英国人民知道这件事了
I'm glad you brought this up. Yeah.Because it's time the nation knew.

454
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,751
事实上，那是我这辈子最传奇的一天
Actually, it was genuinely the most incredible day of my life.

455
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:03,752
仅次于即将到来的婚礼
Other than my forthcoming marriage.

456
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,751
呃...是的...
And, er... It was...

457
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:11,751
你知道，把塞尔维亚人轰炸撤退后
You know, having bombed the crap out of the Serbs,

458
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,751
我们签署了一份和平协议并且推进到普里什蒂纳
we signed a peace accord and we pushed up to Pristina,

459
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,751
科索沃的首都，我被提拔成一名带领
the capital, and I was remarkably put as truly the first officer

460
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:20,751
30000人的军官
to lead 30,000 people up there,

461
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:24,751
当我们抵达普里什蒂纳机场时，克拉克将军
and when we got to the airport in Pristina, General Wesley Clark

462
00:29:24,752 --> 00:29:26,751
命令我们彻底消灭
told us to just overrun

463
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:30,751
200名曾经打败过我们的俄国守军
and overpower the 200 Russians who had beaten us to the airport

464
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,751
那个美国将军？
The American general?

465
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:34,751
是的，我们曾几次提出质疑，
那条命令是不是要我们彻底消灭俄国士兵？
Yeah, and we asked several times，that one thing means destroy them?

466
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:37,751
现在看来是条非常愚蠢的命令。他说彻底消灭...
Which seemed a pretty stupid thing to do. He said destroy...

467
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:41,751
他要求彻底消灭，清楚的使用了一些政治上的措辞
He said overrun and overpower,
definitely using some political manoeuvring in his wording.

468
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:44,751
经过五分钟的争论
And after, you know,five minutes of arguing,

469
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:47,751
麦克·杰克逊将军
a very special man called General Mike Jackson,

470
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,751
一个我很敬仰的人
an incredible character who I would follow anywhere,

471
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,751
从无线电里传来他的声音
came up on the radio and said,

472
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:53,751
“简直荒谬绝伦，我不会让我的士兵
"This is ridiculous,I'm not having my soldiers being

473
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,751
背上引发第三次世界大战的罪名
responsible for starting World War III,

474
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,751
让部队离开那里”
let's push off somewhere else.

475
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,751
当俄守军的食物消耗完后
And when the Russians had run out of food and water,

476
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:04,751
他们向我们寻求帮助，我们就对他们说
“没问题，只要你们开放机场就行”
they came back and asked us for food and water and we said,
"Sure, if you share the airport"

477
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:10,751
那是一位美军将军向英军上尉发布命令...
That was an order from an American to a British captain to...

478
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:15,751
那以后他就竞选美国总统去了（小布什竞选对手）。我知道
And he later then ran for president in America. I know

479
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,751
让我们聊聊音乐。军队已经聊很多了
Let's move on to music.We've covered the army.

480
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,751
你阻止了三战爆发拯救了世界，这很好
You saved the world from World War III, which is good.

481
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:22,751
你的新专辑叫登陆月球
Your new album is called Moon Landing.

482
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:25,751
登陆月球，我第一次发现它的真实含义
Moon Landing, which I only discovered after the event

483
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:28,751
是在一本都市辞典上
that "moon landing" is actually in the Urban Dictionary

484
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:31,751
他的真意是：健身房里两个男人同时弯腰时
as a term in the gym when two men are changing and they bend over

485
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:35,751
两人的屁股碰巧撞到了一起。所以，是的...
and their bottoms touch accidentally.So, yeah...

486
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,751
专辑里有支单曲叫心连心，对吗？是的
There's a single called Heart To Heart, isn't there? Yes.

487
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:41,751
请允许我帮闺女问你个问题
Now, forgive me for saying this my daughter,

488
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:45,751
几天前她对我说“我要在推特上向詹姆士
she said to me a couple of days ago,"I was going to tweet James

489
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:48,751
表达我有多喜欢那首歌”但她说“我很怕
"to say how much I love that song,"but she said, "I was so worried

490
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:52,751
他对我的回复很恶劣，所以我一直没敢这么做”
"that his tweet reply would rip me apart that I haven't dared do it."

491
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:55,351
我不会朝她恶语相向，如果她没啥恶意
I wouldn't abuse her,if she's nice.

492
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:56,751
你最近在推特上得了个什么头衔？
What have you just won on Twitter?

493
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:59,751
叫什么，推特最佳...最佳留言回复者
It's something, the best twitterer... Best Comebacks.

494
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:03,752
最佳留言回复者，那边梳着吹风头的帅哥说的不错
The Best Comebacks, from the chap over there with windswept hair

495
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:07,751
我这里摘录了几条你的留言
I've actually got a few of your ones here.

496
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:09,751
你是花了很长时间去琢磨这些回复么？
Don't they take a long time to think of?

497
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,751
我会说都是无意的，但恐怕这是在撒谎
I would say I'm spontaneous with it,but I might be lying.

498
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:16,751
有人这么给你留言“你为什么只有20万粉丝？”
Somebody said here, "Why have you only got 200,000 followers?"

499
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,752
你回答他“耶稣也只有12个门徒而已”
And you replied,"Jesus only needed 12."

500
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:26,751
得承认...这些回复很有趣
You've got to admit...they are properly very funny.

501
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,751
“ 詹姆仕·布朗特长着一张讨厌的脸和一副破锣嗓子”
"James Blunt has an annoying face and a highly irritating voice.

502
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,752
你回复道“是啊，但是没有按揭款”
You went, "Yes, and no mortgage"

503
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:37,751
介意我放一张我最喜欢的回复吗？随意
Do you mind if I show them my absolute favourite? Go for it.

504
00:31:37,752 --> 00:31:40,751
最挖苦人的一条“ 詹姆仕·布朗特究竟出了什么事？”
The rather sarky,"Whatever happened to James Blunt?"

505
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,252
这就是答复他的图片
And this was the picture you posted.

506
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:48,751
我喜欢你的地方在于，对于那些攻击你的言论
What I love about you is the way that somebody is abusive to you

507
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:52,751
你总是淡然处之，回复的十分有趣。看的我都乐趴了
and you just take it on the chin and are fine. I sob uncontrollably.

508
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:54,751
我想说，人们对待推特过于认真了
I mean, people take Twitter far too seriously.

509
00:31:54,752 --> 00:31:56,751
推特只是个网络世界而已
It's just,there's a real world out there,

510
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:58,751
大部分人觉得它很重要
and people seem to think that Twitter is important.

511
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,752
这是人们错误的观点，这种观点很二
It's just people opinions,and opinions are like arseholes

512
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:06,751
每个人都会犯二。是的，说说车
Everyone has one. Yeah. Cars.

513
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:10,751
记得你上次做客本节目时
When you were last here, I think

514
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,751
那时你唯一开过的车是拉达
the only car you'd ever driven at the time was a Lada.

515
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:17,751
没错，那时真的非常尴尬，我试着去升级它
Yeah, I was really embarrassed about that, and I've tried to upgrade.

516
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:19,751
我曾开的是一辆拉达丽娃1.3SL，SL代表“龟速”
I had a Lada Riva 1.3SL, for "slow".

517
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:22,751
如今，显然情况改变了很多
Because now, obviously,things have moved on dramatically.

518
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:23,751
你有了一辆嘟嘟车
You've got a tuk-tuk.

519
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:26,751
我从曼谷买了一辆嘟嘟车，太棒了，一种三轮车
I have a tuk-tuk from Bangkok,which is awesome, three-wheeled

520
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:30,751
能跑到70英里每小时（112公里），
我在位于伊比沙岛的家里驾驶它
vehicle, does 70mph, and I drive it around home in Ibiza.

521
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:31,751
它能跑到70英里？
It does 70?

522
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,751
70英里，如果你能带着你的朋友坐在后座
70mph, and if you get all your mates in the back,

523
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,751
你能稳稳的开到70英里
you can wheelie as well, at 70mph.

524
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,751
事实上，我有个叫Nin的好朋友，是个印度人
Actually, my best friend is a chap called Nin, he's Indian,

525
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:42,752
他一直坚持驾驶那辆嘟嘟车，
并且假装很轻松的开到70迈
and he insists on driving to make it look more authentic.

526
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:45,751
没错
Yeah.

527
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:49,751
当你住在伦敦，我猜你骑自行车。没错
When you're in London, I gather you've now got a bicycle. Yeah.

528
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:54,751
为什么骑自行车？骑车更快捷，并且锻炼身体
Why do you have a bicycle? It's much,much faster and it's good exercise.

529
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:57,751
你能减掉小肚子
You can lose a paunch with a bicycle.

530
00:32:57,752 --> 00:33:00,751
我买了辆自行车，看看我的效果。显而易见
I've got a bicycle, and look what it's done to me. Literally.

531
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,052
你不应该把它吃掉的
You're not supposed to eat it.

532
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,751
是啊...
Yeah...

533
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:12,751
最近，有关你和狗仔的新闻炒得火热
Now, you recently had an altercation with a paparazzi photographer,

534
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,751
是在美国发生的，对吧
I believe, in the United States

535
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,751
是的，狗仔很具侵略性
Yeah, paps are quite aggressive and yes,

536
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:19,751
那次我和朋友从一个聚会出来
I was coming out of a party and I was with someone who

537
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:22,751
当我出现在大街上时，他们就对着我一顿猛拍。
was in the public eye as well,and they shout. Paps don't want

538
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,751
狗仔不只希望拍到普通照片，他们想拍有料的内容
an ordinary picture,they want an aggressive picture

539
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,751
于是都围着敲打我的车窗
and they're all banging on the window,

540
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:29,751
其中一个摔倒在我车前，换作你该怎么做？
and one of them fell in front of the car, and what are you supposed to do?

541
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:33,751
他跌倒在我车前，我不想暗示自己有这种想法
He's fallen down and I wouldn't want to incriminate myself by saying

542
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:37,751
其实我没有瞄准他轻踩油门驾车慢慢压过了他
that I hadn't spotted him and touched the throttle and went gently over.

543
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:41,752
这是个错误的做法。但...但我真的这么干了
That would be the wrong thing to do.But... But we did go over him

544
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:45,751
你感到车身压过了什么肉肉的东西了吗？是的
Did you actually feel the dum-dum? Yes.

545
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:48,752
一种奇特但令人愉悦的感觉
Something strangely satisfying about it.

546
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:54,751
与此同时，警察和救护车都赶到了现场
And in the meantime, the police and the ambulance did arrive,

547
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:57,751
但在警车到来之前，他拍了很多照片
but before they arrived, he got up and took pictures of more people

548
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:00,751
甚至其他狗仔还拍了几段他碰瓷的片段
They even had some film footage from another paparazzi of him

549
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:03,751
他一边揉自己的腿一边说“弄的更红，弄得再红一些”
rubbing his leg, saying,"Make it redder, make it redder,

550
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,751
当警察赶到，他对警官说“瞧我，我被他开车压了过去”
and when the police arrived, he said,"Poor me, I've been run over.

551
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,751
但那只是一辆小出租车而已，我想没什么大不了的
But it was a very small hire car and I think it was fine.

552
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:12,752
不是那种大凯迪拉克？不是。下次你再弄一辆回家
It wasn't a large American Cadillac? No. Get one of those next time.

553
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,751
不管怎样，你的圈速，跑圈那天怎么样？
Anyway, the lap,how was it out there today?

554
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:20,751
当我今天做圈速时，他们告诉我今天是
I think as I was driving down today,they said today was the first

555
00:34:20,752 --> 00:34:24,751
气象局今年第一次发布红色天气警告
day of the year the Met Office has issued a red weather warning

556
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:27,751
如没有特殊需要不要离开家门
do not leave home unless you specifically have to,

557
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:28,751
而我却在赛道上刷圈速
and I've been doing laps.

558
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,751
如各位所知，每个来这开车的嘉宾
The thing is, as you know,everybody who comes down here

559
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:34,751
都会在倒数第二弯冲出赛道，这是正常的，没错
goes off at the second to last corner, that's a given, really,

560
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:38,751
但我听说詹姆仕从始自终一直冲出赛道
but I heard that James went off on the Follow Through.

561
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:40,751
但我也坚持到了时间用尽！
And I followed through at the time as well!

562
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:43,751
这就是为什么叫坚持到底的原因
That's why it's called the Follow Through,

563
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,751
那是个100英里全油门通过的弯道
because that's a 100mph corner,

564
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,751
你对面有个提醒你的工作人员，
and you have that building in front of you, and if things start to

565
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:52,751
当你即将失控时，他会给你警告提醒...
go wrong through there, it's actually a slightly buttock-clenching...

566
00:34:52,752 --> 00:34:54,751
是的。你们的摄像师很幸运逃过一劫。没错
Very much. And some of your camera crew are lucky to be alive. Yeah

567
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:59,751
有谁想看看我们的嘉宾在那冲出去的样子吗？
Would anybody like to see this moment when one of our guests

568
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:00,751
观众：是的
AUDIENCE: Yes.

569
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:03,751
让我们上眼瞧瞧。放片段
Let's have a look at this.Here we go.

570
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:06,751
真是倾盆大雨
That is absolutely soaking.

571
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:10,752
车速确实很快，你把油门踩得死死的直到，看！
That's properly fast, and you keep your foot in it until, look at this!

572
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,751
我很欣赏这段的原因是
What I love about that is you did not apply the brakes

573
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:17,751
直到距草地一英寸时你才踩下刹车
until you were an inch from the edge of the track.

574
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:21,751
所有人都说那里不需要松油门，所以我就尝试不松油
Everyone says you're not allowed to lift off and so I tried not to.

575
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,751
你胆子真大
We're talking big cojones there

576
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,751
确实这样，因为当时眼前一片模糊，我什么都看不见
It's actually because I couldn't see through the windscreen.

577
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,751
我都没意识到自己冲了出去
I didn't know I was coming off.

578
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,751
直到车身颠簸眼前一片绿 - “好像冲出赛道了”
It started to get bumpy and green - "This has definitely gone wrong."

579
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:37,751
不管怎样，最终，我们还是跑完了一圈。
是的，谁想看看？
Anyway, eventually, we did get a lap together. Yeah. Who'd like to see it?

580
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:39,752
是的！播放正片
Yeah! Here we go.

581
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:44,751
瞧，我认为这是一次信心十足的起步
See, I think this is the Blitz spirit.

582
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:47,752
加油！（和谐音）
Come on, then! BLEEP!

583
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,751
赛道就像（和谐音）湖一样
It's like a BLEEP lake out here

584
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:54,751
是的，没人抱怨环境署
Yeah, nobody's complaining about the Environment Agency,

585
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,752
你进弯了，“你们为什么不把那清理干净？”
you're going in there, "Why don t you come and clear it up?"

586
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:00,752
真的很湿滑啊！
That is so wet!

587
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:04,751
路线保持得很好
Stayed on the track nicely.

588
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:05,752
就像在滑冰
It's like ice skating.

589
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:08,751
不像我平时那种滑冰
Not that I ice skate very often

590
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,752
你真的需要理查德·哈蒙德的那种座椅增高垫
You really should have borrowed Richard Hammond's booster cushion.

591
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:17,752
我需要摩西把这里的积水清干净。
（摩西：旧约圣经中分开红海海水的先知）
那有架飞机
I needed Moses to part the sea.There's a private jet over there

592
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:21,751
它能载我回家！伊比沙岛，没错
That could get me home! Ibiza, right.

593
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:23,751
榔头弯，可能看不见白线
Hammerhead, probably couldn't even see the lines,

594
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,752
技术不错
so that's pretty impressive.

595
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:32,751
好的，来到高速弯。太慢了
Here we go, right, coming up to the Follow Through again. So slow.

596
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:37,752
转速提到6000转，又来了，我(和谐音)什么都看不见
Up to 6,000. And again,I can't see a BLEEP thing.

597
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:43,751
我很欣赏你的表现
This is, I really admire you for doing this.

598
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:48,751
带一点点刹车，没有贬低的意思。穿过轮胎墙
A touch of the brakes, and I can't say I blame you. Through the tyres.

599
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:53,751
没有抱怨。顺利通过倒数第二弯
No whingeing, no complaining.And, yeah, going to make that one.

600
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:57,751
不错，真的。这时刮来一阵狂风
Not bad at all, actually.And it's blowing a gale.

601
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:02,752
哇奥！这是吉米·卡尔的走法！就这样。冲线！
Whoa! It's the Jimmy Carr line!There we are. Across the line！

602
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,751
这真是，真的...从没看过这种表现
That is really, properly...I've never seen it like that.

603
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:11,751
是的，很刺激，因为最后一圈
Yeah, it was fascinating,because last time

604
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:15,751
同样很湿滑，基本上，不论你把我放到哪里
I came down it was wet as well, and basically, whenever you have me on,

605
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:19,752
毫无疑问的，这都是最湿滑的一圈，
詹姆仕·布朗特最湿滑的一圈
unsurprisingly, it is the wettest,James Blunt is the wettest lap.

606
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:26,751
前两周我们板子上已经有了两圈湿滑记录
We have had two previous wet laps in the last couple of weeks.

607
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:32,751
休·博内威利1分50秒1，
汤姆·希德斯顿上周做出了1分49秒9
Hugh Bonneville at 1.50.1,Tom Hiddleston last week at 1.49.9,

608
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,751
记住这点，他的圈速也很湿滑，但不像你这次...
so bearing in mind, he was very wet,but nothing like...

609
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:39,751
一点没我这圈湿滑。猜一下，你会在哪？
Not nearly as wet as me. So come on,where do you think you come?

610
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:42,751
我希望不要跑得太差
I really hope I haven't humiliated myself too much.

611
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:44,751
不，你跑的不差
No, you haven't humiliated yourself,

612
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:47,751
因为你开上了赛道，这已经很勇敢了，并且你成功完成了一圈
because you went out there, which is brave enough, and you drove around

613
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:50,751
表现很惊人，看起来你也信心十足
in it, which is very marvellous and you looked determined.

614
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:53,751
就像校运会，每个参与的人都是胜利者
Like one of those schools where everyone's a winner.

615
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:58,751
所以，目前最快湿圈，1分49.9秒。你的成绩...
So there we are, fastest lap so far,1.49.9. You did...

616
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,751
1分...
1...

617
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:03,751
49秒...
49...

618
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:06,752
4
4.

619
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:14,751
我要说...这是目前最快湿圈.你排在罗恩·霍华德前面
I have to say... That is the fastest wet lap. You are above Ron Howard.

620
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:17,752
就在乔丝·斯通的下面。
我一直在某些人的下面...好吧就这样
And just under Joss Stone.I'm always under some... Anyway

621
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:23,752
感觉背后有双眼睛正注视着我。是的。我能看见
Feel the eyes in the back of my head.Yes. I can see them.

622
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:29,751
你排在乔丝·斯通和罗恩·霍华德之间。真是个奇怪的排名
You're between Joss Stone and Ron Howard. That's a very odd place to be.

623
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:32,751
但真的很棒。确实如此。谢谢
That was quite something.It really was. Thank you.

624
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:34,751
女士们先生们，詹姆仕·布朗特！
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

625
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,752
谢谢
Thank you.

626
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:47,751
好的，今晚我们要证明我们确实喜欢小型车
Now, tonight we are trying to prove that we really do like small cars,

627
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:50,751
而制片人要证明它们是一堆垃圾
and our producers are trying to prove that they're rubbish.

628
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:55,751
是的，所以我们三被要求开着三辆1升排量的小掀背
Yes, so, they told us to drive our three one-litre hatchbacks

629
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:56,951
穿越乌克兰
all the way across Ukraine,

630
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:00,952
他们称这是一次地狱般的旅行
a trip they said would be the journey from hell.

631
00:39:09,752 --> 00:39:13,751
他们为什么觉得这是一次地狱般的旅行？
Why do they think this is going to be the journey from hell?

632
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,751
开车横穿乌克兰
Driving across the Ukraine.

633
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:18,751
过去24小时里，我们经历了冷战，
We've only been here 24 hours,we've been through the Cold War

634
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:22,751
二战，克里米亚战争。让人印象深刻
the Second World War, the Crimean War. It's going to be tremendous.

635
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:23,752
就开着这辆Up！
And I'm in my Up!

636
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:29,751
在不久之前，我们驾驶的这些小型车
In the not too distant past,little cars like ours

637
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:34,751
还很简陋，但时至今日，如果你选则正确
were very spartan, but these days,if you choose your car wisely

638
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,752
你能得到一大堆有趣且实用的配置
you get loads of stuff to play with.

639
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:41,751
好的，哈蒙德，你的空调感觉如何？
Right, Hammond, have you got your air conditioning set just so?

640
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:43,751
是的，我刚刚把空调调低了半度
I have, yes, I've set it just half a degree lower

641
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:45,751
防止自己太舒适而睡着
than would be too comfortable.

642
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:48,751
这是座椅加热，我想设到一档就好
This heated seat, I think,just to the first position.

643
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:49,751
USB
USB.

644
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:53,751
USB iPod启动
USB iPod.'

645
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:56,751
蓝牙连接我的iPod到立体声音响
Bluetoothed my iPod into the stereo system.

646
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:59,751
车窗除雾，试试看
Heated windscreen, let me try that.

647
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:01,752
定速巡航。好像没用
Cruise control. Haven't done that.

648
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:11,752
很好，副驾有面镜子
Yep, a mirror on that side.

649
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:19,751
终于，我和哈蒙德把车上的所有功能都玩了个遍
Eventually, though, even Hammond and I ran out of things to play with,

650
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:23,752
于是我们把注意力都放到了欣赏乌克兰美景中去
so we turned our attention to the Ukrainian scenery.

651
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:48,752
放眼望去，空空如也
A hill or two wouldn't go amiss

652
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:28,752
好吧，我承认，这简直太无聊了
Right, I admit it, this is boring.

653
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:33,752
你们觉得行驶了有一半路程吗？
Do you think we're halfway there yet?

654
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:37,751
我们要弄清楚这个问题
We needed to find out.

655
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:40,751
于是，在看不懂卫星导航界面的情况下
So, as we couldn't understand the writing on our sat-nav systems,

656
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:44,751
我们靠边停车取出了地图
we pulled over to consult a map

657
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,751
我们从这里出发，对吧？
We came from down here, yes?

658
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,751
终点在这里
And we've got to go all the way there.

659
00:41:49,752 --> 00:41:51,751
我们刚经过一个叫Pravda的小镇
We've just gone through a town called Pravda.

660
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:54,751
我们不可能离它有多远
We can't be further back than that.

661
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:57,752
可能在...不会是这。我们在这
Maybe it's in...Can't be there. We've done that

662
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:07,751
噢，老天，噢不！在这。别扯了！真的！我们才开到这！
Oh, Christ, oh no! It's there. Don't be daft! It is! We're only here!

663
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:11,752
我们才走了这么点距离。
只相当一个怀特岛的长度（英国南部海岛）。
We've only done that. We've only driven over the Isle of Wight.

664
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:16,752
我们要去这里。怎么能...我们才到这里？！
We've got to come here。How come ..We've only got there?!

665
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:22,751
这是个好消息。是么？
这怎么算是个好消息？确实是好消息
And that's good news. Is it? How is that good news? It's good news.

666
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,751
是么？是的
Really? Yes.

667
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,751
除了傻坐在车里大叫“真无聊”
Instead of just sitting and,"I'm bored,"

668
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,751
我们为什么不自己找点有意义的事情做呢？
why don't we make ourselves more rounded human beings on the journey?

669
00:42:30,752 --> 00:42:33,751
你意思是我们在车里试着做点其他事？
So while we're in the car we learn to do some thing?

670
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:38,751
没错！我们可以在车里大叫“真无聊，真讨厌这次旅程”
Exactly! We could sit there going,
"I'm bored,I'm bored, I wish I wasn't doing this,"

671
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:43,751
也可以对自己说
“我要把这段时间利用起来干些有意义的事”
or we can simply say, "No, we shall use this time constructively.

672
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:48,751
我们能在抵达白俄罗斯之前
We will arrive in Belarus more intelligent

673
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:50,252
让自己过得更充实
and more rounded than we are now.

674
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:55,751
回到路上，我们的自我进修之旅开始了
Back on the road,the self-improvement began.

675
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:59,751
哈罗，欢迎来到乌克兰语自学课堂。第一讲
Hello and welcome to Teach Yourself Ukrainian. Unit one.

676
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:01,751
哈罗，你叫啥名？
Hello, what's your name?'

677
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,751
通过聆听这张CD你能快速学会
"You will learn to play blues harp quickly

678
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,751
如何吹奏蓝调口琴。
"and easily by just listening to the CD." 

679
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:08,752
噢，这本书后面还有张CD！
Ooh, I've got a CD!And following the book."

680
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:12,751
各位亲，你们可能注意到了我正戴着一顶魔术帽
Viewers, you will notice I'm wearing my magic hat

681
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:14,752
并且有张纸牌贴在上面
and that there is a playing card in it.

682
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,751
Karus再次邀请Stephen到家中
Karus again invites Stephen to his home to discuss

683
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,752
讨论一些业务问题
some business questions.'

684
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:28,752
把它插进去
So that goes in there.

685
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:34,752
这...
Well...

686
00:43:37,752 --> 00:43:40,752
在移动语言教室里，情况进展的不错
In the mobile language lab,things were going well.

687
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,752
内衣
Underwear.

688
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:49,751
很快我就有了在路边找家店
And soon I felt confident enough to get us

689
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,752
买点东西吃的信心
something to eat at a roadside cafe.

690
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:10,751
你在说啥？我说想买点非鱼类食物
What are you saying? I'm trying to find some food that isn't fish.

691
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:11,752
噢，谢谢
Oh, thank you.

692
00:44:21,752 --> 00:44:23,752
好像你下了一比木材订单
You seem to have ordered some wood.

693
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:27,252
接着，杰瑞米想买些苹果
Jeremy then asked for some apples.

694
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,752
好吧，东西吃过了。能上路了吗？
Well, we've eaten. Shall we go?

695
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:43,751
第二天，在扔掉了多余的早餐之后...
The next morning, after breakfast had been cleared away..

696
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:46,751
何方暗器？！
What?!

697
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:49,752
我用新掌握的乌克兰语查看导航仪
I used my new Ukrainian skills to check the sat-nav.

698
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:57,752
噢，老天。离基辅还有13小时49分钟路程
Oh, Jesus. To get to Kiev,13 hours and 49 minutes.

699
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:07,751
正当我们绝望之际，在大雾弥漫中，穿过路边菜地
We were in a state of despair, but then, out of the fog loomed a man.

700
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:09,752
我们发现了这个
And behind him, this.

701
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,752
一片废弃的核弹发射基地
An abandoned nuclear missile base.

702
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:22,751
这是发射井，是吧？是的。很大啊
This is the silo, is it? That's a silo. It's ever so big

703
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:28,751
哈蒙德，这是一枚SS18洲际弹道导弹，北约代号“撒旦”，
打击目标是赫德福德郡的Ross-on-Wye镇
Hammond, this is an SS18, nicknamed the Satan, targeted Ross-on-Wye.

704
00:45:28,752 --> 00:45:32,751
是吗？这上面写明了。等等。
Was it? That's what that says.Hang on a minute, though.

705
00:45:32,752 --> 00:45:35,752
这上面写了“第二打击目标是Chipsky Norton”
It says "alternative target Chipsky Norton" there.

706
00:45:37,752 --> 00:45:40,752
我猜它可能受潮了
I think it must be damp

707
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:50,751
很多人对长途驾驶有厌倦情绪，但这次旅途
Many people complain about having to do a long drive, but on this one,

708
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:55,752
被我们找到了让时间飞快流逝的办法
we really had hit on a brilliant way of making the time fly by.

709
00:46:02,752 --> 00:46:06,751
哈哈！各位看官，我的手是空的
Ha ha! Viewers, my hands empty,

710
00:46:06,752 --> 00:46:11,752
空无一物。现在，瞪大你的眼...
nothing at all in them.Now, can I...

711
00:46:21,752 --> 00:46:26,751
第三单元。史蒂文，你有家人吗？又是史蒂文
'Unit three. Stephen, do you have a family?' There's Stephen again.

712
00:46:26,752 --> 00:46:29,751
里面每个人都叫史蒂文，这是我学到的
Everybody's called Stephen here,that's the one thing I have learned.

713
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:33,752
噢，老天，我的鸽子逃出来了
Oh, God. My doves have escaped.

714
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:38,751
我的鸽子跑出来了。什么鸽子？
My doves have got out. What doves?

715
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:42,751
你啥意思？我的鸽子从魔术箱里跑出来了
What do you mean, got out? My doves from my magic box.

716
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:45,751
后备箱都是，到处便便
They're all over the back.They've crapped everywhere.

717
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:50,752
被鸽子骚扰一阵后，快崩溃的梅决定放走它们
Upset by the mess,OCD May ejected the culprit.

718
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,751
噢，老天，那卡车...那鸽子被处决了
Oh, my God, there's a lorry...That is an ex-dove.

719
00:46:56,752 --> 00:47:01,751
是的，现在，你瞧那辆卡车撞上了你的鸽子，詹姆斯
Yeah, now, you see,the truck that hit your dove, James,

720
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,751
你的魔术学得怎么样了？说真的，它没飞走吗？
how good are you at magic? Seriously, did it not fly away?

721
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:08,751
你不会去参加小孩子的派对，对吧
You're not going to do children's parties, are you,

722
00:47:08,752 --> 00:47:11,751
因为你可能要改变一下你的表演方式
because you're going to have to change your act if you are.

723
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:13,751
好吧，萨莉，这就是你家鹦鹉吗?
"So, Sally, is this the family parrot?

724
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:16,951
仔细看，当我把它扔出窗外的卡车时
"Just watch what happens

725
00:47:16,952 --> 00:47:18,752
会发生什么奇迹
"when I throw it out of the window of a moving vehicle.

726
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:25,751
抛开这次意外的小悲剧
Putting this tragic incident behind us

727
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:32,752
我们继续前行，在夜色降临之前抵达了乌克兰首都，基辅
we ploughed on, and by nightfall had reached Ukraine's capital, Kiev.

728
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:37,752
杰瑞米带我们走进一家旅店
Jeremy checked us into the hotel

729
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:41,751
是的
Yeah.

730
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:45,751
你说yes是不是只想让他闭嘴？
Did you just say yes to stop him talking?

731
00:47:45,752 --> 00:47:48,751
在酒吧里，詹姆斯表演了另一个失败魔术
And in the bar, James did another trick that went wrong.

732
00:47:48,752 --> 00:47:50,751
哒-哒！
Ta-da!

733
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:54,751
我选的不是这张。你不能昧着良心说你之前挑的不是这张
I'm afraid not. You can't change your mind about the card you chose.

734
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:57,751
这就是你选的牌。你不能强行说这就是我选的牌
That was the card you chose.You can't tell me what card I chose.

735
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,751
但我知道你选的就是这张牌，因为我会读心术
But I know you chose that because I read your mind.

736
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:03,751
魔术师应该使用技巧征服观众，而不是靠耍流氓
Magicians are supposed to exercise a degree of finesse, not just bullying.

737
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:05,752
不，还是错的。就是它！这就是你选的
No, it's still not.It is! That's what you chose

738
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,751
第二天早上
The following morning,

739
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:14,752
我们被警告有一大群狂热粉丝在街上等着我们出现，事实确实如此
we were warned there was a mob on the streets of Kiev, and there was.

740
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:22,752
谢谢各位捧场，非常谢谢
Thank you for coming,thank you so much.

741
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,751
所以，为了获得短暂的宁静
So, to get a bit of peace and quiet,

742
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:30,752
我们被邀请体验当地唯一的一条赛道...
we were told to report to the country's only racetrack...

743
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:37,751
这也是本次的终极挑战
for what, chillingly,was called the final challenge.

744
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:42,751
你们每辆车都会加满23升的燃油
"Your cars will each be given exactly 23 litres of fuel,

745
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:44,751
考虑到它们都很省油
"which, because they're so economical,

746
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:48,751
所以这些油应该足够你们行驶100英里或更长
"should easily be enough for them to cover the 100 or so miles

747
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:52,751
以抵达本次挑战的目的地，一个白俄罗斯边境小镇
"to your destination, a town near the border with Belarus."

748
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:56,751
等等，23升？开100英里？
这根本就算不上是挑战，不是么？
Hang on, 23 litres? To do 100 miles? That's not really a challenge, is it?

749
00:48:56,752 --> 00:49:01,751
简直太容易了！
你们的任务是在终点前耗光所有燃油。呃？
That's easy! "Your challenge is to run out before you get there." Eh?

750
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,751
你们绝对想达成这个目标
"This is something you will want to do,

751
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:06,752
因为终点小镇的名字叫...
"as the town in question is called...

752
00:49:08,752 --> 00:49:09,752
切尔诺贝利
Chernobyl."

753
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,752
我们真的能...我们可以去那？能吗？
Can we actually...We can't go there, can we?

754
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:25,751
切尔诺贝利事件是人类历史上最严重的一次核事故
Chernobyl was the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident.

755
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:28,751
当1986年四号反应堆发生爆炸时，
When reactor number four exploded in 1986,

756
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:33,751
它向周围环境释放出大量放射性尘埃，
结果导致周围大片地区
it released a radioactive cloud so devastating that the entire area

757
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:38,752
在未来2万年内不再适宜人类居住
will remain uninhabitable for 20,000 years.

758
00:49:39,752 --> 00:49:44,751
除非我们让各自车的耗油量保持在20英里每加仑以下
（超过百公里11.76升），
And unless we could make our cars do less than 20 miles to the gallon,

759
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:47,752
否则切尔诺贝利就是我们本次旅程的终点
this is where we'd end up.

760
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:52,751
福特称我的车每加仑能跑65英里（百公里3.6升）
Ford claim mine does 65mpg.

761
00:49:52,752 --> 00:49:55,751
我这一路的油耗都在60英里每加仑（百公里3.9升）左右
All the way here, this has done 60 miles to the gallon, give or take.

762
00:49:55,752 --> 00:50:00,751
是的。怎么可能让这些车做到20英里每加仑的耗油量？
Yes. How would you make these cars do 20 miles to the gallon?

763
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:02,752
我都不能想象它能降到30英里每加仑（百公里7.8升）
I can't imagine getting it under 30.

764
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:07,751
当制片人给每辆车精确加满23升燃油后
After the producers had put precisely 23 litres of fuel in each tank,

765
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:11,752
我们也在给各自车做着准备
we did some preparations of our own.

766
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:13,752
很好
Right.

767
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,751
我真是太TM机智了
Clever, this.

768
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:22,751
给每条轮胎放出30%气体
What I'm going to do is let about 30% of the pressure out of the tyres.

769
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:25,751
原理是这会增大滚动阻力
The point is,it increases rolling resistance

770
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:27,752
结果油耗能大大增加
which means I use more fuel.

771
00:50:35,752 --> 00:50:37,751
增重完成
That is one heavy Up!

772
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,751
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

773
00:50:39,752 --> 00:50:41,751
我把每条缝隙都用胶带密封防止放射性尘埃进入车内
I'm sealing all the gaps so that radioactive dust can't get in.

774
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:45,752
你这么干的结果就是，你让车身风阻更小了
What you've done there, Hammond is made it more aerodynamic.

775
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:49,752
是吗？是的。一路好走
I have, haven't I? You have. Goodbye.

776
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:54,751
为了让车在100英里内烧掉更多油
To get through this much petrol in less than 100 miles,

777
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:57,751
我们要像个神经病一样去开车才行
we would have to drive like maniacs.

778
00:50:57,752 --> 00:51:00,752
3、2、1
Three, two, one.

779
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,152
上吧！拉高转速！
Come on! Build up the revs!

780
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:19,752
切二档。转速拉到红线区。老天，真浪费
Second gear. Right to the limiter.God, that's wasteful.

781
00:51:21,752 --> 00:51:26,751
詹姆斯和我不约而同的想到了低档高转速耗油策略
James and I decided to go for a low-gear policy of maximum revs.

782
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:28,752
而另一边，哈蒙德...
Hammond, on the other hand...

783
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:35,751
如果我一路都这么开车，行驶里程就会变长
If I keep doing this all the way there, I'll go further.

784
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:41,752
这会让路程加倍。这就是解决之道。不停转向。喔哦！
It will be twice the distance. This is the answer. Lock to lock. Ooh!

785
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,751
这里要小心点
That's where I'm going to have to be careful,

786
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:47,752
这里交规靠右行
when there's traffic coming the other way.

787
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:51,752
才想起来！
I've just realised!

788
00:51:52,752 --> 00:51:54,751
我居然没把灯组打开
I'm driving without the lights on.

789
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,751
还开着节能模式...
I'm driving with the eco-engine system...

790
00:51:56,752 --> 00:51:59,751
后窗除雾开启，全部打开。座椅加热，是的
Heated rear window, I want that on.Heated seats, yes.

791
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:01,752
这就好多了
That's better.

792
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:07,751
看我这么开车别人会觉得我是个神经病
Probably people think this is a bit odd,

793
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:10,752
但如果他们知道我正在做什么的话，他们会理解的
but if they knew why I was doing it,they would understand.

794
00:52:15,752 --> 00:52:17,751
简直不敢相信他们会让我们做这种事
I can't believe they're making us do this,

795
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:22,751
因为这个地区的辐射并没衰减。危害依旧存在
because it's not like the radioactivity has gone. It hasn t.

796
00:52:22,752 --> 00:52:28,751
辐射物有半衰期，
那里残存的辐射污染物半衰期有24万5千年
It has a half-life, material that's left, of 245,000 years.

797
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:32,751
显然詹姆斯·梅，能解释什么是半衰期
And James May, obviously,can explain what a half-life is

798
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:35,752
实际上现在他很可能正滔滔不绝
In fact, he probably is doing.

799
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:38,751
半衰期几乎是恒定的。
A half-life is actually constant.

800
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:43,751
比如一块铀具有半衰期，当经过一个半衰期之后
A piece of uranium will have a half-life and when that half-life is passed,

801
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:46,751
剩余物质的半衰期依旧不变
the remaining bit still has the same half-life.

802
00:52:46,752 --> 00:52:50,751
我认为这个词是由玛丽·居里首创的
I think the word was coined by Marie Curie.

803
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:52,751
在20世纪初
The early 20th century was the time

804
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,752
当放射现象首次被发现和定义时...
when radioactivity was identified and discovered...

805
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:02,751
经过25英里（40公里）的高转速路程后
After 25 miles of red-line motoring,

806
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:04,752
Up！的油耗依旧不容乐观
the news from the Up!still wasn't good.

807
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,752
我的平均油耗已经降到23英里每加仑（百公里10升）
I've managed to average 23 miles to the gallon.

808
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:14,752
必须更低。怎么能更低？
I've got to get that down.How do I get that down?

809
00:53:19,752 --> 00:53:24,751
很好，现在空气阻力更大了
Right, the drag is now dramatically worsened.

810
00:53:24,752 --> 00:53:25,752
与此同时...
Meanwhile...

811
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:32,752
说实在的，我有点想吐了
I am feeling a bit sick now,if I'm honest.

812
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:38,752
噢，那是警车？噢，老天
Oh, is that a police car? Oh, dear.

813
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:46,751
目前情况很糟
There's the horrible evidence.

814
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:50,751
已经跑了四分之一的路程，25.5英里（41公里）
At a quarter distance, 25.5 miles,

815
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:54,751
我应该消耗掉其中一格油量才对
I should have lost one of those four bars that I started with.

816
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:56,751
但油表连根毛都没变
But it's not happening.

817
00:53:56,752 --> 00:53:59,752
快点啊，汽油！赶快烧完
Come on, petrol! Sod off.

818
00:54:04,752 --> 00:54:07,751
OK，我们被警察拦住了
OK, we've been pulled by the police.

819
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:10,751
他们对我蛇形驾驶表示疑惑
They were wondering why I was zigzagging.

820
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,751
警察正和摄制组交谈
They're talking to the camera car in front.

821
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:17,751
与此同时，我让引擎疯狂空转
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here at max RPM to try and use some fuel

822
00:54:17,752 --> 00:54:18,752
以便消耗更多燃油
while I'm stationary.

823
00:54:22,752 --> 00:54:25,751
当哈蒙德还在骚扰警察时
Whilst Hammond was deafening the police,

824
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:28,752
我靠边停车拔掉了引擎管理系统控制线
I pulled over to disable my engine management system.

825
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:32,751
怎么样！
How about that!

826
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:35,751
发动机报警灯亮起。是的。就是我想要的
Engine warning light.Yes. That's what we want.

827
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:39,751
现在引擎启动了故障应急模式
What the engine has to do now is assume a sort of worst-case scenario,

828
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:41,751
因为它收不到传感器的各种数据
because it doesn't know anything about itself,

829
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:46,751
于是它认为现在温度很低，燃油品质很差
so it will assume it's very cold,the fuel quality is bad,

830
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:48,752
这样油耗就增大了
so it must be less efficient.

831
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:57,751
距切尔诺贝利还有30英里（48公里），
哥三的车依旧坚挺
30 miles from Chernobyl,all our cars were still running

832
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:02,752
我们尝试了已知的各种办法让车更耗油
and we were trying every trick in the book to make them conk out

833
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:06,752
看我现在的空气阻力！
Look at that for drag now!

834
00:55:09,752 --> 00:55:12,751
刹车。加速
Brake. Then accelerate.

835
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:15,752
再刹车。在加速
Then brake. Accelerate.

836
00:55:18,752 --> 00:55:20,752
还有三格油！老天！
Still got three bars! Come on!

837
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:30,752
看！17.8英里每加仑（百公里13.2升）。
我的油量报警灯亮了！噢，耶
There it is! 17.8mpg.My fuel light has come on! Oh, yeah.

838
00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:36,752
21英里每加仑（百公里11.2升）。我做的还不够好！
I'm doing 21 miles to the gallon.I'm not doing well enough!

839
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:43,751
都空了。指针停在耗尽的位置
Everything's on empty.The needle, on empty.

840
00:55:43,752 --> 00:55:45,752
快点，停下来。停住
Come on, run out. Run out.

841
00:55:47,752 --> 00:55:51,752
车外气温只有一摄氏度。都快冻僵了
It's one degree out there.Nipples are sticking out badly.

842
00:55:53,752 --> 00:55:56,752
啊！我看见理查德·哈蒙德了
Ah! I believe this is Richard Hammond.

843
00:55:57,752 --> 00:55:59,752
这车应该停下来了
This thing should not be moving

844
00:56:01,752 --> 00:56:08,751
我做到了！我做到了！我做到了！
别告诉我你已经把油烧完了。没错！
I'm going! I'm going! I am going!Don't tell me you've run out. Yes!

845
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:14,752
是的！哈！哈！噢，太爽了！停下来了
Yes! Ha ha! Oh, bliss! It's gone

846
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:19,752
简直不敢相信。它...
I don't believe you. It...

847
00:56:22,752 --> 00:56:26,751
你难以置信。下一讲
I don't believe you. Sit rep.

848
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:29,751
理查德·哈蒙德是个（和谐音）
Richard Hammond is a BLEEP.

849
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:31,252
你继续。向地狱前进
Go on. Go and meet your fate.

850
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:42,752
没有涡轮的Up！继续前行。直到...
The un-turbo-charged Up! continued onwards. And then...

851
00:56:43,752 --> 00:56:47,752
噢，等等。那是啥？好象是个检查站
Oh, wait a minute. What do we have here? Some kind of checkpoint

852
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:53,751
辐射区周围30英里（48公里）被隔离起来
The barrier marked the start of the 30km exclusion zone,

853
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:57,751
现在我不得不进入辐射区了。詹姆斯也一样
and now I'd have to go through it.So would James.

854
00:56:57,752 --> 00:57:01,751
但进去之后谁来摄像？
But who would film what happened afterwards?

855
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,751
摄制组的三个摄像师。是的
Three main cameramen. Yeah.

856
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:08,752
他们打道回基辅了。什么？
They're getting in a taxi and going back to Kiev. What?

857
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:10,558
他们不打算进去。就这么闪人了
They're not going in。There they go

858
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,472
所以我们即将进入全世界最危险的地方，和两个...
So we film the most dangerou thing we ever done with two...

859
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,920
我无意冒犯，但只是两个摄影助理而已
I don’t want be rude。But camera assists

860
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,511
我要感谢你们。是的
I actually want thank you.yes.

861
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:20,870
感谢你们，你们非常勇敢
Thank you very much，you are very brave

862
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,748
现在你们晋升为官方摄像师了
You are now promote the official cameramen.

863
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:27,999
我知道你们现在很想马上逃走，但...这次挑战意义重大
I know you want to get out on the road,
but this is... this is a bit much 

864
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:31,920
这是我们为进入隔离区所做的准备工作
Those was us all going in made that preparations

865
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:38,000
好的，切换内循环，出风口关闭
Right，air on recycle,vents shut

866
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:42,999
盖革计数器。开启
Geiger counter.on

867
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:55,127
这是台货真价实的盖革计数器。一直在嗒嗒作响
That really is a Geiger counter.and its really going tick-tick

868
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:03,999
摄影师像往常一样在揽胜后面进行拍摄，
但是车门是关上的
The cameramen has to film at back with landrover as usual，
but with the door closed

869
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,972
通常后门是开启的
normal the tailgate is proper open

870
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:16,558
目前仍有17吨左右高放射性废料
There's something like 17 tonnes of radioactive waste

871
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,472
暴露在核心反应区
still in the exposed reactor core.

872
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:24,120
苏联人在核心外围建造了一座巨大的石棺
They're building an enormous sort of arch, really, over

873
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:28,911
罩住整个反应堆，防止污染扩散，但没彻底完工
the entire site, which will seal it off, but that is not finished yet.

874
00:58:31,071 --> 00:58:35,070
距离8公里，我开始祈求上帝
With 8km to go,I had started to beg.

875
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:38,848
耗光、赶快耗光
Run out. Run out now.

876
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,219
但啥事也没发生
But it didn't.

877
00:58:47,431 --> 00:58:50,120
辐射仪指针一直在升高
That needle is definitely moving.

878
00:58:50,121 --> 00:58:53,400
迹象很明显，我们已经不可避免地
Now it had become imperative we didn't run out

879
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:55,620
要经过核心辐射区了
until we were well past the reactor.

880
00:58:58,762 --> 00:59:00,127
就是它
There it is.

881
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:13,162
那就是四号主反应堆的真身
That is the remains of reactor number four.

882
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,157
难以置信
This is unbelievable.

883
00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:25,281
我知道现在不是为这事得意的时候
I wouldn't want to appear to be gloating at a time like this,

884
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:28,161
但我车还有两格油量
but I do still have two bars of fuel left.

885
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:31,910
但我没有
I didn't.

886
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:37,400
噢，天啊！别现在停下
Oh, my God! Don't stop now.

887
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:40,143
像往常一样，我遇到了大麻烦
And as a result,I was in serious trouble.

888
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:49,843
这里就是当年核电厂职工的生活区
This is where the people who worked at the nuclear facility all lived.

889
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:53,976
被彻底遗弃。已经过去28年了
Totally abandoned now.It has been for 28 years.

890
00:59:56,191 --> 00:59:59,058
看呐。瞧那边
Look at it. Look at that there.

891
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:05,521
这应该是世上最令人震撼的场景了
This has to be one of the world's most astonishing spectacles.

892
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:08,223
噢，我的天...我见过这场景！
Oh, my... I've seen this!

893
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,613
就是这。这就是传说中的游乐场
This is it. This is the playground.

894
01:00:19,997 --> 01:00:24,412
哇噢，惊人的辐射量。确实要离开这了
Whoa, big spike. It is definitely now time to get out of here.

895
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:34,528
挺住，Up！别在这里停下
Come on, little Up!Don't run out now.

896
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,666
噢，这...它没油了
Oh, that was... It coughed.

897
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:43,503
没油了。没油了。它不动了
That was a cough.It's gone. It's gone.

898
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:59,846
大家为啥鼓掌？有啥好鼓掌的？
Why are they applauding that? Why are you applauding?

899
01:00:59,847 --> 01:01:02,156
最后你咋离开那的？
So how did you get out?

900
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:06,086
我就在那等着，猜测你会回头来救我，但你却...
I waited, thinking you would come and rescue me, which you...

901
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:08,378
好吧，我没有，因为...你没回来
Well, I didn't, because...No, you didn't.

902
01:01:08,379 --> 01:01:12,338
因为那时我想，
我们需要留一人在那座荒芜的城市里自生自灭
We do leave a man in the field, or in this case, the contaminated city.

903
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:17,366
没错，所以我只好走着出来。
真的？现在有啥感觉吗？是的
Yes, so I had to walk. Really? So, any effects? Yes.

904
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,337
我和两个没义气的混球录了整整一小时的节目
I've had to present this entire show with two penises.

905
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:24,084
并且这种脑残事我坚持干了11年
But then, I have been doing that for 11 years.

906
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:25,440
说得好
Funny.

907
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:29,222
不论如何，说回到车，最关键的部分
Anyway, right, the cars,the important bit.

908
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:32,678
是的，嘉年华太棒了。是的，我知道。它救了我的命
Yes, and the Fiesta is brilliant.Yes, I know it is. It saved my life.

909
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:34,502
是的，它做到了
Yes, it did.

910
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:39,463
没错，但要明白，达契亚，
哈蒙德，比你的车便宜1万英镑（101476人民币）
Yes, but we must remember, the Dacia, Hammond, is £10,000 cheaper.

911
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,758
是啊，因为它是台垃圾
Yes, because it's rubbish.

912
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,444
不，如果你要买一辆小车，你最关注的是价格
No, but if you buy a small car,you want it to be cheap.

913
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:49,348
不，品质才是最重要的。实际上，两样都重要
No, you want it to be good.Actually, you want it to be both.

914
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:51,468
是啊，但Up！两样都缺
Yes, but the Up! is neither.

915
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:55,576
听着，梅，你曾亲口说过Up！非常优秀
Listen, May, you said the Up!was brilliant and intelligent.

916
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:57,198
我啥时候说过这话？
When did I say that?

917
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,783
18个月前你在一本杂志上写过一篇这样的测评文章
You wrote it in a road test in a magazine about 18 months ago.

918
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:04,917
真希望你没看见过那篇测评
I was rather hoping you wouldn't have read that.

919
01:02:04,918 --> 01:02:06,357
是的，但我看过了
Yes, but I did read it.

920
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:08,499
所以，这次节目再次证明
So once again, it turns out that on this show,

921
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,958
我的观点是最客观和理性的。是吗？
I am the voice of reason and common sense. Really?

922
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:15,477
没错，Up！是最值得购买的小车
Yes, and the Up!Is the small car to buy.

923
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:18,397
但不是这辆，这辆被辐射过了
Not that one, though, because that's been irradiated.

924
01:02:18,398 --> 01:02:20,966
是啊，但是，哈蒙德，你还敢坐在它上面
Yes, actually, Hammond,you are sitting on it,

925
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:23,608
也就说你现在患上了辐射PP病
which means you now have a radioactive anus.

926
01:02:23,608 --> 01:02:25,617
啊！
Ah!

927
01:02:25,618 --> 01:02:29,616
伴着这条爆炸性新闻，是时候说再见了。感谢各位的观看
And on that bum-shell, it's time to end. Thank you so much for watching.

928
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:31,360
我们下周见。晚安
See you next week. Good night.

929
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:52,035
