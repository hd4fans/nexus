Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

Now, remember.

00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,266
[sighs]

164
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:59,110
Here. Go on. Take it.

165
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,083
[giggling]

166
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,118
[groans]

167
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,132
Ah, don't. Huh?

168
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,606
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

169
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:28,805
Another suitor for the princess.

170
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,576
- [giggling]
- [woman screams]

171
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,379
- [whinnying]
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.

172
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:35,919
Hey!

173
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,683
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

174
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,725
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

175
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,385
[men laugh]

176
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,328
[grimacing]

177
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,228
Look at that, Abu.

178
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,564
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

179
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:53,126
[crowd] Ooh!

180
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,196
You are a worthless street rat.

181
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,573
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

182
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:02,772
and only your fleas will mourn you.

183
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,851
I'm not worthless.

184
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,149
And I don't have fleas.

185
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,884
[sighs] Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

186
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,062
¦Ä Riffraff, street rat

187
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:28,469
¦Ä I don't buy that

188
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:32,305
¦Ä If only they'd look closer

189
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:36,575
¦Ä Would they see a poor boy

190
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,376
¦Ä No, siree

191
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,886
¦Ä They'd find out

192
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:47,721
¦Ä There's so much more

193
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,955
¦Ä To me ¦Ä

194
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,288
[sighs]

195
00:11:56,401 --> 00:12:00,201
Some day, Abu,
things are gonna change.

196
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:02,229
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

197
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:06,572
and never have any problems at all.

198
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,544
[roosters crowing]

199
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:12,009
I've never been so insulted.

200
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,917
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

201
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,080
Good luck marrying her off.

202
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,750
Oh! Jasmine.

203
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:24,118
[Sultan] Jasmine!

204
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,095
Jasmine!

205
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,189
- Jasmine!
- [snarling]

206
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,393
Confound it, Rajah.

207
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,866
So, this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out.

208
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,431
Oh, Father.

209
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,342
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

210
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,642
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

211
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:46,478
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

212
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:47,984
[both laughing]

213
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,351
[clears throat]

214
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:54,915
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

215
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:58,860
The law says
you must be married to a prince...

216
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:00,897
by your next birthday.

217
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:02,422
The law is wrong.

218
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,764
You've only got three more days.

219
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:08,499
Father, I hate being forced into this.

220
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,872
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.

221
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,104
Jasmine...

222
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:17,375
it's not only this law.

223
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:24,046
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I...

224
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,784
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

225
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,258
Provided for.

226
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,057
Please try to understand.

227
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,361
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

228
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:37,526
[grumbles]

229
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,194
Except you, Rajah.

230
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,771
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

231
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,309
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

232
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,312
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

233
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,247
Oooh! I... I...

234
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,410
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

235
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,953
Hmm?

236
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:11,063
I don't know where she gets it from.

237
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:15,128
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

238
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,731
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

239
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:21,369
My most trusted advisor.

240
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,278
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

241
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:27,112
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

242
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:28,879
It's this suitor business.

243
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,444
Jasmine refuses
to choose a husband.

244
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:34,514
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

245
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:36,457
[laughing] Oh!

246
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:41,096
- Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
- [Jafar laughs]

247
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:44,464
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

248
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,695
[grumbles]

249
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,264
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

250
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:52,468
to this thorny problem.

251
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,135
If anyone can help, it's you.

252
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:59,342
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

253
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,318
Oh. Uh, my ring?

254
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:04,752
But it's been in the family for years.

255
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:08,087
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

256
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,956
Don't worry.

257
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:13,690
Everything will be fine.

258
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:16,324
Everything will be... fine.

259
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,493
The diamond.

260
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,094
Here, Jafar.

261
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,608
Whatever you need will be fine.

262
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,405
You are most gracious, my liege.

263
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:31,141
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

264
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:34,742
Yes. That will be pretty good.

265
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:37,944
[spits, coughs]

266
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,115
I can't take it anymore!

267
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:46,187
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

268
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,490
Bam! Whack!

269
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,931
Calm yourself, lago.

270
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,333
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!

271
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:56,237
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

272
00:15:56,307 --> 00:16:00,676
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

273
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:02,269
Ha, ha!

274
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,157
[whining]

275
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,290
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

276
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:25,529
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

277
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,664
I'll miss you.

278
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,037
[whimpers]

279
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:39,878
Goodbye.

280
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:50,620
[vendors calling out]

281
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,356
Okay, Abu. Go.

282
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:58,363
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

283
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:00,529
[squeaking]

284
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,765
- Get your paws off that.
- [taunting]

285
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,898
Why, you...

286
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:07,740
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

287
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,941
Goodbye.

288
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,314
- Nice going, Abu.
- [cooing]

289
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:16,615
Breakfast is served.

290
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,416
Pretty lady, buy a pot.

291
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,825
No finer pot in brass or silver.

292
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:27,363
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.

293
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,626
Sugar dates and pistachios.

294
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,497
Would the lady like a necklace?

295
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:34,129
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

296
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:35,570
Fresh fish!

297
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,129
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

298
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,869
Oh, no. I don't think so.

299
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,342
- Oh!
- [gulping]

300
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,346
- Excuse me.
- [gulps]

301
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:45,279
[belches]

302
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,519
I'm really very sorry.

303
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,388
Wow.

304
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,627
Uh-oh.

305
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,756
Hello? Hello?

306
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:07,270
Oh, you must be hungry.

307
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:08,999
Here you go.

308
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:12,236
You'd better be able to pay for that.

309
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,435
Pay?

310
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,604
No one steals from my cart.

311
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,443
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

312
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:19,949
- Thief!
- Please...

313
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:24,044
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

314
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,316
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

315
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,119
No! No, please!

316
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,184
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

317
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:33,253
I've been looking all over for you.

318
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,423
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

319
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,865
You, uh, know this girl?

320
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,529
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

321
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:42,196
She's a little crazy.

322
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:45,071
She said she knew the Sultan.

323
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,975
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

324
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,643
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

325
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,709
[gibberish]

326
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,085
Tragic, isn't it?

327
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:01,181
But no harm done.

328
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:04,091
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

329
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,652
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?

330
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,359
- No, no, no. Not that one.
- Come on, Sultan.

331
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,732
[gibbering, gasping]

332
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:14,798
Huh? What?

333
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:18,336
Come back here, you little thieves!

334
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,438
[explosion]

335
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,246
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

336
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:28,911
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

337
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,977
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

338
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:34,754
Yes, O mighty Evil One.

339
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:35,883
[panting]

340
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:40,320
Part, sands of time.

341
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:44,561
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

342
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:47,968
Yes! Yes!

343
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,438
There he is.

344
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,873
My diamond in the rough.

345
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:56,538
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

346
00:19:56,614 --> 00:20:02,883
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

347
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,545
Swell.

348
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,317
[coughs]

349
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,518
[sinister laughter]

350
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,584
Almost there.

351
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,372
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

352
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,100
Uh, forget it.

353
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:29,540
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

354
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:32,475
Is it that obvious?

355
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,609
Well, you do kind of stand out.

356
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:42,118
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

357
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,786
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

358
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,352
Wow.

359
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,658
[chuckling] Hey.

360
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,792
Come on. This way.

361
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,930
Whoa. Watch your head there.

362
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,564
Be careful.

363
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,438
Is this where you live?

364
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,707
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

365
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,748
That sounds fabulous.

366
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:09,081
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

367
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,015
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

368
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,888
Oh, it's wonderful.

369
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,087
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

370
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:20,653
and have servants and valets.

371
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:24,394
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

372
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,936
It's better than here.

373
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:29,802
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

374
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,103
You're not free to make
your own choices.

375
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,770
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

376
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,109
[both]...trapped.

377
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,449
[clears throat]
So, where are you from?

378
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,179
What does it matter?

379
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:48,850
I ran away
and I am not going back.

380
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:51,520
Really? How come?

381
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,256
Why, you...

382
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,596
My father's forcing me
to get married.

383
00:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,466
That's... that's awful.

384
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:05,030
- [Aladdin] Abu!
- [angry squeaking]

385
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,304
What?

386
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:11,041
Abu says, uh...
that's not fair.

387
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:12,207
What?

388
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,682
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

389
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:18,552
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

390
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:22,149
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

391
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,285
Oh, boy.

392
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:25,988
Hmm.

393
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:29,590
Tell him that's very sweet.

394
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:33,292
Here you are.

395
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,806
- [both] They're after me! After You?
- My father must have sent them...

396
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:38,136
- Do you trust me?
- What?

397
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,234
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

398
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,903
Then jump!

399
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:52,819
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

400
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:55,715
Run! Go! Get out of here!

401
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:58,261
Get this thing off of me!

402
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:01,195
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get me off

403
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:02,596
Let him go.

404
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:07,160
- Looky here, men. A street mouse.
- [guards laugh]

405
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:10,832
Unhand him,
by order of the princess.

406
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,973
Princess Jasmine.

407
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,807
- The princess?
- [Abu] Princess?

408
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,939
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

409
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:22,816
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

410
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:27,118
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

411
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:31,127
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

412
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,267
Jafar?

413
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,133
Oh, Princess.

414
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:43,639
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

415
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,937
How may I be of service to you?

416
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,342
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

417
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:53,679
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

418
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,275
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

419
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,684
I can't breathe, Jafar.

420
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:01,349
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

421
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,757
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

422
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:06,523
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

423
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:09,532
Oh, dear.

424
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,900
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

425
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:15,199
What do you mean?

426
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:18,867
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

427
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:20,409
What sentence?

428
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:22,468
- Death.
- [gasping]

429
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,538
- By beheading.
- No.

430
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:31,653
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

431
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,418
How could you?

432
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,288
[weeping]

433
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,158
[coughing]

434
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,189
[coughing, gasping]

435
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,361
So, how did it go?

436
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:50,133
I think she took it... rather well.

437
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,569
[Jasmine crying]

438
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,681
It's all my fault, Rajah.

439
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:11,453
- I didn't even know his name.
- [Rajah murmuring]

440
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:32,314
She was the princess.

441
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:34,748
I can't believe it.

442
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:37,150
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.

443
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,621
[Abu] Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

444
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,021
Hello!

445
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:43,821
Abu. Down here.

446
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,055
[squeaking]

447
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,154
Come on, help me out of these.

448
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:50,359
[scolding]

449
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:58,903
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

450
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:03,004
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.

452
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,516
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

453
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,676
She's gotta marry a prince.

454
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:13,122
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

455
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,249
I'm a, I'm a fool.

456
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:19,261
[man] You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

457
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,591
Who are you?

458
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:24,100
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

459
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,102
But together,
perhaps we can be more.

460
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,468
I'm listening.

461
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:33,498
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

462
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:37,741
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

463
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,543
Ooh!

464
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:43,609
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.

465
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,247
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

466
00:26:46,323 --> 00:26:48,951
- [squawking]
- But the law says only a prince can...

467
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,859
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

468
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:54,362
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

469
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:55,830
[wheezing laugh]

470
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:59,197
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

471
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:03,832
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.

472
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:05,568
Uh, one problem.

473
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:07,701
It's out there.
We're in here.

474
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:12,545
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

475
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:15,414
So...

476
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,544
do we have a deal?

477
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,987
Oh, I don't know.

478
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,922
[thunder crashing]

479
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:34,802
Who disturbs my slumber?

480
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,804
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.

481
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,879
Proceed.

482
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:47,974
Touch nothing but the lamp.

483
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:51,282
Remember, boy,
first fetch me the lamp,

484
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:55,314
and then you shall
have your reward.

485
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:57,155
Come on, Abu.

486
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:09,997
[squeaking]

487
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,836
- Would you look at that!
- [whimpering]

488
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,082
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the Sultan.

489
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,982
Abu!

490
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:24,145
[whines]

491
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:26,951
Don't... touch... anything.

492
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:28,718
We gotta find that lamp.

493

[grumbles]

494
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,877
Huh?

495
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,781
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

496
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,380
[screeches]

497
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,984
Abu, what are you, crazy?

498
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:34,314
A magic carpet.

499
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:37,827
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

500

[screeches]

501
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:50,629
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

502
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,969
Thanks.

503

[squeaking]

504
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,180
Wait a minute. Don't go.

505
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:04,186
Maybe you can help us.

506
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:09,018
Hey! Whoa!

507
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,686
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.

508
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:16,098
- I think he knows where it is.

Oh!

513

This is it?

514
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:12,386
This is what we came
all the way down here to...

515
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,389
Abu! No!

516
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:17,952
- [cave] lnfidels!
- Uh-oh.

517
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:23,091
[cave] You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

518
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:30,605
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

519
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,430
Whoa!

520
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:56,065
Help! Help! Help!

521
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:02,762
Gotcha!

522
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,443
Carpet, let's move.

523
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:25,158
Abu!

524
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:28,322
Abu, this is no time to panic.

525
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:30,392
Start panicking.

526
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,492
[both] Whoa!

527
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,843

- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

531
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,425
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

532
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:08,334
First give me the lamp.

533

[maniacal laughter]

534
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,407
Yes!

535
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,913
At last!

What are you doing?

538
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:26,021
Giving you your reward.

539
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,956
Your eternal reward.

540
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,890

It's mine.

545
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:01,022
It's all mine.

546
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:03,889
I... where is it?

547
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,154
No.

548
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:07,321
No!

549
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:14,263
Jasmine?

550
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,597
[Sultan] Oh, dearest.

551
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,336
What's wrong?

552
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,900
[sniffling]

553
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:24,970
Jafar has...

554
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,414
done something terrible.

555
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:30,317
There, there, my dear.

556
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:32,752
We'll set it right.

557
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:36,349
Now, tell me everything.

558

Oh.

559
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,590
Aladdin. Wake up.

560
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,292
Aladdin.

561
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:47,165
Oh! My head.

562
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,597
We're trapped.

563
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,700
That two-faced son of a jackal!

564
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:56,245
[snarling]

565
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:59,577
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

566
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:01,880
Aha!

567
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:05,785
[chuckling] Why, you hairy little thief.

568
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,484
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

569
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,027
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

570
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:15,394
but it's hard to make out.

571
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:29,669
Aaaaahhhhh!

572
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:31,907
Oy!

573
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:36,680
1 0,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

574
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:38,186
Hang on a second.

575
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:41,246
Whoa! Whoa!

576
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:43,315
Does it feel good
to be outta there.

577
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,486
Nice to be back,
ladies and gentlemen.

578
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,757
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

579
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:49,298
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

580
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,300
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

581
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:54,427
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just "Din."

582
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:58,235
How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."

583
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:01,970
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

584
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,003
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
[giggling]

585
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,675
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

586
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,480
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

587
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:14,182
Give me some tass-el.
Yeah. Yo, yo.

588
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,749
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

589
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:21,354
That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side. Do I look different to you?

590
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:24,491
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?

591
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,559
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

592
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:29,935
The ever impressive,

593
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:32,839
the long contained,

594
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,274
often imitated,

595
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,312
but never duplicated...

596
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:38,438
[echoing] Duplicated, duplicated...

597
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:40,106
Genie...

598
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:42,549
of the Lamp!

599
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,416
Right here direct from the lamp,

600
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:46,887
right here for your
very much wish fulfillment.

601
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,321
[Genie] Thank you.

602
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,086
Whoa. Wish fulfillment?

603
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,592
Three wishes to be exact.

604
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,391
And ix-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.

605
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,399
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.

606
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,764
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

607
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:00,996
Now I know I'm dreaming.

608
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,137
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

609
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:05,164
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

610
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,505
So why don't you just ruminate

611
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:10,569
whilst I illuminate
the possibilities.

00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,472
¦Ä So what's your wish
I really wanna know

651
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,280
¦Ä You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt

652
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:59,582
¦Ä All you gotta do is rub like so

653
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:03,490
¦Ä Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three

654
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,050
¦Ä I'm on the job, you big nabob

655
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:09,189
¦Ä You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

656
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,529
¦Ä You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

657
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:12,863
¦Ä You ain't never

658
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,163
¦Ä Had a

659
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:15,568
¦Ä Friend

660
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:16,662
¦Ä Like

661
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,707
¦Ä Me

662
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,901
Ah ha ha!

663
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:23,568
- Wah ha ha!
- [greedy laugh]

664
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,479
¦Ä You ain't never had a friend like me ¦Ä

665
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:28,418
- [buzzing]
- [weak applause]

666
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:28,474
- [buzzing]
- [weak applause]

667
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:31,418
[chattering] Huh?

668
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,614
- [groans]
- So, what'll it be, Master?

669
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:38,058
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

670
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,560
Ah, almost.

671
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:42,598
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

672
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:43,654
Like?

673
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:47,191
Ah, rule number one:.
I can't kill anybody.

674
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,567
So don't ask.

675
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,003
Rule number two.

676
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:54,100
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

677
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:56,168
You little punim there.

678
00:39:56,245 --> 00:40:00,579
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

679
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,881
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

680
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:06,285
Other than that, you got it.

681
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:08,152
- Hmm.
- Oh!

682
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:13,356
Provisos?
You mean limitations?

683
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:16,330
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.

684
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:19,163
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

685
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:22,932
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

686
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,200
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out.

687
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:27,242
Excuse me?

688
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,302
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

689
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:33,177
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

690
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,274
And all of a sudden
you're walking out on me?

691
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,548
I don't think so,
not right now.

692
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:40,714
You're gettin' your wishes,
so sit down!

693
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,384
- [Abu screeches]
- In case of emergency,

694
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,825
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

695
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:48,523
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

696
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:50,566
We're...

697
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:53,193
outta here!

698
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:54,203
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.

699
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,764
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.

700
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,866
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

701
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,006
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

702
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,641
before they are beheaded.

703
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,652
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

704
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,017
Jasmine...

705
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:17,185
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

706
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,352
Please.

707
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:22,523
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

708
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:25,863
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

709
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:30,065
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

710
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,800
[chuckles nervously]

711
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:34,468
That's nice.
All settled, then.

712
00:41:34,544 --> 00:41:37,741
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

713
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:40,004
Jasmine!

714
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,209
[growls]

715
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:45,846
If only I had gotten that lamp.

716
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:49,187
"l will have the power
to get rid of you."

717
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:52,250
[growling] To think
we gotta keep kissing up

718
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:56,287
to that chump
and his chump daughter

719
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:59,061
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, lago.

720
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:02,730
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

721
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:04,670
Then she'll have us banished.

722
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,368
Or beheaded.

723
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:09,377
[both] Eww!

724
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,379
Oh. Wait a minute.

725
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:15,440
Jafar. What ifyou were
the chump husband?

726
00:42:15,518 --> 00:42:16,644
What?

727
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,280
Okay, you marry
the princess, all right?

728
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:24,122
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

729
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,558
Oh.

730
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,153
Marry the shrew.

731
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:30,665
I become the sultan.

732
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,759
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

733
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:40,765
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

734
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:42,367
Yaaah!

735
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:44,504
Kersplat!

736
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,104
[wicked laughter]

737
00:42:46,182 --> 00:42:49,345
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

738
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:52,216
[both laugh sinisterly]

739
00:42:58,094 --> 00:43:02,224
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

740
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:06,098
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

741
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,193
Thank you.
Goodbye now. Good-ye.

742
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,363
Thank you.Good-ye.

743
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:13,534
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

744
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:13,676
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

745
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:18,477
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

746
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:20,708
Dost mine ears deceive me?

747
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:23,217
Three? You are down by one, boy.

748
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:27,052
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

749
00:43:27,123 --> 00:43:28,886
You did that on your own.

750
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,827
Well, I feel sheepish.

751
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:37,161
All right, you baaad boy,
but no more freebies.

752
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:40,532
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.

753
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:42,594
I want them to be good.

754
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:44,401
What would you wish for?

755
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:46,464
Me?

756
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,737
No one's ever asked me that before.

757
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:51,746
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.

758
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:53,805
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

759
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,181
Come on. Tell me.

760
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:57,377
Freedom.

761
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,354
You're a prisoner?

762
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:01,890
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

763
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:05,688
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

764
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:07,126
Itty bitty living space.

765
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:09,391
Genie, that's terrible.

766
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:11,990
But, oh, to be free.

767
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,400
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

768
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,132
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

769
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,106
To be my own master.

770
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:21,939
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

771
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,707
and all the treasures
in all the world.

772
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,715
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.

773
00:44:27,783 --> 00:44:29,182
It's not gonna happen.

774
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:31,446
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

775
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,885
Why not?

776
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:36,789
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

777
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,259
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

778
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,057
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

779
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,464
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

780
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:47,365
After I make my first two wishes,

781
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:50,701
I'll use my third wish
to set you free.

782
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,900
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.

783
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:55,307
Let's make some magic.

784
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:58,108
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

785
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,014
Well, there's this girl.

786
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,415
Wrong.

787
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:06,046
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

788
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:07,589
Oh, but, Genie,

789
00:45:07,656 --> 00:45:10,591
she's smart and fun and...

790
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,627
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

791
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:16,256
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair. Wow.

792
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:18,664
And her smile... [sighs]

793
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:19,996
Ami.

794
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:22,230
C'est l'amour.

795
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,363
But she's the princess.

796
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,431
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

797
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:29,444
Hey, can you make me a prince?

798
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,036
Let's see here.

799
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:33,877
Chicken a la king? Nope.

800
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:37,180
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

801
00:45:37,253 --> 00:45:39,881
Caesar salad. Ah!
Et tu, Brute? No.

802
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:43,186
Aha. "To make a prince."

803
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:45,489
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

804
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:48,428
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

805
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:50,158
All right!

806
00:45:50,232 --> 00:45:51,563
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

807
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:55,001
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

808
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,470
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

809
00:45:57,573 --> 00:46:00,041
No. Let's work with me here.

810
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:03,203
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

811
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:06,180
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

812
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:09,046
It says mode of transportation.

813
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:11,985
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.

814
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,954
- Uh-oh.
- [Genie] Here he comes.

815
00:46:14,023 --> 00:46:17,151
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

816
00:46:17,226 --> 00:46:21,094
than riding your very own
brand-new camel.

817
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:24,496
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.

818
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,762
Still not enough.

819
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:28,633
Let's see.
What do you need?

820
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:31,332
Yes!

821
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:34,774
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

822
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:36,869
- Whoa!
- [trumpets]

823
00:46:36,946 --> 00:46:40,074
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

824
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,747
[trumpets]

825
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:44,911
[frightened monkey noises]

826
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,349
Abu, you look good.

827
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:50,915
[Genie] He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

828
00:46:50,993 --> 00:46:52,984
But we're not through yet.

829
00:46:53,062 --> 00:46:57,692
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

830
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:06,500
[door opens]

831
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:10,238
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

832
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:12,872
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

833
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,176
Oh, really?

834
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,411
Right here.

835
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:19,420
"lf the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

836
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:23,891
then the sultan shall
choose for her."'

837
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:26,792
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.

838
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:29,092
How could I choose
someone she hates?

839
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:32,133
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

840
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:36,194
"lf in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found,"

841
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:37,261
Jerk.

842
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:41,332
"a princess must then be wed to..."'

843
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,810
Hmm. Interesting.

844
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:45,642
What? Who?

845
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:47,375
The royal vizier.

846
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:50,941
Why, that would be... me.

847
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,818
But I thought the law says

848
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:56,255
that only a prince
can marry a princess.

849
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:57,825
I'm quite sure that...

850
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,796
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

851
00:48:01,864 --> 00:48:05,061
Yes. Desperate measures.

852
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:09,264
You will order
the princess to marry me.

853
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:11,602
I will order...

854
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:13,369
the princess...

855
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:14,602
to...

856
00:48:14,677 --> 00:48:17,111
But you're so old.

857
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:20,615
The princess will marry me.

858
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:22,318
The princess will marry...

859
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:25,185
- [trumpet fanfare]
- What? What is that?

860
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:26,653
That music.

861
00:48:28,857 --> 00:48:30,188
[chuckling]

862
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:32,887
Jafar, you must come
and see this.

863
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:41,463
¦Ä Make way for Prince Ali

864
00:48:41,537 --> 00:48:43,869
¦Ä Say hey

865
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:47,272
¦Ä It's Prince Ali

866
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:49,368
¦Ä Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

867
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:52,209
¦Ä Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star

868
00:48:52,281 --> 00:48:57,651
¦Ä Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye

869
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,086
¦Ä Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums

870
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:01,782
¦Ä You're gonna love this guy

871
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:07,386
¦Ä Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

872
00:49:07,463 --> 00:49:12,025
¦Ä Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

873
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:14,501
¦Ä Now, try your best to stay calm

874
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,198
¦Ä Brush up your Sunday salaam

875
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:21,003
¦Ä Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

876
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:26,036
¦Ä Prince Ali, mighty is he,
Ali Ababwa

877
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:30,142
¦Ä Strong as ten regular men definitely

878
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:33,052
¦Ä He faced the galloping hordes

879
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:35,386
¦Ä A hundred bad guys with swords

880
00:49:35,457 --> 00:49:39,416
¦Ä Who sent those goons to their lords
Why, Prince Ali

881
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:43,261
¦Ä He's got 75 golden camels

882
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:44,822
Don't they look lovely, June?

883
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,528
¦Ä Purple peacocks, he's got 53

884
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:49,468
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.

885
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:53,235
¦Ä When it comes to exotic-type mammals

886
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:56,709
¦Ä Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you

887
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,269
¦Ä It's a world-class menagerie

888
00:49:58,347 --> 00:50:02,181
¦Ä Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa

889
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:07,188
¦Ä That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee

890
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:10,054
¦Ä Well, get on out in that square

891
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,218
¦Ä Adjust your veil and prepare

892
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:16,424
¦Ä To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali

893
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:20,366
- ¦Ä He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- ¦Ä He's got the monkeys

894
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:25,703
- ¦Ä Let's see the monkeys
- ¦Ä And to view them he charges no fee

895
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:29,141
¦Ä He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies

896
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,044
¦Ä Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him

897
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:36,312
¦Ä They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

898
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:38,353
¦Ä Prince Ali

899
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:45,622
¦Ä Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa

900
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:50,324
¦Ä Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

901
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:52,731
¦Ä And that, good people, is why

902
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:54,496
¦Ä He got dolled up and dropped by

903
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,367
¦Ä With 60 elephants, llamas galore

904
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,463
¦Ä With bears and lions,
A brass band and more

905
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:00,441
¦Ä With his 40 fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers

906
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:01,908
¦Ä His birds that warble on key

907
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:04,104
¦Ä Make way

908
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:09,446
¦Ä For Prince Ali ¦Ä

909
00:51:11,587 --> 00:51:15,045
[clapping] Splendid.
Absolutely marvelous.

910
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:16,747
[clears throat]

911
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:18,452
Your Majesty,

912
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:21,462
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

913
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,555
Prince Ali Ababwa.

914
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:27,295
Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.

915
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:30,566
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

916
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,869
Ecstatic.

917
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:35,774
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
- Ababwa.

918
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,175
Whatever.

919
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:40,215
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

920
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:43,581
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

921
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:45,176
Ooh.

922
00:51:45,254 --> 00:51:48,883
I don't suppose I might...

923
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:52,654
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

924
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:55,822
Sire, I must advise against this.

925
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:59,162
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

926
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:00,793
Ow, ow, ow.

927
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,167
Ahh! Whoa!

928
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:12,036
Just where did you say
you were from?

929
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:17,142
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

930
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:19,153
- Try me.
- [Sultan] Look out, Polly.

931
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:23,391
Hey, watch it.

932
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,619
Watch it with the dumb rug.

933
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:27,628
Aah!

934
00:52:27,696 --> 00:52:29,789
Whew!

935
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:37,701
Out of the way.
I'm coming in to land.

936
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:39,240
Jafar, watch this.

937
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:41,674
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

938
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:46,771
Yes, I do seem
to have a knack for it.

939
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:49,215
This is a very impressive youth.

940
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:51,650
And a prince besides.

941
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,281
[whispers] If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

942
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:58,087
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

943
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,321
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,

944
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:02,420
I'm an excellent judge of character.

945
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:05,557
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!

946
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:08,797
[Sultan] Jasmine will like this one.

947
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,396
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

948
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:15,307
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

949
00:53:15,377 --> 00:53:17,538
This boy is no different
from the others.

950
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:20,582
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

951
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:23,516
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

952
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:26,918
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

953
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:28,422
How dare you.

954
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,392
All of you. Standing around
deciding my future?

955
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:35,294
I am not a prize to be won.

956
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:37,855
Oh, dear.

957
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,333
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

958
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:43,064
Just give Jasmine time
to cool down.

959
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:48,405
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abooboo.

960
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:54,140
[Aladdin sighs] What am I gonna do?

961
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:56,411
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

962
00:53:56,518 --> 00:54:00,181
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

963
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:02,281
[growling]

964
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,122
So move.

965
00:54:06,695 --> 00:54:08,185
Hey.

966
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:10,562
That's a good move.

967
00:54:10,632 --> 00:54:13,260
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

968
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:15,599
Genie, I need help.

969
00:54:15,671 --> 00:54:17,696
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.

970
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:19,798
If you wanna court
the little lady,

971
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,809
you gotta be
a straight shooter.

972
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:23,811
- Do you got it?
- What?

973
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:26,006
Tell her the...

974
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:27,912
-...truth!
- No way.

975
00:54:27,983 --> 00:54:31,817
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

976
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:33,912
she'd laugh at me.

977
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:36,480
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

978
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:41,719
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

979
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:43,822
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

980
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:45,867
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

981
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:50,564
I just... I gotta be smooth,
cool, confident.

982
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:53,800
How do I look?

983
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:57,170
Like a prince.

984
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:07,855
[sighs]

985
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:12,049
- [Aladdin] Princess Jasmine?
- [growling]

986
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:16,153
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

987
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:19,598
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

988
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:21,397
I do not want to see you.

989
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,995
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

990
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,563
- [Jasmine] Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

991
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:29,132
So, how's our little beau doing?

992
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:33,006
- Good kitty, take off.
- [Rajah growling]

993
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:34,514
Down, kitty.

994
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:35,675
Wait. Wait.

995
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:38,151
Do I know you?

996
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,688
Uh, no. No.

997
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:45,056
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

998
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:47,618
The marketplace?

999
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:50,597
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

1000
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:54,863
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants.

1001
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:57,131
It couldn't have been me you met.

1002
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:00,834
No. I guess not.

1003
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:03,538
[Genie] Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

1004
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:06,342
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

1005
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:08,007
Anything. Pick a feature.

1006
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,984
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

1007
00:56:11,053 --> 00:56:14,420
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
-...punctual.

1008
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:15,615
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

1009
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,988
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

1010
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,118
Hmm.

1011
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:21,424
I'm rich, too, you know.

1012
00:56:21,496 --> 00:56:24,431
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

1013
00:56:24,499 --> 00:56:26,490
I know.

1014
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:30,231
A fine prize
for any prince to marry.

1015
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:33,274
Uh, right. Right.
A prince like me.

1016
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:34,501
Warning! Warning!

1017
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:37,704
Right. A prince like you.

1018
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:41,306
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

1019
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:44,011
Mayday! Mayday!

1020
00:56:44,086 --> 00:56:46,748
[Jasmine] Just go jump off
a balcony!

1021
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,983
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

1022
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,389
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

1023
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,123
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

1024
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:56,994
- Yeah, right.
- What?

1025
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:59,294
Uh... Uh, you're right.

1026
00:57:00,669 --> 00:57:04,605
[sighs] You aren't just
some prize to be won.

1027
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:07,506
[Aladdin] You should be free
to make your own choice.

1028
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:08,873
I'll go now.

1029
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:10,809
- No!
- What? What?

1030
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:12,141
How...

1031
00:57:12,214 --> 00:57:14,774
How are you doing that?

1032
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,410
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

1033
00:57:17,486 --> 00:57:18,520
- [kisses]
- You, uh...

1034
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,420
- [kisses]
- You, uh...

1035
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:23,856
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

1036
00:57:23,925 --> 00:57:26,189
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

1037
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:29,424
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

1038
00:57:30,298 --> 00:57:33,324
- What?
- Do you trust me?

1039
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:36,905
Yes.

1040
00:57:36,905 --> 00:57:37,303
Yes.

1041
00:57:51,786 --> 00:57:55,745
¦Ä I can show you the world

1042
00:57:55,824 --> 00:58:00,193
¦Ä Shining, shimmering, splendid

1043
00:58:00,262 --> 00:58:01,854
¦Ä Tell me, Princess

1044
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:07,891
¦Ä Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

1045
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,928
¦Ä I can open your eyes

1046
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:15,374
¦Ä Take you wonder by wonder

1047
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:18,241
¦Ä Over, sideways and under

1048
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:22,181
¦Ä On a magic carpet ride

1049
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,118
¦Ä A whole new world

1050
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:29,885
¦Ä A new fantastic point of view

1051
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:34,622
¦Ä No one to tell us no
Or where to go

1052
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:37,426
¦Ä Or say we're only dreaming

1053
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:41,333
¦Ä A whole new world

1054
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:45,499
¦Ä A dazzling place
I never knew

1055
00:58:45,574 --> 00:58:50,011
¦Ä But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

1056
00:58:50,078 --> 00:58:54,481
¦Ä That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

1057
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:57,882
[Aladdin] ¦Ä Now I'm in
A whole new world with you

1058
00:58:57,986 --> 00:59:01,922
[Jasmine] ¦Ä Unbelievable sights

1059
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:05,552
¦Ä Indescribable feeling

1060
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,653
¦Ä Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

1061
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,824
¦Ä Through an endless diamond sky

1062
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,496
- ¦Ä A whole new world
- ¦Ä Don't you dare close your eyes

1063
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:19,938
- ¦Ä A hundred thousand things to see
- ¦Ä Hold your breath, it gets better

1064
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:24,570
¦Ä I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far

1065
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:27,979
¦Ä I can't go back to where I used to be

1066
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:30,916
- ¦Ä A whole new world
- ¦Ä Every turn a surprise

1067
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:34,752
- ¦Ä With new horizons to pursue
- ¦Ä Every moment, red-letter

1068
00:59:34,823 --> 00:59:39,385
¦Ä I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

1069
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:46,196
[both] ¦Ä Let me share
This whole new world with you

1070
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:50,261
- ¦Ä A whole new world
- ¦Ä A whole new world

1071
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:54,297
- ¦Ä That's where we'll be
- ¦Ä That's where we'll be

1072
00:59:54,376 --> 00:59:58,176
- ¦Ä A thrilling chase
- ¦Ä A wondrous place

1073
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:01,181
¦Ä For you and me ¦Ä

1074
01:00:16,097 --> 01:00:16,564
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

1075
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:20,227
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

1076
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:24,333
It's a shame
Abu had to miss this.

1077
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:26,567
Nah. He hates fireworks.

1078
01:00:26,641 --> 01:00:28,666
[Aladdin]
He doesn't like flying, either.

1079
01:00:28,743 --> 01:00:32,611
Uh, that is, um...
Oh, no.

1080
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:34,876
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

1081
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:37,440
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

1082
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,453
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

1083
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:41,489
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

1084
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:45,322
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

1085
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:47,384
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.

1086
01:00:47,462 --> 01:00:49,327
The truth?

1087
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:52,829
The truth. Um...

1088
01:00:54,669 --> 01:00:56,330
The truth is...

1089
01:00:56,438 --> 01:00:59,100
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um...

1090
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,802
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

1091
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:06,513
But I really am a prince.

1092
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:09,106
Why didn't you just tell me?

1093
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:11,880
Well, you know...

1094
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:14,183
royalty going out
into the city in disguise,

1095
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:17,088
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

1096
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:18,853
Hmm.

1097
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:21,418
Not that strange.

1098
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:46,149
Good night, my handsome prince.

1099
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:47,984
Sleep well, Princess.

1100
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:06,570
[sighs]

1101
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:13,747
Yes!

1102
01:02:15,617 --> 01:02:18,177
[sighs]

1103
01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:22,485
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

1104
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:24,320
[yelling, struggling]

1105
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,819
[muffled] Abu. Abu.

1106
01:02:28,897 --> 01:02:30,057
Hold him.

1107
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:38,268
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

1108
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:39,772
[muffled] Why, you...

1109
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:42,105
Make sure he's never found.

1110
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:45,680
[laughing]

1111
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,272
[laughing]

1112
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:28,681
Never fails. Get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

1113
01:03:28,756 --> 01:03:31,316
Hello? Al?

1114
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:34,054
[gasping] Al! Kid, snap out of it.

1115
01:03:34,128 --> 01:03:37,825
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

1116
01:03:37,899 --> 01:03:41,995
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life."' Got it?

1117
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,402
Come on, Aladdin!

1118
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:46,963
I'll take that as a yes.
[imitating alarm]

1119
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:48,906

I...

1125
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:09,956
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

1126
01:04:10,031 --> 01:04:12,261
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

1127
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:14,961
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

[Sultan] Jasmine.

1130
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:27,377
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

1131
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,611
- [Jasmine] I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1132
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:33,051
I have chosen a husband for you.

1133
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:37,057
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

1134
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,719
- [gasping]
- You're speechless, I see.

1135
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,659
A fine quality in a wife.

1136
01:04:41,729 --> 01:04:43,594
I will never marry you.

1137
01:04:43,665 --> 01:04:47,431
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

1138
01:04:47,502 --> 01:04:49,766
Better check your
crystal ball again, Jafar.

1139
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:51,566
- Prince Ali!
- [gasping]

How in the... uh. Awk!

1141
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:57,970
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1142
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,173
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1143
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:03,479
He is obviously lying.

1144
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:06,019
Obviously lying.

1145
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:08,146
Father, what's wrong with you?

1146
01:05:08,222 --> 01:05:10,087
I know what's wrong.

1147
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:13,254
Oh, my!

1148
01:05:13,328 --> 01:05:15,853
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

1149
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,922
[stammering] What? Jafar?

1150
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,968
You, you traitor!

1151
01:05:21,035 --> 01:05:23,265
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.

1152
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:25,203
Guards! Guards!

1153
01:05:25,273 --> 01:05:27,969
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.

1154
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:30,203
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

1155
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:32,712
- [Sultan] Arrest Jafar at once.

[Sultan] Find him!

1159
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:44,557
- [Sultan] Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?

1160
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,615
Yes.

1161
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:48,059
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

1162
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:50,222
plotting against me all this time.

1163
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:52,459
This is horrible, just horrible.

1164
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,763
How will I ever...

1165
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:56,861
Huh?

1166
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:58,700
Can this be true?

1167
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,403
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

1168
01:06:02,477 --> 01:06:05,708
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1169
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:09,816
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1170
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:12,079
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...

1171
01:06:12,153 --> 01:06:14,986
But you two will be wed at once.

1172
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:17,752
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1173
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,056
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1174
01:06:21,129 --> 01:06:22,528
- Sultan?
- [Sultan] Yes.

1175
01:06:22,597 --> 01:06:24,724
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1176
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,267
a person of your
unimpeachable moral character

1177
01:06:27,335 --> 01:06:30,862
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1179
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:34,939
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.

1180
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:36,374
We gotta travel light.

1181
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:39,379
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and how about this picture?

1182
01:06:39,447 --> 01:06:42,245
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

[laughing maniacally]

1184

Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

1185
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,917
Jafar! Jafar!

1186
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:52,391
Get a grip!

1187
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:54,350
Good grip.

1188
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:58,365
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1189
01:06:58,466 --> 01:07:01,663
- He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...

1190
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:04,501
But you are going
to relieve him of it.

1191
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:05,561
Me?

1192
01:07:09,477 --> 01:07:11,411
Sultan?

1193
01:07:11,479 --> 01:07:13,606
They want me to be Sultan?

You just go,

I'm serious.

Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1206
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:59,452
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.

1207

I'm just Aladdin.

- Because of you.

The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1211

What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.

1212

Genie, I can't
keep this up on my own.

I can't wish you free.

Fine. I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.

1215

Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:36,735
Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.

1278
01:11:36,811 --> 01:11:40,008
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1279
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,208
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1280
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:44,080
My order.

1281
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:47,211
Finally, you will bow to me.

1282
01:11:47,288 --> 01:11:49,222
We will never bow to you.

1283
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:51,417
Why am I not surprised?

1284
01:11:51,492 --> 01:11:53,960
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1285
01:11:54,028 --> 01:11:57,225
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!

1286
01:11:57,331 --> 01:11:59,595
Genie, my second wish...

1287
01:11:59,633 --> 01:12:04,036
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!

1288
01:12:05,873 --> 01:12:08,171
- [Jafar laughs maniacally]
- Genie, stop!

1289
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,177
Ladies and gentlemen,

1290
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:16,774
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1291
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:18,842
Now, where were we?

1292
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:23,549
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1293
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:28,895
- Down, boy.
- [meows]

1294
01:12:28,963 --> 01:12:30,225
Oh, Princess.

1295
01:12:30,297 --> 01:12:33,198
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.

1296
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:34,859
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1297
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,926
¦Ä Prince Ali
Yes, it is he

1298
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:39,131
¦Ä But not as you know him

1299
01:12:39,206 --> 01:12:43,438
¦Ä Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

1300
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:46,637
¦Ä Yes, meet a blast from your past

1301
01:12:46,714 --> 01:12:49,205
¦Ä Whose lies were too good to last

1302
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:52,741
¦Ä Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

1303
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,414
Or should we say Aladdin?

1304
01:12:55,523 --> 01:12:56,512
Ali?

1305
01:12:56,557 --> 01:12:59,788
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...

1306
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:04,297
¦Ä So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin

1307
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:06,492
¦Ä Just a con, need I go on

1308
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:08,865
¦Ä Take it from me

1309
01:13:08,936 --> 01:13:11,234
¦Ä His personality flaws

1310
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:13,330
¦Ä Give me adequate cause

1311
01:13:13,407 --> 01:13:16,308
¦Ä To send him packing
On a one-way trip

1312
01:13:16,377 --> 01:13:18,743
¦Ä So his prospects
Take a terminal dip

1313
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:23,978
¦Ä His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!

1314
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:26,451
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

1315
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,547
¦Ä Ex-Prince Ali ¦Ä

1316
01:13:32,026 --> 01:13:33,857
[laughing maniacally]

1317
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,510
[wind howling]

1318
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:55,139
[shivering]

1319
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,243
Abu.

1320
01:13:59,854 --> 01:14:01,515
Abu!

1321
01:14:02,456 --> 01:14:04,424
[Abu whimpering]

1322
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:07,692
Oh, this is all my fault.

1323
01:14:07,761 --> 01:14:11,959
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.

1324
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:15,490
- Are you okay?
- [teeth chattering] Mm-hmm.

1325
01:14:15,569 --> 01:14:17,503
I'm sorry, Abu.

1326
01:14:17,571 --> 01:14:20,301
I made a mess of everything.

1327
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:23,969
Somehow... I gotta go back
and set things right.

1328
01:14:31,485 --> 01:14:33,817
Carpet.

1329
01:14:33,888 --> 01:14:37,016
- [Abu chitters]
- [Aladdin strains]

1330
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,556
Abu, start digging.

1331
01:14:39,627 --> 01:14:40,753
[frantic panting]

1332
01:14:41,996 --> 01:14:43,861
That's it.

1333
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:04,117
Yeah! All right!

1334
01:15:04,185 --> 01:15:06,210
[whines]

1335
01:15:09,356 --> 01:15:12,291
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1336
01:15:15,196 --> 01:15:17,926
- [lago] Puppet ruler want a cracker?
- [Sultan moaning]

1337
01:15:17,998 --> 01:15:20,796
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.

1338
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:22,199
Here. Have lots.

1339
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:25,898
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1340
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:27,873
[growling]

1341
01:15:27,942 --> 01:15:32,003
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1342
01:15:33,914 --> 01:15:36,382
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1343
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:40,318
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

1344
01:15:40,387 --> 01:15:42,321
What do you say, my dear?

1345
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:45,153
Why, with you as my queen...

1346
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:47,285
- Never.
- [enraged growl]

1347
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:50,023
I'll teach you some respect.

1348
01:15:50,097 --> 01:15:51,325
[gasping]

1349
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,994
No. Genie.

1350
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,595
I have decided
to make my final wish.

1351
01:15:58,672 --> 01:16:01,664
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1352
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:04,734
to fall desperately
in love with me.

1353
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:14,510
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quo...

1354
01:16:14,588 --> 01:16:16,647
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.

1355
01:16:16,724 --> 01:16:21,752
[Jafar] You will do what
I order you to do, slave.

1356
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:24,764
[Jasmine] Jafar.

1357
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:30,737
I never realized how...
incredibly handsome you are.

1358
01:16:32,406 --> 01:16:35,170
Mmm. That's better.

1359
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:38,974
Now, pussycat...

1360
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:42,038
tell me more about myself.

1361
01:16:42,116 --> 01:16:45,142
You're tall...

1362
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:47,551
dark...

1363
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:49,646
well dressed...

1364
01:16:49,723 --> 01:16:52,055
Al. Al, little buddy.

1365
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:54,686
Shh.

1366
01:16:56,864 --> 01:16:58,559
Al, I can't help you.

1367
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:01,396
I work for Senor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1368
01:17:01,468 --> 01:17:05,529
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1369
01:17:05,606 --> 01:17:09,167
[Jasmine]...cute little gaps
between your teeth.

1370
01:17:09,243 --> 01:17:11,177
Go on.

1371
01:17:11,245 --> 01:17:13,770
And your beard...

1372
01:17:13,847 --> 01:17:17,010
is so... twisted.

1373
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:22,386
- You've stolen my heart.
- [gasping] Jaf...!

1374
01:17:22,456 --> 01:17:26,153
- [lago mumbling]
- And the street rat?

1375
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:28,956
What street rat?

1376
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:33,624
- [clattering]
- [gasping]

1377
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:36,735
[gasping]

1378
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:38,727
[both] Yech!

1379
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:42,066
That was...

1380
01:17:44,345 --> 01:17:45,334
You!

1381
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:50,706
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1382
01:17:53,654 --> 01:17:55,212
Get the lamp.

1383
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:58,349
No!

1384
01:17:58,425 --> 01:18:01,087
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.

1385
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:03,561
[growling]

1386
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:06,994
Jasmine.

1387
01:18:07,668 --> 01:18:09,829
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1388
01:18:11,372 --> 01:18:13,772
Don't toy with me.

1389
01:18:14,675 --> 01:18:16,302
Abu!

1390
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:19,710
[Jafar] Things are unraveling
fast now, boy.

1391
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,544
[Jafar laughing]

1392
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:24,311
Get the point?

1393
01:18:24,385 --> 01:18:26,148
[laughing]

1394
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,881
[straining]

1395
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,985
I'm just getting warmed up.

1396
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:38,628
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1397
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:38,799
A snake, am l?

1398
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:41,632
A snake, am l?

1399
01:18:41,702 --> 01:18:46,503
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1400
01:19:02,589 --> 01:19:03,851
[screaming]

1401
01:19:03,924 --> 01:19:06,188
¦Ä Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake

1402
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,818
You stay out of this.

1403
01:19:07,895 --> 01:19:11,296
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!

1404
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:17,229
[Jasmine] Aladdin.

1405
01:19:23,444 --> 01:19:24,706
[screams]

1406
01:19:26,747 --> 01:19:29,011
Jasmine, hang on.

1407
01:19:30,551 --> 01:19:34,351
[laughing] You little fool.

1408
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:39,724
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1409
01:19:40,794 --> 01:19:44,059
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1410
01:19:44,131 --> 01:19:48,158
Without the genie, boy,
you're nothing.

1411
01:19:48,235 --> 01:19:51,398
The genie. The genie.

1412
01:19:51,472 --> 01:19:54,339
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1413
01:19:54,408 --> 01:19:55,432
What?

1414
01:19:55,509 --> 01:19:57,909
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1415
01:19:57,978 --> 01:20:00,708
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1416
01:20:00,781 --> 01:20:04,547
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1417
01:20:04,618 --> 01:20:06,984
You're right.

1418
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:10,820
His power does exceed my own.

1419
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,018
But not for long.

1420
01:20:13,093 --> 01:20:16,221
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1421
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:17,888
One too many hits with the snake.

1422
01:20:17,965 --> 01:20:20,866
Slave, I make my third wish.

1423
01:20:20,934 --> 01:20:25,200
I wish to be
an all-powerful genie!

1424
01:20:28,876 --> 01:20:32,642
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1425
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,346
Yes.

1426
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,253
Yes!

1427
01:20:43,323 --> 01:20:44,950
The power.

1428
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:48,017
- [Jafar laughs]
- [Jasmine coughs]

1429
01:20:48,095 --> 01:20:51,963
The absolute power!

1430
01:20:52,799 --> 01:20:55,267
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1431
01:20:56,270 --> 01:21:00,468
The universe is mine to command,
to control!

1432
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:04,372
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1433
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,708
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie...

1434
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,077
you got it.

1435
01:21:08,148 --> 01:21:09,410
What?

1436
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:11,815
And everything that goes with it.

1437
01:21:11,885 --> 01:21:15,446
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1438
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:17,547
[Aladdin] Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1439
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,752
You're the genie. I don't want...

1440
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:22,129
Itty bitty living space.

1441
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:25,421
Al, you little genius, you.

1442
01:21:33,006 --> 01:21:35,065
- Ahh!
- [meow]

1443
01:21:40,314 --> 01:21:42,839
[Jafar] Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1444
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:46,181
- [lago] Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1445
01:21:46,253 --> 01:21:47,584
Allow me.

1446
01:21:47,654 --> 01:21:52,023
10,000 years in a Cave ofWonders
ought to chill him out.

1447
01:21:52,092 --> 01:21:56,324
- [lago yelling, indistinct]
- [Jafar] Shut up!

1448
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,468
Jasmine...

1449
01:22:03,537 --> 01:22:07,029
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1450
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:09,769
I know why you did.

1451
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:12,505
Well, I guess...

1452
01:22:12,579 --> 01:22:15,548
this is good-bye?

1453
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:18,847
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

1454
01:22:18,919 --> 01:22:20,546
I love you.

1455
01:22:20,621 --> 01:22:23,522
[sniffles] Al, no problem.

1456
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:25,558
You've still got one wish left.

1457
01:22:25,626 --> 01:22:27,856
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1458
01:22:27,928 --> 01:22:29,953
But, Genie,
what about your freedom?

1459
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:33,124
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.

1460
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,168
This is love.

1461
01:22:35,235 --> 01:22:39,638
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1462
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:43,540
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.

1463
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,339
Jasmine, I do love you,

1464
01:22:45,412 --> 01:22:49,246
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1465
01:22:49,316 --> 01:22:51,648
I understand.

1466
01:22:53,387 --> 01:22:55,378
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1467
01:22:55,489 --> 01:22:58,549
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1468
01:22:58,592 --> 01:23:02,528
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1469
01:23:22,549 --> 01:23:25,541
I'm free. I'm free.

1470
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:28,144
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1471
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:30,416
Say, "l want the Nile."' Try that.

1472
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:33,288
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1473
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,759
[laughing gleefully]

1474
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:37,422
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1475
01:23:37,497 --> 01:23:40,762
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1476
01:23:40,834 --> 01:23:43,325
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1477
01:23:43,403 --> 01:23:45,132
I'm...

1478
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:54,470
Genie, I'm...

1479
01:23:54,548 --> 01:23:57,142
I'm gonna miss you.

1480
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:00,515
Me, too, Al.
[sniffles]

1481
01:24:00,554 --> 01:24:03,682
No matter
what anybody says,

1482
01:24:03,757 --> 01:24:06,817
you'll always be a prince to me.

1483
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:09,054
That's right.

1484
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:12,064
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1485
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:15,533
It's that law
that's the problem.

1486
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:18,901
- Father?
- Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?

1487
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,564
From this day forth,

1488
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:25,304
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1489
01:24:25,378 --> 01:24:27,846
Him. I choose...

1490
01:24:29,116 --> 01:24:32,483
I choose you, Aladdin.

1491
01:24:33,553 --> 01:24:35,487
Call me Al.

1492
01:24:36,923 --> 01:24:40,154
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.

1493
01:24:40,227 --> 01:24:41,819
Group hug.

1494
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:43,863
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1495
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,261
Ooh, hairball.

1496
01:24:45,332 --> 01:24:48,358
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1497
01:24:48,435 --> 01:24:50,426
I'm outta here!

1498
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:52,938
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1499
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:55,839
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.

1500
01:24:55,942 --> 01:24:57,466
No, I'm mythology.

1501
01:24:57,511 --> 01:25:00,537
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1502
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:06,108
¦Ä A whole new world

1503
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:08,677
¦Ä A whole new life

1504
01:25:08,755 --> 01:25:12,418
¦Ä Foryou and me

1505
01:25:15,095 --> 01:25:17,928
¦Ä A whole new world ¦Ä

1506
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:29,508
[laughing]

1507
01:25:30,977 --> 01:25:32,444
Made you look.
