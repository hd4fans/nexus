Peter?

9
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:30,835
He likes to sleep with the lights on.
Mary, lets go.

10
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,825
Dad.

11
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,180
Be good

12
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:53,381
I have found a safe place for the night
, at Lake Geneva.

13
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,658
Are you uploading it?
Yes, to Roosevelt.

14
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,794
In case we...

15
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:02,059
It'll be fine, Mary.

16
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,582
Did you see his face?
He ​​will never understand.

17
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,791
Mary we've been through this
Our life as we know it is over.

18
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:14,010
We will spend every day from now on
looking over our shoulders...

19
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:16,995
never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

20
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,106
He's just a little boy. I know.
It's going to be alright.

21
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:24,809
It's gonna be alright.

22
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,576
No rest for the weary.
No, I'm afraid not.

23
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,742
Occupational hazard I guess.

24
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,942
What is it you're working on?

25
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:55,561
Just planning ahead.
Do you think I could speak to the pilot?

26
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:59,616
Is there anything you need?
Perhaps I can help.

27
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:03,594
I'd just like to radio ahead, and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

28
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:10,409
I think We both know that's not an option
, Dr. Parker.

Not if you think you can escape.

31
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,087
It's okay.

32
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:08,153
I got you. Are you okay?

33
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:12,527

Good morning, esteemed faculty,
and families of my fellow graduates.

83
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:35,689
It's an honor to be standing up
here today.

84
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:46,775
Hello... I told you,
I am running a bit late.

85
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,660
I saw the Spider

86
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:52,238
I know that we all think we're immortal
.

87
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:56,171
We're supposed to feel.
That way, We've graduated.

88
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:59,255
Like our three, four years
years in high school...

89
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:04,284
what makes life valuable, is
that it doesn't last forever.

90
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,063
What makes the passage is that it ends.

91
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:11,710
We know that now more than ever.

92
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,876
<i>And I say it...</i>

93
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,156
<i>today of all days</i>

94
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:19,509
. = =
To remind us that time is luck.

95
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>So don't waste it, living someone elses
life.</i>

96
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,547
Make yours count for something.

97
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:33,402
Fight for what matters to you,
no matter what.

98
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,074
And even if we fall short...

99
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,796
what better way is there to live?

100
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,054
Alright

101
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,990
I'll take that Thats my room.

102
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,389
This is not over, Spider

103
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,146
Peter Parker

104
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,798
I think I know that guy.

105
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,657
Peter Parker.

106
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,003
Sorry.

107
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:49,701
Wait, do it again.

108
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,973
I was so happy myself.

109
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,869
I'd like to have seen that.
No, no, no

110
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:02,086
I am so proud of you.
Were you?...I'm so proud of you

111
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:06,773
I know the first thing Uncle Ben
would say... I know to.

112
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:10,901
"You got to hurry up the party's over.
You gotta go out and get a job."

113
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:14,787
And then he would say: "Don't just
follow the path. Make your own trail."

114
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,915
"Ralph Waldo Emerson... no?"

115
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,060
He said he'd made it up.

116
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,975
You really did learn something here.

117
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:29,623
I wish your uncle could have been here.

118
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:34,705
Yeh me too. And my folks.

119
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,672

Don't go too far away.
Good to see you. Alright.

125
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:07,105
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian mob...

126
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:10,192
and machine guns?

127
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,436
Why don't you just tell me?
When you going to give a speech.

128
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,857
Gwen. Honey, family photos. Okay

129
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:20,557

You can't keep me away.

130
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:24,111
Its at eight o'clock. Don't be late.
I'm hungry.

131
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,478
I am going to domesticate you.

132
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:33,746
Alright I want to hear it all night long.
Over and over again, all night long.

133
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,817
That was pretty good.
Peter, join us.

134
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:44,191
I have to find my aunt, I gotta find my
aunt. But I may catch up later. Thank you.

135
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:53,306
<i>You will make enemies.
People will get hurt.</i>

136
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,618
<i>You have to promise me something kid </
i></i>

137
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:01,053
Leave Gwen out of this.

138
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:05,171
<i>Promise me that.</i>

139
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,750
Peter's outside.

140
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:29,826
Peter.

141
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,599
What is it?

142
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,901
Whats wrong? Are you alright?

143
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,456
I don't know what I'm doing.

144
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,006
Its my my father, right?

145
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,032
Yes, I see him everywhere I go

146
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:53,669
I don't know what to do.
I can't get him out of my head.

147
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:56,779
I thought We'd talked about this.
Yeah, I know...

148
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,009
It's not his choice.

149
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:03,203
I promised him that I would
keep away from you.

150
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,161
And now I'm gonnna come
and eat dinner with your family.

151
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,308
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

152
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,022
I don't know I've got No idea.

153
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,884
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

154
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,898
I thought that it would make you love me?
I do love you.

155
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,480
I love you.

156
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,446
Then why isn't that enough? Hmm.

157
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:35,182
What if something happens to you, just
like it happened to him, because of me?

158
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:38,628
No, wait.

159
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,667
I cannot let that happen.

160
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,585
You are Spider-Man...

161
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,484
and I like that.

162
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,021
But I love Peter Parker more.

163
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,802
Thats worth it to me.

164
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,380
I cannot lose you too.

165
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:04,253
Because you do not want,
we can't be together?

166
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,954
Why are we here?

167
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:13,210
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

168
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,451
You have done this to me...

169
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:24,374
Again, again... Peter

170
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,521
I can't live like that.

171
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:31,872
I break up with you.

172
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,265
I broke up with you.

173
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,840

191
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,722
I'd love to know who's behind that mask.

192
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,245
- Nice outfit.

193

<i>We have a caller on the line called named

194
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,492
<i>Listen I'm upset.. Spider-Man
to me is being misunderstood.</i>

195
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,863

00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:20,263
Is not it someone's birthday today?

What are you doing?
Did you make a cake?

231
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:51,335
People do not see the little
things that you do for others.

232
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,746
I know what they say about you in the
press, but it doesn't matter to me.

233
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,788
Because I know the real you.
Because You're amazing.

234
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,720
That's what the press needs.

235
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:03,848
They should call you the
amazing Spider-Man '.

236
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:07,957
You like this, Spidey?

Good... Because today is going
to be amazing.

238
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,050
Circuit break

239
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:24,658
I'm not late.
I'll be there in fifteen minutes.

240
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:28,795
I just wanna know if you can find another
waitress to replace me.

241
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,492
Because I start my training, up at
the hospital.

242
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:36,074
But don't mention this to Peter.
Because he worries.

243
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:41,693
Yeh.yeh, Okay you got it. Double
shift on Thursday. Okay bye.

244
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,526
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

245
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:50,846
- A double shift huh?
- Sometimes.

246
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:53,401
I have nothing else to do
I like the girls.

247
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,967
I miss Ben, give me a little
extra, in my cookie jar.

248
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:02,239
I have some, another couple of photos
from the bugle so that outa help.

249
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:05,250
It would really help if that guy
would give me a fair wage

250
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:09,630
Jameson pays me a fair wage,
as it was in 1961.

251
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,963
HEY, HEY, wait. Where you
going? What are you going?

00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,713
I'm doing my laundry.
No, I do the laundry.

00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:20,001
Its my job, I've been doing your
laundry since you were six years old.

254
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:24,562
I'm in college now, its time I took
care of my own dirty underwear.

255
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,456
The last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red.

256
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,016
That was a mistake.
I was washing the American flag.

257
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:34,926
No one washes the flag.

258
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:38,935
I do, I wont anymore fine
It's just underwear.

259
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:43,487
This is my laundry, my home
my machine. Eat your breakfast.

260
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,032
Alright laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

261
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,682
I'll do it. Give it.
No, I'll do it another time.

262
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,577
- Excuse me.
- Idiot.

263
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:59,269

and you've thrown it all away.

311
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,878
You threw me away.

312
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,810
You sent me to boarding
when I was eleven.

313
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:11,491
On my 16th birthday...

314
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:15,817
you sent me Scotch.
Or one of your assistants did.

315
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,912
I'm pretty sure, there
was the card: In it.

316
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,961
With compliments. Norman Osborn.

317
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:27,858
I don't. Expect forgiveness
from you

318
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,656
I don't believe in miracles.

319
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:34,970
How could you possibly
understand...

320
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:38,698
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

321
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,177
for something greater?

322
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:45,258
Not just for me. For you.

323
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:50,488
Are your hands starting to twitch yet?

324
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:56,412
When you lay awake...

325
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,783
Hiding under your skin...

326
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:02,873
waiting to show itself.

327
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,119
To show you who you really are.

328
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,952
Retroviral hyperplasia.

329
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:19,263
I never told you...

330
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:22,517
But its genetic.

331
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,520
Our disease.

332
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,538
The Osborn curse.

333
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,774
When it began at your age.

334
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:35,999
Let me see it.

335
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:40,066
Your hand, give it to me.

336
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:50,819
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

337
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:54,150
is not money.

338
00:32:54,847 --> 00:33:02,479
Told you about my work.

339
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:05,397
Perhaps you can succeed...

340
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,130
where I failed.

341
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:20,083
BEST MR JAMESON NEW PHOTOS ADDED

WRONG

345
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:35,812
<i>Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries has died.</i>

346
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:37,459
<i>The Osborn estate has confirmed </

347
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:41,242
<i>He is survived by his only son, Harry
Osborn, who is the sole heir...</i>

348
00:33:41,577 --> 00:33:44,296
<i>of the Oscorp corporate empire..</i>

349
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:48,458
<i>Osborn fundamentaly changed the medical
professions approach to human healing...</i>

350
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:51,034
<i>And affected the lives of millions
.</i>

351
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,429
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought.</i>

352
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:58,566
<i>"We can do better.
We should do better. ".</i>

353
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:04,206
<i>Einstein said the world can not be changed,
without changing our thinking.</i>

354
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:07,056
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

355
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:12,817
<i>It begins with hard work. Change begins
with persistence and commitment.</i>

356
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,183
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

357
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:21,105
Now its up to each of us to ensure that
his hopes and dreams remain alive.

358
00:34:21,298 --> 00:34:22,932
But not today.

359
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:25,846
- Today...
- Hello?

360
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:28,551
<i>I speaking with Gwen Stacy
Yeah, who's calling?</i>

361
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:32,968
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford college
program we have some exiting news</i>

362
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:39,795

363
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:43,072
Theres a current flow problem in genomics
lab.Why don't you go take a Look at that.

364
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:46,075
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving, Why do I haveto stay?

365
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:49,959
Because you're special. Smythe...

366
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,737
Happy birthday.

<i>Production of electricity by

369
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:05,306
Hi guys.

370
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:08,327
Someone loves a party.

371
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,157
You're just a little queasy.

372
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:14,185
I got your medicine.

373
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:20,447
And on my birthday.
After all I've done for this company.

374
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:23,251
<i>Warning.</i>

375
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,624
<i>Error in sector 5A
It's just reflux...</i>

376
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:31,176
Did you know my birthday, Kari? Get
you to sing "Happy Birthday" for me?

377
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:33,358
Then I'll just have to sing
it to myself.

378
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:38,554
Gilbert, its Max. Can you shut
down power in sector 32, please?

379
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:41,838
<i>Forget it I'm out the door.. What

<i>Sorry, Max</i>

381
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:49,821
I'll do it myself.
And I'll sing to myself.

382
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:57,618
Happy Birthday... To me.

383
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,054
Happy Birthday.

384
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:13,157

<i>System restored Have a nice day.</i>

386
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:59,792
Harry, Oscorps are under intense public scrutiny,
in the wake of Dr. Connors recent breach of trust.

387
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:04,913
You mean, people are pisssed off because he
tried to turn everyone into giant lizards?

388
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:08,269
Given that...

389
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:12,139
all the animals hybrids programs he
was involved in were destroyed...

390
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,548
to restore investor confidence.

391
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:19,023
That is, the Osborn way.

392
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:22,835
If somethings inconvenient round
here just get rid of it, right?

393
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,436
Much of that statemen may fall on
you now.

394
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,149
You sell a plausible deniability as
your best option... Sure, sure.

395
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,180
A twenty-year-old kid.
A 200 billion dollar company.

396
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,293
What was Dad thinking?

397
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:41,677
I mean You're all lawyers...
Right!

398
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:46,273
Surely someone must have questioned his
sanity in the end.

399
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:49,995
Someone must have thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

400
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,005
It would have made this conversation,
a lot easier... Harry...

401
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,336
It's Mr. Osborn.

402
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,061
We're not friends.

403
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,512
Hii.

404
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:12,073
You were his assistant, right?

405
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,025
What is your name?
Felicia... Felicia.

406
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:26,253
From now on, everybody at this table
will? Felicia.

407
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,107
Because Felicia works for me.

408
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:33,768
Would anybody like to speak up??

409
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:39,445
Well good. Then you can all
keep your jobs, for a while.

410
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:43,806
Sir... There's Peter Parker
that you would like to speak to you

411
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:54,878
Felicia, I want to see every
file on this list.

412
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:57,800
Every single one.

413
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:10,324
Peter Parker.
It's like seeing a ghost.

414
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:12,773
Hi, Harry.

415
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:15,001
So random.

416
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:18,461
- Its ten years.
- Eight.

417
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:20,663
Close.

418
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:25,003
So, how you doing kid.

419
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:28,174
I heard about your Dad and I wanted
to... Come and..

420
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,629
To check it out, To see how you're doing.

421
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:34,793
I'm with some people.

422
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:41,468
I'm in a meeting.

423
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:45,527
Sorry I didn't want to intrude,
I know it's been a long time.

424
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,411
I know exactly what you're going through.
.

425
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:51,569
And you were so there for me when my
parents...

426
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,336
Thats why I'm here.

427
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:56,639
Thank you.

428
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,322
It was good to see you man.

429
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:04,600
Very good.

430
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,134
Sorry about your Dad.

431
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:13,251
You've got your braces on.

432
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:20,102
Now it is all your focus back on your
one eyebrow.

433
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,574
There it is.

434
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:27,231
There it is.

435
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,248
Does someone dry your
hair every morning?

436
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:35,317
One of my main servants
hold the hair dryer...

437
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,618
But I work the comb.

438
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:41,660
Okay, so at least I'm not completely
helpless.

439
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:52,729
After graduation I went
to Brazil and Singapore.

440
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,665
- And then Europe.
- I saw you.

441
00:40:58,278 --> 00:40:59,788
What do you mean? You saw.

442
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:03,842
I saw you in some magazine with some French
supermodel, You know what I'm talking about?

443
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:10,662
The whole model thing is
so exhausting. I know.

444
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:13,815
What?

445
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:16,195
Do you have a girl?

446
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:22,648
Thats a question.

447
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,911
Thats a question.

448
00:41:27,594 --> 00:41:29,359
No, I'm not a girl.

449
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,112
I don't know.

450
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,624
It's complicated.

451
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:41,884
Yeh I don't do complicated.

452
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,985
So What's her name? Who is she?

453
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:49,291
Her name is Gwen. Gwen Stacy.

454
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:53,032
- Gwen Stacy?
- She works for you.

455
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:54,902
Really?

456
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:58,551
She's an intern Oscorp.
Is she a model employee?

457
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:05,470
When my father sent away me I tried to
forget everything about this place..

458
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,183
I guess that kind of
includes you.

459
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,594
You don't have to explain to me.
Bro.

460
00:42:16,924 --> 00:42:18,817
We both got dumped.

461
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:24,420
Did you ever figure out why your parents
bailed?

462
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,139
My Dad left a briefcase.

463
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,009
Thats all I got a briefcase full of junk.

464
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:37,660
I try not to think about it.
Hows that working out for you?

465
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:39,717
Perfect.

466
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:48,636
What a throw.

467
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:50,672
Its just the wrist.Its just all in the
wrist buddy.

468
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,507
<i>You can do it with some strength.</i>

469
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:58,913
Things have gottne crazy around here man.

470
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,462
<i>Giant lizards, and...</i>

471
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:04,013
Spider-Guy.

472
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,775
There's just one guy,
just one Spider-Man.

473
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:12,720
Or woman.
We don't know for sure.

474
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,656
He ​wears spandex to rescues kittens from
trees.

475
00:43:17,537 --> 00:43:19,629
Very impressive.

476
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:23,538
I think he just gives people hope.
For what?

477
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:26,591
That eventually everything gonna
be alright.

478
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:29,651
I wish I had time for eventually.

479
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:37,739
Who was he? Maxwell Dillon,
electrical engineer.

480
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,715
No associates or friends to speak of.

481
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,309
He ​​submitted specs for the grid,
that we... appropriated.

482
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:47,563
He was invisible.

483
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,567
Wall Street's nervous enough that
child having taken over the company.

484
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,910
We've got to find a way to get him out.

485
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:59,589
In the meantime the press gets hold of this
accident. Our stock will?

486
00:43:59,424 --> 00:44:03,858
So make sure that this Mr. Dillon
still remains invisible.

487
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,372
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

488
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,623
Hi.

489
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:45,604
Move.

490
00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:58,646
Hey!

491
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,547
You look amazing.

492
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,645
I'm sorry for the spontaneous...

493
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,387
Spontaneous is...

494
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,766
Its how I feel.
I just figured it was time.

495
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:23,813
Time we try to be friends.

496
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:30,595
Friends, yeah, that's...

497
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:32,916
awesome.

498
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,209
I don't want this to be complicated.

499
00:46:35,244 --> 00:46:39,453
I hate complicated.
Keep it simple.

500
00:46:40,357 --> 00:46:45,543
Okay great. Yeh, yeh. But...
I mean.

501
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:52,182
Look If we're friends,
we gotta establish some ground rules.

502
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:54,195
Basic Rules?

503
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:57,567
- Like that.
- Like what?

504
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:01,340
That laugh.

505
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,123
This should not.

506
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:07,420
You must annoying laugh.

507
00:47:09,373 --> 00:47:11,342
That's still adorable.

508
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:15,206
That was not adorable.

509
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:20,023
Okay I've got one.
What? What is it.

510
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,365
Don't tell me that I look amazing..

511
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:27,716
With your big brown doe eyes.

512
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:30,710
I really mean it.

513
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:33,607
No..No... What

514
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:37,085
I've just figured out the next
ground rule.

515
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,848
Do more of this.

516
00:47:39,013 --> 00:47:42,912
The nose rub.

517
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:46,407
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

518
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:50,522
I can not stand. I'm gone.

519
00:47:50,556 --> 00:47:52,152
Come on.

520
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:55,825
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

521
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,412
I have done it.

522
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:42,005
And as I completely addicted to this
place that has Korean meatballs.

523
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:44,364
Are you going to eat?
It's great.

524
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,967
On 6th Street. I know
You will love it there.

525
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:50,828
How do you know?

526
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,609
How do you know I love it there?

527
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,660
Cos hmm.

528
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,828
You told me.

529
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:07,006
It just opened last month.

530
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:13,101
Did you follow me?

531
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:21,177
I knew it. How often?

532
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:27,927
Just once a day. Sometimes.

533
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,952
Sometimes more.

534
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,296
Why?

535
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,412
To watch me? ...Yeh.

536
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,696
And because its the closest
I could get to you.

537
00:50:04,775 --> 00:50:06,997
I'm moving to England.

538
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:17,543
What?...Yeh.

539
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:23,255
I have a scholarship at Oxford.

540
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:25,155
In molecular medicine.

541
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:28,956
It's between me and this other kid.and
there's this oral exam... We need to do

542
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,962
and he's like a freshman
in college, but he's 14 years.

543
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,848
He can possibly be,
but I can be.

544
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:40,301
And then I have to move to England.

545
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:44,636
I'm really excited.

546
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:48,056
That's...

547
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,360
England?

548
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:54,251
I need reinforcements.

549
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:57,936
Send patrol cars to the southend
corner of Duffy Square.

550
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:03,717
Everyone get out the way please.
Get out the way.

551
00:52:03,563 --> 00:52:07,190
Remove your hands from the cables.

552
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,719
Get your hands away
from the cables.

553
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:12,033
Let me see your hands.

554
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:16,685
Stay right where you are.
Do not move.

555
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,118
Freeze. Get down, on the ground.

556
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:38,685
Get down on the ground now.

557
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,675
- Stop.
- On the floor.

558
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:44,535
It's not my fault. Stop.

559
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,218
Please...

560
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:54,084
My goodness.

561
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:57,922
They see me standing. They see me.

562
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:03,203
They see me.

563
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:18,167
No... Stop. Don't do that.

564
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:19,855
Please.

565
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:22,384
Wait, it's not my fault.

566
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,637
It's not my fault.

567
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,635
I said, stop.

568
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,044
I'm glad your not one of those
cops that rides a horse.

569
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,340
Team members... Hold your fire and wait for
my call.

570
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:53,836
Hold your fire, I repeat hold
your fire. And stay down.

571
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:59,339
Stop. Stop it well, Sparkle.

572
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:02,730
Hey..How are you doing?

573
00:54:02,895 --> 00:54:07,081
It's You. Well I know its me,
Who are you?

574
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:12,094
You don't remember me?
No, should I?

575
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,328
I walked into the street, the car
almost hit me. You swung me up.

576
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:20,123
You saved me.
You said you needed me.

577
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:24,297
The guy, you're the guy with the
Blue-prints... Yes, Blue-prints

578
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:29,056
I remember you, course I remember
you, your my eyes and ears.

579
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,120
What's your name again?
How could you forget me?

580
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:35,890
I do, I know. I know it, don't tell me...
It's Max. Is it Max?

581
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:37,265
Yes

582
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:41,413
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you with...
You look different.

583
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,200
How are you?

584
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:47,710
I don't know what's going on
with me... I believe you.

585
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:53,059
Its strange.
I have so much strength.

586
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,249
I have so much anger.

587
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:58,495
I can see that, you don't want
to be here You're scared.

588
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:02,002
You don't know whats happening, to you, I can
see that you don't want to hurt anybody.

589
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,009
You'll be alright. I've got a clear shot.
Standing by.

590
00:55:05,044 --> 00:55:06,966
They're not going to shooy you.

591
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,969
Guys, this is my buddy Max.

592
00:55:08,994 --> 00:55:13,462
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max.

593
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:16,678
It's just between you and me talkin. Whoahh...
Stay right there, stay right there.

594
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:19,806
Be careful with the grid
and the electricity.

595
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,560
I just wanted them to all see me.

596
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,042
<i>If he makes a move,
take that shot.</i>

597
00:55:26,077 --> 00:55:30,422
Come with me, somewhere we'll talk
away from all these people... Okay.

598
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,691
NO... Stop.

599
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:00,431
Spidey.

600
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:04,566
You..Queer.

601
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:12,759
Electric idiot.

602
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:19,758
<i>He lied to me, he shot me...</i>

603
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,523
Shut up.

604
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,466
You're so selfish.

605
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:29,378
Stay with me Max.

606
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:32,134
You set me up.
No..I didn't set you up.

607
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,282
You lied to me. No, I'm trying
to help you, let me help you.

608
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,955
It's my birthday.

609
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:36,621
And now Its time for me to light up
candles.

610
00:58:53,435 --> 00:58:55,677
Can anyone see Spider-Man?

611
00:58:56,571 --> 00:58:59,433
Can anyone see Spider-Man?

612
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:11,888
That's enough.

613
00:59:12,613 --> 00:59:15,745
Mike. Big John.

614
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:20,390
Nice work fella's. It was a
pleasure doing business with you.

615
00:59:27,496 --> 00:59:30,078
Spider-Man...

616
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:37,775
England?

617
00:59:39,028 --> 00:59:40,611
Really?

618
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:51,889
That's hot.

619
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:14,321
Our coverage of a breaking story begins
with Jessica Abo, at the scene.

620
01:00:14,346 --> 01:00:18,331
We're staying here with two eyewitnesses,
who are going to tell what they just saw.

621
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:21,963
So tell us How did the Spider-Man
do it. How did he beat this creature.

622
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:26,091
Its got to be rubberised, Spideys suit
thats why he didn't get electrocuted.

623
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:28,765
Probably neoprene.

624
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,464
Thank you very much, the two of you
so many questions remain unanswered..

625
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,449
WHAT IS ROOSEVELT?

626
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:18,104
DO I HAVE TO LOSE YOU TOO????

627
01:02:26,966 --> 01:02:31,659
Online polls show a sudden upset of public
sentiment in favourof the wall-crawler.

628
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:35,528
Tonight it would seem the city owes him
a debt of gratitude.

629
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,448
Next generation of
military body armor.

630
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:13,536
Features include enhanced
mobility, battlefield injury repair.

631
01:03:13,605 --> 01:03:15,995
Nervous system interface.

632
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:28,568
So the common household spider,
and merged human cells.

633
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:31,918
Have contained the power
to self heal...

634
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:35,031
From severe infection, tissue damage.

635
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:39,547
We used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA..

636
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:45,580
Welcome to, Dr. Jallings science
investigator.

637
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:48,385
Today we're going to be talking about
electricity. Very interesting.

638
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:51,298
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic current.

639
01:03:51,723 --> 01:03:54,384
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming current.

640
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:57,565
The more powerful the battery, the
bigger the current it can withstand.

641
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:02,295
If the incoming charge,
exeeds the outgoing charge.

642
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:06,858
The battery might explode.
EXPLODE.!!!

643
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:12,727
Doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

644
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,567
We need a bigger power.

645
01:04:56,523 --> 01:04:59,791
Hello? Pete its me.

646
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:05,157
Hello, Harry. What time is it?

647
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:09,238
Late. I dunno.
I've been up all night.

648
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:12,465
I need to see you.
You alright...?

649
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:14,354
Not really Pete.

650
01:05:14,522 --> 01:05:18,756
I'm dying... But I think you can help
save my life.

651
01:05:20,306 --> 01:05:24,801
Your looking at the world's first
Human-Spider hybrid.

652
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:28,047
In the hope is to extract the venom
from their glands.

653
01:05:28,172 --> 01:05:33,404
Turn that into a cure, an agent
That heals diseased cells.

654
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:35,828
And If I can be cured...

655
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:41,051
Imagine what this could do for other
diseases like Alzheimer's even cancer..

656
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:47,374
They never made it to
human trials.

657
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:51,460
14 years of research, and nothing
to show for it.

658
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:56,650
Except maybe this.

659
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:07,830
- Spider-Man.
- What about him?

660
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:11,446
He was bitten by one of
those things and it worked.

661
01:06:12,028 --> 01:06:15,713
I don't know how and I
don't know why... But

662
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:22,287
he can do everything else a spider can..
Including Self heal.

663
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,579
I need to find him.

664
01:06:24,955 --> 01:06:26,810
I need his blood.

665
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:46,633
You drink Spider-Man's blood?

666
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:54,877
It will save my life.
It may not Harry.

667
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,146
It's not that simple.

668
01:06:57,245 --> 01:07:00,767
Look what happened to Curt Connors.
Connors was weak.

669
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,620
This is me Peter.

670
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:07,902
Why do not you put it in the newspaper,
help him donate?

671
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:12,571
I'm sure he's sensitive to people shoving
needles...

672
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,613
Sensitive?

673
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:19,576
Well then you could just sensitive me,
tell me where he is.

674
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:22,994
And I will go ask him myself...
No.

675
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:30,440
You took his picture.
So you know him.

676
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:36,136
I took a picture from a long way away,
it was a long lens. I don't know him.

677
01:07:37,738 --> 01:07:40,857
Together you said at the river.

678
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:44,974
How he gives people hope.

679
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,573
Come on.

680
01:07:51,406 --> 01:07:53,582
DATABASE BY START SEARCH

681
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,533
SEARCH USER

682
01:07:59,148 --> 01:08:00,741
NAME NOT FOUND

683
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:05,592
SEARCH BLOCKED

684
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:09,833
Just say yes.

685
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:18,462
Don't turn your back on me.

686
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,776
I do not want to end up like my father.
Peter.

687
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:25,793
Please.

688
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:29,251
Peter, please.

689
01:08:39,795 --> 01:08:44,020
I will try and find Spider-Man.

690
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:57,151
What does the security here?

691
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,230
Wait. Miss Stacy.

692
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:29,928
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

693
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:42,771
She's not here.
Look on another floor.

694
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:46,203
You in trouble?? Who's that man?

695
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,355
There was an accident,
they are trying to cover it up.

696
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:52,834
When I found out, that guy
from Times Square Last week...

697
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:56,354
I met him, he was and an
electrical engineer..

698
01:09:56,423 --> 01:09:59,286
He would Spider-Man love it.

699
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:03,327
Because I got the feeling,
that he wanted to kill me.

700
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:05,700
How it feels to love you.

701
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:09,451
I visited him in the computer,
but everything was cleared about him.

702
01:10:09,617 --> 01:10:12,303
Totally glossed over.
Typically Oscorp.

703
01:10:12,974 --> 01:10:17,502
Why are you here?
Harry, he's dying.

704
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:19,739
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

705
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:24,964
And He thinks Spider-Man's blood can save
his life. My blood and Spider-mans blood.

706
01:10:25,089 --> 01:10:27,689
As far as I know, if I give it to
him, it could kill him.

707
01:10:27,714 --> 01:10:29,561
Or worse.

708
01:10:31,754 --> 01:10:34,185
This is a maintenance closet.
Gwen!

709
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,707
The most? Hiding place
you could have chosen.

710
01:10:37,977 --> 01:10:39,627
I'm... sorry.

711
01:10:39,639 --> 01:10:44,167
This hiding place could
take us to the Bahamas.

712
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:48,148
We need to talk about England,
because I do not want...

713
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:01,020
You kissed me. I'm sorry,
I couldn't help it.

714
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:03,153
How did you like it?

715
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:07,411
- It felt a bit rushed.
- I know.

716
01:11:07,492 --> 01:11:10,973
This is the plan. Get the elevator,
while I distract him.

717
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:45,554
I'm sorry... I'm all thumbs today

718
01:11:50,427 --> 01:11:52,407
Gwen Stacy

719
01:11:57,003 --> 01:12:00,882
I'm Harry... Yeh

720
01:12:01,728 --> 01:12:05,533
I'm an old friend of Peters.
Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

721
01:12:05,604 --> 01:12:07,447
I was funny rushing...

722
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:12,439
I'm sorry he never mentioned.
I thought you two had broken up.

723
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:18,627
Yeh, yeh, we have but it's...

724
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:20,759
Complicated.

725
01:12:21,126 --> 01:12:25,991
Everythings always
complicated with Peter.

726
01:12:28,129 --> 01:12:32,255
That's right. But
that's why he needs you.

727
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,138
Right?

728
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:40,192
To help him make his choices
clear.

729
01:12:43,348 --> 01:12:48,009
Nice meeting you. Yeh
It was a pleasure.

730
01:12:59,654 --> 01:13:03,390
RAVENSCROFT INSTITUTE

731
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:46,742
You've had a terrible accident.

732
01:13:48,742 --> 01:13:53,327
I'm Dr. Kafka.
I'm here to help you.

733
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:55,492
Of course, Doctor.

734
01:13:56,289 --> 01:14:00,439
Thats why you prepared
military grade, Biostim electrodes.

735
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:05,764
High intensity capacitors.
The kind they make at Oscorp.

736
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:08,738
All this because you're trying to help me.

737
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:10,385
You are correct.

738
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,413
I'm here to study you.

739
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:17,318
To understand what you are, and why
.

740
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:19,874
I will get results.

741
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:27,086
I always do.

742
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:33,612
Do you realize you'll lock me in a
prison...

743
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:37,636
powered by electricity?

744
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:44,404
I feel it in the walls.
In my veins.

745
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:49,008
What you do. You can't contain.

746
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:53,427
It's a force of nature. Like me.

747
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:03,005
Want to know how powerful I am?
Yes.

748
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:05,577
Well so do I..

749
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:08,864
GOOD, ,,GOOD

750
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:13,265
I'm dying to know.

751
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:18,948
You'd better make damn sure that you
kill me. Because if you don't..

752
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:21,625
I'm gonnna kill the light.

753
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:26,364
Everyone in this city, will discover
how it feels, to live in my world.

754
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:32,298
A world without power.
A world without mercy.

755
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:35,905
A world without Spider-Man.

756
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:40,209
And everyone will see me
who or what.

757
01:15:40,795 --> 01:15:42,809
Who are you?

758
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:47,376
Don't you know? I am Electro.

759
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:55,738
<i>Warning . Electrical capacity reaches
escape.</i>

760
01:15:55,774 --> 01:15:58,624
Initiate lockdown
procedure, immmediately.

761
01:15:59,248 --> 01:16:03,805
Very impressive, Electro.

762
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:06,544
Lockdown began.

763
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,682
Aunt May?

764
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,835
What are you doing?
When did you do this?

765
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:40,547
There's something your not
telling me, Aunt May.

766
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:44,019
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

767
01:16:44,503 --> 01:16:47,546
I know you're not telling me something.
You're lying to me.

768
01:16:47,571 --> 01:16:51,113
I know you love me... I don't. I
know you love me..But you do.

769
01:16:52,118 --> 01:16:56,236
Tell me. It's my father.

770
01:16:56,397 --> 01:16:58,023
Yes, he was your father...

771
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:02,884
but that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you.

772
01:17:04,178 --> 01:17:06,342
I need the truth.

773
01:17:08,032 --> 01:17:10,888
The truth is that your parents left you
here, on our door-step.

774
01:17:11,052 --> 01:17:15,455
This little boy whose world was turned
upside down with no explanation.

775
01:17:15,624 --> 01:17:18,940
We did the best, we could.

776
01:17:19,003 --> 01:17:20,855
You Uncle Ben, he and I.

777
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:24,587
Who else was going to care for you and
protect you? And worries about you.

778
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:27,022
Your father? No.

779
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:31,824
I was the one who wiped your nose,
who made you brush your teeth...

780
01:17:31,849 --> 01:17:34,574
and do your homework. And washed
your dirty underwear. ME!!

781
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,750
You stupid, nonscientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

782
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:44,737
who has to take nursing classes, with 22 year old
kids, so I can pay for you to go to college.

783
01:17:44,805 --> 01:17:48,368
And I don't know how to do
this without Ben. I don't know how.

784
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,391
And you're dreaming about your perfect
father...

785
01:17:52,561 --> 01:17:55,286
Who was never here. NO!

786
01:17:56,457 --> 01:17:59,580
No I wont tell you.
You're my boy.

787
01:17:59,905 --> 01:18:04,843
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.
And I wont hurt you

788
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:16,950
I'm your boy.
You're my everything.

789
01:18:18,352 --> 01:18:24,370
You're more than enough.
That's not what this is about.

790
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:28,732
- I love you so much.
- I know.

791
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:37,695
It's okay.

792
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,210
Aunt May...

793
01:18:44,117 --> 01:18:46,298
I need to know.

794
01:18:50,957 --> 01:18:52,530
Alright.

795
01:18:55,785 --> 01:18:58,007
I'll tell you everything I know.

796
01:19:00,713 --> 01:19:03,664
But It will hurt you. Okay.

797
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,012
A few days after the funeral...

798
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:13,918
The government men.
Came to see us.

799
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:18,801
They said, the genetic research...

800
01:19:18,827 --> 01:19:22,490
That your father was doing with
Norman Osborn, was very valuable.

801
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:27,594
And that people would pay a lot for it.
And thats why he ran off with it.

802
01:19:27,841 --> 01:19:31,556
They said he was a traitor.
I couldn't believe it.

803
01:19:32,045 --> 01:19:36,605
They told us he betrayed his best
friend for, all of us, for the money.

804
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:43,559
I don't understand..

805
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:47,316
Yes, I know.
I didn't believe it.

806
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,759
This doesn't make any sense..
Peter... I don't know how.

807
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:57,143
For so long. I would play it over and over in
my head, what had I missed. What had I missed.

808
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:03,130
He was just a normal unasuming guy. He wore
the same ratty lab coat for 20 years...

809
01:20:03,355 --> 01:20:06,124
He took the D train to work,
at seven every morning...

810
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:08,472
came home at 6 every night.

811
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:10,952
I don't know.

812
01:20:11,448 --> 01:20:14,715
Maybe everyone has a part of
themself, to hide...

813
01:20:15,624 --> 01:20:18,088
Even from the people they love.

814
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,442
Mr. Osborn.

815
01:20:40,232 --> 01:20:44,626
Look up.
You were looking for me.

816
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,162
I do not believe my eyes.

817
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:51,401
Spider-Man.

818
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,476
Just the man I wanted to see.

819
01:21:03,582 --> 01:21:08,799
You ah, talked to Peter? ...Yep

820
01:21:15,193 --> 01:21:19,137
I want to help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

821
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:23,959
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

822
01:21:24,084 --> 01:21:27,985
- Pardon?
- It's too dangerous.

823
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:32,359
If our blood is not compatible,
you could die.

824
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,566
I'm already dying.

825
01:21:35,406 --> 01:21:40,150
Your blood can give me time.
But it could do something worse.

826
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:43,329
Okay.

827
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,910
Alright How much?

828
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:49,222
- What?
- How much do you want?

829
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:53,939
A boat or plane? Or
Money? How much do you want?

830
01:21:54,565 --> 01:21:57,877
I don't want your money.
Everybody wants my money

831
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,650
I don't.

832
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:06,364
I thought you saved people.

833
01:22:07,037 --> 01:22:10,728
I thought thats what you do.
Is you save peoples lives.

834
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:13,802
You just gonna let me die.

835
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:17,095
I'm trying to protect you.
Right now.

836
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:20,291
You're trying to protect yourself.

837
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:25,030
Look..We just need
a bit more time...

838
01:22:25,255 --> 01:22:27,872
I have no time. Get out

839
01:22:34,764 --> 01:22:36,399
I'm sorry.

840
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:47,148
You're a fraud, Spider-Man.

841
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:06,580
Can I to talk to you for a second.
I'm running late. Right now.

842
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:09,879
It only takes a minute.

843
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:13,587
Give me some time.
One thing. Then I'm gone.

844
01:23:13,612 --> 01:23:14,662
It's a mess.

845
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:17,371
My Dad my mum,
everything my father done lies.

846
01:23:18,228 --> 01:23:20,868
Lies. Lies, lies
Nothings as it seems.

847
01:23:21,021 --> 01:23:24,543
So here we are? I went to see Harry Of
course I want to save him. You know.

848
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:26,877
He's my best pal.

849
01:23:27,265 --> 01:23:32,011
What if my blood works? But what if it
doesn't? I don't know. I got no idea

850
01:23:34,616 --> 01:23:36,414
I have nothing.

851
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:39,453
The only thing I keep coming back to...
Gwen Is.

852
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,624
Miss Stacy, shall I take you
upstairs?

853
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,022
Yes, I'm so sorry.

854
01:23:46,173 --> 01:23:50,700
I'm so sorry..I'm already late...
Can I have just one moment?

855
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,859
Thank-you.

856
01:23:54,997 --> 01:24:01,007
Where are we?
This is my last interview for Oxford.

857
01:24:02,732 --> 01:24:05,208
I don't know.

858
01:24:07,677 --> 01:24:11,116
I'm sorry to bother you.

859
01:24:12,002 --> 01:24:15,709
But who am I? I am John Hopkins.

860
01:24:15,534 --> 01:24:20,455
I'm one of the young professors at Harvard,
and I'm trying to get her to be in my...

861
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:24,058
Part of my team. For a while now.

862
01:24:24,128 --> 01:24:27,565
And she is the best person I know,
and a scientific genius.

863
01:24:28,245 --> 01:24:32,891
Anyway, "God save the Queen, ' I'm
sorry that I made things... Peter!!"

864
01:24:33,264 --> 01:24:37,765
Peter What do you want to say to me?
Whats the one thing?

865
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:43,872
I have to leave for a year.

866
01:24:45,886 --> 01:24:47,513
Its important to me.

867
01:24:51,673 --> 01:24:55,360
Maybe we are moving in
the opposite direction.

868
01:24:55,992 --> 01:24:57,603
I don't know.

869
01:24:57,628 --> 01:25:04,772
We were just going different ways.
I gotta go. I gotta go

870
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:07,875
Gwen.

871
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:12,518
Good luck.

872
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:37,880
'Secret Roosevelt station.
Track 61 secret underground detour...

873
01:26:38,246 --> 01:26:41,015
line D towards Pershing Square.

874
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:44,797
Here President Franklin Roosevelt
could be transported quickly...

875
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:48,299
"to keep his polio secret
for the American people."

876
01:26:57,775 --> 01:26:58,387
Mr Osborn.

877
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:04,888
You alright? Is there anything I can
get you?

878
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:08,374
No, unless you can bring
those Spiders back, to life.

879
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:12,012
Spiders?
The ones that they destroyed.

880
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:16,374
"To restore investors confidence."

881
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,660
Go home, Felicia.
Take the day off.

882
01:27:23,316 --> 01:27:23,816
Harry!

883
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:30,547
I think there may be another way,
to get what you're looking for...

884
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:37,167
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security.

885
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:43,429
Before they destroyed the spiders
they had the venom extracted.

886
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:49,444
What are you saying?

887
01:27:49,512 --> 01:27:55,408
That way they could comply with the lawsuits, and
still keep the data for when it became useful.

888
01:27:56,833 --> 01:28:00,016
Where is it?
Somewhere in the building.

889
01:28:00,886 --> 01:28:04,492
An unregistered department
called "Special Projects".

890

898
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:59,118
What did you do? A more relevant
question is what did you do?

899
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:03,197
An employee is killed, and in your
first act as CEO you cover it up.

900
01:29:03,264 --> 01:29:08,095
No, you covered it up, and then you
buried him in the madhouse using my name.

901
01:29:08,264 --> 01:29:11,877
Ravenscroft is a time institution
devoted to mental improvement.

902
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:17,364
You are experimenting on people in there.
Progress has its stepping stones.

903
01:29:17,447 --> 01:29:20,995
Now in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you'll be happy.

904
01:29:21,003 --> 01:29:24,213
How do I say this gently...
sacked.

905
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:26,134
You are not going to bury me.

906
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,431
It looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

907
01:29:30,391 --> 01:29:35,232
It's only a matter of time.
You're going to die a horrible death.

908
01:29:35,389 --> 01:29:37,470
Like your father.

909
01:29:38,028 --> 01:29:42,487
The difference is,
no one is going to miss you.

910
01:29:44,032 --> 01:29:46,492
- Get him out of here.
- Wait.

911
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,361
I know the way out.

912
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:43,303
My name is Richard Parker.

913
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:48,019
Whatever lies will be told about me,
I would like the world to know the truth.

914
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:51,468
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...</i>

915
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:56,584
When Norman Osborn made a deal with
a foreign military organization.

916
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:59,349
To continue funding my research..

917
01:32:59,318 --> 01:33:02,058
I found out what they were going to
it for.

918
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:05,990
Weapons.. Biological weapons, of course.
So I refused.

919
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,549
Now to get me out of the picture..

920
01:33:09,715 --> 01:33:13,698
Norman Osborn, has
falseified evidence against me...

921
01:33:13,864 --> 01:33:17,470
In order to take control,
of my work.

922
01:33:20,951 --> 01:33:22,461
Can I help you?

923
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:26,654
Yeh you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.

924
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:30,680
Theres a patient, that I specially
would like to see.

925
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:33,823
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn Oscorp.

926
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:36,912
Sorry, Sir, without a yellow badge,
you can't come in here.

927
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:45,646
It doesn't matter, because there is
something else that Norman doesn't know.

928
01:33:47,114 --> 01:33:51,975
The Human DNA, that I implanted in
the spiders...

929
01:33:53,529 --> 01:33:55,196
was my own.

930
01:33:57,554 --> 01:34:01,789
Which means that without me
without my bloodline...

931
01:34:01,953 --> 01:34:06,187
Oscorp can never replicate or
continue my experiments.

932
01:34:06,469 --> 01:34:08,985
With Electro integrated.

933
01:34:09,453 --> 01:34:13,648
400 milligrams of sodium
and phenobarbital.

934
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:19,159
I've destroyed as much as possible
from the archives...

935
01:34:19,169 --> 01:34:22,200
but I didn't have time
to kill all the spiders.

936
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:25,429
As a scientist, my choice is very clear
now.

937
01:34:25,638 --> 01:34:29,410
I have to disappear. I have to get
as Far away from here, as I can.

938
01:34:29,459 --> 01:34:31,470
But as a father...

939
01:34:31,496 --> 01:34:34,904
It Means, I may not see my boy
again..

940
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:41,899
Nothing is as important to me,
as my son, Peter.

941
01:34:42,114 --> 01:34:43,832
Nothing in this world.

942
01:34:44,348 --> 01:34:48,663
But I have a responsibility to protect
the world, from what I've created.

943
01:34:48,736 --> 01:34:51,754
And protect him from what
I know Osborn, is capable of.

944
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:55,172
People will say I'm a monster...

945
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:58,126
for what I've done.

946
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:01,312
Maybe they're right.

947
01:35:03,485 --> 01:35:07,091
I always thought that I'd have more time.

948
01:35:07,267 --> 01:35:10,661
DAD!!...DAD!... I'm sorry.

949
01:35:28,869 --> 01:35:31,314
Anesthesia... off

950
01:35:37,907 --> 01:35:42,433
I'm gonna get you out,
But we haven't much time.

951
01:35:42,733 --> 01:35:47,176
Who are you? - I'm Harry Osborn.
I want to make you a deal.

952
01:35:49,435 --> 01:35:52,707
- I should kill you.
- Come on.

953
01:35:53,171 --> 01:35:57,404
Think, Max.
I'm not the one you want.

954
01:35:57,569 --> 01:36:02,067
You want Spider-Man.
And I can give him to you.

955
01:36:03,135 --> 01:36:07,757
But... I need something first..

956
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:11,483
I need you to get me to Oscorp.

957
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,157
Get you Inside? You own it.

958
01:36:16,168 --> 01:36:18,685
Not anymore.
Oscorp betrayed us both.

959
01:36:18,809 --> 01:36:23,033
So I can't get in there without you, And
you can't get out of here without me.

960
01:36:23,967 --> 01:36:26,406
What's happening? Someone triggered
an alarm in the iso unit..

961
01:36:26,431 --> 01:36:29,232
Get a containment team in there now..

962
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:32,057
You can't possibly know what I want.

963
01:36:32,088 --> 01:36:35,863
You improved the design to the grid, and
they stole it, and now you want it back.

964
01:36:35,864 --> 01:36:37,578
You just wanna take what's
yours.

965
01:36:38,016 --> 01:36:43,040
All the power is in the city, Max,
and its right at your fingertips.

966
01:36:43,482 --> 01:36:45,482
Once you have completed the
electricity network...

967
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:49,447
Spider-Man will come to you, bleed
him.

968
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:53,120
Break the glass.

969
01:36:55,507 --> 01:36:57,850
Max, we don't have much time.

970
01:36:57,885 --> 01:36:58,701
Go... go... go.

971
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,399
One reason why I should I trust you?
Because I need you.

972
01:37:05,258 --> 01:37:09,186
- You need me?
- Yeah, I need you.

973
01:37:09,211 --> 01:37:13,320
You are my only chance, that
I have of surviving.

974
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,848
- You need me?
- Yes, I need you.

975
01:37:17,438 --> 01:37:20,027
I need you. Please.

976
01:37:21,637 --> 01:37:24,949
I know what its like to be thrown away..
Please!!! MAX!!

977
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,736
I need you. I need you.

978
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:24,989
You will you be my friend?

979
01:38:25,515 --> 01:38:27,693
I thought we were already?

980
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:31,464
I had a friend once.

981
01:38:31,842 --> 01:38:33,994
It didn't work out.

982
01:38:34,485 --> 01:38:36,128
Yeah, me too.

983
01:38:37,294 --> 01:38:40,236
Let us go catch a spider.

984
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:45,345
You have one new voice message.

985
01:38:47,691 --> 01:38:50,578
Hi, Peter, Its me.

986
01:38:51,591 --> 01:38:55,401
I got in to Oxford. Woo-hoo.

987
01:38:57,071 --> 01:38:59,206
Very exciting

988
01:38:58,829 --> 01:39:04,544
I came by your house, a little bit
ago And I..You weren't there. And so

989
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:07,416
I'm on my way to the airport...
Right now.

990
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,449
Because there's a summer
conferance, I had read about

991
01:39:10,474 --> 01:39:13,621
and I thought that it would
somehow.

992
01:39:13,956 --> 01:39:17,982
Be easier, I guess, this way.

993
01:39:18,608 --> 01:39:24,841
I think that maybe its time to,
let us go...

994
01:39:24,908 --> 01:39:30,822
And thats not because I don't love you,
but its actually because I do.

995
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:33,637
Goodbye..

996
01:39:47,265 --> 01:39:50,157
We have to move now.
Why... Whats happened?

997
01:40:03,047 --> 01:40:04,945
Remember me?

998
01:40:09,089 --> 01:40:12,611
Ohhh, my oh my, how the tables have
turned.

999
01:40:13,378 --> 01:40:17,929
I know it's hard to admit... But ahh
spectacular.

1000
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:22,097
Move into this..Am I right?
Right thats right.

1001
01:40:25,992 --> 01:40:28,348
So... Dear godfather..

1002
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:31,445
It's time to create me a wish.

1003
01:40:31,469 --> 01:40:36,817
I want in to special
...- How dare you come back here?

1004
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:42,024
You, unworthy, defective.

1005
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:49,487
Ohh..Sorry, that's not the answer
what we were looking for.

1006
01:41:04,283 --> 01:41:06,580
"Clear."

1007
01:41:06,815 --> 01:41:09,791
Welome back to the bonus round.

1008
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,836
Let's take a walk. Shall we...

1009
01:41:18,427 --> 01:41:22,240
The grid is all yours.

1010
01:41:53,617 --> 01:41:56,539
Spider-Man. Give it to me.

1011
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:05,305
- What is this?
- The future.

1012
01:42:19,085 --> 01:42:21,196
Rope one on..

1013
01:42:24,231 --> 01:42:28,746
It won't work.
We're in heavy diagnostic test.

1014
01:42:28,772 --> 01:42:32,927
Apart from human trials. You've
actually already run human trials...

1015
01:42:32,966 --> 01:42:36,091
you're just too stupid to know it.

1016
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:40,715
Do it. Now.

1017
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,572
You've had all this time.

1018
01:44:18,549 --> 01:44:20,121
CRITICAL INJURY DETECTED

1019
01:44:20,146 --> 01:44:21,790
HEALING PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

1020
01:44:31,465 --> 01:44:33,235
It's Spider-Man.

1021
01:44:38,886 --> 01:44:42,323
Stop the cab.
Wait I aint even moving...

1022
01:44:57,787 --> 01:45:00,178
I LOVE YOU

1023
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:17,426
Did you get my message?
What message?

1024
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:19,801
The message from above.
Wow-that was you?

1025
01:45:19,807 --> 01:45:21,994
Don't go. Let the world get off.

1026
01:45:22,063 --> 01:45:24,246
It says that 'I love you'.

1027
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,897
Because I love you.

1028
01:45:28,944 --> 01:45:31,588
No offense, but you're wrong.

1029
01:45:31,713 --> 01:45:35,693
You're my path, you're my path.

1030
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,281
You and I will always be togetherl.

1031
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:43,873
I know there are a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

1032
01:45:43,946 --> 01:45:45,885
But I'm tired.

1033
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:50,597
I'm tired of everything.

1034
01:45:51,085 --> 01:45:53,351
Of having to make a choice.

1035
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,596
And I choose you.

1036
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,607
So...

1037
01:46:00,802 --> 01:46:03,446
heres my thought.

1038
01:46:04,093 --> 01:46:05,635
England.

1039
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:08,431
Both of us.

1040
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:14,015
I'm following you now.
I'm just going to follow you everywhere..

1041
01:46:14,418 --> 01:46:16,705
I'm just going to follow you
the rest of my life..

1042
01:46:17,647 --> 01:46:20,959
They got crime there. In England..

1043
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:23,738
Apparently They have tons of crime.

1044
01:46:23,789 --> 01:46:27,865
Yeh I know... Jack the Ripper.

1045
01:46:29,191 --> 01:46:33,107
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper, he's
still in London..

1046
01:46:51,173 --> 01:46:53,485
What the hell is that?

1047
01:47:03,255 --> 01:47:05,324
Is that Max?

1048
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:08,251
He ​might just cut power to the city

1049
01:47:20,425 --> 01:47:22,857
I need tech-ops up here right now.

1050
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:26,123
Phone lines are down. Someone
go down and grab. Tech-ops...

1051
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,021
Hey... write down what you remember,
people.

1052
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:30,749
There's gotta be some sort
of a backup plan, right?

1053
01:47:31,324 --> 01:47:34,659
There is an emergency generator.

1054
01:47:34,883 --> 01:47:37,287
The transmission lines

1055
01:47:37,312 --> 01:47:39,422
they're never gonna get the backup.
How can I stop him?

1056
01:47:39,447 --> 01:47:41,723
Every time I get close, to him
he fries my webshoots.

1057
01:47:41,748 --> 01:47:44,560
Have you tried to stop him?
Yes, rubber, plastic...

1058
01:47:44,586 --> 01:47:48,357
Did you try to magnetizing him?
I didn't... Try magnetizing him.

1059
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,961
Okay well, remember eighth grade?
Final class...

1060
01:47:51,387 --> 01:47:54,200
If you magnetizes him now
with a battery...

1061
01:47:54,225 --> 01:47:56,426
You cause an electric short.
Yes...

1062
01:47:58,362 --> 01:48:02,186
Approach, this is Pan National 273
on approach..

1063
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:04,189
How do you hear?

1064
01:48:04,288 --> 01:48:07,810
Approach, do you copy
radio's working its not us..

1065
01:48:14,777 --> 01:48:19,558
There is no reason to panic.
Go back to your vehicle.

1066
01:48:19,682 --> 01:48:23,328
Go back to your car and stay calm.

1067
01:48:24,753 --> 01:48:27,478
Everyone go back to your vehicles.

1068
01:48:28,313 --> 01:48:30,410
- Agent.
- Spider-Man.

1069
01:48:30,711 --> 01:48:35,202
My father was superintendent George Stacy. Yeh
I know who he was. What can we do for you?

1070
01:48:35,203 --> 01:48:38,432
Jumper cables, Jumper cables!! Yes
and copper wire.

1071
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,995
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now - Yes.

1072
01:48:43,384 --> 01:48:46,032
You'll get over.

1073
01:48:49,325 --> 01:48:52,215
Try. Move.

1074
01:48:52,425 --> 01:48:56,449
Okay It works now. And why you
were number two in school.

1075
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,559
- I have to go.
- I'm with you.

1076
01:49:00,728 --> 01:49:03,353
You're not coming with me. Yes I know
Sorry... It's too dangerous.

1077
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:06,310
I'm with you
and I know how to reset the system.

1078
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:09,478
I'm coming with you.
You know that you need me.

1079
01:49:10,103 --> 01:49:12,409
Then go with it.
Close the bonnet.

1080
01:49:12,486 --> 01:49:14,691
Sorry, I love you.
Don't hate me.

1081
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:21,177
We still have no spare units.
Take the technicians.

1082
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:25,854
I need a respirator right now I'll
get the battery operated. Hang on!

1083
01:49:50,174 --> 01:49:52,440
Can you see me now, Spider-Man?

1084
01:49:52,774 --> 01:49:56,772
It is time to meet our
destinies.

1085
01:50:11,726 --> 01:50:17,091
We're experiencing electrical disturbance.
Instruments are going haywire radar is down.

1086
01:50:17,423 --> 01:50:20,171
We're flying blind out here
do you copy?

1087
01:50:24,297 --> 01:50:26,734
Tower We are standing by
What is happening?

1088
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:30,295
Aircraft, on intersecting path.

1089
01:50:30,296 --> 01:50:32,652
Time to impact?
Four and a half minutes.

1090
01:50:32,653 --> 01:50:34,287
Clock it... Clock it right now Now.

1091
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:51,888
You're late, Spider-Man.
I've designed this power grid.

1092
01:50:52,013 --> 01:50:55,659
Now I'm gonna take back what,
what is rightfully mine.

1093
01:50:55,994 --> 01:50:58,217
I want control of everything.

1094
01:50:58,429 --> 01:51:03,972
And I will be like a God for his.
A God named "Sparkles?"

1095
01:51:14,025 --> 01:51:17,718
Not this time. Is that all you've got?
Come on!!!

1096
01:51:37,228 --> 01:51:38,803
Come on.

1097
01:51:42,508 --> 01:51:44,486
You ready to give up?

1098
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:56,957
Ohh Thank-You, Gwen Stacy.

1099
01:52:07,342 --> 01:52:12,011
Shake it off. It's your bones,
muscles and your organs.

1100
01:52:15,473 --> 01:52:15,973
Ohh boy

1101
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:26,381
I hate this song.

1102
01:52:46,031 --> 01:52:49,532
Spider-Man, bet you never
saw this coming..

1103
01:52:55,968 --> 01:52:57,625
Are you serious?

1104
01:52:57,644 --> 01:53:00,638
You wire me to a car,
What are you a caveman.

1105
01:53:00,967 --> 01:53:04,238
You tie me up, to go off to war
I outa help you.

1106
01:53:04,735 --> 01:53:08,465
I know the grid down.
I can reset the system.

1107
01:53:08,798 --> 01:53:12,780
You can't be here right now I'm not messing
around. You can't be here right now.

1108
01:53:12,901 --> 01:53:15,962
Nobody makes my decisions.
For me, alright... Nobody..

1109
01:53:16,012 --> 01:53:17,978
This is my choice okay...

1110
01:53:18,735 --> 01:53:21,125
My choice, mine...

1111
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,497
Now how do we stop him?

1112
01:53:23,766 --> 01:53:27,288
He is like a battery. So What happens
when you overcharge a battery?

1113
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:31,019
It explodes... Right..So We
use his power against him. Perfect.

1114
01:53:31,044 --> 01:53:34,834
Okay I need to re-connect power,
I need you to reset the system.

1115
01:53:34,835 --> 01:53:40,170
Okay when I say you turn that power on, you turn
it on. No matter what. Peter, no matter what.

1116
01:53:44,691 --> 01:53:46,393
Go!! Go!

1117
01:54:37,948 --> 01:54:40,001
60 seconds to impact.

1118
01:55:14,805 --> 01:55:17,556
Now, Gwen. Do it nowwww.

1119
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:39,179
OVERLOAD

1120
01:55:43,131 --> 01:55:44,809
Unit 687.

1121
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:58,309
This is La guardia tower.turn
immediately, heading 280.

1122
01:55:59,009 --> 01:56:02,993
Incoming traffic, I repeat 280.

1123
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,546
Get back to work, lets
land these planes.

1124
01:56:22,711 --> 01:56:24,345
I'll be back.

1125
01:56:24,558 --> 01:56:29,695
We're back in the air. Back
to work everybody lets go.

1126
01:57:05,188 --> 01:57:07,379
Hello are you still making a fight.

1127
01:57:15,903 --> 01:57:18,006
Gwen, stay there.

1128
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:44,119
Peter.

1129
01:57:45,613 --> 01:57:48,800
When you said: Spider-Man, said no

1130
01:57:49,233 --> 01:57:53,303
you meant "you" said "no"

1131
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:56,227
Harry, what did you just do?

1132
01:57:56,315 --> 01:57:58,371
What you made me do.

1133
01:57:58,511 --> 01:58:03,045
You were my friend and you betrayed me.

1134
01:58:03,225 --> 01:58:06,786
No, I was trying to protect you.

1135
01:58:07,413 --> 01:58:11,059
Look at me. Harry. Its gonna be Okay.
Its gonna be alright..

1136
01:58:11,122 --> 01:58:14,974
You give people no hope.
You take it away.

1137
01:58:15,135 --> 01:58:18,821
No, Harry. And now I'm going
to take away yours...

1138
01:58:18,915 --> 01:58:20,574
Gwen... Run...

1139
01:58:22,709 --> 01:58:24,492
Harry, put her down.

1140
01:58:40,664 --> 01:58:42,250
Harry, Stop this right now.

1141
01:58:42,275 --> 01:58:45,505
Harry put her down, this is
not you, Harry Put her down.

1142
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,452
Harry's dead.

1143
01:58:48,476 --> 01:58:51,536
Harry This is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1144
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:53,738
Fight me, let her go.

1145
01:59:05,516 --> 01:59:07,585
You're okay?

1146
01:59:12,054 --> 01:59:14,798
I got you. I put you down now.

1147
02:02:03,553 --> 02:02:05,062
Breathe..

1148
02:02:17,452 --> 02:02:19,464
You'll be fine.

1149
02:02:29,278 --> 02:02:33,910
Stay with me. Stay with me

1150
02:02:43,099 --> 02:02:43,599
Gwen

1151
02:02:46,695 --> 02:02:49,294
Gwen... please.

1152
02:02:51,713 --> 02:02:53,620
Please.

1153
02:03:00,108 --> 02:03:02,334
I can't do without you.

1154
02:05:05,103 --> 02:05:07,232
Leave us.

1155
02:05:10,917 --> 02:05:12,889
Have you made progress?

1156
02:05:12,914 --> 02:05:16,266
I've examined some worthy
candidates.

1157
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,517
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1158
02:05:18,686 --> 02:05:21,870
this city will never be the same.

1159
02:05:22,324 --> 02:05:24,840
Ohh..I'm counting on that.

1160
02:05:25,004 --> 02:05:27,943
Speaking of progress,
you're looking better.

1161
02:05:28,905 --> 02:05:30,752
It comes and goes.

1162
02:05:32,427 --> 02:05:34,021
Tell me more.

1163
02:05:34,364 --> 02:05:38,224
How many men did you have in mind?
I want to keep it small.

1164
02:05:38,389 --> 02:05:41,830
Everything you need is already at Oscorp.

1165
02:05:43,665 --> 02:05:47,689
<i>Access granted.
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1166
02:05:47,727 --> 02:05:51,799
<i>Who is the first volunteer?
Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1167
02:05:51,823 --> 02:05:54,085
<i>Apparently serving a
life sentence.</i>

1168
02:05:54,257 --> 02:05:57,987
<i>He was eager to join us.</i>

1169
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,232
<i>Good.</i>

1170
02:06:00,673 --> 02:06:02,685
<i>Start with him.</i>

1171
02:06:02,735 --> 02:06:08,321
<i>Russian Aleksei Sytsevich was broken. Out of a
classified penetentiary known simply as 'The Vault'..</i>

1172
02:06:08,564 --> 02:06:10,159
By an unknown team of men.

1173
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:13,259
Its yet Another example of
increased criminal activity.

1174
02:06:13,284 --> 02:06:16,595
Since the disappearance of Spider-Man
5 months months ago..

1175
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:19,940
The webslingers absence has
left a hole in the heart of our city.

1176
02:06:20,065 --> 02:06:24,424
Believe it or not even the New York city Police
Department has joined the chorus of New Yorkers...

1177
02:06:24,649 --> 02:06:27,100
In hoping for the return of webslinger...

1178
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:30,064
The entire world seems to be asking
the same question:

1179
02:06:30,168 --> 02:06:32,266
Where is Spider-Man.

1180
02:06:33,226 --> 02:06:35,701
Its wrong that spider-guy.

1181
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:40,911
Since he's disappeared seems like,
everybody really needs him.

1182
02:06:42,556 --> 02:06:44,219
Where you going?

1183
02:06:45,032 --> 02:06:47,713
- I'm not sure.
- Peter...

1184
02:06:48,175 --> 02:06:50,148
Where are you going?

1185
02:06:59,346 --> 02:07:00,921
I don't know.

1186
02:07:02,744 --> 02:07:04,462
It's not funny...

1187
02:07:05,347 --> 02:07:08,196
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organised...

1188
02:07:08,263 --> 02:07:13,085
Clean some of Bens stuff.
In boxes..

1189
02:07:13,518 --> 02:07:17,289
Funny the heavier the box gets,
the lighter I feel.

1190
02:07:17,902 --> 02:07:20,524
You throwing his stuff away?

1191
02:07:21,807 --> 02:07:24,951
I couldn't. Do that
It's a part of me.

1192
02:07:25,809 --> 02:07:28,743
It's just... Finding...

1193
02:07:29,885 --> 02:07:31,395
a better place for them.

1194
02:07:35,129 --> 02:07:37,614
I'm gonna take one last look...

1195
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:40,705
and put them away where they belong.

1196
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,717
Gwen's speech.

1197
02:08:05,388 --> 02:08:09,582
It is easy feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1198
02:08:10,498 --> 02:08:13,393
But there will be Dark days ahead of us
to.

1199
02:08:14,574 --> 02:08:17,431
And there will be days when you
feel all alone.

1200
02:08:19,645 --> 02:08:22,120
Thats when hope is needed
most...

1201
02:08:23,585 --> 02:08:25,642
no matter how heavy it gets..

1202
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,545
Or how lost you feel, you must promise me..

1203
02:08:30,753 --> 02:08:34,110
That you will hope on.

1204
02:08:35,615 --> 02:08:37,386
Keep it alive.

1205
02:08:37,747 --> 02:08:40,736
We have to be greater
than what we suffer..

1206
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:44,760
I wish for you that you become
hope.

1207
02:08:45,019 --> 02:08:47,031
People need that.

1208
02:08:47,637 --> 02:08:52,288
And even if we fail, what better way
is there to live..

1209
02:08:53,425 --> 02:08:55,438
As we look around here today.

1210
02:08:55,603 --> 02:08:58,831
And all of the people who help to
make us who we are..

1211
02:08:59,503 --> 02:09:02,418
I know it feels like we're
saying 'goodbye'

1212
02:09:02,938 --> 02:09:08,704
But we carry a piece of each other into
everything that we do next..

1213
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:12,918
To remind us, of who we are...

1214
02:09:14,765 --> 02:09:16,569
and if we were meant to be..

1215
02:09:18,915 --> 02:09:23,359
I had a great 4 years with
you, I'll miss you all very much.

1216
02:09:45,506 --> 02:09:47,424
Move out of the way.

1217
02:10:00,474 --> 02:10:04,876
I'm here live on Park Avenue and 56th
Street where there is complete chaos...

1218
02:10:05,386 --> 02:10:09,286
<i>A man in some sort of weaponised
armoured suit, is wreaking havoc on</i>

1219
02:10:13,152 --> 02:10:18,477
I'm Rhino.
I told you I would be back.

1220
02:10:36,626 --> 02:10:40,578
Hold your fire.
Everybody hold your fire.

1221
02:10:47,429 --> 02:10:49,825
Boy, you have to...

1222
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:52,941
Look, New York.

1223
02:10:53,037 --> 02:10:55,405
Spider-Man is back.

1224
02:10:56,581 --> 02:10:58,593
That's my son.

1225
02:11:01,638 --> 02:11:03,775
Brave boy. Huh.

1226
02:11:03,901 --> 02:11:06,207
Does Aleksei Makes scare you, little
boy?

1227
02:11:23,736 --> 02:11:25,514
Hey, Spider-Man.

1228
02:11:35,505 --> 02:11:39,700
I knew you'd come back. Thanks
for stepping up for me.

1229
02:11:39,717 --> 02:11:42,339
You are the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1230
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:45,195
I'm gonna take care of him, so you
can take care of your mom... Okay...

1231
02:11:45,274 --> 02:11:47,791
Alright get out of here your gone.

1232
02:11:54,879 --> 02:11:58,469
Do you want to fight with.
You will fight me now?

1233
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:02,972
On Behalf of the fine people of New
York city and real rhinos everywhere...

1234
02:12:02,997 --> 02:12:06,280
I ask you to turn your mechanised
palms in the air.

1235
02:12:06,305 --> 02:12:10,624
Never. I crush you and
kill you and destroy.

1236
02:12:10,793 --> 02:12:13,602
You're gonna have to come down here
so you can kill me? Yes...

1237
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:16,900
I'll be right there..There's
No place like home.

1238
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:18,100
