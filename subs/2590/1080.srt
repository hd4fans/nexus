Aspen prison shuttle docked.

2
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,846
Parolees prepare to disembark.

3
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,438
Ferguson, Herman.

4
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,864
Six months sentence, Aspen Prison served. Welcome back, citizen.

5
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,243
Your living assignment is... "Y" block, Heavenly Haven.

6
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,496
Red quad. Move on. Come on.

7
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,901
Welcome home.

8
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,388
That's it ! l think that's Heavenly Haven.

9
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,767
- ln your dreams, buddy. - Yeah, Heavenly..

10
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,187
Starting descent to Sector 12, Yellow District.

11
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,189
900 feet.

12
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,941
700 feet.

13
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,652
400 feet.

14
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:22,322
Take caution in this sector. There is a citizen riot in progress.

15
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,408
Have a nice day.

16
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,275
lt's better than prison.

17
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,195
Jesus Christ !

18
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,782
Eat recycled food for a happier, healthier life.

19
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,702
Be kind and peaceful to each other.

20
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,121
Eat recycled food.

21
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:16,001
Recycled food. lt's good for the environment and okay for you.

22
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,343
Hey... look what l got !

23
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,222
Little cupcake.

24
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,684
What have we got here ? Are you a Judge spy, little man ?

25
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,772
Me... a spy ? This guy is funny.

26
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,149
No, no, no. l, l live here.

27
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,946
l mean, l'm gonna live here, if l live. Maybe l should go to a hotel ?

28
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,990
No way, man ! Don't you hear 'em out there ?

29
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,159
lt's block war, man !

30
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,041
- Block war. - Yeah.

31
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,445
Just like an Academy simulation right down to the cross fire.

32
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,365
- l'll lead off. You follow. - This is no sim, rookie !

33
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,868
We'll stand down and wait for backup.

34
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,455
Hershey and Brisco in position outside Heavenly Haven !

35
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,584
We're under fire from the upper floors. Request backup.

36
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,295
Cell "B" in Heavenly Haven, on the corner of Abbott and Costello.

37
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,423
Request backup.

38
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,588
Holy crud ! He's a sitting duck out there.

39
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,256
He knows what he's doing.

40
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,013
l am... the Law !

41
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,478
Drop... your weapons !

42
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:44,066
These blocks... are under... arrest !

43
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,613
This is your final warning !

44
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,990
That's Judge Dredd, man !

45
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,953
Hey ! You wanna be afraid of somebody ? Be afraid of me !

46
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,706
l got it ! Why don't l run down there and surrender ?

47
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,877
Sort of throw 'em off guard ! Bad idea.

48
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,214
Hey, Dredd ! Come and get us !

49
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,472
- l knew they'd do that. - Judge Dredd, take cover !

50
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:20,978
They're firing .20 millimeter caseless flechette rounds at 300 meters.

51
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,731
The effective lethal range is 200 meters.

52
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,319
You're safe. What are you doing down there, Judge Hershey ?

53
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,364
Waiting for backup.

54
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,035
lt's here.

55
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,289
Let's move it out. Keep it simple. Single file.

56
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:44,251
Standard relay. l'm point. You're last.

57
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,299
- Grenade. - Grenade.

58
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,804
- Nice shot, sir ! - You two meet me on the 40th.

59
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,098
Hey, you need to get some more ammo !

60
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,895
Be kind and peaceful to each other. Eat recycled food.

61
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,397
Hey, you guys with us ?

62
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,568
Yeah ! All right ! Let's rock 'n' roll !

63
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,080
Dredd !

64
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,462
This room has been pacified.

65
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,299
- Next one's mine ! - No ! Rookie, hold on !

66
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,510
This room is under arrest !

67
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,803
No !

68
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,889
Die, Judges ! Die !

69
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,396
You're under arrest. Throw down your weapons, and prepare to be judged !

70
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,899
Judge this, Lawgiver man !

71
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,319
- No, don't ! They're booby-trapped. - lntruder.

72
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,073
- Holy drok !

73
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,201
Full auto. Rapid-fire.

74
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,203
Rapid-fire.

75
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,254
- Armor piercing. - Armor piercing.

76
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,507
Drop dead, Dredd !

77
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,929
- Double whammy. - Double whammy.

78
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,688
Mega City municipal code 213:

79
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,816

81
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,198
Code 457: Resisting arrest, 20 years !

82
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,369
Thank you, Hershey.

83
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,708
And code 3613:

84
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,087
The first degree murder of a Street Judge.

85
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,882
Let me guess. Life.

86
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,054
Death.

87
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,851
Court's adjourned.

88
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,605
Violence struck again in Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.

89
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,775
Fifty-three hospitalized, five of them children. Nineteen dead.

90
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,153
You got him ?

91
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,281
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn.. The other way. You got him ?

92
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,743
Damn it !

93
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,703
l was supposed to be watching out for him.

94
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,956
Don't blame yourself, Hershey. He made the mistake, not you.

95
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,045
Wouldn't it feel good to have an emotion once in a while, huh ?

96
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,424
Emotions. There oughta be a law against them.

97
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,178
- Eat recycled food. - Halt !

98
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,306
lt's good for the environment, and okay for you.

99
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,643
Please make your selection. lnsert your credit in the slot.

100
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,313
- You have five seconds to surrender ! - Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.

101
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,441
- The servo-droid is your friend. Please let your friend go by. - Five. Four.

102
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,195
- Three. Two. - You are in the way of the servo-droid.

103
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,991
- One ! - Boy, am l glad to see you !

104
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,077
Mega City code 7592:

105
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,788
Willful sabotage of a public droid. That's six months, citizen.

106
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,374
Let's see your Unicard.

107
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:14,253
Come on, give me a break, Judge... Dredd. Dredd ?

108
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,881
- God ! - Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.

109
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,426
lllegal tampering with city droids, computers, cash machines, taxi robots..

110
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,263
And you haven't even been out of jail for 24 hours. He's habitual, Hershey.

111
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,849
Automatic five-year sentence. How do you plead ?

112
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,519
- Not guilty ? - l knew you'd say that.

113
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,481
Five years ? No ! No ! l... l had no choice.

114
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,067
- They were killing each other. - You could've gone out the window.

115
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:42,281
- 40 floors ? lt would've been suicide. - Maybe... but it's legal.

116
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,074
- Judges ? - Yes, sir ? - What ?

117
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,077
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away.

118
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:51,039
Don't close the case. You're misjudging me ! Open the case !

119
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,168
You're not going to be able to sleep tonight.

120
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,253
He might've been telling the truth, you know.

121
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,672
Haven't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances ?

122
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,466
l've heard it all, Hershey.

123
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,928
l knew you'd say that.

124
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,767
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten the lessons of history ?

125
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,396
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten the lessons of history ?

126
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,733
However quickly these block wars can be contained,

127
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,861
it's clear that they're becoming an epidemic;

128
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,032
an epidemic that should be dealt with... immediately.

129
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,702
The only solution is a tougher criminal code.

130
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,622
Our situation gets worse every day.

131
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:36,001
73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors in the last two months alone.

132
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,047
Violent crime is rising at 15?o every quarter.

133
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,341
lf we don't increase our resources,

134
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,177
they will be inadequate in less than three years.

135
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,763
Three years ? Our resources are inadequate now !

136
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,848
My fellow Council members,

137
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,310
as a city we continue to grow,

138
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,604
and growth is painful.

139
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:01,527
Sixty-five million people living in an area designed for no more than 20 !

140
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,612
lt's not enough that they rely on us...

141
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,448
for food, clothes, water, clean air..

142
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,993
Chief Justice, the city is in chaos !

143
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,205
For social order, we need tighter reins.

144
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,624
lncarceration hasn't worked as a deterrent.

145
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,878
l say we expand execution to include lesser crimes !

146
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,757
My fellow Judges,

147
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:28,136
l was barely in my teens when l put on this badge.

148
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,639
When the time comes for me to take it off,

149
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:35,644
please let me do so knowing that it still stands for freedom...

150
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,273
and not for repression.

151
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,109
- 53 hospitalized.

152
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,737
Nineteen dead, four of them killed by a gang of squatters...

153
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,199
who were themselves killed in summary executions by Judge Dredd.

154
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,036
As my special undercover report continues,

155
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,164
l will take you behind the scenes at the Halls of Justice...

156
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,878
for a disturbing probe into these recent riots and block wars.

157
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:04,006
Coincidence... or deliberate ?

158
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:04,715
Dredd !

159
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,300
Dredd !

160
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:10,888
Some people think working these mean streets has a dehumanizing effect on..

161
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,066
- Joseph. - Chief Justice Fargo.

162
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,403
You may stand at ease, Joseph.

163
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:41,001
So, tell me. Seven summary executions. Were they necessary ?

164
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,003
Unavoidable, sir.

165
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,963
Unavoidable.

166
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,674
Life doesn't mean much to some people anymore.

167
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,679
- You'd see that if you weren't always.. - lf l weren't what ?

168
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,348
Always at the Academy, sir.

169
00:16:54,348 --> 00:17:01,230
Oh ! Don't you mean, at the Academy wiping cadets' asses ?

170
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,732
That's what they say in the squad room, isn't it ?

171
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,777
lt's irrelevant. You set the standard, sir.

172
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,822
Now you do... at least to many young cadets.

173
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,033
You're a legend.

174
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,202
Sir.

175
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,038
You remember your days as a cadet, Joseph ?

176
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,123
l remember what you taught me, sir.

177
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,961
You were my finest student.

178
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,214
So, l've drawn a new assignment for you.

179
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:31,677
Starting tomorrow, you're going to spend two days a week at the Academy.

180
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,388
l'd be honored, sir. narmed combat or marksmanship ?

181
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,473
Ethics.

182
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,963
Wait here.

183
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,513
Remain still. ldentify yourself.

184
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,932
Miller. Warden.

185
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,477
Voice sample recognized. Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.

186
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:27,774
Why are you here ? Did you come for another chat ?

187
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,111
Just a short one, l'm afraid. Duty calls.

188
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,197
Ah, duty !

189
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:38,619
Feeding these parasites here at the public's expense ?

190
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:42,789
Yeah. You especially !

191
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,752
l don't cost anything.

192
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,837
l'm a ghost.

193
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,508
And we're both prisoners here.

194
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,887
You're behind your desk... and l'm behind this.

195
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,392
What a clever reward from Fargo, huh ?

196
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,186
l mean, considering the services.

197
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,982
When you started killing innocent people, Rico,

198
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,360
you went beyond service.

199
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,531
The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators...

200
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,741
like you.

201
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,621
Guilt and innocence...

202
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,706
is a matter of timing.

203
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,543
Your..

204
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,171
Our mysterious benefactor...

205
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,882
has sent you a package.

206
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,181
Deactivate shield. Autoguns only.

207
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,726
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.

208
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,733
Hmm.

209
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:56,405
- What is that ? - lt's an ancient puzzle...

210
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,867
that contains the meaning of life.

211
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,457
So, tell me, Rico,

212
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,377
what is the meaning of life ?

213
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,924
lt ends.

214
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,138
Stop ! Computer!

215
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:25,517
Activate alarm !

216
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,271
Voice not recognized. Guns are training.

217
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,065
Remain still.

218
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,573
Security, override and unlock ! Come on !

219
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:03,889
Kevlar 9 helmet and body armor. Yours... when you graduate.

220
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,477
Lawgiver Two.

221
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,273
25-round side arm with mission-variable voice-programmed ammunition.

222
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,984
- Signal flare. - Flare.

223
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:22,032
Yours... if you graduate.

224
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,160
Mark 4 Lawmaster, improved model,

225
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,120
with dual on-board laser cannons,

226
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,414
vertical take-off and landing flight capability.

227
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,543
Range: 500 kilometers.

228
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:36,213
- Men. - Yes, sir.

229
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,842
Active. Malfunction. Malfunction.

230
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,135
Malfunction.

231
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,180
Hmm ?

232
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,185
Yours if you can ever get it to work.

233
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,733
All of these things you see here are toys.

234
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,821
At the end of the day when you're all alone in the dark,

235
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:06,535
the only thing that counts... is this: the Law.

236
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,708
And you will be alone when you swear to uphold these ideals.

237
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,296
For most of us, there's only death in the streets.

238
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,882
For the few of us that survive to old age,

239
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,178
the proud loneliness of the Long Walk.

240
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,181
A walk that every Judge must take...

241
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,808
outside these city walls...

242
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:32,394
into the unknown of the Cursed Earth.

243
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,273
And there spend your last remaining days...

244
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:40,652
taking law to the lawless.

245
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,907
This is what it means to be a Judge.

246
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:50,245
This is the commitment l expect.

247
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:54,208
Class dismissed.

248
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,376
Attention all personnel.

249
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,004
Due to the recent disturbance in Heavenly Haven,

250
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:03,050
there will be increased patrols in Sector 4.

251
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:06,595
Please check with your commanders to see if you are affected...

252
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,805
by these scheduled changes.

253
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,477
l can hear you thinking.

254
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,479
l caught your lecture today.

255
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,065
ls that really what you think the cadets need to hear ?

256
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,027
- What l told them is the truth. - Your truth maybe.

257
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,530
You made it sound like our lives are practically over.

258
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,449
Don't you think... parts are, Hershey ?

259
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,160
l have a personal life. l have friends.

260
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,162
You're one of the smartest of the new breed,

261
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,122
but you've only been on the street a year.

262
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:38,293
You haven't gotten used to the isolation yet.

263
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:43,298
No. No, l don't think that's right.

264
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,218
No one is supposed to be alone all the time.

265
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:50,597
l mean, is that really what it's been like for you ?

266
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,560
don't you ever.. haven't you ever had a friend ?

267
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,730
Yes. Once.

268
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,732
What happened ?

269
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:07,072
Dredd, wait.

270
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,157
l want to know. What happened ?

271
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,036
l judged him.

272
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,215
Aspen shuttle has completed off-loading.

273
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:30,637
- Cargo and morgue shipments from Aspen. - Okay.

274
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,974
Let's get outta here.

275
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,134
Get your nose filters ! Get your nose filters !

276
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,556
Please select your fantasy now and enjoy.

277
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,267
...who were themselves killed...

278
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,479
in summary executions by Judge Dredd.

279
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,564
As my special undercover report continues,

280
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:26,235
l will take you behind the scenes at the Halls of Justice.

281
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,003
We're closed for the night.

282
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,343
You're holding a package for me. The code name is Lazarus.

283
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:54,054
l'll just be a second.

284
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,353
You got a nice place.

285
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,524
Yeah. A lot of this is antiques.

286
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:10,320
l thought they destroyed all these A.B.C. warriors during the last war.

287
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,406
Well, you can still collect 'em...

288
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,534
as long as they're nonfunctioning... like my wife.

289
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,496
- These must be 50 or 60 years old now.

290
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,290
Anyway...

291
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,043
there you go.

292
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,597
- Hey, wait a second ! Don't touch it. - Why is that ?

293
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:41,518
lt's a Lawgiver. That's programmed to only recognize a Judge's hand.

294
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,855
You touch that, it'll take your arm off.

295
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,986
Gee... how do you like that ? l must be a Judge.

296
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,855
Happy birthday.

297
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,161
Status ?

298
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,918
Bodyguard.

299
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:51,588
- Commander ? - Rico.

300
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:56,677
- Mission ? - Mission ? We're going to war.

301
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,013
War.

302
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,564
l followed up some grumblings confirming a suspicion of mine.

303
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,317
The cancer of oppression goes far deeper than the Street Judges.

304
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,820
- You're going to say that over the air? - lt's the truth!

305
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,282
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane. - l'm a reporter.

306
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,784
They're never going to let this get onto the air.

307
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,579
Something like this could bring down the Council.

308
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,584
maybe it should. the whole system is the problem, not just judge..

309
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,837
Dredd. No !

310
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,477
Judge Hershey, corner of burns and allen. level "d."

311
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,814
Possible D..l. May need assistance.

312
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:56,528
Here we go !

313
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,073
- Step out of the car, please. - What the hell's the problem now ?

314
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:03,619
Get out of the car ! nicard, please.

315
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,207
Did you hear me ? nicard !

316
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:15,714
Mr. Souza. You have a suspended license.

317
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,759
- You've got three counts of driving under the influence. - Hey, you better listen.

318
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:22,179
l suggest you walk away and bother somebody else.

319
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,098
When l said l have powerful friends, l mean powerful !

320
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:29,269
- Are we having a problem, Hershey? - Not at all. Nothing l can't handle.

321
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,480
Suspended license. Three D..l.'s.

322
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,859
This is getting boring. Okay, so what's the tab ? C'mon.

323
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,779
How much is this going to cost me ? You name your price.

324
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,782
Hershey, call Control for an H-wagon.

325
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,118
What ? l don't believe it. You're going to tow me ?

326
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,372
Towing is for a first offense. This is your fourth violation, bar breath.

327
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,083
- You're a menace. How do you plead ? - Not guilty.

328
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,877
l knew you'd say that.

329
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,088
- Wait a second. What are you doing ? - Grenade.

330
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,257
- Grenade. - No !

331
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,764
Happy motoring.

332
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,769
- Subtle. - Mm-hmm.

333
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,605
Judge Joseph Dredd.

334
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,819
Dredd, you're under arrest.

335
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,988
What's the charge ?

336
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,781
Murder.

337
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:33,083
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo now entering maximum security area.

338
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,136
- Joseph. - Sir.

339
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,726
- ls it true ? - l'm innocent.

340
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,146
The Council is said to have irrefutable proof.

341
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,440
Do you believe that ?

342
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,276
There is to be a full tribunal.

343
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,905
- A conviction means death. - Do you believe that, sir ?

344
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:13,332
l just needed to look into your eyes for myself.

345
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:16,668
l'm sorry l asked.

346
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:20,631
l would never do anything to disgrace you with the Council, sir.

347
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:25,636
l'll use every resource to find out, Joseph.

348
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:28,764
Have you selected someone to defend you ?

349
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:32,518
- Judge Hershey. - Hershey ? Why a Street Judge ?

350
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:36,813
At the Academy, she was at the top of her class in interpretational law.

351
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,816
And l trust her.

352
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,027
The facts will come out at the tribunal.

353
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,030
l'll personally make sure of that.

354
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,700
Sir ?

355
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:52,746
l'm sorry about this.

356
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,630
- Dredd ! No !

357
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,633
Play back.

358
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,344
- Dredd ! No !

359
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:12,683
- Dredd ! No !

360
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,145
Play back.

361
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:21,024
Stop video. The video you have just seen...

362
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:25,612
is prima facie evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged.

363
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,990
mark it people's exhibit "a."

364
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,992
Objection, Your Honor.

365
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:33,120
This video is inadmissible as evidence.

366
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,874
- lf l may be given a moment to explain? - Please do.

367
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:42,379
l have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer, currently a junior at the Academy.

368
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,882
Cadet Olmeyer has been acknowledged...

369
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:48,844
by every one of his instructors to be an expert in digital and video graphics.

370
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:55,434
His affidavit states this surveillance video is of such low definition,

371
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:59,062
no positive identification can be made of the killer.

372
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,731
Your Honors,

373
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,567
we know that the uniform of a Judge can be counterfeit...

374
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,527
and that the badge can be duplicated,

375
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,655
and since neither the video nor the audio in this presentation...

376
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:11,700
can identify the accused in any way,

377
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:15,746
l repeat my objection to this video being allowed as evidence in this case,

378
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:18,040
and l ask for a ruling.

379
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:31,303
Objection sustained.

380
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,223
The video is inadmissible.

381
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,891
Yes !

382
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,685
Shh.

383
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,562
Admit it, Dredd.

384
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:44,024
- What ? - You're impressed.

385
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,984
- Very. - You owe me.

386
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,278
- Hmm. - Very well.

387
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,280
l'm therefore forced to move...

388
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,783
to technical information of a critical nature.

389
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,369
l will need the court's permission...

390
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:59,456
to access top-secret documentation...

391
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,542
with the help of Central Computer Bank.

392
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,210
You may proceed.

393
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,587
Central, are you on-line ?

394
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,673
On-line, Judge McGruder.

395
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,592
l wish you to access weapons schematic.

396
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:14,972
Describe the working of the standard Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver Two.

397
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:18,433
Model Two is coded to the personal D.N.A....

398
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,519
of the Judge using the weapon...

399
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,856
via the skin's contact with the grip, a fail-safe security..

400
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,233
- Did you know about this ? - No !

401
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,861
The D.N.A. is obtained from my medical files,

402
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:32,906
and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded.

403
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,409
Each time a round is chambered and fired...

404
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,745
the projectile is tagged with the relevant D.N.A.

405
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:42,416
Chief Justice, the defense was not made aware of any of this information.

406
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:46,670
Judge Hershey, the prosecution must be given time to finish.

407
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:55,971
Central, were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond...

408
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,140
so D.N.A. coded ?

409
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:02,728
Yes, Judge McGruder. lt could not be otherwise.

410
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:06,690
And what was the result of the computer check...

411
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,526
of the D.N.A. coding on those bullets ?

412
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,071
The D.N.A. is a perfect match for Judge Joseph Dredd.

413
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:16,408
lt's a lie ! The evidence has been falsified.

414
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:21,079
lt's impossible ! l never broke the Law ! l am the Law !

415
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,750
- We have no case. - You gotta believe me !

416
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,753
You have to believe me. Say it.

417
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:32,341
Your Honor... the prosecution rests.

418
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,433
The Tribunal needs to confer !

419
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,944
What have l done ? How could l have been so wrong?

420
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:56,740
Dredd ! Both of them homicidal.

421
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:00,077
Only this time it will be impossible to cover up.

422
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,788
Chief Justice,

423
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:06,959
we carefully buried the Janus project nine years ago...

424
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,504
along with Rico and all his victims.

425
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,340
No one will ever learn of your involvement.

426
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,051
The media knows how close l am to Dredd.

427
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,680
They'll dig until the whole truth comes out.

428
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:23,350
lt's the perfect excuse to ruin what government we have left.

429
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,519
Your motives were pure.

430
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,813
You thought Dredd was different. That's why you spared him.

431
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,732
A mistake which may bring down the judicial system.

432
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,702
There is a way out, Chief Justice.

433
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:45,539
lf you will forgive me. The Long Walk.

434
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:53,881
That's a death sentence, Judge Griffin. Mine.

435
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:58,177
Your retirement grants you the power to save Dredd's life !

436
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,682
This gesture...

437
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:07,436
may also allow Janus to remain a secret.

438
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,654
ln the charge of premeditated murder,

439
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:22,659
this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd...

440
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,162
guilty as charged.

441
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,333
Joseph Dredd,

442
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:34,546
you're aware the law allows only one punishment for your crime.

443
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,840
Death.

444
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,719
However, it has long been our custom...

445
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:46,433
to carry out the last order of a retiring Senior Judge.

446
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,978
And so...

447
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,985
l step down.

448
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,946
No !

449
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,284
As l leave...

450
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,704
to take my Long Walk into the Cursed Earth,

451
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:12,835
l ask that this court honor my last order.

452
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,880
Be lenient with Judge Dredd...

453
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,508
in gratitude for his years of service.

454
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:23,470
We will so honor this one, Judge Fargo.

455
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,061
Dredd, step forward.

456
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:37,442
The sentence shall be life imprisonment...

457
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,988
at Aspen Penal Colony, to be carried out immediately...

458
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:43,156
as it is written !

459
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:47,327
Justice Griffin, this trial has been a farce ! l demand an appeal !

460
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:51,623
You will accept the court's decision, Judge Hershey !

461
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,139
Dredd, l'm so sorry.

462
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,433
l let you down.

463
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:14,646
You did your best, Hershey. Thank you.

464
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:18,317
Let the betrayer of the Law...

465
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,653
be taken from our courts.

466
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,448
Let his armor be taken from him,

467
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:27,701
and all his garb of justice.

468
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:33,624
Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memory... forever.

469
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:47,179
Let his name be recorded in every place of honor.

470
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:53,769
Let him take the Law he served so well...

471
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,772
to those who have it not.

472
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,819
Let him be written...

473
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:08,367
in our hearts and our memories... forever.

474
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,459
Attention all judges. you are reminded..

475
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:02,462
Judge Hershey.

476
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,563
lt's gotta be here some..

477
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,739
What's this ?

478
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,869
Baby Dredd ?

479
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,371
l can't believe you were ever a baby.

480
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,503
Who's this ?

481
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,357
Chief Justice Griffin.

482
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,572
lt's got a nice ring to it.

483
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:13,784
We were supposed to meet someplace safe !

484
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:27,130
What's not safe ? Your reporter's dead, right?

485
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,216
Fargo's on his Walk.

486
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,927
Dredd's in Aspen.

487
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,763
So, what's not safe ?

488
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:38,308
lt's unfortunate.

489
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:42,896
Hammond had to be silenced. He found out about Janus.

490
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,733
- But l could've used Dredd. - Forget Dredd !

491
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,027
There is no Dredd !

492
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:52,072
Let me tell you what Dredd worships.

493
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:54,157
He worships the Law !

494
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:58,328
He'd have blown you away the minute he found out how much you're pissin' on it.

495
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:05,711
Yeah. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen.

496
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,921
Let him see what it's like to be me !

497
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,301
There's a lot of work to be done.

498
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:16,471
Janus. Well, where is it ?

499
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:18,557
- You'll see it ! - When ?

500
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,685
Soon enough !

501
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,196
ln the meantime, l want chaos, Rico.

502
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,698
That block war was just the beginning.

503
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,994
Now l want fear racing through every street !

504
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:42,539
And the Council will have to turn to me.

505
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,125
And to Janus !

506
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,296
You want fear ? l'm fear.

507
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,633
You want chaos ? l'm the chaos.

508
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:56,595
You want a new beginning ? Here ! l am the new beginning !

509
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,273
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.

510
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:12,861
Due to storm cloud activity over the desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.

511
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:16,406
Flight time approximately four hours.

512
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:38,095
Dredd ? Don't hit me. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

513
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,139
What are you doing here ?

514
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:45,811
l was convicted of a crime. Wrongly convicted.

515
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,775
Really ? That's kinda weird.

516
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,735
What are the odds ?

517
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:57,906
Two wrongly-convicted guys sittin' right next to each other.

518
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:00,534
You received the sentence the Law required.

519
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:05,747
Five years... just for saving my own ass ?

520
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,833
That was a mistake !

521
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:11,253
The Law doesn't make mistakes.

522
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:15,424
Really ? Then how do you explain what happened to you ?

523
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:22,431
You can't... can you ?

524
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:27,102
great ! mr. "l am the law" can't.

525
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:31,064
So, maybe, this is some kind of typo.

526
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,150
Maybe it's a glitch.

527
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,612
Or maybe it's poetic justice !

528
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,290
Shuttle comin' ! Shuttle ! Shuttle !

529
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,835
Shuttle comin', Pa ! Look !

530
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:59,343
Praise the Lord for bringing us this generous bounty.

531
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:04,765
My sons... gather the harvest.

532
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,522
So maybe you're here as some sort of field trip.

533
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:13,941
Yeah !

534
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,778
Maybe this is some sort of... surprise party.

535
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:21,114
Whoo ! Gonna catch me some city boy !

536
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:29,164
lt's payback time, Dredd !

537
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,061
Dredd, what's happening ?

538
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:58,861
By a blast of God they perish.

539
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,989
And by a breath of His nostrils are they consumed.

540
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:05,951
Hallelujah !

541
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,838
Central, l need you to access graphics data base.

542
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,340
l want you to run an l.D. on this man.

543
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:23,051
Scanning for identity. nknown male,

544
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:27,431
approximately 200 centimeters tall, skin tone three.

545
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:29,516
ten, nine, eight..

546
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:34,104
Central ? Hello ?

547
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:38,192
This terminal has been terminated from the main system.

548
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:42,029
Your authority has been removed, Judge Hershey.

549
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:52,664
This is Group Leader. We've located the shuttle.

550
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:04,134
This is Capture Team. There's no sign of Dredd.

551
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:06,762
He appears to have survived the crash.

552
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,307
You are in error, Capture Team. No one survived the shuttle wreck.

553
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,601
Understand ? Just find Dredd !

554
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,978
The pilot, sir. He's alive.

555
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:18,315
No one survived the shuttle wreck ! Do l make myself clear ?

556
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,983
Yes, sir.

557
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,835
Am l dead ?

558
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:41,255
Am l dead ? l'm dead !

559
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,596
- Awake !

560
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,265
Good !

561
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:56,061
We're running out of sinners.

562
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,729
Oh, my God !

563
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:08,156
- Dredd, do something ! - Dredd ?

564
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:11,201
You talk too much.

565
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,744
Can it be ?

566
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:31,096
The great man of the Law himself.

567
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:40,397
O Lord, you have blessed us indeed !

568
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,194
Judge "rat" Dredd.

569
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,070
You creeps are under arrest.

570
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:49,364
ls that so ?

571
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,533
Let me crush him, Pa.

572
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:55,412
- Excuse me. We're not together.

573
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:59,041
Allow me to introduce you to my family.

574
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,085
- There's Link, my oldest. - Bite me !

575
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,337
Hi !

576
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,631
My youngest, Junior.

577
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,799
- Howdy. - Hi !

578
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:12,095
And this here is Mean.

579
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:16,350
We had to make some alterations when he was a child.

580
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,603
The Cursed Earth's a tough place on young folks.

581
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:24,483
l now have him set on one. l don't suggest you make him angry.

582
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:28,445
The legendary Angel family.

583
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,990
Cursed Earth pirates,

584
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:35,452
murderers, scavengers.

585
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:40,958
- And, of course, scumbags. - Oh, that'll win 'em over !

586
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,086
Did l leave something out, Pa ?

587
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,380
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. l want his ears. - l want his teeth.

588
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:57,224
Does that come with a fork, handsome ?

589
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,776
Hallelujah, brother !

590
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,279
Wait a minute. Can it be ?

591
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:13,282
Can it be that from the city of the fallen...

592
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:16,201
- we have one of the faithful ? - Amen, brother !

593
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:21,206
- Praise the Lord ! l'm a believer ! - Fergie, don't do it.

594
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:23,834
lt sounds like we have a believer in the gallery.

595
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,586
- Yes ! - Cut him down !

596
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,880
- Go tell it on the mountain ! - Fergie.

597
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:34,678
You're making a big mistake.

598
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,890
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law doesn't make mistakes,

599
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:41,226
but l'm free and you're toast.

600
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,271
Actually, you're toast.

601
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:48,650
l forgot to mention it. Your new friends,

602
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,611
they're cannibals.

603
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,284
- Fresh meat. - Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.

604
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,578
No, wait. You can't eat me !

605
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:03,332
l've got eczema. l've got warts. l've had gonorrhea.

606
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:06,376
Eat Dredd. He works out.

607
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:11,590
Yum, yum. lt's been fun, Lawman.

608
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:17,095
Finish Dredd.

609
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:19,806
My pleasure, Pa.

610
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,892
Come on.

611
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:28,482
Come on !

612
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,193
Come on, Junior !

613
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:33,278
- Guilty !

614
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,575
- Shut up !

615
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:49,334
- Dredd, look out !

616
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:57,467
There's Dredd !

617
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:13,942
- Go !

618
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:46,474
Well, we did it. We got 'em all.

619
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,852
- Hmm. - Pussies! ls that all you got ?

620
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,146
They are dead, right ?

621
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:54,274
Have you been crying ?

622
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,985
l'm not crying. l got something in my eye.

623
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,487
You ever have allergies ? Dredd, look out !

624
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:15,670
- Chief Justice ! - Joseph, together again.

625
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:17,839
Together again, sir.

626
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:23,386
- No !

627
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,979
- God, not again !

628
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:40,153
You got three strikes, Lawman !

629
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,490
Strike one.

630
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:46,326
Strike two !

631
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:51,623
Strike three.

632
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:54,251
You're out, Lawman !

633
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,587
You killed Link ! You killed Junior !

634
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:59,965
You killed my brothers !

635
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,467
You even killed my pa.

636
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,932
Mega City municipal code 4722:

637
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:12,269
lllegal use of city electricity.

638
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:14,771
- How do you plead ?

639
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:18,233
l knew you'd say that !

640
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:25,740
Graphics analysis now.

641
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:29,578
Olmeyer, you stupid futz ! l can't..

642
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:33,039
You analyzed the wrong viewie, all right. The wrong one. This one !

643
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:37,210
l don't believe it. You just wasted three hours.

644
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:41,047
lf this is the wrong picture,

645
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,884
Why is it fake ?

646
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:45,844
What ?

647
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:50,348
Look. lt's full of anomalies. Really clever ones too.

648
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:54,936
Somebody must've used a C.G.l. terminal and a scan quad to make this.

649
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:58,773
This is state-of-the-art... twenty years ago.

650
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:01,276
Are you saying this isn't real ?

651
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,613
Yeah. Look, l'll drop out all the artificial pixels.

652
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:08,992
Dad. Mom.

653
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,660
Foreground.

654
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,997
Background. All fake.

655
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:18,376
The only thing that's real is the baby.

656
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:32,140
Oh. The blind lady.

657
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:36,311
Who is she ?

658
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:39,981
Justice... before your time.

659
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:43,818
We should never have taken justice out of her hands.

660
00:56:43,944 --> 00:56:47,989
- You brought order to chaos, sir. - That we did.

661
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:51,952
Solved many problems, and created many more !

662
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:56,748
- Being a Judge, Joseph,

663
00:56:56,873 --> 00:57:01,336
perhaps too much power in one person's hands.

664
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:06,341
We once tried to compensate: create the perfect Judge.

665
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,426
We called it Janus.

666
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:11,555
Four decades ago,

667
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,268
D.N.A. samples were taken from the original Council.

668
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,854
One was chosen. Mine.

669
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:22,607
We altered it to enhance the best qualities...

670
00:57:22,816 --> 00:57:25,318
and screen out the worst:

671
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:28,029
weaknesses, frailties.

672
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:31,992
We created you.

673
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,788
You didn't create me, sir.

674
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,916
- l have a family. - No.

675
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:43,670
At the Academy, you told me they were killed when l was very young.

676
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:45,755
A lie.

677
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,884
l have a picture of them.

678
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:52,429
A fake. We lied... to both of you.

679
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:55,056
Both ?

680
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,894
There was another infant created in that experiment,

681
00:57:58,894 --> 00:58:02,022
but something went wrong.

682
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:05,358
Genetically mutated to the perfect criminal.

683
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:08,403
l have a brother ?

684
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:12,240
You were best friends at the Academy. Star pupils.

685
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,536
And then he turned. And for his crimes, you judged him.

686
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:21,208
Rico ?

687
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,544
Rico.

688
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:30,717
You let me judge my own brother ? You never told me, sir.

689
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,720
l couldn't !

690
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,559
You were like a son to me !

691
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:43,021
A son.

692
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:47,067
My whole life is a lie.

693
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:51,988
Rico had to be executed to protect you, to protect the city.

694
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:54,574
Rico.

695
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:59,913
Rico. He's alive!

696
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:04,584
No. l signed the order myself.

697
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:07,629
- l saw the report. - l didn't kill Hammond.

698
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:12,509
lt was him. lt was his D.N.A. that convicted me.

699
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:15,220
Griffin. Hmph. lt was Griffin.

700
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,097
Griffin, yes.

701
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:20,976
We've both been deceived, Joseph. l'm so sorry.

702
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:24,813
Rico's killed me and destroyed you !

703
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:28,358
fi.. find him, joseph.

704
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:31,695
Don't die.

705
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:18,825
What do we do ?

706
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,747
What do we do ?

707
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,498
Find Rico.

708
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,632
Welcome to Janus.

709
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:39,387
Rico, l think you know Dr. Hayden.

710
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:44,267
l remember you. Testified before the Council that l was insane, right ?

711
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:48,230
- And therefore innocent. - l was trying to save your life.

712
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,775
What you did was insult me, 'cause l knew exactly what l was doing.

713
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:54,277
Then and now.

714
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:11,294
Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter of this project for a long time.

715
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:16,091
She's kept it alive for me. l'm sure you'll find her expertise invaluable.

716
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:20,971
Excuse me ! All this is useless if you can't get into Central's Janus files,

717
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:23,265
'cause the Council has 'em locked.

718
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:28,061
Leave that to me. Meanwhile you have work to do... on the streets.

719
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:31,189
- llsa will help you. - l don't need no help ! Thanks.

720
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:37,863
l thought you said he was created here by the finest scientists of Mega City.

721
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:40,282
A bold experiment.

722
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,327
He's a petulant child.

723
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:48,498
Let's not bicker. We're here to achieve the same thing.

724
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,626
An ordered society.

725
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:57,591
You'll have your New Order.

726
01:01:59,134 --> 01:02:03,096
Attention, all Judges. Reporting unrest, code D-924.

727
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:06,224
Downtown, Sector 12. Backup requested.

728
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:25,410
Nineteen different explosions in 11 different sectors.

729
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,789
Extra caution to be taken on approach to 914..

730
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,671
Search all areas bordering the Elite Building.

731
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:41,259
The anonymous caller did not specify capacity. Proceed with caution.

732
01:03:01,488 --> 01:03:04,115
My boy !

733
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,123
Dredd, there's no way in !

734
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:16,920
Hello ? Are you even listening to me ?

735
01:03:17,045 --> 01:03:21,091
We can't just knock on the wall and say, "hello, cursed earth pizza."

736
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,385
There is a way in.

737
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,304
Six years ago, two refugees figured it out.

738
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:30,392
lt's a vent to the city's incinerator. There's a burst twice a minute.

739
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:32,352
That means somebody could run through that tube...

740
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:35,063
and have 30 seconds before it flames again.

741
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:40,402
And these, these refugees, they made it through, right ?

742
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:42,153
Actually, they were roasted.

743
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:46,324
But the theory's sound. Shall we ?

744
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,870
Maybe we should consider other theories. Dredd !

745
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:56,751
Dispatch, l'm in Green Quad 411. Need a pickup.

746
01:03:56,877 --> 01:04:00,088
Copy, Hershey. l have Central on-line for you.

747
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:02,591
Patch it to my Lawmaster.

748
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:13,143
Warning. Alien device on board.

749
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:15,645
Oh, my God !

750
01:04:18,356 --> 01:04:21,693
Latest casualty report: 96 Judges have been assassinated !

751
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:24,404
Whoever's doing this seems to know all our procedures,

752
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,781
our security measures, even our scrambled frequencies.

753
01:04:26,907 --> 01:04:30,118
With no Judges on the street, riots are breaking out all over Mega City.

754
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:32,412
We can't replace those Judges.

755
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:35,957
Even if we put the cadets on the street, we won't be at full strength for years !

756
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:38,168
There is a solution.

757
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:43,256
Project Janus.

758
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:45,967
This Council tried to play God once before.

759
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:50,764
lf this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues, there won't be a Council.

760
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:54,017
- Janus could.. - Janus could what ?

761
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,020
A new batch of test-tube babies won't solve this crisis.

762
01:04:57,145 --> 01:05:00,565
We don't need reliable Judges 20 years from now, we need them today !

763
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,945
Accelerated growth incubators are more developed now.

764
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:09,449
We could create adult subjects.

765
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:14,538
All l'm asking is that we unlock the Janus files.

766
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:17,374
That way we at least have an option !

767
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:21,628
lf the Council decides not to go forward,

768
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:25,382
l'll accept that decision... and resign.

769
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:37,269
- All right, you ready, kid ? - No !

770
01:05:37,394 --> 01:05:40,188
- Now what's wrong ? - What's wrong ? Are you kidding ?

771
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:43,316
Did wearing that helmet all those years compress your brain ?

772
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:45,819
- You're gonna get me killed. - There's a maniac loose in this city !

773
01:05:45,944 --> 01:05:47,070
What a coincidence !

774
01:05:47,195 --> 01:05:50,115
- There's one out here too ! - Oh.

775
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:54,786
Great time l'm having. The shuttle crash, the Cursed Earth, cannibals.

776
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:57,205
And now a fireball up my ass !

777
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:59,165
- This is all your fault ! - My fault ?

778
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:01,376
- Yes ! - You care to explain that, citizen ?

779
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:04,796
lf you hadn't arrested me, l wouldn't be here in the first place.

780
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:07,424
Hey, Dredd, what if you just kill me now ?

781
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:13,263
That's it ! l'm through schlepping.

782
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:17,100
l'm gonna stay here until l'm caught or 'til you apologize !

783
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:21,271
- The Law can't apologize ! - You're not the Law anymore.

784
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:24,399
Now apologize. l think l deserve that.

785
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,736
l've never apologized.

786
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:35,035
Now run !

787
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,871
Thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-eight,

788
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:40,373
- twenty-seven, twenty-six, - Run !

789
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:44,336
twenty-five, twenty-four, twenty-three, twenty-two,

790
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:46,713
twenty-one, nineteen..

791
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:51,092
Dredd ? Dredd !

792
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:54,971
Dredd ! l don't wanna die !

793
01:07:04,231 --> 01:07:06,107
Jump !

794
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:21,122
l'm alive !

795
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:22,916
l'm alive !

796
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:26,044
Oh... so are you.

797
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:32,300

01:07:58,994 --> 01:08:01,288
Password, origin.

807
01:08:01,371 --> 01:08:03,999
Janus file opened.

808
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,798
Attention. ntil emergency repairs are completed,

809
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:14,009
ward "c" locker room is off limits.

810
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:15,677
Psst.

811
01:08:17,012 --> 01:08:19,097
l'm lost. ls this the bathroom ?

812
01:08:19,222 --> 01:08:21,391
Hey !

813
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:24,436
Now you have to admit, l helped out on that one.

814
01:08:24,519 --> 01:08:27,355
l mean, that was all me, baby !

815
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,358
hey, hey, wh.. why are you taking off his clothes ?

816
01:08:32,027 --> 01:08:34,029
We don't have time for this.

817
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,620
Central, using current technology,

818
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:46,124
how long would it take for Janus to produce a fully-grown adult subject ?

819
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:49,044
Given the current state of genetic engineering,

820
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:52,672
an adult subject could be incubated in approximately eight hours.

821
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:57,260
- We could replace our losses in a day. - This is madness.

822
01:08:57,385 --> 01:08:59,137
Ah, Dredd ?

823
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:01,139
- Silence. - Dredd !

824
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:02,807
Shh. l'm busy.

825
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:05,393
Dredd ?

826
01:09:07,896 --> 01:09:11,858
lt's inhuman. lt's not for this Council to play God !

827
01:09:11,858 --> 01:09:15,195
No, Griffin. Please restore the security blocks.

828
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:20,825
lt seems none of you have the force of will that these times require.

829
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:24,162
Central, leave Janus unlocked.

830
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:28,041
Griffin, this is treason. You have just sealed your fate.

831
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:29,918
No !

832
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:33,672
You have just sealed yours ! Rico !

833
01:09:47,018 --> 01:09:49,938
Now who says politics is boring ?

834
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:52,732
- Hey, Dredd ! l thought it was you.

835
01:09:53,358 --> 01:09:56,069
That's right ! Cover your ears !

836
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:02,659
- Rico. - Joseph.

837
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:12,335
Get out of here... now !

838
01:10:14,004 --> 01:10:15,881
No !

839
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,762
- You're under arrest, Griffin. - Really ?

840
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:31,438
Stop him ! He just killed the entire Council !

841
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:34,858
- Move it out ! - Dredd, tell them l'm innocent.

842
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:52,792
Come on, Fergie ! Run !

843
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:55,837
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd. You know that ?

844
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,931
- What are you gonna do ? - Hope it works.

845
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:11,353
What is wrong with this piece of shit ?

846
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:22,822
That's a solid brick wall ! You're going to kill us !

847
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:34,000
Dredd ! You gotta make it work !

848
01:11:34,084 --> 01:11:35,752
Make it work !

849
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:38,797
Malfunction. Malfunction. On-line.

850
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:48,598
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat after we get off the bike.

851
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:51,309
- Hmm. - Sorry.

852
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:57,566
Dredd, move it !

853
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:15,792
- Fergie, cover the rear. - l've never fired a gun in my life !

854
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:19,337
- What kind of a criminal are you ? - A nice criminal.

855
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:26,011
- Nothing's happening ! - You gotta cock it first, moron.

856
01:12:26,136 --> 01:12:28,096
You didn't say anything about cocking.

857
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:30,599
Nice !

858
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:45,739
Stop ! Please, God !

859
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:03,965
You can drop me off here.

860
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:10,430
- Dredd, that's a dead end. - l know.

861
01:13:33,078 --> 01:13:35,038
Oh, God !

862
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,837
Fergie, take over !

863
01:13:41,837 --> 01:13:44,130
Where are you going ? Dredd !

864
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:47,133
- This is where you get off, creep !

865
01:13:55,183 --> 01:13:57,894
- Need a lift, kid ?

866
01:14:04,568 --> 01:14:06,862
l'm never riding with you again, Dredd !

867
01:14:18,623 --> 01:14:21,668
She's definitely not gonna get her cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.

868
01:14:23,837 --> 01:14:28,550
lt doesn't pay to be one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry !

869
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:43,356
Hands against the wall. You know the drill.

870
01:14:46,568 --> 01:14:47,944
- who are you ? - Dredd said that..

871
01:14:48,028 --> 01:14:50,030
Shut up !

872
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:52,616
- What happened ? - Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh ?

873
01:14:52,616 --> 01:14:57,204
We're dyin' out there ! 108 Judges in 48 hours !

874
01:14:57,204 --> 01:15:00,540
What the hell is going on ?

875
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,209
You think l'm part of this ?

876
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:05,545
l don't know who or what you are anymore.

877
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,972
l would never do anything to hurt you, Hersh.

878
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,017
You know that.

879
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:26,816
All right.

880
01:15:26,942 --> 01:15:29,653
You tell me about him, huh ?

881
01:15:29,736 --> 01:15:33,406
You make me believe in you like l did when l defended you.

882
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,743
His name is Rico...

883
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:39,120
and he's my brother.

884
01:15:39,246 --> 01:15:42,457
The D.N.A. sample has been taken out of frozen stasis.

885
01:15:42,582 --> 01:15:47,879
- Ready for cloning process. - We got a slight change of plans here.

886
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:51,424
l want to take the existing D.N.A. sample right now and trash it.

887
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:55,595
Activate this D.N.A. sampling console.

888
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,223
What are you doing ?

889
01:15:58,306 --> 01:16:03,228
Central, take... this D.N.A. sample now.

890
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:05,397
This wasn't part of our plan !

891
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:07,899
Judge Griffin would never have authorized this !

892
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:09,359
Processing.

893
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,321
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper by puttin' me behind bars.

894
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:18,535
What's your excuse ?

895
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:25,208
You said l had no feelings and no emotions.

896
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,294
Now you know why.

897
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:30,964
Dredd... look at me.

898
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:37,929
The Janus project didn't do that to you. You did that to yourself.

899
01:16:39,723 --> 01:16:41,683
Sorry, guys, l'm getting nowhere with your terminal.

900
01:16:41,808 --> 01:16:45,228
But l fixed the microwave. You want some popcorn ?

901
01:16:46,188 --> 01:16:47,731
ls this a bad time ?

902
01:16:47,856 --> 01:16:52,736
Look, l tried dialing everything l could think of to find this Janus thing.

903
01:16:52,736 --> 01:16:56,406
lt just isn't in the program. Nowhere. Nothing.

904
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:59,326
They'd never take a chance and put it on the computer network...

905
01:16:59,409 --> 01:17:01,828
but they need power and they're gonna steal it from somewhere.

906
01:17:01,912 --> 01:17:04,956
Check every sector for recent blackouts and sudden power surges.

907
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,042
- Great. Let's stay here longer ! - Wait a second.

908
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:10,879
Just before they blew up my Lawmaster in Sector Four,

909
01:17:10,879 --> 01:17:14,633
there was a power surge, a really big one, three blocks wide.

910
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:16,510
The last time l felt something like that,

911
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:19,137
they shut down the whole power grid in that area, remember ?

912
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:21,515
When they moved the Statue of Liberty, they put it right down on top of it.

913
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,808
- Right. - Could we go now ?

914
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:28,104
Dredd... that's twice you owe me.

915
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:36,530
Rico ! Dredd got away from the hunters.

916
01:17:36,655 --> 01:17:39,574
Well, he's about to be seriously outnumbered.

917
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:42,577
- Right, Central ? - Affirmative, Judge Rico.

918
01:17:42,702 --> 01:17:44,996
The new D.N.A. sample has been multiplexed,

919
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,165
and the gametes are already dividing.

920
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:48,959
New sample ?

921
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:51,336
You left that D.N.A. in there for over 30 years !

922
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:53,755
Sooner or later, somebody's gonna clean out the fridge.

923
01:17:53,839 --> 01:17:58,426
That sample was created from the finest specimens on the Council of Judges !

924
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:01,054
What did you replace it with ?

925
01:18:02,097 --> 01:18:04,891
No. My God.

926
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:08,353
You should congratulate me right now, 'cause l'm about to be a daddy.

927
01:18:08,436 --> 01:18:10,647
You're being very, very rude.

928
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,607
You don't know what you're doing !

929
01:18:12,732 --> 01:18:16,695
The next batch of Janus Judges are not going to be the puppets that you want !

930
01:18:16,778 --> 01:18:20,115
They're gonna be my brothers and sisters ! And mine to control !

931
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,869
l can't let you do this. you're both insane ! l have to stop..

932
01:18:29,499 --> 01:18:33,795
Central... help me !

933
01:18:33,879 --> 01:18:36,298
l'm sorry, Chief Justice, the A.B.C. robot...

934
01:18:36,298 --> 01:18:38,800
is not tied into my main processor.

935
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,429
That's right, Griff. You gotta get with this high-tech stuff.

936
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:46,099
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off. - No !

937
01:18:46,183 --> 01:18:49,227
And you save his head for last. l don't want him to miss anything !

938
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:51,313
- Anything ! - No !

939
01:18:55,358 --> 01:18:58,069
- Fergie, you stay here. - By myself?

940
01:18:58,195 --> 01:19:01,323
You'll need me to shut down the Janus system. We're a team.

941
01:19:01,406 --> 01:19:04,117
Granted, you do most of the work, but we're still a team.

942
01:19:04,117 --> 01:19:06,620
- l'll handle it, kid. - l bring you luck.

943
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:10,290
- Luck ? - You are still alive, Dredd.

944
01:19:10,373 --> 01:19:12,167
Hmm.

945
01:19:27,807 --> 01:19:30,727
- l'm getting a signal.

946
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:35,398
lt's close. lt's moving closer !

947
01:19:36,858 --> 01:19:39,152
Jesus Christ !

948
01:19:39,152 --> 01:19:41,571
Get back !

949
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,200
No !

950
01:19:48,036 --> 01:19:50,830
Dredd !

951
01:19:57,629 --> 01:19:59,589
Drop the gun.

952
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,594
Robot, on the count of three, break her neck.

953
01:20:05,637 --> 01:20:07,222
one, two..

954
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:09,599
No !

955
01:20:13,687 --> 01:20:17,524
- Hershey ? - l'm still here.

956
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:22,320
- How romantic. Step inside.

957
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:33,290
He looks a lot like you.

958
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:34,958
He looks a lot like you.

959
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,918
He is a lot like me.

960
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:39,754
l am nothing like you.

961
01:20:39,838 --> 01:20:41,715
The only difference between us, Joseph,

962
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,303
is you destroyed your life... to embrace the Law.

963
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:49,139
And l destroyed the Law... to embrace life.

964
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:56,229
And speaking of life, send in the clones.

965
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:02,986
Behold !

966
01:21:19,377 --> 01:21:21,880
This is where you were born.

967
01:21:21,963 --> 01:21:23,840
Feel that magic ?

968
01:21:24,883 --> 01:21:28,637
But you must've known all along...

969
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:30,639
you were different.

970
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:38,647
Fergie... are you still alive ?

971
01:21:38,772 --> 01:21:42,317
Technically... yes.

972
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:50,242
Your brothers and your sisters.

973
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:52,327
Be born in two hours.

974
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:56,790
One big, endless supply of perfection.

975
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,169
You know, we have a choice. We can stand here right now...

976
01:22:01,169 --> 01:22:05,465
and create a whole race of brainwashed morons, and call them Judges.

977
01:22:05,549 --> 01:22:08,051
Or we can create some freethinking people.

978
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:11,096
We'll call them human.

979
01:22:12,556 --> 01:22:15,684
Human.

980
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:21,106
You could never control yourself.

981
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:24,734
What makes you think you can control... these things ?

982
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:28,196
'Cause you're in control.

983
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,699
You be head of the Council.

984
01:22:30,782 --> 01:22:35,078
You choose, and you choose quickly too.

985
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:39,875
l should've put you down myself... personally !

986
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:42,794
You know, l never understood that.

987
01:22:42,878 --> 01:22:46,965
Why did you judge me ? Why did you judge me ?

988
01:22:47,048 --> 01:22:49,050
- You killed innocent people. - The means to an end.

989
01:22:49,134 --> 01:22:51,136
- You started a massacre. - l caused a revolution.

990
01:22:51,219 --> 01:22:54,264
- You betrayed the Law ! - Law !

991
01:22:54,347 --> 01:22:57,184
l betrayed this !

992
01:22:57,267 --> 01:23:02,272
Your Council's experiment, which failed in you !

993
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:04,900
l was your brother, your blood, your friend.

994
01:23:06,234 --> 01:23:08,528
Who betrayed who ?

995
01:23:08,528 --> 01:23:11,865
When are you gonna stop being a goddamn slave and grow up ?

996
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:13,867
That's your birthright, that's your family.

997
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:17,412
l'm your family. l'm the only family you ever had !

998
01:23:18,747 --> 01:23:20,832
Now choose !

999
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:28,548
The best thing you can do is kill me.

1000
01:23:28,548 --> 01:23:30,550
Why ?

1001
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:35,972
Because it's your only chance... brother.

1002
01:23:37,432 --> 01:23:40,018
Fido !

1003
01:23:41,686 --> 01:23:44,314
Rip this bitch's arms and legs off.

1004
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:46,900
- Save her pretty head for my brother. - Don't do it !

1005
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,902
Halt !

1006
01:23:50,237 --> 01:23:53,573
Rip his head off instead. Give it to her.

1007
01:23:57,869 --> 01:23:59,829
What's the matter with you ?

1008
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:02,958
Rico !

1009
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:07,671
- Boy, is he pissed ! - Fergie !

1010
01:24:10,465 --> 01:24:13,802
Dredd !

1011
01:24:13,927 --> 01:24:16,721
- Get him, Dredd ! - Hang on, Fergie.

1012
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:23,311
Hack you, asshole.

1013
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,731
Rico !

1014
01:24:28,608 --> 01:24:31,111
Central, hatch that first set of clones.

1015
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:33,196
The cloning process is not finished, Judge Rico.

1016
01:24:33,321 --> 01:24:35,699
The clones will be only 60?o complete.

1017
01:24:35,824 --> 01:24:39,661
l need reinforcements. Hatch the goddamn clones now !

1018
01:24:51,548 --> 01:24:54,259
Don't fight much, do you ?

1019
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:34,716
Bitch !

1020
01:25:34,716 --> 01:25:36,801
lt's Judge Bitch !

1021
01:26:25,308 --> 01:26:27,811
l'm the only one who never lied to you.

1022
01:26:27,894 --> 01:26:30,939
l'll be the judge of that.

1023
01:26:56,381 --> 01:27:00,135
Now, Joseph Dredd, l hereby judge you.

1024
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:06,933
To the charge of betraying your flesh... guilty.

1025
01:27:07,142 --> 01:27:12,981
To the charge of being human, when we could have been Gods... guilty.

1026
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:15,901
The sentence is death.

1027
01:27:15,984 --> 01:27:18,612
Don't miss.

1028
01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:21,281
Lethal round is exhausted.

1029
01:27:24,367 --> 01:27:26,953
Signal flare !

1030
01:27:29,372 --> 01:27:31,541
Court is adjourned.

1031
01:27:43,929 --> 01:27:46,723
Dredd.

1032
01:28:02,322 --> 01:28:04,908
Give me your hand.

1033
01:28:05,033 --> 01:28:08,245
That's three times now, Dredd.

1034
01:28:20,131 --> 01:28:22,425
Stay in back, Hershey.

1035
01:28:26,971 --> 01:28:30,933
- Am l under arrest ? - That won't be necessary.

1036
01:28:31,141 --> 01:28:34,270
Central broadcast the Janus plan after Griffin's death.

1037
01:28:34,353 --> 01:28:36,564
They all know the truth.

1038
01:28:36,647 --> 01:28:40,109
Judge Dredd, we have to reconstitute the Council.

1039
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,406
We'd like you to consider the first position of Chief Justice.

1040
01:28:45,948 --> 01:28:47,825
l'm a Street Judge.

1041
01:28:47,867 --> 01:28:51,161
And l'm very late for work. Thank you, Olmeyer.

1042
01:28:51,203 --> 01:28:55,958
l am dying. l'm too young.. excuse me.

1043
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,669
Oh, that's great ! He gets all the credit.

1044
01:28:58,711 --> 01:29:00,546
Dredd ?

1045
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:02,631
l taught him everything he knows.

1046
01:29:02,673 --> 01:29:06,177
Dredd, that's it ?

1047
01:29:07,636 --> 01:29:09,096
No good-bye ?

1048
01:29:09,138 --> 01:29:11,390
Good-bye, Hershey.

1049
01:29:18,898 --> 01:29:22,401
To tell you the truth, l'm probably a much better kisser.

1050
01:29:22,443 --> 01:29:26,197
Ow ! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya ? Can we swing by a cash machine ?

1051
01:29:36,207 --> 01:29:38,501
Feels good to be human, don't you think ?

1052
01:29:38,542 --> 01:29:43,088
l knew you'd say that.

1053
01:30:01,857 --> 01:30:10,616
