1
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,400
BEASTLY

2
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,975
And the next candidate
for Buckston High School

3
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,680
Green Committee President,
Kyle Kingson.

4
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,993
True or false...

5
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:41,001
you are an aggressively
unattractive person.

6
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,698
Hatchet face, face-ache,
face like burnt lego?

7
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,907
Or did you only
just miss the beauty boat.

8
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:53,304
Any which way,
best embrace the suck.

9
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,214
Beautiful people get it better.

10
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:58,214
That's just the way it is.

11
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:11,332
So-So...what does this got to do

12
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,197
with running for
Green Committee President?

13
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,669
Not much. Except...

14
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,366
you'll never elect me 'cause of
my commitment to the environment.

15
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:24,370
I don't have one.
I want this for my transcript.

16
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,279
But what you got to ask yourselves is,

17
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:30,078
should you vote for me just
because I'm the rich, popular,

18
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:33,585
goodlooking guy with the famous dad?

19
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,887
And the answer is, hell yeah.

20
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,047
Palm of your hand, man,
palm of your hand.

21
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,244
Stellar Angels in America essay.

22
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,345
I appreciate all the extra time
you spent with me, Mr. Bernstein.

23
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:09,949
You hate that teacher's guts.

24
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,254
Whatever it takes,
'til the college recs are in.

25
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,759
Speech killed.

26
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,661
Speaking of killing, you see that
ball-biting, voodoo-tatted slut.

27
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,858
But really, who gives?
Stick to my mantra

28
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,161
steer clear of the witch.

29
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,259
I'll put it out of your head later.

30
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,466
What the shit?

31
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:40,878
Maybe it's just me,

32
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,684
but shouldn't whoever runs
the Green Committee

33
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,384
actually care about things green?

34
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,496
Or be green, like the rest of
your facially disabled coven?

35
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,997
Throw it to someone deserving.

36
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,897
Lindy Taylor's only going for Treasurer

37
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,696
because she knew she couldn't win
President against you.

38
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,599
No, no, no. I...

39
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,696
But I think we're all hoping that
in the privacy of the voting booth

40
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,936
your bandwagoneers will stop
fearing for their social lives

41
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,738
and make the right choice.

42
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,043
And might I just add,

43
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,740
looks are important to you.

44
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,551
They're important to everyone.

45
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,246
Except you, clearly.

46
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,257
Appreciate the smear campaign
and kudos to you and

47
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,764
your bitchcrafty friend
for staging a little coup,

48
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,265
but if you wanted Prez,
you shoulda had...

49
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,961
Actually, I don't want Prez,

50
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,560
I don't know Kendra and
I don't let others speak for me.

51
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,165
But maybe that's just me being
the defensive scholarship kid. So,

52
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:35,470
best of luck tomorrow.

53
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,776
And it's nice to finally meet you
after three years.

54
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,400
How are you?

55
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,735
Not bad.

56
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,135
Elections today.

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,442
Great.

58
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,941
No, not you. I was talking to my son.

59
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,448
- Did us proud.
- Yeah, all right.

60
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,851
Experimented with heroin too.

61
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,753
Terrific. Uh, wait, hold on. Jill,
I got to go.

62
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,956
Hey, I'm sorry, Jill got canned.

63
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,956
Yeah, it's probably the way
the baby ten looked on camera.

64
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,961
and she's a big-boned girl
to begin with.

65
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,266
People like people who look good.

66
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,962
Anyone who says otherwise
is dumb or ugly.

67
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,166
- Who's Jill?
- I told you about her.

68
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,265
I don't think so.

69
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,874
And I know this because
the last time we had a conversation

70
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,175
that lasted more than five minutes
was sophomore year.

71
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,772
I hear you.
Why don't you leave me alone?

72
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,283
When I told you I had brain cancer.

73
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,520
And? Oh, shoot. Hang on.

74
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,529
Rob Kingson.

75
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,038
What?

76
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,433
Nothing. I say good night.

77
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,138
Why, 'cause you need to get home
to your sixteen children?

78
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,444
My three children live in Jamaica
with their father, which you know.

79
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,848
Do me a favor.

80
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,747
Save the sob stories

81
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,153
for your heart-to-hearts with Mr. Clean.

82
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,257
You no vex me,

83
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:32,957
you stoosh ginnygog.

84
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:38,364
And next year's GC president
Kyle Kingson.

85
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,568
Josh Black, please report
to the principal's office.

86
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,782
Don't think it was a landslide,
if it makes you feel better.

87
00:06:58,853 --> 00:06:59,785
And... and I'm sorry.

88
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,287
Is bullshit one word or two?

89
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,822
No, it's not...
And I want to make it up to you.

90
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,518
I get two Green Party VIP passes.

91
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:09,120
Scores you greenroom access,
that kinda thing. want one?

92
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,423
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

93
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,527
- So I'd be like, going with you?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,237
What about your girl friend?

95
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,938
Deep-fried barbie doll
e-dumped me last night.

96
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,533
Hey, I don't know
what game this is, but I'll play.

97
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,236
Really?

98
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,746
Everyone deserves a second chance.

99
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,147
Besides, you know what
they say about me, don't you?

100
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,951
Vicious gossip.

101
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,045
And only idiots screw with witches.

102
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,149
Careful now.

103
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,871
Tell me you did not
get a cheap-ass rose.

104
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,164
Them no have the orchid.

105
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,265
They didn't have it?

106
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,072
I told you two weeks ago
to order it.

107
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,873
You tell me yesterday,

108
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,071
But listen.

109
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,515
"A symbol of humility,
the white rose also say,

110
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,216
'I am loyal and worthy of you.'"

111
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,922
WTF?

112
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,131
And it also means
I am loyal and worthy of you.

113
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,829
- Go blow a goat.
- I'm sorry.

114
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,336
The orchid was
this year's yellow ribbon.

115
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:25,838
It was a political statement.

116
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,636
Thanks for making me
look like an insensitive bitch.

117
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,646
I mean does it suck so bad?

118
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,246
No, it's... badass.

119
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,248
Did I ever congratulate you
on treasurer?

120
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:48,159
Probably never apologized for
my aholian election behavior either.

121
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,958
Well... two weeks ago
was the first and last time

122
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,156
you spoke to me in three years.

123
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,665
So, um... no.

124
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,967
Sorry on all counts.

125
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:57,361
Got to slave here all night?

126
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:58,666
Slaving all year.

127
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,671
Work-study?

128
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,208
Yeah. I'm saving
for the Machu Picchu trip.

129
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,504
But my shift's almost over.

130
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,102
Just in time for the real fun.

131
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,511
Yeah, right.

132
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,708
She blows it off. Too cool for school?

133
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,415
Definitely not. Just...

134
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,918
Not your thing.

135
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,222
That, and... well, that.

136
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,723
What can I say?
I'm substance over style.

137
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,125
A dying breed.

138
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,628
Never too late to join.

139
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,630
Think I already drank the kool-aid.

140
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,125
Always hope.

141
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,633
- Take a picture with me.
- What?

142
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,834
School newspaper.

143
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,337
But I'll need to approve it
before it runs.

144
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:41,947
Hold up.

145
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,746
- What else'll I do with it?
- "I'm worthy of you."

146
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,451
What?

147
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,047
What white roses mean.

148
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,649
Lamecore, I know.

149
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,559
And obviously not what I,
uh, thought you meant.

150
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,354
No, it's just...

151
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,896
See you later.

152
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,301
Don't be a stranger.

153
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,502
- What's with her?
- Pity mack.

154
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,205
Cause you got a flesh-eater
at 4 o'clock.

155
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,207
And here we go.

156
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,616
You actually bought it.

157
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,417
You bought that I'd hook up with you

158
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,222
the self-mutilated, tatted Frankenskank

159
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,957
who publicly humiliated me,
almost cost me the election?

160
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,555
No dice, sunshine.

161
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,259
But hey, you can buy a ticket.

162
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,267
Or here's a secret.

163
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,365
Sometimes they let you
in just 'cause you're eyecandy.

164
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,471
She eye-candy?

165
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,779
Rules are she needs a ticket.

166
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,478
Ah well, que sera, sera.

167
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:27,180
Spanish for sucks to be an ugly cow.

168
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,480
I only came to give you a second chance.

169
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,687
- Guess I blew it.
- I Guess so.

170
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,692
But Kyle?

171
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,590
Best embrace the suck.

172
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,163
Relax. Kyle,
I already forgave you. Come on.

173
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,567
God, you're sweating like a pig.

174
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,270
You see the way she looked at me?

175
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,280
So what?

176
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,173
- I got to go.
- Kyle.

177
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,858
How are you feeling, Kyle?

178
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:18,059
Kendra? what're you doing here?

179
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,568
I'm here for everyone
who just missed the beauty boat.

180
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,068
What?

181
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,272
And all the self-mutilating,
tatted Frankenskanks.

182
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,466
It was Ajoke.

183
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,668
I didn't get it.

184
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,672
But pretty soon, you will.

185
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,775
You have a year to find
someone to love you.

186
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,577
Before the tree blooms again.

187
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,789
When the spring flowers bloom again,
the year is up,

188
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,687
And either the words "I love you"
will release you from the spell

189
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,698
or stay like this forever.

190
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:53,698
Like what?

191
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,103
No!

192
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,338
No!

193
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,545
No!

194
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,053
As aggressively unattractive outside
as you are inside.

195
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,053
Wait!

196
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,957
You have a year
to find someone to love you.

197
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:25,155
or stay like this forever.

198
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:50,889
Dad.

199
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,287
Jesus, you scared me.

200
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,884
Don't turn on the light.

201
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,892
- Why?
- Please.

202
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,299
What's going on?

203
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,126
Why do you love me?

204
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,327
Kind of a question is that?

205
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,929
- Just answer it.
- Because you're my son.

206
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,839
But-But do you believe in magic?

207
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,538
Magic? what the hell are you--

208
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,150
Kyle?

209
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,949
His vision and hearing.

210
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,856
That's all you've got?

211
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:30,863
And, of course, his insides are just
as normal as-as they were before,

212
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,456
but the skin won't change
no matter what we do.

213
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,059
Now, what about skin grafts
or face transplants?

214
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,162
I mean, look at him, look at him.

215
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,567
He doesn't want to live life
looking like this.

216
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:43,974
We'd risk anything.

217
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,376
What?

218
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,980
Kyle, we are going to
find somebody else.

219
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm not taking
"no" from Dr. Crap-For-Brains.

220
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:53,979
We will fix this.

221
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,386
Yes, because we'd risk anything,
including me dying.

222
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,686
No-No, that's not what I meant.
It just came out that way.

223
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,284
Or did it come out
because that is what you meant?

224
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,728
No.

225
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,530
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

226
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,440
What do you think, Kyle?

227
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,741
It's private, safe.

228
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,046
People can't be spying all the time.

229
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:28,245
Plus, I'm thinking I might get you
that motorcycle you've always wanted.

230
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,352
Where's your room?

231
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,856
It's right across the hall.

232
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,257
Don't worry. I will take care of
whatever you need.

233
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,567
Still need to get my stuff.

234
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,071
But we're keeping the place in the city?

235
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,670
So I can crash there late nights
if need be.

236
00:16:58,952 --> 00:16:59,884
Dad?

237
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,918
Yeah?

238
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,327
Hey, hey.

239
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:22,639
Okay, I have a four-o'clock call,
so I will check in right after that.

240
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,543
And Zola's right here. Okay?

241
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:28,940
Who're you?

242
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,133
Mary Poppins.

243
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,346
The tutor. Uh, your dad hired me.
I'm supposed to move in today.

244
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,645
Tell my father
he can carpe diem in hell.

245
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:43,955
Happy to.

246
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,254
Meantime, how about you cage the rage

247
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,454
and invite me in
for a nice, hot bowl of Dad sucks?

248
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,162
Saw right through that one, Oprah?

249
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,756
Yeah, it's a little gift I have.

250
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,667
Especially since I can't actually see.

251
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,911
- Hi, I am will.
- Come in.

252
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,518
I'll get Zola.
She'll welcome you to hell,

253
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,920
fix you up with your own bedroom,
and explain what happened to me and-

254
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,921
and what I did to deserve this.

255
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,722
Oh, and please-please, hang with us.

256
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,425
Gouge the old man
for everything he's worth.

257
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,028
He deserves it.

258
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,633
You know what? Obviously, he forgot

259
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,434
to spin the borderline hostile act
of hiring a blind guy

260
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,134
to tutor his creepshow son.

261
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,234
As for learning calculus,
I think I'll take a pass.

262
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,346
Nice to meet you.

263
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,150
Sorry, I come back later.

264
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,972
How old are your kids?

265
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:13,779
Sixteen, thirteen, ten.

266
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,492
You just left them?

267
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,995
Can't get them green cards.

268
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,794
But you left them.

269
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,604
Parents do what
they do with what they know.

270
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,501
They were not very big when I leave.

271
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,706
It was five years.

272
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,511
For my little one, it is half his life.

273
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,719
There is a hole in my heart.

274
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,263
So I know your father will come.

275
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,557
I don't think so.

276
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,681
Rob Kingson. Leave a message.

277
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,681
It's me.

278
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,490
Could you do me a favor?

279
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:40,795
I, uh, I know we were
rescheduling for the next week,

280
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,804
or maybe it was the week after, but...

281
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,909
Maybe we should...

282
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,504
Maybe we should
just not pretend anymore.

283
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,662
Sweet.

284
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,982
Kendra!

285
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,481
Kendra!

286
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,579
Kendra! Kendra!

287
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,488
I am begging you.

288
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,984
Please make it end. Please.

289
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,688
I can't do that.

290
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,695
But-But I get it.

291
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,096
I--I know what it's
like to be shit-ugly.

292
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:57,300
So-So you got me, five months is enough,

293
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,701
I learned the lesson.

294
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,703
You learned nothing.

295
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:04,234
Find someone
who can see better than you can.

296
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,741
Seven more months
for someone to say, "I love you."

297
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,851
Please! Make this go away!

298
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:23,661
Sloan?

299
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:29,959
That sounded like Kyle, didn't it?

300
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:34,166
Weird. I suck not writing him back.

301
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,764
I suck more.

302
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:40,370
Well, but honestly,
with him gone, it's kind of a relief.

303
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,574
Like, I always felt like I had to be on

304
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,985
and mean, like really mean...
to keep him entertained.

305
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,183
And I know what you mean.

306
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,188
Hey.

307
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,285
Sorry.

308
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:02,126
And I'm sorry to spy on you, spying.

309
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,229
Unbelievable.

310
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,642
But it does sorta feel like
the death of romance unfolding

311
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,042
before your very eyes, doesn't it?

312
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,744
Doesn't she have a boyfriend?

313
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:18,147
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

314
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,947
What happened to romance?

315
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:25,951
Sappy, soppy longhand love letters

316
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:33,060
and you really, really don't have
to keep listening to me, by the way.

317
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:36,459
Thing is that guy
they were talking about?

318
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,367
They're way off.

319
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:42,674
Personally I respect that
he called things as he saw them,

320
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,577
even if he did see them wrong.

321
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,970
Do you know what it really was?

322
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:48,979
What?

323
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,479
He was a shot of life.

324
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:39,657
You're kidding, right?

325
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,969
How do you do that?

326
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:55,077
I went to this dance and
some emo chick gave me a dart hex.

327
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,172
Bite me.

328
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,977
Oh hey, now you're up,
want to learn something?

329
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,323
- No!
- Be careful.

330
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,818
Lose your smarts, blondes
will be telling jokes about you.

331
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,931
My dad always said that
how much people like you

332
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,735
is directly proportional to
what you look like.

333
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:31,746
But they hated me.

334
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,750
High school unquestionably sucks ass.

335
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,658
You went to regular school?

336
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,459
At fifteen,
my friends lost their virginity.

337
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,060
I lost my sight.

338
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,261
But living hell has its upside.

339
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,765
- Like better hearing?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,274
And chicks dig blind guys.

341
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,712
Too bad they don't dig ugly guys.

342
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:05,416
How do you know?

343
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,189
Defying expectations,

344
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:27,283
Blindie keeps up
his bitchin' sense of style.

345
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,692
A holdover from my seeing days.

346
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,794
Point being, no matter what,
how you look matters?

347
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:40,100
Point being, it's not about
how others look at me,

348
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:42,900
it's about how I look at myself.

349
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,602
Mental Rubiks cube, I know,

350
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,909
but one day it'll make sense.

351
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:35,873
Ass-wipe.

352
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,882
You have the humor of a marmot.

353
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:43,588
So, I heard someone
sneaking in late last night.

354
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:44,588
Where'd you go?

355
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:48,889
Isn't the benefit of having
no parents that you have no parents?

356
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,087
Get off my back.

357
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:54,690
But, uh, you know, since we last talked,

358
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,200
I've been thinking and...

359
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,199
is there any kind of eye operation?

360
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,832
'Cause I saw, like,
every doctor in the country.

361
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,041
Miracles only, but thanks.

362
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,936
So where did you go last night?

363
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,847
I went to see about this girl.

364
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,853
I'm so happy for you!

365
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:16,752
I didn't even talk to her.

366
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,451
Baby steps. You think
you might say, "wassup?"

367
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:24,053
The benefit of you being blind
is you can't see

368
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,155
how I should so never say, "wassup."

369
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:31,461
Baby steps. we must celebrate.

370
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:36,467
One, two, three. wassup!

371
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,668
Fore!

372
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:42,371
One, two, three. wassup!

373
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,880
Wassup.

374
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,578
Wassup!

375
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,950
- Here's a sandwich, Ben.
- Thanks.

376
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,449
How's your dad? Stayin' out of trouble?

377
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,860
Dad, I'm home. Dad?

378
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,260
Come on.

379
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,864
Dad!

380
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,553
I don't have it.
Please, Victor, come on.

381
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,884
Just hook me up.

382
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,091
Just another week.
I just need a little more time.

383
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,720
No-No-No, I'm not screwing around,
you sorry-ass addict.

384
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,026
- Dad, not this again.
- I'm sorry, Lindy

385
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:08,225
Hey, shut up. And you get out of here.

386
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,427
Victor, please.
We'll get you your money.

387
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:13,931
Give me and my brother our money.

388
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:15,639
Dad!

389
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,542
No!

390
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,317
Where is she?

391
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,028
You killed him.

392
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,132
Your daughter for my brother.

393
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,828
Someday I'll find her.

394
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:21,438
I wouldn't.

395
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,537
What do you need?

396
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,638
Come on, what do you want?

397
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:32,843
I want her.

398
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,852
I'm want to protect her.

399
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,252
I can protect her.

400
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,258
Please. Did you hear him?

401
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,055
If she stays with me,
she-she'll be safe.

402
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,866
I don't know who you are.

403
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,062
But if she leaves... If she leaves...

404
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,172
cops will get these.

405
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,807
No. It's just too twisted.

406
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,806
So's killing a man.

407
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,516
But what's she gonna think of you?

408
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:29,231
Zola, remember.
Hunter, not Kyle. Hunter.

409
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,742
Hello, I'm Zola.

410
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,748
- Where is he?
- You can go.

411
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,548
I'm not gonna just leave you here.

412
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:40,550
With some stranger?

413
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,052
Son of an old friend. For your safety.

414
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:46,250
Bullshit and I can take care of myself.

415
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,452
- I let you say goodbye.
- No need.

416
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,852
How'm I gonna know you're okay?

417
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,261
You're not.

418
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,855
Deal is, I give up my life,

419
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:56,663
my whole life, school, friends,
everything, everything.

420
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,260
And in return, you don't come see me,

421
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,465
don't call me, don't do anything.

422
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,803
Just stay away.

423
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:08,606
I screwed up,
keep screwing up, I know that,

424
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,407
but I don't know what else to do...

425
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,608
You can leave.

426
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,533
So I'm here, okay?

427
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:34,937
Whoever you are.
You come near me, I taser your ass.

428
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,051
So that makes two of us.

429
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:55,558
43, 47, 53, 59...

430
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:59,064
- I got you food.
- Call someone who gives.

431
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,873
I'd really like to explain.

432
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,674
Please come out.

433
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,175
Inviting.

434
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,086
What?

435
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,181
This time go to Barneys,
get Manolos or whatever

436
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,783
sick-expensive kind Sloan
and her bimbots loved.

437
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,887
Everything you say to me about her,
everything I see,

438
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:40,397
tells me she's not the kind.

439
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:41,398
Prada, then.

440
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:42,399
To be bought.

441
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,292
I'm not trying to buy her.

442
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,099
You are. And she'll hate that.

443
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:49,506
So what, then?

444
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,809
What do you know about her?

445
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,407
You must think about her.

446
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,210
Me know you see who she is.

447
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:01,945
Go on. Think.

448
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,153
It's like you don't even know me.

449
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,659
This whole thing is all kinds of mess.
It's just a bad scene.

450
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:18,168
There's nothing remotely good
and I miss everybody.

451
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:21,673
I miss being able to go out and
get deli coffee whenever I want.

452
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,672
And the clinic.

453
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,266
And everything that made me me.

454
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,868
No, it's way screwed up and

455
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,472
he thinks he can give me a few presents
and, like, that fixes everything.

456
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,985
I know it's just for a little while,
but I'm hating it.

457
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:39,484
I hate missing school, hate my dad,
just hate hating.

458
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,082
And I know it's life or death

459
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,789
but I've been saving for
that Machu Picchu trip for three years.

460
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,196
You know, the first thing
I did in my life just for me,

461
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,201
just because I wanted to.

462
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,303
Lindy-Lindy journeys to
a wonder of the world

463
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:56,603
and finally seizes her moment and--

464
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,943
Jesus, what's your problem?

465
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:03,140
What's with the mask?

466
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:04,443
I didn't want to freak you out.

467
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:07,451
Sure. The ski mask didn't freak me out.

468
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,346
I, uh, I-I got you Jujyfruits.

469
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,259
Can I ask you something?

470
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,262
Why am I here?

471
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,060
Because you need to be protected.

472
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,964
But I can take care of myself.

473
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,366
You don't even know me.

474
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:26,467
But my Dad and-and-and your Dad--

475
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:28,870
I know, his mysterious
"friend from the past."

476
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,068
He wanted someone
they couldn't trace you to.

477
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:34,271
He's scared out of his mind
something will happen to you.

478
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,876
Because of how much he loves you.

479
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:40,880
which he kept saying over and over.

480
00:43:42,855 --> 00:43:46,086
- Really?
- Yeah.

481
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:50,988
Thanks for the Jujyfruits.

482
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:52,687
You're welcome.

483
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:04,839
The thinking thing killed. Killed.

484
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:30,666
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

485
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:33,170
The real kind. Longhand.

486
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:36,173
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

487
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,670
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

488
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,576
Now, you're doing what?

489
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:45,879
Seeing if I can build a greenhouse.

490
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,782
She's very into roses.

491
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,677
Each color means
something different, you know?

492
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:52,986
Yeah. well, they all kind of mean,

493
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:57,495
I'm a guy who cries over chick flicks
and sleeps with stuffed animals.

494
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,032
I'm not here.

495
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,939
Hey. I'm Lindy.

496
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:17,243
Hi. will. A pleasure.

497
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:19,745
I, uh... heard the game.

498
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,752
- You a Rangers fan?
- Die-hard.

499
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,254
I knew it. Guys' gal.

500
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,351
Guys' gal.

501
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,055
- Why don't you join me?
- Thanks.

502
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,060
Sure.

503
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,264
What's with all the tools?

504
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,461
Uh, it's Hunter's thing.
It's a structure on the roof.

505
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:38,867
Structure for what?

506
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:42,974
You ever see the 1954
Devil Girl from Mars flick,

507
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:46,670
Where they abduct virginal
teenage girls for breeding stock?

508
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:53,182
I'm just-- It's a joke-joke. Sorry.

509
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,379
I haven't gotten out much.
I'm losing my social graces.

510
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:57,513
Rewind.

511
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,724
Hi. will. Pleasure.

512
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:06,423
The building books belong to Hunter,

513
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:10,628
an all-around, way-good guy
who's contemplating building

514
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,327
a greenhouse.

515
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:16,941
- A greenhouse?
- Yeah.

516
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:18,933
Rad.

517
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:22,845
Right?

518
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:23,934
Very funny.

519
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,645
So are we gonna, like, really meet?

520
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,453
- Like, now?
- No.

521
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:39,956
Okay.

522
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:47,564
You lived here your whole life?

523
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,558
No. Pretty recently.

524
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:52,562
I was living with my dad,

525
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:56,767
but he's the kinda guy
who can't really deal...

526
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:00,575
I wouldn't know anything about that.

527
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,406
And your mom?

528
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:10,319
Mine's dead. I never knew her.

529
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:15,219
So...no mom...Screwed-up dad.

530
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:17,628
It's too bad we have nothing in common.

531
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,930
What's with the Korean TV?

532
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:27,737
You speak Korean?

533
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,441
- Fluently.
- Oh, really?

534
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,738
What are they saying?

535
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,037
"Bon Appetit."

536
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:38,548
She didn't say "Bon Appetit."

537
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:40,551
Oh, you speak Korean too?

538
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,644
I don't like to show off, but yes.

539
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:45,053
And Koreans do not say Bon Appetit.

540
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:47,055
She said the Korean equivalent.

541
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,057
Which is what?

542
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,060
I hope you have a big appetite

543
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:54,258
such that you scarf food
and hurl chunks.

544
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,066
No that's the subjunctive.

545
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:58,659
I'll take Mom, you take Perm Boy.

546
00:48:58,737 --> 00:48:59,669
Game on.

547
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,506
So what's she saying now?

548
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:08,112
I love you, but when it comes to hair,
you are a clueless wonder

549
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,316
I can tell you for a fact
that is not what she said.

550
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,318
What Mom said was...

551
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:25,920
Hope will isn't your Korean teacher.

552
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,431
Do you, uh...do you miss school?

553
00:49:31,503 --> 00:49:33,334
Like a natural-born wonk.

554
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:37,339
Cause, uh...I have classes
if you want to come.

555
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:42,944
Yes. I'd love to

556
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:45,849
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.

557
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:50,649
Well, great.

558
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,656
I guess good night then.

559
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,057
Hold up.

560
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:17,579
Pretty gruesome, huh?

561
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:24,586
I've seen worse.

562
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,657
We're having school today,

563
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,757
but you need to make it
seem like we didn't just start

564
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,665
a-and I need to look smart.

565
00:51:12,938 --> 00:51:13,870
Lindy's coming.

566
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,975
Shut up. what're we studying?

567
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,876
Don't worry, I'll come up with
something graphic and humiliating.

568
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:22,573
No-No-No.
I need to know what it is now.

569
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,171
I need the answers in advance.

570
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,682
That's called cheating.

571
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,581
No, that's called trying
to get a girl to like you

572
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,984
while look like the lead
in a slasher flick.

573
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:33,087
- Shakespeare sonnet?
- Obvious.

574
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:34,887
- E.E. Cummings.
- Cliche.

575
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,191
What's cliche is the guy liking
school to impress the girl.

576
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,293
What about the Frank O'Hara poem
"Having a Coke with You"?

577
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,293
How do you know that poem?

578
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:45,598
I Googled
"modern poetry, impress girls."

579
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:49,406
But I need smart things to say.

580
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:51,301
Good luck with that.

581
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:55,908
I need another thinking thing.
Another thing Lindy'll like.

582
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:57,209
It's for this morning. Please don't ask.

583
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:58,909
When my husband wanted me to marry him,

584
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:00,315
he would weave me baskets.

585
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,751
Yeah, I really don't think
that's gonna work.

586
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,248
- What about chocolate?
- Oh, no.

587
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,255
Come on.

588
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,751
She will like it
when you are being kind.

589
00:52:09,928 --> 00:52:11,361
Yeah, I suck at that

590
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,056
When you are being yourself.

591
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,156
What, this self or the jerk I was?

592
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,162
The man I know you to be.

593
00:53:03,815 --> 00:53:05,146
How'd you do it?

594
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:08,545
I, uh, I just figured it out.

595
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,553
I love "Having a Coke with You."

596
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,359
- Shoot me now.
- What?

597
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:21,957
No, I mean, that's great,
that you know all about it

598
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,558
and will have
lots of smart things to say.

599
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:27,264
Blind man climbing.

600
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,673
- Could you just hang on a sec?
- Ow! Blind guy tripping.

601
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:34,876
- You're okay?
- Peachy.

602
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:36,072
Zola, thanks for getting these.

603
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:37,774
And by the way, I'm up the creek.

604
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,374
It turns out "Having a Coke with You"
is one of Lindy's favorites.

605
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:42,386
God, I'm looking forward to this class.

606
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,280
- Here you go.
- How'd you know?

607
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,382
Deli coffee, very underrated.

608
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,188
As I've always said.

609
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:54,891
Long-time green thumb?

610
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,000
No, no.

611
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,032
Actually my dad stuck me in this house

612
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,438
so no one could see me.

613
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:06,443
And I thought I'd take the, the ugly and

614
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,843
shameful thing and
turn it into something not.

615
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:19,046
Of course, not everyone
can necessarily see its beauty...

616
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:21,058
Just read.

617
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:30,565
Having a Coke with You

618
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,970
is even more fun than
going to San Sebastian,

619
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:42,169
lrun, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne

620
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:43,578
or being sick to my stomach

621
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:47,084
on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona

622
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:50,186
partly because in your orange shirt

623
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:53,588
you look like a better
happier St. Sebastian

624
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,083
partly because of my love for you.

625
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,732
We be back.

626
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,737
We-- Oh, yeah, we be back. we be back.

627
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:08,737
Carry on.

628
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,751
in the warm New York 4 o'clock light

629
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,448
we are drifting back and forth
between each other

630
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:29,152
like a tree breathing
through its spectacles

631
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:42,563
and the portrait show
seems to have no faces in it at all,

632
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:44,568
just paint

633
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,970
you suddenly wonder
why in the world anyone ever did them

634
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,680
I look at you
and I would rather look at you than

635
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,684
all the portraits in the world

636
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,137
I need more time.

637
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:26,040
Magic can't be undone.

638
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:27,345
But I might have a shot
if I had more time.

639
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,045
Can't, sorry.

640
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,651
Okay. I pissed you off. You wasted me.

641
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:34,749
But there's got to be something
you can do.

642
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,054
Come on, help me.

643
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:37,856
I can't. And I wouldn't.

644
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:40,056
You still don't think about
anyone but yourself.

645
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:45,468
You're wrong.
I do think about other people.

646
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:47,265
I think about Lindy
and what her life is like

647
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:48,771
and I think about
a woman who can't see her kids

648
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,273
and a man who can't see, period.

649
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,370
So he cares now?

650
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:59,581
Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,712
Okay, I'll keep trying with Lindy.

652
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:06,917
But please give will his sight,
Zola her family.

653
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:08,916
It's the least they deserve

654
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,722
after being trapped
in this hell with me.

655
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:14,526
I'll help them. If you succeed.

656
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:22,831
And Kyle, good luck.

657
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,247
- I got your CDs.
- Thanks.

658
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:53,260
Just some guy at my old school.

659
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,663
- Kind of a jerk, actually.
- Really?

660
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,674
Yeah, we were
on this committee together,

661
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:59,767
so that's why I have his picture.

662
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,409
I mean... Looks-wise, he doesn't suck.

663
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,108
Oh! He knew it, too.

664
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:07,312
Same old, same old:

665
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:09,012
jerks are exciting
and my type falls for 'em.

666
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:11,920
- Did you fall for him?
- Not that I fell for him.

667
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,026
Every once in a while,
you kind of remind me of him.

668
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,820
Not that you're a jerk.

669
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:26,436
Anyways, he disappeared. Rehab.

670
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:31,739
Oh, it figures. The addict's daughter
falls for the addict.

671
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,436
So you did fall for him?

672
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,538
No, I mean, I just talked to him
his last night.

673
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,741
For, like, a minute.

674
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,446
You konow, the truly
ridiculous thing is,

675
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,146
I might have, kind of, sort of,

676
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:47,555
actually thought he,
a little bit, liked me...ish.

677
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:49,058
Of course he did.

678
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:50,059
Oh, please.

679
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:54,360
He was completely on the in
and I was not, am not.

680
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:55,660
That's why I like you.

681
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,700
Yeah, well...same.

682
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:05,106
Anyways, being on the in isn't all that.

683
00:59:05,176 --> 00:59:08,111
Isn't that what people on the out
say to make each other feel better?

684
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:12,415
Yeah. But it also happens to be true.

685
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:16,710
Something about him...

686
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:18,520
What?

687
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,917
Underneath all the bullshit was...
I don't know.

688
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:24,919
What?

689
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,229
Good.

690
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:28,923
Good?

691
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,530
So, I mean, are you still into him?

692
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:38,334
Like you said, you don't want to be
the girl who falls forjerks.

693
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,138
Yeah. But he-he's not.

694
00:59:40,211 --> 00:59:42,441
Right. He's a decent guy at heart.

695
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:43,844
That's what I'm thinking.

696
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,645
But still kinda...wrong.

697
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:48,350
Yeah.

698
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,145
I don't know.

699
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:56,556
You know, that something underneath,
it's catnip for sappy tools like me.

700
00:59:58,229 --> 00:59:59,958
To be the one who uncovers it.

701
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,867
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

702
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:25,481
Usually, if I'm out this time of night,

703
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm looking for my dad,

704
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,783
mace in hand, counting by primes.

705
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:30,793
Counting?

706
01:00:30,862 --> 01:00:32,693
It keeps me from getting scared.

707
01:00:34,165 --> 01:00:39,102
Oh. Fortunately,
scary guy's right next to you.

708
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:41,202
So there's that.

709
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,301
What about when people see you?

710
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:48,008
They don't. I got it down.

711
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,713
I was good at blending in too.

712
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:55,115
This way.

713
01:00:57,188 --> 01:00:58,917
You taking me to the park?

714
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,754
You'll see. Come on.

715
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:05,753
The zoo?

716
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:10,566
Hear that?

717
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:16,170
The animals. water lapping.

718
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,070
In some nearby street,
a man is whispering...

719
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,370
"I love you."

720
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,284
Do you hear that?

721
01:01:32,657 --> 01:01:33,487
What?

722
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:36,288
Somewhere there's a baboon
scratching his ass.

723
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,216
Why are we here?

724
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,650
This place is important to me.

725
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,266
It's still here.

726
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:26,869
What is it?

727
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,872
When I was in kindergarten,

728
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,182
my dad offered to take me
anywhere I wanted.

729
01:02:34,452 --> 01:02:35,783
We came to the zoo.

730
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:40,183
He bought me
all the toys and candy I wanted.

731
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,284
And at the end of the day,
he told me my mother had left.

732
01:02:47,665 --> 01:02:49,098
I haven't seen her since.

733
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,304
After he told me,
I ran away and hid in here.

734
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,106
And saw this movie.

735
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:08,349
It's about this mother elephant
whose two babies die.

736
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:10,750
Plague or something.

737
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:16,850
She misses them so much

738
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,657
that when she's migrating back
a year later--

739
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:27,359
a year later--
she finds her babies' bones.

740
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:34,172
Can you imagine that love?

741
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:37,980
No.

742
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:49,492
I never brought anyone here before.

743
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:14,044
Seven, eight, nine...

744
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:21,053
ten, eleven, twelve...

745
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:25,853
It feels like I've known you forever.

746
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:35,870
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

747
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,571
The sun's coming up.

748
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:50,881
I think...

749
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:55,386
I think I love you.

750
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,779
Maybe I should let her go.

751
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,120
At least she'll be safe in Machu Picchu.

752
01:06:02,193 --> 01:06:04,718
She has been jonesing
for that trip forever,

753
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,228
even without being stuck here.

754
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:09,323
But every day,
she like you more and more.

755
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,731
But not the way I like her.

756
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:13,427
- Move your hands. My turn.
- Sorry.

757
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,738
I don't stand a chance.

758
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:18,934
She's still talking about
running away. And...

759
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:24,137
I-I know you guys want out, too.

760
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:26,039
- Desperately.
- No.

761
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:28,146
Kidding. Kidding.

762
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,153
Look, even if she does go on the trip,

763
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:33,349
you still have a couple days
to ratchet up the romance quotient.

764
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:36,359
Just try to put yourself in her shoes.

765
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:38,554
This is all so strange for her,

766
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:41,860
but me know she'll say
those words, "I love you."

767
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:44,858
It's just the year is almost up.

768
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:49,765
Just take her to whatever
bad-boy country house Daddy's got.

769
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,068
Daddy don't got.

770
01:06:54,245 --> 01:06:55,371
Just the lake cottage.

771
01:06:56,747 --> 01:06:59,375
Just the--

772
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,715
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Would you buy a frickin' vowel? Go!

773
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,030
seriously?

774
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,334
After you.

775
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:40,850
So, are you, uh, dying of boredom yet?

776
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,551
No.

777
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:49,650
It must have been so great
as a kid coming out here.

778
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:53,155
My dad got bad reception down
at the lake.

779
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:56,765
He could only take it
for about forty-five minutes.

780
01:08:57,935 --> 01:09:01,894
But those forty-five minutes...
they were awesome.

781
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:11,505
My Dad was a teacher.
You know, before my mom died and

782
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:14,116
he lost it.

783
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:15,609
Do you miss your dad?

784
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:17,711
Not right now.

785
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:23,417
In the past few months,
living away from my dad...

786
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:27,931
not spending every second
worrying about him,

787
01:09:28,499 --> 01:09:31,024
I mean, not trying to
fix everything for him,

788
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:34,434
Just not totally losing myself.

789
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:38,136
That's why I wanted to go away
on that trip in the first place.

790
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:42,845
I guess this cage set me free.

791
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,644
Is that a "thank you"?

792
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:51,547
- Let's go down to the lake.
- Okay.

793
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:14,773
I've been writing something for you.

794
01:10:15,446 --> 01:10:17,778
- What is it?
- A letter.

795
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:40,496
I'm sorry. This-This ring is only--

796
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:42,303
Hello?

797
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:46,105
Which hospital?

798
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:48,303
Okay. I'll--I'll--I'll call you back.

799
01:10:53,784 --> 01:10:55,308
My father OD'd.

800
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:00,417
You have to go to him.

801
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:14,861
All aboard!

802
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:28,977
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go!

803
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:30,280
- I'll call you.
- He's gonna be fine.

804
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:32,788
Okay. I'll call you. And as soon as
he's better, I'll come back.

805
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,288
And everything will be all right.

806
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,584
And Hunter...

807
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:39,494
Yeah?

808
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,294
You're a good friend.

809
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:07,747
Don't. Don't read that.

810
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:11,952
Don't read that. Don't read that.

811
01:12:16,934 --> 01:12:21,268
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

812
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:24,072
The real kind. Longhand.

813
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:27,167
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

814
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:30,777
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

815
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:36,479
And I'm going to write to you
every day for a long, long, long time

816
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:43,183
because I think-
I think I might be in danger of...

817
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,091
falling in love with you.

818
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:59,205
Hey, it's me.
Uh, my dad is gonna be okay, but

819
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:02,841
I really want to talk to you
about your letter.

820
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:04,746
Where are you?

821
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:07,643
Look, I don't understand.

822
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:09,151
You wrote me this letter.

823
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:10,743
Why don't you call me back?

824
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:12,754
Because I'm "a good friend."

825
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:14,850
What's going on?

826
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:18,194
Hunter...

827
01:13:36,046 --> 01:13:37,377
I'm out of time.

828
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:38,277
Call her back.

829
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:39,872
Why, because I'm "a good friend?"

830
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:40,882
Yup.

831
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:43,476
And not calling her back,
what good that do, huh?

832
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:47,487
She even called me.
Why won't you talk to her?

833
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:51,493
The last time I talked to her,
she told me she's hurt.

834
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,497
And "hurt" is girl-speak for,
"Call now, bonehead."

835
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:58,195
She don't know what to do,

836
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,702
so she go back to school
to go on the trip.

837
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:43,177
Lindy!

838
01:14:51,455 --> 01:14:52,479
What're you doing here?

839
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:54,483
I had to see you before you left.

840
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:55,991
- You wrote me that letter.
- I know.

841
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:58,493
- And then you didn't call me back.
- I'm sorry.

842
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:00,291
You knew what was going on with me.

843
01:15:00,364 --> 01:15:01,695
I was being dumb.

844
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,824
- I just was scared you didn't--
- Didn't what?

845
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,026
Love me.

846
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:12,534
And I didn't think you could.
Because of how ugly I am.

847
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:20,950
And I should have known better,
that that's not who you are.

848
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:29,258
You took one look at me
and still said you'd seen worse.

849
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:36,361
Somehow...when I'm around you...

850
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,266
I don't feel ugly at all.

851
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,770
It's because you're not.

852
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:32,954
Go.

853
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:34,649
You deserve it.

854
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:47,862
Nothing's gonna change
while you're gone.

855
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,366
That I can promise.

856
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:06,020
Go.

857
01:17:12,596 --> 01:17:13,528
Go.

858
01:17:23,507 --> 01:17:24,439
Hunter.

859
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:30,138
I love you.

860
01:18:05,282 --> 01:18:06,408
Kyle.

861
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,651
Hunter!

862
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,153
Kyle!

863
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:49,548
Sorry, I'm looking for someone,
I don't mean to be rude.

864
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:50,752
- I get it.
- Thanks.

865
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,260
And sometime, you'll tell me
what happened to you.

866
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:54,058
- I-I met someone.
- That's great.

867
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,757
She reminds me of you.

868
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:58,060
And she showed me
that love can change you.

869
01:18:58,134 --> 01:18:59,260
Do you think love change you?

870
01:18:59,336 --> 01:19:00,268
Of course.

871
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:01,899
Then you'll believe the story
I'm about to tell you.

872
01:19:01,972 --> 01:19:02,904
Where is he?

873
01:19:02,973 --> 01:19:07,000
It's about a guy, good-looking
on the outside, ugly on the inside.

874
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,910
And there's a curse.
Love-Love changes him.

875
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,413
Everyone knows that story.

876
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,010
What if it wasn't a story?
What if it were true?

877
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,018
What?

878
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:56,559
Can you imagine...that love?

879
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:03,965
Can you?

880
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:11,872
Yeah.

881
01:20:27,357 --> 01:20:28,381
It's you.

882
01:20:58,188 --> 01:21:01,021
Wake up. Wake up.

883
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:07,354
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

884
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,060
It's a dream, right?

885
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:16,769
It's must be.

886
01:21:19,342 --> 01:21:20,570
But happy.

887
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:23,879
Very damn happy.

888
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:30,681
Mr. Kingson, your new intern
is coming up in the elevator,

889
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:32,278
I thought you might want to meet her.

890
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:33,879
Just so long as she's easy on the eyes.

891
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:36,187
Well she's a bit odd looking.

892
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:37,886
No dogfaces, no dumpy frumps.

893
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:40,486
But her reference said
no matter what you throw her way,

894
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,690
she can always work magic.

895
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:55,720
