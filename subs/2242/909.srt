00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,894
Hayes.

164
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,973
(CHUCKLING) You wanted to be President?

165
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,437
I'm just, I don't understand why you have to work for Clinton in New York.

166
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,379
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?

167
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,508
Well, because they don't need me here. They need me in New York.

168
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:18,884
They need him, Em. Will's the man. I can't believe you're letting him go.

169
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,855
I mean, don't you know about New York girls?

170
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,290
Besides being incredibly hot, they have no problem with casual sex,

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,453
which by the way, I totally respect.

172
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,793
-What if Charlie¡¯s right? -Charlie¡¯s never right.

173
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,823
-He's functionally retarded. -I am worried New York's gonna change you.

174
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:33,927
-Change can be good. -If we change together.

175
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,700
So, we'll change together.

176
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:39,640
Okay? It's two months in New York. I'll be back before you know it.

177
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,234
Besides, we have a plan, right?

178
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,576
The other thing I can't believe is that you'd risk Ieaving Emily here with me,

179
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:48,675
'cause I gotta tell you, I've always had a thing for you...

180
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,820
And I have absolutely no scruples.

181
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,852
Wait! I almost forgot. You have to give this to Summer.

182
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:59,188
She's the only girl I know in New York.

183
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,524
-I want you to meet her. -Summer Hartley?

184
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,723
-Yes. Yes. -That's her name?

185
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,527
She was on my exchange program at Cambridge,

186
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,899
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her, and you probably will, too.

187
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,130
Maybe you should mail it to her.

188
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:09,365
-That might be a better idea. -No.

189
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,428
What is it?

190
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,840
Something I should have sent her a long time ago.

191
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:17,039
I love you, William Hayes.

192
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,551
(CAR HORN HONKING)

193
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:22,043
Okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.

194
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,720
Emily sounds like she would make a good mom.

195
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:28,587
-I just don't know if she's my mom. - Why not?

196
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,955
Everyone knows that the girlfriend

197
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,927
in the beginning of the story always gets dumped.

198
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:36,261
Which means maybe Summer Hartley is my mother.

199
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:54,811
I'll never forget that day.

200
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,685
There I was, arriving in the city I always dreamed about

201
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,883
to work on a campaign that I believed in with all of my heart.

202
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,450
And on top of that, I was positive that in just a few hours,

203
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:08,498
the campaign manager would realize how brilliant I was.

204
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,055
And then I'd be writing speeches,

205
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,260
and then I'd be coming up with strategy, and before long...

206
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:13,700
GARETH: Will Hayes?

207
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,635
-Hey. Gareth Henderson. -You're Gareth.

208
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,173
-Hey, how are you? -Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.

209
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:22,507
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

210
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,538
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these in my abundant spare time.

211
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,710
In the meantime, here's a sample of the coffee and bagel order

212
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,549
I'll need filled immediately.

213
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,179
Wait!

214
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,553
You want me to get coffee?

215
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:37,525
At some point in our lives, we all get coffee. Your time's now. Come on.

216
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:38,822
We're still walking, Hayes.

217
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,557
Have the coffee here by 10:00, or Arthur's gonna kill me!

218
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,600
That means I'm gonna have to kill you. I've killed before, Hayes.

219
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:47,660
-You should know that. -What is this?

220
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:49,329
That is a cellular telephone

221
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,705
so I can get a hold of you wherever, whenever, for whatever.

222
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,802
-Can somebody get me an aspirin, please? -Watch it!

223
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,040
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!

224
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,376
-Hi. -What? Hi.

225
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:06,354
ARTHUR: Four weeks from now, voters of New York State

226
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,086
will select their next Democratic nominee for President.

227
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,420
Now, if Bill Clinton wins,

228
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,898
I want you to all understand that it's gonna be as a direct result

229
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,925
of the commitment and the energy of every person in this room.

230
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,405
And I mean that. That's just a fact.

231
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:25,566
Now, that's how important the work is.

232
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:28,634
That each and every one of you is...

233
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,640
(WILLIAM SCREAMS)

234
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,808
(CRASHING)

235
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,872
(SHOUTING) What am I doing here?

236
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:35,945
It's the new guy.

237
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,919
-Hey. -Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?

238
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:48,593
-Can I get a pack of Morley Red, please? -3.25.

239
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,858
3.25? These are $2.15 in Madison, Wisconsin.

240
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,301
So go back to Madison.

241
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,931
-Don't forget to write. -That's right. Don't forget to write.

242
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,305
Hold it! Stop. Stop right there!

243
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,075
You smoked?

244
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,839
No. Yeah.

245
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,549
But I didn't mean to tell you that.

246
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:12,378
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid, and I haven't smoked in years.

247
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:13,581
I promise you.

248
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,854
Is there anything else you should tell me?

249
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,327
Probably not.

250
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,770
-Can I get 10 copies? -Put them on the pile.

251
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:30,305
No, they're for Arthur. I need them like, 15 minutes ago.

252
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,500
So if you wouldn¡¯t mind...

253
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,400
You're the toilet paper guy.

254
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:37,935
Wait. Who's that?  That's April.

255
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,774
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy,

256
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,842
but feel free to call me the bagel-and-coffee guy.

257
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,755
Or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal, which I'm pretty sure is a girl¡¯s name.

258
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,851
-How many copies? -Ten. Please.

259
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:54,260
-These? -Yeah, both of those.

260
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,523
What made you become a Bill Clinton supporter?

261
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,228
I'm not. This is a money gig. I get paid 12 an hour,

262
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:04,603
which is better than babysitting, which is what I've been doing way too much of.

263
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:06,141
You're a Democrat, right?

264
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,610
Why does everyone have to be a Democrat or a Republican?

265
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,941
I'm struggling with the copy machine.

266
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:13,278
No, hold on. You're an Independent, aren't you?

267
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,683
I am nothing. Why am I obligated to be something?

268
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,984
Why do I have to have an opinion about everything anyway?

269
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,081
I mean, really, what do I know about missile systems

270
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,388
or Social Security, or the tax code?

271
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:27,624
What about civil rights or women's rights?

272
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,995
A woman's right to do what she wants with her body? What about that?

273
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,557
I do what I want with my body.

274
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:35,001
That's apathetic.

275
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,766
-I'm not apathetic. -Yes, you are.

276
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,207
I'm not. I just know that these bozos you're working for,

277
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:42,335
they don't care about anything more than their own ambitions.

278
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:43,401
That's absolutely not true.

279
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,005
You think this guy, Bill Clinton, is gonna make a huge difference?

280
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,073
-I do. -He's gonna do what's already inevitable.

281
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,415
-Okay, that's where you're wrong. -Don't make me staple your head!

282
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,751
You're wrong. He's gonna make a difference with African Americans.

283
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:54,551
He's gonna make a difference with women. He gets women.

284
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,615
-My God. -I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.

285
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:59,124
Read his plans on health care. Read his plans on education.

286
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,724
-Okay, or don't. You know, yeah. -Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

287
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,094
-Yeah, I'm sorry. -I just fell asleep.

288
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,393
-I'm really sorry. -Yeah. That's fine.

289
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,865
Wake up to a new America.

290
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,526
-I believe you. -This has been really interesting.

291
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:10,004
-Fine. You convinced me. You're nothing. -I'm nothing.

Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!

294
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:15,804


295
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,245
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.

296
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,508
Hey, somebody turn it up.

297
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:23,484
For the past two years, I have lied to the press about our relationship to protect him.

298
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:25,851
The truth is, I loved him.

299
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,653
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

300
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,850
Now he tells me to deny it.

301
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:35,956
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit, and I'm sick of all of the lies.

302
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,995
Well, you're right about one thing. He certainly gets women.

303
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:44,199
-This has been fun. Yeah. -(LAUGHING) Bye, toilet paper guy.

304
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,866
Bye, copy girl.

305
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,200
Oh, my God. It never ends.

306
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,178
They just keep playing it over and over and over again.

307
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,577
- It's gonna bIow over. -Right.

308
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:52,876
PeopIe don't really care about this stuff.

309
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,883
-That's the thing. -What I don't understand,

310
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,249
I've heard Bush has a mistress.

311
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,619
Everybody's talking about it, so why is it okay for him and not for Clinton?

312
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,385
She's trashy.

313
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,724
I mean, her hair alone is enough reason to go after Clinton.

314
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:08,025
Big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses, you know?

315
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:11,067

00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:23,782
You're beautiful. You're sophisticated. You're a very talented writer.

476
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:24,877
Thank you.

477
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:27,286
I mean, to please a woman like you, it would obviously take a...

478
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:29,085
-Real man. -Exactly.

479
00:26:29,158 --> 00:26:33,356
-Hard to compete with that. -Well, unless you're the competitive type.

480
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:39,067
-Yep, nice to meet you. -Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.

481
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:42,097
I feel horrible about taking the...

482
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,342
Sorry.

483
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,984
I was just curious.

484
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:03,021
Hampton encourages me to cultivate my curiosity.

485
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:07,087
He says it's the key to being a good journalist.

486
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:08,927
Yeah.

487
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:12,024
HAMPTON: Summer! Daddy's hungry!

488
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:15,693
-Speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah. -Hmm.

489
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:16,829
HAMPTON: Where the hell are you?

490
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,874
-Okay, bye. -Bye.

491
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:22,399
Yeah, give us a call sometime. We should all go out for dinner.

492
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:24,241
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.

493
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,746
-Yeah. -HAMPTON: Hey!

494
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,709
-Are you gonna call her? -Are you insane?

495
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:34,119
-Well, what are you gonna do? -What am I gonna do?

496

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

497
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,684
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball. Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.

498
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,661
Which may involve some type of threesome now.

499
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,392
Or foursome if that old dude is still in the picture.

500
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,434
You're not helping.

501
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:50,764
I never should have opened that diary. It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.

502
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:53,005
What's a threesome?

503
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:55,043
-What? A threesome.

504
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:01,340
That's a game that adults play sometimes when they're bored.

505
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,087
Whatever. So what happened with Emily?

506
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:09,681
Nothing. I wanted to wait till she came for a visit,

507
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,592
and then I decided to do something really dramatic.

508
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,923
It was just one week before the primary, and I had graduated

509
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:21,459
from bagels and toilet paper to signs and bumper stickers.

510

(SCREAMS)

511
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:26,264
Jesus! Mercy!

512
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,969
Hold, please.

513
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,702
What am I doing here?

514
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:39,045
Move over! Another foot! Go, another foot. Move over!

515
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:41,282
Over, over, over!

516
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:49,426
Just want to let everyone know that the new signs are ready.

517
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:51,227
They're looking good.

518
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,633
I wrote three speeches for Congressman Sweeney.

How's high school?

521
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:59,974
He's from Texas. His name's George Bush. But he is not the President.

522
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,101
Instead, he's the eldest son of George and Barbara

523
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:04,544
and considered a key political advisor of the White House.

524
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,547
Bryant, well, you forgot to mention the Texas Rangers.

525
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:07,639
BRYANT: Oh, okay.

526
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:09,581
Man, if this guy's smart, he'll go back to baseball.

527
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:11,119
-No kidding. -Anybody see Hayes?

528
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:12,176
-No. -No.

529
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:16,148
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!

530
00:29:16,692 --> 00:29:19,593
Is it true you graduated first of your class at Madison?

531
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:21,391
-Yeah. -All right.

532
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:23,294
-Come on. We're walking. -We're walking.

533
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:25,424
Here's a list of Madison graduates in the New York area.

534
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,332
These people earn 200 grand plus a year.

535
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:30,861
We have a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser on Monday with 15 empty tables.

536
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,408
I can't have that, Hayes. I need you to sell five of them.

537
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:35,067
Hold on. No more coffee, bagels?

538
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:37,135
-We'll see how this goes, okay? -Gareth.

-What? -Thank you. I'm really happy right now.

-Okay, Hayes. -Okay.

541
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:46,812
-There's the desk. -Look at that. Yeah.

542
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,185
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.

543
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:52,750
That's good because it's ironic.

544
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:55,729
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.

545
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,696
Right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.

546
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,998
And I have a phone. And this empty basket.

547
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,436
No, no, no, I really don't agree

548
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:07,032
that the Governor has a character problem, Mrs. Perleman.

549
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,407
Did you know that 50% of Americans believe that

550
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:12,242
marijuana use should be legalized?

No, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.

Besides, did you know that the majority of Americans believe

555
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:22,582
that the Vietnam War was just a terrible idea?

(PHONE LINE DRONES)

00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:34,835
Yes, I understand your concern, but I think you should remember

560
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:39,873
that the Governor comes from a town called Hope.

561
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:44,042
And hope is exactly what he stands for, so...

562
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:47,774
No, no, I know it's corny, but I also think

563
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,786
that sometimes corny is exactly what this country needs.

That would be wonderful. No, thank you.

Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning

she said that she wanted to get to know our most important supporters.

No, I think you'd definitely enjoy meeting her.

Yeah.

572
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:21,374
An entire table? No, that is very possible.

573
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,546
I'll put you down for one table, then. That sounds great.

-Did that Clinton inhale or not? -What does it matter?

591
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:24,271
4.25? You pay $4.25 for a pack of cigarettes?

592
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,280
They don't put as many chemicals in them.

593
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:29,078
-So those are healthy cigarettes. -Something like that.

594
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:31,210
So if there's not as many chemicals in them,

595
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:34,380
they should cost less, not more, don't you think?

596
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:37,152
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,

597
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:40,684
which make them burn faster, which make you smoke more.

598
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:46,325
Which means, at the end of the day, your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.

599
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:51,535
Copy girl, what I think you're actually paying for

600
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,667
is the picture of the eagle and the pretty pastel colors.

-It's amazing how you do that. -What?

643
00:35:23,692 --> 00:35:25,284
The way you take the simplest statement,

644
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,591
and then you twist it with a completely negative connotation.

No, I'm not getting down on my knee.

And why should I marry you, anyway? I mean, why do you wanna marry me?

Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill an ideal that society embeds in us

Seriously, why?

708

For my 13th birthday, I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,

709
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:53,529
and instead my dad bought me a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.

710
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:57,868
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription, which I could care less about at the time

711
00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,669
seeing as I was so pissed about the earrings,

712
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:05,645
which was tragic as it turned out 'cause it was the last present he ever gave me.

I read it every year or two. Each time it's different.

719
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:24,862
It tells me different things.

720
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:30,770
Anyhow, when I went away to college, my mom sold our house

721
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,672
and somewhere along the way, Jane Eyre got lost.

01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:37,792
That's...

1259
01:08:38,236 --> 01:08:40,329
When people read this...

1260
01:08:42,674 --> 01:08:44,972
Summer, listen to me.

1261
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:48,103
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.

1262
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,842
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week, and then the storm will pass...

1263
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:53,146
I'm talking about you and me.

01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,850
-Come on. -I'm just doing my job.

1266
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,485
I didn't do it the first time around.

1267
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:08,021
And if I didn't write this, somebody else would.

1268
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:10,659
Let them.

1269
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:13,135
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?

1270
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,742
You already did.

1271
01:09:36,828 --> 01:09:38,591
Mr. Arthur...

1272
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,383
(CHATTERING)

1273
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:41,022
ARTHUR: Yeah, sure.

1274
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,190
I really liked Summer.

1275
01:09:43,268 --> 01:09:45,133
I can't believe she turned out to be such a...

1276
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:46,397
-Heartbreaker? -No.

1277
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:48,769
-Opportunist? Double-crossing... -Uh-uh.

1278
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,740
-Bitch. -Maya.

1279
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:52,674
How could she do that to you?

1280
01:09:52,744 --> 01:09:56,339
It's like she said. If she didn't write it, someone else would have.

1281
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:57,938
And it was the truth.

1282
01:09:58,016 --> 01:10:00,348
So did she? Did she break it?

1283
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:02,045
What?

1284
01:10:07,826 --> 01:10:09,657
What happened when the article came out?

1285
01:10:09,728 --> 01:10:13,425


1286
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:29,507
You screwed up, man. You really screwed up.

1287
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:31,276
Please save it. I don't need to hear this right now.

1288
01:10:31,349 --> 01:10:33,613
Whenever I figure out whatever I'm supposed to learn from all this,

1289
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:36,017
-I'll write you a letter! -Yeah, can't wait.

1290
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:41,218
So I lost my girl, I lost my job, and I lost my friend.

1291
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,891
And for a long time, nothing seemed to matter.

1292
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:48,929
But I wasn't the only one with problems.

1293
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,835
I did not have sexual relations with that woman,

1294
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:55,463
Miss Lewinsky.

1295
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,565
I never told anybody to lie.

1296
01:10:57,642 --> 01:10:59,337
-Hello? -Are you watching?

1297
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,538
These allegations are false.

1298
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:02,671
April?

1299
01:11:02,747 --> 01:11:06,706
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was? Are you watching or not?

1300
01:11:06,785 --> 01:11:08,616
Of course I'm watching.

1301
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:11,221
You think he did it, don't you?

1302
01:11:11,289 --> 01:11:15,919
I don't think, I know. Look at the picture of her. I love her.

1303
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:17,894
She's so his type.

1304
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:22,990
So, what took you so long to finally call me back there, red?

1305
01:11:23,068 --> 01:11:24,763
I thought I lost you.

1306
01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:28,829
-Feels like years. -I'm calling you now, aren't I?

1307
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:31,464
Yeah.

1308
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:33,906
How are you? What's doing?

1309
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,208
I got a new roommate, Olivia.

1310
01:11:37,282 --> 01:11:38,647
And I'm working at a bookstore.

1311
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:39,706


1312
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:42,182
But I've been thinking about going back to school.

1313
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:43,481
Cool.

1314
01:11:43,555 --> 01:11:45,284
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?

1315
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:47,848
I used to love what I do, and now I feel like a complete hack.

1316
01:11:47,926 --> 01:11:49,416


1317
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,809
-Are you seeing anyone? -Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.

1318
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,812
In fact, I haven't had sex since Clinton was re-elected.

1319
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,898
Why bother? He's having enough sex for the entire country.

1320
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:01,995
Easy. Easy now.

1321
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,372
Hey, maybe you should follow his lead and seduce an intern.

1322
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:07,741
You know, it's funny that you should mention that.

1323
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:11,714
There's a fetching young intern who just started a week ago.

1324
01:12:11,783 --> 01:12:13,751
Great. Ask her out.

1325
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:16,287
I should, shouldn't I?

1326
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:20,990
But I don't think I will. You see, I don't want a fling.

1327
01:12:21,059 --> 01:12:23,118
I want the real deal.

1328
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:26,459
Forget about the real deal. You don't find it, it finds you.

1329
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:29,659
What does that mean? I don't know what that means.

1330
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:32,965
It means that you get to a certain age and then you're ready.

1331
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:36,302
You know, you're ready for kids or a commitment or, you know...

1332
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:37,773
-Sir. -...a mortgage.

1333
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:39,867
-Table¡¯s ready. Okay. -Thanks.

1334
01:12:39,944 --> 01:12:41,002
You know what I mean?

1335
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:44,207
And the person that you're with then, they become the one.

1336
01:12:44,282 --> 01:12:47,046
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.

1337
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:48,847
-Exactly. -Okay. All right.

1338
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,981
So there's never been a guy, ever, that made you think, "This is it.

1339
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:55,457
"This is him. This is the one."

1340

No.

I am.

01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,698
-You are? -Yes.

1344
01:13:04,469 --> 01:13:06,767
Right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.

-Kevin. -Kevin.

1346
01:13:09,073 --> 01:13:10,370
Who the hell's Kevin?

1347
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:13,775
Where did... How come you never, you know, mentioned anything about him?

1348
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:15,813
I'm mentioning him now.

1349
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:19,708
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea. I love fresh mint tea.

I love beer.

1351
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:25,883
It depends upon what the meaning of the word "is" is.

1352
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:31,088
If it means "there is none" that is a completely true statement.

Okay.

...you know, you could be a prime candidate for that.

It is complicated, isn't it?

I mean, you're in love with April, who used to be in love with Lucas,

1464
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:32,174
and then she fell in love with you, but you were in love with Summer,

who was always really in love with Hampton.

Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.

It's a beautiful edition, known for the cover illustration.

I meant to...

1731
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:17,491
I meant to give it to you. I wanted to give it to you.

1732
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:19,194
I just...

1733
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:22,538
I couldn¡¯t. And I don't know why.

1734
01:40:23,873 --> 01:40:27,900
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried. Kevin was there and...

1735
01:40:27,977 --> 01:40:31,606
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.

1736
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:34,644
It's inexcusable.

1737
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:41,651
-I think you should go, Will. -April?

1738
01:40:42,826 --> 01:40:44,726
I think you should go.

1739
01:40:59,042 --> 01:41:02,341
You never gave it to her? After all that time?

1740
01:41:02,412 --> 01:41:04,346
- I know. I know. -But it was from her dad.

1741
01:41:04,414 --> 01:41:06,644
I know. I know.

1742
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:08,741
And then you just left?

1743
01:41:09,752 --> 01:41:11,310
Yep.

1744
01:41:12,589 --> 01:41:15,786
How come you changed all the names except hers?

1745
01:41:15,859 --> 01:41:16,985
What do you mean?

1746
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:19,927
In the story, you know, like Mom became Emily,

1747
01:41:19,996 --> 01:41:23,727
and Summer's that Natasha lady who writes for that magazine.

1748
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,564
But you didn't change April¡¯s name. Why?

1749
01:41:29,506 --> 01:41:33,602
Why are you so concerned with all of this anyway?

1750
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:36,142
Because I want you to be happy.

1751
01:41:36,446 --> 01:41:38,073
You know,

1752
01:41:38,848 --> 01:41:40,509
I'm happy.

1753
01:41:41,484 --> 01:41:44,009
Trust me, Dad. You're not happy.

1754
01:41:57,834 --> 01:41:59,495
Put your coat on.

1755
01:42:04,841 --> 01:42:06,809
-Taxi! -Taxi!

1756
01:42:13,149 --> 01:42:14,946
She said something was missing with Kevin,

1757
01:42:15,018 --> 01:42:17,646
which means it might not be missing with you,

1758
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,484
-which is good news, right? -CouId be.

1759
01:42:21,457 --> 01:42:23,084
CouId be.

1760
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:28,094
Did you know that 35 people try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?

1761
01:42:28,164 --> 01:42:30,394
Most because of broken hearts.

1762
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:33,064
I'll keep that in mind.

1763
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:47,828
(BUZZING)

1764
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,946
- Hello. -Hey. Hi.

1765
01:42:54,123 --> 01:42:55,886
It's me, Will.

1766

(GASPS)

1767
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,187
April?

1768
01:43:05,034 --> 01:43:06,865
What are you doing here?

1769
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,307
Uh...

1770
01:43:09,339 --> 01:43:11,102
Go on, tell her.

1771
01:43:12,108 --> 01:43:13,632
Who's that?

1772
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:16,804
That would be my daughter, Maya.

1773
01:43:16,879 --> 01:43:19,177
That's kind of cheating, isn't it? Bringing your daughter?

1774
01:43:19,249 --> 01:43:21,217
What am I supposed to do now?

1775
01:43:22,518 --> 01:43:24,509
Well, you could let us in.

1776
01:43:27,423 --> 01:43:30,085
I don't think she's gonna let us in.

1777
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:31,913
(EXHALES)

1778
01:43:32,028 --> 01:43:33,928
I think you're wrong.

1779
01:43:34,831 --> 01:43:36,298
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1780
01:43:36,366 --> 01:43:39,733
A little while longer. She's going to let us in.

1781
01:43:39,802 --> 01:43:42,032
Okay, kiddo, here's the deal.

1782
01:43:42,105 --> 01:43:44,198
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?

1783
01:43:44,274 --> 01:43:46,265
And if she doesn't let us in, we're gonna go home,

1784
01:43:46,342 --> 01:43:48,276
and we're never gonna talk about this again.

1785
01:43:48,344 --> 01:43:50,505
-DeaI? -Yeah.

1786
01:43:51,114 --> 01:43:52,809

1790
01:44:07,697 --> 01:44:10,689
If she lets us in, tell her the story like you told me.

1791
01:44:10,767 --> 01:44:13,065
-And then she'll know. - Know what?

1792
01:44:13,136 --> 01:44:15,570
I can't explain. She'll just know.

1793

-29 -29
-Twenty-nine. -Twenty-nine.

1795
01:44:27,183 --> 01:44:29,879
Twenty-nine and a quarter.

1796
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,420
Twenty-nine and a half.

1797
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,522
Twenty-nine and three-quarters.

1798
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,825
What comes after that?

1799
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:43,825
Time to go.

1800
01:44:46,469 --> 01:44:48,869
But this wasn't what was supposed to have happened.

1801
01:44:48,938 --> 01:44:50,405
-I know. -I really thought

1802
01:44:50,473 --> 01:44:54,273
she would have heard through the intercom and let us in,

1803
01:44:54,344 --> 01:44:55,902
or run down the stairs and say...

1804
01:44:55,978 --> 01:44:57,741
What story?

1805
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,947


1806
01:45:14,397 --> 01:45:16,865
-I kept the book... -Yeah?

1807
01:45:18,334 --> 01:45:21,895
...because it was the only thing that I had left of you.

1808
01:45:42,658 --> 01:45:46,617
-You must be Maya. -You must be April.

1809
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,293
So what happens now?

1810
01:45:53,369 --> 01:45:56,634
You invite us inside, and we tell you the story.

1811
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:58,900
Okay.
