00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:24,786
Medusa Film
Presenta

3
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:29,687
un film di
Giuseppe Tornatore

4
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:54,929
I still ask myself if I did the right thing

5
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,727
when I abandoned his floating city.

6
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,020
And I don't mean only for the work.

7
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:06,299
The fact is, a friend like that,

8
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,398
a real friend,

9
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:12,522
you won't meet one again.

10
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,101
If you just decide to
hang up your sea legs,

11
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:21,629
if you just want to feel something
more solid beneath your feet,

12
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,895
and if then you no loner
hear the music of the gods around you.

13
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:36,880
But, like he used to say :

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,657
"You're never really done for
as long as you got a good story...

15
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:46,448
and someone to tell it to."

16
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,035
Trouble is ...

17
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:58,067
nobody'd believe a single word of my story.

18
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,419

Pruitt Taylor Vince

20
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,954
It happened everytime...

21
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:49,336
someone would look up and see her.

22
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:54,069
It's difficult to understand.

23
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:55,171
What I'm saying is...

24
00:02:56,261 --> 00:03:00,742
there were more than
a thousand of us on that ship,

25
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:04,378
travelling richfolk, immigrants,

26
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,552
and strange people, and us.

27
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,723
Yet, there was always one!

28
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:16,404
One guy alone who would see her first.

29
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,089
Maybe he was just
sitting there eating,

30
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,199
or walking on the deck.

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,311
Maybe he was just fixing his pants.

32
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:29,418
He'd look up for a second,
A quick glance out to sea,

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,524
and he'd see her.

34
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:37,996
Then he'd just stand there,
rooted to the spot, his heart racing.

35
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:43,055
And every time,
every damn time, I swear,

36
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:50,662
he'd turn to us, towards the ship
towards everybody and scream...

37
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,835
America !

38
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:15,863
And I lost big money betting on
who'd be the first guy to see her,

39
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,185
America !

New York

64
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,615
The one who sees America first.

65
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,236
There's one on every ship !

66
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:56,156
And don't be thinking it's an
accident or some optical illusion.

67
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,974
It's destiny.

68
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:06,348
Those are people who always have
that precise instant stamped on their life.

69
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,694
And when they were kids,
you could look into their eyes,

70
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:16,965
and if you looked carefully enough
you'd already see her,

71
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,302
America.

72
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:35,239
And I've seen a few Americas !

73
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:39,614
Six years on that ship,
five crossings a year :

74
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:46,106
Europe, America and back.
Always soaking in the ocean.

75
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:50,469
When you stepped on land
you couldn't even piss straight in the john.

76
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,832
It was steady.
The john, I mean,

77
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,608
but you'd keep bobbing
like an idiot.

78
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,754
You can get off a ship all right,
but off the ocean...

79
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:06,642
I was just closing.
What can I do for you?

80
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,624
When I boarded
I was twenty-four years old,

81
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,703
And I only cared about one thing in life

82
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,956
Playing the trumpet

83
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,053
I'm selling it.

84
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,442
A Conn.

85
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,707
Not bad.

86
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,610
Best brass money can buy !

87
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:47,199
Could buy, in its day.

88
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,352
Been a while since you played, eh ?

89
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,082
If you mean for money, a couple of years.

90
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:05,836
Have been spurned by got through that thing, get rid of the blues concert's playing, and I've never stopped.

91
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,295
Don't get me wrong...

92
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:10,501
The greatest jazz players in the world
blew through brass like that.

93
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm sure, Sir.

94
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,803
But after the war,
people want brightness thing.

95
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,238
...sweet sounds, never mind jazz !

96
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,856
... your conn,
just a collector's item, now.

97
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,838
Six pounds, ten shillings Best I can do.

98
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:34,494
Christ,
that's only 25 dollars !

99
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,768
That horn's my whole life, mister.

100
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,232
Okay, no-body's going to remember me,
like Buddy Bolden or Satchmo.

101
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,658
But even just being a nobody

102
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,910
it's got to be worth more than
twenty lousy bucks!

103
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,807
It that's how things are,
I suppose it's barely worth half a crown.

104
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:03,748
Shut the door when you leave, please.

105
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:12,119
Okay, Pops, you win !

106
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,773
You just bought yourself
a piece of musical history.

107
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,143
Now, if you want my advice...

108
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:33,940
go out,
treat yourself to a decent meal.

109
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,270
At least
let me play it one last time.

110
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,435
Young man I don't have time to waste!

111
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:06,499
All right.

112
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:11,761
Hurry up, then, I'm closing.

113
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,851
Thank you.

114
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:59,621
Two peas in a pod, wouldn't you say?

115
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:06,440
You are all right?
You aren't going to be ill here, are you?

116
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:14,726
It's the music you were just playing.
Sure you recognise it?

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,883
What is it ?

118
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,898
It doesn't have a name.

119
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:30,329
Just a handful of people
have had the privilege of hearing it.

120
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:41,226
That style.

121
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:44,060
I was wondering since this morning, but...

122
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,429
I can't work out
who this amazing piano player is.

123
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,811
I don't think
you've ever heard of him.

124
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,312
Who is he ?

125
00:13:55,479 --> 00:14:02,304
If I told you that this pianist
never existed, I wouldn't be lying.

126
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:07,290
I don't like secrets.
They stink, like dirty underwear !

127
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,420
Come on now, Yank,
who the devil is playing ?

128
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,244
It's my secret.

129
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:03,040
It was the first year
of this frigging century,

130
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:06,943
as defined by an unknown
colored coal stoker on the Virginian.

131
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,590
Fucking rich-ass bastards!

132
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,844
Can't lose nothing but cigarette butts
and dirty-ass handkerchiefs !

133
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,500
Can't lose no watch,

134
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,300
not even a beat-up Elgin
or a sorry-ass cufflink.

135
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,493
What am I talking about?
Not even a fake fucking ring !

136
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:32,989
Hey, look here, a whole cigar !

137
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:36,241
Must've been somebody poor at the party.

138
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:41,739
Look at this shit !
Nasty fucker !

139
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:47,662
Damn rich. Don't forget nothing
unless they owe you some money.

140
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,376
What in the scuts you doing here ?

141
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:05,267
T.D. Lemons.

142
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:17,163
Howdy do there, Lemon !

143
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,833
Immigrant bastard !

144
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,877
Give birth in secret
somewhere on deck,

145
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,063
and then leave on the ship
another mouth to feed !

146
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:30,940
And that's a big trouble
with the immigration office !

147
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,617
What's a boy like him going to be
when the baby grows up?

148
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:35,621
Another immigrant !

149
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:39,069
Don't pay those bastards,
no mind Lemon.

150
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,030
Go on, lap it up boy !

151
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:45,685
It's not you mama's tip,
but it's real milk.

152
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,085
Go on!

153
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,135
This one they left in first class on top the piano.

154
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:56,114
They are hoping some rich guy will come take it

155
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,825
and give him a happy life.

156
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,712
- Isn't that so, Danny?
- What do you think ?

157
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,446
And who does the little ape get instead? A poor worthless nigger !

158
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,350
Fuck poverty,
you stinking sewerrats !

159
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,333
T.D.was written on the box.
Any of you shitheads know what that means ?

160
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:32,281
I forgot,
You all can't read !

161
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:33,747
I'll tell you what it means.

162
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,539
It means, "Thanks, Danny."
"Thanks, Danny"

163
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,838
They left that boy for me
and l'm keeping him.

164
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:40,716
Rest of you all can go fuck yourselves.

165
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:44,414
Danny, what are you going to call the nino?

166
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:48,152
Hell, I didn't think about that.

167
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:54,263
To start off, I name him after me,
Danny Boodman.

168
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:59,831
Then l'll put T.D. in the middle like
the rich folks puts on their cuff-links in shirts.

169
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:03,251
That give it class, to put that in the middle,
don't you think?

170
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:07,404
All fucking lawyers gots initials
in the middle of their names.

171
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,649
One of mine own was
Jonathan P.T.K. Wonder.

172
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,180
The one who sent you straight to jail for ten years?

173
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,128
You got one good memory, chicky China man!

174
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,377
If my son grow up to be a lawyer,
I swear I'll kill him myself !

175
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:25,199
But the boy's name is still going to be
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon.

176
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,405
What do you think ?

177
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:29,859
You got to like it, Danny.You're the mama!

178
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,454
I like it firmly, but it's short.
I mean, it got no finish.

179
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,106
He ain't the son of no fucking duke, Danny !

180
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:41,507
You found him on a Tuesday,
call him Tuesday !

181
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:46,842
You ain't as dumb as you look,
colored boy!

182
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:52,372
I found him the first month of
the first year of this frigging new century,

183
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:56,240
so I'm calling him Nineteen Hundred !

184
00:18:57,231 --> 00:19:00,229
Nineteen Hundred? But that's a number!

185
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:01,850
It was a number, now it's a name!

186
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,672
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred !

187
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:13,372
Danny, your little bambino is not so happy!

188
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:17,896
Come on, hurry, Hurry up. Don't worry, your mama's here.

189
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:26,353
Damn. How can something
that small shit so much?

190
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,767
"the wheels are turning"

191
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:41,724
"the Steam keeps on rising"

192
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:47,083
"oh Lord send down your light today"

193
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,783
Thanks Danny?

194
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:51,936
Thanks Danny?

195
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,949
"A child is crying"

196
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,477
"a new life is starting"

197
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:04,148
"oh Lord stay with us here below"

198
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:06,302
Thanks Danny

199
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:10,083
Thanks Danny

200
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:16,407
"One day this boy will tell a tale or two"

201
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:21,804
"for now his soul is in your hand"

202
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,905
Thanks Danny...

203
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,183
It was like
the second coming of Christ.

204
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:35,296
Maybe it was that, with all the miracles
that little kid had up his sleeve.

205
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:38,924
Hell, he did everything on the water
but walk.

206
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,219
And l heard he'd done that, too.

207
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:50,477
And that's how
little Nineteen Hundred grew up

208
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,631
inside that cradle
as big as a ship.

209
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,716
But, since Danny was afraid they'd take him away

210
00:20:56,716 --> 00:21:00,346
on account of some business concerning documents and visas,

211
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:04,134
the boy lived his early years
always hiding

212
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,687
in the belly of the Virginian.

213
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,654
Okay, now try one for yourself.

214
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:44,248
Now, look here.
Push your fingera gainst these words,

215
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:47,120
so the letters can't run off on you !

216
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,801
"Man"

217
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,317
All right, keep going

218
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,768
"go"

219
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:54,402
go on

220
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:55,600
"Ma"

221
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,826
Just a little bit more

222
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,232
"Ma"

223
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,247
Boy, you read like a god, Lemon !

224
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,838
Now, go on, put them all together,
kind of like them boiler valves.

225
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,866
Come on.

226
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:15,893
"Man... go...Mama"

227
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,799
Mango Mama. All right. Keep going.

228
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:26,812
"Ya-nk my ch-ain"

229
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:31,683
Danny, why are you laughing so much ?

230
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,559
Because these are names of horses.
Don't that make you laugh?

231
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,148
I"m just crazy about these horses' names.
Look at this one here.

232
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,991
Read there,
that one ran yesterday at Cleveland.

233
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:41,875
"Ha-ppy Hoo-fers".

234
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:47,098
Listen to this

235
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:49,071
"Sa-ssy La-ssy".

236
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:50,989
Sassy Lassy !

237
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:55,600
And this one,
"Red Hot Mama"

238
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,101
What's a mama, Danny?

239
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,440
A mama?

240
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:09,469
A mama's a horse !

241
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,771
A horse ?

242
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:11,973
Racehorse

243
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:15,801
Matter of fact, you know what I say.
Mama's the best horse in the world?

244
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:18,670
Thoroughbred, You bet on a mama,
you always win.

245
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:32,160
"Tano D'Amato
The King of Lemons"

246
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:35,285
Dad, put your finger here and read.

247
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:39,575
T.D. doesn't mean "Thanks, Danny"

248
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:43,626
Who's this pansy ass?

249
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:48,380
That's enough reading for tonight.
Too much reading's bad for you !

250
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:53,157
What else is bad, Danny?

251
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,304
Everything off the Virginian is bad.

252
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,600
Everything.

253
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,774
They got sharks on the land, they eat you alive.

254
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,007
You keep away from they, you hear?

255
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,793
See this here.

256
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,401
That's the white sharks,
worst kind.

257
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,189
Danny, what's an orphanage?

258
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:19,540
Well, a orphanage is like a great big prison

259
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,563
where they lock up folks that ain't got kids.

260
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:26,645
So if I wasn't with you
they would put you in an orphanage?

261
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:32,940
You got that right, little Lemon.
Night-night.

262
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:39,160
On that extraordinary floating city called Virginian,
more than a father,

263
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,299
Nineteen Hundred found a whole family
made of truly unique people,

264
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:46,575
like the ship's doctor.

265
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,968
Open your mouth, like this.

266
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,808
Shit, doctor,what's that red thing
hanging from your throat ? Are you sick ?

267
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,276
What's your name, doctor?

268
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:06,142
Dr Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage.

269
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,191
What a name ! If they had to
call you quickly ,they've had garner !

270
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:12,664
All that circus...

271
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:16,923
cooks, sailors,
radio operators and waiters

272
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:19,072
took good care of him.

273
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:26,425
and in their own way tried to give
him what they thought was a good education.

274
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:35,531
Also the ship's Captain, other way he
ended up being part of that crazy family.

275
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:40,151
Captain Smith, a wise man,
he only had three defects :

276
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:44,647
he suffered from claustrophobia,
had a horrible fear of drowning,

277
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:47,362
and he hated sweets.

278
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:53,554
Nineteen Hundred, how many times
have I told you not to come up here ?

279
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,014
Especially if it's to steal !

280
00:25:56,085 --> 00:26:00,538
Put the booty back where you found it
and return to your den

281
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:02,193
or I'll send you to the orphanage !

282
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,173
Quick...!

283
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:11,444
Mr. Danny Boodman, this orphan nuts must come to an end !

284
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:15,286
On the case, It's even against the law.

285
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:18,171
Fuck the law !

286
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:59,261
Hey, Mick, what do you think about
in the middle of a storm ?

287
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:04,935
What ? Do I think my lawyer
should never have been born ?

288
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,147
Yes,the storm.

289
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:13,160
You bet he was warned,
then I blew off his head !

290
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:16,155
You think of jam and bread ?

291
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,644
Yes.

292
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:22,338
Know what I think, Mick ?
I think you're loco !

293
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,364
I have gusto?

294
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,647
Danny, tell Pedro how I cut
that lawyer's balls off !

295
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:35,074
The Warldorf?
I've never been there.

296
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:39,894
The whites wouldn't let me in unless
they full of the shit out the toilets !

297
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,176
Watch out, Danny!

298
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:53,243
- Danny !
- Run, quickly !

299
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:54,887
Danny!!

300
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:04,153
- Get out the way, let me see.
- Call a doctor.

301
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,014
The doctor, quickly.

302
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:09,234
Danny, you bloody cow. Talk to me.

303
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:14,434
Ain't nothing but a pat on the back, boys.

304
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:17,844
Hang on,
the doctor's coming.

305
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:21,387
DDoctor Kla-Kla-Klaus...

306
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,310
Klau-Klauserman!

Klausermanspizwegens
Frischerri... Kemmanschov...

was disqualified.

312
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:06,645
Saucy Bossy

313

ain't a soon tooker was Brave Victory, over...

314
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:23,473
It took him three days to go toes up, old Danny.

315
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:27,139
He let go on the sixth race in Chicago,

316
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,393
Drinkable Water by two lengths over Vegetable Soup,

317
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:34,516
and five over Blue Foudation.

318
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,085
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

319
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:40,299
I will fear no evil for Thou art with me..."

320
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,385
Dr. Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage

321
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,722
declared that if Danny hadn't laugh so much ,

322
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,626
he probably would have recovered.

323
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:51,967
But history isn't made of "ifs".

324
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:55,275
And the only thing we can say for sure

325
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,898
is that suddenly,

326
00:29:57,368 --> 00:30:02,394
Lemon Nineteen Hundred
became an orphan for the second time.

327
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:07,097
"Thanks Danny"

328
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:15,383
In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

329
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,017
Amen.

330
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:33,858
おんがく(on gaku)
Music.

331
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,868
Nineteen Hundred
was eight years old then.

332
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:56,063
He'd made the trip between Europe and America about fifty times, I imaged.

333
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,536
The ocean was his home.

334
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:07,267
Yeah, and his skin was covered in scales
and he had two fins, instead of arms !

335
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,606
It's all true, Pops.

336
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:12,012
You can bet your soul on it.

337
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,535
But that's absurd !

338
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:14,799
The God's truth!

339
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,081
He never set foot on dry land.
Never.

340
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:24,644
He'd seen it from the ports a hundred times,
but he never got off the boat.

341
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:30,184
Problem was as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist,

342
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:35,474
there wasn't a city, a parish, a hospital, jail or baseball team

343
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:38,553
that had his name any place.

344
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:43,338
He didn't have a country, he didn't
even have a birth date. No family.

345
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:50,013
He was eight years old, but officially,
he had never even been born.

346
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,839
"No Entry"

347
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:45,753
America !

348
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,755
America !

349
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:07,650
It's Kidnapping.

350
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:11,028
Charges of kidnapping could be
brought against you, Captain,

351
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:14,698
if one fine day the boy's kin
were to show up.

352
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:17,910
After eight years,
l seriously doubt it.

353
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:23,582
However, I think the time has come to
allow the boy to have a normal life.

354
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:30,798
I've written a personal note which I'd ask you
to deliver the head of state orphanage.

355
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:34,282
Very well, Captain.
Now where will we find the lad ?

356
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:37,241
Boatswain,
show these gentlemen the way.

357
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,698
Forward.

358
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:49,586
They are looking for 1900.

359
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:51,639
they got to find
the entire space.

360
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:02,841
Stand aside

361
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,376
You there! Hold that cargo!

362
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:06,929
I'm going to search everything.

363
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:16,585
- Have you seen a little boy?
- I never saw him.

364
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:22,693
22 days later, when the Virginian
headed for Rio de Janeiro,

365
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:27,924
nobody had found Nineteen Hundred,
one hadn't crew knows what happened to him.

366
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,384
Everybody, they had death in their hearts,

367
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:33,611
because they had all gotten
attached to the little boy,

368
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,035
although no-one would say so.

369
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:41,931
Captain...! Wake up !

370
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,574
Let me sleep.

371
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:45,537
Captain, this is emergency!

372
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:46,563
Christ !

373
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,138
We are sinking?
We are sinking!

374
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:51,220
Worse! Much worse!

375
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,228
What's his name ?

376
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:42,999
Nineteen Hundred.

377
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:46,434
Not the song, the boy.

378
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:47,862
Nineteen Hundred.

379
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,272
Like the song !

380
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:59,157
He would have wanted to ask him a lot of
questions that moment Captain Smith.

381
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:02,447
Like : "Where the hell
did you learn to play the piano?"

382
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:05,582
Or : "ln what damn hole
have you been hiding?"

383
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,738
Or : "Where in Christ's name
are you getting this music from?

384
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:13,781
which seems to enter your veins
without you even realizing it."

385
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,403
But he was a man in uniform,

386
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:19,666
and the only thing he managed to say was:

387
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:24,742
Nineteen Hundred, all of this is
entirely against the regulations.

388
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,396
Fuck the regulations !

389
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:34,481
His exact words :
"Fuck the regulations !"

390
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:44,792
But l don't understand what the
record has to do with any of this.

391
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,965
You're not the sharpest knife in
the drawer, Pops.

392
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,978
That's his music.

393
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,053
The music of Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred.

394
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:02,287
The greatest ivory tickler
on the seven seas.

395
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,031
Amazing !

396
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:12,606
So..., if that's all true,
this record must be worth a fortune !

397
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:17,867
This record can make us both rich.

398
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:22,154
That record shouldn't exist.

399
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:27,668
The only existing matrix
was destroyed right after it was cut.

400
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:34,102
Well, this is a matrix.

401
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:41,056
Quite handy for on-the-spot recordings
that sort of business.

402
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,789
How did you get your hands on this?

403
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:57,975
I spend the better part of the day
putting the bits and pieces together.

404
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:04,179
I found them by accident.
Hidden inside one of those two pianos.

405
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,032
I bought them from a second-hand dealer

406
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:28,102
They've emptied out an old hospital ship
down at Plymouth.

407
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,205
They're going to destroy it
in a couple of days.

408
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,767
What do you mean "destroy" ?

409
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,844
Where's the old hospital ship ?

410
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,920
It's over there, mate.

411
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:13,599
Thank you.

412
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:16,367
Slow down....
Not so fast with that pulley.

413
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:21,638
Watch that! These aren't bananas, you know.

414
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:25,272
Easy up there, easy.

415
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:50,717
Where are you from ?

416
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,917
Liverpool.

417
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,528
- What do you do?
- I'm a barber.

418
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,592
- Sign him on.
- Thanks very much.

419
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:58,415
Next.
What's your trade ?

420
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:01,872
I'm a carpenter. A cook, barber...

421
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:04,164
Too many things for our test. Get out !

422
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:07,073
- I'm also a good mechanic.
- Get out ! Next.

423
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,218
What do you do ?

424
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:11,949
I play the trumpet.

425
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:15,431
We've already got musicians on board.
Next.

426
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:17,772
Get out!

427
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,922
Where the hell's he going ?

428
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:35,133
What's that?

429
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,436
I don't know.

430
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:41,253
When you don't know what it is,
it's jazz !

431
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:42,648
Jazz !

432
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,238
What's your name ?

433
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,162
Max Tooney, Sir.

434
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:47,962
Right !

435
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:03,623
It was the happiest day of my life.

436
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:06,440
All those people
with hope in their eyes,

437
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,171
the goodbyes, the sirens....

438
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:12,680
And that big floating world starting to move.

439
00:44:12,722 --> 00:44:17,532
It felt like one big party,
a huge bash just for me.

440
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:22,473
But just three days later
the ocean got tired of the festivities.

441
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:29,264
Suddenly, in the middle of the night,
she went berserk and all hell broke loose.

442
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:34,392
Now, a guy blowing a trumpet on a ship

443
00:44:34,492 --> 00:44:37,346
can't do much
when there's a raging storm.

444
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:42,037
Not playing the trumpet is about the only thing
you can do just not to complicate matters.

445
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:44,638
But I couldn't bear being down there.

446
00:44:44,738 --> 00:44:47,083
Same line kept raging in my brain :

447
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,239
"he died like a rat."

448
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:56,880
And the last thing I wanted
was to die like a rat.

449
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:21,448
Damn it, I'm lost !

450
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:57,443
Hey, Conn?
What's the matter?

451
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,903
Lose your sea legs?

452
00:46:01,322 --> 00:46:02,898
You're the new trumpet man,
aren't you?

453
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:04,332
And you blow a Conn?

454
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:12,148
Come with me.
I have a cure for your misery.

455
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,322
Follow me.

456
00:46:51,464 --> 00:46:52,882
Take the brakes off, please.

457
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:55,439
What...! That's crazy!

458
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:59,588
Trust me.
Just take the brakes off.

459
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,785
Hop on next to me.

460
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:19,912
What are you,
some kind of nut case.

461
00:47:20,012 --> 00:47:22,749
You better get on now or you never will.

462
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:56,862
Tell me something, do you have children?

463
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:01,386
Shit, They'll lock you up
in the orphanage one of these days!

464
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,892
He's nuts.

465
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,930
Whoa, Mama !

466
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,902
I see you know your horses.

467
00:48:11,911 --> 00:48:13,291
Just a litte.

468
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,557
Good man!

469
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,847
It was like the sea was rocking us.

470
00:48:30,155 --> 00:48:33,124
And while we were floating around the colorants

471
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,301
and brushing the lamps and furniture,

472
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:40,274
I realised that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.

473
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:43,140
Us and her, crazy dancers,

474
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,279
locked in a joyful waltz
on the golden parquet of night.

475
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:55,394
Want some ?
Cheers !

476
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,535
Good evening, Captain.

477
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:52,687
Care for a ride?

478
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,108
Nineteen Hundred !

479
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:55,971
I should know it was you.

480
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:59,569
Who else on this ship
would do anything as lunatic as this ?

481
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:01,185
Except you! Nineteen Hundred!

482
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:03,232
I was just experimenting, sir.

483
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,111
When I get kings up,

484
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,455
I'm sure you nothing among this will never happen again.

485
00:50:09,317 --> 00:50:14,737
Yeah, it's missed brakes.
should fix those. grace!

486
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:23,670
Tell me again how big the fucking window was?

487
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,345
What a big fucking window!

488
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,616
You know, we're going to be shoveling coal on this ship till eternity.

489
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,461
No shit !

490
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,190
Least you know
what you'll be doing when you grow up!

491
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:59,770
- Hey, Conn.
- What ?

492
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:02,383
You're from New Orleans, right ?

493
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,771
How did you know that ?

494
00:51:05,423 --> 00:51:07,277
I love that town.

495
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,435
Really? I haven't been there in a while.

496
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:14,220
In winter, it's beautiful.

497
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:18,631
And in March,

498
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:26,305
you can always count on one afternoon
when you least expect it.

499
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:31,332
The fog slides in a milky barrier

500
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:37,534
hangs just below the street lamps.
It cuts everything off!

501
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:42,777
Iike a white blade. And it's magic!

502
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:49,605
Houses lose their top floors,
trees lose their branches,

503
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:56,067
St. Louis Cathedral loses its spires,
people passing by they lose their heads.

504
00:51:56,167 --> 00:52:00,109
So from the neck up everything disappears.

505
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:04,369
All you can see in Jackson Square
is a bunch of decapitated bodies,

506
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:07,834
stumbling around
and bumping into each other saying:

507
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:10,051
"How's your mama and them?"

508
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:15,256
That's it!
Too bad it doesn't last long.

509
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:17,827
But how do you know all these things ?

510
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,066
You know,

511
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:31,698
ever since I came on board,
I been hearing a lot of talk about a guy.

512
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:36,264
He got this name runs on like
a Georgia freight train.

513
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:43,032
He's supposed to have been born on this ship and never been off it since.

514
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:45,084
Crazy story.

515
00:52:45,384 --> 00:52:48,470
Twenty years without ever setting foot on land?

516
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,625
Twenty-seven.

517
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:54,155
They say this guy makes music
that's never been heard before.

518
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:55,707
I've heard of him, too.

519
00:52:55,807 --> 00:53:00,406
First off, I thought you were the guy.

520
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,460
- But then something didn't add up.
- Of course.

521
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,713
I figured:

522
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:10,195
if he's Nineteen Hundred
how could he know New Orleans so well?

523
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:14,235
Because you've been to New Orleans.

524
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,113
If I told you I'd never set foot in that town,
would you believe me?

525
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,097
Whoever you are,
Max Tooney.

526
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:30,535
Glad to meet you.

527
00:53:46,051 --> 00:53:47,731
How we doing?

528
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:50,412
We're supposed to blow it up

529
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:54,061
not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes!

530
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,485
We're almost done,
just laying the last charges.

531
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,479
Where the hell are you going ?

532
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:07,948
- I have to look for someone.
- Stop him!

533
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:10,796
It's not eazy....

534
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,841
Get down there....

535
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:18,493
You bastards, let me on board !

536
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,911
Could you run that by me again?
I don't think I got the straight.

537
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,864
You bet. I'll run that by you again.

538
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:32,228
You're not going to blow up a goddamn thing,
'cause my best friend's on this ship.

539
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:34,947
You'll all be responsible for murder.

540
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,155
Get him out of here.

541
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:38,807
Do whatever you want,
but get him off my case!

542
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:41,469
I'm not making this up and I'm not crazy.

543
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:43,873
If I tell you there's a man aboard the Virginian,
it means there is !

544
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:47,389
Jesus Christ,
it means there's a man aboard the Virginian.

545
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,672
We cleaned that scuttle from stem to stern.
Not even doorknobs were left.

546
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:54,018
Only dynamite. Dynamite!
Lots of dynamite.

547
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,909
How can you be so sure
that's a man on board?

548
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,638
If you've any proof, out with it.

549
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,330
Because I'm the horse's arse
who has to throw that switch.

550
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,926
I'm sure he's there.

551
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,814
I spent the best years of my life
on the Virginian.

552
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:14,327
Did you find an upright piano
in third class ?

553
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:21,490
The Virginian is the only ship in the world
with a piano in third class.

554
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,584
Was there or wasn't there
an upright piano in third class ?

555
00:55:25,684 --> 00:55:29,805
Well, there was a piano in third class,
but it was not right. It was horizontal.

556
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,420
Even it was round,

557
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:34,790
I don't see what the hell is the goddamned piano
got to do with a ghost aboard that ship?

558
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,154
there's thousands of poor dead souls
hanging out of that hospital ship!

559
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:41,387
Get out of my sight,
or I'll call the police.

560
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:43,538
You kick off your hands off me !

561
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,380
Listen...

562
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:51,011
Amongst those thousands of dead souls
is the greatest piano player in the world !

563
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,590
Yet don't say:
a bleeding piano player.

564
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:56,308
And what were you doing
all those years aboard the Virginian?

565
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,788
Tuning the strings?

566
00:55:58,152 --> 00:56:00,407
What was I doing on the Virginian ?

567
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,449
What were you doing ?

568
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:13,384
I played!

569
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:16,153
Ladies and gentlemen,

570
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,948
Meine Damen und Herren,

571
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:20,133
Signore e signori,

572
00:56:20,135 --> 00:56:21,535
Mesdames et Messieurs,

573
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,991
Bill Douglas here to
welcomes you aboard the Virginian.

574
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:30,763
And wishes you a pleasant evening
in the accompany of the Atlantic Jazz Band !

575
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:36,689
Perfetto !

576
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:43,717
Please, Nineteen Hundred,
just the normal notes. Okay?

577
00:56:56,545 --> 00:56:59,465
We played because
the ocean is big and scary.

578
00:56:59,565 --> 00:57:02,502
We played so that people
wouldn't feel the time passing

579
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,311
and could forget where
and who they were.

580
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:07,657
We played to make them dance,

581
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:12,577
because when you dance you can't die and you feel like god.

582
00:57:12,677 --> 00:57:14,440
We played ragtime,

583
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:18,182
because that's the music God dances to,
when nobody's watching him,

584
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,298
assuming that God is black !

585
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:26,636
End of the line boys !

586
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:33,588
Jesus, I must be a real sinner.
Is that it, God ?

587
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:51,738
Right! Look he'd done !

588
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:54,321
It's sweet!

589
00:58:21,637 --> 00:58:23,614
But it was in third class

590
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,504
that Nineteen Hundred
played the music which was really his.

591
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,755
He'd go in the afternoons
or late at night,

592
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:33,689
when he didn't have to play the normal notes.

593
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,195
And his music was made of notes
that were everything but normal.

594
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:06,659
What the hell do you think about
when you're playing?

595
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:10,284
Where does your mind go?
when you hit the keys?

596
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:14,135
Last night
I was in a beautiful country.

597
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,070
Women had perfume in their hair.
Everything glowed.

598
01:00:19,227 --> 01:00:21,229
And it was full of tigers.

599
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:23,331
He traveled.

600
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,163
And each time he ended up someplace different.

601
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:30,135
In the heart of London,
on a train in the middle of the country,

602
01:00:30,136 --> 01:00:32,371
on the edge of a giant volcano,

603
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,534
in the biggest church in the world,

604
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:39,975
counting the columns
and staring up at the crucifixes.

605
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:42,650
He travelled.

606
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:46,751
Guaglio', facci sentire una bella tarantella!
(Hey, man, play us a tarantella !)

607
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:49,996
E tu fammi capire come fa questa tarantella, paisa'!
(Tell me how the tarantella goes, man !)

608
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:15,933
The people getting off the ship
would talk about a strange music

609
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:21,663
and a pianist who looked like
he had four hands, for all the notes he was hit.

610
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,686
Weird tales circulated,
some even true.

611
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,877
Like the one about an American senator
named Wilson,

612
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:39,837
who used to travel in third class

613
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:46,366
just to hear the music of Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred.

614
01:01:57,608 --> 01:01:59,581
America !

615
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:22,767
Why did you stop ?
Please, continue.

616
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:29,535
I'm sorry, Senator, it made port.
I only play on the open sea.

617
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:30,980
But that's absurd.

618
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:33,340
Ports are land to me.
I don't play on land.

619
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,595
You mean, you've never gone on tour?

620
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:37,279
What does that mean ?

621
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,188
Long trips on which artists display
their talents around the world.

622
01:02:45,288 --> 01:02:49,344
In a sense, that's all I ever done.
In my way.

623
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:51,641
Excuse me.

624
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:56,249
Would you grant me an interview?

625
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:02,546
An inter. . .what ?

626
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:04,510
An interview?

627
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:06,842
What's that ?

628
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:09,814
The senator asks :

629
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:15,169
Is there anything you enjoy about
when you go back to your home town?"

630
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:16,833
Nineteen Hundred answered:

631
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,815
What I like to do best in Paris is....

632
01:03:19,815 --> 01:03:25,283
wait under the Eiffeltower at sunset, for the people who throw themselves off the top

633
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:29,607
and try to guess what country
they're from by their screams

634
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:32,959
before they go splat
all over the ground !

635
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:46,258
Why the hell don't you get off?
Just once? One time?

636
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:52,047
See the world for yourself
with your own eyes?

637
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:57,937
You ever think about it?
You could do anything you wanted to.

638
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:01,367
People would go crazy for you.

639
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:05,587
You could make beaucoup bucks, man.

640
01:04:05,687 --> 01:04:10,396
Get yourself the finest house,
Get yourself a wife.

641
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:13,045
Why not ?

642
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,580
God knows you can't spend the rest of your life
traveling back and forth like some yo-yo.

643
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,858
The world is out there.
Nothing but a gangplank to cross.

644
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:35,537
And what's a gangplank?
A few stupid steps.

645
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,483
Christ, everything is waiting
at the bottom of those steps.

646
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:42,180
Why don't you just do it?

647
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:44,474
One time.

648
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:48,052
Why don't you just get off?

649
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:57,824
Why? Why? Why?

650
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,964
Why? Why?

651
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,990
I think you land people

652
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:10,200
waste a lot of time wondering why.

653
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,734
Winter comes and
you can't wait for summer.

654
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:17,844
Summer comes and
you live in dread of winter.

655
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:21,189
That's way you never tire of traveling.

656
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:26,744
Always chasing someplace far away
where it's always summer.

657
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,467
Doesn't sound like a good bet to me.

658
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:48,616
Hold it, stop everything !

659
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,681
Tell them to lose the detonators.

660
01:05:50,683 --> 01:05:52,297
Unhook them !

661
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:54,213
What's going on, boss?

662
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:37,071
If I were you, I'll pray hard we'll find somebody hidden on this paterost.

663
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:41,036
Even somebody who can mistake a three-legged cockroach for a piano.

664
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:44,004
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

665
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:49,315
Sir, i found it.

666
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:52,770
This was his cabin.

667
01:09:18,393 --> 01:09:21,277
Forgive me for allowing myself to,

668
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,909
your music was so strong.

669
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:32,505
Northern ltaly, I'll bet.

670
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:36,154
Bravo, Friuli, to be exact.

671
01:09:36,157 --> 01:09:38,856
But don't stop playing. suona.

672
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,827
Want a cicca?

673
01:09:52,728 --> 01:09:55,370
You don't look too happy
to be going to America.

674
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:56,959
It's not America.

675
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:07,078
It's everything I leave behind.

676
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:11,495
Until a few years ago
I know only my field.

677
01:10:11,497 --> 01:10:16,299
The world for me started and ended there
in that little piece of the land.

678
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,773
I never walked down
the main street of a city.

679
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,786
Maybe you can't understand, but....

680
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:26,889
I understand that perfectly.

681
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:32,621
I know someone
who went through something very similar.

682
01:10:32,654 --> 01:10:35,949
And one fine day
did his field go dry, too?

683
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:39,407
And did his wife also run off with a priest?

684
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:47,100
And did the fever take his five children?

685
01:10:47,891 --> 01:10:50,256
No. But he ended up alone, too.

686
01:10:52,382 --> 01:10:54,713
Then he is more lucky than me

687
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:58,957
I still have a daughter.
The young one.

688
01:10:59,057 --> 01:11:00,779
She survived.

689
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:07,064
And it's for her that I decide
one day to fight against my bad luck,

690
01:11:07,164 --> 01:11:09,625
and travel all over without a destination.

691
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:18,885
And then one day, when I go through
one of the many towns I never see before,

692
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:24,623
I come to a hill,
And then I see...

693
01:11:24,624 --> 01:11:27,069
the most beautiful thing in my life.

694
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:29,762
The sea !

695
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,408
The sea?

696
01:11:32,236 --> 01:11:34,219
I never see it before.

697
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:38,844
It was like lightning hit me.

698
01:11:38,845 --> 01:11:41,665
Because I hear the voice.

699
01:11:42,837 --> 01:11:44,283
The voice of the sea?

700
01:11:44,284 --> 01:11:46,369
Yeah, the voice of the sea.

701
01:11:49,163 --> 01:11:51,148
I've never heard it.

702
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:55,667
The voice of the sea,
it is like a shout.

703
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,233
A shout big and strong,

704
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:02,352
screaming and screaming.
And the thing it was screaming was:

705
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:04,763
"You !

706
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:09,746
with shit instead brains!

707
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:14,887
life is immense,
can you understand that?

708
01:12:16,475 --> 01:12:18,448
lmmense !"

709
01:12:18,903 --> 01:12:23,305
I never think of it that way.
A revolution was in my head.

710
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:28,933
That's how I suddenly
decide to change my life,

711
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:32,782
to start fresh.

712
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:38,556
Change life. Start fresh.

713
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:40,882
Tell that to your friend.

714
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,104
1900!

715
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:49,851
1900!

716
01:12:50,777 --> 01:12:54,309
It's Max Tooney, your friend.

717
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:58,907
Come on out, Nineteen Hundred!
I'm your friend, too.

718
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:03,645
Even if we've never met.
Don't worry, no cops !

719
01:13:20,954 --> 01:13:24,261
You said something about a piano.
Where was it exactly?

720
01:13:24,262 --> 01:13:26,231
We found it over there.

721
01:13:30,749 --> 01:13:34,076
Nineteen Hundred !

722
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:39,070
Nineteen Hundred !

723
01:13:52,026 --> 01:13:54,121
Ladies and gentlemen,

724
01:13:54,715 --> 01:13:56,789
Meine Damen und Herren,

725
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:59,244
Signore e signori,

726
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:01,747
Mesdames et Messieurs,

727
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:08,850
maestro Bill Douglas here,
welcoming you on board the Virginian.

728
01:14:09,707 --> 01:14:17,166
wishing you a very pleasant evening
in the accompany of the Atlantic Jazz Band !

729
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:21,444
On the violin yours truly, Bill Douglas!
(The role's name should be Fritz Hermann)

730
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,739
Tuba and bass, Freddie Loyacano!

731
01:14:27,013 --> 01:14:29,369
Max Tooney on trumpet!

732
01:14:31,143 --> 01:14:35,100
Jim Jim Breath Gallup
on trombone !

733
01:14:36,184 --> 01:14:39,253
Sam Scalisi on the drums !

734
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:45,840
On saxophone,
Sam Sleepy Washington !

735
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:49,744
On banjo,
Oscar Delaguerra !

736
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:52,914
And finally, on piano,

737
01:14:53,187 --> 01:14:57,030
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred

738
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,124
The greatest !

739
01:15:15,622 --> 01:15:18,415
For the last time Nineteen Hundred, just...

740
01:15:18,415 --> 01:15:19,739
just the normal notes

741
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:21,971
What are you doing here ?
Take your places !

742
01:15:55,678 --> 01:15:58,332
Hey, end of the line !

743
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:10,150
You've really got over me,
you son of a dirty stoker !

744
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:15,847
One night the public's not going to
appreciate your antics.

745
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:17,590
And that night, I swear,

746
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:20,811
I'm going to throw you overboard myself.

747
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,853
Where do yu get it?

748
01:16:47,617 --> 01:16:48,714
What?

749
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:49,872
The music.

750
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:51,116
I don't know.

751
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:53,217
You see that woman over there?
for example?

752
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,682
She looks like someone
who's just killed her husband

753
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,383
with the help of her lover.

754
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:04,869
And now she's running off
with the family jewels.

755
01:17:06,024 --> 01:17:07,531
Don't you think this music's her?

756
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:09,440
Damn, it's true!

757
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:15,019
You see that guy over there?

758
01:17:16,614 --> 01:17:18,092
He can't forget a thing.

759
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:21,656
His head bursts with memories
and there's nothing he can do about it.

760
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,858
Listen to his music.

761
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,119
And look at that one there?

762
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:47,261
She looks like a prostitute
who's thinking of becoming a nun.

763
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,601
That's incredible!

764
01:18:00,152 --> 01:18:01,800
Now, look at this one.

765
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:04,981
See how he walks?

766
01:18:14,533 --> 01:18:21,280
I'd say he's in someone else's suit
judging by the way he wears it.

767
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,244
I'd say he's a stowaway slipped into first class

768
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:34,016
looking for an amorous adventure.

769
01:18:34,116 --> 01:18:36,791
This one's got America stamped on his eyes.

770
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,304
He'll be the first one to see it.
l can already hear him screaming.

771
01:18:42,405 --> 01:18:45,448
He knew how to read,
Nineteen Hundred.

772
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:48,935
Not books,
anybody can do that.

773
01:18:49,035 --> 01:18:53,582
He knew how to read people,
the signs people carry on them.

774
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:56,374
Places, sounds, scents,

775
01:18:56,376 --> 01:19:00,305
their land, their story.
Everything written on them.

776
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:06,327
He would read, and with infinite care
he would catalogue, organise,

777
01:19:06,327 --> 01:19:10,725
and make order in that immense map
that he was drawing in his mind.

778
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:13,347
Maybe he'd never seen the world,

779
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:18,107
but for almost thirty years, the world
had been passing on that ship.

780
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:23,480
And for almost thirty years
on that ship, he'd been spying on it

781
01:19:23,581 --> 01:19:26,127
and he would steal its soul.

782
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:36,101
America !

783
01:19:42,496 --> 01:19:46,208
I went into her room,
she jumped on me,

784
01:19:46,374 --> 01:19:49,461
- and I tore her clothes off.
- Go on !

785
01:19:49,628 --> 01:19:52,714
- Do you always make up this crap ?
- Sure !

786
01:20:55,068 --> 01:20:59,015
Singleton, Lee Claire.

787
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:16,051
Hallo ?

788
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:18,893
Hallo, you don't know me,

789
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:22,249
But I was wondering
if we could have a little chat

790
01:21:22,349 --> 01:21:25,574
A little chat? What about?

791
01:21:25,674 --> 01:21:28,022
About anything you like....
Weather conditions? anything you choose.

792
01:21:28,122 --> 01:21:31,026
Anything You pick or chuck the subject.

793
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,371
Is this an obscene phone call?

794
01:21:42,984 --> 01:21:44,064
Hallo ?

795
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,272
Hallo, is that the race-track ?

796
01:21:46,272 --> 01:21:48,449
Yeah, you betting ?

797
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,859
Can you tell me if Mama's racing ?

798
01:21:50,959 --> 01:21:52,416
No, it's your sister !

799
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:56,230
I think there's a misunderstanding.

800
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:58,441
You take you misunderstanding and shove it!

801
01:21:58,442 --> 01:22:00,881
As I known, the telephone should
bring out the best in people.

802
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:03,436
You keep this up, I swear I'll come over there
and bring out the best in you.

803
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:06,237
you got still the time.
You think I don't know who you are!

804
01:22:09,394 --> 01:22:11,319
Christ, he's already here !

805
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:22,781
Hey, You the fish
with the twenty-dollar name?

806
01:22:38,272 --> 01:22:39,283
Come on out.

807
01:22:39,848 --> 01:22:41,034
Shit!

808
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,488
Hey! You! Wait a minute!

809
01:22:42,488 --> 01:22:45,196
Hey! Wait! Just want to talk to you!

810
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:52,275
Holy shit!

811
01:22:52,276 --> 01:22:53,772
What hell are we, men?

812
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:56,840
Hold still, you little son of a bitch!

813
01:23:00,502 --> 01:23:01,838
Come on out!

814
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,252
We don't want to hurt you.

815
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:06,865
We're players, man.
Sidemen.

816
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:08,612
Damn

817
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:29,449
Bon appetit ! (enjoy your meal)

818
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:32,989
You can that again, brother.
You can that again.

819
01:23:53,572 --> 01:23:56,824
You the one that plays ten kinds
of jazz rolled into one?

820
01:23:56,824 --> 01:24:00,711
Tell you the truth, I've never counted them
I'm just a piano player.

821
01:24:00,712 --> 01:24:02,024
It's him.

822
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,412
Well, you would better start counting, buddy.

823
01:24:04,432 --> 01:24:07,105
The man who invented jazz
sent us here.

824
01:24:07,106 --> 01:24:10,046
Really? What does he want with me?

825
01:24:10,047 --> 01:24:13,441
He challenges you to a piano duel!

826
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:16,534
A piano duel ?

827
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,664
What the hell is a piano duel ?

828
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,042
It's a duel,
but instead pistols of pianos.

829
01:24:23,045 --> 01:24:27,590
It's a musicians thing.
No blood, just a little hate.

830
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:31,693
Real hate, under the skin.
It riffs like you never heard.

831
01:24:31,695 --> 01:24:36,536
It could last all night sometimes,
at the end, one would win.

832
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:42,480
Nineteen Hundred !

833
01:24:54,948 --> 01:24:58,616
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure he's still here.

834
01:25:00,556 --> 01:25:03,320
If I know him at all,
he won't be any place else.

835
01:25:03,688 --> 01:25:05,406
I'm sure of that.

836
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:06,820
He's gone.

837
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:08,705
What would he
have done here without a piano ?

838
01:25:08,725 --> 01:25:09,768
Everything has gone!

839
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:12,811
Besides, with the war, who knows ?

840
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:16,302
Maybe he's no longer part of this dirty world.

841
01:25:17,604 --> 01:25:20,750
One like him
doesn't end up like everyone else.

842
01:25:21,696 --> 01:25:23,104
It's not his style.

843
01:25:23,105 --> 01:25:24,314
Think what you want.

844
01:25:24,315 --> 01:25:26,996
But I can't ask the owners
to keep this carcass in the water

845
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,646
just because somebody on board
who doesn't exist.

846
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,896
I can't put it off much longer.

847
01:25:32,659 --> 01:25:38,914
Nineteen Hundred, listen,
I have to talk to you !

848
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,969
And what about the duel?
What happened?

849
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,584
Jelly Roll Morton boarded the Virginian in Boston,

850
01:25:47,654 --> 01:25:51,189
summer of 1931.

851
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,276
Dressed entirely in white,

852
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,230
had a diamond on his finger
as size as a meatball !

853
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:00,892
Even the garters on his socks
were diamond studded.

854
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:11,331
Jelly Roll, what's the reason
for a trip to Europe on a steamer?

855
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,176
when you've never set boat
that bigger than in Mississippi river.

856
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,716
I don't give a damn about Europe !

857
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:19,216
The only reason why I'm hopping this crappy tub

858
01:26:19,316 --> 01:26:21,742
is because there's a gentleman I want to meet.

859
01:26:22,012 --> 01:26:25,400
They say he plays a hot piano!

860
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:31,690
But I hear he has a little thing about setting foot on land.

861
01:26:32,782 --> 01:26:34,608
Is he talking about me?

862
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:36,294
You bet, he's talking about you.

863
01:26:38,132 --> 01:26:44,377
...He say,"Hey, Jelly,
Someone plays better piano than you."

864
01:26:45,846 --> 01:26:47,484
So I say to myself:

865
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:50,491
Self how can this cat play so well

866
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:54,522
when he don't even have the balls
to get off the goddamn ship.

867
01:26:54,622 --> 01:26:59,932
Hey, hot damn, Jelly,
You invented jazz!

868
01:27:02,227 --> 01:27:04,247
Then I says to myself :

869
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:06,557
"you can afford a first-class ticket to Europe

870
01:27:06,558 --> 01:27:10,482
and the boat that's going to take you just by lifting a finger."

871
01:27:10,483 --> 01:27:13,065
Get a shot of it, boys, get a shot!

872
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:15,369
Tell the truth: Are you scared?

873
01:27:16,462 --> 01:27:17,855
I don't know.

874
01:27:18,937 --> 01:27:22,495
Why a duel?
What happens when you have a duel?

875
01:27:30,497 --> 01:27:33,231
It seemed like he really didn't care much.

876
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,921
Like he didn't even understand it. But he was curious.

877
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,789
He wanted to hear how the devil, the inventor of jazz played.

878
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:46,000
He didn't say that is a joke. He really believed
that the guy invented jazz.

879
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:48,969
I believe he thought he can learn something new.

880
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:52,063
That's just how he was,
a little like old Danny.

881
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:53,837
He didn't have any sporting sense.

882
01:27:53,837 --> 01:27:57,908
He didn't give a damn who won,
it was the rest that amazed him.

883
01:27:57,933 --> 01:27:59,133
All the rest.

884
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,227
It's true !

885
01:29:51,187 --> 01:29:55,733
I believe you're sitting in my seat.

886
01:30:07,165 --> 01:30:09,473
You're the one who invented jazz, right?

887
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:11,692
That's what they say.

888
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:20,068
And you're the one who can't play unless
you have the ocean under your ass? right?

889
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,996
That's what I say.

890
01:30:31,486 --> 01:30:34,680
Excusez-moi, s'il vous plait !
(Excuse me, please!)

891
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:27,626
Jelly Roll Morton did not play,
he caressed those notes.

892
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,481
It sounded like a silk slip
sliding down a woman's body.

893
01:31:31,581 --> 01:31:34,966
His hands were butterflies, so light.

894
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:39,288
He got his start in the famed
tenderloin districts of New Orleans,

895
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:43,391
and all did he learn to stroke
the keyboard in those whorehouses.

896
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:46,941
People doing the deed upstairs didn't want any uproar.

897
01:31:46,945 --> 01:31:51,404
They wanted music that would slip
behind the curtains, under the beds,

898
01:31:51,493 --> 01:31:56,053
without disturbing the passion.
That's the kind of music he played.

899
01:31:56,055 --> 01:32:00,504
And in that, he truly was the best.

900
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:03,296
- Bravo !
- Bravo !

901
01:33:32,909 --> 01:33:36,198
Your turn, sailor.

902
01:33:50,865 --> 01:33:52,119
Come on.

903
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,043
What's he doing ?

904
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:37,827
"Silent Night"?

905
01:34:37,828 --> 01:34:39,880
Isn't that a Christmas carol?

906
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:42,287
Does he understand it's a contest?

907
01:34:42,387 --> 01:34:44,527
"Silenet Night" is jazz?

908
01:34:44,827 --> 01:34:47,186
Is it Christmas already?

909
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:12,943
Did he win, signor?

910
01:35:12,944 --> 01:35:14,826
No, they're just warming up.

911
01:35:14,827 --> 01:35:16,030
Bravo !

912
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:21,284
Come on, Jelly Roll, show us what jazz is all about!

913
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,846
What is wrong with you?

914
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:22,131
I can't help it. Music makes me cry.

915
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:24,077
The whole crew bet on you!

916
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:27,805
I put a year's pay on the line!
And you're crying ?

917
01:36:27,807 --> 01:36:30,785
Now you cut that out and start thinking your music!

918
01:36:30,983 --> 01:36:32,074
Can I bet, too ?

919
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:36,146
No! It's bad luck to bet on yourself.

920
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:39,029
I don't want to bet on me. I want to bet on him. He's the greatest.

921
01:36:41,223 --> 01:36:43,193
You are crazy, you know that?

922
01:36:43,195 --> 01:36:45,720
That way, if you lose I'll get your money back.

923
01:37:46,268 --> 01:37:49,977
It's exactly the same piece of music, darling.

924
01:37:50,245 --> 01:37:53,984
Yeah, sure, it's OK. But this is a competition.

925
01:37:55,938 --> 01:37:58,248
This is really the end of the line.

926
01:38:01,472 --> 01:38:03,224
Unbelievable.

927
01:39:05,635 --> 01:39:07,054
Did he lose, signor?

928
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:08,486
Not yet.

929
01:39:09,905 --> 01:39:12,832
Bravo!

930
01:39:20,659 --> 01:39:22,849
You stick this up your ass!

931
01:40:20,081 --> 01:40:21,506
Hey, Max?

932
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:24,060
Give me a cigarette, will you?

933
01:40:24,062 --> 01:40:26,548
You're not handling this well.

934
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:27,985
Just give me a cigarette.

935
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:29,692
You don't smoke.

936
01:40:30,012 --> 01:40:34,651
What is the matter with you?
You could lick this guy with one hand!

937
01:40:34,949 --> 01:40:36,313
Come on!

938
01:41:00,483 --> 01:41:02,150
Pardon me, I didn't catch that.

939
01:41:02,151 --> 01:41:04,087
I didn't say anything, signor.

940
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:07,053
Bravo !

941
01:41:09,991 --> 01:41:11,302
Are you going to give me a cigarette?

942
01:41:11,303 --> 01:41:14,994
We'll be chucking coal a couple hundred years, and all you can say is...

943
01:41:14,994 --> 01:41:17,121
Give me a fucking cigarette, will you?

944
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:24,631
Clown !

945
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:51,955
You asked for it, asshole.

946
01:45:03,324 --> 01:45:07,656
You smoke it.
I don't know how.

947
01:45:13,834 --> 01:45:15,419
Well done !
Bravo !

948
01:45:19,465 --> 01:45:21,467
You're the greatest !

949
01:45:22,677 --> 01:45:23,928
Divine !

950
01:45:33,338 --> 01:45:35,379
Did he win, signor?

951
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,383
Yes, he won.

952
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:39,761
I knew he would, signor!

953
01:46:23,746 --> 01:46:28,117
Jelly Roll Morton spend the rest of
that trip locked in his cabin.

954
01:46:28,403 --> 01:46:33,544
When we got to Southampton, he got off
the Virginian and went back to America.

955
01:46:34,457 --> 01:46:39,156
I remember Nineteen Hundred watched
him as he walked off down the dock.

956
01:46:39,332 --> 01:46:41,064
And all he said was:

957
01:46:41,065 --> 01:46:43,182
Fuck jazz, too!

958
01:46:47,053 --> 01:46:50,537
That's just what he said :
"Fuck jazz,too !"

959
01:46:50,538 --> 01:46:53,132
This is an incredible story.

960
01:46:53,135 --> 01:46:54,641
Did I miss anything important?

961
01:46:54,653 --> 01:46:55,940
You couldn say that.

962
01:46:55,941 --> 01:46:57,012
Damn !

963
01:46:57,013 --> 01:47:00,292
Don't worry, our friend will fill you in later.
Won't you?

964
01:47:00,293 --> 01:47:01,429
You can count on it.

965
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:02,502
Thanks.

966
01:47:02,503 --> 01:47:04,858
He's really good at telling tales.

967
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:08,048
This is no tale, sir.

968
01:47:10,868 --> 01:47:15,498
Yeah, I've done
lots of stupid things in my life.

969
01:47:15,706 --> 01:47:19,515
If you were to hang me upside down
nothing would fall out my pockets.

970
01:47:19,802 --> 01:47:22,822
I even sold my trumpet.
Everything !

971
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:26,735
But not this story,
I haven't lost that.

972
01:47:26,926 --> 01:47:30,935
Now, I've decided to tell it
only because I want to save him.

973
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,128
But there's no-one here. Nobody !
Understand ?

974
01:47:34,517 --> 01:47:37,008
It's because there are
too many of us, we've scared him.

975
01:47:37,009 --> 01:47:40,707
I'm sorry. Now, you leave this ship
or I'll have to have you arrested.

976
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,407
Get back to work. Quickly !

977
01:47:45,104 --> 01:47:46,308
Give me another chance.

978
01:47:46,309 --> 01:47:47,543
Piss off, friend.

979
01:47:47,555 --> 01:47:49,949
Noon tomorrow this ship is history!

980
01:48:04,505 --> 01:48:05,673
And yet....

981
01:48:06,799 --> 01:48:07,959
Here it is.

982
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:10,094
Stop or I'll shoot!

983
01:48:11,442 --> 01:48:12,750
Gotcha.

984
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:15,396
Pops, easy, it's me.

985
01:48:19,537 --> 01:48:21,073
You again? Is it.

986
01:48:21,173 --> 01:48:23,432
Yes, lower that cannon, will you?

987
01:48:23,441 --> 01:48:27,747
Sell your instrument and then steal it back, that's an old trick !

988
01:48:27,847 --> 01:48:29,758
I should have known you're a thief.

989
01:48:29,759 --> 01:48:32,138
No, I was looking for this.

990
01:48:32,139 --> 01:48:33,337
And what do you need that for?

991
01:48:33,725 --> 01:48:35,617
It's a matter of life and death.

992
01:48:35,618 --> 01:48:37,220
And I need a phonograph, too.

993
01:48:37,245 --> 01:48:38,801
A thief and a liar.

994
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:41,031
Look! Pops,
I don't have a whole lot of time here.

995
01:48:41,051 --> 01:48:43,543
Well, I do! Seeing as I have a gun.

996
01:48:44,196 --> 01:48:48,976
And now that I think of it, since when
were records made on board steamships?

997
01:48:50,035 --> 01:48:51,797
Impostor !

998
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,300
If that music really was played by your friend,

999
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:57,296
it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship!

1000
01:48:57,496 --> 01:48:58,705
Correct?

1001
01:48:58,730 --> 01:49:00,297
Not a chance, Pops.

1002
01:49:00,445 --> 01:49:03,479
He cut this passionate recording personally.

1003
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,514
I think it's his best work!

1004
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,924
But he didn't jump ship to do it,
not even for a second.

1005
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:15,252
It was an extraordinary, unique event
in the history of record-making.

1006
01:49:15,253 --> 01:49:18,304
The sky's the limit Mr. Nineteen Hundred.

1007
01:49:18,305 --> 01:49:22,108
If this record sells like hotcakes and we think it will,

1008
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:24,515
you'll go far, Mr. Nineteen.

1009
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,471
Do you mind if I call you Nineteen?

1010
01:49:27,571 --> 01:49:29,172
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

1011
01:49:29,215 --> 01:49:32,394
Ready now, gentelmen.
On the count.

1012
01:49:32,494 --> 01:49:35,883
And one, two, three.

1013
01:52:32,248 --> 01:52:35,189
Oh, Nineteen!

1014
01:52:35,214 --> 01:52:40,585
That is one amazing piece of music.
What is it called?

1015
01:52:41,487 --> 01:52:45,069
It's going to have people crying buckets.

1016
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:48,618
It's got to have the right title though,
something catchy like....

1017
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:51,097
"Swinging in the Breeze" or...

1018
01:52:51,462 --> 01:52:53,853
Great, as usual.

1019
01:52:53,853 --> 01:52:55,451
..."Sweet Nineteen," that's it...

1020
01:52:55,551 --> 01:52:57,836
You're going to be big time.

1021
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,663
And all you got to do is take that big step.

1022
01:53:05,073 --> 01:53:06,526
What big step?

1023
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,069
Getting off.

1024
01:53:08,169 --> 01:53:12,384
Getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after...

1025
01:53:13,009 --> 01:53:16,603
going after your fame and fortune.

1026
01:53:16,692 --> 01:53:20,263
I don't mean to butt in fellas, but...

1027
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:27,907
with this, you can have anything you want
and never have to set foot off this boat.

1028
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:48,275
We'll print millions of copies,

1029
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:53,930
so that people all over the world
can hear your wonderful music, Nineteen.

1030
01:53:55,523 --> 01:53:57,358
Mr Nineteen ?

1031
01:53:57,466 --> 01:54:00,474
I won't let my music
go anywhere without me.

1032
01:54:03,306 --> 01:54:04,992
No! Don't touch.

1033
01:54:04,992 --> 01:54:06,737
What are you doing? You can't do that.

1034
01:54:06,837 --> 01:54:09,593
We have a contract.
You can't go back now.

1035
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:12,046
I always go back.

1036
01:55:15,728 --> 01:55:17,521
Miss,

1037
01:55:20,216 --> 01:55:24,720
I'd be pleased if you...

1038
01:55:36,215 --> 01:55:40,428
Miss, I'd be...

1039
01:55:42,297 --> 01:55:44,507
I'd be thrilled...

1040
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:49,512
if you'd accept this...

1041
01:55:51,597 --> 01:55:54,851
small token...

1042
01:57:11,594 --> 01:57:15,681
Hey, Miss Padoan, what are you doing
here all alone? Counting the waves?

1043
01:57:15,757 --> 01:57:18,879
The captain said we'd be passing
the Tropic of Cancer soon.

1044
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,434
Great! At least we'll have
something to look at.

1045
01:57:21,604 --> 01:57:25,173
You ever notice how the sea changes colors? Ten times a day.

1046
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:29,374
Even more.
I could look at the sea all day long.

1047
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,351
You know farmers don't ever look at the sea.

1048
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:34,067
It scares them At least that's what I heard.

1049
01:57:34,167 --> 01:57:35,919
That's not true.

1050
01:57:36,769 --> 01:57:41,065
Once, my father told me he heard the ocean's voice.

1051
01:57:41,374 --> 01:57:43,842
Really? What did it say?

1052
01:57:44,953 --> 01:57:48,122
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

1053
01:57:48,529 --> 01:57:50,461
And secrets should be kept.

1054
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:53,811
Gosh, it's really coming down now.
Let's get back inside.

1055
01:57:53,812 --> 01:57:55,068
Come on !

1056
01:57:55,682 --> 01:57:57,174
Let me take your arm.

1057
01:58:56,716 --> 01:58:59,064
"Women's dormitory 3 class"

1058
02:03:01,177 --> 02:03:03,179
America

1059
02:03:03,411 --> 02:03:07,561
Damn it,
I wanted to say it !

1060
02:03:36,724 --> 02:03:38,904
Excuse me.

1061
02:03:39,977 --> 02:03:41,390
Excuse me.

1062
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:44,627
Sorry.

1063
02:03:46,492 --> 02:03:48,045
Please, miss.

1064
02:03:51,404 --> 02:03:53,062
I have to talk to you.

1065
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:02,029
You're meeting your father, aren't you?

1066
02:04:02,303 --> 02:04:03,773
Yes.

1067
02:04:04,556 --> 02:04:05,740
How did you know?

1068
02:04:05,765 --> 02:04:07,668
I think I've met him.

1069
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:15,753
On this ship,
quite a few years ago.

1070
02:04:16,102 --> 02:04:18,516
I don't know if he took this same ship.

1071
02:04:19,075 --> 02:04:22,365
I'm sure of it.

1072
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:27,018
He has a musette. Yes?

1073
02:04:28,739 --> 02:04:30,741
I think we played together.

1074
02:04:32,002 --> 02:04:36,632
I don't know if he'd remember,
 but...say hello to him.

1075
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:41,086
All right, I will.

1076
02:04:41,152 --> 02:04:45,531
But how did you know who I was?
It's very strange, no?

1077
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:47,642
It's a secret.

1078
02:04:49,034 --> 02:04:51,911
And secrets should be kept.

1079
02:04:51,988 --> 02:04:54,590
Although I think your father
felt differently back then.

1080
02:04:56,073 --> 02:05:00,153
Come on! Keep moving! Or we'll be here all week to discipline!

1081
02:05:19,582 --> 02:05:23,412
Please accept this...
small musical token.

1082
02:05:23,469 --> 02:05:26,345
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you.

1083
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:33,753
I want you to...
accept this small token.

1084
02:05:34,511 --> 02:05:36,301
I can't hear you.

1085
02:05:41,555 --> 02:05:42,894
Good luck.

1086
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:45,670
Thank you. Good luck to you, too.

1087
02:05:47,121 --> 02:05:49,790
Why don't you come and visit us some day?

1088
02:05:49,795 --> 02:05:52,984
We live on Mott Street. Number 27.

1089
02:05:52,985 --> 02:05:55,145
My father has a fish shop.

1090
02:05:56,173 --> 02:05:57,810
Maybe....

1091
02:06:05,202 --> 02:06:08,626
Padoan, okay. Next.

1092
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:10,221
Next.

1093
02:06:52,466 --> 02:06:56,410
He never mentioned her to me again,
and I never asked.

1094
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:59,465
At least not for
the next twelve crossings.

1095
02:07:00,558 --> 02:07:03,603
Besides, he was happy
just like always.

1096
02:07:03,811 --> 02:07:06,022
His popularity was at its peak.

1097
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:12,953
None of us could have imagined what was smoldering beneath the ashes of his apparent happiness.

1098
02:07:13,863 --> 02:07:18,676
Then, one evening in spring,
halfway between Genoa and New York,

1099
02:07:18,684 --> 02:07:20,895
right in the middle of the ocean,

1100
02:07:20,903 --> 02:07:22,776
the painting fell.

1101
02:07:22,801 --> 02:07:25,622
What do you meaning ? The painting fell?

1102
02:07:25,733 --> 02:07:29,340
Pops, have you ever asked yourself
why paintings fall ?

1103
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:30,215
No, not really.

1104
02:07:30,216 --> 02:07:33,318
I've always been impressed
by this thing about paintings.

1105
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:34,978
What's the painting got to do with this ?

1106
02:07:34,979 --> 02:07:36,079
It does.

1107
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:40,240
Because for Nineteen Hundred, that night
went the way it does for paintings.

1108
02:07:40,813 --> 02:07:46,093
They hang there for years, and then
without any happening...

1109
02:07:46,093 --> 02:07:47,569
Nothing at all...

1110
02:07:49,551 --> 02:07:51,024
Down that come.

1111
02:07:51,543 --> 02:07:54,648
They're hanging there on that nail,
no-body even touches them,

1112
02:07:54,649 --> 02:07:56,624
but at a certain point...

1113
02:07:58,283 --> 02:08:04,242
They fall down anyway,
in the most absolute silence.

1114
02:08:04,445 --> 02:08:09,265
With everything perfectly still
around them.

1115
02:08:10,264 --> 02:08:14,063
Not even a fly moving.

1116
02:08:14,448 --> 02:08:16,668
And they. . .

1117
02:08:19,814 --> 02:08:24,568
There's no reason.
Why in that instant ?

1118
02:08:25,103 --> 02:08:26,739
Who knows ?

1119
02:08:31,065 --> 02:08:34,706
What happens to a nail

1120
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:41,506
to make it decide
that it just can't anymore ?

1121
02:08:43,059 --> 02:08:46,464
Does he have a soul, too,
poor thing ?

1122
02:08:46,698 --> 02:08:48,775
Does he make decisions ?

1123
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:50,590
Sit down....

1124
02:08:51,352 --> 02:08:54,395
Did the nail discuss this at length
with the painting ?

1125
02:08:54,397 --> 02:08:56,119
They were unsure about doing it.

1126
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:58,531
They talked it over every night for years ?

1127
02:08:58,532 --> 02:09:04,496
And then they decide on a date,
a time, a minute, a precise instant ?

1128
02:09:05,521 --> 02:09:10,868
Or they both know it from the beginning?
Both of them was already set up ?

1129
02:09:11,133 --> 02:09:14,480
"Look! I'm letting go in seven years."

1130
02:09:14,483 --> 02:09:15,750
"Fine with me."

1131
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:18,206
"So understand, on May 13."

1132
02:09:18,207 --> 02:09:19,127
"Okay."

1133
02:09:19,127 --> 02:09:20,165
"At twelve o'clock?"

1134
02:09:20,166 --> 02:09:21,846
"How about twelve fifteen."

1135
02:09:21,847 --> 02:09:22,986
"OK."

1136
02:09:22,987 --> 02:09:24,750
"So good night."

1137
02:09:25,634 --> 02:09:28,649
Seven years later,
on May 13,

1138
02:09:28,650 --> 02:09:31,097
at twelve fifteen....

1139
02:09:35,203 --> 02:09:37,098
It's impossible to understand.

1140
02:09:37,099 --> 02:09:39,689
It's one of those things
that probably better not to think about !

1141
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:41,210
Because it makes you nuts.

1142
02:09:41,519 --> 02:09:42,943
Paintings fall,

1143
02:09:43,564 --> 02:09:46,846
when you wake up one morning
and discover she doesn't love you anymore,

1144
02:09:47,157 --> 02:09:50,708
when you open a newspaper
and read that war has broken out,

1145
02:09:50,962 --> 02:09:54,008
when you see a train and
you think: I got to leave this place,

1146
02:09:54,131 --> 02:09:56,494
when you look in a mirror
and realise you're old.

1147
02:09:56,975 --> 02:09:59,637
When one evening, in the middle of the ocean,

1148
02:09:59,737 --> 02:10:07,443
Nineteen Hundred looks up from his plate,
looks me in the eyes and...

1149
02:10:07,697 --> 02:10:10,146
In three days when we get to New York,
I'm getting off this ship.

1150
02:10:13,618 --> 02:10:17,521
I was flabbergasted.

1151
02:10:19,591 --> 02:10:21,593
Cat got your tongue?

1152
02:10:23,378 --> 02:10:27,133
No,I'm glad.

1153
02:10:27,782 --> 02:10:29,867
But all of a sudden?

1154
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,572
All of a sudden.

1155
02:10:34,806 --> 02:10:37,073
My man...

1156
02:10:37,408 --> 02:10:38,675
That's aces.

1157
02:10:38,676 --> 02:10:40,680
I've got to see something down there.

1158
02:10:40,887 --> 02:10:42,015
What ?

1159
02:10:42,016 --> 02:10:43,520
The ocean.

1160
02:10:46,259 --> 02:10:47,543
The ocean ?

1161
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,967
The ocean.

1162
02:10:54,334 --> 02:10:55,935
You're pulling my leg ?

1163
02:10:56,456 --> 02:10:59,553
You've seen nothing but the ocean
since the day you were born.

1164
02:10:59,554 --> 02:11:00,764
But from here.

1165
02:11:02,669 --> 02:11:05,533
I want to see it from there.
It's not the same thing at all.

1166
02:11:05,928 --> 02:11:08,838
Wait till we dock, lean over the side,
take a good look.

1167
02:11:08,839 --> 02:11:10,371
It's the same thing.

1168
02:11:10,925 --> 02:11:12,130
No, it's not.

1169
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,413
From land, you can hear its voice.

1170
02:11:15,513 --> 02:11:17,697
You don't hear that from a ship.

1171
02:11:18,664 --> 02:11:21,244
What do you mean, its voice?

1172
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:22,900
Its voice.

1173
02:11:26,869 --> 02:11:32,617
It's like... a big scream...

1174
02:11:34,341 --> 02:11:38,117
telling you that life is immense.

1175
02:11:38,642 --> 02:11:40,074
Once you've finally heard it,

1176
02:11:40,075 --> 02:11:43,472
then you really know
what you have to do to go on living.

1177
02:11:44,322 --> 02:11:46,762
I could stay here forever,

1178
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:52,540
but the ocean would never tell me a thing.

1179
02:11:53,268 --> 02:11:57,461
But if I get off, live on land for a couple of years,

1180
02:11:57,462 --> 02:12:01,813
then I'll be normal. Just like the others.

1181
02:12:02,381 --> 02:12:06,047
Then maybe one day,
I'll make it to the coast,

1182
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:10,643
look up, see the ocean,
and hear it scream.

1183
02:12:13,653 --> 02:12:18,469
I don't know who's been telling you all this
bullshit or if you're just making it up.

1184
02:12:18,714 --> 02:12:20,915
But you want to know what I think?

1185
02:12:21,817 --> 02:12:23,454
I think...

1186
02:12:24,003 --> 02:12:28,975
the real reason you want off this ship is the girl.

1187
02:12:29,486 --> 02:12:31,654
It's always the girl.

1188
02:12:31,754 --> 02:12:35,999
But even if it's not the reason,
that suits me just fine.

1189
02:12:36,616 --> 02:12:41,811
Because I've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land.

1190
02:12:41,911 --> 02:12:45,382
And marry a nice woman and have children,

1191
02:12:45,482 --> 02:12:50,711
and all those things in life which are not immense

1192
02:12:51,598 --> 02:12:53,912
but are worth the effort.

1193
02:12:55,803 --> 02:12:59,570
You'll come visit me, won't you, Max? On land?

1194
02:13:03,462 --> 02:13:05,499
Of course.

1195
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:11,148
That way, you'll introduce me
to the mother of your children,

1196
02:13:12,439 --> 02:13:15,133
and invite me for Sunday dinner.

1197
02:13:15,581 --> 02:13:18,447
I'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine

1198
02:13:18,448 --> 02:13:21,475
and you'll tell me I shouldn't have.

1199
02:13:21,949 --> 02:13:27,687
And while you're showing me around
your house shaped like a ship,

1200
02:13:28,337 --> 02:13:33,976
your wife will be cooking a turkey.
And then we'll sit at the table.

1201
02:13:34,043 --> 02:13:37,864
And I'll tell her she's an excellent cook,

1202
02:13:37,964 --> 02:13:41,665
and she'll say how you
talk about me all the time.

1203
02:13:45,593 --> 02:13:49,865
You know,
I'm going to give you my camel coat.

1204
02:13:50,441 --> 02:13:53,695
You'll cut a fine figure
when you get down there.

1205
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:00,289
You think I could have a family with a horse ?

1206
02:14:11,923 --> 02:14:13,168
- Nineteen Hundred !
- Hey !

1207
02:14:13,169 --> 02:14:18,300
How many people I have seen saying goodbye
on the docks without giving a damn.

1208
02:14:19,063 --> 02:14:23,899
But when I said goodbye to
Nineteen Hundred, it was a real blow.

1209
02:14:56,486 --> 02:14:58,697
Look after yourself, all right ?

1210
02:15:09,572 --> 02:15:12,036
Take care.

1211
02:15:18,139 --> 02:15:21,184
We laughed,
we kept saying "see you soon",

1212
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:25,959
But inside, we both knew
we'd never see each other again.

1213
02:15:26,214 --> 02:15:30,729
And there was nothing we could do
about it, it had to happen that way.

1214
02:15:30,901 --> 02:15:33,321
And now it was happening.

1215
02:15:54,199 --> 02:15:55,849
How the hell we get off?

1216
02:16:01,829 --> 02:16:04,524
Goodbye, Nineteen Hundred, take care.

1217
02:16:04,524 --> 02:16:06,871
- Bye !
- Don't forget us.

1218
02:16:06,872 --> 02:16:09,642
Remember to wear your
woollen vest in winter.

1219
02:16:09,643 --> 02:16:11,808
Take care Nineteen Hundred, take care.

1220
02:16:11,809 --> 02:16:13,742
Write us a letter sometimes.

1221
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:16,922
- Take care yourself!
- Give my regards to Broadway.

1222
02:16:19,165 --> 02:16:20,547
Good luck !

1223
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:56,801
What'd he do, step in shit?

1224
02:16:57,968 --> 02:16:59,728
Maybe he just forgot something.

1225
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:01,937
Maybe he's forgotten
why he's getting off.

1226
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:16,442
What's he doing ?

1227
02:18:40,475 --> 02:18:44,145
Whatever he saw
from that damned gangplank,

1228
02:18:44,553 --> 02:18:48,877
what kind of thoughts
crossed his mind standing up there,

1229
02:18:48,983 --> 02:18:50,985
he never told me.

1230
02:18:52,792 --> 02:18:56,254
- No, go away !
- Wait !

1231
02:18:56,565 --> 02:19:00,152
I'll give you all the money I have,
take it.

1232
02:19:02,289 --> 02:19:07,974
He was strange for a long time after that.
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

1233
02:19:08,369 --> 02:19:12,999
He preferred keeping to
himself for days and days.

1234
02:19:13,207 --> 02:19:16,848
He seemed taken by very personal matters.

1235
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:20,570
Then, one day,
while I was sitting at the bar...

1236
02:19:20,775 --> 02:19:21,975
Look!

1237
02:19:30,805 --> 02:19:33,418
Thanks for the coat, Max.
Fit like a glove.

1238
02:19:34,737 --> 02:19:36,964
It was a real shame.

1239
02:19:38,441 --> 02:19:42,449
I'm much better now.
I'm done with all that.

1240
02:19:52,656 --> 02:19:55,454
He looked like somebody
who wasn't kidding,

1241
02:19:55,554 --> 02:19:58,605
one who knew
exactly where he was going.

1242
02:19:59,281 --> 02:20:02,511
Like when he'd sit at the piano
and start to play.

1243
02:20:03,293 --> 02:20:05,965
There were no doubts in his hands.

1244
02:20:06,065 --> 02:20:10,449
It was as the keys had been
waiting for those notes forever.

1245
02:20:10,748 --> 02:20:13,859
It seemed like he'd made them up
then and there,

1246
02:20:13,959 --> 02:20:20,109
yet somewhere in his head, those
notes had been written all along.

1247
02:20:20,808 --> 02:20:22,772
Now, I know that on that day,

1248
02:20:22,775 --> 02:20:27,365
Nineteen Hundred had decided to sit before the keyboard of his life

1249
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:30,591
and start playing his most absurd music.

1250
02:20:31,077 --> 02:20:35,670
And this music would have marked the rest of his days.

1251
02:21:31,629 --> 02:21:36,042
Look at that guy with the trumpet,
he's got be drunk or half crazy.

1252
02:21:36,049 --> 02:21:39,042
Look! He's crying as he plays!

1253
02:22:03,547 --> 02:22:08,462
I left the Virginian on
August 21st, 1933,

1254
02:22:08,562 --> 02:22:13,517
with my leave papers and back pay.
Everything in order.

1255
02:22:13,517 --> 02:22:16,632
I knew that sooner or later
I'd have been through with the ocean.

1256
02:22:16,633 --> 02:22:18,827
So that's what I did.

1257
02:22:19,485 --> 02:22:23,383
I heard no more about
Nineteen Hundred or the Virginian.

1258
02:22:23,673 --> 02:22:26,013
Not that I ever forgot them.

1259
02:22:26,113 --> 02:22:27,739
On the contrary.

1260
02:22:28,287 --> 02:22:30,642
During the war, I'd always ask myself...

1261
02:22:31,262 --> 02:22:35,128
Who knows what Nineteen Hundred
would do if he were here?

1262
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:37,316
Who knows what he'd say?

1263
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,794
Fuck war, he'd say.

1264
02:22:39,989 --> 02:22:44,694
But said by me,
it wasn't the same thing.

1265
02:23:05,874 --> 02:23:07,554
A lot of time's gone by, you know.

1266
02:23:08,622 --> 02:23:10,168
Who could say he really didn't leave?

1267
02:23:10,169 --> 02:23:13,777
Maybe one fine day, he went to Mott Street, the fish shop, to ask for the woman.

1268
02:23:15,117 --> 02:23:17,009
Maybe.

1269
02:27:25,658 --> 02:27:30,162
Hey, Conn, what's the matter?
You lose your sea legs?

1270
02:27:33,208 --> 02:27:36,317
Where the hell did you find that record ?

1271
02:27:44,182 --> 02:27:47,051
What have you been up to all these years ?

1272
02:27:53,284 --> 02:27:55,201
Making music.

1273
02:27:55,689 --> 02:27:57,670
Even during the war?

1274
02:28:00,902 --> 02:28:05,019
Even when no one was dancing anymore.

1275
02:28:08,409 --> 02:28:11,028
Even when the bombs were falling.

1276
02:28:14,457 --> 02:28:17,802
The music helped them get better.

1277
02:28:19,196 --> 02:28:21,092
The wounded, I mean.

1278
02:28:25,405 --> 02:28:30,141
Or else it kept them entertained,

1279
02:28:30,673 --> 02:28:34,654
as they slipped away into another world.

1280
02:28:36,846 --> 02:28:41,267
Sometimes they didn't even mind the voyage

1281
02:28:41,776 --> 02:28:44,612
if they could listen to the music.

1282
02:28:47,148 --> 02:28:50,478
Mine was the last face they saw.

1283
02:28:52,178 --> 02:28:57,518
And I kept playing
till the ship got here.

1284
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:04,599
Call this a ship ?

1285
02:29:05,302 --> 02:29:09,358
It's more like a mountain of dynamite about to explode.

1286
02:29:10,088 --> 02:29:12,748
A bit dangerous, don't you think ?

1287
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,633
And you, Max ?

1288
02:29:22,775 --> 02:29:24,360
Where's your trumpet?

1289
02:29:26,896 --> 02:29:29,960
I gave it up as well, a while back.

1290
02:29:30,383 --> 02:29:34,512
But, you know, now I'm in the
mood for starting again.

1291
02:29:35,445 --> 02:29:38,490
I'm busting with new ideas.

1292
02:29:39,634 --> 02:29:42,678
Let's start a duo,
you and me.

1293
02:29:43,638 --> 02:29:46,107
Or our own band :

1294
02:29:46,374 --> 02:29:52,338
The "Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred Big Band !"

1295
02:29:53,056 --> 02:29:57,006
It gets the blood going !
We'd be a smash.

1296
02:30:00,263 --> 02:30:03,577
Come on, Nineteen Hundred.
Come with me. Let's get off.

1297
02:30:04,133 --> 02:30:06,126
We'll watch the fireworks from the pier,

1298
02:30:06,128 --> 02:30:09,172
and then we'll start from scratch.

1299
02:30:10,786 --> 02:30:13,585
Sometimes that's the way you have to do it.

1300
02:30:13,586 --> 02:30:16,637
You go right back to the beginning.

1301
02:30:28,061 --> 02:30:33,782
"You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story

1302
02:30:33,783 --> 02:30:36,486
and someone to tell it to".

1303
02:30:37,148 --> 02:30:38,923
Remember?

1304
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:43,039
You told me that.

1305
02:30:45,659 --> 02:30:49,615
Well, what a stack of stories you got now!

1306
02:30:50,505 --> 02:30:53,373
The world would be hanging
on your every word,

1307
02:30:54,617 --> 02:30:58,168
and they'd go crazy for your music.

1308
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,123
Believe me.

1309
02:31:07,847 --> 02:31:10,308
All that city. . .

1310
02:31:15,539 --> 02:31:19,036
You just couldn't see an end to it.

1311
02:31:20,743 --> 02:31:22,639
The end !

1312
02:31:23,496 --> 02:31:28,547
please?
You please just show me where it ends?

1313
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:35,048
It was all very fine
on that gangway

1314
02:31:35,470 --> 02:31:39,568
and I was grand, too,
in my overcoat.

1315
02:31:40,246 --> 02:31:42,825
I cut quite a figure.

1316
02:31:43,516 --> 02:31:48,706
And I was getting off, Guaranteed.

1317
02:31:49,631 --> 02:31:52,467
That's wasn't the problem.

1318
02:31:56,179 --> 02:31:59,865
It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max.

1319
02:32:00,975 --> 02:32:03,560
It was what I didn't see.

1320
02:32:04,353 --> 02:32:06,374
Can you understand that ?

1321
02:32:08,032 --> 02:32:10,651
What I didn't see.

1322
02:32:11,653 --> 02:32:16,293
In all that srawling city,
there was everything except an end.

1323
02:32:18,043 --> 02:32:20,321
There was no end.

1324
02:32:22,345 --> 02:32:28,312
What I did not see was
where the whole thing came to an end,

1325
02:32:30,321 --> 02:32:32,790
the end of the world.

1326
02:32:39,922 --> 02:32:42,122
You take a piano.

1327
02:32:43,726 --> 02:32:47,893
Keys begin, the keys end.

1328
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:53,474
You know there are 88 of them,
nobody can tell you any different.

1329
02:32:53,828 --> 02:32:58,138
They are not infinite,
you are infinite.

1330
02:32:59,784 --> 02:33:05,013
And on those keys, the music that you can make is infinite.

1331
02:33:05,723 --> 02:33:08,026
I like that.

1332
02:33:08,434 --> 02:33:10,645
That I can live by.

1333
02:33:10,954 --> 02:33:12,584
You get me up on that gangway

1334
02:33:12,584 --> 02:33:13,895
and you roll out in front of me

1335
02:33:13,895 --> 02:33:17,909
a keyboard of millions and billions of keys that never end.

1336
02:33:17,909 --> 02:33:21,481
And that's the truth, Max,
that they never end.

1337
02:33:21,798 --> 02:33:24,375
That keyboard is infinite.

1338
02:33:25,276 --> 02:33:30,406
And if that keyboard is infinite,
then on that keyboard there is no music you can play.

1339
02:33:31,232 --> 02:33:33,885
You're sitting on the wrong bench.

1340
02:33:34,686 --> 02:33:37,264
That's God's piano.

1341
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:45,376
Christ, did you see the streets? Just the streets.
There were thousands of them.

1342
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:49,723
How do you do it down there?
How do you choose just one?

1343
02:33:50,968 --> 02:33:55,568
One woman, one house,

1344
02:33:56,457 --> 02:34:00,825
one piece of land to call your own,
one landscape to look at,

1345
02:34:01,938 --> 02:34:04,547
one way to die.

1346
02:34:07,927 --> 02:34:10,639
All that world just weighing down on you.

1347
02:34:10,639 --> 02:34:12,669
You don't even know where it comes to an end.

1348
02:34:12,769 --> 02:34:16,709
I mean, aren't you ever just scared of breaking apart at the thought of it?

1349
02:34:16,709 --> 02:34:19,813
At the enormity of living it?

1350
02:34:23,835 --> 02:34:26,361
I was born on this ship.

1351
02:34:29,807 --> 02:34:37,228
And the world passed me by,
but two thousand people at a time.

1352
02:34:38,891 --> 02:34:41,728
And there were wishes here,

1353
02:34:43,146 --> 02:34:46,816
but never more than fit between prow and stern.

1354
02:34:48,994 --> 02:34:53,884
You played out your happiness
on a piano that was not infinite.

1355
02:34:54,699 --> 02:34:57,785
I learned to live that way.

1356
02:35:01,314 --> 02:35:03,107
Land?

1357
02:35:05,293 --> 02:35:08,817
Land is a ship too big for me.

1358
02:35:10,999 --> 02:35:14,074
It's a woman too beautiful.

1359
02:35:15,945 --> 02:35:20,785
It's a voyage too long.
Perfume too strong.

1360
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:25,533
It's music I don't know how to make.

1361
02:35:29,058 --> 02:35:32,126
I could never get off this ship.

1362
02:35:35,073 --> 02:35:39,699
At best, I can step off my life.

1363
02:35:41,971 --> 02:35:46,484
After all, I don't exist for anyone.

1364
02:35:50,705 --> 02:35:53,541
You're the exception, Max.

1365
02:35:55,276 --> 02:35:58,520
You're the only one
who knows that I'm here.

1366
02:36:00,615 --> 02:36:03,076
You're a minority.

1367
02:36:03,784 --> 02:36:06,689
And you'd better get used to it.

1368
02:36:11,017 --> 02:36:13,324
Forgive me, my friend.

1369
02:36:14,979 --> 02:36:17,559
But I'm not getting off.

1370
02:37:47,622 --> 02:37:49,207
Hey, Max.

1371
02:37:51,567 --> 02:37:54,116
Picture the scene at the Golden Gates.

1372
02:37:54,528 --> 02:37:58,424
Some guy searching a list trying to find my name, not finding it.

1373
02:37:59,426 --> 02:38:01,656
What did you say your name was again?

1374
02:38:01,756 --> 02:38:03,424
Nineteen Hundred.

1375
02:38:04,622 --> 02:38:09,862
Niemann, Nightingale, Ninestock...
Nittledeen?

1376
02:38:09,962 --> 02:38:12,793
Well, you see, sir. I was born on a ship.

1377
02:38:13,615 --> 02:38:14,719
Beg your pardon?

1378
02:38:14,722 --> 02:38:19,129
Born, raised, and died on a ship.
Maybe I'm not registered there.

1379
02:38:19,229 --> 02:38:22,730
Yeah, Shipwreck ?

1380
02:38:22,830 --> 02:38:25,779
No, six and a half tons of dynamite.

1381
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:30,161
Feeling better now?

1382
02:38:30,261 --> 02:38:34,629
Yeah, I'm fine, except I lost an arm.

1383
02:38:34,929 --> 02:38:36,467
An arm ?

1384
02:38:36,567 --> 02:38:38,978
Yes, in the explosion.

1385
02:38:40,842 --> 02:38:43,073
Well, you should be able to find one over there.

1386
02:38:44,287 --> 02:38:46,602
Which one did you say you were missing?

1387
02:38:46,702 --> 02:38:48,447
Left, sir.

1388
02:38:48,958 --> 02:38:52,844
I'm dreadfully sorry.

1389
02:38:53,729 --> 02:38:57,515
We only seem to have two rights.

1390
02:38:57,615 --> 02:38:58,882
Two right arms?

1391
02:38:58,883 --> 02:39:00,707
Yes.

1392
02:39:00,807 --> 02:39:02,616
Afraid so.

1393
02:39:02,717 --> 02:39:07,007
Would you mind awfully if....

1394
02:39:08,187 --> 02:39:09,623
If I what?

1395
02:39:09,723 --> 02:39:13,789
Well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?

1396
02:39:17,286 --> 02:39:22,828
Well, all things considered, a right arm than nothing, I suppose.

1397
02:39:22,928 --> 02:39:25,246
Couldn't agree more.

1398
02:39:25,598 --> 02:39:30,862
By the way, we have one black arm
and one white arm.

1399
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:33,828
Oh, no.... matching color, please.

1400
02:39:33,828 --> 02:39:39,608
I have nothing against the other race,
but it's just a question of aesthetics.

1401
02:39:43,085 --> 02:39:45,504
No laughing matter, Max.

1402
02:39:47,033 --> 02:39:52,892
What a cock-up, Spend eternity with two right arms?

1403
02:39:53,306 --> 02:39:56,424
I mean, how would you make the sign of the cross?

1404
02:40:11,382 --> 02:40:13,336
Hey, Max.

1405
02:40:14,995 --> 02:40:18,215
Imagine the music I could play with two right arms.

1406
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:22,284
Hope I can find a piano up there.

1407
02:40:29,609 --> 02:40:32,175
Okay, that's fine like that.

1408
02:40:40,041 --> 02:40:44,614
- Slowly.
- Get hold of it there.

1409
02:42:18,301 --> 02:42:20,796
What would you have done in my shoes?

1410
02:42:22,888 --> 02:42:24,890
I don't know.

1411
02:42:27,585 --> 02:42:30,839
I wouldn't probably have felt quite useless.

1412
02:42:38,338 --> 02:42:43,862
Sooner or later all stories end,
and there's nothing left to add.

1413
02:42:49,148 --> 02:42:52,084
Anyhow, thanks, pops.

1414
02:43:13,147 --> 02:43:18,602
Conn, there's just one thing I don't get.

1415
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:23,421
Who hid the broken record inside the piano?

1416
02:43:26,564 --> 02:43:28,305
You're looking at him.

1417
02:43:29,934 --> 02:43:33,938
So you weren't so useless after all.

1418
02:43:42,652 --> 02:43:44,237
Conn.

1419
02:43:48,249 --> 02:43:49,876
Here.

1420
02:43:53,413 --> 02:43:58,167
Take your trumpet.
Well, you'll be needing it.

1421
02:44:00,425 --> 02:44:01,535
But I....

1422
02:44:01,687 --> 02:44:03,439
Never mind the money.

1423
02:44:04,107 --> 02:44:07,505
A good story's worth more than an old trumpet.

1424
02:44:15,159 --> 02:44:17,161
Okay, Pops.
