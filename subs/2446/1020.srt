1
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,676
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,761
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,513
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,766
You there! Is this the last one?

5
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,609
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,778
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,698
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,743
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,579
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,042
Let's coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,366
God!

12
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,788
Glass.

13
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,418
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,629
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,591
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,937
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,025
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,031
Come on. You better take cover.

19
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,870
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

20
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,997
There you go.

21
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,839
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,967
It was no good.

23
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,389
What's going on here?

24
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,516
What's going on here?

25
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,477
That seems to be the question, all right.

26
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,355
See, you could ask the major...

27
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,733
...but he don't know.

28
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,151
He's busy.

29
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,112
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess...

30
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,198
...run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,992
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,286
He come up to see the show.

33
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,413
All he knows is there ain't no show...

34
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,625
...which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up...

35
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,377
...but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,048
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,136
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.

38
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,432
He's thinking to himself,
"I better do something."

39
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,100
You know what that means.

40
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,312
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,899
They're supposed to be beat up just like us.

42
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,486
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,740
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

44
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,910
Course, that's about to change.

45
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,708
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,130
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

47
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,218
...we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

48
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,053
...high-stakes poker.

49
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,055
Wouldn't that be a sight?

50
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,600
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

51
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,977
...drawing cards.

52
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,863
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,406
Looks like a suicide.

54
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,408
Tucker!

55
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,547
What's he doing?

56
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,410
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.

57
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,603
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,983
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

59
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,197
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,912
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,699
- Ready!
- I got him.

62
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,179
Don't...

63
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,267
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,562
You rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.

65
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,565
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

66
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,780
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

67
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,117
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,621
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,693
<i>"The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.</i>

70
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,528
<i>"In trying to produce my own death...</i>

71
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,406
<i>"...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.</i>

72
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,366
<i>"I was also awarded Cisco...</i>

73
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,411
<i>"...the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.</i>

74
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,415
<i>"And on full recovery,
was given transfer to any station I desired.</i>

75
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,419
<i>"The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.</i>

76
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:37,216
<i>"A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie."</i>

77
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,483
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,716
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,384
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,802
Thank you.

81
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,480
"Lt. John J. Dunbar."

82
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,196
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,907
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

84
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,910
Indian fighter.

85
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,162
Excuse me?

86
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,748
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,166
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,752
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,463
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

90
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,423
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."

91
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,640
It says here that you've been decorated.

92
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,016
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,854
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,649
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,609
Really? Why?

96
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,279
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

97
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,365
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,534
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,035
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,545
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

101
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,219
Sir...

102
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,054
...Knight.

103
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,141
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

104
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,728
You will report to Captain Cargill...

105
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,773
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

106
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,942
...Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,155
My personal seal will assure your safety...

108
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,784
...through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,754
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

110
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,925
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?

111
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,636
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,722
- No, sir.
- You think that.

113
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,016
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,685
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,812
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,731
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,735
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,363
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,461
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,509
I've just pissed in my pants...

121
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,096
...and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,279
To your journey!

123
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,702
To my journey!

124
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,596
Haw!

125
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,059
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,438
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,440
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,695
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,949
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,451
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,619
Now!

132
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,000
No.

133
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,336
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

134
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,556
Sir?

135
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,434
Major?

136
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,690
The king is dead.

137
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,238
Long live the king.

138
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,598
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,949
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,497
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,557
The hell was that?

142
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,435
What is that?

143
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,943
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,595
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,857
<i>"Were it not for my companion...</i>

146
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,568
<i>"...I believe I would be having the time of my life.</i>

147
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,027
<i>"I know he means well...</i>

148
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,406
<i>"...but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met."</i>

149
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,276
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,777
Far.

151
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:44,823
How far?

152
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,784
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,996
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,582
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,126
My home.

156
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,009
You ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,766
Look yonder.

158
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,862
What you got there?

159
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,418
Somebody back east is saying,
"Why don't she write?"

160
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,589
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,875
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,005
Get up.

163
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,603
Get up.

Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,320
Get up!

166
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,120
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

167
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,872
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,085
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,328
Cpl. Guest?

170
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,260
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,783
It's the end.

172
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,079

173

But I feel none of the same for you.

You men stayed.

176
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,979
You stayed after they took all our horses.

177
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,692
You stayed after all the others deserted.

178
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,697
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.

179
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:23,412
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...

180
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,080
...just as you have...

181
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,499
...day after miserable day.

182
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,297
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,427
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

184
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,013
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,310
Go.

186
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,145
Get your things.

187
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,270
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,731
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,109
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

190
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:39,530
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

191
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,243
What about Indians?

192
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,662
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,582
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:53,126
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

Ho, up there!

196
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:27,513
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,560
Go down there.

198
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,688
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

199
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,358
Go down there.

200
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,156
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,685
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

Everybody's run off or got killed.

205
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:09,156
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

206
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,159
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,412
I'm staying, too.

208

No, not at the moment.

We don't know what's happened.

211

Things being as they are...

212

just turn around and get headed back.

All right, put it down.

And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon...

- Put it down!

"When I got a pretty wife back home?"

323
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:15,524
You there!

324
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,486
<i>"Have made first contact with a wild Indian.</i>

325
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,740
<i>"One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.</i>

326
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:07,576
<i>"When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.</i>

327
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:12,497
<i>"Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.</i>

328
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:15,709
<i>"Keeping only the barest necessities for myself.</i>

329
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,426
<i>"My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...</i>

330
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,678
<i>"...always keeping the post in sight.</i>

331
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:30,807
<i>"Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.</i>

332
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,477
<i>"Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...</i>

333
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,022
<i>"...but am assuming that where there is one
there's sure to be another.</i>

334
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:42,819
<i>"Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...</i>

335
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,780
<i>"...of strength and stability.</i>

336
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:49,535
<i>"I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...</i>

337
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:51,161
<i>"...all may be lost."</i>

338
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:11,348
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days.

339
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:16,979
I do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone.

340
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:21,567
What does his wife say?

341
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,361
She says that he is keeping to himself.

342
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,947
That's not what I asked you.

343
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,657
Well, what did you ask me?

344
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,826
What did she say?

345
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:34,121
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

346
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:37,374
That's what she says.

347
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,670
Make sure that my meat is soft.

348
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:44,089
My teeth hurt.

349
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,226
May I come in?

350
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:11,909
No, let him sit with me.

351
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,875
Our country seems good this summer...

352
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:24,379
...but I have not been out to see it.

353
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:29,259
But the buffalo are late.

354
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,930
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

355
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,602
I was thinking of a dance.

356
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:42,481
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

357
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:47,819
It would be good to have a strong sign.

358
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,671
There's a funny thing about signs.

359
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:08,340
We know when they are bad or good.

360
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:14,137
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

361
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:17,015
A smart man will think on these things.

362
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:22,145
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

363
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:24,815
For instance, he might tell you or me.

364
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:26,859
A smart man always does this.

365
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:35,367
I have seen such a sign.

366
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:37,911
Really?

367
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,344
I saw a man.

368
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:57,472
A naked, white man.

369
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:59,183
Are you sure it was a man?

370
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:03,604
I saw his sex.

371
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,482
Did you speak to him?

372
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,361
No.

373
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,754
<i>"It's been two days now, and nothing.</i>

374
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,882
<i>"My presence here must
have been reported by now.</i>

375
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:34,843
<i>"Have made all the preparations I can think of.</i>

376
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:37,429
<i>"Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.</i>

377
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:40,182
<i>"But will try to make
a big impression when they come.</i>

378
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:41,558
<i>"Waiting.</i>

379
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:43,352
<i>"Post-script...</i>

380
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,897
<i>"The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow."</i>

381
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:01,620
He might be a god.

382
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:06,583
Or a white chief with special abilities.

383
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:09,002
That is why we should talk with him.

384
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,424
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

385
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:18,345
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

386
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:22,808
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

387
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,185
We took a hundred horses from these people.

388
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:27,646
There was no honor in it.

389
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:30,440
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

390
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:33,318
They're dirty.

391
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,155
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

392
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:40,200
And these people are said to flourish?

393
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,786
I think they will all be dead soon.

394
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,876
I think this fool is probably lost.

395
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:57,926
Wind In His Hair's words are strong
and I have heard them.

396
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,971
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

397
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,433
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

398
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,643
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:10,355
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

400
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:15,194
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:18,697
I see someone who might speak...

402
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,034
...for all the white people who are coming.

403
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:26,413
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

404
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:35,714
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

405
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:39,968
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

406
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:43,805
He is nothing to us.

407
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,641
I will take some men.

408
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,851
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

409
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:51,522
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

410
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:54,358
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

411
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:03,283
No man can tell another what to do.

412
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,745
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

413
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:10,874
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

414
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:20,884
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:23,512
It's hard to know what to do.

416
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:29,017
We should talk about this some more.

417
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,855
That is all I have to say.

418
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:09,808
What's the matter, now?

419
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:12,561
We don't think this is such a good idea.

420
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,647
If we take the horse of a white god...

421
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:17,941
...they will make up songs about us.

422
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:19,943
Maybe.

423
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:23,363
They will ask us to go on raids.

424
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:26,450
Who gets the horse?

425
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:27,534
I do.

426
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:33,957
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

427
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:40,214
It's always the same.

428
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:42,799
Every time.

429
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,683
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.

430
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,669
We'll be heroes.

431
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,007
They'll write songs about us.

432
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:39,189
What happened?

433
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:47,531
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

434
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,871
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

435
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,540
It was your idea.

436
01:05:56,623 --> 01:06:02,087
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

437
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,719
Otter hurt himself.

438
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,932
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

439
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:18,437
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

440
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:45,292
I am Wind In His Hair.

441
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:48,921
I am Wind In His Hair.

442
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:53,342
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

443
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,052
Do you see?

444
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,670
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

445
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:15,799
There are many hearts on the ground.

446
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,605
<i>"I realize now that I have been wrong.</i>

447
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,607
<i>"All this time, I've been waiting.</i>

448
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,234
<i>"Waiting for what?</i>

449
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:58,777
<i>"For someone to find me?</i>

450
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:00,696
<i>"For Indians to take my horse?</i>

451
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,406
<i>"To see a buffalo?</i>

452
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:05,784
<i>"Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.</i>

453
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:08,704
<i>"It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.</i>

454
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:11,206
<i>"Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.</i>

455
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,876
<i>"I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...</i>

456
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:17,546
<i>"...but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.</i>

457
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,423
<i>"I am through waiting."</i>

458
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,426
What are you looking at?

459
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:54,768
Son of a bitch!

460
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:09,032
No. Wait.

461
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:11,201
Wait.

462
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:14,705
Wait.

463
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,751
You need help. You're hurt.

464
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:21,879
- You need...
- No!

465
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,383
Let me... You need help.

466
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:29,720
You need help. You're hurt. Let me help you.

467
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,601
You're hurt.

468
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:41,940
Don't.

469
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:02,516
She's hurt.

470
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,399
She's hurt.

471
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,745
You are not welcome here.

472
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,751
No. She's hurt.

473
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:34,339
Go away from us.

474
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:46,268
You are not welcome. Go away from us.

475
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:30,562
Stop.

476
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:33,857
The soldier did not come to fight.

477
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:37,194
He is going away and we will let him.

478
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:06,014
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.

479
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,560
We will go down and talk to the white man.

480
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,647
And find out why he is here.

481
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:25,826
If this council decides to talk to the white man...

482
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,120
...then it will be so.

483
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,163
But in my mind it's not right...

484
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,040
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...

485
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:35,252
...goes to ask the business of a puny,
trespassing white man...

486
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:40,048
...who has only a smart horse
and a few white man's clothes.

487
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,510
I will not go.

488
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:46,221
You will go.

489
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:54,104
And you will go.

490
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,150
That is all I have to say.

491
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:19,963
Welcome.

492
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:22,174
Welcome.

493
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:25,385
Hi!

494
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:33,685
Come.

495
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:36,188
Please, sit down.

496
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:38,273
Sit down.

497
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:05,217
Wait just a... Just a minute.

498
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:12,391
His mind is gone.

499
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,004
<i>Tatanka. Buffalo.</i>

500
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:44,840
<i>- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.</i>

501
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,183
<i>Buffalo. Tatanka.</i>

502

seems a very tough fellow.</i>

506

507

508
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:15,662
<i>"I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people."</i>

509
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:16,997
Buffalo.

510

<i>"I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before."</i>

512
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,139
Is the coffee not good?

513
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:19,017
It's too strong, maybe.

514
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,105
Sugar.

515
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:25,440
Put in.

516
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:36,493
Taste it.

517
01:24:47,838 --> 01:24:49,006
Sugar.

518
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,550
You want some?

519
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:53,594
You want some?

520
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,101
That's a lot.

521
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:08,483
Okay.

522
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,235
Yeah.

523
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:17,034
<i>"It's good to finally have some company.</i>

524

530
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:10,254
Stands With A Fist.

531
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:16,552
We will talk awhile.

532
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,021
Your wounds are healing well?

533
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:32,109
Yes, they are.

534
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:37,948
You are happy here, with my family?

535
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:40,367
I am glad to be here.

536
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:44,580
I am missing my husband.

537
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:50,377
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

538
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,795
Perhaps.

539
01:26:57,009 --> 01:27:02,222
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

540
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,018
They are coming into everyone's country.

541
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:08,187
I think they will soon be in ours.

542
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,064
This white man
who lives at the old soldier fort...

543
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:14,109
I have visited him
and I believe his heart is a good one.

544
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:23,410
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.

545
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:27,873
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.

546
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:30,292
I am afraid they will try to take me away.

547
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:33,420
I've heard they take people away.

548
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:36,215
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

549
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:39,009
I cannot make the white man language.

550
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:41,345
He cannot speak Sioux.

551
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:45,766
It has been a long time since I made the talk.

552
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,893
I want you to try.

553
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:50,145
I don't know how.

554
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:51,730
Yes, you do.

555
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:53,440
I can't.

556
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:56,944
I can't. It's dead in me.

557
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:02,407
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

558
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:05,619
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

559
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:08,080
Now, you must remember.

560
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,460
I can't.

561
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,349
Will she make the white words?

562
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:31,353
She won't try. She is being difficult.

563
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:34,523
Well, she's the one who's crying.

564
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:37,985
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

565
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:45,719
<i>Christine!</i>

566
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:03,570
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!

567
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:08,909
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

568
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:16,667
Damn!

569
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,920
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

570
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:22,422
Go on!

Christine! Where are you?

573
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:33,475
I'm up here, mother.

574
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:35,477
- Get down now.
- Why?

575
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:36,937
Just do it.

576
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:48,615
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

577
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:51,952
Joe, get in the house right now!

578
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:00,127
Willie!

579
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:04,173
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

580
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:07,176
My father and your father are talking to them.

581
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,470
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

582
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:13,891
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

583
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:28,488
Run, Christine!

584
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:30,824
I said run!

585
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:34,953
Joe!

586
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:52,304

587

He should have a real name.

801
02:21:43,754 --> 02:21:48,091
<i>"It is autumn now and I am spending
more time than ever with my friends.</i>

802
02:21:48,133 --> 02:21:51,762
<i>"They have given me
my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.</i>

803
02:21:51,845 --> 02:21:55,891
<i>"We talk every day,
but I know Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.</i>

804
02:21:55,974 --> 02:21:59,436
<i>"He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.</i>

805
02:21:59,645 --> 02:22:04,358
<i>"I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.</i>

806
02:22:04,525 --> 02:22:06,652
<i>"But I am speaking in half-truths.</i>

807
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:11,365
<i>"One day there will be too many,
but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.</i>

808
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:14,743
<i>"I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back...</i>

809
02:22:15,035 --> 02:22:17,538
<i>"...but to her credit, she says nothing."</i>

810
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:50,571
<i>"A war party is going against the Pawnee soon
and I have asked to go.</i>

811
02:22:50,696 --> 02:22:52,865
<i>"I sense I made a mistake in doing so...</i>

812
02:22:52,948 --> 02:22:55,826
<i>"...but I could not bring myself to take it back.</i>

813
02:22:55,868 --> 02:22:58,579
<i>"They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...</i>

814
02:22:58,662 --> 02:23:01,164
<i>"...the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.</i>

815
02:23:01,248 --> 02:23:03,959
<i>"I hope I have not overstepped my bounds."</i>

816
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:09,965
Come in, please.

817
02:23:12,426 --> 02:23:13,677
Sit down?

818
02:23:17,181 --> 02:23:19,266
Kicking Bird want to know...

819
02:23:19,349 --> 02:23:22,936
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

820
02:23:23,562 --> 02:23:26,273
They have done nothing to you.

821
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,817
They are Sioux enemies.

822
02:23:36,366 --> 02:23:39,119
Only Sioux warriors to go.

823
02:23:40,078 --> 02:23:41,955
Tell him that I have been a warrior...

824
02:23:42,039 --> 02:23:45,375
...Ionger than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

825
02:23:45,834 --> 02:23:47,085
Tell him.

826
02:24:01,683 --> 02:24:04,937
He said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...

827
02:24:05,020 --> 02:24:06,939
...is not the white way.

828
02:24:07,523 --> 02:24:11,568
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand.

829
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:14,196
Tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.

830
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:23,789
He also asks that you...

831
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:28,252
...watch over his family while he is gone.

832
02:24:29,253 --> 02:24:33,006
This thing he asks is a great honor for you.

833
02:24:36,552 --> 02:24:40,472
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

834
02:24:46,895 --> 02:24:49,648
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

835
02:24:51,149 --> 02:24:53,151
Who is Dances With Wolves?

836
02:24:55,112 --> 02:24:58,615
It is the name which all the people...

837
02:24:58,699 --> 02:25:00,492
...are calling you now.

838
02:25:01,034 --> 02:25:02,536
Dances With...

839
02:25:03,996 --> 02:25:05,497
That's right.

840
02:25:05,914 --> 02:25:07,207
That day.

841
02:25:08,458 --> 02:25:10,127
Dances With Wolves.

842
02:25:11,795 --> 02:25:13,463
How do you say it?

843
02:26:13,232 --> 02:26:18,695
Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.

844
02:26:18,779 --> 02:26:21,240
I like to make the talk.

845
02:27:01,864 --> 02:27:03,115
I'm here.

846
02:27:06,285 --> 02:27:07,703
We walk.

847
02:27:40,819 --> 02:27:42,362
I cut this off.

848
02:27:43,363 --> 02:27:45,657
I shaved it off. More.

849
02:27:47,826 --> 02:27:49,953
Grass grows on the prairie.

850
02:27:49,995 --> 02:27:51,496
"Grass grows on the prairie"?

851
02:27:53,749 --> 02:27:55,209
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

852
02:27:55,292 --> 02:27:57,461
You said, "Fire lives on the prairie."

853
02:27:57,503 --> 02:27:58,754
I did?

854
02:27:59,421 --> 02:28:02,382
No laughing, though.

855
02:28:06,386 --> 02:28:09,223
That man is a fighter.

856
02:28:13,477 --> 02:28:14,686
Again.

857
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:18,857
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

858
02:28:22,528 --> 02:28:23,654
Yes.

859
02:28:31,078 --> 02:28:32,829
<i>Hoo hoo, right?</i>

860
02:28:38,377 --> 02:28:39,336
No?

861
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,805
Try this.

862
02:28:52,057 --> 02:28:53,725
What's the word...

863
02:28:54,268 --> 02:28:55,811
...for beautiful?

864
02:29:01,066 --> 02:29:03,318
What are you doing?

865
02:29:03,402 --> 02:29:07,155
It's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.

866
02:29:11,577 --> 02:29:13,579
I'm hungry.

867
02:29:31,346 --> 02:29:34,057
How is Dances With Wolves?

868
02:29:36,143 --> 02:29:38,312
What do you mean?

869
02:29:39,521 --> 02:29:42,065
How is he learning?

870
02:29:42,858 --> 02:29:46,570
He is a fast learner.

871
02:29:46,653 --> 02:29:49,531
What did you think I meant?

872
02:30:09,676 --> 02:30:11,803
You go for water, today?

873
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:19,686
Then let us take you.

874
02:30:34,993 --> 02:30:37,037
How did you get your name?

875
02:30:41,333 --> 02:30:44,253
I was not very old...

876
02:30:45,212 --> 02:30:47,673
...when I came to be with the people.

877
02:30:48,507 --> 02:30:50,425
And I was made to work.

878
02:30:51,552 --> 02:30:53,679
I worked every day, very hard.

879
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:58,809
There was a woman...

880
02:30:58,851 --> 02:31:00,853
...who didn't like me much.

881
02:31:02,437 --> 02:31:06,525
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

882
02:31:11,113 --> 02:31:12,364
Beat me?

883
02:31:16,368 --> 02:31:18,120
And one day, she was...

884
02:31:18,954 --> 02:31:21,164
...calling me these bad names...

885
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:24,084
...with her face in my face...

886
02:31:25,043 --> 02:31:26,378
...and I hit her.

887
02:31:28,338 --> 02:31:31,466
I was not very big, but she fell down.

888
02:31:31,717 --> 02:31:33,927
She fell hard and didn't move.

889
02:31:35,345 --> 02:31:38,724
And then I stood over her with my fist...

890
02:31:38,932 --> 02:31:40,267
...and I asked if...

891
02:31:40,684 --> 02:31:42,978
...there was any other woman...

892
02:31:43,562 --> 02:31:45,856
...who wanted to call me bad names.

893
02:31:47,774 --> 02:31:50,194
No one bothered me after that day.

894
02:31:53,238 --> 02:31:56,241
No, I wouldn't think so.

895
02:32:01,330 --> 02:32:02,706
Show me.

896
02:32:03,749 --> 02:32:05,751
Show me where you hit her.

897
02:32:34,488 --> 02:32:36,448
Why are you not married?

898
02:32:40,494 --> 02:32:41,995
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

899
02:32:44,915 --> 02:32:46,250
I'm sorry.

900
02:32:48,418 --> 02:32:49,586
Can I help you?

901
02:33:19,908 --> 02:33:22,744
You are not talking today?

902
02:33:22,828 --> 02:33:24,538
No, I am not.

903
02:34:30,896 --> 02:34:37,027
Some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast.

904
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:42,407
So what can I tell you today?

905
02:34:43,617 --> 02:34:45,953
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.

906
02:34:46,036 --> 02:34:49,122
Why is there no man with her?

907
02:34:50,499 --> 02:34:53,210
She is in mourning.

908
02:34:55,754 --> 02:34:56,922
I don't...

909
02:34:58,257 --> 02:35:01,802
I do not understand "mourning."

910
02:35:03,345 --> 02:35:05,764
She cries for someone.

911
02:35:07,975 --> 02:35:10,394
Cries for who?

912
02:35:14,147 --> 02:35:17,025
It is not polite to speak of the dead.

913
02:35:17,109 --> 02:35:21,071
But you are new, so I will tell you.

914
02:35:21,154 --> 02:35:23,448
She cries for her husband.

915
02:35:23,490 --> 02:35:25,617
He was killed not long ago.

916
02:35:25,701 --> 02:35:30,330
That is how you came to find her on the prairie.

917
02:35:33,709 --> 02:35:37,629
How long will she cry?

918
02:35:39,548 --> 02:35:44,469
It is Kicking Bird's place
to say when she is finished.

919
02:35:44,803 --> 02:35:48,432
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

920
02:36:06,158 --> 02:36:09,119
People are talking about you.

921
02:36:11,788 --> 02:36:13,832
What are they saying?

922
02:36:16,543 --> 02:36:18,754
They are proud of the medicine...

923
02:36:18,837 --> 02:36:22,299
...you are making with Dances With Wolves.

924
02:36:25,135 --> 02:36:29,431
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.

925
02:36:30,516 --> 02:36:33,227
You can't. He is gone.

926
02:36:34,061 --> 02:36:36,313
He left this morning.

927
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:03,418
Bet you were thinking:

928
02:39:03,502 --> 02:39:05,504
"Now, why don't he write?"

929
02:39:06,338 --> 02:39:08,006
Hello, Two Socks.

930
02:39:35,492 --> 02:39:36,743
Come on.

931
02:39:41,373 --> 02:39:44,960
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.

932
02:39:45,335 --> 02:39:46,962
You can do this.

933
02:39:51,341 --> 02:39:52,509
Come on.

934
02:40:04,646 --> 02:40:06,106
This is easy.

935
02:40:06,648 --> 02:40:08,567
This is easy, Two Socks.

936
02:41:29,982 --> 02:41:31,650
I am in mourning.

937
02:41:40,993 --> 02:41:42,494
No, we cannot.

938
02:41:42,786 --> 02:41:45,706
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

939
02:41:47,749 --> 02:41:49,168
We must be careful.

940
02:41:49,251 --> 02:41:50,711
Okay.

941
02:42:54,525 --> 02:42:55,609
Wait!

942
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:02,945
What?

943
02:45:03,779 --> 02:45:04,988
Trouble.

944
02:45:28,637 --> 02:45:32,057
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

945
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:34,643
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

946
02:45:34,768 --> 02:45:38,814
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

947
02:45:38,897 --> 02:45:41,775
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

948
02:45:41,859 --> 02:45:43,819
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

949
02:45:45,737 --> 02:45:46,947
I will get them.

950
02:45:47,698 --> 02:45:49,616
Stone Calf, wait.

951
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:50,784
I have guns.

952
02:45:50,868 --> 02:45:53,328
I have many rifles.

953
02:45:55,497 --> 02:45:57,624
- At the fort?
- Yes.

954
02:45:58,333 --> 02:46:00,878
No. The ride is long and we can spare no men.

955
02:46:00,961 --> 02:46:04,089
Guns would make one warrior like two.

956
02:46:09,511 --> 02:46:12,723
Take one man and go quickly.

957
02:46:13,807 --> 02:46:16,351
I will take Smiles A Lot.

958
02:49:42,099 --> 02:49:43,600
Shoot the gun!

959
02:54:11,410 --> 02:54:13,537
<i>"It was hard to know how to feel.</i>

960
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:16,206
<i>"I'd never been in a battle like this one.</i>

961
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:18,959
<i>"There was no dark political objective.</i>

962
02:54:19,042 --> 02:54:23,046
<i>"This was not a fight for territory or riches
or to make men free.</i>

963
02:54:23,130 --> 02:54:27,050
<i>"It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.</i>

964
02:54:27,092 --> 02:54:31,555
<i>"To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.</i>

965
02:54:31,805 --> 02:54:35,475
<i>"Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...</i>

966
02:54:35,559 --> 02:54:37,519
<i>"...such a one-sided victory.</i>

967
02:54:37,603 --> 02:54:40,564
<i>"And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.</i>

968
02:54:40,772 --> 02:54:43,317
<i>"I felt a pride I'd never felt before.</i>

969
02:54:44,109 --> 02:54:46,945
<i>"I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.</i>

970
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:49,823
<i>"Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.</i>

971
02:54:49,907 --> 02:54:53,076
<i>"But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...</i>

972
02:54:53,118 --> 02:54:55,996
<i>"...I knew for the first time who I really was."</i>

973
02:56:18,954 --> 02:56:22,958
When we were younger,
he always bragged about how brave he was.

974
02:56:23,041 --> 02:56:26,503
And what a great chief he would make.

975
02:56:26,587 --> 02:56:28,881
He thought I was impressed.

976
02:56:28,964 --> 02:56:33,552
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo.

977
02:56:33,635 --> 02:56:37,222
And the first thing this brave warrior did
is run for a tree.

978
02:56:39,892 --> 02:56:41,894
He would have forgotten all about me...

979
02:56:41,935 --> 02:56:44,062
...if he hadn't needed my help to climb it.

980
02:56:44,146 --> 02:56:48,775
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below.

981
02:56:48,859 --> 02:56:51,737
Making loud noises
and hitting her head against the trunk.

982
02:57:02,831 --> 02:57:06,710
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

983
02:57:06,752 --> 02:57:09,254
Horseback's games are always good.

984
02:57:10,589 --> 02:57:15,093
I'm tired.
Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.

985
02:57:18,597 --> 02:57:20,474
Good night.

986
02:58:03,642 --> 02:58:06,728
How long will Stands With A Fist mourn?

987
02:58:07,521 --> 02:58:09,481
I don't know.

988
02:58:13,151 --> 02:58:16,280
I hope it will not be too long.

989
02:58:18,866 --> 02:58:20,951
Has something happened?

990
02:58:21,577 --> 02:58:23,203
What?

991
02:58:24,037 --> 02:58:26,832
She has found love again.

992
02:58:27,875 --> 02:58:29,877
With who?

993
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:31,461
Who do you think?

994
02:58:31,503 --> 02:58:32,796
Tell me.

995
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:35,215
Dances With Wolves.

996
02:58:38,177 --> 02:58:40,137
Are you certain of this?

997
02:58:40,971 --> 02:58:44,725
When you see them together, you will know.

998
02:58:46,435 --> 02:58:48,478
What are people saying?

999
02:58:49,188 --> 02:58:51,273
They like the match.

1000
02:58:56,361 --> 02:58:58,488
No one is angry?

1001
02:58:58,572 --> 02:59:02,618
It makes sense. They are both white.

1002
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:08,832
I suppose I will be the one to say something.

1003
02:59:09,708 --> 02:59:12,336
She's your daughter now.

1004
02:59:12,836 --> 02:59:14,796
I know.

1005
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:24,181
Relax. You can't see everything coming.

1006
02:59:24,890 --> 02:59:28,227
Stop it. Quit your playing.

1007
02:59:41,949 --> 02:59:43,617
Stands With A Fist.

1008
02:59:44,910 --> 02:59:47,454
You will mourn no more.

1009
03:00:07,766 --> 03:00:10,352
Sit, sit.

1010
03:00:16,441 --> 03:00:19,486
There's talk that you want to get married.

1011
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,156
To who?

1012
03:00:23,907 --> 03:00:25,993
To Stands With A Fist.

1013
03:00:26,076 --> 03:00:27,995
That's the one, isn't it?

1014
03:00:28,078 --> 03:00:29,288
She's in mourning.

1015
03:00:29,371 --> 03:00:30,831
Not today.

1016
03:00:30,914 --> 03:00:33,709
Kicking Bird has released her.

1017
03:00:33,792 --> 03:00:35,752
He did?

1018
03:00:36,128 --> 03:00:38,297
What are you doing here?

1019
03:00:39,590 --> 03:00:42,759
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

1020
03:00:44,511 --> 03:00:46,763
You might have to wait a long time.

1021
03:00:46,805 --> 03:00:50,934
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird
riding on the prairie.

1022
03:00:52,394 --> 03:00:55,480
He says he was talking to himself.

1023
03:00:55,564 --> 03:00:57,107
A medicine man takes it pretty hard...

1024
03:00:57,149 --> 03:00:59,151
...when he is the last to know something.

1025
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:03,572
What do I do?

1026
03:01:06,742 --> 03:01:10,954
You are pretty poor
and a Sioux girl is not for free.

1027
03:01:10,996 --> 03:01:13,540
I don't know if you can get married.

1028
03:01:18,295 --> 03:01:20,297
I have the buckskin...

1029
03:01:20,339 --> 03:01:21,882
No, that's too much medicine.

1030
03:01:24,343 --> 03:01:28,764
Do you think my horse is too much medicine?

1031
03:01:30,682 --> 03:01:33,185
For a girl.

1032
03:01:37,606 --> 03:01:41,485
Wait here. Maybe we can help you.

1033
03:01:41,568 --> 03:01:43,237
Wait.

1034
03:01:45,447 --> 03:01:47,407
That's all I do is wait!

1035
03:02:08,220 --> 03:02:11,932
<i>"The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.</i>

1036
03:02:12,057 --> 03:02:15,018
<i>"The generosity of the people was astonishing.</i>

1037
03:02:15,060 --> 03:02:18,438
<i>"The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.</i>

1038
03:02:18,564 --> 03:02:22,901
<i>"Even the poorer families
wanted to give up animals they could not afford.</i>

1039
03:02:23,026 --> 03:02:25,237
<i>"It was hard to turn them away.</i>

1040
03:02:29,950 --> 03:02:31,994
<i>"Black Shawl was a mystery.</i>

1041
03:02:32,744 --> 03:02:36,248
<i>"I couldn't guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice...</i>

1042
03:02:36,748 --> 03:02:38,792
<i>"...no words of encouragement.</i>

1043
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:46,925
<i>"I may have been the brunt of an inside joke...</i>

1044
03:02:47,009 --> 03:02:49,344
<i>"...that included the entire village...</i>

1045
03:02:49,469 --> 03:02:51,305
<i>"...but I was determined.</i>

1046
03:02:54,641 --> 03:02:58,061
<i>"Wind In His Hair told me
if all the gifts were gone in the morning...</i>

1047
03:02:58,103 --> 03:03:00,230
<i>"...my offer had been accepted.</i>

1048
03:03:01,273 --> 03:03:05,527
<i>"I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.</i>

1049
03:03:06,445 --> 03:03:09,781
<i>"I had no idea
what Kicking Bird's decision would be."</i>

1050
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,723
Turn around.

1051
03:03:36,808 --> 03:03:39,186
You look good.

1052
03:03:39,269 --> 03:03:42,314
You know, the man she mourned for...

1053
03:03:42,397 --> 03:03:45,192
He was my best friend.

1054
03:03:46,985 --> 03:03:49,112
I didn't know that.

1055
03:03:51,615 --> 03:03:53,700
He was a good man.

1056
03:03:54,326 --> 03:03:57,496
It has been hard for me to like you.

1057
03:03:58,956 --> 03:04:02,376
I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is.

1058
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:04,878
I always feel anger first.

1059
03:04:04,962 --> 03:04:07,631
There were no answers to my questions.

1060
03:04:07,673 --> 03:04:12,886
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

1061
03:04:12,970 --> 03:04:15,264
That is how I see it.

1062
03:04:39,371 --> 03:04:41,999
This is a good day for me.

1063
03:04:43,917 --> 03:04:45,294
And for me.

1064
03:04:48,797 --> 03:04:52,509
If you want this man, take his hand in yours.

1065
03:05:07,316 --> 03:05:09,401
<i>"I had never been married before.</i>

1066

have the same experience...</i>

1067
03:05:12,487 --> 03:05:16,867

what was expected of a Sioux husband...</i>

1068
03:05:16,909 --> 03:05:20,704
<i>"...my mind began to swim
in a way that shut out everything but her...</i>

1069
03:05:20,746 --> 03:05:23,040
<i>"...the tiny details of her costume...</i>

1070
03:05:23,123 --> 03:05:25,209
<i>"...the contours of her shape...</i>

1071
03:05:25,459 --> 03:05:27,377
<i>"...the light in her eyes...</i>

1072
03:05:27,544 --> 03:05:29,588

<i>"I knew that the love
between us would be served."</i>

1074

Have you heard all that I have said?

1075
03:05:44,603 --> 03:05:45,604
Yes.

1076
03:05:47,439 --> 03:05:51,151
Good, then take her inside.

1077
03:05:51,235 --> 03:05:52,945
She is your wife.

1078
03:05:55,364 --> 03:05:56,657
Good.

1079
03:05:58,158 --> 03:06:00,619
Thank you.

1080
03:06:07,251 --> 03:06:08,293
Bye.

1081
03:06:13,715 --> 03:06:14,758
Bye.

1082
03:06:58,886 --> 03:07:02,472
Dances With Wolves' door
is closed a lot these days.

1083
03:07:02,556 --> 03:07:06,518
I think they're having trouble making a baby.

1084
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:09,897
I don't think they're having trouble at all.

1085
03:07:13,859 --> 03:07:17,321
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

1086
03:07:42,387 --> 03:07:46,225
Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

1087
03:07:48,894 --> 03:07:53,023
Today I am riding away to a far away place.

1088
03:07:53,106 --> 03:07:55,275
I would like you to ride with me.

1089
03:08:10,999 --> 03:08:13,210
It's good to be out.

1090
03:08:14,211 --> 03:08:16,588
Yes, it must be.

1091
03:08:17,756 --> 03:08:20,133
We are trying for a baby.

1092
03:08:21,510 --> 03:08:23,220
No waiting?

1093
03:08:23,804 --> 03:08:25,556
No waiting.

1094
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:34,273
I was just thinking
that of all the trails in this life...

1095
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:38,235
...there is one that matters most.

1096
03:08:38,318 --> 03:08:41,613
It is the trail of a true human being.

1097
03:08:42,906 --> 03:08:47,369
I think you are on this trail, and it is good to see.

1098
03:09:07,306 --> 03:09:09,808
We call you the Busy Bee.

1099
03:09:45,844 --> 03:09:49,681
It is said that all the animals were born here.

1100
03:09:49,765 --> 03:09:53,977
That from here they spread over the prairies
to feed all the people.

1101
03:09:54,603 --> 03:09:58,148
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

1102
03:10:49,283 --> 03:10:51,034
It's quiet here.

1103
03:12:51,071 --> 03:12:53,657
We must wait for these people.

1104
03:12:54,992 --> 03:12:58,745
No, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.

1105
03:13:01,373 --> 03:13:04,668
We will water the horses and go home.

1106
03:13:51,006 --> 03:13:54,801
You always ask about the white people.

1107
03:13:56,595 --> 03:13:58,764
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

1108
03:14:01,099 --> 03:14:03,769
There will be a lot, my friend.

1109
03:14:03,852 --> 03:14:05,604
More than can be counted.

1110
03:14:08,148 --> 03:14:09,399
How many?

1111
03:14:12,110 --> 03:14:13,612
Like the stars.

1112
03:14:27,960 --> 03:14:31,922
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

1113
03:14:39,304 --> 03:14:42,099
We should tell this to Ten Bears.

1114
03:15:08,584 --> 03:15:10,627
The men who wore this came...

1115
03:15:10,711 --> 03:15:13,589
...in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.

1116
03:15:14,173 --> 03:15:16,884
Eventually we drove them out.

1117
03:15:17,634 --> 03:15:21,346
Then the Mexicans came.
They do not come here anymore.

1118
03:15:21,763 --> 03:15:24,808
In my own time, the Texans.

1119
03:15:24,850 --> 03:15:27,394
They have been like all the others.

1120
03:15:30,439 --> 03:15:35,152
They take without asking.

1121
03:15:36,111 --> 03:15:39,907
I don't know if we are ready for these people.

1122
03:15:41,366 --> 03:15:45,913
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

1123
03:15:47,164 --> 03:15:49,625
When I think of that, I look at this helmet.

1124
03:15:52,169 --> 03:15:56,298
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

1125
03:15:57,382 --> 03:15:59,426
Tomorrow we will strike the village...

1126
03:15:59,510 --> 03:16:01,845
...and go to the winter camp.

1127
03:16:33,043 --> 03:16:35,838
You have everything from the soldier fort?

1128
03:16:36,088 --> 03:16:37,130
Yes.

1129
03:16:37,464 --> 03:16:39,591
There's nothing for me there.

1130
03:16:40,551 --> 03:16:41,969
That's good.

1131
03:16:55,566 --> 03:16:56,942
The journal.

1132
03:16:59,194 --> 03:17:00,904
Stands With... Wait!

1133
03:17:01,280 --> 03:17:02,447
Words are important!

1134
03:17:02,531 --> 03:17:04,908
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

1135
03:17:04,950 --> 03:17:08,745
Now, it tells everything about my life here.
I must get it.

1136
03:17:08,954 --> 03:17:10,122
Enough.

1137
03:17:10,205 --> 03:17:12,791
We cannot wait for you.

1138
03:17:24,678 --> 03:17:26,889
I'll catch up.

1139
03:18:08,514 --> 03:18:09,640
Injun!

1140
03:18:10,057 --> 03:18:11,558
Get him! Injun!

1141
03:18:17,189 --> 03:18:18,190
No!

1142
03:18:39,795 --> 03:18:42,005
Stay down. Stay.

1143
03:18:42,381 --> 03:18:43,799
My God.

1144
03:18:44,466 --> 03:18:45,717
God.

1145
03:18:51,390 --> 03:18:52,641
It's okay.

1146
03:19:34,933 --> 03:19:36,476
Something has happened.

1147
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:39,146
Dances With Wolves is not coming.

1148
03:19:39,771 --> 03:19:41,773
He must have trouble.

1149
03:19:43,442 --> 03:19:48,780
Pick two good men
and send them back to the soldier fort.

1150
03:20:00,584 --> 03:20:01,960
Spivey.

1151
03:20:02,836 --> 03:20:05,047
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

1152
03:20:06,131 --> 03:20:08,342
Tell the major he's waking up.

1153
03:20:10,260 --> 03:20:12,179
Move your worthless ass.

1154
03:20:23,732 --> 03:20:25,776
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

1155
03:20:26,568 --> 03:20:27,861
...didn't you?

1156
03:20:27,945 --> 03:20:30,030
Major's coming through.

1157
03:20:40,123 --> 03:20:42,000
Does he speak English?

1158
03:20:42,167 --> 03:20:43,794
I don't know, sir.

1159
03:20:45,587 --> 03:20:47,381
Speak English?

1160
03:20:49,174 --> 03:20:51,760
Talk English? Talk!

1161
03:20:53,512 --> 03:20:55,138
I speak English.

1162
03:20:59,685 --> 03:21:01,061
Who are you?

1163
03:21:03,230 --> 03:21:07,442
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

1164
03:21:08,026 --> 03:21:09,736
Why are you dressed like this?

1165
03:21:11,989 --> 03:21:15,826
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1166
03:21:16,410 --> 03:21:18,412
Do you have proof of that?

1167
03:21:20,956 --> 03:21:25,252
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

1168
03:21:25,335 --> 03:21:27,462
It will tell you everything.

1169
03:21:27,754 --> 03:21:30,382
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1170
03:21:30,465 --> 03:21:32,801
Did you find anything? A journal?

1171
03:21:33,135 --> 03:21:35,470
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

1172
03:21:35,888 --> 03:21:37,472
Where's Edwards?

1173
03:21:37,973 --> 03:21:39,433
He's outside.

1174
03:21:44,062 --> 03:21:46,481
He didn't find nothing either.

1175
03:21:50,694 --> 03:21:53,030
Somebody find me Edwards.

1176
03:22:01,788 --> 03:22:03,498
You turned Injun, didn't you?

1177
03:22:08,587 --> 03:22:09,963
Didn't you?

1178
03:22:14,635 --> 03:22:16,887
What did you say your name was?

1179
03:22:17,596 --> 03:22:18,764
Dunbar.

1180
03:22:19,848 --> 03:22:22,267
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1181
03:22:22,351 --> 03:22:24,353
You say you're an officer?

1182
03:22:24,603 --> 03:22:28,440
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

1183
03:22:29,107 --> 03:22:31,193
They're in my journal.

1184
03:22:31,443 --> 03:22:33,153
There are no orders.

1185
03:22:33,612 --> 03:22:35,364
There's no journal.

1186
03:22:39,785 --> 03:22:41,828
Why are you out of uniform?

1187
03:22:44,206 --> 03:22:45,958
I have to relieve myself.

1188
03:22:49,169 --> 03:22:51,922
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

1189
03:22:53,549 --> 03:22:54,758
Let's go.

1190
03:22:58,762 --> 03:23:00,931
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.

1191
03:23:01,723 --> 03:23:04,726
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

1192
03:23:04,810 --> 03:23:06,645
Do you salute him or shoot him?

1193
03:23:15,654 --> 03:23:17,531
Here, you. Eyes front.

1194
03:23:23,412 --> 03:23:25,038
I said eyes front!

1195
03:23:27,082 --> 03:23:29,543
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

1196
03:23:29,626 --> 03:23:30,919
Get him!

1197
03:24:21,386 --> 03:24:23,388
Why are you out of uniform?

1198
03:24:27,392 --> 03:24:28,894
What's the army doing out here?

1199
03:24:29,937 --> 03:24:32,523
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.

1200
03:24:38,779 --> 03:24:41,114
We're charged with apprehending...

1201
03:24:44,034 --> 03:24:47,496
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

1202
03:24:47,579 --> 03:24:50,374
...retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1203
03:24:50,457 --> 03:24:54,419
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

1204
03:24:54,503 --> 03:24:57,548
If you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

1205
03:24:57,589 --> 03:25:00,008
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1206
03:25:00,509 --> 03:25:02,553
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...

1207
03:25:02,594 --> 03:25:05,889
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

1208
03:25:05,973 --> 03:25:08,725
...to cooperate with the United States Army.

1209
03:25:10,519 --> 03:25:12,855
There's nothing for you to do out here.

1210
03:25:16,483 --> 03:25:18,986
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

1211
03:25:21,738 --> 03:25:23,240
Speak up!

1212
03:25:27,035 --> 03:25:30,414
I am Dances With Wolves.

1213
03:25:32,583 --> 03:25:33,458
What's that?

1214
03:25:36,295 --> 03:25:38,964
I have nothing to say to you.

1215
03:25:39,047 --> 03:25:42,259
You are not worth talking to.

1216
03:25:52,269 --> 03:25:55,939
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

1217
03:25:56,815 --> 03:25:59,651
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

1218
03:26:01,737 --> 03:26:03,238
Not you, Spivey.

1219
03:26:31,308 --> 03:26:32,643
Lieutenant.

1220
03:26:35,229 --> 03:26:37,189
Major wants to see you.

1221
03:27:11,473 --> 03:27:12,891
Spivey.

1222
03:27:17,896 --> 03:27:19,940
Spivey. You got paper?

1223
03:27:20,566 --> 03:27:24,027
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

1224
03:27:24,403 --> 03:27:25,445
Can you read?

1225
03:27:25,612 --> 03:27:27,823
No, I can't read. What the hell's the difference?

1226
03:27:27,906 --> 03:27:30,868
You can't read either. Now just give me some.

1227
03:27:31,368 --> 03:27:35,205
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

1228
03:28:57,329 --> 03:28:58,497
Bauer!

1229
03:29:02,125 --> 03:29:03,418
Let go of me!

1230
03:29:11,677 --> 03:29:14,555
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

1231
03:29:17,307 --> 03:29:19,059
You son of a bitch!

1232
03:29:21,979 --> 03:29:23,480
It's all right.

1233
03:29:24,189 --> 03:29:25,732
It's all right.

1234
03:29:26,316 --> 03:29:30,487
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.

1235
03:29:31,280 --> 03:29:34,283
Word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.

1236
03:29:34,366 --> 03:29:37,035
And once you get there, they gonna hang you.

1237
03:29:40,706 --> 03:29:43,709
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1238
03:29:58,807 --> 03:29:59,975
Get up in there!

1239
03:30:25,959 --> 03:30:27,961
Spivey, what is that?

1240
03:30:28,378 --> 03:30:30,547
Looks like he's following us.

1241
03:30:30,797 --> 03:30:32,549
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1242
03:30:33,675 --> 03:30:34,843
Dang. You missed him.

1243
03:30:35,886 --> 03:30:38,805
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

1244
03:30:38,889 --> 03:30:40,724
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

1245
03:30:40,807 --> 03:30:42,559
He ain't even moving.

1246
03:30:43,101 --> 03:30:46,730
- Wait a minute! That's my shot.
- Shoot him!

1247
03:30:47,814 --> 03:30:50,275
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

1248
03:30:50,734 --> 03:30:51,610
Shoot him!

1249
03:30:54,947 --> 03:30:57,032
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

1250
03:31:01,620 --> 03:31:03,455
Bauer, get him off him!

1251
03:31:10,254 --> 03:31:11,797
He might have killed you.

1252
03:31:19,638 --> 03:31:21,139
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1253
03:31:27,729 --> 03:31:29,398
Sit down, goddamn it!

1254
03:31:41,743 --> 03:31:43,328
That's it. I got him!

1255
03:31:46,832 --> 03:31:48,959
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

1256
03:31:50,377 --> 03:31:51,920
Son of a bitch!

1257
03:31:52,504 --> 03:31:53,714
Get up!

1258
03:31:55,382 --> 03:31:56,466
Get up!

1259
03:31:58,010 --> 03:31:59,803
I mean it! Get up!

1260
03:31:59,887 --> 03:32:01,889
Get up! Come on, get up!

1261
03:32:02,431 --> 03:32:03,473
What?

1262
03:32:03,557 --> 03:32:06,810
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1263
03:32:07,853 --> 03:32:10,022
You men get back here!

1264
03:32:13,650 --> 03:32:15,027
Goddamn it!

1265
03:32:53,690 --> 03:32:54,608
Boo.

1266
03:33:03,158 --> 03:33:05,452
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1267
03:33:09,665 --> 03:33:11,416
All right. Let's go.

1268
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:36,233
I don't see nobody.

1269
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:56,170
Indians!

1270
03:37:38,809 --> 03:37:39,768
No.

1271
03:40:28,353 --> 03:40:33,025
Dances With Wolves is quiet these days.

1272
03:40:34,776 --> 03:40:37,279
Is his heart bad?

1273
03:40:46,371 --> 03:40:49,583
Killing the soldiers at the river...

1274
03:40:52,044 --> 03:40:54,254
...was a good thing.

1275
03:40:55,130 --> 03:40:58,050
I did not mind killing those men.
I was glad to do it.

1276
03:41:02,054 --> 03:41:07,809
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

1277
03:41:08,936 --> 03:41:12,231
They think I am a traitor.

1278
03:41:16,902 --> 03:41:20,322
And they will hunt for me.

1279
03:41:20,405 --> 03:41:24,618
And when they find me, they find you.

1280
03:41:26,078 --> 03:41:31,959
I think it would be wise to move the village now.

1281
03:41:38,924 --> 03:41:41,176
I will be leaving.

1282
03:41:43,595 --> 03:41:47,599
I must go and talk with those who would listen.

1283
03:41:56,441 --> 03:41:59,319
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

1284
03:42:09,288 --> 03:42:11,957
Leave us alone.

1285
03:42:29,766 --> 03:42:33,812
You are the only white man I have ever known.

1286
03:42:33,896 --> 03:42:37,858
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

1287
03:42:37,941 --> 03:42:41,737
But I think you are wrong.

1288
03:42:42,654 --> 03:42:45,741
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

1289
03:42:45,824 --> 03:42:52,247
Now there is only a Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

1290
03:42:56,168 --> 03:42:58,420
Let's smoke awhile.

1291
03:43:04,051 --> 03:43:06,887
<i>"With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.</i>

1292
03:43:06,970 --> 03:43:10,766
<i>"There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.</i>

1293
03:43:10,849 --> 03:43:12,518
<i>"But I was sure of myself.</i>

1294
03:43:12,601 --> 03:43:16,772
<i>"I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.</i>

1295
03:43:16,855 --> 03:43:19,525
<i>"I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...</i>

1296
03:43:19,608 --> 03:43:22,986
<i>"...but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.</i>

1297
03:43:23,070 --> 03:43:27,324
<i>"He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.</i>

1298
03:43:27,741 --> 03:43:30,160
<i>"Ten Bears was an extraordinary man."</i>

1299
03:44:11,493 --> 03:44:13,370
You have nothing to say?

1300
03:44:15,747 --> 03:44:17,541
What can I tell you?

1301
03:44:19,209 --> 03:44:21,170
What's ever on your mind.

1302
03:44:27,801 --> 03:44:29,803
You've made the decision.

1303
03:44:34,266 --> 03:44:36,059
My place is with you.

1304
03:44:37,019 --> 03:44:38,687
I go where you go.

1305
03:44:42,232 --> 03:44:43,901
You're not afraid?

1306
03:44:44,985 --> 03:44:46,028
No.

1307
03:44:49,489 --> 03:44:52,576
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

1308
03:44:59,708 --> 03:45:01,585
Did you tell everyone?

1309
03:45:05,631 --> 03:45:07,090
Not everyone.

1310
03:45:43,627 --> 03:45:45,879
It's all right.

1311
03:46:18,787 --> 03:46:20,163
You...

1312
03:46:21,206 --> 03:46:22,749
...finish your pipe?

1313
03:46:35,888 --> 03:46:37,181
Good pipe.

1314
03:46:38,682 --> 03:46:40,017
How...

1315
03:46:40,559 --> 03:46:41,935
...does it smoke?

1316
03:46:45,063 --> 03:46:46,607
I've never smoked it.

1317
03:46:58,410 --> 03:46:59,786
We come far...

1318
03:47:00,204 --> 03:47:01,538
...you and me.

1319
03:47:04,249 --> 03:47:06,126
I will not forget you.

1320
03:48:54,693 --> 03:48:57,321
Dances With Wolves.

1321
03:48:58,447 --> 03:49:01,116
I am Wind In His Hair.

1322
03:49:01,200 --> 03:49:04,703
Do you see that I am your friend?

1323
03:49:08,707 --> 03:49:11,960
Can you see that you will always be my friend?

1324
03:49:15,740 --> 03:49:18,740
Dances with wolves...

1325
03:49:20,740 --> 03:49:23,740
Dances with wolves...

1326
03:49:25,740 --> 03:49:29,740
Dances with wolves...

1327
03:49:35,740 --> 03:49:39,740
Dances with wolves...

1328
03:49:50,740 --> 03:49:53,740
Dances with wolves...

1329
03:50:39,631 --> 03:50:41,633
Sergeant! Over here! Now!

1330
03:51:28,222 --> 03:51:36,813
Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed,
their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux

1331
03:51:36,897 --> 03:51:44,738
submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson,
Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains

1332
03:51:44,821 --> 03:51:49,743
was gone and the American frontier was soon
to pass into history.
