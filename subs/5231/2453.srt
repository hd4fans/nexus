3
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,850
- 就搬一个箱子啊?  - 是易碎的办公用品
- Just one box?  - It's for my office. It's fragile.

4
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,103
胆小鬼
Sissy.

5
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,016
嘿 伙计 摘掉耳机
Hey, dude, headphones.

6
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,276
你这么下去会聋掉的
You're gonna go deaf!

7
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,433
亲笔签名?
An autograph?

8
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,314
- 我就是想...  - 开什么玩笑?
- I just thought that...  - Are you kidding me?

9
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,366
女士?
Ma'am?

10
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,616
- 警长  - 你丈夫在吗?
- Sheriff.  - Your husband around?

11
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,332
艾希莉?
Ashley?

12
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,285
艾希莉?
Ashley?

13
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,704
亲爱的
Honey.

14
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,497
小甜心
Sweetheart.

15
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,338
- 你在做什么呢?  - 画画
- What are you doing?  - Painting.

16
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,003
看到了 你妈妈需要你帮忙收拾
Yeah. I know. I think your mom wants your help unpacking.

17
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,297
我知道
I know.

18
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,849
那就出来吧 你可以晚点继续画
So come outside. You can finish your painting later.

19
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,886
又不是我想搬到这儿来 我才不去搬箱子
I didn't wanna move here. I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

20
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,228
我们必须搬到这里 而且每个人都应该搬箱子
We had to move here and we all have to help carry boxes.

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,769
- 呃 是你想搬来的  - 不 是我必须搬来
- Uh-uh. You wanted to move here.  - No, I had to move here.

22
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,233
我的新故事以这里为背景
The new story I'm writing is here.

23
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,524
为什么不在老房子里写作?
Why can't you just keep writing in the old house?

24
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,365
因为我必须靠编写大学教材才能负担得起老房子
'Cause I was gonna have to write college textbooks to pay for that old house.

25
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,121
- 我不想那样  - 为什么呢?
- And I can't do that.  - Why not?

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,625
- 因为不想  - 可是我很怀念我的学校
- 'Cause I just can't.  - But I miss my school.

27
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,003
你知道吗? 这里的学校很漂亮
Well, you know what? The school here is supposed to be pretty great.

28
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,130
可是我喜欢以前的学校
But I want my old one.

29
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,420
这样行吗? 等我的书卖出去
I know. How about this, all right? I'll tell you what.

30
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,132
要是我们还不喜欢这里 咱们就搬回老房子
If we don't like it here, once I sell my book, we'll move back.

31
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,802
前提是我们不喜欢这里
But only if we don't like it here.

32
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,016
- 真的吗?  - 真的
- Really?  - Really.

33
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,271
你发誓?
You promise?

34
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,400
我发誓 不过你要试着接受这里
I promise. But you have to promise to try to like it here.

35
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,481
- 一言为定  - 说定了? 我的艺术家
- I promise.  - You do? Now, my little artist.

36
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,442
- 第一条规定是什么?  - 只许在卧室墙壁画画
- What's the number one rule?  - Paint only goes in the bedroom.

37
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,733
- 哪里不许画画?  - 卧室以外的地方都不许
- Where doesn't it go?  - Anywhere else in the house.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,819
好了 现在我们去搬箱子吧
Right. OK, now, come with me. Move some boxes.

39
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,948
警长来了
Sheriff's here.

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,085
- 这么快就到了?  - 这回客气点
- Already?  - Play nice this time.

41
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,745
- 我一直很客气的  - 我是认真的
- I'm always nice.  - I'm not kidding.

42
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,132
我可不想每小时行驶5公里都被开罚单
I'm tired of driving five miles under the speed limit to get ticketed anyway.

43
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,634
一定要客气
Be nice.

44
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,055
下午好 请问有事吗?
Afternoon. Is there a problem?

45
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,262
没有 就是来问个好
No, sir. Just a friendly visit.

46
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,347
非常感谢 我是埃里森・奥斯华
I appreciate that. Ellison Oswalt.

47
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,138
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

48
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,807
- 看来你不是我的粉丝喽  - 当然不是
- So you're not a fan.  - No.

49
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,476
请问我能为你做些什么呢?
Well, what can I do for you?

50
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,692
也没什么 我只是想劝你
Well, not much, I expect, unless I can convince you

51
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,280
赶快收拾东西走人
to load those boxes back on that truck and leave as soon as you're able.

52
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,365
我可不想这么做
No, I don't think so, but, you know what.

53
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,826
不过 我还有一些"肯塔基州血案"的复本
I do have a couple of extra copies of Kentucky Blood,

54
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,366
如果你想要签名的话
if you want me to get one out and sign it for you.

55
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,582
- 谢谢 不必了 先生  - 是我的小说的原因?
- No, thank you, sir.  - Is it the writing?

56
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,420
是你写的内容 不太尊重我们的行业
More a matter of content. You don't seem to care much for our profession.

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,960
你的同事也不尽然都是对的
Not everybody in your profession gets it right.

58
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,595
我看过你的书 你也不是全对
I've read your books. Neither do you.

59
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,971
- 听我说...  - 你在"肯塔基州血案"中判断是对的
- Look...  - You got it right in Kentucky Blood.

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,307
这个我承认 那是本不错的书
I'll give you that. It's a fine piece of writing.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,349
但是在"丹佛清晨"中 你错了
But Cold Denver Morning, you got it wrong.

62
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,893
- 血腥晚餐...  - 听我说好吗? 这不是我的错
- Blood Diner...  - Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?

63
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,732
你的谬论帮助了一个杀人犯逃脱 毁了别人的生活
Your bad theory helped a killer go free. You ruined people's lives.

64
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,777
现在 这个小镇不需要那些了 它需要的是忘记痛苦 恢复生机
Now, this town doesn't need that. It needs to heal. It needs to forget.

65
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,492
我们不想你把我们的生活搅得一团糟
We sure don't want that circus that you bring with you.

66
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,531
这里有个女孩失踪了
Well, there's a missing girl involved here.

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,669
- 她没有失踪 她是死掉了  - 拜托 不是这样的
- She ain't missing. She's dead.  - Come on. You don't know that.

68
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,372
如果她还活着 
If that girl is still alive, then it ain't no miracle

69
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,006
我们怎么会一直找不到她
and we ain't ever gonna find her.

70
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,542
难道就这样坐视不理了吗?
Then I guess we should just let it go, huh?

71
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,054
你不觉得还欠小镇人民一个交代吗?
You don't think the town deserves an explanation?

72
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,592
这样的事... 这样的事永远解释不清
Something like this... You can never explain something like this.

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,772
就算你能解释 你也不太在乎得出的答案
And if you were able to, the odds are you wouldn't much care for the answer.

74
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,228
我们工作很尽职 你会了解的
Now, we did our job. You'll see that.

75
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,988
你现在是在浪费时间 就跟你的上两本书一样
And this is just another waste of your time like your last two books.

76
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,566
记录真实的犯罪案件让我明白一件事
If writing true crime has taught me one thing.

77
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,203
就是当警官告诉我是在浪费时间的时候
It's that whenever an officer of the law tells me that I'm wasting my time,

78
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,784
其实是他觉得在浪费自己的时间
it just means he thinks he's wasting his.

79
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,826
聪明 你应该把这句写到小说里
That's clever. You ought to write that down.

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,586
我大胆的推测一下
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb

81
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,123
你的人员是不会帮我一把了?
and assume your department is not at my disposal?

82
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,886
知道吗? 有时候你也可能判断正确
Well, what do you know? You can still get things right on occasion.

83
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,980
哦 我... 我觉得这里的真的不咋地
Oh, and... I find this to be in extremely bad taste.

84
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,866
- 是什么事情啊?  - 没什么事
- What was all that about?  - The usual.

85
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,323
他想要签名 不过他忘记拿书了
He wanted an autograph, but he left his copy at home.

86
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,204
- 他等一下再过来  - 这么糟糕啊?
- He'll be back later.  - That bad?

87
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,786
- 嗯  - 他为何对着房子指指点点的?
- Mm-hm.  - Why was he pointing at the house?

88
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,959
埃里森 我们不会又搬进了案发现场附近了吧?
Ellison, we didn't move in a few houses down from a crime scene again, did we?

89
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,631
- 特蕾西...  - 不要告诉我
- Tracy...  - No, just don't say anything.

90
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,884
就算是 我也不想知道
If we did, I don't wanna know about it.

91
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,550
- 没有  - 你发誓?
- We didn't.  - You promise?

92
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,259
我发誓
I promise.

93
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,848
帮把手 把这个搬到厨房 
Here. Make yourself useful, Kitchen.

94
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,231
这里很不错 等着瞧吧
It's gonna be good here, OK? You'll see.

95
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,979
妈的
Shit.

96
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,036
哦 靠
Oh, shit.

97
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,014
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

98
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,483
家庭出游 11分钟?
Family Hanging Out, '11?

99
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,234
家庭烧烤 79分钟?
Barbeque, '79?

100
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,667
我还做了面条和幸运甜饼
I've also got noodles and fortune cookies.

101
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,999
好好享受吧 孩子们 我们不能像以前那样经常出去吃了
Enjoy, kids. We're not likely to be able to eat out much this time.

102
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,664
- 哦!  - 为什么?
- Oh!  - Why not?

103
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,082
- 你懂的  - 我不懂
- You know why.  - I don't.

104
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,750
我们还没把老房子卖掉
We haven't sold the old house yet.

105
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,636
只有卖掉它 我们才有富余的钱
Once it's gone, well be able to afford a few extra things.

106
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,093
那就降低价格出卖呗
Then sell it already. Lower the price if you have to.

107
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
我们已经降的很低了
We've already lowered it as much as we can.

108
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,061
市场不景气 当我们不用付两份房贷时 就能好过一点
The market's terrible. Once we're not paying two mortgages, we'll be fine.

109
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,939
等我的新书大卖 我们就能走上小康之路了
And once I sell my new book, we'll be on Easy Street.

110
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,193
- 这次的故事不错吧?  - 是的 当然不错
- Is the story a good one this time?  - Yeah, it's good. Of course it is.

111
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,611
- 能告诉我故事发生在哪里吗?  - 特雷弗 别问了
- Will you show me where it happened?  - Trevor.

112
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,443
我已经长大了 可以接受这些
I'm old enough to know about this stuff.

113
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,279
不 还不可以 连我都还没强大到能接受这些
No, you are not. Even I'm not old enough to know about this stuff.

114
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,115
你父亲写的是非常 非常恐怖的故事
Your father writes about terrible, terrible things.

115
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,746
- 那我不应该写这些喽?  - 我不是这个意思
- I shouldn't be writing about it?  - That's not what I meant.

116
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,578
你就是这个意思
That's the way you said it.

117
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,663
反正我也会在学校听到的
I'm gonna hear about it at school anyway.

118
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,420
同学们都讨厌我 还会不停告诉我发生了什么
Kids'll all hate me again and tell me nonstop what happened.

119
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,502
- 嘿 没人讨厌你  - 与其这样 我还不如听你说
- Hey, nobody hates you.  - I might as well hear it from you.

120
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,088
- 你有听我说话吗?  - 我在听
- Are you listening to this?  - Yes. I'm listening.

121
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,345
要确保你的办公室是锁上的
Let's at least make sure your office stays locked.

122
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,551
听到是一回事 看见是另一回事
It's one thing to hear about it, another to see it.

123
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,465
我不想他再进你办公室 他才12岁
I don't want him walking in again. He's 12.

124
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,427
- 老妈 爸爸知道我多大了  - 嘿 别吵了
- Mom, he knows how old I am.  - Hey, stop it.

125
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,847
- 第一条规则是什么来着?  - 不许进老爸办公室
- What's the first rule?  - Never go in Dad's office.

126
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,265
那我们的规则是什么?
And what's the rule?

127
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,980
- 办公室一直锁上  - 没错
- Always lock Dad's office.  - That's right.

128
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,238
还有 我不希望再听到有人问我们为何搬到这里
And I don't wanna hear another thing about why we're here, from anybody.

129
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,568
好的 
Yeah.

130
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,574
你还没刷牙呢
You didn't brush your teeth.

131
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,789
- 还没  - 还不睡觉吗?
- No. not yet.  - You're not coming to bed?

132
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,877
不睡 我要去整理一下办公室 然后开工
No, I thought I'd set up my office first and get started.

133
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,212
- 要多久?  - 也就一两个小时
- How long is it gonna be?  - Just an hour or two.

134
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,970
不 我是指... 我们要在这里住多久?
No, I mean... how long are we here for this time?

135
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,804
哦 我不知道 可能很久
Oh, God. I don't know. It could be a long one.

136
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,014
我还是喜欢你写小说的日子
I liked it better when you were writing fiction.

137
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,181
- 可是没人喜欢我的小说  - 或许你应该在尝试一次
- Nobody likes my fiction.  - Maybe you should try again.

138
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,020
没你的支持我无法继续
I can't do this without you by my side.

139
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,232
抱歉 我一直支持你
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm on your side.

140
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,857
我只是希望你能开心工作
I just wanna see you enjoying your work again.

141
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,616
你开心... 我们就都开心了
When you're happy... we're all happy.

142
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,952
我需要创造另一个巅峰之作 仅此而已 
I just need another hit, that's all.

143
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,164
- 就一次  - 我只是...
- Just one more.  - I just...

144
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,252
什么?
What?

145
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,508
- 你知道我支持你  - 我知道
- You know I'm behind you on this.  - I know.

146
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,591
但这不是你想说的 你想要说什么?
But that's not what you were gonna say. What were you gonna say?

147
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,848
"肯塔基州血案"是10年前的事情了
Kentucky Blood was ten years ago.

148
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,474
然后呢?
And?

149
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,434
要是... 那只是你短暂的人生高点呢?
And... what if that was your 15 minutes?

150
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,813
就算是 那会怎样?
OK, what if it was?

151
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:11,106
如果是 你也不能一辈子都想着超越它
If it was, you can't just spend the rest of your life chasing after it.

152
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,196
如果你错过了这些年和孩子们在一起的时光 你是无法挽回的
If you miss out on these years with the kids, you won't get them back.

153
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,487
我需要个机会 就一次
I just need one more chance, that's all, one more.

154
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,327
- 好吧  - 这次我很有灵感
- OK. good.  - I got a good feeling about this.

155
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,455
不过 埃里 以后我可不想再过这样的日子了
But, Ell, I don't think I can do this again.

156
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,666
- 亲爱的 以后不会再这样了  - 我是认真的
- Honey, you're not gonna have to.  - No. I mean it.

157
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,129
要是这回还像上次一样无果而终
If this goes sour like last time.

158
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,091
我就把特雷弗和艾希莉带到我姐姐家去 
I'll take Trevor and Ashley and go back home to my sister's.

159
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,634
- 这样不过分吧?  - 不过分
- Is that fair?  - Yes.

160
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,189
这次不会搞砸的
But it's not gonna go sour.

161
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,602
好的 好好干
Good. Now go kick some arse.

162
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,663
什么情况? 放出来看看吧
What the hell? Let's do this.

163
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,740
好的
All right.

164
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:22,126
"是谁录下来的?"
"WHO MADE THE FILM?"

165
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:40,629
"斯蒂芬妮 去哪儿了?"
"WHERE'S STEPHANIE?"

166
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,940
你为什么要录下来呢?
Why would you film it?

167
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,774
老爸 我找不到浴室了
Daddy, I can't find the bathroom.

168
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,731
这边走 我领你去...
Come here. Come on. Come on. We'll get you...

169
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,663
谢谢老爸
Thank you, Daddy.

170
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,835
看看你的新作品 你画的越来越棒了
Look at all these new paintings. You're really getting good.

171
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,753
谢谢 也许有一天我能画出很棒的作品
Thank you. Maybe one day I'll paint something really good.

172
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,010
- 然后我就能像你一样出名了  - 你会的 我的公主
- Then I'll be famous like you.  - I'm sure you will, princess.

173
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,510
- 好了 睡觉吧  - 好的
- All right, get some sleep.  - OK.

174
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,810
- 还有 老爸?  - 什么事?
- And Daddy?  - Yes?

175
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,476
你这次能写出很好的书 然后我们能回家吗?
Are you gonna write a really good book this time so we can go home?

176
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,693
我会写出最最棒的书
I'm gonna write the best book that anyone's ever read.

177
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,634

天啊 他没事吧?
Oh, my God, is he OK?

192
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,468
快醒过来 没事了 我们出来了
Come on, open up. Here we go. Come outside.

Look at the stars. Trevor. Trevor, Trevor.

197
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,979
- 我们怎么在外面?  - 没事了 孩子 没事了
- Why are we outside?  - All right, bud. OK.

198
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,739
你做噩梦了 是吧? 是夜惊导致的
You were having a bad dream, OK? One of those night terrors.

199
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,946
- 回去睡觉吧  - 我还以为他好了
- Just go back to sleep.  - I thought these were over.

200
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,368
换新环境导致的 我发现他进到箱子里去了
It's just the stress of the move. I found him in one of the moving boxes.

201
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,952
可怜的孩子
Poor baby.

202
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,459
过几个小时就好了
He'll be all right in a few hours.

203
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,378
哦 特蕾西 我...
Oh. Oh, Tracy. I...

204

怎么了? 发生什么了?
What is it? What's the matter?

205
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,169
我想... 我有话对你说
I wanna... I wanna tell you something.

206
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,133
说吧
OK.

207
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,935
真的很抱歉
I'm just really sorry.

208
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:58,645
这不是你的错 进屋吧 外面冷
It's not your fault. Come on. It's cold. Let's go inside.

209
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,034
我在箱子里啊?
I was in a box?

210
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,412
- 没错  - 我什么都不记得了
- You were in a box.  - I don't remember any of that.

211
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,868
你还进过更离谱的东西呢
It's not the strangest place we've ever found you.

212
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,499
别再提烘干机那事儿了
Please don't talk about the dryer.

213
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,661
是特雷弗想在烘干机撒尿那次吗?
Are we talking about the time we found Trevor trying to pee in the dryer?

214
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,670
- 天啊 老妈 别说了  - 抱歉 亲爱的
- God, Mom, no.  - I'm sorry, honey.

215
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,877
我以为你们在谈论这个呢
I thought that's what you were talking about.

216
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,792
特雷弗又想到烘干机里撒尿了?
Did Trevor try to pee in the dryer again?

217
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,677
- 妈妈  - 不是 你哥哥是有些夜惊
- Mom.  - No. Your brother had a night terror.

218
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,134
- 是做噩梦吗?  - 差不多
- Is that like a bad dream?  - Kind of.

219
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,425
哦 我觉得我也做恶梦了
Oh, I think I had one of those.

220
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,094
不会的 夜惊是一种很特殊的噩梦
No, a night terror is a special kind of bad dream.

221
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,265
你有的话我们会记得的 别乱扔东西 坐好了
We would have remembered if you had one. Don't do that. You can sit right here.

222
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,810
艾希莉 第一天到新学校上学兴奋吗?
So, Ashley, you excited about your first day at the new school?

223

224
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,069
真高兴你们很喜欢这次冒险经历
It's nice to see you're both so enthusiastic about our adventure.

225
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,985
- 别闹了  - 嘿 你们两个别闹了
- Stop it.  - Hey, you two stop it. Stop it.

226
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,370
你送他们去学校吗?
Be the bigger person. Are you gonna take 'em?

227
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,031
是的 我还有些事情要办
Yeah, I've got some errands to run.

228
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,076
我想得熟悉下地形 让你安心工作
I figured I'd get the lay of the land and let you get some work done.

229
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,620
- 快吃 你们要迟到了  - 听到老妈的话没
- Eat up. You're running late.  - You heard your mother.

230
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,538
拿着早餐在路上吃吧
Grab some road breakfast and skedaddle.

231
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,583
- 我给你煮了一壶咖啡  - 谢谢
- I left you a fresh pot of coffee.  - Thanks.

232
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,751
祝你找到谋杀案头绪
Have a nice morning with your murder victims.

233
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:08,965
- 会的 亲爱的  - 走了
- Yes. dear.  - Come on.

234
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,756
- 特雷弗 你的笔记本呢?  - 应该在我的包里
- Trevor, where's your notebook?  - It should be in my backpack.

235
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,016
包里有吗?
Can you see it in there?

236
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,222
不是吧
Oh, fuck.

237
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,776
没错 就是它
That's it. OK.

238
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:42,244
"超级8胶片1966年由伊斯门柯达制造"
"Super 8 film was first released in 1966 by Eastman Kodak."

239
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,496
好了
OK.

240
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,294

241
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,479

Trevor, don't walk away from me. Ashley, close the door.

242
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,639
特雷弗 你到底在想什么?
Trevor, what on earth were you thinking?

243
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,309
我重申一次 我什么都没想
I'll tell you again. I wasn't thinking.

244
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,444
这就是你的问题所在 你不思考
That's your problem. You don't think.

245
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,231
你想要我们把你当成人年 可你的表现很不成熟
You wanna be treated like an adult, but you don't act like one.

246
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,025
你和老爸倒是思考很多 如果有用的话 我们也不用搬到这里了
You and Dad do lots of thinking. If you did, we wouldn't be here.

247
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,944
你在胡说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

248
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,750
- 我比你知道的多  - 马上回卧室!
- I know more than you.  - Go to your room!

249
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,872
- 晚饭前不许出来  - 好啊
- I don't wanna see you until dinner.  - Fine.

250
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,783
- 嘿 嘿 嘿 怎么了?  - 老妈反应过火了
- Hey. Hey. Hey.What happened?  - Mom's overreacting.

251
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,917
- 你儿子又出岔子了  - 他做了什么?
- Your son is acting out again.  - What did he do?

252
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,957
- 你总是站到她那边 不是吗?  - 嘿 你到底做了什么?
- You're automatically taking her side?  - Hey, stop it. What did you do?

253
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,169
我画了一幅画
I drew a picture.

254
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,176
他在教室白板上用马克笔画了一幅画
A picture with a permanent marker on the classroom whiteboard.

255
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,087
- 天啊 不是吧 特雷弗?  - 告诉你老爸你画的是什么
- Oh, God. Trevor?  - Tell him what you drew.

256
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,006
- 我画了一棵树  - 还有四个人吊在上面
- I drew a tree.  - With four people hanging from it.

257
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,803
回你卧室去 特雷弗 我要和你老爸谈谈
Go to your room, Trevor. I need to speak to your father.

258
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,595
这可是他第一天上学啊 埃里森
His first day at school, Ellison,

259
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,311
他听到你关于凶案的细节了吗?
and he's already hearing the grisly details of your mystery?

260
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,350
- 他听说什么了?  - 他都画出来了
- What did he hear?  - Exactly what he drew.

261
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,611
就是那本关于一家人被吊死在树上的书
That your book is about a family that was hung.

262
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,988
- 上帝啊 埃里森  - 他也就听说了一点点?
- Christ, Ellison.  - But that's all he heard?

263
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,069
还不够吗?
That's not enough?

264
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,032
我很抱歉他发现了这些内容 好吗? 真的很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry he had to find out like this, all right? I am.

265
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,992
但是 事情已经发生了
But, come on, it was bound to happen.

266
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,577
什么? 你就是这么想的啊? 你觉得这无所谓?
Really? That's your response? You think that makes it OK?

267
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,538
不 怎么会无所谓?
No, it doesn't make it OK. all right?

268
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,704
没说他们发生这些事正常
Nothing about what happened to these people is OK.

269
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,668
但是好人多磨难
But bad things happen to good people

270
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,754
所以仍需要有人叙述他们的故事
and they still need to have their story told.

271
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,760
- 这是他们应得的  - 你还真体恤人民啊
- They deserve that much.  - You're a real man of the people.

272
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,013
噢 别这样...
Oh, come...

273
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,900
- 我要哄孩子们上床睡觉了  - 替我亲亲他们说晚安
- I'm putting the kids to bed.  - Kiss them good night for me.

274
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,939
- 你手上的活儿有进展了?  - 是啊
- You're getting good work done?  - Yeah.

275
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,949
那不错 请把门关好
Good. Please keep the door closed.

276
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,386

282

被人发现在家中被刺死

283
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,374
警方现寻求任何
and police now are asking for any information

284
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,629
可以找到任何关于本恶性循环杀人和诱拐儿童案件的信息
that could lead to Christopher's return or the apprehension of any suspects

285
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,587

说真的呢 我没事
Really, I'm fine.

291
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,362
我宁愿带你去医院检查一下 你应该缝针
I'd prefer to take you down to the hospital. You should get stitches.

292
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,951
- 但是我不会强迫你的  - 好吧 我不准备去呢
- Can't force you, though.  - Yeah, and I'm not gonna go.

293
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,742
现在已经止血了 要是它又开始流血
The bleeding's stopped for now, but if it starts again

294
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,411
或肿了 立即叫医生
or if there's any more swelling, call a doctor immediately.

295
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,671
- 谢谢 十分感谢  - 没关系
- Thank you. Appreciate it.  - OK.

296
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:50,637
- 往这走  - 那...来看看这个洞
- This way.  - So... let's go see this hole.

297
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,060
你说你在停电之后在阁楼上
So you say you heard a loud thump and footsteps in the attic

298
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,390
听到一声巨响和脚步声?
after the power went out?

299
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,600
是的
Yes.

300
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,017
- 但是梯子没放下来?  - 没 没有放下来
- But the ladder wasn't down?  - No, it wasn't.

301
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,733
那没可能从里面关上阁楼?
It's not possible to close it from inside the attic?

302
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,738
没可能
No.

303
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,899
那闯入者是怎么上来的?
So how would an intruder get up there?

304
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,411
我没说有过有谁在上面 我只是说他听起来像是有人闯进来了
I didn't say anyone was up there. I said it sounded like there was an intruder.

305
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,574
- 虽然我的确有看到了一只小蛇  - 蛇可没脚
- I did see a small snake, though.  - Snakes don't have feet.

306
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,625
我...我估计你这有松鼠
You know, I'm... I'm guessing that you got squirrels.

307
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,381
你知道吗 你这没法进出
With, you know, way in and out up there

308
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,009
附近还都停电了
and all the power gone off in the neighbourhood.

309
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,674
我赌他们被这一切突然停电的声音吓到了
I bet they got spooked from the sound of everything shutting down at once.

310
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,841
- 你懂得  - 那不一定
- You know how they are.  - Not really.

311
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,807
- 我不是个松鼠迷  - 真的?
- I'm not really a squirrel guy.  - Really?

312
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,143
不过我刚搬来的时候倒是杀了只蝎子
I did kill a scorpion when we first moved in here, though,

313
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,979
所以我应该找个杀虫公司杀虫
so maybe I should get an exterminator.

314
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:49,362
蝎子是有脚 但是不会听着像松鼠这样的动静
Scorpions have feet. but you wouldn't hear erm like you would squirrels.

315
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,403
好吧 长官 十分感谢
Well. Officer, thank you very much.

316
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,116
这... 我会... 如果还有什么其他我能为你做的...
It's... I will... If there's anything else I can do for you...

317
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,999
事实上 有 我把那本"肯塔基州血案"放警局了
Actually, there is. I left my copy of Kentucky Blood down at the station.

318
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,125
要是上面有你的签名的话 对我来说就意义非凡了
It'd really mean a lot to me if you signed a copy.

319
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,380
- 我办公室有一些额外的副本  - 谢谢 太棒了
- I got a few extra copies in my office.  - Thank you so much. That's so great.

320
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,468
哇 你知道吗? 这就像那些FBI分析师的办公室
Wow. Do you know what? This is like one of them FBI profiler's offices.

321
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,722
你这还有个地脉图 上面连着各种图片和有关联的地点
You got a map with pictures connected with yarn and everything.

322
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,760
副警 麻烦你到外面去 说真的 这是我的私人办公室
Deputy. I need you to step outside. This is my private office. I'm serious.

323
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,724
- 在外面等着   - 奥斯华先生 听着
- Just wait outside.  - Mr Oswalt. Listen.

324
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,765
就是在你书里有一页
You know there's a page in your books

325
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,276
你总是写关于帮助你的那些人的好话
where you always say nice things about all the people that helped you out?

326
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,778
- 致谢词?  - 是的...
- The acknowledgements?  - Yeah. Well...

327
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,737
但是有一行总是写着 你知道的
Yeah, and in each one there's always like a line that says, you know.

328
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,402
"如果没有某某警局副警们的不懈努力
" I couldn't have done this without the tireless efforts

329
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,493
我是无法完成此作"
of Deputy So And So from the local police department."

330
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,078
没错
Right.

331
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,461
你懂得 我就能当...
Well, you know, I could be like...

332
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,749
你所说的某某副警 你要是没有的话 你懂得
you know, your Deputy So And So, you know, if you don't already have one.

333
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,464
是啊 事实上有些事你是可以帮到我的
Yeah, there are a few things you could do for me, actually.

334
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,299
- 真的吗?  - 是的 绝对是好事
- Really?  - Yeah. this could be perfect.

335
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,555
- 你有记事本吗?  - 额...
- Do you have a notepad?  - Um...

336
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,394
- 有  - 那好 那你要笔吗?
- Yes.  - All right. Do you need a pen?

337
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,354
要
Yes.

338
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,267
我需要一起凶杀案的地址
I need the street address of a crime.

339
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,856
1998年 圣德路易斯的一起一家被刺案
In 1998, St Louis, a family was stabbed to death.

340
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,488
他们被割喉了 案件相当恶劣
They had their throats out. It was a pretty ugly affair.

341
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,571
我还需要另一起谋杀案的任何详情
I also need any details you can get me on another murder,

342
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,111
1979年 一家被活活烧死在
1979, a family was burned alive,

343
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,656
自家车库自家车里的案子
parked inside their own car, in their own garage.

344
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,620
- 在哪个城市?  - 我不知道
- What city?  - I don't know.

345
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,501
我只知道年份和作案手法
All I have is the year and the method of execution.

346
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,880
额 你觉得这两起案子有关联?
Hmm. You think that the two cases are related?

347
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:36,340
- 噢 不是 不是 我就是做个调查  - 好的 我一定能给你找到这些
- Oh, no, no. I'm just doing research.  - OK. I can definitely get this for you.

348
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,177
我得等到警长离开办公室之后才能看 但是我会得手的
I gotta wait till the sheriff leaves the office, but I will get it.

349
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,341
非常感谢你 某某副警
Thank you very much, Deputy So And So.

350
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,394
- 对不起  - 怎么了?
- I'm sorry.  - For what?

351
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,060
我今天生特雷弗的气了还把火撒到了你身上
I was angry at Trevor today and I took it out on you.

352
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,570
没事 别自责 我知道这次搬家对你来说挺困难的
No, don't be sorry. I know the move's been hard for you.

353
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,450
- 我正在尝试 埃里 我真的有  - 我知道
- I'm trying, Ell. I really am.  - I know.

354
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,905
我只想你能和我在一起
I just want you here with me, that's all.

355
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,164
我一直陪着你呢 正如现在
I've always been with you. And I'm with you now.

356
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,134
很荣幸能邀请到埃里森・奥斯华到我们的节目来
Pleased to have Ellison Oswalt on our programme.

357
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,090
他的新书叫做"肯塔基州血案"
His new book is called Kentucky Blood.

358
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,880
- 你能来真好  - 很感谢能让我来 真的很荣幸
- Good to have you on.  - Thanks for having me. A real pleasure.

359
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,800
我读过了 很血腥
Man, I got into this. This is pretty graphic stuff.

360
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,219
那我就开问了? 你为什么要花那么多时间
So let me stat? by asking why you spend so much time

361
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,934
调查这些恐怖事件
investigating such grisly content?

362
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,145
金钱和名誉? 当然不是 我开玩笑的
Fame and money? No, I'm just kidding.

363
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,734
实话就是我被非正义之感所牵动
The honest answer is that I'm really driven by a sense of injustice.

364
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,690
每当我想到发生在这些人身上的一系列可怕的事的时候
When I think about the awful things that happened to these people

365
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,407
甚至连罪犯都无法确认 更别说抓罪犯了...
and that those responsible were never even identified, let alone caught...

366
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,822
我的意思是 我知道当我开始调查的时候
I mean, I knew when I started this particular case

367
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,992
我会发现一些其他人可能忽略的东西
that I might stumble on a few things that maybe somebody'd overlooked.

368
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,287
可能? 不 你的确发现了警方
Might? No, you in fact did uncover some additional information

369
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,922
忽略的东西
that the cops had overlooked.

370
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:58,585
好吧 听着 首先 在这有很多的好警察
Well, look, first of all, there are a lot of good police officers out there

371
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,220
我不想通过任何方式贬低他们的努力 好吧?
and I don't wanna in any way disparage what they do, right?

372
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,100
但是一旦警察工作有误那便会毁人一生
But in police work getting something wrong means ruining people's lives.

373
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,225
一部好的犯罪作品能够引导对的事情
Good crime writing can set things right.

374
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,059
所以 最后 那种感觉更好?
So, ultimately, what feels better?

375
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:14,351
伸张正义亦或是你的书"肯塔基州血案"
Seeing justice done or seeing your book, Kentucky Blood,

376
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,020
位于纽约时报最佳销量排行榜之首?
number one on the New York Times bestseller list?

377
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,899
毫无疑问 伸张正义
The justice, without question.

378
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,741
要是为了名誉和金钱而写书的话我宁愿自砍双手
I'd rather cut my hands off than write a book for fame or money.

379
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,404
- 你正给爸爸弄咖啡吗?  - 是的
- Are you making Daddy his coffee?  - Yes.

380
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,285
我能帮你吗? 我想拿给他
Can I help? I wanna bring it to him.

381
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,413
当然可以啦 宝贝 但是我们得保质保量
Sure, honey, but we have to make it just right.

382
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,745
他对咖啡可是很挑剔的哦
He's very particular about his coffee.

383
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,512
- 爸爸 我给你端来你的咖啡了  - 噢 谢谢你 小心肝
- Brought you your coffee, Daddy.  - Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

384
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,348
-噢
- Oh.

385
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,263
- 你好啊  - 嘿 奥斯华先生
- Yeah, hello.  - Hey, Mr Oswalt.

386
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,103
嘿 某某副警
Hey, Deputy So And So.

387
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,267
对不起这么晚才回给你
I'm sorry to get back to you so fate in the day.

388
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,108
我不能从办公室打电话 警长 你懂得
I couldn't make the call from the office. You know, the sheriff.

389
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,069
- 是的 我懂  - 但是我找到了你要的
- Yeah, I understand.  - But I got what you asked about.

390
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,901
1979年有个马丁内斯一家在加州的萨克拉门托
There was a Martinez family in Sacramento, California,

391
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,412
死于自家车库 他们的车被点了
that died in their garage in 1979, their car was set on fire.

392
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,869
有一个9岁的儿子 但是再也没找到他
One of their sons, nine years old, they never found him.

393
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:03,209
- 有地址吗?  - 在萨克拉门托比林顿8224号
- Do you have the street address?  - It's 8224 Billington, Sacramento.

394
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,462
那圣路易斯呢?
And what about St Louis?

395
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,375
这家凶杀案的地址在
The address of the house where the Miller murders occurred is

396
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,385
圣路易斯山麓上 2976号
2976 Piedmont Way, St Louis.

397
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:15,220
太棒了 29... 等一下 你是说2976 像29-76?
That is excellent. 29... Wait, did you say 2976, like 29-76?

398
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,009
是啊 有意义吗?
Yeah. Does that mean something to you?

399
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,055
不 不 没有 谢谢 谢谢你 副警
No, no, it doesn't. No. Thank you. Thank you. Deputy.

400
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,144
在史蒂文森一家搬到这之前
Before the Stevensons moved here.

401
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,234
他们住过米勒一家的案发现场这儿?
They lived where the Miller family murders happened?

402
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,490
我去
Holy shit.

403
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,113
艾希莉?
Ashley?

404
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,575
特雷弗?
Trevor?

405
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,630
我的天 他还好吗?
Oh, my God. Is he OK?

406
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,548
我在外面发现了他
I found him outside.

407
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,264
我们得给他的门上个锁 这次比之前还糟糕
We have to put a lock on his door. It's way worse than it was.

408
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,520
早上我会打电话给医生的
I'll call the doctor in the morning.

409
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,106
你和他待在一起 我把东西落在外面了
You stay with him. I left something outside.

410
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,804
好狗狗 好狗狗
Good dog. Good dog.

411
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,557
我没想着伤害你
I don't wanna hurt you.

412
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,435
我就想拿回我的棒球棒...
I just wanna get my bat...

413
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,606
那如果你往我这来 我就打爆你的头啦 行吗?
so if you come at me, I can bash your head in, OK?

414
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,022
好吧 你留着吧
That's fine. You keep it.

415
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,161
- 你还好吗?  - 嗯 我没事 没事
- You OK?  - Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

416
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,212
特雷弗都这么大了 本应不会发病了
Trevor's too old to still be having these.

417
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,249
他这年纪本该不会再犯夜惊了
He was supposed to have outgrown them by now.

418
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,793
- 他很好 没事  - 你停止吧
- He's all right. He's OK.  - Just stop.

419
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,425
- 停止什么?  - 放弃这本书吧
- Stop what?  - Drop the book.

420
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,141
我们可以收拾行李 离开这里 再也不回这里
We can pack up, get out of town and never look back.

421
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,177
为什么 就因为他梦惊?
Why, cause he's having some night terrors?

422
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,267
比这还严重 他从来没像现在这么糟
It's more than that. He's never been this bad.

423
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,852
- 不也从来没像现在这么糟糕  - 你说什么呢?
- You've never been this bad.  - What are you talking about?

424
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,768
你在这本书上花了还不到一个星期的时间就已经一团糟了
You've been at this book less than a week and you're already a mess.

425
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,358
你从来没有这么早就开始喝威士忌
You never crack into the whisky this early and this often.

426
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,239
- 你的意思是说我是个酒鬼?  - 没有
- You're saying I'm a drunk?  - No.

427
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,742
我是说你有事儿瞒着我
I'm saying there's something you aren't telling me,

428
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,279
有事让你纠结 但不管是什么事儿 它似乎也影响到了特雷弗
something that's eating you up, and it seems to be getting to Trevor as well.

429
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,324
- 这次不一样  - 是啊 你想知道是什么吗?
- Somethings different this time.  - Yeah, you wanna know what it is?

430
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,164
- 你想知道多少?  - 我想知道为什么你现在不一样了
- How much do you wanna know?  - I wanna know why you're different.

431
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,705
我现在是不一样了 那是因为我从来没有发现过这么大的事情
I'm different because I've never been onto something this big before.

432
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,169
你还记得我写"肯塔基"的时候吗?
Do you remember how it was when I was writing Kentucky?

433
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,211
- 我记得  - 这次的困难比上次还要大! 大的多了!
- I remember.  - This is much bigger than that! Much!

434
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,221
我说的可能是一个非常重要工作
I am talking about a potentially important work here.

435
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,805
我说的是一个巨作 是我翻身的机会
I'm talking about a mega hit. This could be my In Cold Blood.

436
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:36,689
一个电影制作 谈话节目 你说呢? 国家图书奖
A movie deal, talk show circuit, right? A national book award.

437
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,600
能拥有比现在更多的钱... 到哪都不用愁了
More money than we could... We could live wherever we wanted to.

438
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,144
- 我不在乎这些  - 你当然在乎 谁都在乎
- I don't care about any of that.  - You do. Everybody does.

439
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,688
- 我只是...  - 这是我的契机 特蕾西
- I'm just...  - This is my shot, Tracy.

440
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,401
你只是什么?
You're just what?

441
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:54,245
- 我只是担心你  - 好吧 别担心我 没事的
- I'm just worried about you.  - Well, don't be. Nothing is wrong.

442
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,000
那为什么你进来的时候脸色惨白
Then why did you come in white as a ghost?

443
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,962
因为我看到一只狗了 好吗?
Because I saw a dog, OK?

444
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,921
- 一只狗?  - 一只巨大的狗 像狂犬库丘那么大
- A dog?  - A very big dog, like Cujo big.

445
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,257
我是说 我从来没见过这么大的狗 他就好像...
I mean, I'd never seen him before. He's like...

446
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,422
- 你把他赶走了吗?  - 是的 他走了
- Did you get rid of him?  - Yeah, he's gone.

447
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,217
听着 我只需要一点点的时间 好吗?
Listen, I just need a little more time. OK?

448
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,681
我保证它值得
I promise it's worth it.

449
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,815
我们在这待着的每一分钟 就离我们一直
Every minute that we're here, we're a minute closer to that happy ending

450
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,520
憧憬的梦想更近
that we always dreamed of.

451
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,731
我们快要梦想成真了
We're almost there.

452
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,156
好吗?
OK?

453
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,113
- 副警  - 奥斯华先生 这些是上午收到的
- Deputy.  - Mr Oswalt, these came in this morning.

454
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:37,624
我传真给你了一些相关的文件
I had a few of the pertinent files pulled for you and had faxed over.

455
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,126
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

456
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,378
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thanks.  - No problem.

457
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,373
我能进来待一会儿吗?
Do you think I could come in for a second?

458
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,509
额... 当然
Uh... Yeah. sure.

459
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,510
- 谢谢  - 来 就这
- Thanks.  - Come on, just here.

460
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,138
听着 我...我知道你肯定对我有想法
Look, I... I know what you must think of me.

461
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,598
一个小镇里的小副警追一个著名的作家的星
Some small-town deputy that's starstruck with the famous writer.

462
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,017
- 但是我不是一个小城镇里的白痴  - 我没说你是...
- But I'm not some local moron.  - I didn't say you were a... you know.

463
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,684
我有犯罪学学位
I have a degree in criminology.

464
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,151
而且我上过一些法医学的课程
I've taken my fair share of forensic science courses.

465
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:13,570
当我看到了一系列谋杀案的时候 我也知道有联系 奥斯华先生
I also know a series of connected murders when I see one, Mr Oswalt.

466
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,454
- 听着...  - 我们忽略了一些东西 我知道
- Look...  - We missed something. I get that.

467
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,787
但是如果你想要我帮你继续完成这个工作
But if you want me to run interference for you while you get this worked out.

468
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,830
你必须让我知道一些头绪 一点儿就行
I gotta be in the loop just a little bit.

469
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,380
- 你真的想要帮我?  - 这是我的家 奥斯华先生
- You really wanna help?  - It's my home, Mr Oswalt.

470
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,171
在这发生的事情也会在我们所有人身上发生
What happened here happened to all of us.

471
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,260
好吧 来这
All right. Come here.

472
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,401
那是谁?
Who is that?

473
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,689
我不知道 那就是我希望找到的
I don't know. That's what I'm hoping to find out.

474
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,277
- 你认为这是起连坏杀人案吗?  - 有可能
- You think these are serial murders?  - Maybe.

475
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,913
与其说是连环杀人案不如说是更像个仪式 但是真的分布的太广了
More ritualized than necessarily serial. But really spread out.

476
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,794
不仅仅在地域上广 还有时间 第一起要追溯到60年代了
And not just regionally but over time. The first one dates back to the 60s.

477
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,001
- 1960年代?  - 是的
- The 1960s?  - Yeah.

478
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,508
那就可以推算这个人的岁数 等等 他70多岁了?
That would put the guy, wait, in his 70s?

479
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,215
- 是啊 或者是60几岁  - 是啊 我...
- Yeah. or his 60s.  - Yeah, I...

480
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,221
- 我不知道  - 看看这手法
- I don't know.  - Well, look at the methodology.

481
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,884
毒物学报告说 有可能凶手对受害者下药了
Toxicology reports. some cases the killer drugged his victims.

482
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,805
- 下的什么?  - 他们也没法确定
- With what?  - Well, they couldn't tell for sure.

483
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,192
但是通过下药的话 凶手就不需要武力制服这些受害人
But by drugging them, the killer removes his need to overpower them.

484
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,603
他在这用了一个树枝做重力
Here he used a tree branch to do the heavy lifting.

485
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:33,273
在萨克拉门托他烧死了一家人 在圣路易斯他割了他们的喉
In Sacramento he lit a family on fire. In St Louis he slit their throats.

486
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,444
- 他淹死了第一个家庭  - 淹? 你...
- The first family he drowned.  - Drowning? You...

487
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,079
你从来没说过有谁被淹死了
You never said anything about anyone being drowned.

488
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,706
这是这些谋杀案仅有的一个重要关联
The only other significant link between the murder cases

489
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:46,086
那就是凶手杀了除了一个人以外的整个家庭成员
is that in each instance the killer murdered the entire family except one.

490
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,246
他带走了一个小孩
A child which he took with him.

491
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:54,011
而且这个符号也出现在了这些犯罪现场
That and this symbol appears in several of the crime scenes.

492
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,264
看起来好像来自超自然的东西
That looks like something from out of the occult.

493
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,892
听着 你可以问问大学里的人
Look you might wanna call the university.

494
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,349
那有个教授 乔纳斯教授
There's a professor over there. Professor Jonas.

495
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,763
他是个超自然犯罪的专家
He's an occult crime expert

496
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,651
而且州警要让他处理过一些... 一些奇怪的案子
and the state police bring him in on some of the... the weirder stuff.

497
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,731
我觉得这个也很奇怪
I think this qualifies.

498
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,989
那你觉得淹死案是在哪发生的?
So where do you think that drowning happened?

499
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,525
这就是我想知道的
That's what I need you to find out.

500
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,156
好的
OK.

501
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,130
- 乔纳斯教授?  - 是的
- Professor Jonas?  - Yes.

502
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,801
你好 谢谢你这么快回我 十分感激
Hello. Hey, thank you for getting back to me so quickly. I appreciate that.

503
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,767
当然 我可是你的头号粉丝 你给我发邮件让我受宠若惊
Of course, I'm a really big fan. I'm flattered that you emailed.

504
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,477
我一看到你发的照片
Once I saw the photos that you sent,

505
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,314
我就知道你在调查哪些案子
I knew exactly what cases you were studying.

506
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,067
等等 你怎么知道我在调查那些案子?
Wait. How would you know what cases I was looking at?

507
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,951
你给我发的符号... 不是一个五角星
The symbol that you sent me is... isn't a pentagram.

508
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,111
也不是一个你可以看到的
It's not something that you would see teenagers

509
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:10,703
某些年轻人或者是挪威黑金属乐队想要前卫而用羊血在墙上涂的画
or a Norwegian black metal band paint on a wall in goat's blood to be edgy.

510
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,538
- 好吧  - 或是为了惹怒那些基督教徒们...
- Right.  - Or to piss off the Christians...

511
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,579
不 这个比那更模糊
No, this is a little bit more obscure than that.

512
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,545
我知道在走廊的那一个
I know the one in the hallway,

513
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,462
那是90年代后期在圣路易斯的
that's from the late '90s in St Louis.

514
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,264
另外一个 这个...车盖上
The other one, the... the car hood,

515
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,097
那是大约30年前在萨克拉门托的
that is from Sacramento, that's about 30 years ago.

516
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,011
告诉我关于萨克拉门托的那一个
Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

517
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:35,478
这个符号与一个异教神的崇拜有关
It's a symbol associated with the worship of a pagan deity.

518
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,358
一个神? 哪种神?
A deity? What kind of deity?

519
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,613
非常模糊的一个 可以追溯到巴比伦时代
A very obscure one, dating back to Babylonian times.

520
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,321
叫做巴格胡尔 吃小孩的神
Named Bughuul, the eater of children.

521
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:50,956
- 你是说吃小孩?  - 是的 吃小孩 谢谢你 Jessica
- Did you say eater?  - Yes, of children. Thank you, Jessica.

522
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,787
你查的这些案子
The crimes that you're dealing with.

523
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,372
他们都有一个关键因素就是有失踪的小孩 没错吧?
They all have the element of a missing child, correct?

524
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,038
是的是的 没错
Yes. Yeah. That's correct.

525
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,333
巴格胡尔吃小孩
Well, Bughuul eats children.

526
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,127
现在 所幸存故事的片段
Now, the fragments of stories that have survived,

527
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:09,683
都围绕着为生存而吃小孩的灵魂
they all revolve around him needing the souls of human children to survive.

528
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,937
每一个故事都牵涉他以不同方式
Now, each story involves a different way

529
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:19,317
引诱或骗小孩离开现实世界
that he lures or tricks these children away from the physical world

530
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,650
然后把他们留在自己的冥府
and traps them in his own netherworld

531
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,861
并逐渐蚕食他们的灵魂
and he consumes their souls over time.

532
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,746
现在 任何一种对于这种神魔的崇拜都需要血祭
Now, any worship of this deity would include a blood sacrifice

533
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,578
或者吃小孩
or the wholesale eating of a child.

534
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,462
你的意思是留下这标记的人正在吃小孩?
So you're saying the person that made this symbol is... is eating children?

535
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,588
是的 这很符合故事的发展
Well, that would fit the stories.

536
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,377
当然有时这个标志出现的时候
Of course, the few times that this symbol has shown up,

537
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,842
没有一种犯罪以任何形式与其有关
none of the crimes have been related in any way to any of this.

538
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,224
所以这更像是某个邪教的开启
So this might be more of a cult initiation

539
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,478
而不是某个个人的行为
rather than, you know, the actual actions of any one man.

540
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,601
还有类似的事正在上演 是吗?
There's been another one, hasn't there?

541
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,866
我想是的
I think so, yes.

542
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,026
告诉我你知道的一切
Tell me everything you can.

543
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,159
嘘
Shh.

544
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:03,388
- 警官 非常感激你能过来一趟  - 哦 没关系的
- I appreciate you coming by, Officer.  - Oh, yeah, it's not a problem at all.

545
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:08,598
- 我们现在是朋友 对吗?  - 我想是的
- So we're becoming friends. right?  - I... I suppose, yeah.

546
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,888
- 我的意思是我可以信任你 对吗?  - 是的 当然
- I mean, I can trust you, right?  - Yeah, absolutely.

547
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,857
那么如果我很认真问你一些事的话
So if I were to ask you something in earnest.

548
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,644
你不会想得太多吧
You wouldn't read too much into it?

549
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,063
额... 没问题
Um... All right.

550
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:28,702
史蒂文森一家发生过什么奇怪的事情吗?
Was there anything... weird about the Stevensons?

551
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:35,003
他们从没抱怨过一些奇怪的事情吗?
No complaints from them about anything... strange?

552
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,540
据我所知没有
No, not to my knowledge.

553
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,676
调查人员有发现什么奇怪或者无法解释的事情吗
The investigators. did they notice anything odd or inexplicable

554
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,259
关于这个房子 没有什么奇怪的传言吗?
about the house, any... any weird stories?

555
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,048
没有
No.

556
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,351
奥斯华先生 你是不是想告诉我些什么?
Mr Oswalt. is there something that you wanna tell me?

557
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,228
好吧 听着 显然发生了一些事情并且你想和别人谈谈 对吗?
Okay,look! Clearly something happened and you wanna talk to somebody about it, right?

558
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,940
是的
Yeah.

559
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,323
好吧 那么你的妻子知道这件事吗?
OK, well, does your wife know about it?

560
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,576
等等
Wait.

561
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:12,783
她知道这里以前是谁的房子吗?
Does she know whose house this is... was?

562
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,884
哦 哥们 我真希望自己没进行过这次谈话
Oh, man. Oh, that is a conversation that I would not wanna be around for.

563
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,589
- 不 我也不想  - 我很抱歉
- No, me neither.  - I'm sorry.

564
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:30,259
那么 你是在房子里看见了一些奇怪的事情 听到了一些毛骨悚然的声音 对吗?
So... So, what, you saw something weird, heard something spooky in the house?

565
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,354
- 是的 的确  - 那究竟是什么呢?
- Yes. Precisely.  - What exactly?

566
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,983
现在...
Now...

567
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:44,610
我并不相信有那种东西 你懂的
I don't believe in any, you know, stuff.

568
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:48,902
哪种东西? 你指的是超自然 抽象的 非正常的事物吗?
Stuff? You mean the supernatural, the metaphysical, the paranormal.

569
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,196
- 那一类的东西?  - 是的
- That type of stuff?  - Right.

570
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,955
好吧 当然你不会相信
Right. Of course you don't.

571
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,458
如果你相信的话你也不会搬到一个犯罪现场去住
You never would have moved into a crime scene if you did.

572
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,836
但是我们现在正在讨论它
But here we are having this conversation.

573
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,965
是的 但是 有没有...
Yeah, but... but there was...

574
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:07,880
难道史蒂文森一家从没发生过类似的事情吗?
there was none of that, you know, none of that with the Stevensons, huh?

575
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,925
没有 史蒂文森一家只在这里待了很短的一段时间
No. In the short amount of time that the Stevensons lived here,

576
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,015
他们从没报过警也没有被警察拜访过
they never called the police, they never had the police called on them

577
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,647
在调查中也没有报道说发生过什么奇怪的事情
or reported anything bizarre that came up in the investigation.

578
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,730
- 你想知道我是怎么想的吗?  - 想
- Do you wanna know what I think?  - Yes.

579
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,075
我认为你搬进这个谋杀案受害者住过的房子
I think that you moved yourself into the house of murder victims

580
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:32,203
然后又很快开始将自己置身于他们当时的情境里
and immediately set about trying to put yourself in their head space.

581
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,991
我觉得你开始发现了这案子中的一些蹊跷
I also think that you've begun discovering things about this case

582
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:40,003
但那比你所想象的黑暗的多
that go to darker places than you were prepared for.

583
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,789
我也发现每一次我来你家
I also think that every time that I've been to your house.

584
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,504
几乎毫无例外 你都在喝威士忌
There's a whisky bottle that doesn't appear to be neglected.

585
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,296
- 不 不 不 我...  - 奥斯华先生 听着 我并不是
- No, no, no. I...  - Mr Oswalt. listen. I don't. I don't...

586
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,932
我并不是说是你在酗酒 我并不认为是这样
I'm not saying that you have a drinking problem. I don't think that.

587
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,764
我也不认为你编造了这一切
Nor do I think that you're making any of this up...

588
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,724
- 当然不是  - 为了获得大众的注意
- No!  - to get attention.

589
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,357
我认为你身上背负了太大的压力
What I do think is that... that you are under so much stress.

590
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,483
你把自己置于如此大的压力之下
You've put yourself under so much stress.

591
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:07,863
而你的大脑又试图一次性全部消化
That your mind is trying to process all of it at once.

592
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,321
所以你根本不相信超自然的事物 对吗?
So you don't believe any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

593
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,956
你在开玩笑吗? 我相信那所有的一切
Are you kidding me? I believe in all that stuff.

594
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,163
但我就算只有一晚 我也绝不会睡在这种地方 你疯了吗?
I... I wouldn't sleep one night in this place. Are you nuts?

595
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,296
四个人在你的后院吊死
Four people were hung by their necks in the tree in your backyard

596
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,378
而那个小女孩现在只有上帝才知道她在哪
and that little girl is probably God knows wherever.

597
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,295
- 好吧  - 我很抱歉 你知道吗?
- OK.  - I'm... I'm sorry. You know what?

598
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,557
奥斯华先生 你应该试着多出去走走 这样可以让大脑清醒一点
You should try and get out more, Mr Oswalt, try to clear your head.

599
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,103
你是认真的吗?
Total honesty?

600
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:47,396
昨晚我感觉到房子里有东西
Last night I thought something was in the house...

601
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,987
而我醒来的时候躺在沙发上手里拿着一支棒球棒
and I woke up on the couch holding a baseball bat.

602
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,326
好吧 如果我大晚上的觉得我家里有什么东西的话
Well... I guess if I thought something was in my home at night.

603
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,207
我也一定会吓坏的
I'd be a little bit freaked out too.

604
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,997
但是听着 奥斯华先生 如果你继续睡在这个房子里
But, listen, Mr Oswalt, if you sleep in this house.

605
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,836
这只会让你的大脑变得更加糟糕
It's just gonna do terrible things to your head.

606
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,555
埃里森!
Ellison!

607
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,340
- 埃里森!  - 发生什么了?
- Ellison!  - What's going on?

608
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:20,478
你女儿觉得自己房间的墙上没有足够的地方再画画了
Your daughter thought there wasn't room on her walls for her new painting.

609
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,388
- 艾希莉!  - 不 不是那样的
- Ashley!  - No, that's not it.

610
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,683
我们不是说好了吗? 我们只给你定了一条规矩
What did we talk about? We only gave you one rule.

611
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,227
我们让你在自己的墙上画画已经很不容易了
It was a big deal for us to let you paint on your walls.

612
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,067
- 我们是怎么约定的 艾希莉?  - 只准在卧室画画
- What's the rule, Ashley?  - Paint only goes in the bedroom.

613
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,231
是什么让你觉得你可以在这外面画画了?
And what makes you think you can paint out here?

614
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,992
我想替她画画 但她不想我画在自己的房间里
I wanted to paint her picture, but she didn't want it in my room

615
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,495
因为那里以前是他哥哥的房间
because that used to be her brother's room.

616
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,202
什么? 你说的是谁?
What? Who are you talking about?

617
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,708
- 斯蒂芬妮  - 谁是斯蒂芬妮?
- Stephanie.  - Who's Stephanie?

618
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:47,418
她以前住在这里 她是爸爸书里面的一个人物
She used to live here. She's the one Daddy's writing his book about.

619
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,463
艾希莉 回你的房间把门关上
Ashley, go to your room and shut the door.

620
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,937
你究竟在想什么? 你觉得我不会发现吗?
What the hell were you thinking? Did you think I wouldn't find out?

621
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:11,149
嘘 我当然知道你最后一定会发现的 好吗?
Shh. Of course I knew you were gonna find out eventually, OK?

622
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,282
但是不要怪我不告诉你 你从来也不想知道这些
But don't blame me for not telling you. You never wanted to know.

623
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,908
你别把这一切都试图推给我
Don't try and pin this on me.

624
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,694
我问过你! 我问你我们是不是住在那所房子附近!
I asked you! I asked you if we were living near the house!

625
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:22,115
你是问我我们是不是住在离犯罪现场隔了两栋的房子里
You asked me if we were living two houses down from a crime scene.

626
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,908
- 你怎么能这样!  - 我说了不是
- Don't you dare!  - I said no.

627
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,543
- 我们就不该来这!  - 特蕾西没有人死在这里
- We never should have come here!  - Tracy, nobody died here.

628
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,042
我们并不是睡在死过人的地方
It's not like were sleeping where somebody was killed

629
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,674
我们也不需要清理墙上的血迹才能开门招待客人
or they had to wipe blood off the walls for the open house.

630
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:35,336
- 你是说这里什么都没有发生吗?  - 不是 一切都发生在后院
- You're saying it didn't happen here?  - No. It happened in the backyard.

631
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,006
哦 这太令人感觉恶心了 天哪 你认为这有什么不同吗?
Oh, that is so sick! God. you think that makes a difference?

632
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,471
- 当然不一样  - 不 埃里森 这没什么不一样
- It does.  - No, Ellison. It doesn't.

633
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,682
你过去就已经做了一些疯狂的事情
You have done some crazy shit in the past.

634
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,391
但没有比这一次再疯狂的事情了
But this definitely takes the cake.

635
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,898
我的天哪 究竟是什么让你要搬到这里来的?
My God. what on earth possessed you to move here?

636
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,480
- 我们以前并没有破产  - 这并不是理由
- We've never been this broke before.  - That's no excuse.

637
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,561
这个地方的市价我们简直就是捡了一个大便宜
This place came on the market. It was a steal.

638
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,402
哎 我想知道为什么
Gee, I wonder why.

639
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,568
所以特雷弗上周画的东西的确在这里发生过?
So what Trevor drew last week, that happened here?

640
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,074
是的
Yes.

641
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:05,788
房子原先的主人在我们后院的树上吊死了?
The previous owners of this home were hung from a tree in our backyard?

642
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,419
- 是的  - 这太恶心了 特雷弗
- Yes.  - That is so sick. Ellison.

643
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,921
你还让我们的小女儿在后院里玩?
And you let our little girl play back there?

644
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,127
为什么不呢?
Why shouldn't I?

645
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,337
我们的儿子总是夜惊
Our son is having night terrors

646
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,719
还在学校里画犯罪场景
and drawing pictures of this crime at school.

647
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,096
而我们女儿则刚在自家墙上画了一个已经死掉的女孩
And our daughter just painted a dead girl on our wall.

648
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,758
她失踪了 严格意义上来说她是失踪了
She's missing. Technically she's missing.

649
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,302
我不想听这种技术细节
I don't wanna hear about technicalities.

650
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,061
你清楚自己做了什么吗
Do you understand what you've done,

651
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,269
你知道你将你的孩子 你的婚姻置于何种危险之中吗?
the kind of jeopardy you've put your children in, your marriage?

652
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,523
是的 我知道
Yes, I do!

653
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,483
为了你那本该死的书 还有什么你干不出来吗?
Is there anything you won't do for your goddamn book?

654
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,155
显然没有 我想只有这本书才对你有价值
Apparently not. I guess this is all worth it to you.

655
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,411
- 它的确有价值  - 值得让你将家庭陷于危险之中
- It's worth it.  - Putting your family at risk.

656
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,573
- 有什么危险? 多了些画所以危险?  - 别说了 你的女儿...
- Risk of what? Of more paintings?  - Don't. Your daughter...

657
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,412
我的女儿有个很爱她的父亲
My daughter has a father who loves her,

658
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,453
他总是在她身边 鼓励她做自己
who is always around, who encourages her to be herself.

659
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,542
她身上发生最糟糕的事情
The worst thing that has ever happened to her

660
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,458
就是有一次她住进了一个全家被谋杀的房子
is one time she moved into a house where a family was killed.

661
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,719
她发现了这桩谋杀案 她对于那个小女孩感到十分遗憾
She found out about the murders, so she felt sorry for the little girl.

662
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,175
所以她画了该死的那幅画
So she painted a fucking picture!

663
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,808
这就是她所做的 这也是她经常在做的
That's what she does. It's what she always has done.

664
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,937
- 就这样了? 这就是你要说的全部?  - 你还想要我怎样?
- That's it? That's all you have to say?  - What else do you want from me?

665
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,474
埃里森 给我们一个让人感觉安全的家好吗?
How about a home where we feel safe, Ellison?

666
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,642
让我们住在一个邻居不再厌恶我们的地方好吗
How about neighbours that don't hate us

667
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,609
让我们去一个城镇 在那我可以去逛杂货店而不用忍受异样的目光好吗?
in a town where I can buy groceries without getting strange looks?

668
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,490
让我们过一种不会使我们的孩子受牵连的生活好吗
How about a life that doesn't involve our kids

669
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,324
而不是画那些可怕的悲剧的恶心细节
drawing and painting the sick details of some horrific tragedy

670
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,122
也不需要为了消除他们深深的焦虑
or working out their deep-seated anxieties

671
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,908
而大晚上的做一些奇怪的事情?
by doing bizarre shit in the night?

672
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:33,045
- 那样如何? 那样行得通吗?  - 我可以给你那样的一切 我可以!
- How about that? Would that be OK?  - I can give all that to you, I can!

673
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,798
- 只要等我写完了这本书就行!  - 写这本书并不是为了我们 是为了你自己
- Just when I finish the book!  - This book isn't for us. It's for you.

674
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,880
特蕾西 不要那样说 那并不是真的
Tracy, don't say that. That's not true.

675
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:42,092
的确是这样 有很多方式去支撑这个家
It is true. There are plenty of other ways you can provide for this family.

676
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,015
做什么呢? 教书?
Doing what? Teaching?

677
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,723
编辑新闻教科书?
Editing journalism textbooks?

678
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:54,439
你不明白吗 写作是我的人生意义所在?
Don't you understand that writing is what gives my life meaning?

679
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,820
这些书是我宝贵的遗产
These books are my legacy.

680
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,786
埃里森 我一直都支持你做自己热爱的事情
I have always supported you doing what you love, Ellison.

681
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,696
但写作并非你人生意义所在
But writing isn't the meaning of your life.

682
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:13,336
你和我 我们的婚姻才是你人生的意义所在
You and me, right here, this marriage' that's the meaning of your life.

683
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:17,256
你的遗产则是艾希莉和特雷弗
And your legacy, that's Ashley and Trevor.

684
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:20,133
你的孩子就是你宝贵的遗产
Your kids are your legacy.

685
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,522
- 我是不是让老爸陷入麻烦了?  - 没有 亲爱的
- Did I get Daddy in trouble?  - No, sweetie.

686
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,777
你老爸自找的麻烦
Your daddy got Daddy in trouble.

687
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:42,861
- 对不起 我不该在墙上画画的  - 我晓得了
- I'm sorry I painted on the wall.  - I know.

688
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,117
做个好梦
You get a good night's sleep.

689
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,790
这就是我为证明这事所写的书 对吧?
So here's the book I wrote proving it, right?

690
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:56,954
的确是
Exactly.

691
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:01,092
言归正传 你是不是想要组建家庭了? 这事在计划中吗?
Kidding aside, would you want a family? Is that in the cards?

692
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,297
我不知道
I don't know.

693
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,508
如果一年前你问我 我很可能说不 绝不可能 我是一个有事业心的男人
If you'd asked me a year ago, I might have said no, never, I'm a career man.

694
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:09,091
但你也知道事情就是这样 你遇见了一个人 又到了一定的年纪
But you know how it goes. You meet someone. you get a little older.

695
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,727
突然你的事业似乎不再那么重要了
All of a sudden, your career doesn't seem to matter so much.

696
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:16,311
你想要孩子了 你看见那些带着孩子的人们心想"我也想要那样"
You want kids. you start to see other people with kids and think "I want that"

697
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,103
接着你会猜想"儿子会像我吗?女儿会像她妈妈吗?"
and then you wonder "Is he gonna look like me? Is she gonna look like her?"

698
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,404
你在大脑中替她们粉刷房间 接着...
You paint rooms in your head and...

699
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,205
该睡觉了
Time for bed.

700
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,800
这是怎么回事?
What is happening?

701
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,990
该死
Shit.

702
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,219
该死
Shit.

703
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:17,108
- 你到底在做什么  - 我们必须马上离开这里
- What the hell are you doing?  - We have to leave here.

704
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,361
怎么了? 发生什么事了?
What's the matter? What's happened?

705
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,621
你是对的
You were right.

706
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,619
我犯了个错误 我们不该来这个房子的
I made a mistake. We should have never come to this house.

707
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:31,459
- 我们现在必须离开  - 埃里 你吓到我了
- We have to leave now.  - Ell, you're freaking me out here.

708
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:35,626
带上孩子 把东西打包好放进车里 我们必须离开
Get the kids, pack the car. We have to leave.

709
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,971
快!
Go!

710
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:27,303
- 亲爱的 开慢点  - 我只是想快点上高速
- Honey, slow down.  - I just wanna get on the highway.

711
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:30,939
我希望尽可能的远离这个城镇 好吗?
I wanna put as much road between us and this town as we can, OK?

712
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:32,269
好的
OK.

713
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,106
- 爸爸 我们要去哪?  - 亲爱的 我们正在回家的路上
- Where are we going, Daddy?  - We're going home, honey.

714
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:39,614
- 我们原先的家吗 就像您之前答应我的  - 是的 像我承诺的 回原先的家
- Home, home, like you promised?  - Yeah. Home, like I promised.

715
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,492
我们的东西怎么办?
What about our stuff?

716
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,074
我们早上再叫搬家公司 好吗?
We're gonna call the movers in the morning, all right?

717
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,755
没关系的
It's OK.

718
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:15,772
- 晚上好 奥斯华一家  - 长官好
- Evening, Oswalts.  - Sheriff.

719
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,981
- 驾照和登记  - 哦 天哪
- Licence and registration.  - Oh. God.

720
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:27,413
你不觉得大晚上的开得太快了吗?
Driving pretty fast for this time of night. don't you think?

721
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:30,120
有什么是我需要知道的吗?
Anything I ought to know about?

722
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,831
我只是听从了你的建议 就这样
Just trying to take your advice, that's all.

723
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,914
- 是怎样的建议呢?  - 离开小镇再不回来
- Which advice would that be?  - Leave town and never look back.

724
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:47,557
- 你该不是被恐吓了才离开或这类似的吧?  - 你什么意思?
- You weren't bullied away or anything?  - I'm sorry?

725
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:50,139
我的意思是我可不想日后读到你的书
What I mean is, I don't wanna be reading in your book

726
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:53,806
书上写一群愤怒的小镇居民将你驱赶出这里
that angry town folks chased you out of here.

727
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:56,600
如果你受到了任何不平等的待遇 请告诉我
If you've been mistreated, I wanna know about it.

728
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,643
不会有什么书了
There isn't gonna be any book.

729
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,613
不出书了?
No book?

730
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,865
不了 长官
No, sir.

731
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:13,451
那么好吧 我也找不到任何理由要你的亲笔签名
Well. then. I don't see any reason for me to have your autograph.

732
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:18,422
就再帮我个忙 在跨过县界之前请限速60公里行驶
Just one more favour. Hold it under 60 till you cross the county line.

733
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,208
直到你进入别人的管辖区域
Until you're somebody else's problem.

734
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,678
好的 长官
Yes, sir.

735
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,763
你真是那样想的吗?
Did you mean that?

736
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:30,472
关于那本书? 是的
About the book? Yeah.

737
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,937
你保证?
You promise?

738
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:35,768
我保证
I promise.

739
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,611
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

740
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,709
这个就放在那里右边的办公室里
This goes in the office, right in there on the right.

741
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:07,963
嘿 埃里 我赌十块钱特雷弗今晚一定能睡个安稳觉了
Hey, Ell, 10 bucks says Trevor sleeps through the night.

742
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,302
不 我才不拿那个打赌
No, I'm not taking that bet.

743
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:04,107
奥斯华先生 很抱歉这么久再联系你
Mr Oswalt, sorry it took so long to get back to you.

744
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,567
关于巴格胡尔的文献资料并不多
There's been so little written on Bughuul

745
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:10,030
以前也没有人去查阅过这一类的材料
that no one has actually bothered to scan any of this material before.

746
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,195
- 那么我现在看到的是什么?  - 你看到的是一幅雕板
- Well, what am I looking at?  - You're looking at an engraving.

747
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:17,116
一个是欧洲中世纪（黑暗时代）的一幅旧草图 另一个是一幅破损壁画的一些碎片
An old sketch from the Dark Ages. And fragments of a deteriorated fresco.

748
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,831
留下的并不多了 其它的都遭到了破坏
There isn't a lot left. Everything else has been destroyed.

749
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:21,586
- 为什么?  - 是迷信的缘故
- Why?  - Well, superstition.

750
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:26,376
早期的基督徒坚信巴格胡尔实际上存在于图像中
Early Christians believed that Bughuul actually lived in the images themselves

751
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,010
那是通向他们领域的入口
and that they were gateways into his realm.

752
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,637
- 入口?  - 是的
- Gateways?  - Yes.

753
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,219
古代教堂认为巴格胡尔会附在那些看过图像的人身上
The ancient Church believed that he would take possession

754
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:38,850
那些图像会驱使看过的人做出一些可怕的事情
of those who saw the images and cause them to do terrible mings,

755
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:43,358
或者有时他会诱使那些看过图像的人自己进入图像中
or in some cases he could even abduct the viewer into the images themselves,

756
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,065
那些看过图像的孩子
Children exposed to the images

757
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:50,903
尤其容易被巴格胡尔附身或者蛊惑
were especially vulnerable to Bughuul's possession and/or abduction.

758
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:54,286
- 要是把图像都摧毁了呢?  - 不好意思 我没明白
- What if you destroyed 'em?  - Sorry. I don't follow.

759
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:58,074
如果你将那些图像付之一炬 会发生什么呢?
If you destroyed the images with a fire, what would happen then?

760
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,334
什么 你是指真实的还是在故事中?
What, do you mean literally or in the stories?

761
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,463
在故事里如果图像被摧毁
In the stories if an image was destroyed,

762
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,130
那么入口就会关闭
then the gateway would be closed

763
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:10,294
巴格胡尔就没有机会进入这个世界 对吗?
and Bughuul would no longer have access to this world, right?

764
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,808
奥斯华先生 你究竟是在写什么类型的书啊?
Mr Oswalt, what kind of book are you writing exactly?

765
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:22,181
我不清楚 我甚至不确定是不是还会出书了
I don't know. I'm not even sure I have a book any more.

766
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:25,312
- 但还是很感谢您抽出宝贵的时间  - 随时愿意效劳
- But thank you for your time.  - Anytime.

767
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,761
好吧
All right.

768
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:39,864
- 你知道现在几点了吗?  - 我知道 我很抱歉
- You know what time it is?  - I know. I'm sorry.

769
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,911
但我给你打了一天的电话
But I've been trying to call you all day.

770
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,035
- 出什么问题了?  - 问题是你搬家了
- What's the problem?  - OK, the problem is that you moved.

771
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,958
这有什么问题呢?
How is that a problem?

772
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,539
我将你让我收集的资料编排在了一起
I was compiling all of the data that you had me collecting

773
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,626
我一把它们放在一起变成一份不错的可读包
and once I started putting it together into a nice readable package.

774
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,336
我发现了很明显的关联
I saw the connection, it was obvious.

775
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,378
- 是怎样的关联?  - 日期 地址
- What was it?  - The dates, the addresses.

776
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,136
每一个你让我调查的家庭
Each family that you had me look up

777
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:03,596
之前都住在上一次谋杀案发生的房子里
had previously lived in the house where one of the earlier murders took place.

778
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,102
每一家都如此? 五家都是?
Each family? All five of them?

779
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,561
是的 如果你将它们按时间顺序排列的话
Yes, and when you put them in chronological order,

780
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,817
在几件谋杀案之间你可以画出一条线
you can actually draw a line from murder to murder to murder.

781
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,274
好吧 我们知道史蒂文森一家原先住在圣特路易斯的房子里
OK, we knew that the Stevensons previously lived

782
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,815
在那里米勒一家被割喉
in the same St Louis house where the Millers had their throats cut,

783
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,484
在米勒一家被杀之前
Before the Miller family was killed,

784
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,820
米勒一家住在橘子郡同一栋房子里
the Millers lived in the same house in Orange County

785
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,114
那里正是德・卢奇奥草坪屠杀案的案发现场
where the De Luzio lawn massacre occurred.

786
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,409
你猜德・卢奇奥一家在搬来橘子郡之前住在哪里吗?
Guess where the De Luzios lived before they moved to Orange County?

787
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:31,794
住在萨克拉门托 在那里马丁内斯一家被烧死在车库里 对吗?
Sacramento where the Martinez family was burned in their garage?

788
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:35,924
没错 这种模式可以一直追溯到1966年俄勒冈溺水案
Exactly. The pattern goes back to the 1966 Oregon drownings.

789
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,086
听着 奥斯华先生 你刚刚搬出那个顺序里的最后一栋房子
Listen, Mr Oswalt, you just moved out of the last house in line.

790
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,004
如果那个家伙还存在的话
If this guy is still out there,

791
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:45,050
那你不仅是加快了他的日程 你也将自己置身其中
you not only just sped up his timeline, you put yourself in it.

792
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,520
谢谢 副官
Thanks, Deputy.

793
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:30,974
斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie.

794
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:54,165
是那些失踪的孩子干的
It's the missing kids.

795
01:39:04,534 --> 01:39:06,534
晚安 爸爸

796
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,534
我很喜欢你将电影剪辑在一起 这样比以前更好了
I like that you made the movies longer. They're better this way.

797
01:40:07,548 --> 01:40:11,008
不用担心 老爸 我不会让你感觉到任何疼痛的
Don't worry, Daddy, I will make you feel skim

798
01:40:15,548 --> 01:40:35,008
