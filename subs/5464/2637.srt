I.C. from engine 35. Need additional backup.

3
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:53,705
I.C. from engine 35. Need additional backup.

4
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:21,149
I.C. from engine 35. We need additional manpower now!

5
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:28,114
An elderly woman is trapped. We need another line up here.

6
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,868
We got Captain Brewer's team checking in.

7
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,497
My grandmother can't walk! She's trapped!

8
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,040
We'll handle it.

9
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:41,085
Gordy, we got people trapped at both ends of the hall.

10
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:42,921
Heads up. Let's do it.

11
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,848
Take care.

12
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,810
Please!

13
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,771

15
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:07,445
-Get me a baby ladder for this hole. -Don't even think about it!

16
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:11,324
-You guys stay back! l'm going in! -Gordy, goddamn it!

17
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,211
Gordy! Get that last wall on the fifth floor!

18
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,381
l.C. from fire 1028! Floor collapsing!

00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,676
Captain Brewer's fallen through! l need help.

20
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,386
This is engine 28.

21
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:35,682
Help me, please! Somebody, help me!

22
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,525
l can't breathe.

23
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,570
-Put on my mask. -Thank you.

24
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:52,031
Get your ass over here and steady that ladder!

25
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:56,202
All right, get that woman out!

26
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:59,956
All right. lnhale, okay? You got it. Come on.

27
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:04,377
-You'll be okay. -Steady that ladder! Here we go!

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,176
-We have a burn victim coming down! -l got one coming down!

29
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:17,891
Take it easy with her. Take her down.

30
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,905
Then we'll put a piece in here.

31
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:36,701
And we got it. Look at that. Wait till Mommy sees that.

32
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,080
We have to put the stand on now, okay? Here we have the stand.

33
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,166
The blue goes to blue.

34
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:47,295
We put it right in here. You see this one's blue here?

35
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,130
Hold the wings stable.

36
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:53,468
Good. There we are. Look at this.

37
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,096
-Looks good. -Good morning.

38
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,849
-Good morning. -Mom, look what we made.

39
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:04,646
-Matty, that is so cool. -Show your mommy. Come on.

40
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,065
lt must have taken hours.

41
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,735
Since 4 a.m. He was already up when l got home.

42
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,947
-He has a sore throat. -He should see Dr. Bob.

43
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,616
Want to see my lKobe Bryant slam-dunk?

44
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,662
Sweetie, l don't think you should be jumping around.

45
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:24,707
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

46
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,419
Matt is going to be clean on the double.

47
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:34,384
Dr. Bob can see him at 1 1 :30, but l have to be at the hospital.

48
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,929
-l can take him. Can you pick him up? -All right.

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,225
Yeah, great. 1 1 :30 is fine. Thank you so much.

50
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:45,478
-Now you're clean. -Come on, little buddy.

51
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,277
Come on, you're all clean. Oh, you're so slippery. Let's go.

52
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:02,662
l told you that doctor would make you feel better. Want a hot dog?

53
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,498
-How are you? -Good.

54
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:08,835
-What can l do for you? -Two hot dogs, a soda.

55
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,546
-What you want to drink? -Orange juice.

56
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,007
Okay, two hot dogs.

57
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,187
Here we go, bud.

58
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:34,486
lt's late. Where's Daddy? He should have been here by now.

59
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,329
Stay right around in here, okay, honey?

60
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,803
Officer.

61
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:45,181
Excuse me, officer.

62
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,143
l'm just going to pick up my kid.

63
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,897
lf you don't mind, it's just going to be a minute, okay? Thanks.

64
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,709
-There he is! -Where?

65
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:20,300
-Well done. lt's all because of you. -That's my job, sir.

66
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,095
This way.

67
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,306
Hi, Daddy.

68
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:30,852
Hello.

69
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,858
See? l told you he'd be here.

70
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:53,208
No!

71
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:16,731
ETA on those units!

72
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,692
Get Gilly, Perry, Copeland up here now.

73
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:24,030
The agent in charge is coming. l want paperwork in 10 minutes.

74
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:48,179
Gordy, we'll need to start an lV line.

75
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:55,311
l need to get him to the hospital. We can't get this glass out.

76
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,609
Device functioned after a motorcade arrived.

77
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:05,613
Targets: Colombian officials, American intelligence.

78
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:09,117
Guy on the phone is Brandt. ClA, works Colombia.

79
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:13,580
The other guy is Shrub. Undersecretary of State, Latin American affairs.

80
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,666
-Not a scratch on him. -Surveillance cameras?

81
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,253
-We're pulling the video now. -Where's L.A.P.D. on this?

82
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,964
They know it's ours. They're helping.

83
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:28,052
-What's the body count? -Two dozen injured. Nine dead...

84
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:32,724
...including ClA, American and Colombian military, a mailman...

85
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:37,270
...a nurse and her little boy. That's the father over there.

86
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,067
Gordy, we need to get you on a gurney.

87
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:19,646
Call our contacts. l want to know who's responsible by the day's end.

88
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,482
-Phipps, counter-terrorism. -Peter Brandt.

89
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,193
-l need to talk to him. -Not today.

90
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:28,279
Get the undersecretary to his hotel.

91
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,323
-lKeep me informed. -Right.

92
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:36,663
Okay, l'll talk to you then. Someone in your caravan was a target.

93
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:42,460
-Terrorism. Everyone's a target. -Shovel that on the press, not me.

94
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:46,131
-l need to know what you know. -When you get clearance.

95
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:50,218
l won't tell that dad the killer got away due to protocol.

96
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:55,014
Tell him what you want. We're done talking until you're cleared.

97
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:08,695
Excuse me, nurse. Excuse me. Gordon Brewer, please.

98
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:17,662
-Jack. -How you doing?

99
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,914
Hey, Gordy.

100
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,376
-How is he? -Could have been worse.

101
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:27,881
The glass missed his femoral artery by a hair. He was lucky.

102
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,057
Let me say, the full resources of the United States...

103
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,685
... will be employed to make clear...

104
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:44,814
...that we do not tolerate attacks on our city.

105
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,568
That said, we must fight the temptation...

106
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,405
...to make hasty policy decisions we may come to regret.

107
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:55,533
We can't allow an anonymous criminal...

108
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:59,078
...to unravel our partnership with Colombia.

109
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:02,123
Who was the specific target?

110
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:05,210
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

111
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:12,926
-I won't speculate. -What will the president do about it?

112
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:18,431
-He 's meeting with the Joint Chiefs. -Was the State Department warned?

113
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,891
What do we know?

114
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:24,270
The president's coming on soon. l doubt he'll say anything new.

115
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:28,483
Turner says the bomb was hidden in a police motorcycle.

116
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,238
-They don't know who triggered it. -l saw a cop.

117
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:38,284
l saw him.

118
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,916
Gordy, get back here! Goddamn it!

119
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:46,960
l saw him.

120
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,797
-Goddamn it, come here! Slow down! -l saw him.

121
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,216
You're not going anywhere!

122
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:57,262
Any problems, go through Shrub's office over at State.

123
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:01,766
That's right. Yes, he's one of us. He can handle it.

124
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,729
ls Beckett there? Or Moyers? He could help.

125
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,276
Skin of his teeth, that guy. Classic agency mold.

126
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:14,737
Get a copy of every visa on a Colombian passport.

127
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:19,159
-Everyone's covering up for him. -That's why they're called spooks.

128
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:24,414
Bastards. They must have used some kind of liquid explosive.

129
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,792
lf you'll follow me, sir.

130
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:32,672
l just want to help. Used to be with Bomb and Arson.

131
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,178
Right this way, sir. l'll take you to Agent Phipps.

132
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:54,819
Gordy Brewer is here.

133
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:59,991
-The fireman? -Yeah. Says he talked to the cop.

134
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,040
We appreciate you coming down.

135
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:11,044
We know this guy. His name is Claudio Perrini.

136
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:14,631
We think he's a terrorist called El Lobo. The Wolf.

137
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,884
Definitely the guy l bumped into.

138
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:22,180
l talked to him. l told him l was picking up my son.

139
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:25,058
The son of a bitch smiled at me.

140
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,228
The bomb may have been triggered by a cell phone.

141
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,230
-Did he have one? -l don't know.

142
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:34,108
How long between the time you saw him and the explosion?

143
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,904
Five seconds. Maybe 10 at the most.

144
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:41,115
-That's enough time to make a call? -Maybe.

145
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,661
This could be tough to watch, sir.

146
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,540
l was late.

147
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,376
They shouldn't have been there.

148
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:55,213
-They shouldn't have. -No, the bomber shouldn't have.

149
00:14:55,421 --> 00:15:00,760
Peter Brandt, ClA, Latin American section. He was one of the targets.

150
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:05,890
l'm sorry for your loss. lf there's anything l can do for you....

151
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:10,562
l promise, one way or the other, we'll catch that son of a bitch.

152
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:15,817
How do l get ahold of you?

153
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:39,466
We're not at all separated from one another. We all run the same course...

154
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:42,969
...and will find one another again.

155
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:46,222
We won't be apart, for we live for Christ.

156
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,767
Now, we are united with Christ as we go to him.

157
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:54,397
We shall all be together in Christ. Amen.

158
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,351
-This is Gordy. -Anne.

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,356
-And Matthew Brewer. -Leave us a message.

160
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,944
Mr. Brewer, my name's Ken Barnett with Lateline.

161
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:27,448
We'd love to get you in the studio to hear you tell your story...

162
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,075
...in your own words.

163
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:33,705
If that's something that interests you, please call us at 552- 12--

164
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:40,003
Now back to Rick Garcia with more on the bombing in Los Angeles.

165
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:46,050
I'm at the State Department, where the counter-terrorism headquarters...

166
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:49,679
...received a videotape from El Lobo, or The Wolf...

167
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:53,099
...a Colombian terrorist who is responsible...

168
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:59,105
...for at least 7 bombings, including the most recent in Los Angeles.

169
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:01,941
On behalfof the people of Colombia...

170
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:07,113
...I claim responsibility for the bombing in Los Angeles.

171
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:12,785
The bombing was an act ofself-defense againstAmerican war criminals.

172
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:16,873
As long as America continues its aggression in Colombia...

173
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:19,584
... we will bring the war home to you.

174
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:23,296
And you will not feel safe in your own beds.

175
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,924
Colombia is not your country.

176
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:30,970
Get out now. Sangre o libertad.

177
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:35,850
For more, JenniLuz in Los Angeles.

178
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:41,648
I'm with Mr. Ortiz Dominguez of the Latin American Solidarity Committee...

179
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:45,652
...a group sympathetic to the Army of Colombian Liberation.

180
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:49,656
Sir, you've characterized the ALC as freedom fighters.

181
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:53,701
Isn't the bombing herejust a brutal act of terrorism?

182
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,331
The Wolfonly brought to the U.S. what the U.S. has brought to Colombia.

183
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,378
The killing ofinnocentpeople like Anne and Matt Brewer is terrorism.

184
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,589
Their deaths are regrettable.

185
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,218
It's called collateral damage.

186
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:20,979
Ortiz, you want the call? CNN is holding. Washington Post's on the line.

187
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:26,151
-Am I the only one here? -Agent Crosby will relieve you soon.

188
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,195
New York Times is on one.

189
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:33,575
Put them on hold. That's my position. l already told you this.

190
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:37,036
-Why should l change it? -Collateral damage, huh?

191
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:41,082
-Who the fuck are you? -l'll give you collateral damage.

192
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,834
Stop that!

193
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:47,130
lt looks like the fireman. Move in. Go now! Go!

194
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:52,677
You want collateral? Right here.

195
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:56,806
-What are you doing?! -Want collateral damage? Here.

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,975
What are you doing?!

197
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,394
-Where's The Wolf?! -l don't know!

198
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:05,023
-Tell me where The Wolf is! -Put the bat down!

199
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:06,900
-Fuck you! -Take him down!

200
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,485
l don't know!

201
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:16,242
Turn it off.

202
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,745
Come on.

203
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,247
Just relax, Mr. Brewer.

204
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:25,335
-l have to cuff you. -l'm Agent Collins with the FBl.

205
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,630
Bring your wrist right here, sir.

206
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,885
Take it easy. You'll be all right.

207
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,846
Just relax. lt's gonna be all right.

208
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:55,323
l can't imagine what you're feeling right now...

209
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:58,743
...but you can't take the law into your own hands.

210
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,413
l think you already lost him.

211
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:07,001
He's long gone. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent you that tape.

212
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:10,255
-Am l under arrest? -No.

213
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:13,716
We convinced Mr. Ortiz to drop the charges.

214
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:18,096
The truth is, we're pretty sure The Wolf is back in Colombia.

215
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:36,823
-l find this questioning offensive. -You are the reason this has occurred.

216
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:42,162
You went to the Colombian consulate with a plan to attack the guerrillas.

217
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,497
Then they tried to blow you up.

218
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:49,127
-Senator, if you intend to argue-- -Mr. Brandt, l'm not arguing.

219
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:54,466
l am telling you, your mission in Colombia is terminated immediately.

220
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:57,677
With all due respect, senator...

221
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,722
...that is the worst thing you can do now.

222
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,599
This isn't for discussion.

223
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:07,270
Peace talks are being arranged between Colombia and the guerrillas.

224
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:10,940
This is insane. You can't negotiate with terrorists!

225
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:16,112
These guerrillas don't want peace. All they want to do is sell cocaine.

226
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:21,117
Senator, Peter Brandt has had a great deal of experience--

227
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:22,952
Spare me, Douglas.

228
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:27,832
Brandt has failed. All he's done is bring the war home to American soil.

229
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,753
That is completely unacceptable, and you know it.

230
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:36,049
You have 72 hours to pull your operatives out of Colombia.

231
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:40,345
-Have you any questions, Mr. Brandt? -None at all.

232
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,768
Damn it, Pete! Come here!

233
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:52,065
Why call them Senate intelligence hearings? They're all imbeciles.

234
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:55,527
l'm going back to Colombia and kill them all.

235
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,905
We've been here before. You know the drill.

236
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,824
This will blow over.

237
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:04,410
For now you're being reassigned here to l-TAG.

238
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,038
You can find this animal, Pete.

239
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:12,836
Just do it via satellite. All right? You're okay.

240
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,390
l'm sick of this crap. Get the plane ready. We're leaving tonight.

241
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,434
Another guy's claiming he's The Wolf.

242
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,937
-So? -He asked for you by name.

243
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:36,025
And he knows unreleased details about the bombing. Take it over here.

244
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,870
-Who's this? -You're tough to reach.

245
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:49,914
-I tried for the last three weeks. -Brewer?

246
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:53,835
You've been busy finding the man who killed my family?

247
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,504
Right?

248
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:00,884
l understand you're anxious. We'll keep you posted.

249
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:04,804
Tell me the truth, Brandt. You owe me that much.

250
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,640
-You're not going after him. -The truth?

251
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:13,480
The Colombian government's trying to negotiate peace with the guerrillas.

252
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,525
We can't go in the guerrilla zone. So bottom line is...

253
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,280
...justice for your wife and son isn't a priority.

254
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:58,691
-Colonel. -Peter, good to see you.

255
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,027
l wasn't expecting you back.

256
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:04,906
l won't hand the country over to a third-rate Che Guevara.

257
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:10,829
-How are my boys? -They're dying to get in the field.

258
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:20,630
-On furlough from the psych unit? -lsn't this it?

259
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,550
-l need to talk to you. -Okay.

260
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:36,187
-Gordy, how you doing? -Come in.

261
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:39,858
Meet a friend of mine, Ed Coonts.

262
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:42,402
-l'm sorry about your loss. -Thank you.

263
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,823
Ed spent two years as a military adviser down in Colombia.

264
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:49,534
He can help you.

265
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:53,580
l see you're doing homework.

266
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:57,417
Well, if l don't do it, it seems no one else will.

267
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:01,921
You'd have to be freaking cracked to go there.

268
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:04,340
You can't even land in Colombia...

269
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,886
...without a State Department stamp on your passport.

270
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:11,181
You can bet you were on their restricted list...

271
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:14,100
...five minutes after that bombing.

272
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,937
Oh, yeah. Well, Panama.

273
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:23,526
Back door into Colombia. You have been doing some homework.

274
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:31,618
Let's say you managed to get into the country without getting killed...

275
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:35,079
...you'd need a pass to get into the guerrilla zone.

276
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:38,333
They're sure not going to give you one.

277
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,544
Well, let's say l got one.

278
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:47,175
lt would take them about two seconds to realize you're not Juan Valdez.

279
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:51,262
And they'd shove your head up your ass...

280
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:54,057
...and bowl you off a cliff.

281
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:56,726
Are you going to help me or not?

282
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,353
Tell me your plan.

283
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:02,774
I'll cross the border through the Darien Gap.

284
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:06,027
I understand thejungle is hard to patrol.

285
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:09,155
I can make it to Valencia in one day.

286
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:12,367
Then it's 200 miles to the guerrilla zone.

287
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:16,788
I can pay someone to drive me to Mompos.

288
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:21,167
I don't think so. Approach the wrong person, you're a dead man.

289
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:26,214
Next to drugs, kidnapping gringos is the mostprofitable business.

290
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:30,468
Get on a bus as fast as you can.

291
00:27:31,803 --> 00:27:34,848
-Mompos? -Si.

292
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:42,689
If you make it to the bus, you're doing all right.

293
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:48,862
-Thanks for your advice. -lt's only good advice if you take it.

294
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,831
-Que pasa? -Up ahead. Roadblock.

295
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,334
-Who are they looking for? -Anyone not like them.

296
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:32,919
His passport was found in his backpack when he escaped one of our roadblocks.

297
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:36,631
-He's committing suicide. -Only two ways he can go:

298
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,843
Upriver or on the road through Mompos.

299
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:43,680
lf we know he's here, the guerrillas know.

300
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:49,269
Or they will soon. l want you to make sure of it.

301
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:50,770
All right.

302
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:55,942
l give you 1 2 hours before we find your fireman facedown in a pit.

303
00:31:56,151 --> 00:32:00,989
Sure would show Washington you can't negotiate with terrorists.

304
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:10,748
Los Angeles was a great success.

305
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:15,170
Finally, the hypocrites want to negotiate.

306
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:20,925
Americans hide behind family values. False ideals.

307
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:25,972
They've forgotten the reality of war. Not like us.

308
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:30,768
They found his passport. He's coming to Mompos.

309
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:36,483
Excellent. Take a fireman from Los Angeles.

310
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,987
When America hears the story, they cry rivers of tears.

311
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:46,993
Capture him. We hold him for ransom, and they will pay.

312
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:51,998
Two teams. One at the harbor, one in town. Find him and bring him to me.

313
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,459
lf they don't pay...

314
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,711
...we kill him.

315
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:14,270
All roads end in Mompos.

316
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:19,484
The only way into the guerrilla zone from there is upriver.

317
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,378
How do l go upriver in that?

318
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:42,507
No one goes upriver. Not without a pass.

319
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,979
You said I need a pass to get in.

320
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,940
Tell me how to get one.

321
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,652
You may be able to buy a pass from a local.

322
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:05,864
God help you if you ask the wrong one.

323
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:12,787
Look, this is where Ipretty much run out ofgood advice.

324
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:16,833
Thanks. I'm going to figure it out.

325
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,667
What are you doing?

326
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,518
ls the boy okay?

327
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,896
Yeah, he's okay. But l don't need any help.

328
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:05,191
l was just concerned about the boy.

329
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,156
Sorry. You are very kind.

330
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:15,326
He gets so excited. l have trouble keeping up.

331
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:18,121
He couldn't wait to get to the festival.

332
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,207
This carnival, he loves.

333
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,043
-l'm Selena. -Gordy.

334
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,254
This is my son, Mauro.

335
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,131
Gordy.

336
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,592
Friend.

337
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:43,480
All right. Better get going. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

338
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:46,524
Mr. Brewer.

339
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:50,445
You have to come with me. You're on my list.

340
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:54,032
-What's this about? -You're here illegally.

341
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:57,285
No, l'm not. My passport was stolen.

342
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,789
See those guys over there?

343
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,665
They're guerrillas!

344
00:37:40,745 --> 00:37:43,414
Hey, no, seriously, captain.

345
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:48,044
l appreciate you guys taking me without a reservation.

346
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:50,588
l know how crowded it gets in here.

347
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:58,263
You know, l'd tip you, but your chief took all my money already.

348
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:05,061
-You gave away my favorite cell. -Put him next to the American.

349
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,941
That's not nice. Why'd you do that? Because he's bigger than l am?

350
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:14,988
Why are you doing this to me? l thought we had an understanding.

351
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:19,242
You're calling me a pervert?

352
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:21,828
l like you too.

353
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:27,000
Sean Armstrong. Public lewdness. At least, that's what they call it.

354
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:31,546
But l was just standing there. She was doing all the work.

355
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:37,135
Are you just quiet, or did somebody confiscate your tongue?

356
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,020
-Gordy Brewer. -Do l know you?

357
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:49,481
l doubt it.

358
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,066
So, what are you innocent of, huh?

359
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,444
l'm an illegal alien.

360
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:59,365
You goddamn gringos. You come down here and steal all the jobs.

361
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:03,495
Half the country wants to kidnap you. Half wants to kill you.

362
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:07,040
No one gives a shit about us Canadians.

363
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:11,377
Death squads kill the guerrillas. Guerrillas kill the military.

364
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:14,088
Peasants are killed by everybody.

365
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:18,510
But we Canadians, flies on the wall.

366
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:24,307
Hey, man. Don't even look at them unless you can kill them.

367
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:29,312
-They're all guerrillas, aren't they? -l did not say that.

368
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:31,940
That's what you meant.

369
00:39:32,398 --> 00:39:35,693
You work the guerrilla zone. That's how you know.

370
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,490
-Can l move to a different cell? -Doing what?

371
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,036
l fix and sell heavy machinery. You satisfied?

372
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:47,914
Sell me a pass so l can work the zone.

373
00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:51,543
Stick a sock in it. l'm just a wrench for hire.

374
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:55,713
lf anyone found out what l do, l'd be an organ donor.

375
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:58,091
My pass is not for sale.

376
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:01,636
-Thanks a lot. -Don't mention it.

377
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:07,559
Give me a list of everybody they picked up.

378
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:11,938
The guerrillas were after Brewer when the policia showed up.

379
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:14,899
Everyone we need in the same jail.

380
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,944
We should put this fireman on the payroll.

381
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:19,654
Seat belt.

382
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,789
l think we got some company coming.

383
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:57,794
Mompos Jail is under attack by guerrilla troops.

384
00:41:57,961 --> 00:42:01,965
Get a team outside the jail and two squads to clear the building.

385
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:03,258
Copy.

386
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:06,010
Goddamn it, l can't believe this shit!

387
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:42,732
What about the fireman?

388
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:45,944
Claudio, they're coming! We have to go!

389
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:48,446
Let him burn in hell!

390
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:55,912
Shit! We're gonna fry! We're gonna fucking fry!

391
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,970
That's using the old noggin! That's using the noggin!

392
00:44:12,554 --> 00:44:14,639
Yeah! Fuck America!

393
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:19,394
Good. That's good, baby. That's good! Get me out of here!

394
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:31,614
Let's play This Is Your Life. l want your pass.

395
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:34,617
lt's my livelihood! You'd let me die here?

396
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:38,163
l thought we were friends! lt's my livelihood!

397
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,290
You'd let me die here?

398
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:43,418
That's the last thing that will happen to you.

399
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:47,380
First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees.

400
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:52,886
Your pass will explode, your socks will ignite, your fingernails will melt.

401
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,764
All right, all right! Shit! Here you go!

402
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:00,101
lt's yours, all right? Take it.

403
00:45:00,268 --> 00:45:04,230
Now get me out. Get me out of here, please! Come on!

404
00:45:22,457 --> 00:45:27,212
Witnesses heard prisoners call for El Lobo. He was here, boss.

405
00:45:27,378 --> 00:45:30,799
He was into our hands and they let him walk out?

406
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,843
What good's a tower if nobody's watching?

407
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,845
The fireman isn't here.

408
00:45:36,012 --> 00:45:39,307
No kidding. The fireman escaped the fire?

409
00:45:43,311 --> 00:45:47,023
Look around. With any luck, Gordy Brewer's dead.

410
00:45:58,785 --> 00:46:00,995
l'm sorry l had to scare you.

411
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,707
Hey, l know when it's time to retire.

412
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,418
You weren't gonna let me burn.

413
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,964
What's this for?

414
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:15,802
For your retirement fund. And for additional information.

415
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,013
Tell me what l need to know.

416
00:46:19,764 --> 00:46:22,016
Get back to the harbor.

417
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:26,980
The guy who takes me upriver, his name's Omar. He'll set you up.

418
00:46:27,188 --> 00:46:30,233
ln San Pablo, ask for Felix Ramirez.

419
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:35,822
Say you're my replacement. Say that l was arrested for something raunchy.

420
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,325
Good luck. You'll need it.

421
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:11,733
Who did this?

422
00:47:13,276 --> 00:47:18,281
The guerrillas. They think these people help the paramilitaries.

423
00:47:57,111 --> 00:48:00,323
Put your hands up! And hold up your pass!

424
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,516
l replace Armstrong.

425
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:22,199
-You are not Armstrong. -That's for damn sure.

426
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:23,950
Felix?

427
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:26,828
Heinrich Beckmann, his replacement.

428
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:31,249
Says you, buddy. This is a serious breach of protocol.

429
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,503
l put in the papers, and this is what l get?

430
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:36,797
lt's like ordering a pizza.

431
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:40,300
Ask for Canadian bacon, you get German sausage.

432
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:45,097
lf you don't want me to fix your engine, l'll go back home.

433
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:51,186
Come on, come on. Don't be such a sauerkraut.

434
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:56,358
What happened to my man Armstrong? Maybe you brained him for his pass.

435
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:58,652
Armstrong was arrested yesterday.

436
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,447
He was caught screwing the police chief's daughter.

437
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:09,037
That's Armstrong. Double-dipping whore. l love that guy.

438
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:14,334
-l wish l were him. -l still can't let him through, Felix.

439
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:23,802
lf my generator isn't fixed, l can't pay my taxes.

440
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,431
l can't pay, your boss will make some cuts.

441
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:31,935
Now, it could be your salary, and it could be your throat.

442
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:35,022
l'll let you marinate on that, okay?

443
00:50:40,944 --> 00:50:45,115
Bring him back here first thing in the morning.

444
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,748
Danke.

445
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:57,919
Beckmann.

446
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:05,260
Don't forget your pass.

447
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,738
Your English is good for a German guy.

448
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:28,033
Thanks. When did you learn yours?

449
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:32,287
Oh, man, l been to New York, Chicago, Miami.

450
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:37,918
L.A. for a little bit. l want to go back someday when l'm a big shot.

451
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:42,589
l can't be begging some corporate asshole to put my CD on.

452
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,883
l want to cut an album, man.

453
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:50,263
lt's kind of hardcore campesino rap. Want to hear a little taste?

454
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:51,890
lf l have to.

455
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:56,937
With that attitude, it won't be a lot of fun. Here you go.

456
00:52:00,982 --> 00:52:03,193
Guerrilla thrilla Take me to Manila

457
00:52:03,402 --> 00:52:05,612
What do we got? Smooth like vanilla

458
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:09,533
Hottie, eenie-minie-mo Tell the CIA to go

459
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,618
They gotta get out, you know

460
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:16,415
-What do you think, man? -Great. l think you'll be a winner.

461
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:19,918
-Are you serious? -You're in the wrong profession.

462
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:24,131
l can't believe this. That's exactly how l feel.

463
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:30,679
-All right, here. Put this on. -What's this for?

464
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:35,767
For your protection. You don't wanna know how to get where we're going.

465
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:38,645
lt won't be more than 1 5 minutes.

466
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:03,754
Okay, we're here, baby. Don't get funky on me.

467
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:05,881
Peekaboo.

468
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,643
So, what do you think? Pretty snazzy, right?

469
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:21,897
-Where are we? -My place.

470
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:30,989
-lt smells here. -Profits, baby, profits.

471
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:33,617
-This is a cocaine plant. -l know.

472
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:38,497
Just because l'm brown and down doesn't mean l work for minimum wage.

473
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:42,292
lf l don't do it, Bolivia will. Bolivia don't, China will.

474
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:47,464
lf China don't, America will do it. Actually, they are doing it.

475
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:51,802
Jesus! l want to put you in my next video.

476
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:56,473
lt's the diesel generator. l should let it cool down...

477
00:53:56,682 --> 00:54:01,019
...but it's drugonomics. l can't crank it out fast enough.

478
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:04,773
Those Silicon Valley geeks must e-mail it to each other.

479
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:06,900
-That the one? -Yeah.

480
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:10,153
Armstrong was a magician with that.

481
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:13,657
-Don't worry. l'll make it work. -Let's hope so.

482
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:10,047
He told me his name was Heinrich Beckmann.

483
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:12,632
Heinrich Beckmann?

484
00:55:13,508 --> 00:55:17,387
He had a hat on. l didn't recognize him.

485
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:21,266
l made a mistake.

486
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,029
No! Please, Claudio! Listen to me, please!

487
00:55:34,488 --> 00:55:36,281
Claudio!

488
00:55:37,783 --> 00:55:40,035
ln the struggle for liberation...

489
00:55:40,202 --> 00:55:43,997
...there is no room for mistakes.

490
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:02,599
Discipline is everything.

491
00:56:02,808 --> 00:56:06,561
Discipline and punishment.

492
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:47,019
Find him. And no mistakes.

493
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:57,047
Come here whenever they want and barge in. l'm not a puppet.

494
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:04,763
-l thought l was paid up for the month. -Where's the mechanic?

495
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,266
Calm down, dog. You losing faith in me, man?

496
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:12,729
l got everything under control.

497
00:58:12,938 --> 00:58:17,818
l got him working his ass off. Germans are like cyborgs.

498
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,404
You seem tense. Need some R and R?

499
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:24,700
You got pull, you can get me a new generator.

500
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:27,828
Heinrich, l got some friends for you.

501
00:58:31,999 --> 00:58:36,003
My bad. l said if he fixed that gasket, he could take five.

502
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:38,588
He's probably in the latrine.

503
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:42,009
He's probably buffing the helmet.

504
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,346
Besides, he can't blend in. He's this big Neanderthal--

505
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:49,975
We'll get some rum, we'll hang out--

506
00:58:50,934 --> 00:58:53,520
What the hell was that?!

507
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:58,567
Get the mangueras! Get the pumps! Save the kilos, come on!

508
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:18,378
l'll work it out. l'll cut my losses, pay whatever it takes.

509
00:59:18,545 --> 00:59:22,549
l'll pay you three times the amount. l'll work it out.

510
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:38,889
No! Stay back there!

511
01:03:39,097 --> 01:03:40,724
Stop! Stay back!

512
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:41,975
Claudio!

513
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:44,144
No! Stop!

514
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:14,026
Rest now.

515
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:21,366
Who are you?

516
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:24,870
l'm his wife.

517
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:36,048
Get out.

518
01:05:49,895 --> 01:05:51,938
The fireman, huh?

519
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:56,276
The coward who kills women and children.

520
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:02,491
You Americans are so naive.

521
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:06,953
You see a peasant with a gun on the news, you change the channel.

522
01:06:07,454 --> 01:06:13,669
But you never ask, "Why does a peasant need a gun?"

523
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:19,758
Why? You think you're the only ones who can fight for independence.

524
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:24,471
lndependence to do what? To kill my wife and my son?

525
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:39,820
l remember your face from Los Angeles.

526
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,450
That was the face of a man who saved lives.

527
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:48,996
Well, your face has changed.

528
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:53,166
You think your wife and son would recognize you now?

529
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,627
l remember your face too.

530
01:06:57,921 --> 01:06:59,923
The smile...

531
01:07:01,466 --> 01:07:04,261
...just before you killed them.

532
01:07:05,804 --> 01:07:08,348
You're gonna pay for that.

533
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:12,019
You're gonna pay for that.

534
01:07:13,395 --> 01:07:18,358
Well, it seems we're both willing to kill for a cause...

535
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:22,154
...so what's the difference between you and l?

536
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:28,076
The difference is...

537
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:31,246
...l'm just gonna kill you.

538
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,394
Estaban!

539
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:58,231
Estaban!

540
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:53,453
-Why do you want him alive? -He saved my life and Mauro's.

541
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,622
What is the purpose?

542
01:08:56,123 --> 01:09:00,460
He's the enemy. lf they don't pay tomorrow, l'll kill him.

543
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:04,131
-Claudio, don't do this. -Don't argue with me.

544
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:09,219
-lt's not the right way! -Don't tell me what to do! Come back!

545
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:21,189
This is a satellite photo of San Pablo last night.

546
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:26,486
We got a large heat-and-light anomaly consistent with an explosion.

547
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:31,366
Two minutes later, building blows up. We got guerrillas, some down.

548
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:36,538
We have a big man down on the street, a woman and child.

549
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,499
And this guy. This guy gives the orders.

550
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:43,879
l can't believe it. Brewer found the son of a bitch.

551
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:48,091
A little later, an ALC convoy arrives. Everyone loads up.

552
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,136
They travel two minutes upriver. They stop here.

553
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:52,721
An ALC base camp.

554
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:58,352
We'll insert a platoon here. Use air support to box in the rear.

555
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:02,397
We'll come in through the treetops. Only 20 minutes.

556
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:04,274
Washington will know.

557
01:10:04,483 --> 01:10:09,696
We got a wounded American being tortured. This is a rescue mission.

558
01:10:10,697 --> 01:10:13,533
-We go in at dawn. -Roger that.

559
01:10:44,314 --> 01:10:46,942
Why are you taking care of me?

560
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:50,779
Because you saved my son.

561
01:10:51,446 --> 01:10:53,865
And your husband killed mine.

562
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,084
When l first met Claudio, he was a teacher.

563
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,628
lt was in Guatemala.

564
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:11,008
Sophia, our daughter, was born there.

565
01:11:12,676 --> 01:11:17,889
The guerrillas were all around us, but they left us alone.

566
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,894
One night, soldiers came to our village.

567
01:11:23,937 --> 01:11:26,606
They were led by American advisors.

568
01:11:27,232 --> 01:11:31,111
We crawled into the fields, but they threw grenades.

569
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,657
Sophia, our baby girl...

570
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:37,868
...she was hit.

571
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:42,581
She bled to death in Claudio's arms.

572
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:49,379
Mauro was orphaned that night, so l took him in.

573
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:57,262
Claudio joined the guerrillas.

574
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:03,352
And now he's a man consumed by hate and driven by rage.

575
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:06,813
Just like you.

576
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:10,484
l'm not like him.

577
01:12:11,234 --> 01:12:13,320
Not yet.

578
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:19,326
What about you? lf you keep working with him, you are no better than him.

579
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:23,914
-What would you have me do? -Help me stop him.

580
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,670
lt's too late.

581
01:13:47,497 --> 01:13:49,499
l'm trusting you with my life.

582
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:53,211
And my son's.

583
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:55,964
What are you saying?

584
01:13:56,173 --> 01:13:59,176
Claudio went to Washington to plant a bomb.

585
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:03,347
l can't be a part of it anymore.

586
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:06,683
They'll protect us, won't they?

587
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:10,645
lf they won't, l will.

588
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,025
Now!

589
01:15:01,405 --> 01:15:02,364
Let's go.

590
01:15:08,412 --> 01:15:10,497
Son of a bitch.

591
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:15,544
Eighth squad's on the way down.

592
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:17,129
Come on.

593
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:18,797
Hold your hover.

594
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:21,008
Insertion's under way.

595
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,724
Let her go!

596
01:15:40,694 --> 01:15:43,155
Target out. Setting her up.

597
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:48,285
We have to go upriver. There's a minefield over there.

598
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,585
lKeep firing! lKill them all!

599
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:01,590
-Stay low. -We're trapped.

600
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:48,553
Got them in the clearing Firing away.

601
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:52,140
-Copy that. -It's confirmed. LZ is secure.

602
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,652
Let's go.

603
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,892
Looks like an officer.

604
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,238
Get down!

605
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,035
lKeep your eyes open!

606
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:44,711
Stand down!

607
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:50,384
What we've got here is a great American.

608
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:58,892
Goddamn you, Brandt. l was your excuse to kill all these people.

609
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:03,522
You're here to murder a man, right? l'm trying to save a country.

610
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:07,734
-lKeep its poison off our streets. -By killing innocents?

611
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,195
l fight terrorists with terror.

612
01:19:10,404 --> 01:19:13,240
What terrorists? The Wolf isn't even here!

613
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:17,077
He's gone to Washington to blow up another building!

614
01:19:19,997 --> 01:19:21,581
What do you mean? Where?

615
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:26,128
l'll tell you as soon as l'm on a jet heading home.

616
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:30,799
And they'll come with us, because this is his wife and his son.

617
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:35,303
She's the only one that can identify the target.

618
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,752
l appreciate it. Thank you.

619
01:20:09,046 --> 01:20:12,299
Mr. Secretary, this just came in.

620
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:16,970
All right, NSA, ClA, Southern Command, they're at your disposal.

621
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:21,350
Washington Surveillance Command will assist with our search.

622
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:23,644
Stay on station. Be ready.

623
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,855
We got an audio-encoded e-mail. lt's authentic.

624
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,607
Run it.

625
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:34,488
My last warning went unheard.

626
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:39,701
The American people willpay for this mistake in blood.

627
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:43,705
A bomb has been placed in your capital city.

628
01:20:43,914 --> 01:20:49,044
By the time you hear this message, it will be too late for you to find it.

629
01:20:49,252 --> 01:20:52,422
And many of your citizens will die.

630
01:20:52,631 --> 01:20:57,719
Their needless sacrifice is the price of your ignorance.

631
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:01,390
There will be no mercy.

632
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,559
There's no place you can hide.

633
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,313
We 'll continue to strike until the American public...

634
01:21:08,522 --> 01:21:11,400
...finally realizes the price of this war...

635
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,611
...is one they cannot afford.

636
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,864
Get out of Colombia now.

637
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,075
Sangre o libertad.

638
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:50,439
Good to see you with all your fingers and toes.

639
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:52,357
This is Selena Perrini.

640
01:21:52,566 --> 01:21:56,528
-Agent Phipps. This is Agent Dray. -How do you do?

641
01:21:56,737 --> 01:21:59,114
-We'd like to get started. -Sit.

642
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:00,741
Good luck.

643
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,705
-Something to drink? -Water, please.

644
01:22:06,913 --> 01:22:09,458
All right, David, let's get ready.

645
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:15,005
We've assembled pictures of buildings with columns as you've described.

646
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:16,882
We'll go through them.

647
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:21,803
lf you see anything familiar, please give us a nod. Here we go, David.

648
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:42,157
These are photos of this building from different angles. Here's the facade.

649
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:46,995
Did he describe any activity in this building?

650
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:50,624
-No, he didn't discuss anything. -Ms. Perrini.

651
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,752
This is the same building, different angles.

652
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,381
-Can you zoom in on that? -l can't tell.

653
01:22:57,589 --> 01:23:00,801
-Take a look at this entrance. -That's not it.

654
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,053
Can you zoom in on that?

655
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:06,515
-How about this one? -No, that's not it.

656
01:23:11,228 --> 01:23:13,814
Does this look at all familiar?

657
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:15,732
-lKeep going. -l don't know.

658
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:19,361
You two make quite a team. Fireman and the refugee.

659
01:23:19,653 --> 01:23:21,989
Sounds like a TV show.

660
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,326
And you could play the asshole.

661
01:24:04,698 --> 01:24:08,702
All right. We're gonna let everybody know.

662
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:12,122
Secretary Ramsey's coming over.

663
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:17,210
Wait. Go back. Go back. There.

664
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,962
-This one. -That one?

665
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:21,423
-Familiar? -lt's this picture.

666
01:24:21,631 --> 01:24:24,384
Union Station. You got that?

667
01:24:24,843 --> 01:24:27,679
-Yes. -Here's another shot of it.

668
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,306
ls that it?

669
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:32,225
Go back two and zoom in on the entrance.

670
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:35,437
Look at this one, here's the entrance.

671
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:39,066
Oh, my God, l think so.

672
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:44,905
Eyeball footage from every station's camera in the last 24 hours.

673
01:24:45,155 --> 01:24:48,158
David, let's go back on that, please.

674
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,876
Let's go! Go, go, go! Pick it up!

675
01:25:33,954 --> 01:25:35,288
Don't get up.

676
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:38,417
Selena, Secretary of State Barbara Ramsey.

677
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:42,254
We understand the sacrifice you're making here.

678
01:25:42,462 --> 01:25:43,630
Thank you.

679
01:25:44,464 --> 01:25:46,842
-The fireman's over here. -Peter!

680
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,971
Madam Secretary, sir, l think we got something.

681
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,640
Dave, the file's in your active bin.

682
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:58,270
lt was taken off one of the Union Station monitors 13 minutes ago.

683
01:25:58,478 --> 01:26:00,605
-What is it? -First photograph:

684
01:26:00,814 --> 01:26:03,400
Man behind the trees with a briefcase.

685
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:07,487
Second photograph: goes behind the trees, briefcase is gone.

686
01:26:07,654 --> 01:26:09,448
Punch in on that.

687
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,786
On the face.

688
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,877
Yeah, that's him.

689
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,839
Tell our team the location of that camera.

690
01:26:26,465 --> 01:26:28,300
lt's almost rush hour.

691
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:05,045
Good afternoon, this is Shrub. Yeah, very urgent.

692
01:27:05,796 --> 01:27:08,840
Thank you. He's coming on line.

693
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,679
Yes, we've identified the target.

694
01:27:14,221 --> 01:27:16,890
l'll be leaving shortly.

695
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:27,567
l saw him over there.

696
01:27:41,248 --> 01:27:43,750
No media statement at all.

697
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,671
l'll cover here.

698
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,273
You did the right thing.

699
01:28:11,278 --> 01:28:13,739
-l hope so. -No, l'm sure of it.

700
01:28:13,947 --> 01:28:17,492
Look, it's something you had to do.

701
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:25,167
Right now, l don't feel very good about anything.

702
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,254
l'm sorry about that.

703
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:34,259
Look, everything will be all right.

704
01:28:46,813 --> 01:28:50,317
Excuse me. Can you show me to the restroom?

705
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:53,403
Sure. Follow me.

706
01:28:58,075 --> 01:28:59,534
Are you all right?

707
01:29:17,636 --> 01:29:20,347
He's gonna be fine with me.

708
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,562
Why don't you go ahead?

709
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,985
Mr. Brewer, l just want to express to you my sympathy.

710
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:19,239
As long as America continues its aggression in Colombia...

711
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:21,908
... we will bring the war home to you.

712
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:25,495
And you will not feel safe in your own beds.

713
01:30:25,704 --> 01:30:28,415
Colombia is not your country.

714
01:30:28,582 --> 01:30:32,252
Get out now. Sangre o libertad.

715
01:30:34,379 --> 01:30:37,132
Sangre o libertad.

716
01:30:38,592 --> 01:30:40,802
Oh, my God.

717
01:30:46,516 --> 01:30:48,727
Where's he going?

718
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:03,158
Don't open it!

719
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:12,292
You should wipe your nose off with that.

720
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:57,921
Selena!

721
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:09,975
Selena!

722
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:15,063
Stop her!

723
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:17,357
Stop her!

724
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:25,240
Open up the door! Open up!

725
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:32,247
Open up the door! Open up now!

726
01:32:54,895 --> 01:32:58,732
Everybody, clear out the room! There's a bomb in here!

727
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,068
Give me the toy. Under the table.

728
01:33:01,234 --> 01:33:03,862
-What are you doing? -There's a bomb!

729
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:07,532
Get back! Get back! Get back!

730
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:48,573
-Get the secretary out of here! -Close it down!

731
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:52,035
-Take care of the boy, okay? -l will.

732
01:34:22,482 --> 01:34:25,652
Please evacuate andproceed to the exit.

733
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:29,364
Attention, this is not a drill.

734
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:42,919
Move out of the way! Go!

735
01:34:52,888 --> 01:34:55,223

Exit using stairwells only. Do not use the elevator.

737
01:35:02,981 --> 01:35:07,027
This is not a drill. Do not use the elevators.

738
01:37:42,766 --> 01:37:46,353
lt's not working. Go back to the controls.

739
01:39:07,768 --> 01:39:09,269
lt's over!

740
01:39:09,853 --> 01:39:12,522
lt's never over.

741
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:06,780
So when are you going to kill me?

742
01:42:08,281 --> 01:42:10,283
Now!

743
01:43:33,033 --> 01:43:36,203
-lt's over. -For you, sir, l hope that's true.

744
01:43:36,411 --> 01:43:40,082
-Where's the boy? -Right here, sir.

745
01:43:51,385 --> 01:43:54,054
The first terrorist attack on our capital....

746
01:43:54,262 --> 01:43:56,848
Secretary of State Ramsey escaped unharmed.

747
01:43:57,015 --> 01:44:00,227
--discovered a vehicle in an underground garage...

748
01:44:00,435 --> 01:44:02,771
...loaded with explosives.

749
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:06,483
--confirmed the death ofa security official.

750
01:44:06,692 --> 01:44:10,988
The bomb was placed by Colombian terrorist, The Wolf.

751
01:44:12,072 --> 01:44:17,828
The White House announced that the president will award Gordon Brewer...

752
01:44:17,995 --> 01:44:22,958
...the Medal of Freedom, the highest decoration a civilian can receive.

753
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:28,880
Despite efforts to contact him, Brewer remains unavailable for comment.
