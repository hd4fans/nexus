1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
片名:终极面试

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,879
你是最棒的...
You deserve this...

4
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,679
绝对是
You do.

5
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,239
这是你努力的结果
You've earned it.

6
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,239
我无所不能 无所不能
I can do all things. All things.

7
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,279
快啊...
Come on...

8
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,719
快点 快点啊...
Come on, come on...

9
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,839
我是监考人
I am the Invigilator.

10
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,959
仔细听好我说的每个字
Listen carefully to every word I say.

11
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,919
我不会重复所说的话
There will be no repetition.

12
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,039
我不会为你们为了到这来所忍受的艰难经历而道歉
I won't apologise for the hardships you've endured reaching this room

13
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,679
因为那些压力和痛苦是必需的
'cause the pressures and pains were necessary.

14
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,759
在这种困难时期 适应能力是一项关键的特质
Resilience is a key attribute in these dark times,

15
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,439
如果你不能通过我们的筛选你也不会适合这项工作
and if you can't survive our selection process, you won't survive in the job.

16
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,439
许多优秀的应聘者在这个环节都被淘汰了
Many highly-qualified candidates tried to get this far and failed.

17
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,319
而你们却成功地留了下来
You have succeeded.

18
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,599
现在 最后的考验就在你们眼前
And now the final stage lies before you.

19
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,319
这是最后胜利前的最后一道屏障
One last hurdle separates you from your goal -

20
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,839
通过它 你就能成为我们中受人尊敬的一员
which is to join our esteemed ranks.

21
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,879
这项测试相对比较简单 但它却能决定
The test is simple in comparison, yet it will determine

22
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,399
谁能带着雇用合同离开这个房间
who leaves this room with a contract of employment

23
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,479
谁又会在离开后坐着大巴回家
and who leaves with the bus fare home.

24
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,999
通过这些考验 你们将了解到一些
Through these trials, you've gained some idea of the power

25
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,919
这个机构中有关权能的事 所以当我说
of this organisation, so believe me when I tell you

26
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,959
在这里没有法律 而只有我们的规则时 你们应该相信我
that there's no law in this room but our law.

27
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,359
这里只有我们定下的规矩
And the only rules in here are our rules.

28
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,119
只有一个问题向你们提出 你们只需回答出一个答案
There's one question before you, and one answer is required.

29
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,239
如果你试图与我本人
If you try to communicate with myself

30
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,159
或保安沟通 你将丧失竞争资格
or the guard, you will be disqualified.

31
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,799
如果你搞坏给你发的纸 不管是有意地还是无意地
If you spoil your paper, intentionally or accidentally,

32
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,079
你将丧失竞争资格
you will be disqualified.

33
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,959
如果你出于任何原因离开这个房间
If you choose to leave the room for any reason,

34
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,159
你也将丧失竞争资格
you will be disqualified.

35
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,719
有问题吗?
Any questions?

36
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
祝你们好运 女士们先生们
Best of luck, ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,079
我们给你们8个人80分钟时间
We're giving the eight of you 80 minutes.

38
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,639
你们用这80分钟来说服我们 让我们觉得你对我们来说是称职人选
80 minutes to convince us you have what it takes to join us.

39
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,159
这80分钟将决定你未来80年的命运
80 minutes to determine the next 80 years of your lives.

40
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,279
开始
Begin.

41
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,239
我还没写完呢
I'm not finished.

42
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,839
不 求你了 你不能这样啊! 正常的测试不是这样的啊!
No, please. You can't! This isn't a proper test!

43
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,319
求你了 让我重新开始吧! 给我个机会!
Please, I'll start over! Just give me a chance!

44
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,959
嘿...
Hey...

45
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,959
听着 听着 听着 都听着
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

46
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,799
他刚才宣布了什么不重要 你知道吧
It's not about what he said, you know.

47
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,559
重要的是他没宣布什么
It's what he didn't say.

48
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
"如果你试图与...
"If you attempt to communicate...

49
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,599
我本人或保安...
...with myself or the guard...

50
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,959
...你将丧失竞争资格 "
...you will be disqualified. "

51
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,479
- 他没说... - ...我们不能相互交谈
- He didn't say... - ...we can't speak to each other.

52
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,719
- 你们现在就在交谈啊 - 这是在搞终极脑筋急转弯还是怎么回事?
- Now you're talking. - Is this the ultimate mind-fuck or what?

53
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,319
- 有人想出答案了吗? - 没有
- Has anyone figured out the answer? - No.

54
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,839
答案不是重要的 重要的是问题
It's not about the answer. It's about the question.

55
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,039
- 问题是什么? - 我们还有74分钟把问题想出来
- What's the question? - We've got 74 minutes left to figure out.

56
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,679
如果这个问题只需要1分钟就能写出来我们才有74分钟把它想出来
If the answer takes one minute to write down.

57
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,519
如果要用73分钟把它写出来的话
If it takes 73 minutes to write,

58
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,919
我们就只有1分钟把它想出来
we have one minute to guess the question.

59
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,399
我们不用花太多时间写 我打赌肯定是你说的前一种情况
We're short on writing space. I'm betting it's the former.

60
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,999
我们得相互帮助
We've gotta help each other.

61
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,999
凭什么? 我们在相互竞争呢 为什么我要帮你来胜过我?
Why? We're in competition. Why should I help you to beat me?

62
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,519
当我们回答问题时可能是竞争对手
We may be in competition to answer the question,

63
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,159
但是我们在想出问题时得合作
but to establish the question we have to cooperate.

64
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,279
他们希望我们会相互合作 是吧?
They expect us to cooperate, don't they?

65
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,759
你希望什么?是不是你将得到这份工作
What'd you expect, you're gonna win this job,

66
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,279
然后拿着这份工作带来的丰厚报酬
with all the rewards that come with it,

67
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,959
而这些只因为你给他们交出了答案?
by giving them a little simple written answer?

68
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,839
事实与意见? 比较与对照!
Facts and opinions? Compare and contrast!

69
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
那可不是他们想要的结果
They're not looking for that.

70
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,479
这样的工作需要的是主动性
A job like this needs initiative,

71
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,559
观察能力...
observation...

72
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,519
协调能力
.. interplay.

73
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,719
- 团队合作 他说的对 - 我们可是面临着巨大压力啊
- Teamwork. He's right. - We're in a stress scenario.

74
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,199
搞得人稀里糊涂的 还搞倒计时
A confusing, time-critical situation

75
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,079
这肯定是为了测试我们的智商和适应力而设计出来的
designed to test our intelligence, and resilience.

76
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,719
- 为了将我们中最糟糕的人踢出去 - 也许是选出最棒的
- To bring out the worst in us. - Or the best.

77
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,999
我们应该相互帮助直到需要竞争的时候
We help each other until the playing field is open

78
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,719
然后哥们就各顾各的 没别的意思 姑娘们
then it's every man for themselves, no offence, girls.

79
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,159
- 都同意吧? - 好
- Are we all agreed? - Yes.

80
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,919
同意
Agreed.

81
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,359
- 来吧 甘地大叔 - 我的名字不是甘地 朋友 我叫...
- Let's go, Gandhi. - My name isn't Gandhi, friend. It's...

82
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,347
别在这说名字 反正不说真名
No names in here. Not real ones, anyway.

83
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,959
他们没在纸上写名字肯定是有原因的 对吧?
They're not written on this for a reason, isn't it?

84
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,719
那我们就用绰号吧
We'll use nicknames, then.

85
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,079
- 好啊 这样就简单多了 - 我们已经有编号了啊
- All right, let's make this easy. - We already have numbers.

86
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,119
是啊 还有真人现实出场
Yeah, and visual.

87
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,759
你就叫"小黑"吧
You're Black.

88
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,079
我是"小白"
I'm White.

89
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,359
你是"小棕"
You're Brown.

90
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,039
她叫"金发女"
We've got Blonde here,

91
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,719
那是"黑肤女"
Brunette there...

92
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,279
...我想你该叫"暗肤女"
.. Dark, I suppose.

93
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,999
最后 非常有幸我们中有个"聋子"
And last as well as least we've got Deaf.

94
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,759
- 最后这个名太狠了点 - 哼 管他的
- Tough last round. - Yeah, whatever.

95
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,119
有反对意见吗?
Any objections?

96
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,079
你是说对你那恶心 迟钝 充满性别和种族观念的陈腔滥调吗?
Apart from your grossly insensitive sexual and racial stereotyping?

97
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,759
如果你不迟钝 你就不会在这了 宝贝
If you're the sensitive type, you shouldn't be here, love.

98
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,079
我要"小棕" 不要"甘地"
I'll take Brown over Gandhi,

99
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,679
希望我们现在做的事对我们真的有帮助
I guess we're talking about something that matters.

100
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,439
那就是你没有反对意见了
I'll take that as a yes.

101
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,559
还有什么是他没有禁止我们做的?
So, what else hasn't he forbidden?

102
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,679
他没有禁止我们站起来 是吧?
He hasn't forbidden us to stand, has he?

103
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,159
- 好 我想来回走动也是可以的 - 那有什么用?
- Well, l guess moving about is OK too. - What's that gonna achieve?

104
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,719
不知道 小棕 不过坐着对我们也没什么好处 对吧?
I don't know, Brown. But sitting wasn't getting us anywhere exciting, was it.

105
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,799
会不会问题已经写出来了 只是我们看不到?
What if the question is written down but we just can't see it?

106
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,039
我也是这么想的! 多谢帮我说出来!
That's what l'm talking about! Thank you!

107
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,719
- 你是说像用隐形墨水那种东西写出来的? - 或者是像水印那样
- You mean like invisible ink? - Or a watermark.

108
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,199
- 有这个可能性 - 很有可能是这样 要不然问题在哪?
- It's possible. - It's probable. Where else would it be?

109
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,599
我们得用什么东西让它显现出来 比如通过光照发现
We'd need something to reveal it. Like light.

110
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,879
- 你说的"对" - 这些是卤光灯
- Right. - Those are halogen.

111
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,839
那些不是卤光灯
Those aren't.

112
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,119
灯又不咬你 你自己去啊
They won't bite, you know.

113
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,599
他们不会搞的这么简单 是吧?
They're not gonna make it that easy, are they?

114
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,919
时间不等人 他们能搞的有多难?
We're on the clock. How hard can they afford to make it?

115
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,319
会不会这铅笔不是用来写答案的?
What if the pencil isn't just for writing the answer?

116
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,340
会不会用它能让问题显现出来?
What if it reveals the question too?

117
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,999
会不会是用它把纸涂黑 就像涂印记纸那样?
By shading the page, like tracing paper?

118
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,039
- 试下嘛 金发女 - 不行 记得他说的吗?
- Try it, Blonde. - No. Remember what he said.

119
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,679
如果你搞坏给你发的纸 不管是有意地还是无意地...
If you spoil your paper, intentionally or accidentally...

120
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,519
你都将丧失竞争资格
.. you'll be disqualified.

121
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,319
有谁知道他说的把纸搞坏的确切定义是什么?
Is anyone certain they know what his definition of spoiling is?

122
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,759
我们得搞定麻烦 都想想办法啊
Look, let's crack this. Throw out some ideas.

123
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,959
会不会问题就藏在纸里
What if the questions are hidden in the paper,

124
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,719
但我们每个人得写出不同的答案呢? 他说...
but each of us has to write a different answer? He said...

125
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,639
只有一个问题向你们提出 你们只需回答出一个答案
There's one question before you, and one answer is required.

126
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,719
那个意思并不是说给我们的问题都是相同的
That doesn't mean it's the same question for each of us.

127
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,639
可能会有8个不同的问题和答案
There could be eight different questions and answers.

128
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,079
如果我们能找出其中一个问题 剩下的也都能找出来了
If we find one question, we can find them all.

129
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,559
没必要 也许8个不同的问题
Not necessarily. Not if our eight individual questions

130
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,799
只能用8种不同的方法找出来
can only be revealed using eight different methods.

131
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,839
也许我们根本就用不着合作
Perhaps we're not meant to cooperate at all.

132
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,439
这个观点我"喜欢"
I like that idea.

133
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,519
或是只有1个问题 印在我们中某一人的纸上
Or there's only one question, printed on only one of our sheets.

134
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,359
- 那我们就得要合作... - 你们消停会 来做个测试吧
- Then we'd need to cooperate... - Time-out for some testing.

135
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,115
大家都到灯这来
Everyone up to the light.

136
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,559
我跟你说了 他们不会那么简单就让我们得手的 是吧?
Look, I told you they're not gonna make that easy, are they?

137
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,639
除非你想给我们大家的灵机程度做个排名 小白
Unless you want to make a list of our brainwaves, White,

138
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,399
我觉得我们不应该争来争去的
I say we cross a few off as we go.

139
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,039
好吧
Fine.

140
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,519
让我来吧
Allow me.

141
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,039
谢谢
Thank you.

142
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,919
喂 和我们一起来搞啊 聋子!
Yeah, join in any time, Deaf !

143
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,119
你不喜欢闲聊 是吧?
You're not one for small talk, are you?

144
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,759
来 给我
Come.

145
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,199
放松点 看完就还给你!
Relax, you'll get it back !

146
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,399
瞧 我说过的 我们可以不考虑光照的因素了
Alright, like l said, l think we can strike light off the list.

147
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,719
光是有波谱的
Light is a spectrum.

148
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,919
有些光我们能用肉眼看到
There's light we can see,

149
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,519
但有些光我们肉眼是看不到的
but there's light we can't see.

150
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,639
比如紫外线 红外线 X光
Like ultraviolet, infra-red, X-rays.

151
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,479
好 如果我们看不到它 又怎么把它找出来呢?
Look, if we can't see it, how are we supposed to find it?

152
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,199
发光源肯定是能看到的 就算它发的光我们看不见 对吧?
The source must be visible, even if the light isn't. Right?

153
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,919
找一下这些灯的开关
Find the light switches.

154
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,159
没有 反正在这找不到 还有...
There aren't any, not in here anyway. And...

155
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,879
如果你出于任何原因离开这个房间...
If you choose to leave the room for any reason...

156
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,359
...你将丧失竞争资格
...you'll be disqualified.

157
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,959
肯定有办法让这些灯开启关闭的啊
There must be some way to trigger these.

158
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,519
这是个紧急状况备用灯
This is emergency lighting.

159
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,799
那我们来制造出一个紧急状况
So let's create an emergency.

160
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,599
那太冒险了
That would be very risky.

161
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,919
- 这总比什么都不做风险小对吧? - 他说的对
- It's less risky than doing nothing, isn't it? - He's right.

162
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,999
如果我们这样做又失败了 就不能恢复原状了 会变成漆黑一片的
If we try this and fail, we can't go back. Blackout.

163
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,479
我们举手表决吧
We vote.

164
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,279
把那些灯也搞掉
Those too.

165
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,279
好啊! 太好了!
Nice! Very nice!

166
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,439
蓝调酒吧 您想来点什么?
Touch of blue, what you wanted?

167
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,399
这是暗光灯
This is black light.

168
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,919
信用卡公司用这种灯来让他们的安全标记显示出来
The kind credit card firms use to reveal their security symbols.

169
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,919
哦 我们没有应聘去VISA信用卡公司真是太可惜了!
Yeah, what a shame we didn't apply to work for Visa!

170
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,799
- 我们的赌博可能会有回报的 - 是有回报
- Our gamble might have paid off. - It did pay off.

171
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,239
只不过不是以你想要的方式回报
Just not in the way you wanted.

172
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,599
你一有动作 房间就会做出反应
You acted, and the room reacted.

173
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,999
我们已经与房间有了互动 我们应该继续进行
We've entered a dialogue now, we should keep going.

174
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,079
是啊也许应该...也许不应该
Yeah, maybe... Maybe not.

175
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,479
不好意思 你说这会出现肉眼看不见的光
Sorry, it was invisible light you said you wanted here.

176
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,879
但是现在这光我看得他娘的非常清楚
'Cause this looks pretty fucking visible to me.

177
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,959
这种光的科学术语叫"近紫外线光"
Scientific term for it is "near-ultraviolet".

178
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,919
是没起作用 但总应该试试吧
It didn't work, but it was worth trying.

179
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,159
哦 如果情况不改变 我们走出这个房间时都会被烤成非洲鸡了
Well, if nothing else we'll come out of this with great tans.

180
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,439
我们得把这些灯也搞掉
We've got to knock these out too.

181
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,879
这些灯带的上端槽里没有发光
The top hives of these strips aren't lit.

182
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,199
来看啊
Look.

183
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,519
红外线 这是另一种办法
Infrared. The other option.

184
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,599
- 它也能照出什么吗? - 它比紫外线更少见 但也能照出东西
- That exposes something too? - It's less common than UV, but yes.

185
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,239
艺术历史学家们用它来反射出
Art historians use it to make reflectograms

186
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,199
油画作品底层的轮廓草图
of the sketch outlines beneath paintings.

187
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,719
如果发给我们的纸里也有好几层的话...
If there's a hidden layer in our papers...

188
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,559
小心点
Carefully.

189
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,799
我猜这回是不是应该叫"近红外线光"了?
Let me guess, "near-infrared"?

190
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,119
好了 大家再试一次
All right, everyone, try again.

191
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,079
- 有人发现什么吗? - 没有
- Anyone? Anything? - No.

192
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,399
屎啊!
Shit!

193
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,441
我们现在能不能别再往灯上想了?
Now can we please get off the lighting?

194
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,399
如果你提出个更好的办法就行
If you can provide a better alternative.

195
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,879
什么办法都行啊 我们已经浪费了4分之1的时间了
Any alternative. We've burned a quarter of our time already.

196
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,639
也许这公司是小日本开的 这个测试是考我们折纸手工水平的
Perhaps the company's Japanese-owned and this is an origami exam.

197
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,319
你请便吧 反正搞坏了也是你的纸
Be our guest. That sheet is yours to spoil.

198
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,279
对啊 不过只是"你的"纸
Yes, it is, but only your sheet.

199
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,039
- 那只是张纸而已 - 不 它现在不只是张纸了 是吧?
- It's a piece of paper. - No, it's more than that now, isn't it?

200
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,279
它现在是个实验材料
This is experimental material.

201
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,719
- 如果你搞坏了... - ..."你的"纸
- If you spoil... -.. your paper.

202
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,639
- "你的"纸! - ...你将丧失竞争资格
- Your paper! -.. you will be disqualified.

203
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,399
这不是我的纸 这是她的
This isn't mine. This is hers.

204
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,959
"这不公平啊!"
"It's not fair" !

205
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,079
现在她走了 所以...
And she's gone. So...

206
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,919
我涂...
Tracing...

207
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,199
哦 恭喜 金发女 你的主意也是屁作用都没有
Well, congratulations, Blonde. Your idea sucks too.

208
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,999
这些东西可能都是用来分散我们注意力的 知道吧
This could all be a distraction, you know.

209
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,119
我们可能没发现某些显而易见的东西
We could be missing something obvious.

210
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,159
好 好 好!行了!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All right!

211
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,559
灯没起作用 发光管也没起作用...
Light does not work, LED does not work...

212
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,679
液体!
Liquid!

213
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,799
哦 对吔...
Oh, yeah...

214
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
好的
Right.

215
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,439
舔这些纸 在上面弄上口水 把它弄湿 好吧?
Lick it, spit on it, get it wet, alright?

216
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,079
如果问题是水印在纸上的 我们得用些液体让它显示出来
If the question's watermarked we may need some liquid to bring it out.

217
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,919
- 你手上拿的纸怎么弄? - 你不会想知道的 伙计
- What are you doing with yours? - You don't wanna know, mate.

218
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,799
- 我们当然想知道 - 好 那你过来看吧
- Actually, we do. - Well, you can come and watch.

219
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,119
你还可以帮我把纸拿好 如果你喜欢的话
You can hold it for me too if you like.

220
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,159
- 虽然我更喜欢"金发女"来干这事 - 真恶心
- Though I'd prefer it if Blonde did. - That's disgusting.

221
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,159
"用任何必要的方法" 对吧 兄弟?
"By any means necessary", right, brother?

222
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,519
如果我们能这么做 那我觉得我们就应该做
If we can do it, I say we should.

223
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,719
你那么做不可能让问题显示出来的 尿是无菌的 你都可以喝它的
That's not gonna bring the question out. Urine's sterile. You can drink it...

224
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,479
- 真希望你会喝下去 - 好极了 撒尿比赛啊
- Wish you would. - Great. A pissing contest.

225
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,839
有东西显示出来吗?
Anything?

226
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,559
- 现在还不好说 纸都变黄了 - 把它拿起来让我们看看
- I can't tell yet. lt's all yellow. - Hold it up and let us see.

227
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,839
嗯 如果你借我个手套 我就拿
Well, if you'll lend me a glove, l'll oblige.

228
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,119
唉 我没什么主意了
Well, l'm running out of ideas.

229
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,639
这么容易就放弃了?小黑 还剩57分钟呢 你真丢脸
Giving up so easily, Black, with 57 minutes on the clock? You should shamed of yourself.

230
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,279
你知道吧...
You know what...

231
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,999
我们俩个能闭嘴吗?我们这还有人要考虑问题呢!
Will you two shut up? Some of us are trying to think!

232
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,079
终于 他说话了
At last, he speaks.

233
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,479
他是法国人
He's French.

234
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,279
- 你们看? - 这有人会说法语吗?
- Vous voyez la? - Does anyone here speak French?

235
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,119
你们看
Vous voyez la?

236
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,759
你能看见吗?
Can you see?

237
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,719
你看...?
Vous voyez...?

238
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,439
仔细看
Regardez bien.

239
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,519
- 你能看到这些东西吗? - 看见什么东西?
- Can you see it in there? - See what in there?

240
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,479
看见什么?漂亮的颜色?
See what? Pretty colours?

241
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,999
- 你自己 - 你自己
- Vous-meme. - Yourself.

242
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,039
你 你看
Vous vous voyez.

243
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,679
它让你看到了你自己
It shows you yourself.

244
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,999
- 是啊我们一共6个自己呢 - 别烦他 他又没对你做什么
- And then there were six. - Leave him alone. He's done nothing to you.

245
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,399
是啊他对我们解决问题屁主意都没出 疯子!
He's done nothing for me either or any of us flatten the matter. Nutter!

246
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,519
必须要清楚的看下去
Toujours y voir clairement est primordial.

247
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,199
去看明显是最关键的步骤
To see clearly is all.

248
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,279
好了 你够了吧 萨特! (法国哲学家 此为反讽用法) 行吧?
All right, that's enough out of you, Sartre! alright?

249
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,479
狗屁哲学家
Fucking philosophers.

250
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,399
感谢上帝 这是个实干家的世界 而不是空想家的世界
Thank God that this world belongs to the doers, not the thinkers.

251
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,359
既然我们在提各种假设 我也提一个
Since we're proposing grand theories, let me advance one of my own.

252
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,319
这不是个测验
This is not an exam.

253
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,719
在常识上来说不算是
Not in the conventional sense anyway.

254
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,359
瞧瞧我们这些人
Look around.

255
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,959
你再也找不到其它更有代表性的团队
You couldn't ask for a more representative group

256
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,879
有资格来进入这最后的考验了
to qualify for the final stage.

257
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,239
4个男人和4个女人进入到这个房间
Four men and four women entered this room,

258
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,319
我们分别有不同的文化和人种背景
all from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds,

259
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,439
而且都拥有不同的技能
possessing a healthy mixture of skill-sets.

260
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,039
真是太方便了 布局的太好了
How convenient that is. How staged.

261
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,039
你什么意思?难道是他们专门做了个局让我们几个聚在一起?
What are you saying? They rigged the tests to bring us together?

262
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,879
他说的是某种团体互动能力实验
Some kind of experiment in group dynamics.

263
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,559
- 你到底在说什么? - 我的意思是这只是个游戏
- What are you talking about? - I'm saying this is a game.

264
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,319
- 他们在我们身上下注赌输赢 - 好 他们是谁?
- And they're betting on us. - Right and who is "they"?

265
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,479
这公司的董事会
The board.

266
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,399
我猜他们这会正在看着我们呢
I guess they're watching us right now.

267
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,999
他们以前可能都是风险投资商
They'll be ex-VCs mostly.

268
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,639
也许他们终止了与托管公司的合作 在他们意识到
Probably left the incubator when they realised

269
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,679
他们投资的小企业已经赚了大钱之后
their little start-up had struck the mother lode.

270
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,559
搞这种权力把戏对他们来说肯定很爽 我敢肯定
It wouldn't get any sweeter than this, I'm sure.

271
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,719
于是他们就进入了公司的董事会
So they joined the board,

272
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,959
搞到了丰厚的股份
secured some big fat stock options

273
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,599
这样他们就有权利来享受点娱乐活动了
and bought themselves the right to have a little fun...

274
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,719
把我们当傻子一样玩
With us.

275
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,759
你觉得他们除了搞这种把戏就没别的事可做了?
You don't think they have better things to do with their time?

276
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,439
比如做什么?
Like what?

277
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,719
在他们那个位置上 钱不再是最重要的了
At their level, money ceases to be the prime motivator.

278
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,879
找刺激才是他们想要的
It's risk they live for.

279
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,239
他们都很优秀 就像我们一样
They're type A's, like us,

280
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,559
他们投资的公司把他们训练成这样的
and just as they were trained by their investment companies,

281
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,639
他们现在就在主意上押宝呢
they're still betting on ideas today.

282
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,199
在我们身上押宝
Ours.

283
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,719
谁会把问题解码出来 谁会一败涂地
Who'll decipher the question, who'll come up empty and fold

284
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,279
谁又会在重压下崩溃
and who'll crack under pressure.

285
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,479
你说的可能是错的
You could be wrong.

286
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,359
也许只有监考人在监视我们
It could just be the Invigilator behind there.

287
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,079
我们打赌?
Wanna bet?

288
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,279
如果我是你 我就不会和他打赌
I wouldn't, if I were you.

289
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,679
小棕说起话来像个赌徒 因为他本来就是个赌徒
Brown talks like a gambler because he is one.

290
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,879
而且还是个职业赌徒 对吧?
A professional. Aren't you?

291
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,879
你呢 暗肤女 是个心理医生
And you, Dark, are a shrink.

292
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,839
心理学还是精神病学专家? 我搞不清两者的区别
Psychologist or psychiatrist? I forget the difference.

293
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,319
精神病专家是给病人开药帮他们控制情绪的
Psychiatrists dispense drugs to control mood.

294
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,839
我是个很棒的人类行为学学生
I'm a qualified student of human behaviour.

295
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,639
那你应该明白我刚才说的那些事
Then you should know what I'm talking about.

296
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,679
拥有权力的好处就在于可以滥用权力
The point of having power is to exercise it in all its forms.

297
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,279
- 我们在这只是任人摆布的对象 - 那又怎么样? 说这些没用的!
- We're pawns of the Gods in here. - So? This changes nothing!

298
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,759
是啊...
Yeah...

299
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,559
这游戏总是要有人赢的嘛...可能会是团队的胜利
Games are played to be won...as a team.

300
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,999
是 也可能是某一个人的胜利
Yeah, or as individuals.

301
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,319
如果对他们来说唯一取胜的方式是让我们失败的话 那就没戏
Not if the only way for them to win is for us to lose.

302
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,439
我是说我们所有人都失败 你们想过这个可能性吗?
All of us. Have you thought about that?

303
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,839
你错了
You're wrong.

304
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,359
没有什么"他们"在监视我们
There is no 'them' watching us.

305
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,359
应该是这公司的CEO在监视我们
The CEO is hands-on.

306
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,959
他得事无巨细的处理对公司来说很重要的事
He micro-manages anything of importance to his company.

307
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,679
而这个筛选程序很不寻常
And this is no ordinary selection process.

308
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,759
因为我们都很特别
We're special.

309
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,999
如果说除了监考人外有谁在监视我们的话 那肯定就是他了
If anyone's back there besides the lnvigilator, it's him.

310
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,279
这公司其他所有人都只是他的马仔而已 董事会成员也一样
Everyone else is a secretary in his structure, even board members.

311
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,399
因为他就喜欢别人对他俯首贴耳
That's how he likes it.

312
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,039
你怎么会知道这些的?
How do you know all this?

313
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,079
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting time.

314
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,999
只剩50分钟了 我们在找问题上一点进展都没有
There's 50 minutes left, we're no closer to finding the question.

315
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,039
我觉得找出问题和我刚才问她的话有关系
Somehow I suspect my question relates to the question.

316
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,919
回答我的问题
So answer me.

317
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,719
- 你怎么会知道那些情况的? - 和你知道董事会的办法一样啊
- How did you learn that information? - Same way you learned about the board.

318
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,519
我才不了解董事会的事呢 我只是做了个有理有据的推测而已
I don't know anything about the board. I made an educated guess.

319
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,359
而你...你知道谁是CEO 他都喜欢什么 你怎么知道的?
But you...you know who the CEO is and what he's like. How come?

320
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,239
- 你怎么可能不知道呢? - 我们怎么可能知道? 我们都是猎头公司选来的 对吧?
- How come you don't? - How could we? We were headhunted, weren't we?.

321
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,959
- 怎么? 你不是? - 当然不是!
- Why? Weren't you? - Of course not!

322
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,719
我听说这有空缺的职位就应聘了 我还以为大家都和我一样呢!
I heard there was a vacancy and applied. I thought we all did!

323
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,399
你是说你想在这个公司就职
Are you saying you wanna work for this company,

324
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,519
通过层层选拔终于走到如今 而你却对公司没一点了解?
jumped through every hoop to get here but you don't know who they are?

325
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,759
我知道工资和福利 行了吧? 还有详细的职位描述
They listed salary and benefits, OK? the job description detail,

326
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,079
"世界500强公司之一 以高度的责任感
"A high level of responsibility in a Fortune 500 company

327
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,239
出产应用于核心服务行业的高端技术" 我就了解这些 行了吧?
manufacturing state-of-the-art technology in a core service industry". that's it, All right?

328
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,999
- 你就没想多了解点? - 当时不准问问题的
- You didn't wanna know anymore than that? - The deal was no questions asked.

329
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,638
是啊 我们相信了他们的工作人员说的话
Yeah, we trusted their agents,

330
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,199
任何人听到这种介绍都会跳槽来这的...
anyone would've done the same in our position...

331
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,679
任何...想往高处走的人都会的
Anyone with...balls.

332
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,439
- 你们都是应聘来的? - 是啊
- You all applied? - Yeah.

333
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,319
如果这公司名气这么大 还用做什么广告啊?
If this job is so prestigious, why they have to advertise?

334
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,279
- 他们没打广告 - 我们是通过我们的渠道了解到招聘信息的
- They didn't. - We have our sources.

335
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,199
- 看样子来竞职的人有点多了 你觉得呢? - 我不会对人多不多说什么的
- Looks like we're outnumbered, do you? - I wouldn't cry about it.

336
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,919
- 你现在相比我们来说可是占尽了优势 - 你不说我还真不知道我有什么优势呢
- You've the edge over us now. - I really had your word with on that.

337
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,079
你是被请来的 对吧? 他们是请你来竞争职位的
You're wanted, aren't you? They invited you to apply.

338
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,719
要我说的话 因为你竞聘的积极性这么高 我们才是处于不利地位的人呢
I'd say we're disadvantaged because you showed the initiative to apply.

339
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,879
我们现在在这方面都被你甩在后面了
We're behind the curve now.

340
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,759
告诉我们你都知道些什么 从全面的职位描述开始吧
So tell us what you know, starting with a complete job description.

341
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,999
- 我们应聘来的不了解那方面的情况 - 哦 是吧 你觉得我们会相信吗?
- We don't have that information. - Oh, right, you expect us to believe that?

342
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,439
关于职位的事情我们知道的绝对没你多
We don't know any more about the job than you do.

343
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,199
我们只知道些关于这个公司的事 相信我
We just know about the company and, believe me,

344
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,959
他们公司最低工资都比其它公司最高工资都高
the worst job with them beats the best anyone else can offer.

345
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,039
他说的对 他们是什么公司 谁是CEO 他都有什么成就
He's right. Who they are, who the CEO is and what he's achieved,

346
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,399
这就是我们被告知的情况
that's all you need to know.

347
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,279
好 那把这些情况说给我们听听
All right, so tell us about it.

348
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,959
我给你提供点线索吧
I'll give you a clue.

349
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,479
10年前 世界各地有许多本来很健康的年轻人
10 years ago a lot of healthy young people around the world

350
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,039
都得病了 病得奄奄一息
got sick and started dying.

351
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,879
这件事你可能早就知道了
You may have read about that.

352
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,199
然后 一位医学研究者研制出了一种病毒抑制剂
Then a medical researcher patterned a virus suppressant.

353
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,999
半年的时间 就把死亡率减半了
The mortality rate halved in six months,

354
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,639
而如今 他办的公司已经是最大的
and now his company is the biggest player

355
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,199
全球性医药企业了 营业额超过200亿美元
in the global health industry with a turnover of $20 billion

356
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,679
股市市值为600亿美元
and a market capitalisation of $60 billion.

357
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,199
如果这个公司是个国家的话
If it was a nation state,

358
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,719
它将成为全球第8大经济体
it would rank as the world's eighth largest economy.

359
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,919
而到明年则会升到第6大经济体
Next year that rises to sixth.

360
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,799
这你可能也早就听说了
You may have read about that too.

361
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,719
是Biorg公司!
Biorg!

362
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,479
80分钟...
80 minutes...

363
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,439
...决定你未来80年的命运
...to determine the next 80 years of your lives.

364
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,879
还记得监考人说的这句吧?
Remember?

365
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,479
他们做的事就是让人的寿命变长
Longevity is what they do.

366
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,159
转基因药物 基因疗法 微创手术应用
Antisense drugs, gene therapy, microsurgical applications.

367
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,799
瞎扯! 他们公司去年宣布中止雇用员工了!大家都知道
Bullshit!They announced a hiring freeze last year! Everyone knows that.

368
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,919
那只是公开说说而已 私下里...他们又开始招兵买马了
Publicly that's true. Privately...they're expanding again.

369
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,119
为将来的大项目做准备
Gearing up for a big push of some kind.

370
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,319
他们肯定是研制出了新的特效药
They've found a cure.

371
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,639
肯定是这样!
They must have!

372
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,559
生产部和市场部
Manufacturing and marketing

373
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,199
将会扩员3倍 这都是为了新药上市做准备
would triple in size for the roll-out.

374
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,559
那样我们所有人都会在这找到合适的职位!
There'd be jobs for all of us!

375
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,559
- 我们还不知道情况是不是这样呢 - 但这是有可能的 对吧?
- We don't know that. - But it's possible, isn't it?

376
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,759
如果情况属实的话 得到FDA的批准文件得多久? 你知道吗?
How long would FDA approval take?if it's true, do you know?

377
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,399
- 那方面的情况我不了解 - 等等
- That's not my field. - Hold on.

378
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,199
你为什么对这些事这么感兴趣? 你有什么事想告诉我们吗?
Why are you so interested? Is something you want to tell us?

379
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,879
如果你的意思是问"我是不是也得了那种病?" 回答是"没有"
If you're asking "Am I infected?", White, the answer is "No".

380
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,999
- 我很健康 - 不过你认识的某个人肯定得了那种病了
- I'm clean. - But someone you know isn't.

381
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,719
我们认识的人里肯定都有得那病的 要不然怎么会称其为"全球性流行病"
We all know somebody with the virus, that's why they call it a pandemic.

382
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,806
很好的托词
Nice evasive manoeuvre,

383
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:50,359
但我们实际上说的是你 还有你到这来的真正原因
but we're actually talking about you and the real reason you're here.

384
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,519
好的...那么 是你的什么亲戚得病了呢?
Yeah...So, what relative is it?

385
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,239
是你妈? 还是你爸? 你妹妹?
Is it your mom? Your dad? Your sister?

386
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,079
是我的男友 行了吧? 他没钱用抑制剂
It's my partner, OK? He can't afford suppressants,

387
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,479
而抑制剂卖给本公司员工是有折扣的 你现在高兴了吧?
but they're discounted to employees, are you happy now?

388
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,919
还有谁是为了寻求救济来这的?
So who else is a charity case here?

389
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,879
是啊 就算有人是也不会公开说的 对吧?
Yeah, you wouldn't speak up, if you were, would you?

390
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,639
没人会想像她一样在这监视器前自毁前程
You don't want to commit career suicide on camera like she just has.

391
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,759
这还得谢谢你的帮助呢
With a little help from you.

392
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,319
她的境况又不是我造成的 我只是把它给曝出来了而已
I didn't create her situation, I just exposed it.

393
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,853
无所谓啦 如果她有了正确的答案
Doesn't matter. If she gets the answer right,

394
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,079
一样会被录用的 和其他人一样
she's still hired, like rest of us.

395
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,279
真的? 谁说的? 他们?
Really? Says who? What...them?

396
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,119
- 如果我没记错的话... - 这里只有我们定下的规矩
- If memory serves me correct... - The only rules in here are our rules.

397
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
他们可以取消所有人的竞争资格 好不好?
They can disqualify everyone! OK?

398
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,599
他们可以做任何想做的事 而我们却对此毫无办法
They can do whatever they like and we can't do a thing about it.

399
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,759
所以啊...恭喜你!
So...congratulations!

400
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
你在没打破任何规则的情况下出局了
You've just disqualified yourself without breaking any rules.

401
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,799
他不会把你赶出去 但你已经被淘汰了 宝贝
He won't kick you out, but you're dead in the water, honey.

402
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,279
死翘翘了哦
Dead in the water.

403
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,679
别听他乱说 我们会一起通过测试的 知道吗?
Don't listen to him. We'll get through this together, alright?

404
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,119
谢了 不过我不需要你的帮助
Thanks, but I don't need your help,

405
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,519
因为我的境况不是我的弱点 而是我的优势所在
because my situation isn't a weakness, it's a strength.

406
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,799
我肯定以他们的聪明 肯定会了解到这一点的
I'm sure they're smart enough to realise that.

407
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,079
如果我能和公司的CEO谈谈的话
And if l could talk to the CEO

408
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,239
我会向他说明 治疗我的男友只会让
I'd assure him the treatment my partner needs will only deepen my commitment

409
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,719
我在以后的工作中对公司更加忠诚
to his organisation for years to come.

410
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,559
你真的以为公司的CEO在通过监视器看着我们吗?
You really think he's behind there?

411
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,359
他长年累月就待在办公室里
He's lived behind walls for years.

412
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,319
他核心圈子里的人自从公司股票首发(IPO)后就没再见过他了
No one outside his inner circle has even seen him since the IPO.

413
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,199
如果他想招个助理的话
If he wanted to hire an assistant,

414
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,799
他应该会用这种办法的
this is the way he'd do it.

415
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,639
你在搞什么?
What are you doing?

416
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,119
证明我的价值 你们也许都没主意了 但我还有呢
Proving my worth. You may have run out of ideas, but I haven't.

417
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,759
- 别和他说话 - 我又没打算和他说话
- Don't even try talking to him. - I'm not gonna talk to him.

418
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,199
是他那有东西吸引你过去呢 还是他想让你过去找他?
Is there anything in there, or is he happy to see you?

419
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,599
看看找到了什么?
What have we here?

420
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,119
只有这个?
Is that all?

421
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,119
加热也许会让纸有反应
Heat may have an effect

422
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,919
如果这些纸是经过化学处理了的
if the papers have been chemically treated.

423
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,639
- 如果我们从下方给其加热的话... - 不是加热和化学反应 小黑
- If we warmed them from beneath... - It's not heat and chemicals, Black.

424
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,999
只是化学反应而已
It's just chemicals.

425
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,479
你说的是什么意思啊? 水?
What are you talking about? H2O?

426
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,159
水涂纸上已经试过了! 刚才用口水试的!
We already tried H2O! It's in all our bodily fluids!

427
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,176
咱们又不知道这上面的管子是接到哪的
We don't know what these pipes connected to?

428
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:24,239
喷什么液体下来都有可能啊!
You could pump any liquid through them!

429
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,999
试试吧 "爱因斯坦"
Come on, Einstein

430
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,199
天啊 你说的对
Good Lord, you're right.

431
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,279
这些根本就不是红外线
These aren't infrared at all.

432
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,799
这些是安全灯! 标准而普通的安全灯!
They're safelights! Common standard-issue safelights!

433
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,399
我们这是在暗房里! 这间屋子是个大暗房!
We're in a darkroom! This room is a great big darkroom!

434
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,719
- 这些纸肯定是照片纸 - 那我们可以冲洗这些纸让它们成像吗?
- And this must be photographic paper. - Meaning we can develop it?

435
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,799
做梦呢吧...洗照片可不是一个步骤就可以完成的
You hope... Developing photos isn't a one-stage process.

436
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,879
- 那得用化学药水洗 再用修正药水... - 那是洗彩色照片时用的方法
- It takes chemical baths, fixing agents... - For colour photography.

437
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,359
要让黑字从白色背景中显示出来
To pull black letters from a white background

438
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,239
只需要有显影液就行了 其它什么都不用
all you need is developing fluid, nothing more.

439
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,839
我们开始干吧
Let's do this.

440
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,879
我入伙
I'm in.

441
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,790
就算她说的对
Even if she's right,

442
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,279
我在想化学物质喷到我们身上会不会不好啊?
the idea you want to think is a chemical shower a bad idea?

443
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,239
喷的劲不会太大的 我担心的是他们会不会让我们出钱修被损坏的东西
It'll be diluted. I doubt they want to hire damaged goods.

444
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,279
不过还是把眼睛 鼻子和嘴巴遮起来比较好
But covering your eyes, nose and mouth may be wise.

445
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,079
恐怕不止应该只遮这几个地方吧
They're not the only things worth covering.

446
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,479
我就知道 事情有眉目了你就现身了
That's it, join in at last.

447
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,719
你是聋子又不是哑巴 嗯?
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

448
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,239
别担心 宝贝 我来想办法
No worries, love. Let me.

449
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,039
行了
Let's go.

450
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,359
- 怎么样? - 得等会才能有效果
- Well? - It'll take a few moments.

451
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,839
我的纸呢?
Where's my paper?

452
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,239
谁看到我的纸了?
Has anyone seen my paper?

453
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,079
不!
No!

454
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,039
你个杂种! 杂种!
You bastard! Bastard!

455
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,239
你怎么能这么做? 你怎么能这么做? 杂种!
How could you? How could you? Bastard!

456
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,439
你刚才做了什么?
What did you just do?

457
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,319
做的是我必须做的事
What l had to.

458
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,719
我真应该把你打得晕死过去!
I should punch you lights out!

459
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,999
- 小黑 你做什么了? - 这和小黑做了什么没关系
- Black, what did you do? - It's not what he did.

460
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,839
- 这和他说了什么有关系 - 什么?
- It's what he said. - What?

461
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,319
他刚才说了"熄灯" 看 开灯!
"Lights out". So...lights up!

462
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,319
- 这样好多了 - 关灯
- That's better. - Lights out.

463
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,599
开灯 这是声控的
Lights up. Voice-activated.

464
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,079
- 他们在逗我们玩呢 - 这声控系统还真棒 是吧?
- They're playing with us. - Great, isn't it?

465
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,719
- 从现在开始大家都得注意下自己说的话 - 还有自己做的事
- And from now everybody watch what you say. - And do.

466
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,599
这可真是祸从天降啊
Up one minute, down the next.

467
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,119
这上面写不成了 是吧?来 试一下吧
Can't write on this anymore, can you? Go on, try.

468
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,679
别试了
Don't then.

469
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,039
你饿吗 伙计? 喂 你饿不饿啊?
Are you hungry, mate? Oi, are you hungry?

470
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,759
我饿啊 我真饿死了
I am. l'm really hungry.

471
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,919
不过这没有加工快餐的机子 是吧?
There's no snack machines in here, though, are there?

472
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,599
继续啊 把这纸扯碎...喂!扯碎它!
Go on, rip it up...Oi! Rip it up!

473
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,679
- 嘿!我刚才给你说什么了? - 她让你别烦他 小白
- Hey! What did I tell you before? - She said leave him alone, White.

474
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,479
- 对 拿着 撕碎它! - 小白 你能不能停下来!
- Yes, hold it, tear it up! - White, will you stop!

475
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,159
撕碎它! 撕啊!
Tear it up! Tear it!

476
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,919
我警告你最后一次 小白!
I won't tell you again, White!

477
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,799
这就对了 好孩子 继续啊
That's it, good boy. Go on.

478
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,119
继续啊 再来 再来
Go on. More, more.

479
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,079
放到你嘴里去
Put it in your mouth.

480
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,919
麻烦你
S'il vous plait!

481
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,119
这下只剩咱们5个人了
And then there're five.

482
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,239
- 说你是杂种真是在夸你
- "Bastard" doesn't do you justice.

483
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,039
是你说我们在找出问题前应该合作的!
You said we should cooperate until we discovered the question!

484
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,159
我那是谎话!
So I lied!

485
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,279
我撒谎了 那又怎么样?
I lied. So what?

486
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,319
说谎又不违反规则 对吧?
Lying is not against the rules, is it?

487
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,279
反正我说什么你们也不会听 更不会同意或遵从我的意思
Anyway, you don't have to listen to me, let alone agree or obey.

488
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,679
你们应该感谢我 你们每个人都应该感谢我
You should thank me. All of you should thank me.

489
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,439
我把竞争范围缩小了 你们这些剩下的机会不就变大了
I've just narrowed down the field, so your odds improve.

490
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,439
没有问题摆出来 机会有个屁用!
Odds mean nothing without the question in front of us!

491
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,639
还有 你别指望我们会帮你找出问题
And you can forget about any more help from us in finding it.

492
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,079
我才不用你们帮忙呢 到时候你会发现是你需要我的帮助
I don't need your help. I think you'll find it's you who needs my help.

493
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,759
知道为什么吗? 因为我已经把它想出来了
You know why? Cause I figured it out.

494
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,999
哦 真的? 把问题想出来了? 问题是啥? 说给我们听听
Oh, really? The question? What is it, then? Tell us.

495
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,799
为什么要说给你们听?
Why should I?

496
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,039
因为如果你不说 我会打的你说
Because if you don't, I'll beat it out of you.

497
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,959
你真是垞屎 小白 刚进这屋我就闻到你身上的屎味了
You're full of shit, White. You have been from the start.

498
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,119
你屁都没想出来
You don't know anything.

499
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,479
他想出来也不会告诉我们的 因为他是个自恋狂
He wouldn't tell us if he did, 'cause he's a narcissist.

500
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,039
他看不起我们
He despises us.

501
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,719
说的跟真的一样啊 宝贝
Sticks and stones, love.

502
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,159
我打赌你肯定对所有的男生都是这个看法 是吧?
I bet you say that to all the boys, don't you?

503
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,839
我只对有自恋病态人格的人持这种看法
Only the ones with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

504
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,119
你这种人有9种个性特征:
There are nine character traits to look for:

505
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,719
自大 好大喜功 觉得自己是独一无二的
arrogance, grandiosity, a belief in one's uniqueness,

506
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,239
急于得到权力 获得成功
a preoccupation with power and success,

507
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,599
过于渴望被崇拜 希望得到认可
an excessive need to be admired, a sense of entitlement,

508
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,799
缺乏替人着想之心 还有嫉妒和压榨他人的双重倾向
lack of empathy and the twin tendencies to envy and exploit others.

509
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,479
做为临床诊断来说 有5种以上特征就是病人了
For clinical diagnosis, a patient must exhibit five of these.

510
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,359
- 你是绰绰有余了 - 你可以再加个第10种特征
- You tick enough boxes. - You can add a tenth to that list.

511
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,919
"有看穿你身边所有屁话的能力
"A tendency to see through all the bullshit surrounding you,

512
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,839
还能从屁话中脱颖而出 "
and rise above it. "

513
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,719
- 这一条我自认了 - 我来帮你认清楚吧
- I'll tick that box myself. - Let me tick it for you.

514
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,959
- 你那样做可真是"聪明"啊 - 这样做很有必要
- That was smart. - That was necessary.

515
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,399
我们可能会用得上他呢 他只是个资源而已
We may need him. He's a resource, nothing else.

516
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,999
你不喜欢某人的话 要智取他
You don't like someone, Outwit them.

517
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,719
他是我们团队的敌人 还是个让人分神的东西!
He's an enemy of the group, and a distraction!

518
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,159
你不来帮我一把吗?
You gonna give me a hand?

519
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,879
-1 2...
- One, two...

520
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,199
你搞什么?
What are you doing?

521
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,079
确保他醒过来后不会再制造任何麻烦
Ensuring that he can't cause any more trouble when he wakes up.

522
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,439
- 然后再让他被淘汰掉 - 这看起来可不太公平啊
- And taking him out of the game. - That hardly seems fair.

523
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,079
这是他该得的报应 只不过报应来的有点狠罢了
He sacrifices his right for payment. Forward a bit.

524
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,359
看到了吧? 我把他放倒了然后我们又一起合作开了
See?I put him down and suddenly we're cooperating again.

525
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,519
他是个大嘴巴
He's a talker.

526
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,039
我们还能再往狠点干
We could go further than this.

527
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,559
她说的对
She's right.

528
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,959
我们可以把他拖到门那 把他推出去
We could carry him to the door and slide him out.

529
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,759
他把8个中的2个人搞出局了 为什么我们不能把他也搞出局?
He ejected two of us, why shouldn't we eject him?

530
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,719
- 叫正义也好 如果你喜欢叫因果报应也行 - 你不会原谅别人吗?
- Call it justice, or karma if you prefer. - You don't believe in forgiveness?

531
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,879
- 我情愿以后再原谅他 - 那你所倡导的合作精神呢?
- I'll be happy forgive him afterwards. - And your gospel of cooperation?

532
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,599
我宽容任何人 但决不宽容对别人不宽容的人
I'll tolerate anyone, except the intolerant.

533
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,519
这是我最爱的圣经语录...
Those in favour...

534
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,439
一半对一半
Fifty-fifty.

535
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,519
那我们各行其事吧
To each his own.

536
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,559
好了 如果你不能抛开个人好恶来想这事 那你考虑下自身利益吧
OK, if you can't think selflessly about this, think selfishly.

537
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,399
监考人说过...
The Invigilator said...

538
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,439
如果你因任何原因离开这个房间
If you choose to leave this room for any reason,

539
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,519
你将丧失竞争资格
you'll be disqualified.

540
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,159
他没选择离开房间 是吧? 是你替他做了选择
He's not choosing to leave, is he? You're choosing for him.

541
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,239
这样的话 你也有被淘汰的危险了
Which puts you at risk too.

542
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,599
来吧 小白 把你的纸搞坏 现在轮到你了
Go on, White, spoil yourself. It's your turn.

543
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,959
画啊
Make your mark.

544
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,793
瞧 我们的时间只剩不到半小时了
Look, we have less than half an hour left

545
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:42,439
而我们还是不知道问题
and we still don't know the question.

546
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,479
他宣称自己知道问题
He claims to know the question.

547
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,879
闭上鸟嘴!
Shut up!

548
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,319
我得吃药 药在我口袋里
I need medication, it's in my pocket.

549
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,839
- 什么药? - 跟你有什么关系?
- What kind of medication? - What does it matter?

550
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,559
是口服药 行了吧? 每隔1小时就得吃一次 现在已经到点了 好吗?
It's a pill, all right? I need to take it every hour, on the hour, OK?

551
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,999
- 我现在就得吃 - 每隔1小时 现在吃?
- That's right now. - Every hour, on the hour?

552
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,119
只有一种情况下才会用这种治疗方法
Only one condition is treated that way.

553
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,559
你也得了那种病 是吧?
You're infected too, aren't you?

554
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,759
这可真是太公正了 这种公正太美妙了
That's more than justice. That's poetic justice.

555
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,439
如果你不信 松开我的胳膊 我他妈就能拿到药片了!
If you don't believe me, untie my arms, so I can fucking take the pill!

556
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,919
- 快啊! - 别做梦了
- Go on! - Nice try.

557
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,919
真是可悲啊
It's pathetic, actually.

558
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,799
好吧 你来拿 你拿给我 药在我左边口袋里
alright, take it yourself. Get it for me yourself. It's in my left pocket!

559
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,119
- 你想怎么样我都照做 快先帮我拿药 - 真的?
- I'll do what you want. Just do it. - Really?

560
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,079
那先告诉我们问题是什么
Tell us what the question is then.

561
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,479
好吧 把药拿出来我就告诉你
Alright, get the pill and I'll tell you.

562
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,759
快啊! 快他妈拿药给我!
Come on! Fucking do it!

563
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,559
快 在我左边口袋里
Go on, it's my left pocket.

564
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,999
快啊再找找 药就在那呢 快啊
Go on, try again, it's in there. Go on.

565
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,159
药他妈的到哪去了?
Where the fuck is it?

566
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,479
你们有人把药拿走了! 有人他妈的把我药拿走了!
One of you has taken it! One of you has fucking taken it!

567
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,787
这可不是闹着玩的!
This isn't funny!

568
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:29,559
你们都知道病人没吃抑制剂会怎么样!
You know what happens when you don't take suppressants!

569
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,479
不省人事 抽搐 休克 昏迷 死亡
Unconsciousness. Convulsions. Shock. Coma. Then death.

570
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,159
我们非常清楚会怎么样
We know exactly what happens,

571
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,919
而这一系列过程要持续几个小时呢 不是几分钟的事
and the process takes hours, not minutes.

572
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,679
听着 伙计 我会自动退出竞争的 好吧?
Listen, mate, I'll be out of it for good, alright?

573
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,479
这是以你之道还施你身
A taste of your own medicine.

574
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:57,559
- 别这样 别这样 - 往好的方面看 兄弟!
- Don't do it, don't do it. - Look on the bright side, brother!

575
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,879
如果你开始抽筋 我们才知道你说的是实话啊
If you start to convulse, we'll know you're telling the truth.

576
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,679
那我们将会乐于帮助你
Then we'll gladly help you.

577
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,759
看样子你的愿望得到满足了
Looks like you've got your wish.

578
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,479
只是暂时的而已
For now.

579
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,679
必须得用什么办法得把他收拾一下
He had to be dealt with one way or another.

580
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,839
如果他是这公司派来的奸细 我一点都不会觉得奇怪
I wouldn't be surprised if he was a plant all along.

581
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,079
他就是他们想要的 用来煽动我们情绪的那种人
It's the kind of thing they'd do to stir up our internal dynamics.

582
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,279
煽动我们相互敌对
To set us against one another.

583
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,839
如果他真是奸细 收拾了他主动权就在我们这了
If so, we've seized back the initiative.

584
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,719
也许是你掌握了主动权
Or you have.

585
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,799
他还没聪明到能做名奸细
He isn't smart enough to be a plant.

586
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,879
而你在某些方面却更合适做奸细
But you on the other hand.

587
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,039
你认为她和他们是一伙的?
You think she's one of them?

588
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,759
别搞笑了! 我说了我是个心理学学生!
Don't be absurd!I told you l'm a psychologist!

589
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,399
你声称自己只是个心理学学生 而不是实习医生
You claimed to be a qualified student of psychology, not a practitioner.

590
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,679
我也学过心理学 我学的是逆向心理学
I've studied psychology too, and reverse psychology.

591
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,759
有什么方法能掩盖你在这场闹剧中的真实身份
What better way to hide your true role in this farce

592
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,759
比指责在扮演你的角色的其他竞争者更有效呢?
than to accuse another candidate of playing your part?

593
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,799
我不明白你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

594
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,759
业余心理学知识对一个赌徒来说是件有用的工具
Amateur psychology is a useful tool for gamblers,

595
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,599
而你取得心理学的学位
but a degree in the subject

596
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,479
那可真是开始职业生涯的良好基础 你可是高级人力资源
sounds like the perfect foundation for a career in, say human resources.

597
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,039
但你却到这来 这很说不通 对吧?
You're on the wrong side of the glass, aren't you?

598
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,439
- 他才是想要操控的那个人... - 也许你看起来团队合作性很好
- He's the one who manipulated... - Maybe you work as a team.

599
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,279
他只会耍耍嘴皮子而已 而你...
He's got the mouth, but you...

600
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,199
...却知道那么多有关Biorg制药公司的事
...know an awful lot about Biorg Pharmaceuticals.

601
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,159
- 我说了我是应聘来的! - 我们也是啊
- I told you I applied! - So did we.

602
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,999
- 我做了相关调查的! - 我们也做了的!
- And I do my research! - So did we!

603
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,759
我们中可能是有奸细 不过不可能我们全都是
Anyone of us could be plants, but not all of us.

604
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,199
至少应该有一个竞争者是为了求生活而来参加这个测试的
At least one candidate has to be genuine for the test to be viable.

605
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,119
- 那肯定就是我啊 - 我也是啊
- That would be me. - And me.

606
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,239
我说的意思是我们现在无法证明谁是或不是奸细
My point is we can't prove anyone's guilt or innocence,

607
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,199
所以试着去证明只会浪费时间
so it's a waste of time to try.

608
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,959
如果我们之间不能保持信任与合作的话 那我们都会完蛋的
If we can't maintain trust and cooperation, we're through.

609
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,439
信任是要用行动来获取的 MM
Trust has to be earned, sister.

610
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,879
本来我们也没有理由相互信任的
We never had cause to trust each other in the first place.

611
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,559
信任只是一种选择 我们可以选择进行合作 如果必要的话
Trust is a choice. We can choose to keep cooperating, if necessary.

612
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,559
- 我觉得是有这个必要的 - 我们没有其它的选择
- I think it's necessary. - We have no other option.

613
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,639
信任别人让我紧张
Trust makes me nervous.

614
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,319
- 我情愿选择去证实 - 你在干什么啊?
- I prefer proof. - What are you doing?

615
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,799
- 放开我! - 你疯了吗?
- Get off me! - Are you insane?

616
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,399
- 小棕 你为什么要这么做啊? - 因为我喜欢胜出!
- Brown, why are you doing this? - Because I like winning!

617
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,839
现在把真象说出来吧 暗肤女
Now tell us the truth, Dark.

618
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,199
求你们了 你们说过我们应该相互信任的!
Please, You said we have to trust each other!

619
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,519
现在你们就看着他在这审讯我 什么也不做吗?
Now you're gonna stand there while he interrogates me?

620
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,559
看样子他们不会帮你的 他们也想知道真象啊
Looks like it. They wanna know too.

621
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,159
继续死不认帐只会浪费时间
Further denials will only waste time.

622
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,599
坦白的话我就放了你 我保证
Confess and l'll release you. I promise.

623
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,199
好吧 我是为他们工作的 但他们没派我到这来!
OK, I work for them, but they didn't put me in here!

624
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,679
我是通过内部消息知道这个职位在招人 然后就象其他人一样来应聘了!
I heard about the job internally and applied like everyone else!

625
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,399
你和我们可不一样
Not everyone.

626
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,879
把我们想知道的所有事都说出来
Tell us what we want to know.

627
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,799
我什么都不知道怎么可能告诉你什么事啊!
I can't tell you anything because I don't know anything!

628
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,839
公司人力资源部(HR)不管CEO办公室的人员配备 CEO亲自招聘他下面的人!
HR doesn't cover the CEO's office, he hires his staff personally!

629
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,599
我没说谎! 我也象你一样想往公司高层爬!
I'm not lying! I wanna step up as badly as you do!

630
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,239
我说过的 信任在这一文不值
Like I said, trust is a devalued currency in here.

631
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,959
那我怎么样才能向你证实我说的话呢?
What proof can I possibly give you?

632
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,639
你看 很有趣啊...
You know, it's funny...

633
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,079
一件简单而无害的东西
how something so simple and inoffensive

634
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,599
比如这张纸
as a piece of paper,

635
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,559
如果被居心不良的人拿着
when placed in the wrong hands

636
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,239
就会成为一件致命的武器
can become a deadly weapon.

637
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,079
而加工这武器的原料却来源于树
All from one slice of a tree.

638
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,599
- 你做什么? - 做还剩余有时间的情况下我必须要做的事
- What are you doing? - What has to be done while the time is remaining.

639
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,279
你要刑讯逼供吗?
You're gonna torture me?

640
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,759
- 帮帮我! 求你们了! - 小棕 你要干什么啊?
- Do something! Please! - Brown, what are you doing?

641
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,119
- 我很清楚我在干什么 - 你是说你以前也这样干过?
- I know what I'm doing. - You mean what, you've done this before?

642
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,999
- 是 以前在军队服役时干过 - 我还以为你是个职业赌徒呢
- In the services, yeah. - I thought you were a gambler.

643
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,279
军人都是赌徒
All soldiers are gamblers.

644
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,279
瞧 我知道大腿内侧的肉肉特别地敏感
See, I find the flesh of the inner thigh especially sensitive.

645
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,039
- 混蛋! 别碰我! - 住手吧! 应该还有其它办法让她交待的!
- Fuck you! Get off me! - Stop this! This can't be our only option!

646
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,959
是 是有其它办法 但我喜欢用这办法
No, it isn't, it's mine.

647
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,599
看看这是什么啊?
What have we here?

648
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,919
看样子在我之前已经有人收拾过你了
It seems you got there before me.

649
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,279
怎么? 是因为在工作中还是在家里表现不好?
What, undervalued at work and at home?

650
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,839
你老爸不喜欢你?
Daddy didn't love you, hm?

651
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,039
我这是用你所心理学知识分析出来的 我分析的对不对啊?
Through your studied psychology to find out why, Tell me I'm wrong.

652
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,199
不 其实在我进一步考虑后 别回答我前面的问题 回答这个提问...
No, actually on second thoughts, don't answer that. Answer this...

653
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,559
- 问题是什么? - 我不知道!
- What is the question? - I don't know!

654
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,799
- 你在说谎! - 我不知道 我发誓!
- You're lying! - I don't know, I swear!

655
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,439
问题是什么?
What is the question?

656
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,599
这项测试的目的是什么?
What is the purpose of this exam?

657
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,548
你觉得如果我知道通过测试的方法是要对我刑讯逼供才能找出来
Do you think I volunteered if the only way for you to solve this was to

658
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:48,799
我还会自愿参加这个测试吗?
beat it out of me?

659
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,959
你这个爱找麻烦的家伙!
How fucked up are you!

660
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,959
只有20分钟了 这才是最麻烦的
With 20 minutes left, this fucked up.

661
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,919
好了 够了!
OK, enough!

662
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,079
别来插手
Don't interfere.

663
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,919
看在上帝的份上 她只是个女流之辈啊
For God's sake. This is a woman.

664
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,719
男女平等 小黑
Equal opportunities, Black.

665
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,919
你们人力资源部派你来时早就知道会这样 对吧?
HR wouldn't expect anything less, would they?

666
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,359
哦 对啊想办法让保安来帮你啊
Oh, by all means, ask him for help.

667
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,079
瞧 这不是针对你个人的
Look, it's nothing personal.

668
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,639
我们只是想知道你所了解的情况而已
We just need to know what you know.

669
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,799
小棕 别这么干! 肯定有其它办法去了解情况的!
Brown, don't do this! There must be another way!

670
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,919
我们需要的是确定无疑的结果
We need certainty.

671
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,519
而这样的结果只有通过施加难以忍受的痛苦得到...
The kind only unbearable pain can give...

672
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,879
我已经告诉了你我所知道的一切事!
I've told you everything I know!

673
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,599
求你了 住手吧!
Please stop!

674
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,439
...只有通过威胁才能得到答案
...or the threat of it.

675
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,039
她说的是实话
She's telling the truth.

676
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,519
不好意思
Sorry.

677
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,839
拿去
Here.

678
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,559
谢谢
Thank you.

679
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,959
你不是想看他抽筋吗 现在他开始抽搐了
You wanted convulsions, now you've got them.

680
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,999
你觉得他是装出来的?
You think he's faking it?

681
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,759
是真的抽了
It's genuine.

682
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,879
- 你怎么知道? - 我妻子就是得这病死的
- How do you know? - My wife, she died from it.

683
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,439
我也中了这种病毒 他没装
I'm a carrier. He's not faking.

684
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,879
就算是骗子有时也会说真话
Even liars tell the truth occasionally.

685
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,479
- 他得吃药 是吧? - 得尽快给他吃
- He really needs that pill, doesn't he? - Fast.

686
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,559
如果有谁拿了他的药 现在快点承认吧
If anyone took it, own up now.

687
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,839
好吧 如果我们相互都信不过的话 那只能相互搜身了
Alright, if we can't trust each other, we'll have to search each other.

688
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,159
没有
Nothing.

689
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,599
- 还有口香糖吗? - 不好意思 吃完了
- Got any gum? - Sorry. I'm all out.

690
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,199
真的?
Really?

691
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,679
军人都是赌徒
All soldiers are gamblers,

692
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,399
而赌徒又都是作弊者 我找到了
and all gamblers are cheats, I've found.

693
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,599
是通过你所说的格言找到的
Given the opportunity.

694
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,639
- 我算到了你可能会找到的 - 你和小白一样坏
- I took a calculated risk. - You're as bad as he is.

695
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,839
不 他比小白更坏 小白至少不会伪装自己
No, he's worse. There was never any pretence about White.

696
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,559
- 让我们从自身利益角度出发再好好想想吧 - 他就要死了 还要想?
- Let's think about it selfishly again. - While he's dying?

697
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,599
这可不是一己之利的事 这是谋杀!
That's not selfishness, that's murder!

698
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,199
死亡之前会昏迷的 对吧?昏迷时再吃药 也能恢复过来的
Coma comes before death, right?People recover from comas.

699
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,879
他这种状况不行的 他的状况太严重了 不可能恢复过来的
Not this kind. Sink too deep and it's irreversible.

700
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,079
而这个药里的成份能象肾上腺素一样重新激活他的心脏
But that pill mimics an adrenaline shot to the heart.

701
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,525
如果想救他的话 就得马上给他吃药
If you're gonna do it, do it now.

702
01:07:57,526 --> 01:07:59,239
你忘了你是怎么说他的了吗?
Have you forgotten what you said about him?

703
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,799
我们又不是要放开他 只是救他的命 让她给他喂药!
We're not releasing him, we're saving his life, now let her go!

704
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,039
我恐怕不能让你这样做!
I'm afraid I can't do that!

705
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,759
能看见 就是够不着!
I can see it, but I can't reach!

706
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,079
我来试试
Let me try.

707
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,959
显然神灵们也同意我的观点
Obviously the Gods agree with my risky assessment.

708
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,039
他不省人事了吗?
Is he unconscious?

709
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,519
他快不行了!
He's lapsing!

710
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,639
咱们得把他带出去进行治疗
We have to carry him out for treatment.

711
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,839
Biorg公司会理解我们的做法的 相信我
Biorg will understand. Trust me.

712
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,599
你到底帮不帮我?
Are you gonna help me?

713
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,999
好 你们可以毫无良心地看着他死 我不行
Fine, you can live with his death on your consciences. I can't.

714
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,319
他在出血! 这是怎么回事?
He's bleeding! What does that mean?

715
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,039
不知道 我以前没见过这种情况 不过这绝对不是好事
I don't know, I haven't seen this before. But it can't be good.

716
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,559
- 救救他啊 小黑! - 怎么救? 我又不是医生!
- Do something, Black! - Like what? I'm not a doctor!

717
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,319
请救救他啊!
Help him, please!

718
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,079
你们没看到他快死了吗?
Can't you see he's dying?

719
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,639
不! 我是这的员工! 我在这公司里工作的!
No! I work for you! I work here!

720
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,039
这药还真象你说的那样起作用啊
You weren't wrong about that pill.

721
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,879
嘿...
Hey...

722
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,439
- 如果你能听到我说的话 点下你的... - 一群混蛋
- If you can hear me, nod your... - Fuckers.

723
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,399
我也感染了这种病毒 兄弟
I have it too, brother.

724
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,199
是嘛 别指望我感谢你
Yeah, well, don't expect me to thank you.

725
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,999
你得感谢她...
You have her to thank...

726
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,599
而不是谢我
.. not me.

727
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,679
嗯 真希望她给我做人工呼吸来救我而不是给我吃药
Well, I would've preferred the kiss of life.

728
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,199
我敢说你做人工呼吸肯定很在行 对吧?
I bet you're good at that, aren't you?

729
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,719
噢
Wow.

730
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,359
留下了4个淘汰了4个
Four down and four to go.

731
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,119
只剩10分钟了
And only 10 minutes on the clock.

732
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,639
真是激动人心的测试啊!
It's exciting!

733
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,799
我刚才感觉到你从我身上拿药了 知道吧
I felt you take it, you know,

734
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,399
这房子无法同时容纳咱们2个人
It's a room not big enough for both of us,

735
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,439
要的就是你这股狠劲 小棕
That's the spirit, Brown.

736
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,079
如果你能记得我拿走你的药
If you remember me taking it,

737
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,159
那你也应该能记得你给我们的许诺
you'll remember the promise you made us.

738
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,399
金发女把药给你吃了
Blonde gave you the pill as requested.

739
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,559
现在你应该兑现你的承诺了
Now give us what we asked for in return.

740
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,799
- 你说的是问题吧? - 问题是什么?
- The question? - What is it?

741
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,279
问题藏在哪?
Where is it?

742
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,479
你还是没明白 是吧?
You still don't get it, do you?

743
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,879
那还是让我来给你说清楚吧
Let me spell this out for you.

744
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,399
根本就没有问题!
There is no question!

745
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,599
明白了吧?
Alright?

746
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,919
从一开始就没有问题!
There never was one!

747
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,879
哼 反正没有你们所想找的那种问题
Well, not the kind you're looking for anyway.

748
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,039
这就是你不想说出来的信息?
That's what you've been holding back?

749
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,839
- 这就是你的小秘密? - 是哦
- That's your big secret? - Uh-huh.

750
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,799
你知道监考人说了什么
You heard the lnvigilator.

751
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,359
只有一个问题向你们提出 你们只需回答出一个答案
There's one question before you, and one answer is required.

752
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,679
只有一个问题! 你的意思是监考人说的是谎话?
There is one question! You're calling him a liar?

753
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,715
当你排除掉所有的不可能因素后
When you've eliminated the impossible,

754
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:04,399
剩下的肯定就是真象了 对吧?
whatever's left has to be the truth, don't they?

755
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,559
不管结果多么不可信 但它就是真象
No matter how crazy it seems.

756
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,719
这项测试就是所谓的问题!
This test is the question!

757
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,399
而我们就是答案
And the answer is us.

758
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,559
- 我们都是答案 - 答案 复数?
- We're the answers. - Answers, plural?

759
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,639
- 如果我没记错的话... - 你们只需回答出一个答案
- If I recall... - One answer is required.

760
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,999
- 答案应该是单数的 - 对啊
- Singular. - That's right.

761
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,759
我们中只能有一个成为答案
Just one of us.

762
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,999
你敢!
You wouldn't dare.

763
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,959
哇哦! 哇哦!
Whoa! Whoa!

764
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,079
- 哇哦! 大家都冷静点 好吧? - 同意!
- Whoa! Everybody calm down, yeah? - Seconded.

765
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,639
好吧 好吧 好吧
Alright, alright, alright.

766
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,879
- 你不会向我开枪的 - 我抢枪不是为了射你的!
- You're not gonna shoot me. - I didn't take it to shoot you!

767
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,479
我是为了阻止你抢到枪向我们开火!
I took it to stop you from using it on us!

768
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,039
让我告诉你我是怎么想的
Let me tell you what I think.

769
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,479
我也认为我们就是答案 不过是我们一起 做为一个团队一起成为答案!
I think we're the answers too. All of us together, as a team!

770
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,839
我走进这房间是还觉得我们大家都会通过这个测试的
I think we'd all passed when we walked in here.

771
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,719
而我们的所作所为却让我们失去了本来得到的东西
All each of us can do today is lose what we've already won

772
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,359
这都是因为大家的私心重 愚蠢和急功近利!
through selfishness, stupidity and impatience!

773
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,839
聋子说的对
Deaf was right.

774
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,999
在这我们只看我们想看到的东西
We see what we want to see in here.

775
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,399
你是个好斗的人 所以你所想的就是
You're a fighter so you all can think about

776
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,159
成为我们中唯一的胜出者
is being the last man standing,

777
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,839
但是他们根本就没说过只招聘一个人
but they never said there was only one position available.

778
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,159
好 我只看我想看到的 小黑
Yeah, I see what I want to see, Black.

779
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,119
而你只听你想听的话 对了吧?
And you hear what you want to hear, alright?

780
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,479
但你回答下我的问题 兄弟!
But answer me this, brother!

781
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,519
什么样的公司会不清楚自己有多少空缺职位?
What corporation doesn't know how many positions it's got available?

782
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,839
什么样的CEO居然决定不了自己要1个还是8个助理?
What CEO can't decide whether he wants one assistant or eight?

783
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,879
CEO办公室只有一个空缺职位 你知道的
There's only one job going in his office, you know that,

784
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,999
你说的那些只是你的想象而已
And the rest is fantasy.

785
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,039
小白 别靠上来!
White, stay back!

786
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,359
为了这份工作杀人不值啊
This ain't worth killing for.

787
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,039
你好象不是这样想啊 是吧?
You seem to think it is, is it?

788
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,879
- 为了这份工作值得你去死吗? - 把枪放下 小黑
- Worth dying for? - Put the gun down, Black.

789
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,599
是你先想去抢枪的 现在我是箭在弦上不得不发了!
You started this, now it's in play!

790
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,479
- 我们不可能再把枪放回保安的枪套里了 - 那就把它扔出门去吧
- We can't put it back to the holster. - Throw it out the door then.

791
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,519
这样做也不会违反规则啊
That won't break any rules.

792
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,239
来吧 射我啊
Go on, shoot me.

793
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,079
来啊 爆我头 来啊
Go on, shoot me in the head, go on.

794
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,759
- 看 你就不是个杀人的料 对吧? - 别再靠近了!
- See? You can't fight who you are, can you? - Don't!

795
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,999
指纹验证系统啊
Fingerprint ID.

796
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,119
不要啊!
No!

797
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,039
好的
OK.

798
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,999
好吧 好吧
OK, OK.

799
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,959
告诉我们你要怎么样
Just tell us what you want.

800
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,679
我想要单独胜出!
I want to be alone!

801
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,879
你想让我们把我们的纸都毁掉?
You want us to spoil our papers?

802
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,479
自行丧失竞争资格?
Disqualify ourselves?

803
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,839
好吧
OK.

804
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,039
我们俯首称臣就是了
We'll take those odds over the alternative.

805
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,039
你胜出了
You win.

806
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,999
我没办法让我的这个同伙护送你出去了 他得要用手帮我呢
I can't let my partner escort you out, we just became friends.

807
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,239
你自己走出这个房间怎么样?
How about you walk out instead?

808
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,319
你们都出去 一个一个来
Each of you. One by one.

809
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,719
从你开始
Starting with you.

810
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,759
快啊 我们时间不多 走吧!
Come on, we ain't got all a day! Let's go.

811
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,799
这个破公司很配你个烂人
They deserve you.

812
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,719
该你了
Now you.

813
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,639
快点
Come on.

814
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,359
- 别犯傻了 小黑 - 你不会开枪的
- Don't be stupid, Black. - You won't shoot.

815
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,999
我不会中弹的
I'll be missed.

816
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,599
你和我一样都得了那种病
You're sick like me.

817
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,719
你死在这的话 他们会有合理的解释来掩盖真象的 明白?
Your death will be explained away, OK?

818
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,239
房间外面的人不会关心真象的
No one outside this room even cares.

819
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,777
他们自己还有事要操心呢
They've got problems of their own,

820
01:18:57,778 --> 01:18:59,759
比如避免被病毒感染
like avoiding the infection themselves.

821
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,879
你的良心会不安的
Your conscience will haunt you.

822
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,959
如果我有良心的话才会不安嘛
You're assuming I've got one.

823
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,999
我走 我弃权
I'll go. I'm through with this.

824
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,279
准备好了吗?
Ready?

825
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,439
别哭 亲爱的
Don't cry, darlin'.

826
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,119
反正你也不过只是这的一个过客而已
You were a passenger in here, anyway.

827
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,039
- 你自己把事搞砸了的 - 我还救了你的命呢
- You fucked your way to the top. - Then I saved your life.

828
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,119
哼 人人都会犯错的 我恩将仇报也只是犯了个小错而已
Well, anyone can make a mistake.

829
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,599
关灯!
Lights out!

830
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,879
开灯!
Lights on!

831
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,639
必须继续清楚的看下去
Toujours y voir clairement est primordial.

832
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,799
去看明显是最关键的步骤
To see clearly is all.

833
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,999
噢?
Well?

834
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,519
你说会有一个胜出者的 这个胜出者就站在你面前!
You said there's one answer and you're looking at him!

835
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,359
我做了能做的一切! 我制造这儿发生的所有事端
I've done everything! I made everything happen in here,

836
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,519
而她什么都没做!
and she's done nothing!

837
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,199
我是胜出者! 我才是你想要的人!
It's me! I'm the one you want!

838
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,559
我是你想要的人!
I'm the one you want!

839
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,959
如果你试图与我本人或保安沟通...
If you try to communicate with myself or the guard...

840
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,959
...你将丧失竞争资格
...you will be disqualified.

841
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,439
我就知道 事情有眉目了你就现身了
That's it, join in at last.

842
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,239
你是聋子又不是哑巴 嗯?
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

843
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,599
只有一个问题向你们提出 你们只需回答出一个答案
There is one question before you, and one answer is required.

844
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,399
准备好了吗?
Ready?

845
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,959
- 答案? - 这就是你不想说出来的信息?
- Answers? - That's what you've been holding back?

846
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,679
- 这就是你的小秘密? - 你还是没搞明白 是吧?
- That's your big secret? - You still don't get it, do you?

847
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,799
问题是什么? 它藏在哪?
What is it? Where is it?

848
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,559
- 你是说问题是什么吗? - 这项测试的目的是什么?
- The question? - What's the purpose of this exam?

849
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:44,039
- 问题到底是什么? 告诉我们啊! - 和你有什么关系?
- The question? What is it? Then, tell us! - What does it matter?

850
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,039
你觉得他在监视我们?
You really think he's behind there?

851
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,919
他长年累月就待在办公室里
He's lived behind walls for years.

852
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,159
你怎么知道这些情况的?
How do you know all this?

853
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,079
你什么意思? 难道是他们专门做了个局让我们几个聚在一起?
Are you saying? That they rigged the test to bring us all together?

854
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,479
你有什么事想告诉我们吗?
Is there something you want to tell us?

855
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,479
- 这只是张纸而已 - 哦 这可不只是张纸 对吧?
- It's a piece of paper. - Well, It's more than that, though, isn't it?

856
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,199
如果我们根本就无法看到它 怎么能把它找出来?
If we can't see it, how are we supposed to find it?

857
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,959
会不会问题已经写出来了? 只是我们看不到而已?
What if the question is written down? We just can't see it?

858
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,479
会不会这也能让问题显现出来呢?
What if it reveals the question too?

859
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,959
他们不会搞的这么简单就让我们得手的 对吧?
They're not gonna make it that easy, are they?

860
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,639
那他们能搞的有多难?
How hard can they afford to make it?

861
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,719
有没有人已经想出答案了?
So has anyone figured out the answer yet?

862
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,759
答案不重要 重要的是问题
It's not about the answer, it's about the question.

863
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,079
问题是什么啊?
What is the question?

864
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,719
问题是什么?
What is the question?

865
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,319
有疑问吗?
Any questions?

866
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,279
没有疑问
No.

867
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:14,359
这就是你向我们提问的那个问题的答案
That's the answer you wanted to the first question asked of us.

868
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,879
那也是我唯一的提问
The only question asked of you.

869
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,399
- 我也几乎错过了答案 - 几乎?
- I almost missed it too. - Almost?

870
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,399
实际上 我们很高兴今天招到了人
As it is, we're happy to be hiring someone today.

871
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,359
我还没决定来不来这个公司呢
I haven't accepted yet.

872
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,679
如果你不想要这份工作的话 你刚开始就不会应聘了
You wouldn't have participated if you didn't want the job.

873
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,279
那是没有发生这些事之前
That was before. Before all this.

874
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,279
现在测试结束了 我也要提问
Now it's over, I have questions.

875
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,839
- 提问? - 是 不止提一个
- Questions? - More than one.

876
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,639
问吧
Ask.

877
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,679
你看起来不像这个公司的CEO啊
You don't look like him.

878
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:03,839
任何体面的人都能在股东和媒体面前冒充CEO
Any suit can play the CEO for shareholders and the media.

879
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,239
而我们公司的创始人不是个商人
Our founder isn't a businessman.

880
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,879
- 他对虚名不感兴趣 - 太可惜了
- He has no interest in fame. - That's too bad.

881
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:15,559
- 他刚才的演技都可以得奖了 - 谁说他那是演出来的?
- That was some performance. - Who said it was a performance?

882
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,439
我们公司的创始人是个科学家 革新者
Our founder is a scientist, an innovator.

883
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,479
他对要来公司与他共事的人的要求是很高的
He's very particular about those he invites to work with him,

884
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:29,439
特别是这次的招聘决定是他做过的最重要的招聘决定
especially when it comes to the most important hiring decision he's ever made.

885
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,759
重要到可以为此杀人?
Important enough to kill for?

886
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,839
你怎么会觉得他死了呢?
What makes you think he's dead?

887
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,559
在研发针对那种病的特效药时
While searching for the cure,

888
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,239
我们意外地发现了某种超强的东西
we stumbled upon something far more powerful.

889
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,679
急速细胞再生...
Rapid cell regeneration...

890
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,199
...通过口服药来实现
...in a pill.

891
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:52,519
这种药能根除那种病毒 并能治愈其它难以治疗的基因疾病
It eradicates the virus and other stubborn mutations.

892
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:57,479
- 这是有魔力的子弹啊 - 这能拯救成千上万人的生命
- The magic bullet. - The gift of life for millions.

893
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,679
不过这也带来了意想不到的两难局面
