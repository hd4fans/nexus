1
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,907
自天地初开之时
[Man Narrating] Since time began...

2
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,977
世界就被一场在
a war has been waged in the shadows...

3
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,206
正义和邪恶之间的战争所笼罩着
between the armies ofGood and Evil.

4
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:23,683
这场战争可能惊天地泣鬼魂
It may be fought on a grand scale...

5
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:26,805
也可能只是在小孩之间的心魔之战
or within the heart ofa single individual-or even a child.

6
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,982


7
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,450
邪恶力量无处不在
The Evil has taken many forms...

8
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,430
它被黑暗所支配着
and used the darkest ofarts.

9
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,024
在现代，他们被称作
In our time, they call themselves simply...

10
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:43,036
幻影杀手
the Hand.

11
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:46,767
正义总是站在善良的一方
The Good follow the way ofki magure.

12
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,105
仁慈之主不但可以看到未来
Its masters can see the future...

13
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:53,340
甚至能够起死回生
and perhaps even bring back the dead.

14
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:56,351
这是个武魂的传奇故事
Legend tells of a unique warrior...

15
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,581
她是一颗失落的灵魂
a lost soul.

16
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,019
她是个女战士
This warrior is a woman...

17
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,023
她是个孤儿
a motherless daughter.

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:08,529
上天安排她去平息这场 正义与邪恶之战
And it is her destiny to tip the balance between Good and Evil.

19
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,623
有个小孩是力量之源 双方都需要她的协助
She is a treasure, and both sides seek her out...

20
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:16,226
她将成为战争中的终极武器
as a final weapon in an ancient war.

21
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:27,150
片名：艾丽卡 又名：幻影杀手

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,482
- 你那有什么动静吗？ - 一切正常
- [ Man ] Perimeter, what's your status? - [ Man #2 ] Delta team, clear.

23
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,383
- 一切正常 - 一切正常
- [ Man #3 ] Alpha, clear. - [ Man #4 ] Bravo, secure.

24
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,786
没有用的
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,292
你阻止不了她的
You can't stop her.

26
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:43,387
- 没人能阻止她 - 就凭她？
- Nobody can stop her. - Her?

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,863
恐怕这次你无法完成任务
I was afraid if I told you, you wouldn't take the job.

28
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,870
我本来是不想请你出山的
I never should've hired you.

29
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,313
冲你来的那个人到底是谁？
Who doyou think's coming foryou?

30
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:02,042
你也许听说过她，她叫…
You may have heard ofher. Her name...

31
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,485
艾丽卡
is Elektra.

32
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,020
- 你觉得这个很好笑吗？ - 她是城里一段传奇
- You find that funny? - She's an urban legend, sir.

33
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,060
几年前就死了
That woman died years ago.

34
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:17,962
真的？ 那应该派人把她的尸体带回来
Really? Well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.

35
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,263
鲍尔，知道吗？ 我们的所作所为
You know, Bauer, whenyou've done the things I've done...

36
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,735
给我们树立了好多敌人
you make a lot of enemies.

37
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:28,867
我花巨款买来的密报说
My private security detail- the best money could buy.

38
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,413
这个死掉的女人 在半个小时内杀了14个人
This nonexistent woman killed 1 4 of them in half an hour.

39
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,415
我都不敢离开这里
I barelygot away.

40
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:40,545
奇怪的是，在蒙特卡洛时 她居然放过我
Spent the next two days in Monte Carlo wondering why she let me go.

41
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,850
而现在却又向我杀来
Then she came for me.

42
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:47,122
原本是幻影杀手负责我的安全 而她曾经是他们的一分子
I was underthe protection ofthe Hand itself, who sent theirbest.

43
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,790
现在组织为了杀她 已经不管我得死活
Although theyseemed more interested in killing Elektra than in protecting me.

44
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,133
把这些保镖碾个粉碎
She cut 'em down I i ke wheat.

45
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,133
她只需要10分钟，最多15分钟
T ook maybe 1 0, 1 5 m i nutes max.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,075
我不能再袖手旁观
Didn't really think why I kept gettin' away.

47
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,577
这是我来的目的
So here I am.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,580
我现在了解她了
And now I understand her.

49
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,451
她想让我尝尝这种滋味
She wanted me to feel this...

50
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,750
像是走头无路
what it's like to have nowhere to go...

51
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,915
无人求援
nowhere to turn.

52
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,693
你现在感觉怎么样？
How's yourperimeter doing now?

53
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,101
德尔塔，你那里情况怎么样？
Delta, what's your status?

54
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,401
没有反应 臭婊子
There's no signal. Son of a bitch.

55
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,773
- 你知道吗，这种刺客喜欢 - 阿尔法，布莱欧，请回答
- You know, the better the assassin- -Alpha, Bravo, report!

56
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,869
在你知道她的行踪之前 她会先慢慢逼近，然后干掉你
the closer they can get to you before you know they're there.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,608
阿尔法，布莱欧，请回答
Alpha! Bravo! Report!

58
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,877
该死
- [ Static ] - Ah, Christ.

59
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,784
他们说在艾丽卡杀你之前 会在你耳边说悄悄话
They say Elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you.

60
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:53,224
- 阿尔法，布莱欧，请回答 - 老板现在太晚了，鲍尔
- Alpha! Bravo! Report! - [ Woman ] It's too late foryour boss, Bauer.

61
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,228
- 但你还是有机会的 - 哦，该死
- But you still have a chance. -Jesus Christ!

62
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,030
你无法与鬼魂战斗
[Woman ] You can't fight a ghost, Bauer.

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,232
该到我们了
- Here we are at last. - [ Exhales ]

64
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,406
跟传说的一模一样
Guess it's all true.

65
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,908
红色的衣服 还有那把刀
The red outfit and the knives and-

66
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,312
现在你想怎么样？
So, what happens now?

67
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:22,076
毫不犹豫地杀了我？
You just kill me, straight out? Just cold?

68
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:25,243
不要怕 死亡并不是一件很可怕的事
Don't worry. Death's not that bad.

69
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,548
是吗？你怎么知道？
Yeah? How do you know?

70
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,796
我已经死过一次
[ Whispering ] I died once.

71
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,932
是什么感觉？ 有没有...
What's it like? Is there...

72
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:44,630
白光和上帝？
you know, a white light and God?

73
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:49,701
我想 我就要知道了
What- I guess I'll find out.

74
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,377
我也明白幻影杀手的力量
So am I to understand that with all the power ofthe Hand...

75
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,207
我们的头号杀手 还在躲避着我们？
that the Treasure continues to elude us?

76
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:28,749
对，我们本应该更早点采取行动
Yes. Perhaps ifwe had pursued it sooner...

77
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,750
向她发动更大的攻势
and more aggressively-

78
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,480
你胆敢怪罪帮主罗侍郎？
You dare to blame Master Roshi?

79
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:36,216
也许克阮你太掉以轻心了
Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi.

80
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,224
根本没有
Not at all, sensei.

81
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,487
如果我们不能得到这个力量之源
But ifwe cannot have the weapon ourselves...

82
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:45,089
也不能让她落入敌人的手里
allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands ofthose who may use it against us.

83
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,258
帮主，请让我插几句
Master, allow me.

84
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,929
这个事情一定要尽快地 悄悄地解决
Things like this must be handled smoothly, quietly.

85
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,236
那就悄悄地去办吧，马之密 但一定要快
Then work smoothly, Meizumi, but quickly.

86
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:08,347
克阮
Kirigi?

87
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,016
什么事？爸爸
Yes, Father.

88
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,093
耐心点
Patience.

89
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,731
你怎么门都不锁 一点安全意识都没有
[Man ] You think that's safe, leaving the door unlocked like that?

90
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,064
艾丽卡，一颗子弹就能结束你
Geez, Elektra, you're gonna end up with a bullet in your head.

91
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,571
我给你带了点东西
I brought you a little something.

92
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:36,235
等下，不要放在那里 我刚刚擦好
No, stop, McCabe. Don't put it down. I al ready cleaned there.

93
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,711
- 为什么你整天的清洗这里？ - 擦除我的DNA
- Why do you always do this? - Get rid of my D.N.A.

94
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:45,183
啊，DNA，说得没错
Ah, D.N.A., of course. Right.

95
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:48,744
我真傻，这个是我刚拿到的 你一定想看看
Silly of me. Listen, I just picked this up. I knowyou like to look.

96
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,619
- 全部在里面了？ - 连我的一成也没到
- It's all there? - Less my 1 0%.

97
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,862
- 到巴巴多斯岛拿一半 - 还有一半要到马恩岛拿
- Halfto Barbados? - And halfto the bank on the Isle of Man.

98
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,462
其实你可以赚更多 我知道一个人，我帮你联系他
You can do better in mutual funds. I know a guy. I could putyou in touch-

99
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:09,407
- 不用了，谢谢 - 不要了？但是...
- No, thanks. - Or not. But-

100
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,941
听我说，其实我不想干涉你的事情
Look, I don't want to tell you how to doyour thing...

101
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,212
但是这一次 有很多人抢这个生意
but quite a body count on this one, E.

102
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,348
难道我们只能为丹马克卖命
We were only getting paid for DeMarco.

103
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,928
非得这样吗？
Was it necessary?

104
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,498
是不得不
Had to be done.

105
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,831
是吗？
Did it?

106
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,632
艾丽卡
Elektra.

107
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,866
是吗？
Did it?

108
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,715
好吧
Okay.

109
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,510
我们要紧尊师父的教诲
Anyway, it spreads the legend.

110
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,450
否则，我会死的
Besides, theywere gonna kill me.

111
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,954
这个说的没错
Of course they were. Absolutely.

112
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,321
但是听你的特工小组说
And, speaking ofwhich, as your agent...

113
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:01,725
这是一件及其重要的任务
I am obligated to tell you we just got an absolutely fantastic new offer...

114
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,992
- 也是你最后的任务 - 我们不要谈这个了，我需要休息一下
- but that last job- - Let's skip this one. I need a breather.

115
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,500
- 那好吧，我只是说这次报酬很高 - 我已经很累了
- Great idea. I'm just sayin' it's a lot of coin. - I'm tired.

116
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,037
你真的累了？ 那你还真需要好好睡一觉
You're tired? Well, then you better getyourselfsome sleep...

117
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,232
否则你很快会垮掉的
'causeyou are gonna crash, baby, you know that.

118
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,366
你好像从来都没有休息过的样子
I mean, you even get laid?

119
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,646
这次任务报酬真的很多
It's a lot of money, this new offer.

120
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,879
- 曼柯 - 好，好吧
- McCabe. - All right, fine. You know what?

121
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:30,924
那你慢慢休息一下 你想行动的时候打电话给我
Look, you want to take time off, take time off. Call me when you wanna work.

122
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,984
多少钱？说吧
How much? And just tell me.

123
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:37,223
两百万
Two.

124
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,697
他们也可能雇其他杀手
Ah, they'll give it to somebody else.

125
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,429
他们不会付给别人这么多的
Theywouldn't pay that to somebody else.

126
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,437
你说得对
You got that right.

127
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,575
他们很想你去处理这件事
They asked specifically foryou.

128
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,478
地点在那里面 找到目标以后通知你
Location's in there. I'll call you when I get the target.

129
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:58,552
好好睡会吧
Get some sleep.

130
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,565
再试一次
- Again! - [ Man ] Clear!

131
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,533
你知道你的方向吗，艾丽卡
[Man's Voice ] Doyou knowthe way, Elektra?

132
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,744
意念，可以让你控制时间
[Man's Voice Continuing] Kimagure, the abilityto control time...

133
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,079
看到未来
the future...

134
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,414
甚至可以起死回生
even life and death.

135
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,613
我知道我是这里最好的学生
[ Elektra ] I know I'm the best student here.

136
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,625
不是最好的 但是最有力量的
Not the best. The most powerful.

137
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,626
你明白暴力和痛苦
You understand violence and pain.

138
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,805
但你还没有领悟到突破的出路
But you do not know the way.

139
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,408
- 那请你教我吧 - 这个我办不到
- Teach me then. - That's my point.

140
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,409
这个不是教出来的
I can't teach you.

141
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,943
我要你离开这里
I want you to go.

142
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,949
这个算是测验吗？师傅
Is this a test, sensei?

143
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,020
不是测验
No, not a test.

144
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,891
走吧
Just go.

145
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,394
我没有地方去
I don't have anywhere to go.

146
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,331
委托人说要你 早几天到行动地点
[McCabe ] The clientsays he needsyou there a couple days early...

147
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,336

Hey, me too. Listen, why don't you tell me about the view?

151

Let's go! Let's push, push, push, push!

继续，艾丽卡
[Nikolas ] Keep going, Elektra.

158
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,201
继续踩
Keep going.

159
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:27,475
天哪，你疯了 你差点杀了我
Jesus! What's the matter with you? You could have killed me!

160
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,481
你在这里干吗？
What are you doing here?

161
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,450
没什么 我只是在这里随便走走
Nothing. I'm friends with the Wheelwrights.

162
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,852
真实糟糕 你把我的大衣弄坏了
[ Sighs ] Damn it. You cut my friggin' jacket.

163
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,227
- 你怎么进去的？ - 门根本就没有锁
- How did you get in? - The front doorwas unlocked.

164
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:45,196
- 不可能 - 它是没有锁
- No, it wasn't. - Yeah, it was.

165
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,030
住在这里的人都让我随便出入 不信你去问
[ Sighs ] Look, the people who live here let me come in all the time. Ask anybody.

166
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,603
好像是坏了
Hmm. It's broken.

167
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:58,902
- 你是？我的名字是艾比 - 你偷了什么东西
- So, who areyou anyways? My name's Abby. - What'd you steal?

168
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,743
什么都没有 你把我当成什么？
[ Sighs ] Nothing. What doyou think I am?

169
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,150
求你不要叫警察

00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:44,066
哦，妈的
Oh, shit.

178
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,757
我坐不住了，曼柯 快点告诉我目标
[Elektra ] You know I can't sit still, McCabe. Call me with the name.

Eddie Ferris, the Realtor- he said, uh, a young woman had taken it for the month.

187
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,277
关你什么事？
What do you want?

188
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,474
对不起，我也许不该说这个
Sorry. This is kind of awkward, but, uh...

189

193
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,656
真是气人
Shit. Really?

194
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,860
她总是到处乱跑
Uh, she knows the Wheelwrights, who, uh-

195
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:19,302
那她拿你什么东西没？
She, uh, didn't take anything, did she?

196
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:23,479
- 没有 - 那就好
- No. - Good.

197
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:27,549
如果她打坏你什么东西，我会赔给你 我叫马克・米勒
Look, if she broke something, I'm- I'm happy to pay for it. I'm Mark Miller.

00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,382

201
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,286
- 请不要留言 - 曼柯
- Do not leave a message. - [ Sighs ] McCabe...

202
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:52,456
我再坐在这里，就要发疯了
I 'm sick of sitting here.

203
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:55,431
如果你在弄不到对方的名字 我要离开这里了
We don't get a name soon, I'm walking.

204
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,082

你告诉他，我闯到你家去了吗？

- Yeah, becauseyou did break in. - Well, you didn't have to tell him.

210
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,171
我还以为你不会计较呢
I thoughtyou were cool.

211
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:28,434
- 可惜我不是 - 没错，一点都不会骗人
- I'm not. - Yeah, no kidding.

212
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:31,841
我爸让我来邀请你去 跟我们共进圣诞晚餐
Now he's on my case. He made me come askyou to have Christmas dinnerwith us.

218

你现在在一个孤岛上
You're on an island.

219
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,325
求你了，来吧

每天晚上都是我们两个
It's just the two of us every night...

221
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,835
我都厌倦这种生活了

你会来的是吧，求你了
So, will you come? Please?

226
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,652

Because ifyou don't, I'll just keep breaking intoyour house. Hmm?

227
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,830
那我要去换下衣服
Hmm. I have to change my clothes.

228
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,459
太好了
Great!

229
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,902
我叫艾比

230
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,034
艾丽卡
Elektra.

231
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,543
艾丽卡，不错
Elektra. Cool.

232
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,716
跟你讲了不要出去
I told you not to leave the house.

233
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,722
- 你根本就不知道我出去了 - 艾比
- You didn't even know I was gone. - Abby.

234
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,725
先暂停爸爸 我们有个客人

235
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,734
对不起 她说是你要她去邀请我的
I'm sorry. She told me that you'd invited me.

236
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,337
我本不想来
I don't want to-

237
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,671
- 我只是
- I'll just- - Hmm. Uh-uh.

238
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,506
没关系的，一起吃饭吧

你要喝点啤酒还是红酒？

水
Water.

242
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,155
她叫艾丽卡，爸爸
Her name's Elektra, Dad.

243
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:33,966
艾丽卡
- ** [ Continues ] - Elektra.

244
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:37,264
奇怪的名字 你父母一定很幽默吧
Like the tragedy. Your parents must have had a sense of humor.

245
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,534
一点都不
Not really.

246
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:49,270
爸爸，当她看我这个美男子 像是超越了她所有的朋友
[Abby] So when she sees all the cute guys who like me- just as friends, Dad-

247
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:53,410
她决定把我画在泰姬陵的墙上 作为他们的代表
she accidentally spills posterpaint all over my model ofthe Taj Mahal.

248
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,784
后来我在她的鼻子上涂了点胶水
So I put gl ue on her shoes.

249
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,653
结果她停止了计划画我的工程 后来由于打架我被赶出了那里
I got suspended for that, and then I got expelled for fighting.

250
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,785
这就是我在...
But that was way back in the day in- in, um...

251
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,591
巴尔的摩的童年生活
Baltimore.

252
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,464
我很好奇你为什么租了 惠尔莱特的房子
So, I was a little surprised to seeyou take the Wheelwright place.

253
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,799
因为很少有人 会在这个时候租他的房子的
Not manyrenters this time ofyear.

254
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,805
我是为工作，在这里住一个月
It's just for the month, forwork.

255
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,603
你是干什么的？
What do you do anyway?

256
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,230
专门做些解雇人 
Oh, layoffs, payroll reduction.

257
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,111
缩减工人薪水之类的事情
- That sort ofthing. - Hmm.

258
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,445
- 听上去很无聊的样子 - 艾比
- Sounds boring. - Abby.

259
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:27,987
没错，是很无聊 我很喜欢你的手镯
No, it is boring. I like your bracelet, by the way.

260
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,182
你知道它代表什么吗？
Do you know what those are? Here.

261
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,851
这是源于印尼水晶珠 它代表武士道精神
They're warrior beads. They're from Indonesia.

262
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,361
在古代，只有村庄 最好的武士才配戴它
Centuries ago, you had to be the best fighter in yourvillage to earn them.

263
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,695
我从网上买的
I bought 'em off eBay.

264
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,606
这岛上有学校吗？
Is there a school here on the island?

265
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,802
我们打算先进行一段家庭式的教育
Uh, we're tryinghomeschooling fora while.

266
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,675
我读过大学的书 自己也可以学代数
I read at college level. And I'm doing algebra one on my own.

267
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,338
她是个不错的学生
She's a goodstudent.

268
00:26:55,449 --> 00:27:00,284
但是他的行为却总是让我失望
It's the, uh, behavioral stuff that's been a problem.

269
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,719
我有权力干自己喜欢的事 我没有必要非听那些唠叨
I have authority issues, and I don't take bullshit well.

270
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:05,519
- 不要这样对你爸说 - 嗨，艾比
- Don't speak in that- - Hey, Abby!

271
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,763
没关系
It's okay.

272
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,135
这么快她已经是个大人了
Suddenly I got a teenager on my hands.

273
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,506
- 其实她很努力 - 你可以直接跟她说
- She's hard on herself. - You can tell, huh?

274
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,339
- 很多人认为她很懒 - 不，我不认为
- Most people think she's a slacker. - No, I shouldn't.

275
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,349
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas?

276
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,165
她妈妈呢？
Where's her mother?

277
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:51,007
她很多年前就死了
She died... a couple ofyears ago.

278
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:54,070
在巴尔的摩？
Back in Baltimore?

279
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,872
对，酒后驾车
Yeah. Drunk driver.

280
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,887
我很小的时候妈妈就死了
My mother died when I was young.

281
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,491
我应该回去了
I should go.

282
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,476
- 我还有工作要做 - 不是吧，天还早呢
- I have work. - Come on, it's early.

283
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,465
多谢晚餐
Thanks for dinner.

284
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,739

285

- It's a double. - Which makes double the money.

288
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:45,536
这正是赚这么多钱的原因
Yeah, that's why the big bucks.

289
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,753
- 怎么了？ - 没事

290

解决了我会打电话给你
I'll call you when it's done.

292
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,645
你的数学怎么样了？
How's math going?

293
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,424
你觉得呢？
How doyou think it's going?

294
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,034
什么，你居然没杀他们 是现在不行还是永远不行
What doyou mean, you're not doing it? Not now or not ever?

295
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,644
- 有太多因素了，背景比较复杂 - 背景？
- Too manyvariables. Not enough background. - Background?

296
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:29,081
好吧，那圣诞节到明尼苏打洲怎样？
Okay, well, how about, uh, born in Minnesota on Christmas Day.

297
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:32,345

Enjoys, uh, ice fishing and dragon movies.

他们会马上派别人来的
They'll just send somebody else, E.

300
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,765
我们所预测的暴风雨终于降临了
The storm we've been waiting- all- finally here.

301
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,771
- 暴风雨移到了西雅图的塔科马地区 - 我到仓库去拿沙袋
- It's moved into the Seattle-Tacoma area. - I'll getsandbags from the shed.

302
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:09,669
他们在说笑吧，说得这么激动 这只是一场雨而已
You know, this is such a joke. They make it sound all exciting, but you know it's just rain.

303
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:14,101
你如果不是很忙 就把窗户粘好
Ifyou're not too busy, young lady, feel free to tape the windows.

304
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:17,102
马上去

305
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,457
马克

我能跟你谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you?

307
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,063
我们能进屋说吗？

308
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,221
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

309
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:25,688
嗨，到底什么事？
Hey, what's up?

310
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:28,724
艾比，你能先去里面房间吗？ 我要跟你爸谈事情
Can you go to your bedroom for a minute, Abby? I need to talk to your dad.

311
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,814

00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,787
- 你到底是谁？跟我说实话 - 什么?

314
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,947
他们不仅要杀你
Theywon'tjust killyou.

315
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:46,614
还要杀了艾比
They'll kill Abby.

316
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:50,120
- 妈的 - 爸爸

317
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:52,051
快走
Go!

318
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,644
快跑艾比 到浴室去，快点跑
Run, Abby! Bathroom! Go! Go! Go!

319
00:35:56,923 --> 00:36:05,033
- 别离开艾比 - 好的
- Staywith Abby! - Okay.

320
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:24,749
艾比
[Mark ] Abby!

321
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:18,487
- 艾丽卡 - 艾比
- Elektra! - Abby!

322
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,273
谁派你来的？
[ Speaking Japanese ]

323
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,904
你很快就知道了

324
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,219
坏了
Damn it.

325
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,986
退后
Get back!

326
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:16,721
快点退后
Get back! Go!

327
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,626
走
[ Mark] Go.

328
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,403
他们马上就会到
There'll be more coming.

329
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,405
而且更厉害
What's coming next will be worse.

330
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:46,117
我想克阮对幻影理事会有话要说
I believe Kirigi wishes to address the Council ofthe Hand.

331
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,813
尊敬的主人
Venerable master...

332
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:52,084
尽管你是如此的精明能干
despite your delicacy and subtlety...

333
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:55,490
你却没能处理好能量之源
you have failed to solve the problem ofthe Treasure.

334
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:00,766
罗侍郎帮主已经把这个任务交给我
Master Roshi gave that task to me.

335
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,700
- 没错 - 我的手下会处理好的
- Yes, exactly. - And my men are taking care of it.

336
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,703
你的手下已经死了
Your men are dead!

337
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:07,932
是被那个杀手艾丽卡杀的
Killed bythe female, Elektra, the gaijin.

338
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,046
专横的人让人可恨
Your forces are an abomination!

339
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:06,498
罗侍郎帮主
Master Roshi...

340
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,000
幻影组织绝不能 失去这一代的能量之源
the Hand cannot afford to lose the Treasure for another generation.

341
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,935
所以我诚心的要求接受这个任务
So I humbly request you allow me this task.

342
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,132
也许我还是比较适合的
Perhaps with a little less delicacy...

343
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,142
至少我是不会输给一个女人
my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman.

344
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,303
这个任务就交给你了
The task is yours.

345
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:24,782
好好完成它 把你的领导能力证明给理事会
Complete it, andyou will have proven yourselfworthy ofleading this council.

346
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:29,345
我会置身事外
I will step aside.

347
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,576
幻影杀手的人
[ McCabe ] The Hand ofall people.

348
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,649
这次谁帮你摆平这件事情
So who's gonna help you out on this one, E?

349
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,650
- 斯迪克？ - 告诉我他的地址
- Stick? -J ust give me his location.

350
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:02,277
没问题 我有把握
Sure, no problem. I got it handled.

351
00:42:02,388 --> 00:42:04,288
该死的
Goddamn it.

352
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:23,942
轮到你了，盲人
[ Sighs ] You're up, blind man.

353
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,945
你双色，我要连进两球然后反弹再进三球 顺序是4 3 2 1 6
Double combo: triple carom on the four-three-two-one-six with a bank massé.

354
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:30,777
你不用把所有的都想象到这一枪上 这只是第一枪
Uh, you don't need to call all your shots, Pops.Just the first one.

355
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,783
没错就要这第一枪
That is the first one.

356
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,550
哇，你真会跟我开玩笑
Whoa, whoa. Aw, you gotta be kidding me.

357
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:52,268
8号球在角落里
Eight ball in the corner.

358
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,574
- 盲人？臭屁阿 - 把你的钱放在台桌上
- Blind, myass. - Leave your money on the table.

359
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:16,161
给你点钱去玩会弹球
Here's a dollar, Abs. Go play some pinball.

360
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:19,925
- 为什么总是赶我走 - 快去
- Why do I always have to miss the good stuff? -Just go.

361
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:28,563
艾丽卡，还是那样的走路方式
Elektra. Same walk.

362
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:30,835
那一种香水
Same perfume.

363
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,774
他们需要你的帮助
They need your help.

364
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,778
到这儿来
Over here.

365
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,280
这是马克・米勒
This is Mark Miller.

366
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,927
马克和他女儿被幻影杀手追杀
Mark and his daughter, Abby, are being chased by the Hand...

367
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:50,881
他们需要你的保护
andtheyneedyourprotection.

368
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,799
我把他们留在你这里 杀手你来应付，然后我就不管了
I'm leaving them with you. The Hand is your business, not mine.

369
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,735
对了，克阮 他们已经派克阮来了
Ah, Kirigi. They've sent Kirigi.

370
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:00,502
妈的
Shit.

371
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:03,100
你有没有问他们 杀手为什么要追杀他们？
Didyou everask whythe Hand was afterthem?

372
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:08,184
- 他们不知道 - 真的？米勒你不知道?
- They don't know. - Really? Mr. Miller doesn't know?

373
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,418
其实我知道
I do know.

374
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:17,543
幻影杀手想要的东西 他却不想给
The Hand wantedsomething he couldn't give.

375
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,429
他想逃跑
He tried to run.

376
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:22,764
然后呢？
And what?

377
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:25,222
他们杀了我妻子，艾比的妈妈
They killed my wife, Abby's mom.

378
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:27,950
她不是酒后驾车 是我撒谎了
There was no drunk driver. I lied.

379
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,567
你自己的事情自己解决吧
You're on your own.

380
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,576
你到底为什么要救他们，艾丽卡？
Why didyou reallysave them, Elektra?

381
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:37,821
难道是为了忏悔？ 为你所作所为赎罪？
Some kind of penance? A down payment on your sins?

382
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:41,458
她告诉你她实际是干什么的了 米勒先生？
Has she toldyou what she actually does for a living, Mr. Miller?

383
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:44,995
她救了我和我的女儿 这个已经足够了
She saved my life and my daughter's. That's enough for me.

384
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:47,589
而你想利用她对你的好感
Thenyou landed on the luckyside ofthe street.

385
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,520
该死你说什么
- Damn, you son of a bitch! - Because with most people-

386
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,153
艾丽卡
Well, Elektra...

387
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:08,183
你一点没变
you haven't changed.

388
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,638
我们去哪？
What are we gonna do?

389
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,965
艾丽卡？ 我们到底去哪？
Elektra? What are we gonna do?

390
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:25,566
你快点逃命吧 越远越好，越快越好
You gotta run. As far as you can, as fast as you can.

391
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,997
南美，非洲 改名换姓，改容换貌
SouthAmerica. Africa. Changeyourname. Changeyourappearance.

392
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,432
- 你不跟我们一块走？ - 不
- You're not coming with us? - No.

393
00:45:35,907 --> 00:45:40,144
- 我不能 - 为什么不？你难道没有什么藏身之处？
- I can't. - Why not? Isn't that part ofyour code or something?

394
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:42,239
我没有，艾比
I don't have a code, Abby.

395
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,592
- 那我们怎么保护自己？ - 我们没有事的，艾比
- How are we supposed to defend ourselves? - We'll be okay, Abby.

396
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:47,728
我们根本不行
No, we won't.

397
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:49,940
醒醒吧爸爸，我们力单物薄
Wake up, Dad. We won't!

398
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,109
他们要杀了我们 像对付妈妈那样
They're gonna hunt us down. Just like Mom.

399
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,325
快点进车
[ Breathing Heavily ] Get in the car.

400
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:04,791
快点进车
Get in the car!

401
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:06,626
怎么了？
What's wrong?

402
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:35,493
她就在下一条街 离停车场三个街区
She's down the street. Three blocks over in the parking lot.

403
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,996
我们要先杀了那个女刺客
We need to kill the gaijin assassin first.

404
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,159
我们现在就动手吗？
Should we go now?

405
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:46,534
这儿不行 继续跟踪他们
Not here. Keep track ofthem.

406
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:09,293
我是一个杀手
I'm a soccer mom.

407
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:14,955
那你真的靠杀人为生？
So, you, um- you really kill people for a living?

408
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,328
对
Yeah.

409
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:22,168
为什么？
Why?

410
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:27,598
因为我只会这个
It's what I'm good at.

411
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:29,648
这种生活好像很难过
That's messed up.

412
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:34,485
没错
Yeah.

413
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:56,349
哎，哎 你这鲁莽的杀手
Well, well, the reluctant assassin.

414
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:01,124
很抱歉托你下水，曼柯
Sorry to drag you into this, McCabe.

415
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,371
我也很抱歉
Me too.

416
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:06,179
你好，我是艾比
Hi. I'mAbby.

417
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:10,417
你好艾比，不要站在这里了
Hello, Abby. I'm wondering whatyou're doing here.

418
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:13,551
我客房很多 赶快到里面去吧，不用客气哦
There's plentyofroom in the house. Go aheadand helpyourselves to whateveryou need.

419
00:48:13,663 --> 00:48:16,929
- 谢谢 - 不客气
- Thankyou. - You're welcome.

420
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:25,944
你来拌动扳机还是我来？
You want to pull the trigger, or should I do it?

421
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:30,284
你在给我找罪受
Oh, E. You're crashin' on me, baby.

422
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:33,357
我是说你已经惹麻烦了 你还在继续惹麻烦
Isaidyou'dcrash, andyou are crashing.

423
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:36,621
我想找些安全的地方 帮帮我
I just want to get 'em someplace safe, give 'em a chance.

424
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:39,630
他们已经是活死人了 他们没有机会了
They're already dead, E. They got no chance.

425
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,703
不要跟他们一起送死
Don't go down with them.

426
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,208
我需要护照
I'll need passports.

427
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:51,804
还有飞机票
- [ Scoffs ] - I'll need plane tickets.

428
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,818
你还要把机票喂鱼吃
Sure. Throw in some season tickets to the Lakers.

429
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,329
进去吧
Go.

430
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,991
你什么都不要告诉她
[Mark] I don't wantyou to tell heranything.

431
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:24,392
我讨厌撒谎 为什么不能告诉她？
I hate lying. Why can't we tell her?

432
00:49:24,496 --> 00:49:27,988
我们根本不了解她 但她救了我们
- We don't know anything about her. - She saved us.

433
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,728
因为她还不知道我们的真正身份 如果她知道了...
Because she doesn't really know who you are. If she knew-

434
00:49:30,836 --> 00:49:33,066
她是我的朋友 你的朋友？
- She's my friend. - Your friend?

435
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:35,868
她是我唯一的朋友
She's the only one I have.

436
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,704
我不想死... 你不会死的!
- And I do not want to die with- - You're not gonna die!

437
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,020
不准你再说那样的话
Don'tyou ever say that again- ever.

438
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,895
记住吗？ 恩
- Okay? - Yes.

439
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:01,911
艾丽卡
[ Girl] Elektra?

440
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:17,726
怎么了？不好看吗？ 他们帮我改了一下容貌
What's the matter? Is something wrong? They told me to change my appearance, so-

441
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:22,894
不，你看起来不错
No, it's- You look great.

442
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,561
谢谢
Thanks.

443
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:33,774
你能教我怎么用这些东西吧 色拉钳子
Can you show me how to use those things, the, uh, salad tongs?

444
00:50:33,879 --> 00:50:35,813
钢戟 钢戟
- Sais. - Sais.

445
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:40,078
这个不适合你
They're not foryou.

446
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:42,085
我想学习如何防卫自己
I want to learn how to defend myself.

447
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:44,849
这是攻击性武器 专门用来杀人
They're offensive weapons. They're for killing.

448
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:47,288
只能你用
You use them.

449
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:50,020
我不想你像我一样
I don't want you to be like me.

450
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:51,823
但我想
I do.

451
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:02,168
你想学些真的很难的东西吗？
Doyou wanna learn something really, really difficult?

452
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:05,842
想，是什么？
Yeah. What?

453
00:51:05,944 --> 00:51:08,276
过来
Come on.

454
00:51:14,553 --> 00:51:16,544
坐下
Now sit down.

455
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:27,726
闭上眼睛 这是什么，瑜伽术？
- Closeyour eyes. - What is this, yoga?

456
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,460
闭上你的眼睛然后呼吸
Just closeyour eyes and breathe.

457
00:51:29,568 --> 00:51:31,559
我在呼吸 我一直在呼吸
I am breathing, I'm always breathing.

458
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,467
还有闭上嘴
And shut up.

459
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:43,305
安静的坐好
Just sit quietly.

460
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:53,149
你还好吗？
How areyou doing?

461
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:59,645
至少我们还活着 谢谢
We're still alive. Thankyou.

462
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:04,225
不要谢我，马克
Oh, don't thank me, Mark.

463
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,730
你事实上根本不知道我是干吗的
Please, you don't really know what I was doing.

464
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:09,891
你在那里干什么？
Whatyou were doing there?

465
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,094
我当然知道
Sure I do.

466
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:14,103
你是去那里杀我们
You were there to kill us.

467
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,107
当你搬到惠尔莱特那儿的时候 我就知道你是来杀我的
I knew it as soon as you took the Wheelwright place.

468
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:35,793
我不是你适合交往的人
I'm not a good person to get involved with.

469
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:39,362
我才不管
I'm not asking for anything.

470
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,827
对不起
I'm sorry.

471
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:14,160
让人讨厌
Yeah, I hated that.

472
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:50,196
怎么啦？
- [ Bird Squawks ] - What happened?

473
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:53,464
从昨天开始那只鸟 就一直在这里窥探
That bird's been hanging around here since late yesterday.

474
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:02,345
他们来了
They're here.

475
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:06,079
他们来了 我们开车离开
- They're here. - Let's use the truck.

476
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:09,051
来不及了 这是最快的办法了
- We won't make it. - But that's the best way.

477
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:11,054
相信我 我们没有时间了
Trust me. There isn't time.

478
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:14,157
从地窖走 那里有一个密道
Use the cellar. There's a tunnel.

479
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:17,626
它横穿果园 然后到达正北方的灌木层
Takeyou out past the orchard to the trees. Head north.

480
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,663
那你呢？
What aboutyou?

481
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:25,827
该死
- [Loads Gun ] - Shit.

482
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,569
走吧
Let's go.

483
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:35,134
当心点 保证他们的安全
- Be careful. - Keep 'em safe, E.

484
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,503
怪东西
- Holy- - [ Growls ]

485
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:26,522
不要告诉我你是镇上的马戏团的 我告诉你
Don't tell me, the circus is in town, huh? I'll tell you what.

486
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:29,065
你最好现在杀了我 我是不会告诉你任何东西的
You might as well kill me now, 'cause I ain't talking.

487
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,328
没有什么好说的
Talking is not necessary.

488
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:35,133
我答应你前面的请求
- [Yells ] - But I accept the first half ofyour proposal.

489
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,386
他们在树林里
They're in thewoods.

490
00:56:54,526 --> 00:56:56,824
嗨，混蛋
Hey, dickhead.

491
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:01,665
我跟你赌一千块 你肯定比艾丽卡早死
I'll betyou a thousand bucks you're dead before Elektra is.

492
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:07,856
等下
Hold up.

493
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:20,044
跟着我 继续跑
Just follow me. Just keep running.

494
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:27,276
到那里面去 马克，快点
Get in there. Mark, come on. Go. Go.

495
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:12,525
艾丽卡
[ Quietly] Elektra.

496
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:29,043
艾丽卡
- Elektra! - Shh.

497
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:43,225
快跑，艾比
Go! Run, Abby! Run!

498
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:01,545
快走
Go!

499
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:50,343
你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

500
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:03,199
艾丽卡 艾比不要
- Elektra! - Abby, no!

501
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:05,861
让我帮她
Let me go!

502
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:40,563
你就是能量之源是吗？
Ah, you are the little treasure, aren't you?

503
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:43,703
战争要结束了
The war is over.

504
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,547
战争才刚刚开始
The war has just begun.

505
01:02:56,654 --> 01:02:58,815
退后，艾比
Move back, Abby.

506
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:06,088
她没事的
She is safe.

507
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:08,722
后会有期，老人家
Another day, old man.

508
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:24,076
没事了 你好好休息吧
You'll be fine. Rest now.

509
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:37,552
不要寻找你的敌人 要感应他在哪里
Don't look foryour opponent. Know where he is.

510
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:43,355
虽然我瞎了，但我比你看到的更多 因为我不用眼睛寻找
I 'm blind, and I see more than any ofyou, because I don't look.

511
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:00,901
你没有权利托我下水，斯蒂克
You had no right to drag me into this, Stick.

512
01:05:01,012 --> 01:05:02,912
所有和幻影杀手的战争 都是由她而起，是吗？
This whole warwith the Hand, everything, it's all about her, isn't it?

513
01:05:03,014 --> 01:05:05,039
她是他们的能量之源
They call hertheTreasure.

514
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:09,449
她四五岁的时候就已经伸手不凡
She was aprodigy from fourorfiveyears old.

515
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:11,453
很快传到了幻影杀手那里
Wordgot aroundfast.

516
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:15,548
幻影想让她助他们一臂之力 所以想偷她走
The Hand wanted her for themselves. They tried to steal her.

517
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,063
他爸爸又把她偷回来了 你现在又掺入这件事
- Her father spirited her away. - And you set this up-

518
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:23,930
原来都是你雇用我 和曼柯去杀他们的
The contract, McCabe, all of this- you hired me to kill them.

519
01:05:24,035 --> 01:05:26,526
是你自己选择的
You're entitled toyour opinion.

520
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:29,572
一对父女，斯蒂克你居然利用我
A father and his daughter, Stick. You manipulated me.

521
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:33,474
我有吗？
Did I?

522
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:35,909
这原来是一个测验
Was all this a test?

523
01:05:36,013 --> 01:05:39,972
从你赶我出去那一天之后的事情 原来都是一个测验
Everything from the day you threw me out, has it all been a test?

524
01:05:41,986 --> 01:05:44,250
如果我失败会怎么样？
What ifl had failed?

525
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:48,324
有些东西不是教出来的，艾丽卡
Some lessons can't be taught, Elektra.

526
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:51,691
这个需要自己参透
They must be lived to be understood.

527
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,959
当你来的时候，你的内心充满愤怒
When you came here, you were filled with anger.

528
01:05:55,066 --> 01:06:00,333
你的内心被 暴力和悲愤所侵蚀
All the decencyyou once had, poisoned byviolence and tragedy.

529
01:06:00,438 --> 01:06:03,532
这样是无法达到的
This is not the way.

530
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,575
这样是无法达到的
This is not ourway.

531
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:10,970
老人家你又在上课
You talk in riddles, old man.

532
01:06:11,082 --> 01:06:14,074
我想让我的学生提高警惕性
It keeps my students alert.

533
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,780
我知道你的心一直是纯真的
I always knew your heart was pure.

534
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:22,620
你要做的就是要超越自己
You simply needed to see it foryourself.

535
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,105
那艾比呢？
What about Abby?

536
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:38,767
克阮不死 她就不能离开这里
As long as Kirigi is alive, she's only safe here.

537
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:41,845
她没有选择
She has no choice.

538
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:17,373
又偷偷跑到我屋来
Still breaking and entering I see.

539
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,383
对不起
Sorry.

540
01:07:21,485 --> 01:07:23,385
你需要它的 记得要勤加练习
You'll need it. Keep practicing.

541
01:07:27,324 --> 01:07:29,224
对不起我不该对你撒谎
I'm sorry I lied to you.

542
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:33,490
不用道歉 也没有必要
Don't apologize. You did what you needed to do.

543
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:36,532
我不想对你撒谎的
I didn't wanna lie toyou.

544
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:39,865
我爸爸也不想的
Neither did my dad.

545
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:43,232
我一直很难过没有告诉你
It made me sick not telling you.

546
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,433
每个人都在撒谎，艾比 没有人不说谎的
Everybody lies, Abby. Nobody tells the truth about themselves.

547
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:47,374
包括你
Including you.

548
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:50,106
特别是我
Especially me.

549
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:53,342
解雇人，缩减工人薪水 就是那样
- The layoffs and payroll reductions. - Like that.

550
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:55,442
恩，还有那个数数
And the, uh, the counting.

551
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:58,386
- 什么？ - 数步数
- Sorry? - O.C.D.

552
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,684
我没有数步数
I don't have O.C.D.

553
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,919
我小时候数过 但已经是很多年前的事情了
I had it when I was a kid, but I haven't done that in years.

554
01:08:04,028 --> 01:08:07,054
你刚才还在数 当你慢慢走的时候
You were just doing it. When you walk slow like that.

555
01:08:08,732 --> 01:08:11,758
那你在干吗？ 到底是不是在数？
What areyou doing? Areyou counting?

556
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,860
不要无礼
Don't mock me.

557
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:16,405
不管怎么样我还是你的长辈
I'm still your superior.

558
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,407
也许吧
Maybe.

559
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,737
非要跟我比试一下吗？
Wanna find out?

560
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:38,559
我要去找我爸爸
I'm gonna go find my dad.

561
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:03,617
不要乱来
- [ Groans ] - Don't force it.

562
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:05,951
你再硬来
You're forcing it.

563
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:31,376
你很快比我更强
You'll be better than I am very soon.

564
01:09:35,886 --> 01:09:40,482
我只是一个小孩 我不想留在这里
I'm just a kid. I don't wanna stay here.

565
01:11:10,014 --> 01:11:12,778
你想怎样？
What do you want?

566
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:14,783
让我们单独来解决这件事情
To finish it, you and me.

567
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:18,582
我不需要斯蒂克帮忙，你不能让你爸爸帮忙 赢者拿走一切
No help from Stick, no help from your father. Winner take all.

568
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:21,988
如果我杀了你 小孩子就是我们的
And when I kill you, the little one is ours.

569
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:25,493
你不会得逞的 她永远是自由的
And whenyou don't, she is free forever.

570
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:28,224
同意吗？ 同意
- Agreed? - Agreed.

571
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,733
那在老地方见
We will meet where it all began.

572
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:34,861
还要老地方结束我们的恩怨
And it will end where it all began.

573
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:36,872
至少我们做个了断
Foryou, at least.

574
01:15:12,456 --> 01:15:15,016
聪明的孩子
Clever girl.

575
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:26,933
艾丽卡
[ Girl] Elektra!

576
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:30,700
怎么了？ 有什么问题吗？
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

577
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:40,006
我们又见面了
[Kirigi] We meet again.

578
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:17,382
现在你会记起来
Nowyou'll remember.

579
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:15,237
放开她
[Abby] Let her go!

580
01:17:21,818 --> 01:17:24,048
勇敢的孩子 你调教的很好
Brave gi rl. You taught her well.

581
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:04,750
你需要一个新主人
But it's time for a new master.

582
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:22,309
这就是那个瞎子教的？
Is that what the blind man's been teachingyou?

583
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:32,988
还不够 你要学会预见敌人
Not good enough. But you'll learn to anticipate your opponent.

584
01:19:00,484 --> 01:19:02,384
艾比 我不会丢下你的
- Abby- - I'm not leaving you.

585
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:05,148
不过你确实让人担心 就像你一样
- You're a pain in the ass. -Just likeyou.

586
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:17,189
纹身，能量之源就在这里
Tattoo, the Treasure's here.

587
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:53,701
跟紧我
Stay right behind me.

588
01:20:02,646 --> 01:20:04,773
跟紧点，艾比
Stay close, Abby.

589
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,288
艾丽卡
Elektra!

590
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:11,446
魔法耍的不错 我以前领教过
Nice trick. I've seen it before.

591
01:21:28,765 --> 01:21:31,393
艾比，你在哪里？
Abby, where are you?

592
01:21:33,637 --> 01:21:36,936
艾丽卡 可惜不是
- Elektra? - Not exactly.

593
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,650
我曾经是力量之源
You know, I used to be the Treasure...

594
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:57,989
我不喜欢被人代替
and I don't like being replaced.

595
01:21:58,094 --> 01:22:01,860
我们两个只能活一个
So let's keep your death between you and me.

596
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:11,474
艾比
Abby!

597
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:13,339


598
01:23:48,838 --> 01:23:51,033
你不行了艾丽卡
You're slipping, Elektra.

599
01:23:51,141 --> 01:23:54,372
快点，踩水，踩水...
Come on, let's go. Push, push, push.

600
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,679
快点，踩水、踩水...
[Father] Let's go. Let's push, push, push, push!

601
01:24:00,016 --> 01:24:04,749
坚持住，艾丽卡 坚持住
- Keep going, Elektra. Keep going. - [Man ] Don't worry, Elektra.

602
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:06,845
我只是一个孩子 我会好好照顾她的
- I'm just a kid. - I'll take good care ofher.

603
01:24:06,956 --> 01:24:09,049
我不想待在这里
I don't wanna stay here.

604
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:11,389
艾丽卡
Elektra.

605
01:24:13,997 --> 01:24:17,455
不要担心，艾丽卡 我会好好照顾她的
Don't worry, Elektra. I'll take good care of her.

606
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,775
艾比
Abby.

607
01:25:33,877 --> 01:25:36,778
该死，快点
Damn it. Come on.

608
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:57,629
我再也不害怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

609
01:26:06,843 --> 01:26:09,334
艾比
Abby.

610
01:26:09,445 --> 01:26:12,505
艾比听我说 听我说
Abby, listen to me. Listen to me.

611
01:26:42,145 --> 01:26:44,045
我知道你的心一直是纯洁的
[Stick's Voice ] I always knewyourheart was pure.

612
01:26:44,147 --> 01:26:48,880
但你要超越自己
You simplyneeded to see it foryourself.

613
01:27:09,172 --> 01:27:11,072
嗨，女战士
Hey, warrior girl.

614
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:15,042
快点醒来
Come here.

615
01:27:15,144 --> 01:27:17,305
醒来，艾比
Come here, Abby.

616
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,079
我需要你 我刚刚找到你
I need you. I just found you.

617
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,913
我刚刚找到你
I just found you.

618
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:51,410
嗨
Hi.

619
01:28:27,116 --> 01:28:29,084
谢谢
Thankyou.

620
01:28:37,226 --> 01:28:38,955
对不起
Sorry.

621
01:28:39,062 --> 01:28:41,121
你真讨厌
Yeah, I hated that.

622
01:29:21,437 --> 01:29:26,033
下一步准备干什么，克阮已经死了 没有人追杀你了
So, what's next? Kirigi's gone. No one's afteryou.

623
01:29:28,044 --> 01:29:30,274
去上学？
Back to school?

624
01:29:31,781 --> 01:29:34,272
到海滩来个日光浴 还有冰激凌
- Go to the beach and get a tan. - And get ice cream.

625
01:29:34,383 --> 01:29:37,648
噢
[ Laughs ] Oh.

626
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:47,795
是你重新给我生命
You gave me my life back.

627
01:29:53,803 --> 01:29:55,862
是你让我参悟我的人生
You gave me mine.

628
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:04,575
我还能再见到你吗？
Will I seeyou again?

629
01:30:13,556 --> 01:30:15,649
我们会在意念内相会
We'll find each other.

630
01:30:53,596 --> 01:30:56,360
希望她不要走我的路
Please don't let her be like me.

631
01:30:56,465 --> 01:30:58,365
为什么不？
Whynot?

632
01:30:58,467 --> 01:31:00,367
其实你还不错
You didn't turn out so bad.

633
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,640
我不想看她太生活的太累
I don't want it to be so hard for her.

634
01:31:06,742 --> 01:31:09,040
这个要由她来决定
That's up to her.

635
01:31:12,248 --> 01:31:16,150
你复活的第二次生命 是不是跟原来的大所不同？
Anyway, your second life's never really likeyour first, is it?

636
01:31:16,252 --> 01:31:18,482
有时候...
Sometimes...

637
01:31:18,588 --> 01:31:20,488
比以前的生活更精彩
it's even better.
