1
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,907
自天地初開之時
[Man Narrating] Since time began...

2
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,977
世界就被一場在
a war has been waged in the shadows...

3
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,206
正義和邪惡之間的戰爭所籠罩著
between the armies ofGood and Evil.

4
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:23,683
這場戰爭可能驚天地泣鬼魂
It may be fought on a grand scale...

5
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:26,805
也可能只是在小孩之間的心魔之戰
or within the heart ofa single individual-or even a child.

6
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,982


7
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,450
邪惡力量無處不在
The Evil has taken many forms...

8
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,430
它被黑暗所支配著
and used the darkest ofarts.

9
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,024
在現代，他們被稱作
In our time, they call themselves simply...

10
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:43,036
幻影殺手
the Hand.

11
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:46,767
正義總是站在善良的一方
The Good follow the way ofki magure.

12
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,105
仁慈之主不但可以看到未來
Its masters can see the future...

13
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:53,340
甚至能夠起死回生
and perhaps even bring back the dead.

14
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:56,351
這是個武魂的傳奇故事
Legend tells of a unique warrior...

15
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,581
她是一顆失落的靈魂
a lost soul.

16
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,019
她是個女戰士
This warrior is a woman...

17
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,023
她是個孤兒
a motherless daughter.

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:08,529
上天安排她去平息這場 正義與邪惡之戰
And it is her destiny to tip the balance between Good and Evil.

19
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,623
有個小孩是力量之源 雙方都需要她的協助
She is a treasure, and both sides seek her out...

20
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:16,226
她將成為戰爭中的終極武器
as a final weapon in an ancient war.

21
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:27,150
片名：艾麗卡 又名：幻影殺手

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,482
- 你那有什麼動靜嗎？ - 一切正常
- [ Man ] Perimeter, what's your status? - [ Man #2 ] Delta team, clear.

23
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,383
- 一切正常 - 一切正常
- [ Man #3 ] Alpha, clear. - [ Man #4 ] Bravo, secure.

24
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,786
沒有用的
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,292
你阻止不了她的
You can't stop her.

26
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:43,387
- 沒人能阻止她 - 就憑她？
- Nobody can stop her. - Her?

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,863
恐怕這次你無法完成任務
I was afraid if I told you, you wouldn't take the job.

28
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,870
我本來是不想請你出山的
I never should've hired you.

29
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,313
衝你來的那個人到底是誰？
Who doyou think's coming foryou?

30
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:02,042
你也許聽說過她，她叫…
You may have heard ofher. Her name...

31
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,485
艾麗卡
is Elektra.

32
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,020
- 你覺得這個很好笑嗎？ - 她是城裡一段傳奇
- You find that funny? - She's an urban legend, sir.

33
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,060
幾年前就死了
That woman died years ago.

34
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:17,962
真的？ 那應該派人把她的屍體帶回來
Really? Well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.

35
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,263
鮑爾，知道嗎？ 我們的所作所為
You know, Bauer, whenyou've done the things I've done...

36
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,735
給我們樹立了好多敵人
you make a lot of enemies.

37
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:28,867
我花巨款買來的密報說
My private security detail- the best money could buy.

38
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,413
這個死掉的女人 在半個小時內殺了14個人
This nonexistent woman killed 1 4 of them in half an hour.

39
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,415
我都不敢離開這裡
I barelygot away.

40
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:40,545
奇怪的是，在蒙特卡洛時 她居然放過我
Spent the next two days in Monte Carlo wondering why she let me go.

41
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,850
而現在卻又向我殺來
Then she came for me.

42
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:47,122
原本是幻影殺手負責我的安全 而她曾經是他們的一分子
I was underthe protection ofthe Hand itself, who sent theirbest.

43
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,790
現在組織為了殺她 已經不管我得死活
Although theyseemed more interested in killing Elektra than in protecting me.

44
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,133
把這些保鏢碾個粉碎
She cut 'em down I i ke wheat.

45
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,133
她只需要10分鐘，最多15分鐘
T ook maybe 1 0, 1 5 m i nutes max.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,075
我不能再袖手旁觀
Didn't really think why I kept gettin' away.

47
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,577
這是我來的目的
So here I am.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,580
我現在瞭解她了
And now I understand her.

49
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,451
她想讓我嘗嘗這種滋味
She wanted me to feel this...

50
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,750
像是走頭無路
what it's like to have nowhere to go...

51
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,915
無人求援
nowhere to turn.

52
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,693
你現在感覺怎麼樣？
How's yourperimeter doing now?

53
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,101
德爾塔，你那裡情況怎麼樣？
Delta, what's your status?

54
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,401
沒有反應 臭婊子
There's no signal. Son of a bitch.

55
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,773
- 你知道嗎，這種刺客喜歡 - 阿爾法，布萊歐，請回答
- You know, the better the assassin- -Alpha, Bravo, report!

56
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,869
在你知道她的行蹤之前 她會先慢慢逼近，然後幹掉你
the closer they can get to you before you know they're there.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,608
阿爾法，布萊歐，請回答
Alpha! Bravo! Report!

58
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,877
該死
- [ Static ] - Ah, Christ.

59
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,784
他們說在艾麗卡殺你之前 會在你耳邊說悄悄話
They say Elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you.

60
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:53,224
- 阿爾法，布萊歐，請回答 - 老闆現在太晚了，鮑爾
- Alpha! Bravo! Report! - [ Woman ] It's too late foryour boss, Bauer.

61
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,228
- 但你還是有機會的 - 哦，該死
- But you still have a chance. -Jesus Christ!

62
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,030
你無法與鬼魂戰鬥
[Woman ] You can't fight a ghost, Bauer.

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,232
該到我們了
- Here we are at last. - [ Exhales ]

64
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,406
跟傳說的一模一樣
Guess it's all true.

65
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,908
紅色的衣服 還有那把刀
The red outfit and the knives and-

66
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,312
現在你想怎麼樣？
So, what happens now?

67
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:22,076
毫不猶豫地殺了我？
You just kill me, straight out? Just cold?

68
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:25,243
不要怕 死亡並不是一件很可怕的事
Don't worry. Death's not that bad.

69
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,548
是嗎？你怎麼知道？
Yeah? How do you know?

70
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,796
我已經死過一次
[ Whispering ] I died once.

71
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,932
是什麼感覺？ 有沒有...
What's it like? Is there...

72
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:44,630
白光和上帝？
you know, a white light and God?

73
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:49,701
我想 我就要知道了
What- I guess I'll find out.

74
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,377
我也明白幻影殺手的力量
So am I to understand that with all the power ofthe Hand...

75
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,207
我們的頭號殺手 還在躲避著我們？
that the Treasure continues to elude us?

76
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:28,749
對，我們本應該更早點採取行動
Yes. Perhaps ifwe had pursued it sooner...

77
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,750
向她發動更大的攻勢
and more aggressively-

78
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,480
你膽敢怪罪幫主羅侍郎？
You dare to blame Master Roshi?

79
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:36,216
也許克阮你太掉以輕心了
Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi.

80
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,224
根本沒有
Not at all, sensei.

81
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,487
如果我們不能得到這個力量之源
But ifwe cannot have the weapon ourselves...

82
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:45,089
也不能讓她落入敵人的手裡
allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands ofthose who may use it against us.

83
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,258
幫主，請讓我插幾句
Master, allow me.

84
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,929
這個事情一定要盡快地 悄悄地解決
Things like this must be handled smoothly, quietly.

85
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,236
那就悄悄地去辦吧，馬之密 但一定要快
Then work smoothly, Meizumi, but quickly.

86
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:08,347
克阮
Kirigi?

87
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,016
什麼事？爸爸
Yes, Father.

88
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,093
耐心點
Patience.

89
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,731
你怎麼門都不鎖 一點安全意識都沒有
[Man ] You think that's safe, leaving the door unlocked like that?

90
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,064
艾麗卡，一顆子彈就能結束你
Geez, Elektra, you're gonna end up with a bullet in your head.

91
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,571
我給你帶了點東西
I brought you a little something.

92
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:36,235
等下，不要放在那裡 我剛剛擦好
No, stop, McCabe. Don't put it down. I al ready cleaned there.

93
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,711
- 為什麼你整天的清洗這裡？ - 擦除我的DNA
- Why do you always do this? - Get rid of my D.N.A.

94
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:45,183
啊，DNA，說得沒錯
Ah, D.N.A., of course. Right.

95
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:48,744
我真傻，這個是我剛拿到的 你一定想看看
Silly of me. Listen, I just picked this up. I knowyou like to look.

96
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,619
- 全部在裡面了？ - 連我的一成也沒到
- It's all there? - Less my 1 0%.

97
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,862
- 到巴巴多斯島拿一半 - 還有一半要到馬恩島拿
- Halfto Barbados? - And halfto the bank on the Isle of Man.

98
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,462
其實你可以賺更多 我知道一個人，我幫你聯繫他
You can do better in mutual funds. I know a guy. I could putyou in touch-

99
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:09,407
- 不用了，謝謝 - 不要了？但是...
- No, thanks. - Or not. But-

100
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,941
聽我說，其實我不想干涉你的事情
Look, I don't want to tell you how to doyour thing...

101
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,212
但是這一次 有很多人搶這個生意
but quite a body count on this one, E.

102
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,348
難道我們只能為丹馬克賣命
We were only getting paid for DeMarco.

103
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,928
非得這樣嗎？
Was it necessary?

104
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,498
是不得不
Had to be done.

105
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,831
是嗎？
Did it?

106
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,632
艾麗卡
Elektra.

107
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,866
是嗎？
Did it?

108
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,715
好吧
Okay.

109
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,510
我們要緊尊師父的教誨
Anyway, it spreads the legend.

110
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,450
否則，我會死的
Besides, theywere gonna kill me.

111
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,954
這個說的沒錯
Of course they were. Absolutely.

112
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,321
但是聽你的特工小組說
And, speaking ofwhich, as your agent...

113
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:01,725
這是一件及其重要的任務
I am obligated to tell you we just got an absolutely fantastic new offer...

114
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,992
- 也是你最後的任務 - 我們不要談這個了，我需要休息一下
- but that last job- - Let's skip this one. I need a breather.

115
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,500
- 那好吧，我只是說這次報酬很高 - 我已經很累了
- Great idea. I'm just sayin' it's a lot of coin. - I'm tired.

116
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,037
你真的累了？ 那你還真需要好好睡一覺
You're tired? Well, then you better getyourselfsome sleep...

117
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,232
否則你很快會垮掉的
'causeyou are gonna crash, baby, you know that.

118
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,366
你好像從來都沒有休息過的樣子
I mean, you even get laid?

119
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,646
這次任務報酬真的很多
It's a lot of money, this new offer.

120
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,879
- 曼柯 - 好，好吧
- McCabe. - All right, fine. You know what?

121
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:30,924
那你慢慢休息一下 你想行動的時候打電話給我
Look, you want to take time off, take time off. Call me when you wanna work.

122
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,984
多少錢？說吧
How much? And just tell me.

123
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:37,223
兩百萬
Two.

124
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,697
他們也可能雇其他殺手
Ah, they'll give it to somebody else.

125
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,429
他們不會付給別人這麼多的
Theywouldn't pay that to somebody else.

126
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,437
你說得對
You got that right.

127
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,575
他們很想你去處理這件事
They asked specifically foryou.

128
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,478
地點在那裡面 找到目標以後通知你
Location's in there. I'll call you when I get the target.

129
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:58,552
好好睡會吧
Get some sleep.

130
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,565
再試一次
- Again! - [ Man ] Clear!

131
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,533
你知道你的方向嗎，艾麗卡
[Man's Voice ] Doyou knowthe way, Elektra?

132
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,744
意念，可以讓你控制時間

我知道我是這裡最好的學生

你明白暴力和痛苦

但你還沒有領悟到突破的出路

艾麗卡

245
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,534
一點都不
Not really.

246
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:49,270
爸爸，當她看我這個美男子 像是超越了她所有的朋友
[Abby] So when she sees all the cute guys who like me- just as friends, Dad-

247
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:53,410
她決定把我畫在泰姬陵的牆上 作為他們的代表
she accidentally spills posterpaint all over my model ofthe Taj Mahal.

248
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,784
後來我在她的鼻子上塗了點膠水
So I put gl ue on her shoes.

249
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,653
結果她停止了計劃畫我的工程 後來由於打架我被趕出了那裡
I got suspended for that, and then I got expelled for fighting.

250
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,785

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,464
我很好奇你為什麼租了 惠爾萊特的房子
So, I was a little surprised to seeyou take the Wheelwright place.

253
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,799
因為很少有人 會在這個時候租他的房子的
Not manyrenters this time ofyear.

254
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,805

No, it is boring. I like your bracelet, by the way.

260
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,182
你知道它代表什麼嗎？
Do you know what those are? Here.

261
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,851
這是源於印尼水晶珠 它代表武士道精神
They're warrior beads. They're from Indonesia.

262
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,361
在古代，只有村莊 最好的武士才配戴它
Centuries ago, you had to be the best fighter in yourvillage to earn them.

263
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,695
我從網上買的
I bought 'em off eBay.

264
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,606
這島上有學校嗎？
Is there a school here on the island?

265
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,802
我們打算先進行一段家庭式的教育
Uh, we're tryinghomeschooling fora while.

266
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,675
我讀過大學的書 自己也可以學代數
I read at college level. And I'm doing algebra one on my own.

267
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,338
她是個不錯的學生
She's a goodstudent.

268
00:26:55,449 --> 00:27:00,284
但是他的行為卻總是讓我失望
It's the, uh, behavioral stuff that's been a problem.

269
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,719
我有權力干自己喜歡的事 我沒有必要非聽那些嘮叨
I have authority issues, and I don't take bullshit well.

270
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:05,519
- 不要這樣對你爸說 - 嗨，艾比
- Don't speak in that- - Hey, Abby!

271
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,763
沒關係
It's okay.

272
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,135
這麼快她已經是個大人了
Suddenly I got a teenager on my hands.

273
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,506
- 其實她很努力 - 你可以直接跟她說
- She's hard on herself. - You can tell, huh?

274
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,339
- 很多人認為她很懶 - 不，我不認為
- Most people think she's a slacker. - No, I shouldn't.

275
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,349
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas?

276
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,165
她媽媽呢？
Where's her mother?

277
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:51,007
她很多年前就死了
She died... a couple ofyears ago.

278
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:54,070
在巴爾的摩？
Back in Baltimore?

279
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,872
對，酒後駕車
Yeah. Drunk driver.

280
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,887
我很小的時候媽媽就死了
My mother died when I was young.

281
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,491
我應該回去了
I should go.

282
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,476
- 我還有工作要做 - 不是吧，天還早呢
- I have work. - Come on, it's early.

283
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,465
多謝晚餐
Thanks for dinner.

284
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,739
媽媽
Mom.

285
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,187
- 什麼事？
- [ Beeps ] - What?

286
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,167
看你的郵包

287
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,054
- 這次是兩個人 - 所以賺雙份錢
- It's a double. - Which makes double the money.

288
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:45,536
這正是賺這麼多錢的原因
Yeah, that's why the big bucks.

289
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,753
- 怎麼了？ - 沒事
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

290
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,763
好吧，沒問題最好
Good. Then there'll be no problems.

291
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:01,835
解決了我會打電話給你
I'll call you when it's done.

292
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,645
你的數學怎麼樣了？
How's math going?

293
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,424
你覺得呢？
How doyou think it's going?

294
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,034
什麼，你居然沒殺他們 是現在不行還是永遠不行
What doyou mean, you're not doing it? Not now or not ever?

295
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,644
- 有太多因素了，背景比較複雜 - 背景？
- Too manyvariables. Not enough background. - Background?

296
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:29,081
好吧，那聖誕節到明尼蘇打洲怎樣？
Okay, well, how about, uh, born in Minnesota on Christmas Day.

297
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:32,345
想不想看冰魚和龍這部電影？
Enjoys, uh, ice fishing and dragon movies.

298
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,250
我要離開這裡 我定下來再給你電話
McCabe, I'm out ofhere. I'll call you when I land someplace.

299
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,843
他們會馬上派別人來的
They'll just send somebody else, E.

300
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,765
我們所預測的暴風雨終於降臨了
The storm we've been waiting- all- finally here.

301
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,771
- 暴風雨移到了西雅圖的塔科馬地區 - 我到倉庫去拿沙袋
- It's moved into the Seattle-Tacoma area. - I'll getsandbags from the shed.

302
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:09,669
他們在說笑吧，說得這麼激動 這只是一場雨而已
You know, this is such a joke. They make it sound all exciting, but you know it's just rain.

303
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:14,101
你如果不是很忙 就把窗戶粘好
Ifyou're not too busy, young lady, feel free to tape the windows.

304
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:17,102
馬上去
Now!

305
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,457
馬克

306
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,623
我能跟你談談嗎？
Can I talk to you?

307
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,063
我們能進屋說嗎？
Can we talk inside?

308
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,221
當然可以
Yeah, sure.

309
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:25,688
嗨，到底什麼事？
Hey, what's up?

310
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:28,724
艾比，你能先去裡面房間嗎？ 我要跟你爸談事情
Can you go to your bedroom for a minute, Abby? I need to talk to your dad.

311
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,814
快去

312
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,857
去吧，艾比
Go, Abby.

313
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,787
- 你到底是誰？跟我說實話 - 什麼?
- Who are you? Don't lie to me. - What?

314
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,947
他們不僅要殺你
Theywon'tjust killyou.

315
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:46,614
還要殺了艾比
They'll kill Abby.

316
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:50,120
- 媽的 - 爸爸
- Damn it! - Dad!

317
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:52,051
快走
Go!

318
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,644
快跑艾比 到浴室去，快點跑
Run, Abby! Bathroom! Go! Go! Go!

319
00:35:56,923 --> 00:36:05,033
- 別離開艾比 - 好的
- Staywith Abby! - Okay.

320
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:24,749
艾比
[Mark ] Abby!

321
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:18,487
- 艾麗卡 - 艾比
- Elektra! - Abby!

322
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,273
誰派你來的？
[ Speaking Japanese ]

323
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,904
你很快就知道了

324
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,219
壞了
Damn it.

325
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,986
退後
Get back!

326
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:16,721
快點退後
Get back! Go!

327
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,626
走
[ Mark] Go.

328
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,403
他們馬上就會到
There'll be more coming.

329
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,405
而且更厲害
What's coming next will be worse.

330
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:46,117
我想克阮對幻影理事會有話要說
I believe Kirigi wishes to address the Council ofthe Hand.

331
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,813
尊敬的主人
Venerable master...

332
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:52,084
儘管你是如此的精明能幹
despite your delicacy and subtlety...

333
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:55,490
你卻沒能處理好能量之源
you have failed to solve the problem ofthe Treasure.

334
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:00,766
羅侍郎幫主已經把這個任務交給我
Master Roshi gave that task to me.

335
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,700
- 沒錯 - 我的手下會處理好的
- Yes, exactly. - And my men are taking care of it.

336
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,703
你的手下已經死了
Your men are dead!

337
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:07,932
是被那個殺手艾麗卡殺的
Killed bythe female, Elektra, the gaijin.

338
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,046
專橫的人讓人可恨
Your forces are an abomination!

339
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:06,498
羅侍郎幫主
Master Roshi...

340
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,000
幻影組織絕不能 失去這一代的能量之源
the Hand cannot afford to lose the Treasure for another generation.

341
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,935
所以我誠心的要求接受這個任務
So I humbly request you allow me this task.

342
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,132
也許我還是比較適合的
Perhaps with a little less delicacy...

343
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,142
至少我是不會輸給一個女人
my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman.

344
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,303
這個任務就交給你了
The task is yours.

345
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:24,782
好好完成它 把你的領導能力證明給理事會
Complete it, andyou will have proven yourselfworthy ofleading this council.

346
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:29,345
我會置身事外
I will step aside.

347
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,576
幻影殺手的人
[ McCabe ] The Hand ofall people.

348
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,649
這次誰幫你擺平這件事情
So who's gonna help you out on this one, E?

349
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,650
- 斯迪克？ - 告訴我他的地址
- Stick? -J ust give me his location.

350
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:02,277
沒問題 我有把握
Sure, no problem. I got it handled.

351
00:42:02,388 --> 00:42:04,288
該死的
Goddamn it.

352
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:23,942
輪到你了，盲人
[ Sighs ] You're up, blind man.

353
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,945
你雙色，我要連進兩球然後反彈再進三球 順序是4 3 2 1 6
Double combo: triple carom on the four-three-two-one-six with a bank masse.

354
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:30,777
你不用把所有的都想像到這一槍上 這只是第一槍
Uh, you don't need to call all your shots, Pops.Just the first one.

355
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,783
沒錯就要這第一槍
That is the first one.

356
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,550
哇，你真會跟我開玩笑
Whoa, whoa. Aw, you gotta be kidding me.

357
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:52,268
8號球在角落裡
Eight ball in the corner.

358
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,574
- 盲人？臭屁阿 - 把你的錢放在台桌上
- Blind, myass. - Leave your money on the table.

359
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:16,161
給你點錢去玩會彈球
Here's a dollar, Abs. Go play some pinball.

360
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:19,925
- 為什麼總是趕我走 - 快去
- Why do I always have to miss the good stuff? -Just go.

361
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:28,563
艾麗卡，還是那樣的走路方式
Elektra. Same walk.

362
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:30,835
那一種香水
Same perfume.

363
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,774
他們需要你的幫助
They need your help.

364
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,778
到這兒來
Over here.

365
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,280
這是馬克·米勒
This is Mark Miller.

366
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,927
馬克和他女兒被幻影殺手追殺
Mark and his daughter, Abby, are being chased by the Hand...

367
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:50,881
他們需要你的保護
andtheyneedyourprotection.

368
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,799
我把他們留在你這裡 殺手你來應付，然後我就不管了
I'm leaving them with you. The Hand is your business, not mine.

369
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,735
對了，克阮 他們已經派克阮來了
Ah, Kirigi. They've sent Kirigi.

370
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:00,502
媽的
Shit.

371
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:03,100
你有沒有問他們 殺手為什麼要追殺他們？
Didyou everask whythe Hand was afterthem?

372
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:08,184
- 他們不知道 - 真的？米勒你不知道?
- They don't know. - Really? Mr. Miller doesn't know?

373
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,418
其實我知道
I do know.

374
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:17,543
幻影殺手想要的東西 他卻不想給
The Hand wantedsomething he couldn't give.

375
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,429
他想逃跑
He tried to run.

376
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:22,764
然後呢？
And what?

377
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:25,222
他們殺了我妻子，艾比的媽媽
They killed my wife, Abby's mom.

378
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:27,950
她不是酒後駕車 是我撒謊了
There was no drunk driver. I lied.

379
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,567
你自己的事情自己解決吧
You're on your own.

380
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,576
你到底為什麼要救他們，艾麗卡？
Why didyou reallysave them, Elektra?

381
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:37,821
難道是為了懺悔？ 為你所作所為贖罪？
Some kind of penance? A down payment on your sins?

382
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:41,458
她告訴你她實際是幹什麼的了 米勒先生？
Has she toldyou what she actually does for a living, Mr. Miller?

383
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:44,995
她救了我和我的女兒 這個已經足夠了
She saved my life and my daughter's. That's enough for me.

384
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:47,589
而你想利用她對你的好感
Thenyou landed on the luckyside ofthe street.

385
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,520
該死你說什麼
- Damn, you son of a bitch! - Because with most people-

386
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,153
艾麗卡
Well, Elektra...

387
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:08,183
你一點沒變
you haven't changed.

388
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,638
我們去哪？
What are we gonna do?

389
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,965
艾麗卡？ 我們到底去哪？
Elektra? What are we gonna do?

390
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:25,566
你快點逃命吧 越遠越好，越快越好
You gotta run. As far as you can, as fast as you can.

391
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,997
南美，非洲 改名換姓，改容換貌
SouthAmerica. Africa. Changeyourname. Changeyourappearance.

392
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,432
- 你不跟我們一塊走？ - 不
- You're not coming with us? - No.

393
00:45:35,907 --> 00:45:40,144
- 我不能 - 為什麼不？你難道沒有什麼藏身之處？
- I can't. - Why not? Isn't that part ofyour code or something?

394
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:42,239
我沒有，艾比
I don't have a code, Abby.

395
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,592
- 那我們怎麼保護自己？ - 我們沒有事的，艾比
- How are we supposed to defend ourselves? - We'll be okay, Abby.

396
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:47,728
我們根本不行
No, we won't.

397
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:49,940
醒醒吧爸爸，我們力單物薄
Wake up, Dad. We won't!

398
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,109
他們要殺了我們 像對付媽媽那樣
They're gonna hunt us down. Just like Mom.

399
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,325
快點進車
[ Breathing Heavily ] Get in the car.

400
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:04,791
快點進車
Get in the car!

401
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:06,626
怎麼了？
What's wrong?

402
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:35,493
她就在下一條街 離停車場三個街區
She's down the street. Three blocks over in the parking lot.

403
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,996
我們要先殺了那個女刺客
We need to kill the gaijin assassin first.

404
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,159
我們現在就動手嗎？
Should we go now?

405
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:46,534
這兒不行 繼續跟蹤他們
Not here. Keep track ofthem.

406
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:09,293
我是一個殺手
I'm a soccer mom.

407
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:14,955
那你真的靠殺人為生？
So, you, um- you really kill people for a living?

408
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,328
對
Yeah.

409
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:22,168
為什麼？
Why?

410
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:27,598
因為我只會這個
It's what I'm good at.

411
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:29,648
這種生活好像很難過
That's messed up.

412
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:34,485
沒錯
Yeah.

413
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:56,349
哎，哎 你這魯莽的殺手
Well, well, the reluctant assassin.

414
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:01,124
很抱歉托你下水，曼柯
Sorry to drag you into this, McCabe.

415
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,371
我也很抱歉
Me too.

416
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:06,179
你好，我是艾比
Hi. I'mAbby.

417
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:10,417
你好艾比，不要站在這裡了
Hello, Abby. I'm wondering whatyou're doing here.

418
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:13,551
我客房很多 趕快到裡面去吧，不用客氣哦
There's plentyofroom in the house. Go aheadand helpyourselves to whateveryou need.

419
00:48:13,663 --> 00:48:16,929
- 謝謝 - 不客氣
- Thankyou. - You're welcome.

420
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:25,944
你來拌動扳機還是我來？
You want to pull the trigger, or should I do it?

421
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:30,284
你在給我找罪受
Oh, E. You're crashin' on me, baby.

422
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:33,357
我是說你已經惹麻煩了 你還在繼續惹麻煩
Isaidyou'dcrash, andyou are crashing.

423
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:36,621
我想找些安全的地方 幫幫我
I just want to get 'em someplace safe, give 'em a chance.

424
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:39,630
他們已經是活死人了 他們沒有機會了
They're already dead, E. They got no chance.

425
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,703
不要跟他們一起送死
Don't go down with them.

426
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,208
我需要護照
I'll need passports.

427
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:51,804
還有飛機票
- [ Scoffs ] - I'll need plane tickets.

428
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,818
你還要把機票餵魚吃
Sure. Throw in some season tickets to the Lakers.

429
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,329
進去吧
Go.

430
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,991
你什麼都不要告訴她
[Mark] I don't wantyou to tell heranything.

431
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:24,392
我討厭撒謊 為什麼不能告訴她？
I hate lying. Why can't we tell her?

432
00:49:24,496 --> 00:49:27,988
我們根本不瞭解她 但她救了我們
- We don't know anything about her. - She saved us.

433
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,728
因為她還不知道我們的真正身份 如果她知道了...
Because she doesn't really know who you are. If she knew-

434
00:49:30,836 --> 00:49:33,066
她是我的朋友 你的朋友？
- She's my friend. - Your friend?

435
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:35,868
她是我唯一的朋友
She's the only one I have.

436
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,704
我不想死... 你不會死的!
- And I do not want to die with- - You're not gonna die!

437
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,020
不准你再說那樣的話
Don'tyou ever say that again- ever.

438
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,895
記住嗎？ 恩
- Okay? - Yes.

439
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:01,911
艾麗卡
[ Girl] Elektra?

440
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:17,726
怎麼了？不好看嗎？ 他們幫我改了一下容貌
What's the matter? Is something wrong? They told me to change my appearance, so-

441
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:22,894
不，你看起來不錯
No, it's- You look great.

442
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,561
謝謝
Thanks.

443
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:33,774
你能教我怎麼用這些東西吧 色拉鉗子
Can you show me how to use those things, the, uh, salad tongs?

444
00:50:33,879 --> 00:50:35,813
鋼戟 鋼戟
- Sais. - Sais.

445
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:40,078
這個不適合你
They're not foryou.

446
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:42,085
我想學習如何防衛自己
I want to learn how to defend myself.

447
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:44,849
這是攻擊性武器 專門用來殺人
They're offensive weapons. They're for killing.

448
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:47,288
只能你用
You use them.

449
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:50,020
我不想你像我一樣
I don't want you to be like me.

450
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:51,823
但我想
I do.

451
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:02,168
你想學些真的很難的東西嗎？
Doyou wanna learn something really, really difficult?

452
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:05,842
想，是什麼？
Yeah. What?

453
00:51:05,944 --> 00:51:08,276
過來
Come on.

454
00:51:14,553 --> 00:51:16,544
坐下
Now sit down.

455
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:27,726
閉上眼睛 這是什麼，瑜伽術？
- Closeyour eyes. - What is this, yoga?

456
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,460
閉上你的眼睛然後呼吸
Just closeyour eyes and breathe.

457
00:51:29,568 --> 00:51:31,559
我在呼吸 我一直在呼吸
I am breathing, I'm always breathing.

458
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,467
還有閉上嘴
And shut up.

459
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:43,305
安靜的坐好
Just sit quietly.

460
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:53,149
你還好嗎？
How areyou doing?

461
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:59,645
至少我們還活著 謝謝
We're still alive. Thankyou.

462
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:04,225
不要謝我，馬克
Oh, don't thank me, Mark.

463
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,730
你事實上根本不知道我是幹嗎的
Please, you don't really know what I was doing.

464
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:09,891
你在那裡幹什麼？
Whatyou were doing there?

465
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,094
我當然知道
Sure I do.

466
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:14,103
你是去那裡殺我們
You were there to kill us.

467
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,107
當你搬到惠爾萊特那兒的時候 我就知道你是來殺我的
I knew it as soon as you took the Wheelwright place.

468
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:35,793
我不是你適合交往的人
I'm not a good person to get involved with.

469
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:39,362
我才不管
I'm not asking for anything.

470
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,827
對不起
I'm sorry.

471
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:14,160
讓人討厭
Yeah, I hated that.

472
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:50,196
怎麼啦？
- [ Bird Squawks ] - What happened?

473
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:53,464
從昨天開始那隻鳥 就一直在這裡窺探
That bird's been hanging around here since late yesterday.

474
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:02,345
他們來了
They're here.

475
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:06,079
他們來了 我們開車離開
- They're here. - Let's use the truck.

476
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:09,051
來不及了 這是最快的辦法了
- We won't make it. - But that's the best way.

477
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:11,054
相信我 我們沒有時間了
Trust me. There isn't time.

478
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:14,157
從地窖走 那裡有一個密道
Use the cellar. There's a tunnel.

479
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:17,626
它橫穿果園 然後到達正北方的灌木層
Takeyou out past the orchard to the trees. Head north.

480
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,663
那你呢？
What aboutyou?

481
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:25,827
該死
- [Loads Gun ] - Shit.

482
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,569
走吧
Let's go.

483
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:35,134
當心點 保證他們的安全
- Be careful. - Keep 'em safe, E.

484
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,503
怪東西
- Holy- - [ Growls ]

485
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:26,522
不要告訴我你是鎮上的馬戲團的 我告訴你
Don't tell me, the circus is in town, huh? I'll tell you what.

486
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:29,065
你最好現在殺了我 我是不會告訴你任何東西的
You might as well kill me now, 'cause I ain't talking.

487
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,328
沒有什麼好說的
Talking is not necessary.

488
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:35,133
我答應你前面的請求
- [Yells ] - But I accept the first half ofyour proposal.

489
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,386
他們在樹林裡
They're in thewoods.

490
00:56:54,526 --> 00:56:56,824
嗨，混蛋
Hey, dickhead.

491
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:01,665
我跟你賭一千塊 你肯定比艾麗卡早死
I'll betyou a thousand bucks you're dead before Elektra is.

492
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:07,856
等下
Hold up.

493
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:20,044
跟著我 繼續跑
Just follow me. Just keep running.

494
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:27,276
到那裡面去 馬克，快點
Get in there. Mark, come on. Go. Go.

495
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:12,525
艾麗卡
[ Quietly] Elektra.

496
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:29,043
艾麗卡
- Elektra! - Shh.

497
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:43,225
快跑，艾比
Go! Run, Abby! Run!

498
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:01,545
快走
Go!

499
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:50,343
你為什麼不告訴我？
Why didn't you tell me?

500
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:03,199
艾麗卡 艾比不要
- Elektra! - Abby, no!

501
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:05,861
讓我幫她
Let me go!

502
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:40,563
你就是能量之源是嗎？
Ah, you are the little treasure, aren't you?

503
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:43,703
戰爭要結束了
The war is over.

504
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,547
戰爭才剛剛開始
The war has just begun.

505
01:02:56,654 --> 01:02:58,815
退後，艾比
Move back, Abby.

506
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:06,088
她沒事的
She is safe.

507
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:08,722
後會有期，老人家
Another day, old man.

508
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:24,076
沒事了 你好好休息吧
You'll be fine. Rest now.

509
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:37,552
不要尋找你的敵人 要感應他在哪裡
Don't look foryour opponent. Know where he is.

510
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:43,355
雖然我瞎了，但我比你看到的更多 因為我不用眼睛尋找
I 'm blind, and I see more than any ofyou, because I don't look.

511
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:00,901
你沒有權利托我下水，斯蒂克
You had no right to drag me into this, Stick.

512
01:05:01,012 --> 01:05:02,912
所有和幻影殺手的戰爭 都是由她而起，是嗎？
This whole warwith the Hand, everything, it's all about her, isn't it?

513
01:05:03,014 --> 01:05:05,039
她是他們的能量之源
They call hertheTreasure.

514
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:09,449
她四五歲的時候就已經伸手不凡
She was aprodigy from fourorfiveyears old.

515
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:11,453
很快傳到了幻影殺手那裡
Wordgot aroundfast.

516
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:15,548
幻影想讓她助他們一臂之力 所以想偷她走
The Hand wanted her for themselves. They tried to steal her.

517
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,063
他爸爸又把她偷回來了 你現在又摻入這件事
- Her father spirited her away. - And you set this up-

518
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:23,930
原來都是你僱用我 和曼柯去殺他們的
The contract, McCabe, all of this- you hired me to kill them.

519
01:05:24,035 --> 01:05:26,526
是你自己選擇的
You're entitled toyour opinion.

520
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:29,572
一對父女，斯蒂克你居然利用我
A father and his daughter, Stick. You manipulated me.

521
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:33,474
我有嗎？
Did I?

522
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:35,909
這原來是一個測驗
Was all this a test?

523
01:05:36,013 --> 01:05:39,972
從你趕我出去那一天之後的事情 原來都是一個測驗
Everything from the day you threw me out, has it all been a test?

524
01:05:41,986 --> 01:05:44,250
如果我失敗會怎麼樣？
What ifl had failed?

525
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:48,324
有些東西不是教出來的，艾麗卡
Some lessons can't be taught, Elektra.

526
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:51,691
這個需要自己參透
They must be lived to be understood.

527
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,959
當你來的時候，你的內心充滿憤怒
When you came here, you were filled with anger.

528
01:05:55,066 --> 01:06:00,333
你的內心被 暴力和悲憤所侵蝕
All the decencyyou once had, poisoned byviolence and tragedy.

529
01:06:00,438 --> 01:06:03,532
這樣是無法達到的
This is not the way.

530
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,575
這樣是無法達到的
This is not ourway.

531
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:10,970
老人家你又在上課
You talk in riddles, old man.

532
01:06:11,082 --> 01:06:14,074
我想讓我的學生提高警惕性
It keeps my students alert.

533
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,780
我知道你的心一直是純真的
I always knew your heart was pure.

534
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:22,620
你要做的就是要超越自己
You simply needed to see it foryourself.

535
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,105
那艾比呢？
What about Abby?

536
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:38,767
克阮不死 她就不能離開這裡
As long as Kirigi is alive, she's only safe here.

537
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:41,845
她沒有選擇
She has no choice.

538
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:17,373
又偷偷跑到我屋來
Still breaking and entering I see.

539
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,383
對不起
Sorry.

540
01:07:21,485 --> 01:07:23,385
你需要它的 記得要勤加練習
You'll need it. Keep practicing.

541
01:07:27,324 --> 01:07:29,224
對不起我不該對你撒謊
I'm sorry I lied to you.

542
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:33,490
不用道歉 也沒有必要
Don't apologize. You did what you needed to do.

543
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:36,532
我不想對你撒謊的
I didn't wanna lie toyou.

544
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:39,865
我爸爸也不想的
Neither did my dad.

545
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:43,232
我一直很難過沒有告訴你
It made me sick not telling you.

546
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,433
每個人都在撒謊，艾比 沒有人不說謊的
Everybody lies, Abby. Nobody tells the truth about themselves.

547
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:47,374
包括你
Including you.

548
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:50,106
特別是我
Especially me.

549
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:53,342
解僱人，縮減工人薪水 就是那樣
- The layoffs and payroll reductions. - Like that.

550
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:55,442
恩，還有那個數數
And the, uh, the counting.

551
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:58,386
- 什麼？ - 數步數
- Sorry? - O.C.D.

552
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,684
我沒有數步數
I don't have O.C.D.

553
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,919
我小時候數過 但已經是很多年前的事情了
I had it when I was a kid, but I haven't done that in years.

554
01:08:04,028 --> 01:08:07,054
你剛才還在數 當你慢慢走的時候
You were just doing it. When you walk slow like that.

555
01:08:08,732 --> 01:08:11,758
那你在幹嗎？ 到底是不是在數？
What areyou doing? Areyou counting?

556
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,860
不要無禮
Don't mock me.

557
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:16,405
不管怎麼樣我還是你的長輩
I'm still your superior.

558
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,407
也許吧
Maybe.

559
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,737
非要跟我比試一下嗎？
Wanna find out?

560
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:38,559
我要去找我爸爸
I'm gonna go find my dad.

561
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:03,617
不要亂來
- [ Groans ] - Don't force it.

562
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:05,951
你再硬來
You're forcing it.

563
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:31,376
你很快比我更強
You'll be better than I am very soon.

564
01:09:35,886 --> 01:09:40,482
我只是一個小孩 我不想留在這裡
I'm just a kid. I don't wanna stay here.

565
01:11:10,014 --> 01:11:12,778
你想怎樣？
What do you want?

566
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:14,783
讓我們單獨來解決這件事情
To finish it, you and me.

567
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:18,582
我不需要斯蒂克幫忙，你不能讓你爸爸幫忙 贏者拿走一切
No help from Stick, no help from your father. Winner take all.

568
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:21,988
如果我殺了你 小孩子就是我們的
And when I kill you, the little one is ours.

569
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:25,493
你不會得逞的 她永遠是自由的
And whenyou don't, she is free forever.

570
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:28,224
同意嗎？ 同意
- Agreed? - Agreed.

571
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,733
那在老地方見
We will meet where it all began.

572
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:34,861
還要老地方結束我們的恩怨
And it will end where it all began.

573
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:36,872
至少我們做個了斷
Foryou, at least.

574
01:15:12,456 --> 01:15:15,016
聰明的孩子
Clever girl.

575
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:26,933
艾麗卡
[ Girl] Elektra!

576
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:30,700
怎麼了？ 有什麼問題嗎？
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

577
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:40,006
我們又見面了
[Kirigi] We meet again.

578
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:17,382
現在你會記起來
Nowyou'll remember.

579
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:15,237
放開她
[Abby] Let her go!

580
01:17:21,818 --> 01:17:24,048
勇敢的孩子 你調教的很好
Brave gi rl. You taught her well.

581
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:04,750
你需要一個新主人
But it's time for a new master.

582
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:22,309
這就是那個瞎子教的？
Is that what the blind man's been teachingyou?

583
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:32,988
還不夠 你要學會預見敵人
Not good enough. But you'll learn to anticipate your opponent.

584
01:19:00,484 --> 01:19:02,384
艾比 我不會丟下你的
- Abby- - I'm not leaving you.

585
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:05,148
不過你確實讓人擔心 就像你一樣
- You're a pain in the ass. -Just likeyou.

586
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:17,189
紋身，能量之源就在這裡
Tattoo, the Treasure's here.

587
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:53,701
跟緊我
Stay right behind me.

588
01:20:02,646 --> 01:20:04,773
跟緊點，艾比
Stay close, Abby.

589
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,288
艾麗卡
Elektra!

590
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:11,446
魔法耍的不錯 我以前領教過
Nice trick. I've seen it before.

591
01:21:28,765 --> 01:21:31,393
艾比，你在哪裡？
Abby, where are you?

592
01:21:33,637 --> 01:21:36,936
艾麗卡 可惜不是
- Elektra? - Not exactly.

593
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,650
我曾經是力量之源
You know, I used to be the Treasure...

594
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:57,989
我不喜歡被人代替
and I don't like being replaced.

595
01:21:58,094 --> 01:22:01,860
我們兩個只能活一個
So let's keep your death between you and me.

596
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:11,474
艾比
Abby!

597
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:13,339


598
01:23:48,838 --> 01:23:51,033
你不行了艾麗卡
You're slipping, Elektra.

599
01:23:51,141 --> 01:23:54,372
快點，踩水，踩水...
Come on, let's go. Push, push, push.

600
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,679
快點，踩水、踩水...
[Father] Let's go. Let's push, push, push, push!

601
01:24:00,016 --> 01:24:04,749
堅持住，艾麗卡 堅持住
- Keep going, Elektra. Keep going. - [Man ] Don't worry, Elektra.

602
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:06,845
我只是一個孩子 我會好好照顧她的
- I'm just a kid. - I'll take good care ofher.

603
01:24:06,956 --> 01:24:09,049
我不想待在這裡
I don't wanna stay here.

604
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:11,389
艾麗卡
Elektra.

605
01:24:13,997 --> 01:24:17,455
不要擔心，艾麗卡 我會好好照顧她的
Don't worry, Elektra. I'll take good care of her.

606
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,775
艾比
Abby.

607
01:25:33,877 --> 01:25:36,778
該死，快點
Damn it. Come on.

608
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:57,629
我再也不害怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

609
01:26:06,843 --> 01:26:09,334
艾比
Abby.

610
01:26:09,445 --> 01:26:12,505
艾比聽我說 聽我說
Abby, listen to me. Listen to me.

611
01:26:42,145 --> 01:26:44,045
我知道你的心一直是純潔的
[Stick's Voice ] I always knewyourheart was pure.

612
01:26:44,147 --> 01:26:48,880
但你要超越自己
You simplyneeded to see it foryourself.

613
01:27:09,172 --> 01:27:11,072
嗨，女戰士
Hey, warrior girl.

614
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:15,042
快點醒來
Come here.

615
01:27:15,144 --> 01:27:17,305
醒來，艾比
Come here, Abby.

616
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,079
我需要你 我剛剛找到你
I need you. I just found you.

617
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,913
我剛剛找到你
I just found you.

618
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:51,410
嗨
Hi.

619
01:28:27,116 --> 01:28:29,084
謝謝
Thankyou.

620
01:28:37,226 --> 01:28:38,955
對不起
Sorry.

621
01:28:39,062 --> 01:28:41,121
你真討厭
Yeah, I hated that.

622
01:29:21,437 --> 01:29:26,033
下一步準備幹什麼，克阮已經死了 沒有人追殺你了
So, what's next? Kirigi's gone. No one's afteryou.

623
01:29:28,044 --> 01:29:30,274
去上學？
Back to school?

624
01:29:31,781 --> 01:29:34,272
到海灘來個日光浴 還有冰激凌
- Go to the beach and get a tan. - And get ice cream.

625
01:29:34,383 --> 01:29:37,648
噢
[ Laughs ] Oh.

626
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:47,795
是你重新給我生命
You gave me my life back.

627
01:29:53,803 --> 01:29:55,862
是你讓我參悟我的人生
You gave me mine.

628
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:04,575
我還能再見到你嗎？
Will I seeyou again?

629
01:30:13,556 --> 01:30:15,649
我們會在意念內相會
We'll find each other.

630
01:30:53,596 --> 01:30:56,360
希望她不要走我的路
Please don't let her be like me.

631
01:30:56,465 --> 01:30:58,365
為什麼不？
Whynot?

632
01:30:58,467 --> 01:31:00,367
其實你還不錯
You didn't turn out so bad.

633
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,640
我不想看她太生活的太累
I don't want it to be so hard for her.

634
01:31:06,742 --> 01:31:09,040
這個要由她來決定
That's up to her.

635
01:31:12,248 --> 01:31:16,150
你復活的第二次生命 是不是跟原來的大所不同？
Anyway, your second life's never really likeyour first, is it?

636
01:31:16,252 --> 01:31:18,482
有時候...
Sometimes...

637
01:31:18,588 --> 01:31:20,488
比以前的生活更精彩
it's even better.
