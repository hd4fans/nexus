1
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,130
-Stay on the beacon!
-Manolo, we lost the beacon.

2
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,199
My God! My God!

3
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:20,328
-What's our heading?
-I don't know.

4
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,199
We lost all navigation.

5
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:25,266
-Pull the nose up!
-I can't!

6
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,860
Come on, pool is closed, everyone.
Out of the water.

7
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,628
Stow that gear and get out of here.

8
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:37,763
Get these divers out of the water.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, back here.

9
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:40,102
-Taking too long.
-Watch your step. Here you go.

10
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:42,939
-Assholes and elbows, that's all.
-You all right?

11
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:46,412
Where's that fat guy's weight belt?
That's coming out of your pay, Jared.

12
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,175
Would you shut up for two seconds?

13
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,820
If I wanted that kind of lip,
I'd drop my fly. Let's go.

14
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:53,855
What about my weight belt?
Those are 60 bucks a pop.

15
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,015
You want me to take that out
of your paycheck?

16
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,753
I'll tell you what, Bob.
I got him in, you get him out.

17
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:09,703
Here at the Atlantis, we have the
largest marine habitat in the world,

18
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:12,899
The nurse sharks in this habitat
grow up to 1 4 feet,,,

19
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,602
,,,and feed differently
than most other sharks,

20
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:19,180
They suck in their prey
with one poweful inhalation,,,

21
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,544
,,,and they swallow it
pretty much whole,

22
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,880
-Do you guys hear that?
-Yeah.

23
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,454
Did you ever get bit?

24
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:30,115
Yeah, Gina here got a little too frisky
with me one day last year.

25
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:34,424
But for the most part, shark attacks are
just a simple case of mistaken identity.

26
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,753
Hey, Boone.

27
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,023
What's your daddy up to?

28
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,482
-Hey.
-Hey.

29
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,219
-Smells good over there.
-What?

30
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:33,055
Smells good in there.

31
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:36,455
Yeah, that's my famous chili
and corn bread.

32
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,594
What?

33
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,824
Last time you made your chili
and corn bread...

34
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,400
...your ex-girlfriend was here.

35
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:48,632
Then, the time before that,
you brought home a pregnant...

36
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,933
...flea-infested, three-legged dog.

37
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:54,335
Last time a storm came through here,
like that last one....

38
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:56,342
Kam Jackson--
You remember Kam Jackson?

39
00:05:56,513 --> 00:06:00,074
Found that golden cross, remember,
on the north side of the island?

40
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,650
That hurricane that came through
moved so much sand...

41
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,811
...who knows how many
shipwrecks it uncovered?

42
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,752
So this is where
your chili comes in?

43
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,756
I'm saying I should be
out prospecting.

44
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,519
Quit your job?

45
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,959
No, I was fired,
but it's all part of the plan.

46
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:17,897
I'm just gonna get this thing going,
get the boat shaped up...

47
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:21,595
...make a big find, and we'll live
the rest of our lives on our own clock.

48
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,570
-I thought we already were.
-Yeah, but we'll be rich.

49
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:27,933
You okay?

50
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:31,579
Here, let me see.

51
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:37,176
I'm all right.

52
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,720
-Honey....
-Stinking boat.

53
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:43,723
You know I'd live on this
broken boat with you, right?

54
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:47,696
I love it when you say stuff like that.

55
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,477
Hey. Hey.

56
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,379
You guys okay?

57
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,980
Yeah.

58
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,348
Yeah, we're good, man.
Just plugging a few holes, you know?

59
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:14,817
-Sea Robin looks great.
-Yeah, we just finished it.

60
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,926
We got her out to sea
before the storm hit.

61
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:19,892
-We've been working every day since.
-What are you looking for?

62
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,928
They found the Titanic.
You didn't hear?

63
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,726
Oh, you mean the one
with the dishes?

64
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,132
No, I only hunt for stuff that comes
in gold and silver. You know that.

65
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:29,135
Hey, Sam.

66
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,369
Here.

67
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:37,446
Found it this morning
where we were blowing a site.

68
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:40,014
Maybe this guy can find a stone
to put in that thing.

69
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:43,516
Hey, I'm sorry about your boat.
You want my guy to take a look at it?

70
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,947
I think it's looking good.
Got it under control.

71
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:48,250
All right.
Well, the least I can do is offer.

72
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,620
Word on the water
is you're out of work.

73
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,785
You can always come back
and work for me.

74
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,521
No. I got my own thing going now.

75
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,192
But if you wanna subcontract me,
that's cool.

76
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,200
We can work something out.
Like a fifty-fifty thing, you know?

77
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:03,973
You don't just take a rowboat out and
find a treasure chest filled with gold.

78
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:07,133
It took me almost 1 0 years of scraping
till I found my first haul.

79
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,541
Hey, I mean what I say.

80
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,113
You need help getting back
in the water, let me know.

81
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,273
-Move it out.
-Hey, Quinn.

82
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,614
You wanna come work for a real
captain, you let me know, all right?

83
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,053
Are you a captain now? You know,
the water goes outside of the boat.

84
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,494
We'll see you, Sam.

85
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:58,988
You know I can't slave
for Bates again.

86
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,194
I know that.

87
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:05,531
There's no way I'm gonna
bust my ass while he gets rich.

88
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:07,567
Meanwhile, he's blasting holes
in the reef.

89
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:10,571
-I just don't operate that way.
-I know, honey.

90
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,073
I just want you to be happy, okay?

91
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,540
You know that.

92
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,179
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

93
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,545
Welcome to the Bahamas,
It's a pleasure having you here,

94
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,376
-Thank you.
-Welcome to paradise.

95
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,211
It's a pleasure having you here, sir.

96
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,876
It's a pleasure having me here too.
Thank you.

97
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,481
Business or pleasure?

98
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,785
Come on, bro, what do you think?

99
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,092
Enjoy your stay.

100
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,564
No way.

101
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:14,930
It's Mr. OG Wannabe.

102
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,335
What's up, you scruffy
little beach rat?

103
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,804
Okay.

104
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,901
I'm gonna throw your ass
right now. Watch.

105
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,381
-Go to sleep, go to sleep.
-Okay, okay.

106
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,406
All right.

107
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:29,718
You've been spending
too much time in court.

108
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:32,150
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Don't move for a second.

109
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,057
Oh, that feels really good.

110
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,015
You sick-ass.

111
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:38,855
-What's up?
-Good to see you.

112
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,554
-Good to see you too, bro.
-How's New York treating you?

113
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,564
It's paying me. A lot of bad guys
need defending, I defend them.

114
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:47,999
-That's what I do.
-That's still a scary thought.

115
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:50,867
Oh, my God. Can I get a what-what
and a side of french fries?

116
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,636
Look at that body.
It's ridiculous. Holy shit.

117
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,972
-How much have you missed me?
-Oh, every minute.

118
00:10:57,147 --> 00:11:00,913
Oh, my God, it's so tight too.
It's like that everywhere, even.

119
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,780
It's good to see you, Sam.
If we had met first, you and l...

120
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,013
...things would be a lot different,
you know.

121
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,952
Easy, cheesy.

122
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,026
Anyway. Okay, so you must be Lisa?

123
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:15,730
-Who's Lisa?
-Yeah, who the hell is Lisa?

124
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,629
Amanda, Amanda,

125
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,267
-Amanda.
-Hi, Amanda. I'm Sam.

126
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,736
-Welcome to the Bahamas.
-Hi. Nice to meet you, Sam.

127
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,238
-I'm Jared.
-Amanda.

128
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,876
-Sorry about that.
-Let's go. These guys are ridiculous.

129
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,672
-You're such an idiot.
-Decent save. You did good.

130
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,146
No, that was horrible.

131
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,716
I love the Caribbean.

132
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:38,411
Too hot to wear shirts,
too hot to wear pants...

133
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:41,056
...and we're two hot young ladies.

134
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,455
-You dive?
-Yeah, I can keep up.

135
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:47,119
So how long you known
this one for?

136
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,032
I don't know, about 1 4 hours now.

137
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,929
Picked her up last night
at The Mercer--

138
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,629
I picked you up last night.
Don't start lying already.

139
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:59,934
-So you and Bryce.
-I think I'm in love. Serious.

140
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,742
I'm not serious.

141
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:07,844
The guy who owned this place got hit
with 44 counts of racketeering...

142
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,509
...and money laundering.
Our firm represented him.

143
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,281
-This is how he floated the bill.
-You gotta be kidding me.

144
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:18,086
Boat problem? No problem.
Boat and skis come with the crib.

145
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,452
-We get the boat?
-You know how Daddy does it.

146
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,222
-We get the boat?
-We get the boat.

147
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,924
We get the boat! We get the boat!

148
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,427
-Let's see it, bro, come on.
-Oh, my gosh.

149
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,571
There he goes.

150
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,580
How you like me now?

151
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,378
That was so hot.

152
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,000
-How sick was that?
-That was amazing.

153
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,828
-Where are we?
-It's our secret spot.

154
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,793
Amazing, isn't it?

155
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:58,346
Shark, dude. Get out of the water.
There's a shark.

156
00:14:58,555 --> 00:14:59,920
Come on.

157
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:01,722
Jared, get out. It's a shark.

158
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,217
Come on, swim. Swim to me,
swim to me, Jared, swim to me.

159
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,454
Get out, get out.
Come on, come on, get out.

160
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,861
What are you laughing at? Get out.
There are sharks everywhere, look.

161
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,729
Give me my mask
and my fins real quick.

162
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,235
You-- No, you don't need a mask.
There's a shark. He looks like Jaws.

163
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,031
-Get out.
-Yeah, but I lost my watch.

164
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,142
You lost--?
You need an arm to wear a watch.

165
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,005
Would you get out
of the water, stupid?

166
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:24,806
-Sam gave me it for my birthday.
-I don't care. Sam, get--

167
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,074
-What are you doing?
-They're just curious.

168
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,912
Curious as to what? As to what?
What his ass tastes like?

169
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,987
Dude, get out. Seri--
Oh, my God, look at that. That shark.

170
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:36,182
-Hold on. Hold.
-Sam, what is he doing?

171
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:38,585
Right there, right there.

172
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,360
You cool?

173
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:45,131
Don't do that.
Come on, don't do that.

174
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,767
-It's not funny?
-No.

175
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,361
Look. Look what I found.

176
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,571
No way. That's a rock, honey.

177
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,300
Three-minute breath-hold
and the guy comes up with a rock.

178
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,573
I mean, what are the odds of that?
Wait till I tell the boys at the office.

179
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,908
No, that's a ballast stone, man.

180
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,244
Ships used to carry them
in their hull.

181
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:12,678
Wow, right.
Well, I got a box of Cohibas...

182
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:16,917
...and some rum from back in the day
over on the land part of Earth. Let's....

183
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,720
Let's handle it over there,
you know?

184
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:21,830
He always finds these things.
It's the ship that's always missing.

185
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:25,058
Help me out. Let's get back in
the water before the sun goes down.

186
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,294
Really? You think there's
something down there?

187
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,835
I don't know. Grab your stuff.

188
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,165
Hold on. Are you insane?

189
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,366
You think I'm going back in there
with those things? I'm mad at you.

190
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:36,171
They're not aggressive.
It's tiger sharks you should avoid.

191
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,974
Yeah, she's right.
Those tiger sharks are bad news.

192
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:42,049
Those are the ones that are furry
and have the stripes on them.

193
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,880
That was a joke.
He's funny now, this guy. Okay.

194
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:47,045
Yeah, no,
I'm not getting in the water.

195
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,891
It's gold, right?

196
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,489
You find something?

197
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,414
Yeah.

198
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,995
-What?
-A plane.

199
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,523
Like an airplane?

200
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,031
Yeah, like an airplane.

201
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:54,327
Well, that's odd.

202
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:43,335
How many of these
do you think are down there?

203
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:46,037
I don't know, enough bricks
to build a house.

204
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:49,275
A multimillion-dollar
cocaine palace.

205
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:54,623
With a pool and a waterfall and
a giraffe nibbling on the front yard.

206
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,190
How about a prison cell
with no sunlight for 1 0 years?

207
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:06,765
Yeah, we're out of here.

208
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,163
Jared, what about this?

209
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,909
-What-y-what-what?
-Come on, Amanda, don't be stupid.

210
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:17,637
-Oh, we're not gonna get caught.
-You're right, we're not.

211
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:19,440
Come on. It's for us.
Come on, relax.

212
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,446
-I am.
-We'll save it for a rainy day.

213
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,380
-Or a rainy month.
-Come on, seriously.

214
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,577
-Maybe a sunny day?
-Let me see it real quick.

215
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,189
Hey, Sam. Come here.
Hey. Wait, wait.

216
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:30,451
Come here, come here.
Sam, Sam, stop.

217
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,790
Let's just let the defense present
its case for a second.

218
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,555
-All right.
-I don't do drugs.

219
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:37,096
-I hate drugs.
-Sure.

220
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:40,667
But throwing this away, I don't know.
Maybe I object. Silly, right?

221
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,565
Throwing it away,
doesn't it seem silly?

222
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,132
Throwing it in the--
In the ocean?

223
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,866
-Trash?
-Wait, let me see this.

224
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:49,807
I think, you know, it would be--
What are you doing?

225
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:51,913
It's going away.

226
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,877
-Really?
-Yeah.

227
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,483
Wow, that's intense.

228
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,487
That's a new boat, Jared.

229
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,418
That's a new b--
Threw away a new boat. Okay.

230
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:07,460
-We're out of here.
-Threw a new boat into the ocean.

231
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,330
You guys are a lot of fun.

232
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:13,299
You're gonna keep this,
though, right?

233
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:15,767
Yep. Jackass.

234
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:17,166
Okay, good.

235
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:22,702
What do you think, Jared? You think
there's more treasure down there?

236
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:27,310
-Big storms bring big treasure.
-Oh, good. What does that mean?

237
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:32,017
What she's saying is that hurricanes
like the one that came through here...

238
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:35,214
...sometimes what they do is they sift
stuff out that's been buried.

239
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,324
Good, so we go back tomorrow
and we dig.

240
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:40,621
Not if we report that plane crash.

241
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,491
The place will turn
into a crime scene.

242
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:46,101
Coast Guard, DEA. They'll be all over
it and we'll never get near it again.

243
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:48,429
What happened to
"finders keepers, losers weepers"?

244
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,663
The law down here
doesn't play by those rules.

245
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:53,633
See, the thing of it is,
you have to file a claim.

246
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,403
In order to file a claim,
you have to identify the wreck.

247
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,243
We have to be able to name
what it was and where it came from.

248
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,211
So like I keep saying, we go down
tomorrow and we dig and we find out.

249
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,583
-What about the plane?
-What about the plane?

250
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:10,692
We found bodies. Don't you think
we should tell someone?

251
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,689
They're drug dealers, Sam.
They're not missionaries...

252
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,730
...flying care packages
to starving kids in Africa. Okay?

253
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:19,231
Don't worry. Their girlfriends
will have new pimps...

254
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:21,996
...before the milk in the refrigerator
goes bad. It's fine.

255
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,705
Don't you think somebody
wants their lost luggage?

256
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,865
I'm sure that they do,
I'm sure that they do.

257
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,443
All the more reason we need to
keep our mouths closed.

258
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:33,272
Yeah, because, you know,
loose lips, they sink ships.

259
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,777
That's right, baby.
Loose lips do sink ships.

260
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:40,149
Now, look, what we do is we go down,
we identify the wreck...

261
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:42,813
...and then we call in the plane.

262
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:46,359
Right? Unless-- Unless you don't have
a problem with somebody else...

263
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,793
...Iaying claim on your treasure.

264
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:52,859
These aren't like those shipwrecks
you have at the bottom of a fish tank.

265
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:56,903
I mean, it could be spread
all over the ocean floor.

266
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,007
She's right.

267
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:03,905
But, Sam, I really think
we can do this.

268
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:07,738
And the equipment we need
and don't have?

269
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,884
That's where Mr. Deep Pockets
comes in.

270
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:12,452
-Right?
-That's right.

271
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,316
The Kid.

272
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:19,586
The bottom line is we could
spend the rest of our lives...

273
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:22,526
...waiting for another
opportunity like this.

274
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,098
-All right.
-What?

275
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,137
-All right.
-Come on, excitement, a little bit.

276
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,332
-Can we have some fun--?
-Under one condition.

277
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,534
-Fine.
-We report that plane...

278
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:37,872
...as soon as we can
make a claim...

279
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,811
...and we stay the hell away
from it until then.

280
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,646
Don't look at me.

281
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:47,150
Come on, guys. I'll just stay here
and suck on my thumb...

282
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:49,188
...while you play
Pirates of the Caribbean.

283
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,651
All right, one more thing, though.

284
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,193
Not a word to anyone.

285
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:56,956
Okay?

286
00:27:57,466 --> 00:28:00,367
Got it, got it, got it. We're good.
Can we drink to this, please?

287
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,795
-We're gonna be rich, people.
-Cheers, big ears.

288
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,534
-Cheers.
-Cheers to being loaded.

289
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,807
Check it out, though,
I need a-- I need a compressor...

290
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,008
...air lifts, four sets of AGA gear,
hookah rigs.

291
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:17,880
-You got all that?
-Ain't no thing.

292
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:20,954
No? What about a boat that's
already dialed in with electronics?

293
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:23,489
-Not a problem.
-Please don't put me on hold.

294
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,060
I need a magnetometer,
I need a side scan sonar.

295
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:29,356
I can set you up with
that whole boat over there.

296
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,830
Sonar, blower,
the whole ball of wax, man.

297
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,798
But you gotta pay.

298
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:35,630
-How much?
-Thirty grand.

299
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:39,331
Hello? Hello? Are you there?

300
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,537
What's he doing?
He's tripping me out.

301
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,838
No, he's the bank. He's putting
together the funds. Thirty grand?

302
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,709
Thirty grand.
I'll give you two weeks.

303
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:51,177
I'll carry the note.
You do good, you get the toys.

304
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,412
What do you mean, a meeting?
He's a criminal.

305
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,489
Criminals don't have meetings.

306
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,421
-Look, no, don't hang--
-What's up?

307
00:28:57,593 --> 00:29:00,994
I can't believe this guy. The nerve.
I cannot understand it.

308
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,063
I basically saved this guy's life.

309
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:05,200
Ten years at Leavenworth,
and I get him off.

310
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:07,801
He can't float me
a couple thousand dollars.

311
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,460
So, what are you saying?

312
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:11,799
You don't have any money?
You're tapped out?

313
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,943
-Dude, I told you about Vegas.
-But you told me it was no big deal.

314
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,806
-You told me it wasn't a problem.
-I lied. Yeah.

315
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,676
-I lied. I got a pride problem.
-Why didn't you tell me that?

316
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:23,147
Tell you what? What do you
wanna hear, my sob story?

317
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,879
Here it is, Jared. I borrowed money
from the wrong people.

318
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,819
I took out a loan
and now I'm really weighed down.

319
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:31,425
Yeah, you should've told me
you didn't have any money.

320
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:32,925
You gonna float my marker?

321
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:36,121
You gonna cash in
all your Subway stamps?

322
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,962
I'm just--

323
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,700
Why didn't you tell me, bro?

324
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,997
Why did we come here
if you don't have any money?

325
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:46,102
Wasting our time.

326
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,106
This is bullshit.

327
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,009
Bye.

328
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,007
Hey, it's me.

329
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:59,245
I got some info that might kick you
in the balls and make you cough.

330
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,796
Yo, check this out.

331
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:04,996
-Look.
-Where's Amanda?

332
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:07,005
-She's with you.
-Give me your tank.

333
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:08,643
-What's going on?
-Give me a tank.

334
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,142
She's not with you?

335
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:12,303
-Give me that tank. Come on.
-Jesus Christ.

336
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,812
-Come on.
-Tank, tank, tank.

337
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,768
-What are you doing in here?
-What do you think I'm doing?

338
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:15,868
I was looking for your stupid ship.

339
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:19,946
I turned around, and you disappeared.
So I came in here looking for you.

340
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:25,414
-What?
-I told you to stay away from the plane.

341
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:27,914
I didn't take anything.

342
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:32,852
You wanna search me?
Here, go ahead.

343
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:37,293
We're out of here.

344
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:46,706
Salt water converts silver
into silver sulfide...

345
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,241
...and electrolytic reduction
reverses the process.

346
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:52,437
Whatever, bro. Just hurry up
and turn it back into treasure.

347
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:59,515
It's an old cap-and-ball.
That's a old-school gun right there.

348
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:02,816
-Let me see that.
-See the hammer, the trigger?

349
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:05,459
What is this--? These markings?

350
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:07,527
Give it to the Mexican.
What does that say?

351
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:09,357
You're such an ass.

352
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:11,593
-That's not Spanish.
-Let me see it.

353
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,395
Oh, it's Latin. "Sic semper tyrannis."

354
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,433
"Thus always a tyrant."

355
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:23,836
What? Catholic boarding school.

356
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:26,207
So, what, it's a Roman ship?

357
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:28,679
Seventeenth-century lndian dagger?
I don't think so.

358
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,779
No, this is an American ship.

359
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,178
Here it is, right here.

360
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:36,290
"Sic semper tyrannis:.
thus ever to tyrants."

361
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,551
You were close.
"The motto of Virginia...

362
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,025
...said to have been shouted
by John Wilkes Booth...

363
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:45,257
...after he had assassinated
Abraham Lincoln in 1 865."

364
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,959
Jared. Check this out.

365
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,597
Doesn't that look like a map
of New Providence?

366
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,173
-That's this island, right?
-Yeah.

367
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:57,277
Silver powder horn.

368
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,575
-Silver horn and two silver guns.
-What?

369
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,877
"Later they confirmed it was
the slave-pirate...

370
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:06,885
...by the silver horn and two
silver guns he was never without."

371
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:08,784
And this was his, right here.

372
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:10,356
-Whose?
-Tillman Thorp's.

373
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,688
-The runaway slave turned pirate.
-He was crazy. He ran the Everglades.

374
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,727
He and his crew were gnarly.
They ate alligators, drank lead...

375
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:20,356
...pissed musket balls, gave the
Confederates hell. It was like revenge.

376
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:21,729
He just worked them.

377
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:27,873
So this is Snoop Dogg Silver.

378
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:30,170
These are the homies
over here, chilling.

379
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,210
-Look at that guy drinking a 40.
-Chilling?

380
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:33,678
Chilling. Yeah.

381
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:35,248
So, what do you think we got?

382
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:39,148
Some Confederate flags and old
Skynyrd tapes down there or what?

383
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:43,018
No, I don't think we found his ship.
I think we found the Zephyr.

384
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,056
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

385
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:48,227
The Zephyrwas a clipper ship
owned by this wealthy...

386
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:52,060
...French trader, lived in New Orleans.
The war broke out, and he freaked out.

387
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:54,327
He takes his ship, family,
throws them onboard.

388
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,438
His antiques, valuables, gold, silver,
whatever he's got, onboard.

389
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,267
They try to make a beeline
for France.

390
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:04,276
Okay, but Mr. Two Guns and a Horn
here screws up his itinerary, right?

391
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:07,506
The ship wasn't all he took. He also
took the Frenchman's daughter.

392
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,016
-He kidnapped her?
-No. She ran away with him.

393
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:13,416
Long after the ship was sunk...

394
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,886
...they were spotted living together
in Eleuthera.

395
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:17,992
Oh, my God, this is a fairy tale.

396
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,889
They knew the French
would catch up...

397
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:23,395
...so they sunk the ship
to throw them off their trail.

398
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:27,092
Right. Gave up the gold for a girl.

399
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:29,931
Stop kissing.
First of all, it's disgusting.

400
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:34,701
Stop kissing. No self-respecting pirate
would do that, okay?

401
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,334
That's ridiculous.
Ten-to-one, this guy got so deep...

402
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:42,244
...into that fine,
white, French "poo-needy"--

403
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,113
-"Needy"?
-"Needada," that he took his eyes...

404
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:47,915
...off the road and crashed,
splash, right into a rock.

405
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,421
-Guys.
-That's what happened.

406
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,456
-This is my new Romeo, right here.
-It's reality.

407
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,152
I really don't care what happened.

408
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,355
The bottom line is,
the Zephyr's down there.

409
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:59,090
And if we found it...

410
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:02,828
...we have hit the mother lode
of mother lodes.

411
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:06,701
What kind of mother lode are we
talking about here? For real. Reality.

412
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,807
Tens of millions.

413
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,273
In 1 861.

414
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:18,847
-Sounds like hundreds of millions.
-More.

415
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,544
That's insane.

416
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:22,485
Okay, this is the hook, though.

417
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:24,625
If we want it to be ours,
clean and clear...

418
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:27,023
...Iike, legal, no ifs, ands or buts...

419
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:30,722
...we have to come up with something
that says "the Zephyr" on it. Anything.

420
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:33,333
No, no.
What we need to do...

421
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,296
...is figure out what thousands
of millions divided by four equals.

422
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:39,463
That's what we need to figure out.

423
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,508
-God, it's so crazy.
-I can't imagine.

424
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,880
Hey, Amanda,
you're gonna stay topside.

425
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,949
Why?

426
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:01,658
Because you need to keep
an eye open for visitors.

427
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,094
-Well, I still get my cut, right?
-Of course, baby.

428
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:05,528
We're all equal partners.

429
00:39:07,102 --> 00:39:11,471
All right. I'll stay up here
and I will work on my tan.

430
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,707
Tie on.

431
00:41:27,175 --> 00:41:29,143
Everything okay out here?

432
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,336
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You sure?

433
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:34,175
Yeah, you know, just trying
to even out my naughty bits.

434
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:38,010
Can you cover yourself up, miss?

435
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,879
Sure.

436
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,302
Do you have any drugs
or weapons onboard?

437
00:41:57,472 --> 00:41:59,770
-No, I don't.
-This is Bahamian water.

438
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:01,533
We have the right
to search the boat.

439
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:11,710
Sir, I found something.

440
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:15,112
Looks like prescription drugs to me.

441
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,183
Are these yours?

442
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:22,653
No, they're not mine.

443
00:43:56,825 --> 00:43:58,019
What's your name, miss?

444
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:01,018
Amanda.

445
00:44:44,305 --> 00:44:45,772
Yo, is everything cool?

446
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,801
-Jared?
-Hey.

447
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:51,977
Yeah, everything is cool.
I didn't recognize the boat.

448
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:53,803
Yeah, it's a friend of mine's.

449
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,213
-Hey, Sam, how you doing?
-Hey, Roy.

450
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,448
Good.

451
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:02,920
-How's Allison and Emily?
-They're good, good.

452
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,956
All right, guys, wrap it up.

453
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:06,718
Roy, this is my friend, Bryce.

454
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,521
-Hey, Bryce.
-How you doing?

455
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,894
-That's Amanda up there.
-We met. How you doing?

456
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:15,194
What happened
to your friend's arm?

457
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,862
Oh, I just-- Got a little too close
to the fire coral.

458
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:21,174
Better wrap that up good.

459
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,372
Why didn't you have
a "diver down" flag?

460
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,343
Yeah, I know, I just--
I got lazy, man, you know.

461
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:29,642
There's not a lot of boat traffic
out here, just a bunch of jellyfish.

462
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:32,684
And drug traffickers.
Flying their planes in from Colombia...

463
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:35,414
...dropping loads in the water.
You know. Boat like this--

464
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,388
We just saw a shark fin and,
I don't know, I couldn't resist.

465
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,960
Wanted to show these mainlanders
a real shark.

466
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,427
-Yeah.
-Didn't really think too much about it.

467
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:45,896
-Right. Nice.
-Yeah.

468
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,729
Came a little too close.
I almost pissed in my Speedo.

469
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:52,498
You crazy. If I saw a shark...

470
00:45:52,674 --> 00:45:55,268
...I'd be like Jesus of Nazareth
and run across that water.

471
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:57,206
You hear what I'm saying?

472
00:45:57,378 --> 00:45:59,346
All right, brother. All right, girl.

473
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:01,311
-Can't wait to see the girls.
-All right.

474
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,178
Take care of that arm.

475
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,519
-I will.
-See you, Roy.

476
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:10,715
-All right, guys, let's go.
-Bye, guys. Have a good day.

477
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,685
Bye. Bye, boys. Thanks.

478
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:36,409
If everything pans out correctly,
we're gonna be doing a fifty-fifty split.

479
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:38,609
That's half for me,
and half for you and Sam.

480
00:46:38,786 --> 00:46:41,949
-Well, what do you mean?
-Don't say it. Do not say it.

481
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:45,991
Amanda? Not family. You, l? Family.
Amanda, not family.

482
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,855
-You'd cu--? You'd cut her out?
-Yeah.

483
00:46:48,029 --> 00:46:50,725
-Guaranteed, she's telling everyone.
-She's gonna talk?

484
00:46:50,898 --> 00:46:52,627
-Yeah.
-No, if she talks, we'll--

485
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,065
We'll have her in the Special Olympics
next year. She's not gonna talk.

486
00:46:56,237 --> 00:46:57,795
Guys.

487
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:01,431
Let's go. Now. Come on.

488
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,100
-What?
-Protect my ass. Come on.

489
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,569
-Hey. I gotta go cool off.
-What?

490
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:48,452
-Hey, Jared.
-Hey, what's up, Danny?

491
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:51,057
Listen, some pointy-looking dreads
been asking for you.

492
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:52,692
It was freaking me out a little.

493
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,886
They was all up in my mouth, like,
you know, "Where you been diving?

494
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:58,931
-Who you been hanging out with?"
-What did you tell them?

495
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,264
I didn't say shit. I don't know nothing.
I got your back, dog. Trust me on that.

496
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:07,630
But they don't look like they
from around here, that's for sure.

497
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:11,702
Yeah, well, I appreciate
the heads up. Thanks.

498
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:14,143
-Everything cool?
-Yeah.

499
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:17,182
Yeah, everything's cool. Thanks,
though, Danny. I appreciate it.

500
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:20,279
Wet white guy coming through.

501
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:24,014
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

502
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:26,920
Where's Amanda?

503
00:48:27,095 --> 00:48:28,392
I don't know.

504
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:31,164
No?

505
00:48:58,493 --> 00:49:00,893
Hey, my man. My man.

506
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:03,263
My man. Girl's with me.

507
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:05,160
Just talking to the lady, my boy.

508
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,733
-I'm just telling you she's with me.
-Baby, it's cool.

509
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:10,735
-What's cool?
-This is Primo. He owns this joint.

510
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:13,373
-What's up, my man?
-No, we're good, bro. We're good.

511
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:15,743
-Great.
-Come on.

512
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,004
Hey, you wanna--?
You wanna do a little--? Little bump?

513
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:21,411
Yeah, yeah, let's do a bump.

514
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:24,642
That shit's for losers.
You know what I mean? Let's go.

515
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,412
Ask her how she was
gonna pay for it.

516
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:30,955
-How she was gonna pay for it?
-Yeah. Ask how she was gonna pay.

517
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,984
Here, hold this.

518
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:35,722
Hey, hey.

519
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:41,632
Oh, shit.

520
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,770
Watch out. Watch out.
Get out of the way.

521
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:45,132
Get out of the way!

522
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:52,769
Hey.

523
00:49:53,548 --> 00:49:54,981
Hey, cut it out.

524
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:58,018
-Talk to your boy, Jared.
-Primo--

525
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:00,086
-Talk to your boy.
-Come on.

526
00:50:00,254 --> 00:50:02,586
-Chill out.
-You're a bitch.

527
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:04,384
-Don't.
-I'll murder you, boy.

528
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,831
-Jared, this just sucks.
-What's your problem, Bryce?

529
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:14,160
-I ain't got a problem.
-What's your problem?

530
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:16,200
What are you looking at?

531
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:18,334
He's not the guy to pick a fight with.

532
00:50:18,506 --> 00:50:20,804
-I didn't pick a fight.
-No, he didn't pick a fight.

533
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,909
-I didn't do it.
-He just punched the guy.

534
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:25,170
-Shut up. Shut up.
-You're awesome. Real tough.

535
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:28,315
You know what, you shut up.
And don't screw this up.

536
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,213
Okay, I'm so-- I'm sorry, okay?

537
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:35,082
-I'm sorry. I apologize.
-All set, let's go, come on.

538
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:38,279
Come on.

539
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:18,625
You all right? You all right?

540
00:52:18,826 --> 00:52:22,455
All right, let's go, let's go.
Get the heck out of here, man.

541
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:32,705
Mother flip.
My jaw must be broken.

542
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,672
What the hell was that all about?

543
00:52:41,782 --> 00:52:45,445
Okay, let's gather around here.
You wanna stay away from the ropes.

544
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,487
-Now, you guys know what these are?
-No.

545
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:50,283
They're called "mailboxes."

546
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:56,454
Hit it.

547
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,859
Now, watch this.

548
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:02,033
We use the mailboxes to deflect
the prop wash, right?

549
00:53:02,203 --> 00:53:06,970
To blow away sand and debris
so we can find sunken ships.

550
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:10,167
All right? Now-- Hey.
Oh, my God, what is that?

551
00:53:10,344 --> 00:53:12,312
-What is that?
-It's a pirate.

552
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,970
-It's a pirate.
-It's a pirate.

553
00:53:14,148 --> 00:53:16,139
-What does he have?
-Treasure.

554
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:18,148
Treasure.

555
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,718
There we go.

556
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,547
Yeah, enough chocolate
for everybody.

557
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:26,454
Like I told you,
I'm not a treasure hunter, I'm a...?

558
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:29,926
-Treasure finder.
-Finder! Yeah.

559
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:32,759
-Bye, pirates.
-Bye.

560
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:37,501
-Bye. Thank you.
-Hey, absolutely. It was a blast.

561
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,368
-I hope you guys come back.
-Thank you.

562
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:43,808
-See you guys later.
-Bye.

563
00:53:43,978 --> 00:53:45,206
Have fun back at school.

564
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:49,674
Hey, Jared. What's up, man?

565
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,513
The Bonzel was that wreck
you found off Mysterioso Bank.

566
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,417
-What's going on, captain?
-Don't know.

567
00:53:57,024 --> 00:54:00,585
Jared here found a hat. Seems pretty
excited about it, you know?

568
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:04,424
I don't normally buy back
old souvenirs I sell, but, you know...

569
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:06,828
...if you need the dough
and, you know....

570
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:08,593
Just tell your boys to back off.

571
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,232
My boys?

572
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:14,863
-You boys been bothering this man?
-No, sir, captain.

573
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:17,704
I got over 1 00 people that worked
for me on the Bonzel.

574
00:54:17,878 --> 00:54:20,142
I sold a shitload of hats...

575
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:22,908
...so this could belong to anybody.

576
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:27,151
Just stay away from us, okay?

577
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:31,115
Look, you're the one who boarded
my boat without permission.

578
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:34,489
You realize people still get shot
for that down here?

579
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:40,663
Time and money, Jared.

580
00:54:40,835 --> 00:54:44,999
That's what it takes to bring stuff up
from the bottom of the sea. I got both.

581
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,098
What do you got?

582
00:54:47,274 --> 00:54:50,334
Borrowed time and a borrowed dime?
That must suck.

583
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:55,006
All right, you take care.

584
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:58,345
Drive safe.

585
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:08,822
Do you realize it's just a matter of time
until Bates finds that wreck.

586
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:11,556
Meantime, we're crawling around
the bottom of the ocean...

587
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:13,893
...digging for treasure
with spoons, man.

588
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:16,332
Yeah, and I know...

589
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:20,128
...where to get the money
to get the stuff that we need...

590
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:23,401
...only I can't go down
and get it by myself.

591
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:26,677
No, we've already talked
about that.

592
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,115
But what are we talking about?

593
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:31,808
What are we talking about?
We're not talking about a lot.

594
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:34,784
We're talking about just enough
to get what we need.

595
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:40,952
Look at me right now in my face and
tell me you haven't thought about it.

596
00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:43,957
Well, you know I've thought about it.

597
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:47,100
But have you thought about
the penalties here for drug trafficking?

598
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:49,736
-I know what they are.
-They throw you under the prison.

599
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:51,428
Nope. Nope. Maximum--

600
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:54,096
Maximum first-time offense
for trafficking, Jared?

601
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:56,835
You know what it is? Five years.
Five years, Jared.

602
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:59,741
It took me longer to get through
law school and pass the bar.

603
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:01,142
-Only five years, huh?
-Yeah.

604
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:03,909
Man, you wouldn't last five days
in Fox Hill Prison.

605
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:06,018
You know what, man?
We're risking our lives.

606
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:08,052
We're risking our lives
every single day...

607
00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:10,816
...Iooking for a 1 50-year-old ship
that might be buried...

608
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:14,893
...under the bottom of the ocean,
while 1 00 million, easy...

609
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:17,326
...easy, sits in a plane
200 yards away.

610
00:56:18,132 --> 00:56:20,362
We could get that money we need
to get that boat.

611
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:23,833
And what do we do? Keep swimming
on by it like it doesn't even exist.

612
00:56:24,004 --> 00:56:25,699
Tell me what's crazy.

613
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:28,033
Jesus Chri--
Jared, I've dealt with these people.

614
00:56:28,209 --> 00:56:29,733
I defended these people.

615
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,901
These people who move
tons of this shit.

616
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,947
They're not gifted people, Jared.
This is not rocket science.

617
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:40,010
-And I'm not a drug dealer.
-No. You are not a drug dealer.

618
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,218
You're a 29-year-old dive bum.

619
00:56:43,257 --> 00:56:44,781
You are.

620
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:48,122
I'm serious, man. What's so funny?
You live in a trailer.

621
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:50,690
You got a boat on blocks.

622
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:54,130
Okay? And you got 50 bucks
to your name on a good day.

623
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,769
I mean, come on. Well, Sam-- Sam.

624
00:56:56,937 --> 00:57:00,338
How long you think a girl like Sam
will stick around if you don't fix that?

625
00:57:00,507 --> 00:57:02,498
-Sam is not like that.
-They're all like that.

626
00:57:02,676 --> 00:57:04,610
-Sam isn't.
-Okay.

627
00:57:04,778 --> 00:57:05,938
Look, I love you to death.

628
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,604
The whole flip-flop-and-board-short
thing is cute now...

629
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:11,580
...but what about when you're
the old man sitting at the bar...

630
00:57:11,752 --> 00:57:13,743
...and nothing in your pocket
but sand...

631
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:16,913
...and you're drooling and you're
going on and on about how you--

632
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:19,150
You were the one
who found the Zephyr.

633
00:57:19,326 --> 00:57:22,762
It was you until Bates came along...

634
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:27,492
...and he stole that shit right from
under you. You gonna be that guy?

635
00:57:30,104 --> 00:57:31,435
You know what, Jared? Winners.

636
00:57:31,605 --> 00:57:35,302
Winners make the rules,
and losers live by them.

637
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,737
What are we talk--?
It's a one-time thing, man.

638
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:43,282
It's a one-time thing.
Means to an end.

639
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,179
That's all it is.

640
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,690
Where are you going?

641
00:57:55,229 --> 00:57:57,993
What, the conversation's
done now, Jared?

642
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:02,094
Jared?

643
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:12,806
He didn't go for it.

644
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,441
You wanna keep tricking
or you wanna start pimping?

645
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,419
I think it matters.

646
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:27,321
What matters?

647
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:28,961
The legend.

648
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:31,654
About the pirate and the girl.

649
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:36,361
I think it matters that he gave up
the treasure for love.

650
00:58:37,705 --> 00:58:40,538
-You do?
-Sure.

651
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:43,142
Don't let Bryce hear you say that.

652
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:46,212
What about you?

653
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,874
Would you give up treasure
for love?

654
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:58,419
Like it's even a question.

655
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,363
-I'd definitely take the treasure.
-You're an ass. You would.

656
00:59:06,533 --> 00:59:09,093
-No way. No way.
-Yes, you would.

657
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:12,097
We have a good life. A great one.

658
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:15,567
You should ask yourself
what's missing in your life...

659
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:17,870
...that money will get you.

660
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:37,093
All right, hit it.

661
00:59:52,744 --> 00:59:55,975
-We good?
-Hold on. Hold on. Now.

662
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:55,563
Hey, guys.

663
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:57,431
How's it going?

664
01:00:58,843 --> 01:01:02,108
Like shit.
What you gonna do about it?

665
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:05,141
I have a feeling I'm gonna
make it all better, baby.

666
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:09,275
Winning. Winning. What's that, bro?

667
01:01:10,355 --> 01:01:11,879
What you gonna do?

668
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:14,252
What'd you do if I sock you
in your face, homeboy?

669
01:01:14,426 --> 01:01:16,417
What if I sock you--?
What if I sock you in--?

670
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:18,892
What if I sock you
right in your head?

671
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:23,159
Yeah. No, no.
We're good, right? It's all good?

672
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:25,063
What's that?
You want the one-two-three?

673
01:01:25,236 --> 01:01:27,568
One-two-three?
What are you gonna do, bro?

674
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,510
Get out of the car, Opie.

675
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,117
What?

676
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:42,879
-I gotta go, man.
-You gotta go?

677
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:45,818
I gotta go to work. My baby mama
harassing me for a new weave.

678
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,150
All right, see you, Danny.

679
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:49,589
-I'll see you later, all right?
-Yeah.

680
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,305
-Yeah?
-Hey, What's up, bro? It's me,

681
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:11,710
Hey, what's going on?

682
01:02:11,883 --> 01:02:14,852
-Can you meet me somewhere now?
-Yeah, where at?

683
01:02:26,865 --> 01:02:27,923
Now, stop that.

684
01:02:33,972 --> 01:02:35,496
Hey, what's up?

685
01:02:52,357 --> 01:02:53,722
This him?

686
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:55,757
Yeah. He's a local. I know him.

687
01:02:57,262 --> 01:02:58,627
He's okay.

688
01:02:59,497 --> 01:03:01,931
-What's going on?
-You tell me.

689
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,507
Here's the deal. Don't give me
that look. Everything's fine.

690
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:14,042
It's fine. It's fine.
These guys-- Everything's cool.

691
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:16,146
They thought I was Babylon,
I'm clearly not.

692
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,578
So everything's good now,
right, brothers? Right?

693
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,513
Come on. Hey, come on.

694
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,781
Mr. Nobody, from nowhere,
tried to crash my party...

695
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:25,889
...without an invitation.

696
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:29,623
I need someone to vouch for him
before we nail his coffin shut.

697
01:03:32,096 --> 01:03:33,461
You found my plane, didn't you?

698
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,759
Okay, now, you see that?
Look, let-- Do we have a deal or not?

699
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:38,459
Because I mean, it's--

700
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:40,393
No, we don't.

701
01:03:41,906 --> 01:03:44,932
So what's--? I mean, F you.
Is there a problem?

702
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:46,440
-ls there a problem?
-Yeah.

703
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:51,105
You sound like you work in retail.
Yes, there is a problem.

704
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:04,152
It takes balls, stealing my cocaine
and trying to sell it back to me.

705
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:06,627
Your cocaine. Okay.
That's something we didn't know.

706
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:08,732
-Now, listen up. Listen up.
-I swear on my--

707
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:12,267
I don't care how my stuff
found its way back to me.

708
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:15,235
I just want it back. All of it.

709
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:21,643
-That is all of it.
-No, this stuff don't come in six-packs.

710
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:23,872
Well, that's all we found.

711
01:04:26,684 --> 01:04:28,311
That's all we found.

712
01:04:37,695 --> 01:04:39,287
There is 800 kilos in that plane...

713
01:04:39,464 --> 01:04:42,365
...and I want every brick of it
in 1 2 hours' time.

714
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:47,702
Primo tells me the ocean
is your soccer field.

715
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:51,397
Me, I never leave this boat.

716
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,909
So this is how it's gonna be.

717
01:04:55,747 --> 01:04:59,308
You are gonna swim back down
to the octopus's garden...

718
01:04:59,484 --> 01:05:03,545
...get the rest of it and bring it to me.
Then we'll talk numbers.

719
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:07,516
There's a lot of boats buzzing around
out there, looking for my plane.

720
01:05:07,692 --> 01:05:11,355
If you get caught
and you give them my name...

721
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,288
...I'm gonna come after those
you love most.

722
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,294
Okay?

723
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,738
No, it's not okay.

724
01:05:29,514 --> 01:05:30,981
Did you say something?

725
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,812
We don't have the equipment
we need to haul the rest up...

726
01:05:34,986 --> 01:05:36,613
...and it's gonna cost...

727
01:05:37,322 --> 01:05:40,689
...30,000, nonrefundable,
to get the rest of it.

728
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,863
Give him the money.

729
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:59,442
You have 1 2 hours.

730
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:03,179
Spend it wisely.

731
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,594
-That was intense.
-Hey, hey.

732
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,294
Hey. Okay.

733
01:06:27,472 --> 01:06:30,930
-I can't believe you.
-Okay. All right.

734
01:06:32,243 --> 01:06:34,370
You put everyone's life in jeopardy.

735
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:36,376
What's wrong with you?

736
01:06:36,948 --> 01:06:39,712
I don't understand. I don't
understand what the problem is.

737
01:06:39,884 --> 01:06:42,250
We go down there,
we go down in that wreck...

738
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,854
...we bring up some coke,
we deal with these morons...

739
01:06:45,022 --> 01:06:47,650
...and then in a month
we're on the Discovery Channel...

740
01:06:47,825 --> 01:06:50,385
...up to our knees in treasure,
smiling, like this.

741
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:52,620
What's the problem?

742
01:06:57,135 --> 01:06:59,126
It better be that simple.

743
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:02,732
And if anything happens to Sam,
I swear I'm gonna kill you.

744
01:07:07,145 --> 01:07:08,806
Come on.

745
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:15,480
Sam, it's all good. This helps.
This is not a problem.

746
01:07:15,653 --> 01:07:17,382
Jared hooked it up. It's all good.

747
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:21,457
I told you she wouldn't be into it.
She's so clean, she squeaks.

748
01:07:21,626 --> 01:07:23,685
-Shut up, you coke whore.
-Sam.

749
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:26,261
-Very nice.
-Amanda, stop. All right?

750
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:30,128
-We're all in this together now, right?
-Not me. Not anymore.

751
01:07:30,735 --> 01:07:32,930
-Bye.
-Sam.

752
01:07:33,104 --> 01:07:34,731
Hey, Sam.

753
01:07:35,773 --> 01:07:37,707
-Sam.
-See you on the 1 0:.00 news.

754
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,775
-What?
-You heard me.

755
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:42,777
-Sam, come on, what are you doing?
-What is wrong with you?

756
01:07:42,947 --> 01:07:45,711
A week ago you had too much integrity
to work for Scuba Bob...

757
01:07:45,883 --> 01:07:48,181
...and now you're working
for frigging drug dealers?

758
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:50,543
Yeah, but....

759
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:55,752
I believe in you more than
in the prospect of any treasure.

760
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:01,764
If we do this just this one time...

761
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,068
...we salvage the Zephyr
and it's over. That's it.

762
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:11,303
It's already over.

763
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,576
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

764
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:19,145
Sam, come on.

765
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:30,694
Sam, come on.

766
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:43,403
-Yeah, you ready, Bryce?
-All right, hit it, Jared.

767
01:08:57,255 --> 01:08:59,849
Turn it off. Turn it--

768
01:09:01,993 --> 01:09:03,290
Hey, Bryce, you okay?

769
01:09:03,461 --> 01:09:07,124
Let me get the sand out of my ass
and I'll tell you exactly how I am.

770
01:09:08,266 --> 01:09:09,961
You see anything?

771
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:11,900
Bryce, you hear me?

772
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:14,060
I see something.

773
01:09:14,438 --> 01:09:17,236
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going. Yes, yes, yes.

774
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,966
Keep it going.

775
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:23,310
Bingo, baby.

776
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:29,149
Cut it, cut it, cut it.

777
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,981
Bryce, how are we doing?

778
01:09:31,155 --> 01:09:32,884
Come down, come down.

779
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:44,129
Baby, here we come.

780
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:47,471
Yes, yes.

781
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:50,766
Oh, my God, look at this.

782
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:54,241
Let's go find the gold,
the G-old.

783
01:10:01,218 --> 01:10:03,516
Blow, baby, blow.

784
01:10:07,892 --> 01:10:09,189
All right, now suck.

785
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:29,777
-Hey, over here.
-What? What is it?

786
01:10:29,947 --> 01:10:32,415
You got gold? What?

787
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:41,819
Hell, no.

788
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:45,958
What's that say? What's that say?
Read that shit, bitch.

789
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,621
Look at that. What's that say?

790
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,000
Zephyr. Zephyr. Zephyr.

791
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,503
That's what we need,
the name on something, right?

792
01:10:57,775 --> 01:11:00,437
That's it right there, baby,
that's the claim and the fame.

793
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:02,374
Now let's go find the gold
and get paid.

794
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,844
Where's the cheddar? The golden
cheddar? The old-gay eddar-chay?

795
01:11:09,587 --> 01:11:13,546
Jared, where are you going? We need
to find the cheddar cheese, the gold.

796
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:29,531
Amanda, come here, come here.

797
01:11:29,707 --> 01:11:32,904
Look at-- Look at the P. Diddy juice.

798
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:36,206
1 853. Good year.

799
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,109
Keep it crispy. Pop the top.

800
01:11:39,784 --> 01:11:42,480
I can't take this mask off.

801
01:11:42,653 --> 01:11:45,952
-Let's go upstairs. Come on.
-Whatever.

802
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:49,956
Would you give up treasure
for love?

803
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,595
Would you give up treasure
for love?

804
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:56,296
I love you.

805
01:12:10,548 --> 01:12:12,209
Give me the bags.

806
01:12:14,685 --> 01:12:17,882
Hey. Hey, Chico, get the yeyo, man.

807
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:21,081
I've never seen so much yeyo
in my life.

808
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:23,883
Lots of cheese.
Look at all the cheese.

809
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:25,585
Come on, let's just get this done.

810
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:30,267
-Take it to the line.
-It's heavier than I thought it would be.

811
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:43,479
All right, I need another bag.

812
01:12:50,054 --> 01:12:54,081
Listen, I'm gonna bring up this load
and the bell. Keep filling the bags.

813
01:13:38,102 --> 01:13:39,660
Bryce, I need another one, come on.

814
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,169
Here you go.

815
01:14:21,512 --> 01:14:24,640
Jesus Christ, Shit, Jared!

816
01:14:25,282 --> 01:14:26,874
Hey, Bryce, come back.

817
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:33,354
-Jared!
-Oh, no.

818
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:38,921
What? What's wrong?

819
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:43,362
-Jared. Jared, you gotta--
-Oh, no. Oh, no, what happened?

820
01:14:43,534 --> 01:14:45,195
Take off her BC.

821
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:50,073
Help me out.
Get her on the boat.

822
01:14:57,648 --> 01:14:58,945
Turn her over.

823
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:00,447
Oh, dear God.

824
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:03,781
Oh, shit. We're getting
out of here, come on.

825
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,193
Was she a certified diver?

826
01:15:45,095 --> 01:15:46,790
You know, I don't know.

827
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:49,091
What about yourself?
Are you a certified diver?

828
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:53,430
Look, ma'am-- Ma'am, I'm a lawyer.

829
01:16:01,245 --> 01:16:02,507
I'm sorry.

830
01:16:03,047 --> 01:16:07,074
I'm just glad you're okay. I love you.

831
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:12,917
We gotta get back down there
and get it.

832
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,218
-It's down there, just waiting for us.
-Shut up, Bryce.

833
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:18,861
Why don't you shut up, Sam.
Why don't you shut up, okay?

834
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:20,792
-You put us through all this.
-Would you--?

835
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:23,490
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you. Get it?

836
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,636
Yes, I got it. Great.
Now we're here, so let's go.

837
01:16:26,804 --> 01:16:29,364
The quicker we go down there
and get them off our backs...

838
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,235
...the quicker we can get
our treasure.

839
01:16:31,775 --> 01:16:34,972
Amanda's dead, and you're
still thinking about treasure.

840
01:16:35,412 --> 01:16:38,813
I've known her for five days.
Five days.

841
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:40,416
You are such an asshole.

842
01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:44,111
Why am I an asshole?
What do you want me to do, Sam?

843
01:16:44,288 --> 01:16:47,189
You want me to wear an armband?
Go into mourning? Plan a funeral?

844
01:16:47,358 --> 01:16:50,418
I'm a terrible person. That's what it is.
I'm a terrible person, Sam.

845
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:52,152
-Yeah.
-You got it?

846
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:53,990
-Who is it?
-You got the product?

847
01:16:54,164 --> 01:16:57,292
-Wait, who is it?
-Man, we ran into some complications.

848
01:16:57,468 --> 01:16:59,561
-You got it or not?
-No.

849
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:02,836
Then we have a problem,
Scuba-Doo,

850
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,698
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

851
01:17:05,943 --> 01:17:07,672
-He's got a gun.
-Go, go, go.

852
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:11,977
Go, Jared. Watch those kids.

853
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,777
Make a right, make a right.

854
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:21,520
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

855
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:25,219
-Come on, Jared. Jared.
-I'm going for it.

856
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:29,595
-Jared.
-Oh, shit.

857
01:17:30,034 --> 01:17:31,058
Shit.

858
01:17:36,507 --> 01:17:39,704
-You okay?
-Jared? Jared?

859
01:17:39,877 --> 01:17:41,970
-Jared, he's coming.
-Jared?

860
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:44,910
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-Jared, here he comes. Get in the car.

861
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:47,573
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna take him out.

862
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,811
-Jared?
-Yo, he's gonna hit the car. Back up.

863
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:53,479
-Back up, man.
-I'm going, I'm going.

864
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:57,187
-You'll hit my car. What you doing?
-Jesus' sake.

865
01:17:58,996 --> 01:18:00,588
I got it, I got it.

866
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,997
Get him. The man move.

867
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,270
Oh, man.

868
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:15,937
-What are you doing?
-Go to Shoreline Cove. I'll meet you.

869
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:17,410
-Jared--
-Sam, you drive.

870
01:18:17,581 --> 01:18:21,039
-No. Jar-- It's not safe.
-Bro, don't be a hero. Be a coward.

871
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:23,778
-Be a coward, get in the car.
-Drive. I need you to drive.

872
01:18:23,954 --> 01:18:25,945
-Sam, get in the car.
-What are you gonna do?

873
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:31,254
I'll meet up with you. Bryce, you drive.
I'll see you there. I'll be okay. Drive.

874
01:18:31,428 --> 01:18:35,262
No. No-- Fuck.

875
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:45,172
This boy a madman.
Him a madman here.

876
01:18:47,444 --> 01:18:50,311
-Sam, where is this place?
-Right up here.

877
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:52,448
All right, slow down.

878
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:56,846
Where you going?

879
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,079
This is what we should've done
a long time ago.

880
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:07,355
-Hey.
-Oh, what are you doing?

881
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,165
What's going on? Where you been?
Where's Jared?

882
01:19:13,036 --> 01:19:15,596
-Can we talk for a minute?
-What's going on?

883
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:22,039
Stupid. So stupid.

884
01:19:22,212 --> 01:19:24,976
Go. Just go. Just go.

885
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,645
Sorry, Sam.

886
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,374
-Here you go.
-What this?

887
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:58,572
This is from a sunken ship
full of treasure.

888
01:19:58,749 --> 01:20:02,082
Easily worth 1 0 times more
than your boss's coke.

889
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:07,019
And you guys can have all of it,
if you forget you ever met us.

890
01:20:09,193 --> 01:20:11,058
Let's see if we can make a deal.

891
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:17,065
This is serious, Sam.

892
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,798
If I go to the wrong person
with this, right?

893
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:24,700
I got the chief of police in my
back yard right now. We're coworkers.

894
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:26,900
And I don't even know
if I can trust them.

895
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:32,947
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

896
01:20:33,116 --> 01:20:37,450
I just-- l-- I didn't know
who else to go to.

897
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:40,618
Let me make a call.

898
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:44,255
I might know somebody
who may be able to help.

899
01:20:45,329 --> 01:20:46,796
Okay?

900
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:12,880
Get down.

901
01:21:13,557 --> 01:21:15,149
Memo.

902
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:09,269
Well, I see you've met
my business partner.

903
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:15,207
You have something
that belongs to me, Jared?

904
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:38,764
No, don't shoot.

905
01:23:44,641 --> 01:23:47,474
There he is. Use the solid.
Go get him.

906
01:24:49,873 --> 01:24:52,865
Man, this boy, he gotta be
around here somewhere.

907
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,478
See him over there, mate?

908
01:25:31,615 --> 01:25:32,877
What it is, man.

909
01:25:41,024 --> 01:25:43,424
No sign of him yet, boss.
Brother's got skills.

910
01:25:43,593 --> 01:25:45,857
Forget about him,
Get back to the boat,

911
01:25:52,536 --> 01:25:54,367
-Everything's gonna be all right.
-What about Jared?

912
01:25:54,538 --> 01:26:00,340
Oh, Jared, he'll be okay.
Trust me, Reyes is done. Over.

913
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,569
He won't be a problem anymore
for anyone.

914
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:04,475
Thank you, Roy.

915
01:26:04,648 --> 01:26:07,412
You don't have to thank me, Sam.
This is the guy right here.

916
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:13,050
Bates?

917
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:30,700
Hey, Bryce.

918
01:26:32,075 --> 01:26:34,202
-Where's Sam?
-What the hell happened to you?

919
01:26:34,377 --> 01:26:37,540
-The hell with that. Where's Sam at?
-She went to-- To the cops, bro.

920
01:26:37,714 --> 01:26:41,115
She went to Roy. I couldn't stop her.
She just jumped right out of the car.

921
01:26:41,284 --> 01:26:43,514
-Give me your phone.
-Why? What's up?

922
01:26:43,687 --> 01:26:45,780
-I'm gonna call Sam.
-What's going on?

923
01:26:45,956 --> 01:26:47,651
Reyes and Primo are dead.

924
01:26:47,824 --> 01:26:49,451
Bates killed them.

925
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,617
What do you mean,
Bates killed them?

926
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,285
Reyes and Bates were partners.

927
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:56,864
We found their lost coke, and Reyes
tried to cut Bates out of the deal.

928
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,296
So Bates doesn't look
for treasure, really.

929
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,769
No, he's been looking for his plane,
been moving drugs this whole time.

930
01:27:09,846 --> 01:27:12,440
-Hello,
-Hey, who's this?

931
01:27:12,616 --> 01:27:15,517
Jared, Hi, Listen,
I just wanted to say,,,

932
01:27:15,685 --> 01:27:18,552
,,,that I am really, really sorry
about all this,

933
01:27:18,722 --> 01:27:21,282
Your girlfriend says she doesn't
know where my plane is,

934
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:23,688
Either she's a good liar
or she likes pain.

935
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,522
Not sure. You know her better
than I do. What do you think?

936
01:27:26,896 --> 01:27:28,955
Hey, Derek, why don't you
just let her go.

937
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:32,530
Well, you tell me where my plane is
and she walks.

938
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:35,470
-Let me talk to her for a minute.
-I would,

939
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:40,975
I would let you talk to her right now,
but she's got this thing in her mouth.

940
01:27:43,213 --> 01:27:45,340
Look, you want me to show you
where your coke is?

941
01:27:45,515 --> 01:27:49,747
No, no, no. Not show, Jared. Tell.

942
01:27:49,986 --> 01:27:53,319
You give me the coordinates right now
and Sam walks off this boat.

943
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:55,355
No, I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna go,

944
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:56,958
This isn't a partnership, Jared,

945
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:59,391
No, that's exactly what this is.
Fifty-fifty.

946
01:27:59,562 --> 01:28:04,090
If you want your coke, meet me
three klicks due south of Easter Point.

947
01:28:04,267 --> 01:28:07,532
All right. I will see you there.

948
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:08,898
Oh, and Jared...

949
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,999
,,,you saw what happened to the
last partner who tried to screw me,

950
01:28:21,117 --> 01:28:23,915
Remember when I said if anything
happened to Sam, I'd kill you?

951
01:28:24,087 --> 01:28:26,578
Oh, don't do that.
Don't hit me with the fucking chair.

952
01:28:35,865 --> 01:28:38,834
You told me this would be easy.
This would be a one-time thing.

953
01:28:39,002 --> 01:28:42,733
Yeah. Okay, it didn't go the way
I planned it. All right? It went wrong.

954
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:44,396
Yeah, this was all wrong.

955
01:28:47,277 --> 01:28:50,440
If I didn't have such a sweet tooth...

956
01:28:54,384 --> 01:28:58,514
...I would kill you. Right now.

957
01:28:58,688 --> 01:29:00,349
Bates.

958
01:29:02,525 --> 01:29:04,152
Yes, Roy?

959
01:29:08,298 --> 01:29:11,165
-What?
-You got what you wanted, right?

960
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:15,398
She's had enough.

961
01:29:16,172 --> 01:29:17,799
I see.

962
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:21,769
You're the one
who was right on top of it...

963
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:24,038
...when you stopped them
the other day, right?

964
01:29:24,214 --> 01:29:26,341
And you're the one
that didn't log the location.

965
01:29:26,516 --> 01:29:30,782
-Was that you?
-I told you it didn't merit the attention.

966
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:32,854
I believe them.

967
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:34,784
They're friends of mine.

968
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:45,793
They are friends of mine too.

969
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,801
I'm not the one who put the gun
to your head.

970
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:57,504
Did I make you settle with those guys
for that extra cash? Did I do that?

971
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,740
Oh, no, you did. You were there,
Jared, too, just like me.

972
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:04,717
Your eyes were spinning.
Gold bars. Same as mine. No?

973
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:10,918
I'm sorry, Jared.

974
01:30:12,428 --> 01:30:14,362
I screwed up.

975
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:18,760
Man, I screwed up.

976
01:30:19,836 --> 01:30:21,804
I was the one that screwed up.

977
01:30:26,509 --> 01:30:28,909
Bates know I'm still here?

978
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:44,187
Hey, Danny, we need a favor.

979
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,386
Jared? Bryce?
What are y'all doing here?

980
01:30:47,564 --> 01:30:49,896
-Come on, help me tie on.
-Oh, yeah, man, no problem.

981
01:30:57,774 --> 01:30:58,900
There he comes.

982
01:31:11,688 --> 01:31:13,519
Sam!

983
01:31:14,757 --> 01:31:17,419
All right. She's job security.

984
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,593
Now, if you want her to live,
you take me to my plane...

985
01:31:20,797 --> 01:31:23,698
...you dive with us.
It'll be like old times.

986
01:31:23,867 --> 01:31:25,926
Let her go and I'll sweeten the deal.

987
01:31:26,102 --> 01:31:31,267
Sweet--? With what? That shipwreck
in your back yard? What, your dog?

988
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:33,341
You have nothing to give me, Jared.

989
01:31:33,509 --> 01:31:35,443
-I found the Zephyr.
-What?

990
01:31:35,612 --> 01:31:37,603
And I'll let you have the claim.

991
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,374
I brought you here to save her life,
not to get her killed.

992
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,814
-Hundreds of millions...
-The Zephyr doesn't exist.

993
01:31:42,986 --> 01:31:45,887
...it's all yours, if you want.
If you let Sam go. It does exist.

994
01:31:46,055 --> 01:31:47,647
-It's not a myth.
-It's not a myth?

995
01:31:47,824 --> 01:31:49,621
-You want it? Then let her go.
-Okay.

996
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:52,454
Then let her go right now.
Sam, let's go. We're out of here.

997
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:53,926
-Go.
-Let her go.

998
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:56,657
Sam, he gave up the gold
and they got away.

999
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:00,865
He found the Zephyr.

1000
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:05,302
Maybe we'll meet up
in Never-Never Land...

1001
01:32:05,475 --> 01:32:08,672
...because I heard the tooth fairy
was gonna be there.

1002
01:32:09,545 --> 01:32:13,447
Santa Claus is coming, you know,
with my coke.

1003
01:32:30,733 --> 01:32:32,792
So how long you been
a drug trafficker?

1004
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:35,765
I'm a salvor, Jared,
the same as I've always been.

1005
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:38,066
But investors don't like it
when you come back...

1006
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:40,971
...to shore with nothing
but empty fuel tanks and a sunburn.

1007
01:32:41,678 --> 01:32:44,169
-All right, is this it?
-Throttle down.

1008
01:32:44,948 --> 01:32:46,677
Throttle down.

1009
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:51,046
Why did you have to put me
in this situation, Jared?

1010
01:32:52,021 --> 01:32:55,252
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with you and Sam now?

1011
01:32:55,425 --> 01:32:57,290
Pay us a finder's fee.

1012
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:00,554
Yeah, see, now you sound like
a man who has a future.

1013
01:33:01,864 --> 01:33:05,061
The way I see it, Bates, you're the one
whose days are numbered.

1014
01:33:05,735 --> 01:33:08,966
You got this big ship and crew,
all this fancy gear...

1015
01:33:09,138 --> 01:33:11,766
...and you couldn't even find
your own plane.

1016
01:33:12,141 --> 01:33:13,165
That must suck.

1017
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:38,926
Hey, captain,
there's something up ahead.

1018
01:33:39,635 --> 01:33:42,160
Do you see it?
Right up there, 2 o'clock.

1019
01:33:43,272 --> 01:33:45,263
Raolo, slow down, man.

1020
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,343
Right here, captain.

1021
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:56,715
Now who's the treasure finder?

1022
01:33:57,253 --> 01:34:00,313
-What the hell is this, Jared?
-That's half your coke, captain.

1023
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:02,651
Now I'm gonna go down
and destroy the rest of it.

1024
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:14,601
Suit up!

1025
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:49,489
Hey, crane's out. I'm going below.

1026
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:04,307
Shit.

1027
01:36:05,948 --> 01:36:08,007
No. No, no, no.

1028
01:36:09,152 --> 01:36:10,141
No.

1029
01:36:31,107 --> 01:36:33,871
Oh, Lordy, Lordy. Hey, hey.
Oh, today's your lucky day.

1030
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:38,344
Hey, boss, just the man I want to see.
You see how big this baby is?

1031
01:36:38,514 --> 01:36:40,539
-What you saying?
-We got divers in the water.

1032
01:36:40,716 --> 01:36:43,014
What divers, man?
I is the only diver out here.

1033
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:34,167
Come on, you and the wife
can grill this up tonight.

1034
01:37:34,337 --> 01:37:36,305
I say leave. Now.

1035
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:53,912
Do you copy?

1036
01:38:51,414 --> 01:38:55,111
Patrol, Message for
patrol boat five, Over,

1037
01:38:55,284 --> 01:38:57,309
This is patrol boat five, Control,,,,

1038
01:39:35,291 --> 01:39:37,191
Come here. Come here.

1039
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:50,632
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Sea Robin.

1040
01:39:50,806 --> 01:39:52,603
Twenty-five--

1041
01:40:05,721 --> 01:40:08,019
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1042
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:10,819
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1043
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:36,847
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position,

1044
01:40:38,087 --> 01:40:40,248
Sea Robin, do you copy?

1045
01:40:41,424 --> 01:40:43,858
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position,

1046
01:42:57,293 --> 01:42:59,158
Jared!

1047
01:43:50,212 --> 01:43:52,077
Hey, Boone.

1048
01:43:52,247 --> 01:43:54,681
-All right, we're good to go.
-ls it all bueno?

1049
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:56,181
Go ahead, bring it up.

1050
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:07,492
Here it comes.

1051
01:44:09,465 --> 01:44:11,228
A little bit more.

1052
01:44:12,601 --> 01:44:15,195
Up, up. All right, there we go.

1053
01:44:17,539 --> 01:44:20,064
-Jared?
-That's all right. Keep going.

1054
01:44:22,978 --> 01:44:24,605
A little more, Bryce.

1055
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,715
Why?

1056
01:44:45,634 --> 01:44:49,229
-Oh, well. Let's come back tomorrow.
-What do you mean?

1057
01:44:53,108 --> 01:44:55,508
I got everything I need right here.

1058
01:45:20,569 --> 01:45:23,504
-Bryce?
-What the hell?

1059
01:45:23,772 --> 01:45:26,366
-What's he doing?
-What a jagoff.

1060
