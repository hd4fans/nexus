1
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,959
- 先生，你好  - 里面好像漏油
- Yes, sir.  - l got a little grease in this lining.

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,088
检查大概要半小时，需要顺便加油吗？
lt'll take a half-hour to check it. You want me to fill her up, too?

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,007
- 也帮我检查一下机油  - 没问题
- You better check the oil, too.  - Yes, sir.

4
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,221
- 你们刚好经过这里？  - 对
- You boys just passing through?  - Yeah.

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,224
要去还是要离开匹兹堡？
Pittsburgh? Coming in or going out?

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:02,145
- 要去那里参加业务大会  - 你们是卖什么的？
- Going in, to a sales convention tomorrow.  - What do you guys sell?

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,065
卖药材，他再过不久就要得奖了
We sell drug supplies. He is going to get an award.

8
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,239
光是上个月，他就卖了一万七千元，算是这一区的超级业务
He sold $17,000 worth last month. Fastest boy in the territory.

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,241
超级无敌厉害
Yeah. Fastest and the ''bestest.''

10
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,161
- 我们再喝一杯吧  - 谢了
- Another round, one for him and yourself.  - Thanks.

11
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,415
今天这种天气开车真够热
Sure is a hot day for driving.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,461
下午会比较凉爽，你们现在可以休息一下
Late afternoon is better. You have plenty of time.

13
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,756
应该两三小时就可到达匹兹堡了
You can make Pittsburgh in two or three hours.

14
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,092
没错
He's right.

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,347
查理，怎样？
What do you say, Charlie?

16
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,350
打打撞球，过一会儿再上路
Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?

17
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,269
又要花钱了，每次都会
lt'll cost you money. Always does.

18
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,480
不要再浪费时间了，去拿你的球杆吧
Come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,483
幸好他还负担得起
Good thing he can afford it.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,154
再给我们一点酒
Keep them coming. J.T.S. Brown.

21
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,386
你没进球，又输了
You miss again, you lose again.

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,267
他欠多少？
What is the kid in hock for so far?

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,269
大概60、70块
About $60, $70.

24
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,230
下一局我们赌10块
Next game, $10.

25
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,778
长得很帅，看起来也很体面，可惜不会控制酒量
Nice looking boy, clean-cut. lt's too bad he can't hold his liquor.

26
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:01,056
我赢了！我终于赢了！快点把钱拿来吧！
l made it, boy! l finally made it! Come on, pay up, pay up, sucker!

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,768
你现在手气这么好，应该去掷骰子
You ought to shoot craps with that luck!

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,397
- 什么手气好？  - 你少装傻
- What do you mean, luck?  - You know what l mean.

29
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,109
你下次绝对不可能手气又这么好
You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.

30
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,406
不可能？我们再来试一次
l couldn't? Okay, set them up the way they were before.

31
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,159
- 干嘛？  - 放回去刚才的位置
- Why?  - Set them up the way they were before.

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,539
我跟你赌20块，一定跟刚才一样准
l'll bet you $20 that l make that shot the same way again.

33
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,126
手气再好的人也不可能会赢
Nobody can make that shot, not even a lucky lush.

34
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,803
怎样？
How is that?

35
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,766
- 是不是跟刚才一样？  - 对
- ls that the way they were before?  - Yeah, that's it.

36
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,685
再来
Come on, put it up.

37
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,374
我们再来一次
Set them up again.

38
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,463
来吧，再来一次
Come on, set them up again.

39
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,799
你喝醉了，小子，我不想再跟你赌
You're drunk, boy. l'm not betting you anymore.

40
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,676
什么意思？
What do you mean?

41
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,681
走吧，我们明天早上还要去参加大会
Let's leave. We have to be at that convention in the morning.

42
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:30,187
去他的大会！我准备好要赌了
Up the flagpole with the convention! Come on, l got my money on the table.

43
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,856
- 我不想再赌  - 我跟你赌
- l don't want it.  - l'll try you.

44
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,911
别这么蠢，不要再赌了
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot!

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,291
你应该知道我现在又醉又神智不清
You figure l'm a little drunk, l'm loaded on hemp...

46
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,879
要不要趁现在赶快下赌？
...and you just want in real friendly while the money's still floating?

47
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,716
好
Okay.

48
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,096
快准备一下
Go ahead. Set them up.

49
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:22,364
想要赚外快？给你105块，刚好是一周的红利
You want some easy money? Here's $105. One week's commission.

50
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,744
想要赌整局？那你还有可能把钱赢回来
You want to take the whole thing? Then you get a crack at your easy money.

51
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,038
- 我要下赌  - 我也要
- l'll take a piece of that action.  - Me, too.

52
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,542
- 不，我要他！  - 我去收银机拿钱
- No, l want him!  - l'll take it out of the till.

53
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,213
笨蛋，我到车上等你
l'll meet you in the car, chump!

54
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:13,106
片名：江湖浪子

55
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,349
巴黎餐厅

56
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:38,792
撞球场

57
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
亨利，早安
'Morning, Henry.

58
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,019
还真冷清
Quiet.

59
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,399
就像教堂一样
Yeah, like a church.

60
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,073
老油条教堂
The Church of the Good Hustler.

61
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:57,120
看起来还比较像太平间，那些赌桌就像停尸台
lt looks like a morgue to me. Those tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.

62
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,875
安啦，我们一定会赢
l'll be alive when l get out.

63
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,309
- 可以开哪一台？  - 都可以
- Any table?  - Any table.

64
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,191
酒吧没开？
No bar?

65
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:31,112
没有酒吧、没有弹珠台，也没有保龄球道，只有撞球台
No bar, no pinball machines, no bowling alleys, just pool. Nothing else.

66
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
先生，这里是艾拇斯
This is Ames, mister.

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
“先生，这里是艾拇斯”
''This is Ames, mister.''

68
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,743
真漂亮
Nice, clean pocket-drop.

69
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,890
我今晚要赢多少？
How much am l going to win tonight?

70
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,942
我今晚要赢一万块
$10,000. l'm going to win $10,000 in one night.

71
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,116
谁会打败我？
Who's going to beat me?

72
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,454
查理，拜托，谁会打败我？
Come on, Charlie. Who's going to beat me?

73
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,416
没有人能打败你
Okay, nobody can beat you.

74
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,046
一万块！
$10,000!

75
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:17,969
哪有人可能在撞球场一晚赚一万？
What other poolroom is there where a guy can win $10,000 in one night?

76
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,851
我记得以前跟一个老头对打，赌注也不过一角
l can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.

77
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,646
- 我们有对手了  - 想要比赛吗？
- We got company.  - Are you looking for action?

78
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,734
- 看情形，想打吗？  - 才不要
- Maybe. Want to play?  - No, hell, no.

79
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,820
- 你是艾迪富森？  - 他是谁？
- Are you Eddie Felson?  - Who's he?

80
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,033
- 你打得怎样？打什么球？  - 随便你，我都奉陪
- What's your game? What do you shoot?  - You name it, we shoot it.

81
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,951
我可不是什么老油条
Friend, l'm not trying to hustle.

82
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,748
我从不在撞球场随便跟别人挑战，所以你也别烦我
l never hustle people that bring in leather satchels. Don't hustle me.

83
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,881
我是艾迪富森，喜欢打基本撞球，有人能陪我玩一场吗？
l'm Eddie Felson. l shoot straight pool. Got any straight pool shooters here?

84
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,843
- 你喜欢哪一种基本撞球？  - 昂贵的那一种
- What straight pool game do you like?  - The expensive kind.

85
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,555
你想跟明尼苏达肥子对打？
You came to play pool with Minnesota Fats?

86
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,892
对
That's right.

87
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,022
- 想要听我的忠告吗？  - 需要付钱吗？
- Want some free advice?  - How much will it cost?

88
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,567
你是他的朋友还是经纪人？
Who are you, his manager, friend, his stooge?

89
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,486
他是我的伙伴
He's my partner.

90
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,114
- 有钱的伙伴？  - 少耍嘴皮
- Well-heeled partner?  - We got enough.

91
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,078
你们还是回家吧，肥子不需要钱，更何况你绝对不可能赢他
Take the boy home. Fats doesn't need your money. You can't beat him.

92
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,207
这15年来，没有人打败过他，他是全国最高杆的好手
No one's beaten him in 15 years. He's the best in the country.

93
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,794
你搞错了，我才是最厉害的
You got that wrong, mister. l am.

94
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:39,258
我已经警告过你肥子有多厉害，你要坚持的话，随便
Okay, l told you about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.

95
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,552
告诉我他在哪里
Tell me where l can find him, friend.

96
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,181
他每晚八点都会到这家撞球场
He comes in this poolroom every night at 8:00 on the nose.

97
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,517
他会来找你的
Stay here, he'll find you.

98
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:35,106
禁止赌博

99
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,066
- 你真厉害  - 谢谢
- You shoot a good stick.  - Thank you.

100
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,987
- 你也打撞球吗？  - 偶尔会打一下
- Do you shoot straight pool, mister?  - Now and then, you know how it is.

101
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,077
你就是明尼苏达肥子吧？
You're Minnesota Fats, aren't you?

102
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,958
听说你是全国最厉害的高手
They say you're the best in the country, where l come from.

103
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,587
- 真的吗？  - 真的
ls that a fact?

104
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,549
大家都说肥子出手必胜
They say that old Fats shoots the eyes off them balls.

105
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,720
- 你打哪来？  - 加州奥克兰
- Where are you from?  - California. Oakland.

106
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,892
加州，你是艾迪富森？
California. ls your name Felson? Eddie Felson?

107
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,894
没错
That's right.

108
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,355
听说你最近都在找我
l hear you've been looking for me.

109
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,525
没错
Yeah, that's right, too.

110
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,822
约翰，你觉得他是个老油条吗？
Big John, do you think this boy is a hustler?

111
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,165
你喜欢赌博？赌撞球赛？
Do you like to gamble? Gamble money on pool games?

112
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,919
我们现在就来打一场吧
Let's shoot a game of straight pool.

113
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,297
一百？
$100?

114
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:28,428
大家都说你的价位很高
You shoot bigtime pool. Everyone says you shoot bigtime pool.

115
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,390
一场两百好了
Let's make it $200 a game.

116
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,814
怪不得大家叫你“刽子手艾迪”，你跟我还蛮像的
Now l know why they call you ''Fast Eddie.'' You talk my kind of talk.

117
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,484
准备一下！
Sausage, rack them up!

118
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,923
禁止比赛！

119
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,063
- 感觉怎样？  - 还不错
- How do you feel?  - Fast and loose, man.

120
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,982
紧张吗？
ln the gut, l mean?

121
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
还可以
Tight but good.

122
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,594
威利，等一下
Willie, hang on to that.

123
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,994
你开球
You break.

124
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,935
很厉害吧
l didn't leave you much.

125
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,238
还可以
You left enough.

126
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,866
角落的六号球
Six in the corner.

127
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,591
角落的十五号球
Fifteen, in the corner.

128
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,850
旁边的王牌球
Ace, in the side.

129
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,524
八号
Eight.

130
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,576
十号

00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,043

273
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,636

00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,975
- 我欠你多少？  - 那小姐已经付了
- How much do l owe you?  - lt was paid for by the lady.

275
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,652
- 给我一点威士忌  - 好

276
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,657
- 要一杯啤酒吗？  - 不用了
- Want a chaser?  - No.

277
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,342
你旅途愉快吗？
Did you have a nice trip?

278
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,136
不错
Fair.

279
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,889
可以坐下吗？
May l sit down?

280
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,642
有何不可？我们反正都知道对方的秘密了
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

281
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,235
谢谢你请我吃早餐
Thanks for the breakfast.

282
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,700
晚上巧遇的陌生人，都应该请对方吃早餐
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.

283
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,827
可以请你喝杯酒吗？
Can l buy you another drink?

284
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,835
- 再给我们各一杯  - 知道了
Another one for me and the lady.

285
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,588
你看起来不太一样
You look different...

286
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,924
比较休闲
...more relaxed.

287
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,718
应该是因为灯光和酒吧
lt's the lights and the Scotch.

288
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,304
你怎么没搭公车？
How come you didn't catch your bus?

289
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,389
我其实没有在等公车
l wasn't waiting for a bus.

290
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,433
那干嘛到车站？
Then why go to the station?

291
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,852
原因跟你一样
For the same reason you went.

292
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,272
那种时候也没别的地方可去吧
At that hour, you haven't got much choice.

293
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,528
何况我就住在车站附近
Besides, l only live three blocks from there.

294
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,740
你住哪里？
Where do you live?

295
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,284
附近
Around.

296
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,453
我知道你住哪
l know where you live.

297
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,583
就在公车站的铁柜里
ln a locker in a bus station.

298
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,630
住在铁柜里感觉怎样？
What's it like living in a locker?

299
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,049
很挤
Cramped.

300
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,054
你早上都会这样喝酒？
Do you always drink like this so early in the morning?

301
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,432
你平常都这么喜欢发问？
Do you always ask so many questions?

302
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,936
平常不会
Not always.

303
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,066
有时候我起床，睡不着就会喝点酒
Sometimes l wake up and l can't sleep, not without a drink.

304
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,111
酒吧八点才开张
The bars don't open until 8:00.

305
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,742
麦克很信任我，就算我没钱，也相信我一定会还
Mac, over there, has faith in me. When l'm broke he trusts me.

306
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,079
麦克，我说得没错吧？
Don't you trust me, Mac?

307
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,747
当然
Check.

308
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,586
我有钱的时候，家里通常会有酒
When l'm not broke, l usually have a bottle in my room...

309
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,297
帮助我入睡
...in which case l sleep very well indeed.

310
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,926
你还蛮幽默的，我喜欢
You talk kind of funny, but l like it.

311
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,596
我以前是演员
l used to be an actress.

312
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,222
你现在做什么？
What do you do now?

313
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:47,852
我是大学生，每星期二和星期四上课
l'm a college girl, two days a week. On Tuesdays and Thursdays l go to college.

314
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,356
你看起来不像学生
You don't look like a college girl.

315
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,944
我是那种解放型的学生
l'm the emancipated type, real emancipated.

316
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:02,074
我的意思是你看起来没那么年轻
l didn't mean that. Whatever that means. l mean you just don't look young enough.

317
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,284
我是不年轻
l'm not.

318
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,286
那干嘛要上学？
Then why go to college?

319
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,456
因为星期二和星期四没事做
Got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

320
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,833
那其它时间都在干嘛？
What do you do on the other days?

321

我好困喔，非常谢谢你
l'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr....

324
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,807
我的名字叫艾迪
Eddie, the name is Eddie.

325
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,227
很适合你的名字
The name should be Eddie.

326
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,396
我应该要叫什么？
What should my name be?

327
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,650
我也不知道，看你喜欢什么名字
l don't know, whatever you like it to be.

328
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,653
我喜欢莎拉这个名字
l like it to be what it is, Sarah.

329
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:43,240
那是取自圣经的名字，你知道有什么涵义吗？
That's a Biblical name. Do you want to know its meaning?

330
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,663
想要再喝一点吗？

00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,456
为什么要找我？

别这样！你太饥渴了

00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,166
- 你是艾迪富森嘛！  - 他是谁？
- You're Eddie Felson!  - Who is he?

There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom, compliments of the house.

...l've got troubles and l think maybe you've got troubles.

371
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,750
我们还是不要继续下去吧
Maybe we should leave each other alone.

372
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,302
我的东西都放在旅馆，待会儿我再去拿，过来

373
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,637

Now, in three days, it seems like l know everybody.

385
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,068
我在街上碰到邻居

386
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,530
都会停下来告诉他们：“我有男朋友了！”
...l want to stop them and say, ''Listen, l've got a fellow! ''

387
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,746
谢谢

388
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,423
艾迪，你通常出去都去哪里？

博物馆、美术馆、音乐会
Museums, art galleries, concerts.

390
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,600
你说你去上学，我还不是也相信你
l believe you when you say you go to school.

391
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:37,811
- 你想跟我一起来吗？  - 开什么玩笑？
- Do you want to go with me?  - Are you kidding?

392

看到这本书没有？

395
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,326
都记得起来？
Got it all in your head?

396

397
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,084
别把自己形容得像酒鬼，我不喜欢
Stop talking about yourself like you're a lush. l don't like it.

398
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,714
你应该去戒酒中心治疗一下
You should go to a clinic, and get some treatment.

399
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,300
我现在就在接受治疗

403
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,064
你花了多少钱啊？
What did all this stuff cost you?

404
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,109
- 你有钱的时候再还我吧  - 先告诉我，这样我才不会忘
- When you got money, you'll pay.  - l want to know, to keep the score.

405
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,946
账单都在这里，你又没说你要看
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.

406
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,035
- 你都不做饭吗？  - 我会煮蛋，你喜欢哪一种？
- Don't you ever cook anything?  - Eggs. How do you like them?

407
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,870
生一点
Raw.

408
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,208
我切到手指了
l cut my finger.

409
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,462
- 我包包里应该有药  - 不会很严重啦
- l got something in my bag.  - lt's not bad.

410
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,141
艾迪，那行李箱里面装了什么？
Eddie, what's in that case?

411
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:04,856
- 你还没打开来看？  - 当然没有，是你的东西啊
- Haven't you opened it?  - No. Why should l? lt's yours.

412
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,942
是一把机关枪
lt's a machine gun.

413
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:13,615
有人告诉我到大城市要带枪，所以我就带着它
A guy told me, in the big city l'd need a machine gun. So l bought one.

414
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,582
你怎么会有钱买这些东西？
Where did you get the money to pay for all this?

415
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,838
又买酒又买菜，还要付房租
l mean liquor and the groceries and the rent.

416
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,219
我以前的情人是个有钱的老头
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.

417
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,484
你好，艾迪
Hello, Eddie.

418
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,407
查理，你好
Hello, Charlie.

419
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,660
请进
Come on in.

420
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,168
- 那是我马子  - 你好，艾迪的马子
- That's my girl.  - Hello, Eddie's girl.

421
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,630
我到处在找你
l looked all over for you.

422
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:14,760
- 你怎么找到的？  - 我到处问
- How did you find me?  - l asked around.

423
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,058
- 要我先离开一下吗？  - 不用
- Do you want me to go?  - No. Stick around.

424
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,855
- 需要喝点东西吗？  - 不用麻烦了
- Can we get you a drink?  - l don't want to be no bother.

425
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,066
不要这么谦虚，看起来真的有够假
Don't play it small. lt don't look good on you.

426
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,278
- 你要我怎样？我都没钱了  - 我也没钱
- How do you want me to play? l'm broke.  - So am l.

427
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,363
坐下
Sit down.

428
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,533
帮我们倒点东西吧
Would you get us a couple of drinks?

429
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:44,664
你怎么就这样一声不响地离开，就像小偷一样
You walked out on me. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark.

430
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,169
我们是伙伴耶，交情又不浅
We were partners, more than partners.

431
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,421
他对我来说就像
He was like a....

432
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,259
- 儿子一样  - 就像儿子
- A son.  - Yes, like a son.

433
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,848
他16岁时，我们就认识了，我第一次在奥克兰看到他
l've known him since he was 16. The first time l saw him in Oakland, l said:

434
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:07,395
我说：“这小子真有天份又很聪明”
''This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy.''

435
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,022
少说废话了
Talk to me.

436
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,776
跟我一起上路吧
l want you to come back on the road with me.

437
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,530
我不想再过那种生活了
l have no stomach for that kind of life anymore.

438
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:21,827
你在这有过好日子吗？每天也不过赢一点小钱
What is your life like here? Playing the small rooms, winning a few bucks a day.

439
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,746
我会去帮你建立关系，我们一起把钱赚回来
l'll connect. l'll get your money back.

440
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:30,001
你想要到艾拇斯挑战肥子吗？是不是有这打算？
Do you intend to play Fats again at Ames? ls that what's on your mind?

441
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:35,257
我从没别的打算，一定要把那肥老头打败
Never been out of it. l'm going to beat that fat man...

442
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:40,428
一头捲发，还有那么多钻石戒指，我看了就烦
...with that curly hair and those diamond rings and that carnation.

443
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,475
这小子头脑有问题他上次痛宰你，你现在还想去找死
This boy is crazy! They wiped the floor with him and he wants to go back.

444
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:50,063
- 干嘛啊？又想输钱？  - 一定会把钱赢回来！
- What for? Another beating?  - You'll get your money back!

445
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:54,818
他以为我在乎那些钱，我在乎的是你
He thinks l care about the money. l care about you.

446
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,155
艾迪，你在乎我吗？
Do you care about me, Eddie?

447
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,284
我们朝夕相处，合作了这么久
We were together a long time, night and day.

448
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,078
你要跟我分道扬镳？
So how do you say goodbye?

449
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,833
把车子给我，外加一百块
You give me the car and $100.

450
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,963
你以为我在乎钱和车子我在乎的是你
Do you think l care about the dough or the car? l care about you.

451
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,427
他是撞球场上顶尖的老油条
This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw.

452
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:24,890
非常有自信，随便就能让人中计
A high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything.

453
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:29,436
他有没有告诉你我们赚了多少我们曾经拥有一切
Did he tell you how well we did on the road? We had everything.

454
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,063
吃得好，睡得好
We ate well, we slept late...

455
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:35,692
有大把钞票可花，每天都有美酒美女相伴
...we had money to burn. Whiskey, dames.... Excuse me.

456
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,321
我们带她一起走好了
l tell you what, take her along.

457
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,742
要是你想等一下，那我们也不用急
And if you don't want to start right away, we won't start right away.

458
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,412
我们开车到迈阿密，好好放松心情
We'll drive to Miami. Get it all out of your system.

459
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:51,041
晒晒太阳，开心一点
Have a few laughs, a few weeks in the sun.

460
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:58,089
- 哪来的钱？  - 不用担心，我去准备
- With what?  - Don't worry, l'll raise the money.

461
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,761
- 怎么准备？  - 有差吗？我去张罗就好
- Yeah? Where?  - What's the difference? l'll raise it.

462
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,225
可以再给我喝一杯吗？
Could l have another drink?

463
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,536
查理，你是不是有骗我钱？
Did you hold out on me, Charlie?

464
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,082
你拿了多少？
How much?

465
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,376
多少？
How much?

466
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:42,133
我的两成五，大概是一千五百吧
My 25%. Approximately $1,500.

467
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:49,015
你这个大烂人我可以用那笔钱打败他
You crumb! With that much l could have beat him! That's all l needed.

468
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,434
还给我！
Give me the money!

469
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:55,021
- 干嘛，让你再度挑战肥子？  - 对，再度挑战肥子！
- What for, to play Fats again?  - Yes, l'll play Fats again!

470
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,483
要是你愿意跟我一起上路，钱都是你的
lf you want to come back on the road, the money is yours...

471
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,736
要是你又要跟肥子对战，钱的事想都别想
...but not if you want to give it to Fats.

472
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,863
怎样？
What do you say?

473
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:09,953
查理，你还是搞不懂你不过是个无名小卒
You still don't see, do you, Charlie? You're nothing but a small-time Charlie.

474
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,249
很喜欢叫我去赌场上卖命？
You would love to keep me hustling, wouldn't you?

475
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,836
再过几年，我还在小镇间卖命赌博
ln a couple more years, with me playing in those little towns...

476
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,714
我看你八成都有钱买下撞球场了
...you might be able to buy a poolroom in Oakland...

477
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,800
而且还是大规模的撞球场
...six tables and a handbook on the side.

478
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,512
到时候再把我甩掉？
ls that when you say goodbye to me?

479
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,141
- 你是这样想的？  - 没错，正是
- ls that what you think?  - Yeah. That's what l think.

480
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,062
好，那就是我想要的
All right, that's what l want...

481
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,025
一个赌博撞球场
...a poolroom and a little handbook on the side.

482
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,569
我年纪不小了
l'm getting old.

483
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,034
那你去死吧，不要把我也拖下水
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.

484
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,419
- 就这样  - 对，就这样！
- Just like that.  - Yes, just like that!

485
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,772
小妞，谢谢你的招待
Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.

486
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,455
再给我一杯
Give me another drink.

487
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,917
天哪
Boy.

488
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,629
大家都想利用我！
Everybody wants a piece of me!

489
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,555
你不跟我一起喝？
Won't you have one?

490
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,439
他回来到底要干嘛？
What did he have to come back here for, anyway?

491
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,613
过来
Come here.

492
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,448
过来
Come here.

493
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:56,161
- 你要出去？  - 一下就回来
- Are you going out?  - For a little while.

494
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,212
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

495
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,741
你在写什么？
What are you writing?

496
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,704
我编出来的故事
lt's a story. A story l'm making up.

497
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,422
还我啦
Give it to me.

498
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,177
这是什么意思？
What is this supposed to mean?

499
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,679
还给我！
Give it back to me!

500
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,024
这到底是什么意思？
What does this mean?

501
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:12,820
“我们只是相互欺瞒同流合污”
''We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is draw the blinds.''

502
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,249
这算什么故事！
Write yourself another story!

503
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,752
我们本来就是这样啊
Well, what else have we got?

504
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,297
我们根本不会和对方谈心
We never talk about anything.

505
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:37,303
我们一天到晚都待在家里，喝酒然后做爱
We stay here in this room and we drink and we make love.

506
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,974
我们根本是陌生人！
We're strangers!

507
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,395
艾迪，要是我们没有钱、没有酒，该怎么过活？
What happens when the liquor and money run out, Eddie?

508
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,982
你叫查理去死
You told Charlie to lay down and die.

509
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,943
你也想要我去死吗？
Will you say that to me, too?

510
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,573
艾迪，怎么啦？
What happens, Eddie?

511
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:03,997
- 你去找个有钱的老头吧  - 没错，你一定会帮我找到对象
- You find another rich old lover.  - That's right. And l'm sure you'll help me!

512
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,088
你想要看我掉眼泪？
Are you waiting for me to cry?

513
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,633
你这个败类！
You bum!

514
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,303
只会打撞球的败类！
You poolroom bum!

515
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,027
- 给我一瓶啤酒  - 好
- Give me a bottle of beer.  - Right.

516
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,575
- 你手气怎样？  - 赚了一点钱
- How did you make out?  - l made a few bucks.

517
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,786
- 打牌？  - 对
- Poker game?  - Yeah.

518
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,371
我可以加入吗？
ls it open?

519
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,877
可以
lt's open.

520
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,880
- 想喝点什么？  - 啤酒
- What will you have?  - Give me a beer.

521
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,057
- 好吗？  - 请坐
- Okay?  - Sit down.

522
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,188
- 最高是多少？  - 一块半
- What's the limit?  - Half and a dollar.

523
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,150
- 给我10块的赌注  - 10块
- Give me $10 worth of chips.  - $10.

524
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,906
- 给我20  - 20
- Make it $20.  - $20.

525
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,868
切牌
Cut.

526
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,245
发牌
Deal.

527
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,760
- 威士忌  - 两杯
- Bourbon. J.T.S. Brown.  - Two.

528
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,013
我请你
l'm buying.

529
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,683
我还以为你只喝牛奶
l thought you only drank milk.

530
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,478
- 只有上班的时候  - 怎么会？
- Only when l work.  - Yeah? Why?

531
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,981
我喜欢牛奶，很有营养
l like it. lt's good for you.

532
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:59,362
赌博的时候喝酒，输钱也比较坦荡，不过对你来说没差吧
lf you're gambling, whiskey gives you an excuse for losing. You don't need that.

533
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:04,575
- 你牌打得怎样？  - 输了20块
- How did you make out in the poker game?  - l lost $20.

534
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,369
你不适合打牌啦
Poker's not your game.

535
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,913
- 那我适合什么？  - 打撞球
- What is?  - Pool.

536
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,709
你在讽刺我？
Are you being cute?

537
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:20,007
我从没看过像你这么厉害的撞球高手
No pool player shoots better pool than you shot the other night at Ames.

538
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:24,262
- 很有天份  - 我有天份，那缺点是什么？
- You have talent.  - So l have talent. So what beat me?

539
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,641
- 耍个性  - 是喔
- Character.  - Yeah, sure.

540
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:33,020
没错，每个人都有天份，我也有天份
You're damn right, l'm sure. Everybody has talent. l have talent.

541
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:38,401
你以为有天份就能成为撞球高手，或是牌局之王？
You think you can play big-money pool or poker for 40 hours with only talent?

542
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:43,030
肥子成为全国顶尖高手，是因为他有天份？才不是
ls Fats the best in the country just because he has talent? No.

543
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,452
是因为他有一种不同凡响的特质
He has more character in one finger than you have in your body.

544
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,621
- 我那晚喝醉了  - 你们喝的一样多
- l got drunk.  - He drank as much whiskey as you did.

545
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,541
- 他酒量很好  - 我知道
- He knows how to drink.  - You bet he knows how.

546
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,918
你觉得那也是天份？
You think that's a talent, too?

547
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,129
你以为肥子天生就会喝酒？
You think Fats was born knowing how to drink?

548
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:02,675
你想要我怎样跪下来跟你磕头？
Okay, what do l do now? Lie down and bow from the ankles?

549
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,220
- 你要我回家？  - 随便你想怎样
- What do l do, go home?  - That's your problem.

550
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,889
还是应该留下来？
Or do l stay?

551
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,393
等到我有钱，再去挑战肥子
Stay until l hustle up enough to play Fats again.

552
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:16,522
说不定到时候，我就会比较有特质
Maybe, by that time, l'll have developed some character.

553
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,611
说不定你到时候就上西天了
Maybe, by that time, you'll die of old age.

554
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:27,617
- 你要多少钱？  - 一千
- How much will you need?  - $1,000.

555
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,661
起码要三千吧
At least $3,000.

556
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,665
他一开始就会跟你赌五百，然后你马上就倾家荡产
He'll start at $500 a game, and he'll beat the pants off you.

557
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,960
他跟玩家都是这样赌的
That's the way he plays against a man who knows the way the game is.

558
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:42,757
然后看你打得怎样，他会再跟你赌个几局
He'll beat you five times or more, depending on your nerves.

559
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:48,721
他也可能会怕你，说不定到时候情况会不同
He might be scared of you. That could change things, but don't count on it.

560
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,684
你怎么会知道这么多？
How do you know when nobody knows that much?

561
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,980
你有看到外面停的那辆车吗？
Did you see that big car parked outside?

562
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,359
那是我的车，我很喜欢我的车
Well, that's mine. l like that car.

563
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:06,697
我每年都买新车，因为我对你跟他这种人太了解了
l get a new one every year, because l know what guys like you and him will do.

564
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,701
我那晚因为你赚到的钱，可以买两辆汽车
l made enough off you the other night to pay for it twice over.

565
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,204
那你应该再请我喝一杯吧
ln that case, you owe me another drink.

566
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,624
艾迪？
Eddie?

567
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,337
- 不介意我说几句吧？  - 你干嘛问这种问题？
- May l get personal?  - What have you been so far?

568
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,340
艾迪，你真是个天生的败类
Eddie, you're a born loser.

569
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,303
你什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

570
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,558
我第一次看到肥子这么紧张
lt was the first time l'd ever seen Fats hooked, really hooked.

571
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:37,270
- 但是你却放过他  - 我喝醉了嘛
- But you let him off.  - l got drunk.

572
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,439
我知道啊，所以输了也是理所当然
Sure you did. You have the best excuse for losing.

573
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,733
这种借口最好用了
No trouble losing when you have a good excuse.

574
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:46,946
不过赢钱就没那么容易是吧
But winning, that can be heavy on your back, too, like a monkey.

575
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:52,076
你不要再为自己找借口了，真的很可悲
You can drop that load with an excuse. You have to learn to feel sorry for yourself.

576
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,706
自衰自怜是最糟糕不过的事，大家都会犯的毛病
lt's one of the best indoor sports, feeling sorry for yourself, and enjoyed by all.

577
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,792
- 特别是那些天生败类  - 谢谢你的酒
- Especially the born losers.  - Thanks for the drink.

578
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,422
- 说不定我可以帮你  - 帮我干嘛？
- Wait. Maybe l can help you.  - To do what?

579
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,175
- 筹出三千块，再去挑战肥子  - 为什么？
- Get the $3,000, play Fats again.  - Why?

580
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:13,931
我可以想出十几个理由，对我来说也有好处
Ten reasons, maybe fifteen. Also there's something in it for me.

581
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,892
- 我想也是，要抽多少？  - 七成五
- l figured that. How much?  - 75%.

582
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,978
- 谁要抽？  - 我
- For who?  - For me.

583
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:25,818
也未免太高了吧，你以为自己是大公司？
That's a big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?

584
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,572
你觉得自己的价值是多少？
How much do you think you are worth these days?

585
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,909
我帮你筹钱和准备，要是你赢了，我当然可以抽七成五
l'm supplying the money and time, for that l get 75% return, if you win.

586
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,203
- 你觉得我会输吗？  - 你一天到晚输啊
- You think l can lose?  - That's all l've seen.

587
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:40,291
- 你明明就有看到我赢一万八  - 你想赌撞球？
- You saw me win $18,000.  - You want to hustle pool, don't you?

588
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,171
这又不是足球赛，也不是照里程付钱
The game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage.

589
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,340
你就好好打，专心一点
When you hustle, you keep score real simple.

590
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,093
比赛结束时，数数自己的钱，看谁比较厉害
At the end of the game, you count your money to find out who is best.

591
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:56,098
那你干嘛要找我何不去别人，然后再赚大钱？
Why back me, then? Back yourself, play poker and get rich.

592
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:01,228
我的钱以经够多了，我比较喜欢刺激，你正是我要的那种刺激
l am already rich, but l like action. That's one thing you're good for, action.

593
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:06,692
更何况你这么有天份
Besides, like l say, you've got talent.

594
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,780
你已经说过了
You already told me that.

595
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:16,035
要是你不抽那么多，我们还可以谈一谈
You cut that slice down to bite-size, and maybe we can talk.

596
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,122
不需要谈了，我从来都不改，一向是七成五和二成五
We don't talk. l don't make bad bets. lt is 75%-25%.

597
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,501
- 去死吧  - 等等
- Kiss off.  - Wait.

598
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:33,052
- 那你要怎么筹钱？  - 我到别的地方去想办法
- What'll you do about the money?  - There are places. l'll scuffle around.

599
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:37,723
艾迪，大家都知道了，只要有机会，他们就会伤害你
The word's out on you, Eddie. ln the wrong place, they'll eat you alive.

600
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,103
你什么时候收留我的？
When did you adopt me?

601
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,773
我也不知道
l don't know when it was.

602
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,460
阿瑟撞球场

603
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,653
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

604
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,289
你这个走运的家伙，我不想玩了！
You lucky punk. l quit you!

605
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,252
要不要打一场啊？
Do you want in, friend?

606
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:53,257
- 你们赌多少？  - 五号球1块，九号球2块
- How much are you playing for?  - $1 on the five. $2 on the nine.

607
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,471
- 我随便打几场就好  - 没问题
- l'll play a couple of games, just for kicks.  - Okay, friend.

608
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,307
我不想再玩了
That's it for me.

609
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,644
我也不想打了
That does it for me, too.

610
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,648
- 你也不玩了？  - 你打得还蛮好的
- Are you quitting, too?  - You're a pretty good player.

611
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,818
- 你赢多少？  - 几块钱而已
- How much are you ahead?  - A couple of bucks.

612
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:17,323
- 只剩下我们两个  - 看样子好像是吧
- lt's just you and me.  - l guess it is, boy. Just you and me.

613
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:21,827
想把赌注提高吗五号球2块，九号球5块
Do you want to raise the bet? $2 on the five. $5 on the nine.

614
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:27,208
小子，你还真是个老油条
You know, kid, l think maybe you're a hustler.

615
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,126
- 那可不  - 开球
- Try me.  - Shoot.

616
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,003
好
Okay.

617
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,527
你真的想赌？
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?

618
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,698
我们就干脆一点好了，谁赢谁就拿1百块
Let's cut out the small stuff. $100 freeze-out.

619
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,743
一场十块，打十场，谁赢谁就把钱拿走
Ten games at $10 a game, the winner takes all.

620
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,537
看看谁比较厉害
Then we'll see who quits.

621
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,206
好，赌就赌
Okay, friend, you're on.

622
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,543
- 你选  - 正面
- Call it.  - Heads.

623
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,380
算你赢
You win.

624
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,394
最好不要失手，老兄
You better not miss, friend.

625
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:34,066
我稳得很，只是你在那儿瞎搅和，看我来好好收拾你！
l don't rattle, kid. But just for that, l'm going to beat you flat!

626
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:42,908
一号球
That's one.

627
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,749
五号球
That's five.

628
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,837
六号球
That's six.

629
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,261
十号球
That's ten.

630
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,431
你这不入流的痞子！给钱，一百元！
You two-bit punk, come on. Pay up, $100!

631
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,148
- 不玩啦，老兄？  - 不玩啦
- You quitting, friend?  - Yes, l'm quitting.

632
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:36,378
兄弟，你是老千一个，十足老千一个
Why, you're a pool shark, boy. A real pool shark.

633
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:41,800
- 他也是  - 你比他厉害，高杆多了
- So is he.  - You're better than he was. Much better.

634
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,804
哪，你的钱
There's your money, boy.

635
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,482
哪，你的钱
There's your money, boy.

636
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,698
老千！
Pool shark!

637
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,033
等等…
Wait a minute.

638
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,329
给这家伙钱吧
Let's give this boy his money.

639
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:15,250
输的钱我们绝不赖账
We always pay what we lose, boy.

640
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,840
这些老千都一样，没啥了不起
We've got no use for pool sharks around here!

641
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,599
绅士

642
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,878
- 谁呀？  - 是我，艾迪
- Who is it?  - lt's me, Eddie.

643
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,743
怎么啦？
What happened?

644
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,247
我被扁啦
l got beat up.

645
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,755
他们扭伤了我的拇指
They broke my thumbs.

646
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,425
天哪！
God!

647
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,596
莎拉，他们扭伤了我的拇指
Sarah, they broke my thumbs.

648
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,851
把我的拇指扭伤了
Broke my thumbs.

649
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,825
没关系
lt's all right.

650
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,953
有我呢
l'm here.

651
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,525
要看就拿去看吧
You can read it if you want to.

652
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,738
想出去走走吗看场电影吧？
Do you want to go out for a while? To a movie?

653
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,407
不要
No.

654
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,787
- 要喝点什么？  - 不要，你要喝？
- Do you want a drink?  - No, do you?

655
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,299
这儿怎么这么热？
What's it so hot in here for?

656
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,434
拜托！
Please!

657
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,498
- 莎拉，你认为我是个输家吗？  - 输家？
- Sarah, do you think l'm a loser?  - A loser?

658
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:06,708
嗯
Yeah.

659
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:11,964
我遇到巴特戈登这家伙，他说我是个天生的输家
l met this guy, Bert Gordon. He said l was a born loser.

660
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,175
- 他怎知道？  - 他知道的可多呢
- Would he know?  - He knows a lot.

661
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,305
- 他又为什么告诉你这个？  - 不清楚
- Why did he tell you?  - l'm not sure.

662
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:24,518
他说有一些人，硬是找罪受，爱当输家
He says there are people who always look for an excuse to lose.

663
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,231
- 这巴特戈登是做什么的？  - 赌徒一个
- What does this Bert Gordon do?  - He's a gambler.

664
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,652
- 包赢的赌徒？  - 他专门包赌
- ls he a winner?  - He owns things.

665
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,990
- 包赌就是包赢？  - 还有什么其他方法能包赢？
- ls that what makes a winner?  - What else does?

666
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,745
- 他说的话令你懊恼吗？  - 嗯
- Does it bother you, what he said?  - Yeah.

667
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,584
我非常懊恼
lt bothers me a lot.

668
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,547
因为已经有两回了，一回和肥子在艾拇斯
Because, you see, twice, once at Ames with Fats...

669
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,842
另一次在阿瑟那儿…
...and then again at Arthur's....

670
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:01,305
那家廉价无聊的弹子房，我怎么会那样，莎拉？
That cheap, crummy poolroom. Why did l do it, Sarah?

671
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:05,183
我该狠狠修理他一顿，他却毫不知情
l could have beat that guy cold. He never would've known.

672
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,061
我真该露一手
l just had to show him.

673
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:13,650
真该让这些小混混见识一下，什么叫做精彩的表现
l had to show those punks how great the game can be when it's great.

674
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:18,071
其实，不论做啥事都可以表现精彩
You know, anything can be great, anything.

675
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,742
如果熟练，砌砖也可以表现一流
Bricklaying can be great if a guy knows.

676
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:26,204
如果泥水匠经验老练，虚心努力，照样可以令人叹服
lf he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off.

677
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:31,251
就像当我全神贯注在球局中，感觉像是…
Why, when l'm really going, l feel like a....

678
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:38,967
赛马骑士骑在马匹上，感受到的飞驰和冲力
Like a jockey must feel sitting on his horse, with all that speed and power underneath.

679
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,846
即将抵达最后一圈，那种冲刺的压力和刺激
He's coming into the stretch, the pressure's on and he knows.

680
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:47,559
他凭感觉知道缰绳该如何收放，力道适中
He just feels when to let it go, and how much.

681
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:52,147
时间和力道的拿捏，一切都在他掌握当中
He's got everything working for him. Timing, touch.

682
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,068
极棒的体验
lt's a great feeling.

683
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,322
极棒的体验，你就是要深谙个中要领
A real great feeling, when you're right and you know it.

684
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:05,619
突然间，我臂膀上了油一般，球杆成为我身体的一部份
Suddenly, there's oil in my arm. The pool cue is part of me.

685
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:10,082
球杆也受神经的指挥，变成了一支神奇的木杆
The pool cue has nerves in it. lt's a piece of wood with nerves.

686
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,379
它能应付滚动的球，不需要你去察看，你就是感觉得到
Feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look, you just know.

687
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,634
你就击出前所未有的好球
You make shots that nobody's ever made before.

688
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:26,973
你所表现的就是，前无古人、后无来者的撞球赛局
And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.

689
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,353
你不是输家，而是赢家
You're not a loser, you're a winner.

690
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:36,274
有些人却是从来不曾，体验过这种滋味
Some men never feel that way about anything.

691
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,611
艾迪，我爱你
l love you, Eddie.

692
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,748
莎拉，将来有一天你会有个归宿
Some day, Sarah, you'll settle down.

693
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:59,131
或许嫁个大学教授，写本伟大的书，也可能是有关我的故事
You'll marry a college professor. You'll write a great book, maybe about me.

694
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,717
大老千，刽子手艾迪富森
''Fast Eddie Felson, Hustler.''

695
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,101
我爱你
l love you.

696
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,605
需要言语吗？
Do you need the words?

697
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,775
嗯，非常需要
Yes, l need them very much.

698
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:23,655
你说了就算数，不准食言而肥
lf you ever say them, l'll never let you take them back.

699
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,346
高兴了吧？
You glad?

700
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,559
嗯，高兴
Yes, l'm glad.

701
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,709
嗨，艾迪
Hello, Eddie.

702
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:19,711
嗨
Hi.

703
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,506
- 生意如何？  - 淡季
- How's business?  - Slow.

704
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:27,761
- 手怎么了？  - 在一家叫阿瑟的店发生了意外
- Something wrong with your hand?  - l had an accident. A place called Arthur's.

705
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,972
你这样看起来还好嘛
You seem to do all right that way.

706
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:34,059
我的表现比之前降低两成，或许更多
My game is about 20% off, maybe more.

707
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,897
- 有人侵犯你了吗？  - 有个混蛋扭伤了我的拇指
- Did somebody step on your hand?  - A big creep broke my thumbs.

708
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,233
是个叫特克的家伙吗？
A man named Turk?

709
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,528
你倒是交游广阔呢！
You know everybody, don't you?

710
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:48,114
知己知彼，百战百胜嘛，挺划算的
Everybody who can hurt me or help me. lt pays.

711
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,951
- 你应该传授一下  - 报名啊
- You should give me lessons.  - Sign up.

712
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,245
去哪儿报？
Where do l sign?

713
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:57,249
我想到的第一等对手赛，是在肯塔基州的路易斯维尔
The first match l have in mind is in Louisville, Kentucky.

714
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,085
老哥，说出地点来，我必奉陪
Name the place, boss, l'll be there.

715
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,921
- 怎么啦？  - 告诉过你的，拇指扭伤啦
- What happened?  - Like l told you, my thumbs.

716
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,173
不是说你的拇指，你说过啦
l don't mean the thumbs. You already told me.

717
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,926
- 我一直在想  - 想什么呢？
- l've been thinking.  - Thinking about what?

718
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:13,974
也许现阶段我不是，一块什么好料
Maybe l'm not such a great piece of property right now.

719
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:19,729
四分之一匹的丝绸，胜过整匹的粗布
A 25% slice of something big is better than a 100% slice of nothing.

720
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,608
来两杯饮料
Give us a couple of drinks.

721
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,444
威士忌
J.T.S. Brown.

722
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,621
- 先生，晚安  - 晚安
- Good evening, sir.  - 'Evening.

723
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:42,210
- 给我们一个安静点的好位子  - 是，这边请
- Give us a nice quiet table.  - Yes, sir, right this way.

724
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:10,238
用餐前要不要喝点什么？
Would you like a drink before dinner?

725
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,573
好吗？
Okay?

726
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,827
陈年无甜味的雪利酒
Sherry, very old, very dry.

727
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,496
两杯
Two.

728
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,374
雪利酒？
Sherry?

729
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:30,675
- 这地方挺棒，你真美  - 我感觉不错
- lt's a nice joint. You look very pretty.  - l feel pretty.

730
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:37,265
- 有什么好笑的吗？  - 你的领带
- What's so funny?  - Your tie.

731
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,809
没见过你打领带
l've never seen you wear one before.

732
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,229
凡事总有头一遭嘛
There's a first time for everything.

733
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,033
嗯，这样挺好
Yeah, that's great.

734
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:01,373
抱歉
Excuse me.

735
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,893
艾迪，敬你
To you, Eddie.

736
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,120
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

737
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,543
艾迪，那是什么？
What is it, Eddie?

738
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,213
再来一杯吗？
Want another drink?

739
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,925
你要告诉我什么事？
What do you want to tell me?

740
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,595
我要出城一下
l'll be leaving town for a little while.

741
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,601
多久？
For how long?

742
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:07,605
- 还不知道  - 一星期，一年？
- l don't know.  - A week, a year?

743
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:12,736
- 一星期左右吧，总会回来的  - 当然
- More like a week. l'll be back.  - Sure.

744
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,822
回家吧
Let's go home.

745
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,263
计程车！
Taxi!

746
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,641
- 不要，我要走路  - 过来这儿
- No, l'll walk.  - Come here.

747
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,994
最好穿些干爽的衣服
Better get some dry things on.

748
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:20,553
- 你不想知道我要去哪儿吗？  - 不想
- Don't you want to know where l'm going?  - No.

749
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:28,353
我是想知道你去做什么，可是却不想问
Yes, l want to know what for, but l don't want to ask.

750
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,905
我要和一个朋友，去肯塔基州的路易斯维尔
l'm going to Kentucky, to Louisville with a friend.

751
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,575
我需要钱，想去看看能不能赚点钱
l'm going to try to make some money. l need it.

752
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,120
一大早就要动身
l'll leave early in the morning.

753
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,124
- 现在就走  - 别孩子气了
- Leave now.  - Grow up.

754
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,294
我干嘛要走？
Why should l?

755
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,965
我要去那儿，和一个叫做芬德利的家伙赌撞球
l'm going there to play pool with a guy named Findley.

756
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,759
我需要一点激励，也需要钱
l need the action and l need the money.

757
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,678
告诉过你我会回来嘛
l told you l'd be back.

758
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:06,641
如果你打算要回来，就不会带我出来又买了洋装给我
lf you were returning, you wouldn't have taken me out or bought this dress.

759
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:10,395
你骗我，永远都在骗我
You're hustling me. You've never stopped hustling me.

760
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:15,066
不，我从来没骗过你，你知道的，即使我自认为在骗你
No, l've never hustled you, even when l thought l was, you know it.

761
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,611
你就是要我在这痴痴的等一辈子？
Do you want me to sit and wait?

762
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:22,699
忠心耿耿的小莎拉，低调一点，耐心等待
Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit.

763
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,910
你想回来的时候，就会回来，好好爱我
When you feel like coming back, you'll come back and love me.

764
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:29,372
然后过不久又要走人，这就是你说的爱我吗？
And then you'll go away again. ls that your idea of love?

765
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,293
我不明白什么叫做爱
l've got no idea of love.

766
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:39,173
如果我们看到它从街道上走过来，我们俩都不知道它是什么
Neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.

767
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,218
我会知道
l'd know it.

768
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,389
我会知道
l'd know it.

769
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,186
老天爷，你究竟要把我怎样？
For God's sake, what are you doing to me?

770
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,688
我爱你
l love you.

771
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,317
你爱的定义是什么，锁链吗？
What's your idea of love, chains?

772
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:02,405
不
No.

773
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,457
我凭空想像你，可不是吗，艾迪？
l made you up, didn't l, Eddie?

774
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,253
你是虚幻的
You weren't real.

775
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,256
我像其他东西一样，凭空想像你
l made you up like everything else.

776
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,010
艾迪，我根本没有被车撞过
There was no car crash, Eddie.

777
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,306
我五岁就患了小儿麻痹症
When l was five l had polio.

778
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:33,394
我从没当过演员，老富翁是我老爸
l was never an actress. The rich old man is my father.

779
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,564
我七岁时他就弃我们而去
He walked out on us when l was seven.

780
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:41,194
每个月他寄来一张支票，用来换取从我的生命中消失
He sends a check every month to buy his way out of my life.

781
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,239
我所认识过的男人…
The men l've known...

782
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:49,702
离我而去以后，我告诉自己，“他们不是真的，是我凭空想像的”
...after they'd left, l'd say, ''They weren't real, l made them up.''

783
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,832
可是你，艾迪，我要一个真实的你
But you, Eddie, l wanted you to be real.

784
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,172
我好怕啊！
l'm so scared!

785

我怕
l'm scared.

786
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:23,236
- 这位莎拉派克，这位巴特戈登  - 幸会幸会
- Sarah Packard, Bert Gordon.  - How do you do?

787
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,535
我的朋友要去接待室A
That one of mine goes in Drawing Room A.

788
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,412
谢谢
Thank you.

789
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,163
明白了

790
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:42,755
- 你真的还好吗，小姐…  - 派克，莎拉派克
- You sure you'll be comfortable, Miss....  - Packard. Sarah Packard.

791
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:45,258
我总得花些时间去记一个名字
lt takes me a while to memorize a name.

792
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:48,177
- 你真的什么都不要吗？  - 不，不用
- Are you sure you don't want anything?  - No, l'm fine.

793
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,266
派克小姐，你参加过，路易斯维尔的德比周活动吗？
You ever been to Louisville for Derby week, Miss Packard?

794
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:58,229
- 我没来过路易斯维尔  - 活动多又到处是钱，正点
- l've never been to Louisville.  - Lots of action, lots of money, lots of class.

795
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,191
你可以在这儿看到，全世界最珠光宝气的贵妇人
You see the best dressed, most beautiful women in the world.

796
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,443
让你目不暇给
Knock your eyes out.

797
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:13,619
芬德利是个小开，他祖父留给他，一家烟草公司的五分之一财富
Findley is rich. His grandfather left him 20% of a tobacco company.

798
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,414
嗄，他还诈赌？
What, and he hustles, too?

799
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,544
他是个绅士，绅士老千，纯粹迷上诈赌的刺激趣味
He's a gentleman, a gentleman gambler who gets his kicks playing with hustlers.

800
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:24,505
他有栋南方风格的豪宅，里头有撞球台
He's got an old southern mansion, with a pool table.

801
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:27,300
喝的是八年波旁威士忌，抽的是有软木滤嘴的高级烟
He drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.

802
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,510
- 他有多高杆？  - 不知道
- How good is he?  - l don't know.

803
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:32,472
- 我没看他玩过，听说技术一流  - 我恭候领教
- l never saw him play. l hear he's great.  - l'm ready.

804
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,474
咖啡喝完我立刻就来
As soon as l've finished my coffee.

805
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:37,518
- 你对我信心十足喔  - 才不
- You have great confidence in me.  - l don't.

806
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,272
- 我对芬德利信心十足  - 这话什么意思？
- l've confidence in Findley.  - What's that supposed to mean?

807
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:44,567
我是说，肯定他会是输家，一路输到底
lt means l'm confident he's a loser. All the way a loser.

808
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:48,404
你不过是个，输赢各半的中间角色
You are only about one half loser, the other half winner.

809
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,531
- 喝完了  - 知道
- l'm finished.  - l got it.

810
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:54,118
不，你替我出力，我就应买单请客
No. When you play for me, l pick up all the tabs.

811
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:01,501
肥子知道赌局危急紧张，所以必须略施小技来挡你
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, so he had to do something to stop you.

812
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:05,880
- 他深谙此道  - 我也心里有数
- He played it smart.  - l've played that game in my head, too.

813
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,049
再重来，越挫越勇
Play it again. Learn something.

814
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,845
肥子去了洗手间
Fats went to the john.

815
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:16,349
他洗了脸，清了指甲，梳理了头发
He washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank...

816
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:19,602
挖空了心思，一副备战架势的走回来
...combed his hair, and came back all ready to go.

817
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:21,687
你完蛋了
You were through.

818
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:27,068
你看他那架势，革新洗面，准备好要东山再起
You saw how he looked, clean, ready to start all over again.

819
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,861
严阵以待，全力以赴
Hold tight and push hard.

820
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,657
你可知道你在做什么坐以待毙！
Do you know what you were doing? You were waiting to get beat.

821
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:39,372
陶醉在荣耀与威士忌中的你，未战已败…
You were flattened out on your butt, swimming in glory and whiskey...

822
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:42,625
或许只是在思考要如何败阵吧
...probably deciding how you could lose.

823
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:47,463
你凭什么知道这么多你怎么清楚他心里在想什么？
What makes you know so much? How do you know what he was thinking?

824
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:49,715
我知道
l know.

825
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,385
我就在现场
Been there myself.

826
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,014
我们都在现场，可不是，派克小姐？
We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?

827
01:38:58,307 --> 01:38:59,976
有火柴吗？
Got a match?

828
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:07,191
戈登先生，你的打火机不能用吗？
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?

829
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,402
全忘光了
l forgot all about it.

830
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:13,030
- 你的手好些了吗？  - 还好
- How is your hand?  - Fine.

831
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:16,117
那就好，我可不想把钱交给伤残人士
Good. l'd hate to put my money on a cripple.

832
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:21,539
- 你怎么可以说这种话？  - 我知道戈登先生绝无恶意
- Why did you say a thing like that?  - l'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense.

833
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,625
那不过是一种措词
lt was a figure of speech.

834
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:28,463
- 说得好，派克小姐  - 事实就是事实嘛
- That's right, Miss Packard.  - A fact is a fact.

835
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:32,884
艾迪，她是个伶俐的女子
She's a smart girl, Eddie.

836
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:57,950
戈登先生，这边请，到了，戈登先生，56号房
Right this way, Mr. Gordon. Here you are, Mr. Gordon, Suite 56.

837
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,828
我预先打过电报订两间相邻的套房
l wired ahead for two suites adjoining.

838
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,080
- 我不记得了  - 我记得！我要两间套房
- l don't recall.  - l do! l want two suites.

839
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,625
对不起，全都客满，刚好德比周嘛
l'm sorry, we're filled up, this is Derby week.

840
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,793
错在你，你一定收到我的电报
You're wrong, you must've gotten my wire.

841
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:11,088
- 查阅你们的订房记录  - 我来看看有什么办法
- Look through your reservations.  - l'll see what l can do.

842
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:16,052
戈登先生，你是对的，我放错你的电报了，两间相邻套房？
Yes, you're right, Mr. Gordon. l mislaid your wire. Two adjoining suites?

843
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,142
弹子房

844
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:34,028
这弹子房里音乐真棒，你几乎可以闻到热闹的钱味
That's sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money.

845
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:37,198
我从头到脚都可以感觉，这种气氛
l can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.

846
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,076
- 艾迪！  - 比利，你好啊
- Eddie!  - Billy, how are you?

847
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:44,580
不知道你在这儿，人人都来这儿了，真像个老千大集会！
l didn't know you were here. Everyone's here. lt's like a hustlers' convention!

848
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:49,335
西石小子，巨无霸强尼，来来，大家会很高兴看到你们
West Stone Kid, Johnny Jumbo. Come in, the guys will be glad to see you.

849
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,297
- 我们在哪一间？  - 57号
- What room are we in?  - 57.

850
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,007
我稍后就来
l'll be up later.

851
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,841
派克小姐，请稍候
Wait, Miss Packard.

852
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,177
我们现在是邻居了，叫我莎拉吧
We're neighbors, now. Call me Sarah.

853
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,055
我想跟你谈谈
l want to talk to you.

854
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,308
需要吗？
Do we need words?

855
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:49,437
我想是的，我们恐怕会彼此伤感情，这样对大家都不好…
l think so. We could cut each other up, but that'd be bad for everybody...

856
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,898
对我、对你，尤其是对艾迪
...for me, for you, and worst of all for Eddie.

857
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,818
你知道什么对他是有利的
You know what's good for him.

858
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:57,612
赢钱啊
To win.

859
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,822
为谁赢，为什么要赢？
For whom and for what?

860
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,744
是什么东西让世界运转的金钱和荣耀嘛
What makes the world go around? For money and for glory.

861
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:08,205
请回答我第一个问题，为谁赢？
Answer my first question. For whom?

862
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,958
今日为我，明日为他自己
Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

863
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,377
对你而言没有明日
There is no tomorrow with you.

864
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:17,423
你拥有全部的明天，因为今天你全买了，廉价！
You own all the tomorrows, because you buy them today, cheap.

865
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,719
不用卖出
Nobody has to sell.

866
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,348
- 你混球…  - 瓢虫小姐！
- You bastard--  - Miss Ladybird!

867
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:30,436
我知道你以延期特价优惠票来了这儿，凭手腕紧抓不放
You are here on a rain check, and l know it. Hanging on by your nails.

868
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,438
你让荣耀的哨子为艾迪而吹…
You let that glory whistle blow for Eddie...

869
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:35,566
而你却是路旁破车的残骸，老朽的马匹
...and you're a wreck on the track, a horse that finished last.

870
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,779
瓢虫小姐，别再惹麻烦了，自在过活，也放人一马吧！
Don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live!

871
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,615
趁现在还不迟
While you can.

872
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:49,288
我会帮你安排的
l'll make it up to you.

873
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:52,917
如何做？
How?

874
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:56,587
告诉我吧
You tell me.

875
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,156
谢了
Thanks.

876
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,619
下一场比赛中，有三匹马淘汰出局…
There are three late scratches in the following race:

877
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:32,331
迷迭香、幸运之神，及L与R
Rosemary, Stroke of Luck, and L & R.

878
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:36,710
- 巴特在哪儿？  - 不知道去哪儿了
- Where's Bert?  - He went off somewhere.

879
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:38,796
那匹可爱的马赌注有22.4元
That old loving horse paid $22.40!

880
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:43,676
昨晚我赌那个赛马骑师，赢了两百元，今天这一跑道我有540元
With the $200 l won from that jockey last night, and today at the track, l've $540.

881
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,846
- 呐，你拿着  - 为什么？
- Here, you hold it.  - Why?

882
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,264
讨个吉利嘛
Just for luck.

883
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,769
- 芬德利来了  - 在哪？
- Findley's here.  - Where?

884
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,439
在吧台旁边
Over there by the bar.

885
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:08,033
- 你不是要去和他说话吗？  - 别急，他会过来
- Aren't you going to talk to him?  - Sit tight. He'll be over here.

886
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,457
- 还要吗？  - 谢了
- You ready for another?  - Thank you.

887
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:16,167
我不要了
No more for me.

888
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:20,880
嗨，好久不见
Hello. l haven't seen you in a long time.

889
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:24,091
我好久没来这儿了
l haven't been here for a long time.

890
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:29,013
派克小姐、艾迪富森、詹拇士…
Miss Packard, Eddie Felson. James....

891
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,431
芬德利
Findley.

892
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,850
- 很高兴见到你  - 我也是
- Glad to meet you.  - And l, you.

893
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:37,688
富森先生，久仰大名，您玩落袋撞球，是吧？
l think l've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?

894
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:43,486
- 偶尔啦，你玩吗？  - 很少，不过几乎每玩必输
- Now and then. Why? Do you?  - A little, but l'm afraid l generally lose.

895
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,446
艾迪也是
So does Eddie.

896
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:52,453
- 我有时赢  - 富森先生，我敢打赌你都赢
- l win sometimes.  - l bet you do, Mr. Felson. l just bet you do.

897
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,663
你要玩多少钱？
How much?

898
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,209
巴特？
Bert?

899
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,337
我相信富森先生，是在提议来赌一场
l believe Mr. Felson is making a proposition.

900
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,630
有可能
Could be.

901
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:04,632
嗯，富森先生…
Well, Mr. Felson...

902
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:08,385
或许哪一天你愿意大驾光临寒舍，我们来打打撞球
...maybe you'd like to come to my place sometime. We can play billiards.

903
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,678
何时？
When?

904
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:13,557
- 你真爽快  - 没错，何时？
- You're very direct.  - That's right. When?

905
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,894
- 今晚吗？  - 几点？
- Tonight?  - What time?

906
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,814
赛马一结束，有些朋友，要来我家喝点小酒
l'm having some people for drinks right after the races.

907
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,985
何不大家都来十点左右我们就可以玩了
Why don't you all come? Then about 10:00 we can play.

908
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:26,987
- 我们会来  - 好极了
- We'll be there.  - Good.

909
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,247
你不介意的话，我想留在饭店里
lf you don't mind, l think l will stay at the hotel.

910
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,457
- 怎么啦？  - 我很累
- What's the matter?  - l'm tired.

911
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:41,752
得了吧，一定笑话百出，芬德利的派对挺有名的
Come on, it'll be a lot of laughs. Findley's parties are famous.

912
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:46,799
他不但广邀上流社会人士，连城里的三教九流也照邀不误
He invites everybody from high society to every tramp in town.

913
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,884
这是他另外一种娱乐方式
Another way he gets his kicks.

914
01:45:48,968 --> 01:45:53,556
他与黑白两道都称兄道弟，有些男人就是这样
lt excites him to be around the criminal type. Some men are like that.

915
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,058
有些女人也照做不误
Some women, too.

916
01:48:15,572 --> 01:48:18,659
- 怎么回事？  - 没事，她喝多了
- What's the matter?  - lt's all right. She drank too much.

917
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:21,495
让她睡，睡醒酒也醒了
Let her sleep it off.

918
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:23,038
住口！
Cut it out!

919
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:25,290
照他说的去做吧，来来，上楼
Do what he says, come on, upstairs.

920
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:38,280
各位男士，想喝点什么吗？
Do you gentlemen care for a drink?

921
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:41,700
- 我不用了，咱就来玩吧  - 当然
- None for me. Let's play.  - By all means.

922
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:49,458
我们来这儿玩落袋撞球是吧？
Thought we came here to play pool?

923
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:53,128
我打弹子，不玩落袋撞球
l don't play pool, l play billiards.

924
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,384
这儿是我家，高兴玩什么就玩什么，不想玩的就别玩吧
lt's my house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.

925
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,471
- 我们不玩  - 巴特，让我来陪他玩
- We won't.  - Bert, let me play him.

926
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:08,143
- 赌注多少？  - 我们先玩小的，一百元一局好吗？
- How much?  - We'll start small. $100 a game?

927
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:11,563
- 你以前打过弹子吗？  - 当然
- Did you ever play billiards before?  - Sure.

928
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:13,690
你在唬我？
You hustling me?

929
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:19,196
他明白自己在做什么，你出一百元开始玩就知道了
l'm sure he knows what he's doing. You can afford $100 to find out.

930
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,282
发牌
Deal the cards.

931
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:52,271
射得好富森先生，你从前打过弹子嘛
Beautiful shot! You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson.

932
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:56,441
- 你确定不来一杯？  - 我不用
- Sure you wouldn't care for a drink?  - Nothing for me.

933
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,738
目前比数如何？
How do we stand?

934
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:03,866
- 几乎平手  - 我何时提高赌注？
- About even.  - When do l raise the bet?

935
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:06,743
- 不清楚  - 如果这是他的拿手戏，我会击败他
- l don't know.  - lf that's his best game, l can beat him.

936
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,996
告诉我实话，你打过弹子吗？
Level with me. Did you ever play billiards?

937
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,455
有什么不同？
What's the difference?

938
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:14,585
球台上有球杆，一些小球，你所需要的就是感觉
There's a cue, balls on the table. All you got to do is get the feel of it.

939
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:17,963
- 要不要提高赌注？  - 多少？
- Shall we raise the stakes?  - How much?

940
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:19,882
五百元？
$500?

941
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:21,383
你以为能击败他吗？
You think you can beat him?

942
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:24,511
当然他行，他若不行就不会和我对战
Of course he does. He wouldn't play me if he didn't.

943
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:28,307
我没问他能不能击败你，我早已知道他能
l didn't ask him, can he beat you, l already know he can.

944
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:31,977
我问了他，行吗那是两码子事
l asked him, will he? That's two different things.

945
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,395
我能击败他
l can beat him.

946
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:35,814
好，五百
All right, $500.

947
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:42,362
巴特，你注意到了吗这家伙跟你倒有几分神似呢
Have you noticed, Bert, this fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you?

948
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,908
你好像当时就是，这尊雕像的模特儿
lt seems you might have modeled for the artist.

949
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,995
有可能喔
lt's possible.

950
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,131
巴特，也把那标示出来
Mark that one up, too, Bert.

951
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,884
下一局我就要击败他
l'll beat him the next game.

952
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:08,722
你的手状况怎样了？
How are the hands?

953
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,308
还好
Fine.

954
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,894
球杆收了，咱要走人了
Rack up your cue, we're leaving.

955
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:18,106
- 这样没面子，还早呢  - 这一晚已玩够两千元了
- That's a shame. The night is young.  - The night is $2,000 old.

956
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,651
- 嘿，巴特，等等  - 我说过该走了
- Hey, Bert, wait.  - l said we're leaving.

957
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:35,874
巴特，我能击败他
l can beat him, Bert.

958
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:40,629
他耍我，我以为他不会使诈，我能赢过他，击败他
He suckered me, l didn't think he knew how to hustle. l can outplay and beat him!

959
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:44,341
艾迪，我不相信，我觉得你还是个输家
l don't believe you, Eddie. l think you're still a loser.

960
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:49,596
我要拿自己的钱迎战他！
l'll play him on my own money!

961
01:52:51,723 --> 01:52:53,100
现在就走！
Be right back.

962
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:25,465
算了吧，再战一回
Okay, come on, let's play.

963
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,264
我破产了
l'm broke.

964
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:36,059
- 富森先生，真不幸  - 芬德利先生，对谁不幸？
- That's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.  - For whom, Mr. Findley?

965
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,645
巴特，他只赢我一分
Bert, he only beat me by a point.

966
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:42,107
- 银行打烊了  - 别弃我而去，拜托！
- The bank is closed.  - Don't get off me, please!

967
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:45,277
我知道何时该罢手，你却不能，输或赢你都无法掌握！
l know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know!

968
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,279
你要我怎样？说出来…
What do you want me to do? Say it...

969
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:49,156
这就对了，但现在不要丢下我
...and you've got it, but don't get off me now.

970
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:50,782
别求他
Don't beg him.

971
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:56,330
- 回饭店去  - 艾迪，请别求他
- Go back to the hotel.  - Please, Eddie, don't beg him.

972
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,624
回饭店去，叫一辆车回去！
Go back to the hotel. Take a cab, go back!

973
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:06,298
这一切不都是如你所料这样对你有何意义？
Doesn't all this come through to you? Doesn't it mean anything to you?

974
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,384
那家伙，此地，这票人
That man, this place, the people.

975
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:14,598
他们都戴假面具，面具底下，个个都是堕落的、扭曲的、残缺的
They wear masks, and under them they're perverted, twisted, crippled!

976
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,893
- 闭嘴  - 别戴面具了，你不需要
- Shut up.  - Don't wear a mask. You don't have to.

977
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,104
那是特克，扭伤你拇指的家伙！
That's Turk, who broke your thumbs!

978
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:24,941
他不会再扭伤你的拇指，而是要剁碎你的心，搅碎你的肠…
He won't break your thumbs, he'll break your heart, your guts...

979
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:29,446
而且，还为了相同的理由：，为了“你就是你”而憎恨你
...and for the same reason, because he hates you for what you are.

980
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,658
- 为了你有的，而他所没有  - 别再对我说教，永远别再叨念了
- For what you have and he hasn't.  - Get off my back, once and for all!

981
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,869
不要再烦我好吗？
Would you get off my back?

982
01:54:42,584 --> 01:54:44,002
艾迪，迎战
Play him, Eddie.

983
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:47,672
一局下注一千元迎战他
Play him for $1,000 a game.

984
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:25,085
支票可以吗？
Will you take a check?

985
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,341
现金
Cash.

986
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,430
我欠你多少钱？
How much do l owe you?

987
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,557
一万二
$12,000.

988
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,291
呐，给你
Here.

989
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,379
真有趣的夜晚
lt's been an interesting evening.

990
01:56:13,758 --> 01:56:15,051
确是
lt sure has.

991
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:18,597
查尔斯，请帮这几位男士叫一辆，出租车
Charles, call a cab for these gentlemen, please.

992
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:23,435
- 应该送你们到门口，可是…  - 是啊，你累了
- l'd show you to the door, but--  - Yes, you're tired.

993
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:26,563
也打败了
And beat.

994
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:29,941
嗯
Yeah.

995
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:35,280
一定要再来喔
You must come again.

996
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:38,992
当然
Yeah, sure.

997
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:53,256
这是你那一份：三千元
Here's your share: $3,000.

998
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:57,385
- 车在等了  - 谢了
- The cab is waiting.  - Thanks.

999
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:02,098
- 艾迪，咱们走  - 我想走路
- Eddie, let's go.  - l want to walk.

1000
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,393
走路太远了
lt's a long walk.

1001
01:57:05,477 --> 01:57:07,103
巴特，有的是时间
l got time, Bert.

1002
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:10,232
你要我替你向她转达吗？
You want me to tell her for you?

1003
01:57:10,607 --> 01:57:12,108
转达什么？
Tell her what?

1004
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:14,945
艾迪，心肠要硬一点
You got to be hard, Eddie.

1005
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:37,861
你何时要走？
When are you leaving?

1006
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:41,239
一下子，这是你要我做的，对吗？
ln a little while. lt's what you want, isn't it?

1007
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,284
是艾迪要你做的
lt's what Eddie wants.

1008
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:49,539
他要我给你一些钱
He told me to give you some money.

1009
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:55,712
放床上吧，事情都是这么解决的，可不是？
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?

1010
01:58:58,089 --> 01:59:00,216
事情都是这么解决
That's the way it's done.

1011
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:02,927
你看着我的那种眼神…
The way you're looking at me...

1012
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:06,348
就是每次你击败一个男子时，所投射的眼神吗？
...is that how you look at a man you've just beaten?

1013
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:12,312
就好像你才刚拿了他的钱，马上又要他的尊严？
As if you've just taken his money and now you want his pride?

1014
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:16,566
- 我所要的不过就是钱  - 当然
- All l want is the money.  - Sure.

1015
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:22,447
当然，钱和看见这个人崩溃的乐趣
Sure, the money and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart.

1016
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:27,160
巴特，你有罗马式的精神，应该所战皆赢
You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.

1017
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:13,373
有饮料吗？
You got a drink?

1018
02:00:34,811 --> 02:00:39,482
堕落

1019
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:48,158
扭曲（艾迪）

1020
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:53,872
残缺

1021
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,799
请给我57号房的钥匙
Give me my key, please. Room 57.

1022
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:10,096
快啦，给我钥匙
Come on, give me my key.

1023
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:38,833
来，咱们回想一下，你说你在另一间房间…
Now, let's go over this again. You say you were in the other room....

1024
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:42,420
她关上门，我告诉过你，她关上了门
She closed the door, l told you, she closed the door.

1025
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:46,174
她关上门，进入浴室，待了五或十分钟左右
She closed the door, went in there, maybe ten, five minutes or so.

1026
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:51,846
嘿，让他进来
Hey, let him come in.

1027
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:58,686
艾迪…
Eddie....

1028
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:28,299
艾迪？
Eddie?

1029
02:02:32,053 --> 02:02:33,263
艾迪？
Eddie?

1030
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:42,105
她进来这儿，艾迪
She came in here, Eddie.

1031
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,774
要我给她酒
She asked me for a drink.

1032
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:46,859
我给了她一杯
l gave her one.

1033
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,113
后来我们又多喝了几杯
We had a few more.

1034
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,784
艾迪，她进来过这儿！
Eddie, she came in here!

1035
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,375
肥子，我来打撞球
l came to play pool, Fats.

1036
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:34,676
- 好啊，赌注多少？  - 任你说
- That's good. For how much?  - You name it.

1037
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:38,304
一局一千？
$1,000 a game?

1038
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:41,057
肥子，我们来玩一局三千吧
Let's make it $3,000 a game, Fats.

1039
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:46,104
三千？那是我的资金，全部家当啊
$3,000, that's my bankroll, my life savings.

1040
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:50,733
肥子，怎么回事？
What's the matter, Fats?

1041
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:54,362
第一场打败我吧，我就回奥克兰了
Beat me the first game, and l'm on my way back to Oakland.

1042
02:04:58,408 --> 02:04:59,701
走吧
Let's go.

1043
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:10,378
巴特，赌我吧，我不能再输！
Get on me, Bert, l can't lose!

1044
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:15,049
威利？
Willie?

1045
02:05:24,308 --> 02:05:26,102
- 出球  - 杆头
- Call it.  - Heads.

1046
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:17,195
巴特，这球要怎么打出？
How should l play that one, Bert?

1047
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:19,155
安全地打出？
Play it safe?

1048
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:24,076
你总是教我要安全地打出，精算百分比
That's what you always told me, play it safe, play the percentage.

1049
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,370
嗯，就这样，精准漂亮
Well, here we go, fast and loose.

1050
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,539
一球，角袋
One ball, corner pocket.

1051
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:33,169
精准的球员也可能死得很惨，可不是吗，巴特？
Percentage players die broke, too, don't they, Bert?

1052
02:06:42,637 --> 02:06:44,222
我怎能输球？
How can l lose?

1053
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:47,225
十二号球
Twelve ball.

1054
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:55,191
我是说，我怎能输球因为，巴特你对了
l mean, how can l lose? Because you were right, Bert.

1055
02:06:57,568 --> 02:07:02,323
光有才华不够，还需要具备特色
lt's not enough to have talent, you've got to have character, too.

1056
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:03,866
四号球
Four ball.

1057
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,710
当然现在我有些特色了
And l sure got character now.

1058
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:18,548
我在路易斯维尔的饭店里揣摩来的
l picked it up in a hotel room in Louisville.

1059
02:07:21,676 --> 02:07:23,511
射球，刽子手艾迪
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

1060
02:07:25,012 --> 02:07:27,890
肥子，我是在射球，我失手了，就换你射
l'm shooting pool, Fats. When l miss, you can shoot.

1061
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:35,022
五号球
Five ball.

1062
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:41,612
十四号球
Fourteen ball.

1063
02:07:47,159 --> 02:07:48,578
四号球
Four ball.

1064
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:54,834
好赛局
That's game.

1065
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:08,264
好精采！
Game!

1066
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:22,862
八号球
Eight ball.

1067
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:40,922
十三号球
Thirteen ball.

1068
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,649
艾迪，我叫停
l quit, Eddie.

1069
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,652
我无法击败你
l can't beat you.

1070
02:09:04,612 --> 02:09:06,822
威利，给他赌注
Willie, give him the stake.

1071
02:09:10,451 --> 02:09:12,411
你让自己成了撞球高手
You got yourself a pool player.

1072
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,664
爱说教的，外套给我
Preacher, give me my coat.

1073
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,836
你想去哪儿？
Where do you think you're going?

1074
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:24,840
艾迪？
Eddie?

1075
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:29,345
你欠我钱！
You owe me money!

1076
02:09:33,933 --> 02:09:36,477
就看你怎么算，巴特？
Just how do you figure that, Bert?

1077
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:42,692
- 照你算，我欠你多少？  - 一半！
- What do you figure l owe you?  - Half!

1078
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:46,487
- 在路易斯维尔，应该七成五  - 拿去，一半
- ln Louisville, it was 75%.  - Here, it's half.

1079
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,956
我不付给你的话呢？
What if l don't pay you?

1080
02:10:01,043 --> 02:10:02,545
你不付给我？
You don't pay me?

1081
02:10:04,547 --> 02:10:06,841
你的拇指就得再扭伤一次
You'll get your thumbs broken again.

1082
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:11,554
加上其他手指
And your fingers.

1083
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:17,977
如果我要他们做，他们就会分三四次，把你的右臂扭断
lf l want them to, they'll break your right arm in three or four places.

1084
02:10:19,562 --> 02:10:21,022
艾迪，你最好给他
You better pay him, Eddie.

1085
02:10:36,328 --> 02:10:38,581
你自认为还是我的经纪人吗？
You figure you're still my manager?

1086
02:10:38,873 --> 02:10:40,583
兄弟，我在商言商啊
l'm a businessman, kid.

1087
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:43,252
你已经给我排满了赌局？
You've got a lot of games lined up for me?

1088
02:10:43,377 --> 02:10:45,755
现在开始，我们要一起大捞一票
We'll make lots of money together, from now on.

1089
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,381
五五对分？
50%?

1090
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:51,093
未必要五五对分，也可以七成或七成五
lt don't have to be 50%. lt can be 30%, 25%.

1091
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:02,104
我们着实教训了她一顿，可不是？
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we?

1092
02:11:03,564 --> 02:11:05,566
真的够狠的一招
We really gave it to her good.

1093
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:09,111
若不是在路易斯维尔，也会在其他地方发生
lf it didn't happen in Louisville, it would happen someplace else.

1094
02:11:09,195 --> 02:11:13,032
若不是现在，就是六个月后，她一向是那种贵妇人
lf not now, six months from now. That's the kind of dame she was.

1095
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:15,284
然后咱们就扭曲了它，可不是？
Then we twisted it, didn't we, Bert?

1096
02:11:16,869 --> 02:11:21,582
那档子事儿没把你撂倒，因为你能慧剑斩情丝！
lt doesn't stick in your throat because you spit it out like everything else!

1097
02:11:25,044 --> 02:11:26,754
可是我真的为她难过
But it sticks in mine.

1098
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:30,758
我爱她
l loved her.

1099
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:35,805
我在一场赌战中把她给折价卖了
l traded her in on a pool game.

1100
02:11:37,807 --> 02:11:42,561
这对你无关紧要的啦，你在乎过谁啊？
That wouldn't mean anything to you. Who did you ever care about?

1101
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:46,398
你说过只要赢就好，赌赢是一切
''Just win,'' you said. That's the important thing.

1102
02:11:46,774 --> 02:11:49,652
你不知道真赢是什么，你是输家！
You don't know what winning is. You're a loser!

1103
02:11:50,277 --> 02:11:53,322
因为你内心已死，除非你能让周遭一切事物…
Because you're dead inside, and you can't live...

1104
02:11:53,406 --> 02:11:56,325
也枯槁，否则你就活不下去
...unless you make everything else dead around you.

1105
02:11:57,493 --> 02:11:58,911
太高了，巴特
Too high, Bert.

1106
02:12:00,162 --> 02:12:02,164
你的代价太高
Your price is too high.

1107
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:07,837
假如我接受，她活不下去，也死不了
lf l take it, she never lived. She never died.

1108
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:15,511
我们都知道不是这样的，可不是她活过，也死了
We both know that's not true, don't we? She lived. She died.

1109
02:12:21,142 --> 02:12:22,643
你最好是…
You better....

1110
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:28,023
你最好叫你那票人把我杀了，最好把我一了百了…
You tell your boys they better kill me. They better go all the way with me...

1111
02:12:28,649 --> 02:12:32,862
因为如果只是把我揍成碎片，我会自己黏合起来…
...because if they just bust me up, l'll put the pieces together...

1112
02:12:34,238 --> 02:12:36,157
所以神啊，救救我，巴特
...so help me God, Bert...

1113
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:39,493
我会再回来、杀了你
...l'll come back and l'll kill you.

1114
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,079
等等
Wait a minute.

1115
02:12:49,837 --> 02:12:51,046
好吧
All right.

1116
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:10,065
不过…
Only...

1117
02:13:14,695 --> 02:13:17,781
千万不要再踏进，高档的赌场一步
...don't ever walk into a big-time pool hall again.

1118
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:29,877
肥子…
Fat Man...

1119
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:33,047
你狠耍了一招诈赌
...you shoot a great game of pool.

1120
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:35,299
彼此彼此，刽子手艾迪
So do you, Fast Eddie.
