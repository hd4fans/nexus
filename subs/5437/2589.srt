1
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,959
- Yes, sir.
- l got a little grease in this lining.

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,088
lt'll take a half-hour to check it.
You want me to fill her up, too?

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,007
- You better check the oil, too.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,221
- You boys just passing through?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,224
Pittsburgh? Coming in or going out?

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:02,145
- Going in, to a sales convention tomorrow.
- What do you guys sell?

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,065
We sell drug supplies.
He is going to get an award.

8
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,239
He sold $17,000 worth last month.
Fastest boy in the territory.

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,241
Yeah. Fastest and the ''bestest.''

10
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,161
- Another round, one for him and yourself.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,415
Sure is a hot day for driving.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,461
Late afternoon is better.
You have plenty of time.

13
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,756
You can make Pittsburgh
in two or three hours.

14
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,092
He's right.

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,347
What do you say, Charlie?

16
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,350
Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?

17
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,269
lt'll cost you money. Always does.

18
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,480
Come on, stop stalling.
Grab yourself a cue.

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,483
Good thing he can afford it.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,154
Keep them coming. J.T.S. Brown.

21
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,386
You miss again, you lose again.

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,267
What is the kid in hock for so far?

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,269
About $60, $70.

24
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,230
Next game, $10.

25
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,778
Nice looking boy, clean-cut.
lt's too bad he can't hold his liquor.

26
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:01,056
l made it, boy! l finally made it!
Come on, pay up, pay up, sucker!

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,768
You ought to shoot craps with that luck!

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,397
- What do you mean, luck?
- You know what l mean.

29
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,109
You couldn't make that shot again
in a million years.

30
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,406
l couldn't? Okay, set them up
the way they were before.

31
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,159
- Why?
- Set them up the way they were before.

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,539
l'll bet you $20 that l make that shot
the same way again.

33
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,126
Nobody can make that shot,
not even a lucky lush.

34
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,803
How is that?

35
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,766
- ls that the way they were before?
- Yeah, that's it.

36
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,685
Come on, put it up.

37
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,374
Set them up again.

38
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,463
Come on, set them up again.

39
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,799
You're drunk, boy.
l'm not betting you anymore.

40
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,676
What do you mean?

41
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,681
Let's leave. We have to be
at that convention in the morning.

42
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:30,187
Up the flagpole with the convention!
Come on, l got my money on the table.

43
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,856
- l don't want it.
- l'll try you.

44
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,911
Don't be a chump. Don't bet
any more money on that damn fool shot!

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,291
You figure l'm a little drunk,
l'm loaded on hemp...

46
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,879
...and you just want in real friendly
while the money's still floating?

47
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,716
Okay.

48
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,096
Go ahead. Set them up.

49
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:22,364
You want some easy money? Here's $105.
One week's commission.

50
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,744
You want to take the whole thing?
Then you get a crack at your easy money.

51
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,038
- l'll take a piece of that action.
- Me, too.

52
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,542
- No, l want him!
- l'll take it out of the till.

53
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,213
l'll meet you in the car, chump!

54
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
'Morning, Henry.

55
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,019
Quiet.

56
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,399
Yeah, like a church.

57
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,073
The Church of the Good Hustler.

58
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:57,120
lt looks like a morgue to me. Those tables
are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.

59
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,875
l'll be alive when l get out.

60
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,309
- Any table?
- Any table.

61
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,191
No bar?

62
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:31,112
No bar, no pinball machines,
no bowling alleys, just pool. Nothing else.

63
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
This is Ames, mister.

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
''This is Ames, mister.''

65
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,743
Nice, clean pocket-drop.

66
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,890
How much am l going to win tonight?

67
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,942
$10,000.
l'm going to win $10,000 in one night.

68
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,116
Who's going to beat me?

69
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,454
Come on, Charlie.
Who's going to beat me?

70
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,416
Okay, nobody can beat you.

71
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,046
$10,000!

72
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:17,969
What other poolroom is there
where a guy can win $10,000 in one night?

73
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,851
l can remember hustling an old man
for a dime a game.

74
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,646
- We got company.
- Are you looking for action?

75
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,734
- Maybe. Want to play?
- No, hell, no.

76
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,820
- Are you Eddie Felson?
- Who's he?

77
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,033
- What's your game? What do you shoot?
- You name it, we shoot it.

78
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,951
Friend, l'm not trying to hustle.

79
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,748
l never hustle people that bring
in leather satchels. Don't hustle me.

80
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,881
l'm Eddie Felson. l shoot straight pool.
Got any straight pool shooters here?

81
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,843
- What straight pool game do you like?
- The expensive kind.

82
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,555
You came to play pool
with Minnesota Fats?

83
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,892
That's right.

84
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,022
- Want some free advice?
- How much will it cost?

85
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,567
Who are you, his manager,
friend, his stooge?

86
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,486
He's my partner.

87
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,114
- Well-heeled partner?
- We got enough.

88
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,078
Take the boy home. Fats doesn't need
your money. You can't beat him.

89
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,207
No one's beaten him in 15 years.
He's the best in the country.

90
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,794
You got that wrong, mister. l am.

91
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:39,258
Okay, l told you about Minnesota Fats.
You just go ahead and play him, friend.

92
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,552
Tell me where l can find him, friend.

93
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,181
He comes in this poolroom every night
at 8:00 on the nose.

94
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,517
Stay here, he'll find you.

95
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,066
- You shoot a good stick.
- Thank you.

96
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,987
- Do you shoot straight pool, mister?
- Now and then, you know how it is.

97
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,077
You're Minnesota Fats, aren't you?

98
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,958
They say you're the best in the country,
where l come from.

99
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,587
ls that a fact?

100
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,549
They say that old Fats
shoots the eyes off them balls.

101
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,720
- Where are you from?
- California. Oakland.

102
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,892
California. ls your name Felson?
Eddie Felson?

103
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,894
That's right.

104
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,355
l hear you've been looking for me.

105
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,525
Yeah, that's right, too.

106
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,822
Big John,
do you think this boy is a hustler?

107
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,165
Do you like to gamble?
Gamble money on pool games?

108
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,919
Let's shoot a game of straight pool.

109
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,297
$100?

110
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:28,428
You shoot bigtime pool.
Everyone says you shoot bigtime pool.

111
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,390
Let's make it $200 a game.

112
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,814
Now l know why they call you
''Fast Eddie.'' You talk my kind of talk.

113
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,484
Sausage, rack them up!

114
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,063
- How do you feel?
- Fast and loose, man.

115
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,982
ln the gut, l mean?

116
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
Tight but good.

117
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,594
Willie, hang on to that.

118
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,994
You break.

119
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,935
l didn't leave you much.

120
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,238
You left enough.

121
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,866
Six in the corner.

122
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,591
Fifteen, in the corner.

123
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,850
Ace, in the side.

124
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,524
Eight.

125
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,576
Ten.

126
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,043
Eleven.

127
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,798
He is great! That old fat man.

128
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,968
Look how he moves. Like a dancer!

129
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,845
Twelve, cross-eyed.

130
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,474
And those fingers, them chubby fingers...

131
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,934
...and that stroke...

132
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,730
- ...like he's playing a violin.
- Five ball.

133
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,067
Eight ball.

134
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
Four long.

135
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,090
Cross corner.

136
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,099
Nice shot.

137
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,105
Safe.

138
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,621
Safe.

139
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,472
Seven ball in the corner.

140
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,821
Six in the corner.

141
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,033
One twenty-five, game.

142
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,660
Thirteen.

143
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,204
Five.

144
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,999
Ten.

145
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,668
Game!

146
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,757
Two in the corner.

147
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,884
Thirteen.

148
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,888
One twenty-five, game.

149
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,605
Ace in the corner.

150
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,943
Three ball.

151
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,029
Quit. He's too good.

152
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,534
l'm going to take him!

153
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,870
Your shot.

154
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,372
You miss?

155
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,632
You don't leave much when you miss,
do you?

156
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,259
That's what the game's all about.

157
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,058
Two ball, side pocket.

158
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,649
Very good shot.

159
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,153
l have a hunch, Fat Man,
it's me from here on in.

160
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,490
One ball, corner pocket.

161
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,412
Did that ever happen to you?
Suddenly you feel like you can't miss?

162
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,170
l've dreamed about this game,
Fat Man, every night on the road.

163
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,422
Five ball.

164
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,594
This is my table, man, l own it!

165
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,805
Fifteen ball.

166
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,975
Seven ball.

167
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,936
Four ball.

168
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,313
Game!

169
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,198
Eleven ball.

170
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,743
Rack them!

171
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,996
Ten ball in the corner.

172
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,047
One ball in the corner pocket.

173
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,468
Game!

174
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,187
Pay the man again, Fats.

175
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:35,914
- How much are we ahead?
- Approximately $1,000.

176
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,378
Fats, let's shoot for $1,000 a game.

177
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,391
Get me some White Tavern whiskey,
a glass and some ice.

178
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:59,563
Preacher, get me some bourbon.
J.T.S. Brown, no ice, no glass.

179
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,110
Get it at Johnny's.

180
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,238
You got a bet.

181
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,645
Cash me in.

182
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,989
Two in the corner.

183
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,536
Seven.

184
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,501
Ace in the corner.

185
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,763
Two ball, side pocket.

186
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,326
One twenty-five, game.

187
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,911
Ten ball.

188
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,710
Will you cut that sunshine out?

189
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,325
Hey, mister.

190
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,287
- The name's Gordon, Bert Gordon.
- Mister!

191
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,708
You've been sitting in that spot for hours.
Would you move? lt bothers me.

192
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,681
Five ball.

193
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,395
That's game.

194
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:17,719
- How much we got?
- We have $1 1,400 cash, in my pocket.

195
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,477
Preacher, get me some breakfast.
An egg sandwich and coffee.

196
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,187
You want something, Charlie?

197
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:32,317
Wait. You're coming with me to eat
at the hotel. The pool game is over.

198
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,823
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The game is over when Fats says so.

199
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,701
You wanted $10,000, you got it.

200
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,620
- Get with it, will you, Charlie?
- Get with what?

201
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:50,169
You can't see it, can you, Charlie?
You never have. l came after him.

202
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,797
And l'm going to get him.

203
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,966
l'm going with him all the way.

204
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,012
The game is not over until Fats says so.
ls it over, Fats?

205
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,608
l'll beat him, mister. l beat him all night
and l'll beat him all day.

206
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:30,751
l'm the best you've ever seen, Fats.
Even if you beat me l'm still the best.

207
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,341
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.

208
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,726
What did he say?

209
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:58,028
Twenty-five hours. For twenty-five hours
you've been playing straight.

210
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,200
- Get me a drink, will you?
- You don't need a drink.

211
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,409
Shut up!

212
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,039
Just get me a drink!

213
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,445
$18,000, Eddie! We're ahead $18,000!

214
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,262
l thought this game was over
when Fats said it was.

215
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,264
No. lt's over now.

216
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,227
Fast Eddie, let's play some pool.

217
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,397
Let's go, Eddie.

218
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,783
You look beautiful, Fats.

219
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:14,122
Just like a baby, all pink and powdered up.

220
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,810
What are you trying to do, Eddie?
You beat him bad. Want to kill yourself?

221
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,064
- Are you chicken, Charlie?
- Maybe that's it. l'm chicken.

222
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,733
Go home. Just leave me the money.

223
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,402
Go to hell!

224
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,160
Give me that money!

225
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,498
Come on now. Give it to me. lt is mine!

226
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,130
Here. Be a damn fool!

227
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,367
You really look beautiful, Fats.

228
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,400
l'll break.

229
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,586
Nine ball.

230
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,219
Fifteen.

231
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,349
One twenty-five.

232
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,026
Wake up, Eddie.

233
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,288
We lose again.

234
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,661
ls this all we have left?

235
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,456
lf that's all you got, that's all we got left.

236
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,295
Willie, give me the stake money.

237
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,638
l have about $200 here.

238
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,849
The game is over, Eddie.

239
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,691
Fats, l got about $200 here.
You can't run out on me.

240
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,361
Watch me.

241
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,182
Fats, come on.

242
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,578
l'm sorry, Charlie.

243
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,007
Give me a towel, will you?

244
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,182
Are you sure?

245
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,437
Can l get you something?

246
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,439
Later.

247
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,329
A long wait for a bus?

248
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,831
Yes.

249
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,876
How long have you been waiting?

250
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,503
What?

251
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,630
How long have you been waiting?

252
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,049
Since 4:00.

253
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,430
Just a cup of black coffee, please.

254
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,726
Ma'am, wait a minute.

255
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,228
Would you like another cup?

256
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,315
All right. Thanks.

257
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,695
What time does the bus leave?

258
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,531
What bus?

259
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,199
Your bus.

260
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,452
8:00.

261
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,711
That wouldn't give us much time.

262
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,050
You're right.

263
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,478
Hello and goodbye.

264
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,871
Have a nice trip.

265
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,043
Thanks. l will.

266
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,636
Give it to me.

267
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,975
- How much do l owe you?
- lt was paid for by the lady.

268
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,652
- Give me some bourbon, J.T.S. Brown.
- Sure.

269
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,657
- Want a chaser?
- No.

270
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,342
Did you have a nice trip?

271
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,136
Fair.

272
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,889
May l sit down?

273
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,642
Why not?
We already know each other's secrets.

274
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,235
Thanks for the breakfast.

275
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,700
Two ships that pass in the night
should always buy each other breakfast.

276
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,827
Can l buy you another drink?

277
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,835
Another one for me and the lady.

278
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,588
You look different...

279
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,924
...more relaxed.

280
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,718
lt's the lights and the Scotch.

281
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,304
How come you didn't catch your bus?

282
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,389
l wasn't waiting for a bus.

283
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,433
Then why go to the station?

284
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,852
For the same reason you went.

285
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,272
At that hour, you haven't got much choice.

286
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,528
Besides, l only live three blocks from there.

287
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,740
Where do you live?

288
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,284
Around.

289
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,453
l know where you live.

290
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,583
ln a locker in a bus station.

291
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,630
What's it like living in a locker?

292
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,049
Cramped.

293
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,054
Do you always drink like this
so early in the morning?

294
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,432
Do you always ask so many questions?

295
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,936
Not always.

296
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,066
Sometimes l wake up and l can't sleep,
not without a drink.

297
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,111
The bars don't open until 8:00.

298
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,742
Mac, over there, has faith in me.
When l'm broke he trusts me.

299
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,079
Don't you trust me, Mac?

300
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,747
Check.

301
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,586
When l'm not broke,
l usually have a bottle in my room...

302
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,297
...in which case l sleep very well indeed.

303
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,926
You talk kind of funny, but l like it.

304
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,596
l used to be an actress.

305
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,222
What do you do now?

306
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:47,852
l'm a college girl, two days a week.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays l go to college.

307
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,356
You don't look like a college girl.

308
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,944
l'm the emancipated type,
real emancipated.

309
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:02,074
l didn't mean that. Whatever that means.
l mean you just don't look young enough.

310
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,284
l'm not.

311
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,286
Then why go to college?

312
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,456
Got nothing else to do
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

313
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,833
What do you do on the other days?

314
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,293
l drink.

315
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,882
No more.

316
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:24,055
l'm getting sleepy.
Thank you very much, Mr....

317
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,807
Eddie, the name is Eddie.

318
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,227
The name should be Eddie.

319
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,396
What should my name be?

320
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,650
l don't know, whatever you like it to be.

321
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,653
l like it to be what it is, Sarah.

322
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:43,240
That's a Biblical name.
Do you want to know its meaning?

323
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,663
l could always get us a bottle.

324
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,836
No.

325
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,507
A fifth of Scotch.

326
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,345
What do you want me to do,
step out in the alley?

327
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,264
No.

328
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,392
l'll take you home.

329
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,025
All right.

330
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:44,385
lt's all right. l'm not drunk, l'm lame.

331
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,456
Why me?

332
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,897
Please! You're too hungry.

333
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,664
Take it. lt's yours.

334
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:48,217
The room is $1 .50 a night,
or $7 by the week.

335
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,012
- By the night.
- ln advance.

336
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,404
A bottle of beer.

337
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:40,913
Hey, mister, is it okay if l grab a cue?

338
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,166
- You're Eddie Felson!
- Who is he?

339
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,795
l saw you play at Ames the other night.

340
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:54,468
l'll play you a game
and keep one hand in my pocket.

341
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,096
Man, you're way out of our league.

342
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:07,273
- What are you stuck for?
- A three. That's enough for me.

343
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,318
Thanks.

344
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,323
Can l buy you fellows a drink?

345
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:22,997
You know, you shoot good,
but you also shoot lucky.

346
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,708
Yeah, l shoot lucky.

347
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:07,935
- Why did you do that?
- l wanted to see what kind of day it is.

348
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,230
A day like any other.

349
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,191
- People come. People go.
- Give me a drag.

350
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,824
- What time is it?
- 1 1 :00.

351
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,828
l'll be back later.

352
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,247
Why?

353
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,627
Come here.

354
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:38,549
You need a shave.
You mustn't go looking like that.

355
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,886
There's a razor and shaving cream in
the bathroom, compliments of the house.

356
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,097
Why did you say that, Sarah?

357
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,393
- How do you know my name was Sarah?
- You told me.

358
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,648
l lie. When l'm drunk l lie.

359
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,068
So what's your name today?

360
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,821
lt's Sarah.

361
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,449
Eddie...

362
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,871
...l've got troubles
and l think maybe you've got troubles.

363
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,750
Maybe we should leave each other alone.

364
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,302
My things are at the hotel.
l'll bring them over later.

365
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,637
l'm not sure.

366
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,056
l don't know.

367
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,811
What do you want to know, and why?

368
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,026
Thank you.

369
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,309
- Where have you been all day?
- At school. lt's Thursday.

370
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,603
Oh, l forgot.

371
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,441
You were asleep when l left.
l didn't want to wake you.

372
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,904
Did you go out?

373
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,782
l went out for a couple of hours.

374
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,175
A present.

375
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:55,394
You know,
l've been living here for almost three years.

376
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,023
Now, in three days,
it seems like l know everybody.

377
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,068
When l pass people on the street...

378
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,530
...l want to stop them and say,
''Listen, l've got a fellow! ''

379
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,746
Thanks.

380
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,423
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?

381
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,262
Museums, art galleries, concerts.

382
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,600
l believe you
when you say you go to school.

383
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:37,811
- Do you want to go with me?
- Are you kidding?

384
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,355
See that book?

385
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:46,153
l began it when l first got here,
l haven't finished the first chapter.

386
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,156
Did you read all those books?

387
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,326
Got it all in your head?

388
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:57,331
When l'm sober. They get a little mixed up
when l'm drunk. Usually they're mixed up.

389
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,084
Stop talking about yourself
like you're a lush. l don't like it.

390
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,714
You should go to a clinic,
and get some treatment.

391
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,300
l'm getting treatment right here.

392
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,929
l'm hungry.

393
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,264
Take your choice.

394
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,810
l got enough so we won't have to leave
the house till Tuesday.

395
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,064
What did all this stuff cost you?

396
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,109
- When you got money, you'll pay.
- l want to know, to keep the score.

397
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,946
The bills are right here.
You didn't say what you wanted.

398
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,035
- Don't you ever cook anything?
- Eggs. How do you like them?

399
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,870
Raw.

400
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,208
l cut my finger.

401
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,462
- l got something in my bag.
- lt's not bad.

402
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,141
Eddie, what's in that case?

403
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:04,856
- Haven't you opened it?
- No. Why should l? lt's yours.

404
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,942
lt's a machine gun.

405
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:13,615
A guy told me, in the big city
l'd need a machine gun. So l bought one.

406
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,582
Where did you get the money
to pay for all this?

407
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,838
l mean liquor and the groceries
and the rent.

408
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,219
From a rich old man
who used to be my lover.

409
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,484
Hello, Eddie.

410
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,407
Hello, Charlie.

411
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,660
Come on in.

412
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,168
- That's my girl.
- Hello, Eddie's girl.

413
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,630
l looked all over for you.

414
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:14,760
- How did you find me?
- l asked around.

415
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,058
- Do you want me to go?
- No. Stick around.

416
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,855
- Can we get you a drink?
- l don't want to be no bother.

417
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,066
Don't play it small.
lt don't look good on you.

418
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,278
- How do you want me to play? l'm broke.
- So am l.

419
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,363
Sit down.

420
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,533
Would you get us a couple of drinks?

421
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:44,664
You walked out on me. No goodbye,
no nothing. Like a thief in the dark.

422
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,169
We were partners, more than partners.

423
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,421
He was like a....

424
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,259
- A son.
- Yes, like a son.

425
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,848
l've known him since he was 16.
The first time l saw him in Oakland, l said:

426
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:07,395
''This is a talented boy.
This is a smart boy.''

427
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,022
Talk to me.

428
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,776
l want you to come back
on the road with me.

429
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,530
l have no stomach
for that kind of life anymore.

430
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:21,827
What is your life like here? Playing the
small rooms, winning a few bucks a day.

431
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,746
l'll connect. l'll get your money back.

432
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:30,001
Do you intend to play Fats again at Ames?
ls that what's on your mind?

433
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:35,257
Never been out of it.
l'm going to beat that fat man...

434
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:40,428
...with that curly hair and
those diamond rings and that carnation.

435
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,475
This boy is crazy! They wiped the floor
with him and he wants to go back.

436
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:50,063
- What for? Another beating?
- You'll get your money back!

437
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:54,818
He thinks l care about the money.
l care about you.

438
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,155
Do you care about me, Eddie?

439
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,284
We were together a long time,
night and day.

440
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,078
So how do you say goodbye?

441
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,833
You give me the car and $100.

442
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,963
Do you think l care about the dough
or the car? l care about you.

443
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,427
This boy is the greatest pool hustler
you ever saw.

444
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:24,890
A high-class con man.
He can charm anybody into anything.

445
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:29,436
Did he tell you how well we did
on the road? We had everything.

446
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,063
We ate well, we slept late...

447
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:35,692
...we had money to burn.
Whiskey, dames.... Excuse me.

448
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,321
l tell you what, take her along.

449
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,742
And if you don't want to start right away,
we won't start right away.

450
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,412
We'll drive to Miami.
Get it all out of your system.

451
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:51,041
Have a few laughs, a few weeks in the sun.

452
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:58,089
- With what?
- Don't worry, l'll raise the money.

453
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,761
- Yeah? Where?
- What's the difference? l'll raise it.

454
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,225
Could l have another drink?

455
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,536
Did you hold out on me, Charlie?

456
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,082
How much?

457
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,376
How much?

458
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:42,133
My 25%. Approximately $1,500.

459
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:49,015
You crumb! With that much
l could have beat him! That's all l needed.

460
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,434
Give me the money!

461
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:55,021
- What for, to play Fats again?
- Yes, l'll play Fats again!

462
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,483
lf you want to come back on the road,
the money is yours...

463
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,736
...but not if you want to give it to Fats.

464
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,863
What do you say?

465
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:09,953
You still don't see, do you, Charlie?
You're nothing but a small-time Charlie.

466
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,249
You would love to keep me hustling,
wouldn't you?

467
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,836
ln a couple more years,
with me playing in those little towns...

468
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,714
...you might be able to buy a poolroom
in Oakland...

469
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,800
...six tables and a handbook on the side.

470
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,512
ls that when you say goodbye to me?

471
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,141
- ls that what you think?
- Yeah. That's what l think.

472
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,062
All right, that's what l want...

473
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,025
...a poolroom and a little handbook
on the side.

474
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,569
l'm getting old.

475
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,034
Lay down and die by yourself.
Don't take me with you.

476
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,419
- Just like that.
- Yes, just like that!

477
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,772
Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.

478
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,455
Give me another drink.

479
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,917
Boy.

480
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,629
Everybody wants a piece of me!

481
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,555
Won't you have one?

482
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,439
What did he have to come back here for,
anyway?

483
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,613
Come here.

484
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,448
Come here.

485
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:56,161
- Are you going out?
- For a little while.

486
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,212
Are you okay?

487
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,741
What are you writing?

488
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,704
lt's a story. A story l'm making up.

489
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,422
Give it to me.

490
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,177
What is this supposed to mean?

491
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,679
Give it back to me!

492
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,024
What does this mean?

493
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:12,820
''We have a contract of depravity.
All we have to do is draw the blinds.''

494
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,249
Write yourself another story!

495
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,752
Well, what else have we got?

496
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,297
We never talk about anything.

497
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:37,303
We stay here in this room
and we drink and we make love.

498
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,974
We're strangers!

499
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,395
What happens when the liquor
and money run out, Eddie?

500
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,982
You told Charlie to lay down and die.

501
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,943
Will you say that to me, too?

502
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,573
What happens, Eddie?

503
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:03,997
- You find another rich old lover.
- That's right. And l'm sure you'll help me!

504
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,088
Are you waiting for me to cry?

505
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,633
You bum!

506
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,303
You poolroom bum!

507
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,027
- Give me a bottle of beer.
- Right.

508
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,575
- How did you make out?
- l made a few bucks.

509
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,786
- Poker game?
- Yeah.

510
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,371
ls it open?

511
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,877
lt's open.

512
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,880
- What will you have?
- Give me a beer.

513
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,057
- Okay?
- Sit down.

514
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,188
- What's the limit?
- Half and a dollar.

515
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,150
- Give me $10 worth of chips.
- $10.

516
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,906
- Make it $20.
- $20.

517
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,868
Cut.

518
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,245
Deal.

519
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,760
- Bourbon. J.T.S. Brown.
- Two.

520
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,013
l'm buying.

521
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,683
l thought you only drank milk.

522
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,478
- Only when l work.
- Yeah? Why?

523
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,981
l like it. lt's good for you.

524
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:59,362
lf you're gambling, whiskey gives you
an excuse for losing. You don't need that.

525
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:04,575
- How did you make out in the poker game?
- l lost $20.

526
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,369
Poker's not your game.

527
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,913
- What is?
- Pool.

528
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,709
Are you being cute?

529
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:20,007
No pool player shoots better pool
than you shot the other night at Ames.

530
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:24,262
- You have talent.
- So l have talent. So what beat me?

531
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,641
- Character.
- Yeah, sure.

532
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:33,020
You're damn right, l'm sure.
Everybody has talent. l have talent.

533
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:38,401
You think you can play big-money pool
or poker for 40 hours with only talent?

534
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:43,030
ls Fats the best in the country
just because he has talent? No.

535
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,452
He has more character in one finger
than you have in your body.

536
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,621
- l got drunk.
- He drank as much whiskey as you did.

537
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,541
- He knows how to drink.
- You bet he knows how.

538
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,918
You think that's a talent, too?

539
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,129
You think Fats was born
knowing how to drink?

540
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:02,675
Okay, what do l do now?
Lie down and bow from the ankles?

541
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,220
- What do l do, go home?
- That's your problem.

542
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,889
Or do l stay?

543
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,393
Stay until l hustle up
enough to play Fats again.

544
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:16,522
Maybe, by that time,
l'll have developed some character.

545
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,611
Maybe, by that time, you'll die of old age.

546
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:27,617
- How much will you need?
- $1,000.

547
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,661
At least $3,000.

548
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,665
He'll start at $500 a game,
and he'll beat the pants off you.

549
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,960
That's the way he plays against a man
who knows the way the game is.

550
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:42,757
He'll beat you five times or more,
depending on your nerves.

551
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:48,721
He might be scared of you. That could
change things, but don't count on it.

552
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,684
How do you know
when nobody knows that much?

553
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,980
Did you see that big car parked outside?

554
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,359
Well, that's mine. l like that car.

555
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:06,697
l get a new one every year, because l know
what guys like you and him will do.

556
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,701
l made enough off you the other night
to pay for it twice over.

557
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,204
ln that case, you owe me another drink.

558
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,624
Eddie?

559
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,337
- May l get personal?
- What have you been so far?

560
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,340
Eddie, you're a born loser.

561
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,303
What's that supposed to mean?

562
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,558
lt was the first time
l'd ever seen Fats hooked, really hooked.

563
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:37,270
- But you let him off.
- l got drunk.

564
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,439
Sure you did.
You have the best excuse for losing.

565
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,733
No trouble losing
when you have a good excuse.

566
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:46,946
But winning, that can be heavy
on your back, too, like a monkey.

567
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:52,076
You can drop that load with an excuse.
You have to learn to feel sorry for yourself.

568
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,706
lt's one of the best indoor sports, feeling
sorry for yourself, and enjoyed by all.

569
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,792
- Especially the born losers.
- Thanks for the drink.

570
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,422
- Wait. Maybe l can help you.
- To do what?

571
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,175
- Get the $3,000, play Fats again.
- Why?

572
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:13,931
Ten reasons, maybe fifteen.
Also there's something in it for me.

573
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,892
- l figured that. How much?
- 75%.

574
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,978
- For who?
- For me.

575
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:25,818
That's a big slice.
Who do you think you are, General Motors?

576
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,572
How much do you think
you are worth these days?

577
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,909
l'm supplying the money and time,
for that l get 75% return, if you win.

578
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,203
- You think l can lose?
- That's all l've seen.

579
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:40,291
- You saw me win $18,000.
- You want to hustle pool, don't you?

580
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,171
The game isn't like football.
Nobody pays you for yardage.

581
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,340
When you hustle,
you keep score real simple.

582
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,093
At the end of the game, you count
your money to find out who is best.

583
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:56,098
Why back me, then?
Back yourself, play poker and get rich.

584
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:01,228
l am already rich, but l like action.
That's one thing you're good for, action.

585
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:06,692
Besides, like l say, you've got talent.

586
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,780
You already told me that.

587
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:16,035
You cut that slice down to bite-size,
and maybe we can talk.

588
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,122
We don't talk. l don't make bad bets.
lt is 75%-25%.

589
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,501
- Kiss off.
- Wait.

590
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:33,052
- What'll you do about the money?
- There are places. l'll scuffle around.

591
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:37,723
The word's out on you, Eddie.
ln the wrong place, they'll eat you alive.

592
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,103
When did you adopt me?

593
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,773
l don't know when it was.

594
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,653
- Hi.
- Hi.

595
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,289
You lucky punk. l quit you!

596
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,252
Do you want in, friend?

597
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:53,257
- How much are you playing for?
- $1 on the five. $2 on the nine.

598
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,471
- l'll play a couple of games, just for kicks.
- Okay, friend.

599
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,307
That's it for me.

600
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,644
That does it for me, too.

601
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,648
- Are you quitting, too?
- You're a pretty good player.

602
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,818
- How much are you ahead?
- A couple of bucks.

603
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:17,323
- lt's just you and me.
- l guess it is, boy. Just you and me.

604
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:21,827
Do you want to raise the bet?
$2 on the five. $5 on the nine.

605
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:27,208
You know, kid,
l think maybe you're a hustler.

606
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,126
- Try me.
- Shoot.

607
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,003
Okay.

608
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,527
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?

609
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,698
Let's cut out the small stuff.
$100 freeze-out.

610
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,743
Ten games at $10 a game,
the winner takes all.

611
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,537
Then we'll see who quits.

612
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,206
Okay, friend, you're on.

613
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,543
- Call it.
- Heads.

614
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,380
You win.

615
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,394
You better not miss, friend.

616
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:34,066
l don't rattle, kid.
But just for that, l'm going to beat you flat!

617
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:42,908
That's one.

618
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,749
That's five.

619
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,837
That's six.

620
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,261
That's ten.

621
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,431
You two-bit punk, come on. Pay up, $100!

622
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,148
- You quitting, friend?
- Yes, l'm quitting.

623
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:36,378
Why, you're a pool shark, boy.
A real pool shark.

624
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:41,800
- So is he.
- You're better than he was. Much better.

625
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,804
There's your money, boy.

626
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,482
There's your money, boy.

627
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,698
Pool shark!

628
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,033
Wait a minute.

629
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,329
Let's give this boy his money.

630
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:15,250
We always pay what we lose, boy.

631
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,840
We've got no use for pool sharks
around here!

632
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,878
- Who is it?
- lt's me, Eddie.

633
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,743
What happened?

634
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,247
l got beat up.

635
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,755
They broke my thumbs.

636
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,425
God!

637
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,596
Sarah, they broke my thumbs.

638
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,851
Broke my thumbs.

639
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,825
lt's all right.

640
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,953
l'm here.

641
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,525
You can read it if you want to.

642
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,738
Do you want to go out for a while?
To a movie?

643
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,407
No.

644
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,787
- Do you want a drink?
- No, do you?

645
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,299
What's it so hot in here for?

646
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,434
Please!

647
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,498
- Sarah, do you think l'm a loser?
- A loser?

648
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:06,708
Yeah.

649
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:11,964
l met this guy, Bert Gordon.
He said l was a born loser.

650
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,175
- Would he know?
- He knows a lot.

651
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,305
- Why did he tell you?
- l'm not sure.

652
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:24,518
He says there are people
who always look for an excuse to lose.

653
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,231
- What does this Bert Gordon do?
- He's a gambler.

654
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,652
- ls he a winner?
- He owns things.

655
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,990
- ls that what makes a winner?
- What else does?

656
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,745
- Does it bother you, what he said?
- Yeah.

657
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,584
lt bothers me a lot.

658
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,547
Because, you see, twice,
once at Ames with Fats...

659
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,842
...and then again at Arthur's....

660
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:01,305
That cheap, crummy poolroom.
Why did l do it, Sarah?

661
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:05,183
l could have beat that guy cold.
He never would've known.

662
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,061
l just had to show him.

663
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:13,650
l had to show those punks
how great the game can be when it's great.

664
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:18,071
You know, anything can be great, anything.

665
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,742
Bricklaying can be great if a guy knows.

666
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:26,204
lf he knows what he's doing and why,
and if he can make it come off.

667
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:31,251
Why, when l'm really going, l feel like a....

668
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:38,967
Like a jockey must feel sitting on his horse,
with all that speed and power underneath.

669
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,846
He's coming into the stretch,
the pressure's on and he knows.

670
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:47,559
He just feels when to let it go,
and how much.

671
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:52,147
He's got everything working for him.
Timing, touch.

672
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,068
lt's a great feeling.

673
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,322
A real great feeling,
when you're right and you know it.

674
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:05,619
Suddenly, there's oil in my arm.
The pool cue is part of me.

675
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:10,082
The pool cue has nerves in it.
lt's a piece of wood with nerves.

676
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,379
Feel the roll of those balls.
You don't have to look, you just know.

677
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,634
You make shots
that nobody's ever made before.

678
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:26,973
And you play that game
the way nobody's ever played it before.

679
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,353
You're not a loser, you're a winner.

680
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:36,274
Some men never feel that way
about anything.

681
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,611
l love you, Eddie.

682
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,748
Some day, Sarah, you'll settle down.

683
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:59,131
You'll marry a college professor.
You'll write a great book, maybe about me.

684
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,717
''Fast Eddie Felson, Hustler.''

685
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,101
l love you.

686
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,605
Do you need the words?

687
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,775
Yes, l need them very much.

688
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:23,655
lf you ever say them,
l'll never let you take them back.

689
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,346
You glad?

690
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,559
Yes, l'm glad.

691
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,709
Hello, Eddie.

692
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:19,711
Hi.

693
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,506
- How's business?
- Slow.

694
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:27,761
- Something wrong with your hand?
- l had an accident. A place called Arthur's.

695
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,972
You seem to do all right that way.

696
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:34,059
My game is about 20% off, maybe more.

697
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,897
- Did somebody step on your hand?
- A big creep broke my thumbs.

698
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,233
A man named Turk?

699
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,528
You know everybody, don't you?

700
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:48,114
Everybody who can hurt me or help me.
lt pays.

701
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,951
- You should give me lessons.
- Sign up.

702
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,245
Where do l sign?

703
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:57,249
The first match l have in mind
is in Louisville, Kentucky.

704
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,085
Name the place, boss, l'll be there.

705
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,921
- What happened?
- Like l told you, my thumbs.

706
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,173
l don't mean the thumbs.
You already told me.

707
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,926
- l've been thinking.
- Thinking about what?

708
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:13,974
Maybe l'm not such a great piece
of property right now.

709
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:19,729
A 25% slice of something big
is better than a 100% slice of nothing.

710
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,608
Give us a couple of drinks.

711
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,444
J.T.S. Brown.

712
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,621
- Good evening, sir.
- 'Evening.

713
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:42,210
- Give us a nice quiet table.
- Yes, sir, right this way.

714
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:10,238
Would you like a drink before dinner?

715
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,573
Okay?

716
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,827
Sherry, very old, very dry.

717
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,496
Two.

718
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,374
Sherry?

719
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:30,675
- lt's a nice joint. You look very pretty.
- l feel pretty.

720
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:37,265
- What's so funny?
- Your tie.

721
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,809
l've never seen you wear one before.

722
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,229
There's a first time for everything.

723
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,033
Yeah, that's great.

724
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:01,373
Excuse me.

725
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,893
To you, Eddie.

726
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,120
Thank you, sir.

727
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,543
What is it, Eddie?

728
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,213
Want another drink?

729
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,925
What do you want to tell me?

730
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,595
l'll be leaving town for a little while.

731
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,601
For how long?

732
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:07,605
- l don't know.
- A week, a year?

733
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:12,736
- More like a week. l'll be back.
- Sure.

734
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,822
Let's go home.

735
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,263
Taxi!

736
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,641
- No, l'll walk.
- Come here.

737
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,994
Better get some dry things on.

738
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:20,553
- Don't you want to know where l'm going?
- No.

739
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:28,353
Yes, l want to know what for,
but l don't want to ask.

740
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,905
l'm going to Kentucky,
to Louisville with a friend.

741
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,575
l'm going to try to make some money.
l need it.

742
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,120
l'll leave early in the morning.

743
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,124
- Leave now.
- Grow up.

744
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,294
Why should l?

745
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,965
l'm going there to play pool
with a guy named Findley.

746
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,759
l need the action and l need the money.

747
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,678
l told you l'd be back.

748
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:06,641
lf you were returning, you wouldn't
have taken me out or bought this dress.

749
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:10,395
You're hustling me.
You've never stopped hustling me.

750
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:15,066
No, l've never hustled you,
even when l thought l was, you know it.

751
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,611
Do you want me to sit and wait?

752
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:22,699
Faithful little Sarah.
Pull the shades down and sit.

753
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,910
When you feel like coming back,
you'll come back and love me.

754
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:29,372
And then you'll go away again.
ls that your idea of love?

755
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,293
l've got no idea of love.

756
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:39,173
Neither one of us would know what it was
if we saw it coming down the street.

757
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,218
l'd know it.

758
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,389
l'd know it.

759
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,186
For God's sake, what are you doing to me?

760
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,688
l love you.

761
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,317
What's your idea of love, chains?

762
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:02,405
No.

763
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,457
l made you up, didn't l, Eddie?

764
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,253
You weren't real.

765
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,256
l made you up like everything else.

766
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,010
There was no car crash, Eddie.

767
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,306
When l was five l had polio.

768
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:33,394
l was never an actress.
The rich old man is my father.

769
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,564
He walked out on us when l was seven.

770
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:41,194
He sends a check every month
to buy his way out of my life.

771
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,239
The men l've known...

772
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:49,702
...after they'd left, l'd say,
''They weren't real, l made them up.''

773
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,832
But you, Eddie, l wanted you to be real.

774
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,172
l'm so scared!

775
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,175
l'm scared.

776
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:23,236
- Sarah Packard, Bert Gordon.
- How do you do?

777
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,535
That one of mine goes in Drawing Room A.

778
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,412
Thank you.

779
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,163
l got it.

780
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:42,755
- You sure you'll be comfortable, Miss....
- Packard. Sarah Packard.

781
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:45,258
lt takes me a while to memorize a name.

782
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:48,177
- Are you sure you don't want anything?
- No, l'm fine.

783
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,266
You ever been to Louisville for Derby week,
Miss Packard?

784
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:58,229
- l've never been to Louisville.
- Lots of action, lots of money, lots of class.

785
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,191
You see the best dressed,
most beautiful women in the world.

786
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,443
Knock your eyes out.

787
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:13,619
Findley is rich. His grandfather
left him 20% of a tobacco company.

788
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,414
What, and he hustles, too?

789
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,544
He's a gentleman, a gentleman gambler
who gets his kicks playing with hustlers.

790
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:24,505
He's got an old southern mansion,
with a pool table.

791
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:27,300
He drinks eight-year-old bourbon,
smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.

792
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,510
- How good is he?
- l don't know.

793
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:32,472
- l never saw him play. l hear he's great.
- l'm ready.

794
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,474
As soon as l've finished my coffee.

795
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:37,518
- You have great confidence in me.
- l don't.

796
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,272
- l've confidence in Findley.
- What's that supposed to mean?

797
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:44,567
lt means l'm confident he's a loser.
All the way a loser.

798
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:48,404
You are only about one half loser,
the other half winner.

799
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,531
- l'm finished.
- l got it.

800
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:54,118
No. When you play for me,
l pick up all the tabs.

801
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:01,501
Fats knew the game was in the clutch,
so he had to do something to stop you.

802
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:05,880
- He played it smart.
- l've played that game in my head, too.

803
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,049
Play it again. Learn something.

804
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,845
Fats went to the john.

805
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:16,349
He washed his face, cleaned his fingernails,
made his mind a blank...

806
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:19,602
...combed his hair,
and came back all ready to go.

807
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:21,687
You were through.

808
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:27,068
You saw how he looked,
clean, ready to start all over again.

809
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,861
Hold tight and push hard.

810
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,657
Do you know what you were doing?
You were waiting to get beat.

811
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:39,372
You were flattened out on your butt,
swimming in glory and whiskey...

812
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:42,625
...probably deciding how you could lose.

813
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:47,463
What makes you know so much?
How do you know what he was thinking?

814
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:49,715
l know.

815
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,385
Been there myself.

816
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,014
We've all been there, haven't we,
Miss Packard?

817
01:38:58,307 --> 01:38:59,976
Got a match?

818
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:07,191
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?

819
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,402
l forgot all about it.

820
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:13,030
- How is your hand?
- Fine.

821
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:16,117
Good. l'd hate to put my money
on a cripple.

822
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:21,539
- Why did you say a thing like that?
- l'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense.

823
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,625
lt was a figure of speech.

824
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:28,463
- That's right, Miss Packard.
- A fact is a fact.

825
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:32,884
She's a smart girl, Eddie.

826
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:57,950
Right this way, Mr. Gordon.
Here you are, Mr. Gordon, Suite 56.

827
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,828
l wired ahead for two suites adjoining.

828
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,080
- l don't recall.
- l do! l want two suites.

829
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,625
l'm sorry, we're filled up,
this is Derby week.

830
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,793
You're wrong, you must've gotten my wire.

831
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:11,088
- Look through your reservations.
- l'll see what l can do.

832
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:16,052
Yes, you're right, Mr. Gordon.
l mislaid your wire. Two adjoining suites?

833
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:34,028
That's sweet music in there. You can
almost smell the action and the money.

834
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:37,198
l can feel it right down
in the bottom of my shoes.

835
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,076
- Eddie!
- Billy, how are you?

836
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:44,580
l didn't know you were here. Everyone's
here. lt's like a hustlers' convention!

837
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:49,335
West Stone Kid, Johnny Jumbo.
Come in, the guys will be glad to see you.

838
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,297
- What room are we in?
- 57.

839
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,007
l'll be up later.

840
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,841
Wait, Miss Packard.

841
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,177
We're neighbors, now. Call me Sarah.

842
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,055
l want to talk to you.

843
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,308
Do we need words?

844
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:49,437
l think so. We could cut each other up,
but that'd be bad for everybody...

845
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,898
...for me, for you,
and worst of all for Eddie.

846
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,818
You know what's good for him.

847
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:57,612
To win.

848
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,822
For whom and for what?

849
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,744
What makes the world go around?
For money and for glory.

850
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:08,205
Answer my first question. For whom?

851
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,958
Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

852
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,377
There is no tomorrow with you.

853
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:17,423
You own all the tomorrows,
because you buy them today, cheap.

854
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,719
Nobody has to sell.

855
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,348
- You bastard--
- Miss Ladybird!

856
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:30,436
You are here on a rain check, and l know it.
Hanging on by your nails.

857
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,438
You let that glory whistle blow for Eddie...

858
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:35,566
...and you're a wreck on the track,
a horse that finished last.

859
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,779
Don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird.
Live and let live!

860
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,615
While you can.

861
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:49,288
l'll make it up to you.

862
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:52,917
How?

863
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:56,587
You tell me.

864
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,156
Thanks.

865
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,619
There are three late scratches
in the following race:

866
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:32,331
Rosemary, Stroke of Luck, and L & R.

867
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:36,710
- Where's Bert?
- He went off somewhere.

868
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:38,796
That old loving horse paid $22.40!

869
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:43,676
With the $200 l won from that jockey
last night, and today at the track, l've $540.

870
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,846
- Here, you hold it.
- Why?

871
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,264
Just for luck.

872
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,769
- Findley's here.
- Where?

873
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,439
Over there by the bar.

874
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:08,033
- Aren't you going to talk to him?
- Sit tight. He'll be over here.

875
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,457
- You ready for another?
- Thank you.

876
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:16,167
No more for me.

877
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:20,880
Hello. l haven't seen you in a long time.

878
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:24,091
l haven't been here for a long time.

879
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:29,013
Miss Packard, Eddie Felson. James....

880
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,431
Findley.

881
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,850
- Glad to meet you.
- And l, you.

882
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:37,688
l think l've heard about you, Mr. Felson.
You play pocket billiards, don't you?

883
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:43,486
- Now and then. Why? Do you?
- A little, but l'm afraid l generally lose.

884
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,446
So does Eddie.

885
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:52,453
- l win sometimes.
- l bet you do, Mr. Felson. l just bet you do.

886
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,663
How much?

887
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,209
Bert?

888
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,337
l believe Mr. Felson
is making a proposition.

889
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,630
Could be.

890
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:04,632
Well, Mr. Felson...

891
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:08,385
...maybe you'd like to come to my place
sometime. We can play billiards.

892
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,678
When?

893
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:13,557
- You're very direct.
- That's right. When?

894
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,894
- Tonight?
- What time?

895
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,814
l'm having some people for drinks
right after the races.

896
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,985
Why don't you all come?
Then about 10:00 we can play.

897
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:26,987
- We'll be there.
- Good.

898
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,247
lf you don't mind,
l think l will stay at the hotel.

899
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,457
- What's the matter?
- l'm tired.

900
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:41,752
Come on, it'll be a lot of laughs.
Findley's parties are famous.

901
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:46,799
He invites everybody from high society
to every tramp in town.

902
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,884
Another way he gets his kicks.

903
01:45:48,968 --> 01:45:53,556
lt excites him to be around
the criminal type. Some men are like that.

904
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,058
Some women, too.

905
01:48:15,572 --> 01:48:18,659
- What's the matter?
- lt's all right. She drank too much.

906
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:21,495
Let her sleep it off.

907
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:23,038
Cut it out!

908
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:25,290
Do what he says, come on, upstairs.

909
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:38,280
Do you gentlemen care for a drink?

910
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:41,700
- None for me. Let's play.
- By all means.

911
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:49,458
Thought we came here to play pool?

912
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:53,128
l don't play pool, l play billiards.

913
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,384
lt's my house, my game.
You don't have to play if you don't want to.

914
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,471
- We won't.
- Bert, let me play him.

915
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:08,143
- How much?
- We'll start small. $100 a game?

916
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:11,563
- Did you ever play billiards before?
- Sure.

917
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:13,690
You hustling me?

918
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:19,196
l'm sure he knows what he's doing.
You can afford $100 to find out.

919
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,282
Deal the cards.

920
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:52,271
Beautiful shot!
You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson.

921
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:56,441
- Sure you wouldn't care for a drink?
- Nothing for me.

922
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,738
How do we stand?

923
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:03,866
- About even.
- When do l raise the bet?

924
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:06,743
- l don't know.
- lf that's his best game, l can beat him.

925
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,996
Level with me. Did you ever play billiards?

926
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,455
What's the difference?

927
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:14,585
There's a cue, balls on the table.
All you got to do is get the feel of it.

928
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:17,963
- Shall we raise the stakes?
- How much?

929
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:19,882
$500?

930
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:21,383
You think you can beat him?

931
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:24,511
Of course he does.
He wouldn't play me if he didn't.

932
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:28,307
l didn't ask him, can he beat you,
l already know he can.

933
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:31,977
l asked him, will he?
That's two different things.

934
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,395
l can beat him.

935
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:35,814
All right, $500.

936
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:42,362
Have you noticed, Bert, this fellow here
bears a striking resemblance to you?

937
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,908
lt seems you might have modeled
for the artist.

938
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,995
lt's possible.

939
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,131
Mark that one up, too, Bert.

940
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,884
l'll beat him the next game.

941
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:08,722
How are the hands?

942
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,308
Fine.

943
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,894
Rack up your cue, we're leaving.

944
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:18,106
- That's a shame. The night is young.
- The night is $2,000 old.

945
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,651
- Hey, Bert, wait.
- l said we're leaving.

946
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:35,874
l can beat him, Bert.

947
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:40,629
He suckered me, l didn't think he knew
how to hustle. l can outplay and beat him!

948
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:44,341
l don't believe you, Eddie.
l think you're still a loser.

949
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:49,596
l'll play him on my own money!

950
01:52:51,723 --> 01:52:53,100
Be right back.

951
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:25,465
Okay, come on, let's play.

952
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,264
l'm broke.

953
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:36,059
- That's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
- For whom, Mr. Findley?

954
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,645
Bert, he only beat me by a point.

955
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:42,107
- The bank is closed.
- Don't get off me, please!

956
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:45,277
l know when to quit. You don't.
Win or lose, you don't know!

957
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,279
What do you want me to do? Say it...

958
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:49,156
...and you've got it,
but don't get off me now.

959
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:50,782
Don't beg him.

960
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:56,330
- Go back to the hotel.
- Please, Eddie, don't beg him.

961
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,624
Go back to the hotel. Take a cab, go back!

962
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:06,298
Doesn't all this come through to you?
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

963
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,384
That man, this place, the people.

964
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:14,598
They wear masks, and under them
they're perverted, twisted, crippled!

965
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,893
- Shut up.
- Don't wear a mask. You don't have to.

966
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,104
That's Turk, who broke your thumbs!

967
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:24,941
He won't break your thumbs,
he'll break your heart, your guts...

968
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:29,446
...and for the same reason,
because he hates you for what you are.

969
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,658
- For what you have and he hasn't.
- Get off my back, once and for all!

970
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,869
Would you get off my back?

971
01:54:42,584 --> 01:54:44,002
Play him, Eddie.

972
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:47,672
Play him for $1,000 a game.

973
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:25,085
Will you take a check?

974
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,341
Cash.

975
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,430
How much do l owe you?

976
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,557
$12,000.

977
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,291
Here.

978
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,379
lt's been an interesting evening.

979
01:56:13,758 --> 01:56:15,051
lt sure has.

980
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:18,597
Charles, call a cab for these gentlemen,
please.

981
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:23,435
- l'd show you to the door, but--
- Yes, you're tired.

982
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:26,563
And beat.

983
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:29,941
Yeah.

984
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:35,280
You must come again.

985
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:38,992
Yeah, sure.

986
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:53,256
Here's your share: $3,000.

987
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:57,385
- The cab is waiting.
- Thanks.

988
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:02,098
- Eddie, let's go.
- l want to walk.

989
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,393
lt's a long walk.

990
01:57:05,477 --> 01:57:07,103
l got time, Bert.

991
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:10,232
You want me to tell her for you?

992
01:57:10,607 --> 01:57:12,108
Tell her what?

993
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:14,945
You got to be hard, Eddie.

994
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:37,861
When are you leaving?

995
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:41,239
ln a little while.
lt's what you want, isn't it?

996
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,284
lt's what Eddie wants.

997
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:49,539
He told me to give you some money.

998
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:55,712
Put it on the bed.
That's the way it's done, isn't it?

999
01:58:58,089 --> 01:59:00,216
That's the way it's done.

1000
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:02,927
The way you're looking at me...

1001
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:06,348
...is that how you look
at a man you've just beaten?

1002
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:12,312
As if you've just taken his money
and now you want his pride?

1003
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:16,566
- All l want is the money.
- Sure.

1004
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:22,447
Sure, the money and the aristocratic
pleasure of seeing him fall apart.

1005
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:27,160
You're a Roman, Bert.
You have to win them all.

1006
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:13,373
You got a drink?

1007
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,799
Give me my key, please. Room 57.

1008
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:10,096
Come on, give me my key.

1009
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:38,833
Now, let's go over this again.
You say you were in the other room....

1010
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:42,420
She closed the door, l told you,
she closed the door.

1011
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:46,174
She closed the door, went in there,
maybe ten, five minutes or so.

1012
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:51,846
Hey, let him come in.

1013
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:58,686
Eddie....

1014
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:28,299
Eddie?

1015
02:02:32,053 --> 02:02:33,263
Eddie?

1016
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:42,105
She came in here, Eddie.

1017
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,774
She asked me for a drink.

1018
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:46,859
l gave her one.

1019
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,113
We had a few more.

1020
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,784
Eddie, she came in here!

1021
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,375
l came to play pool, Fats.

1022
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:34,676
- That's good. For how much?
- You name it.

1023
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:38,304
$1,000 a game?

1024
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:41,057
Let's make it $3,000 a game, Fats.

1025
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:46,104
$3,000, that's my bankroll, my life savings.

1026
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:50,733
What's the matter, Fats?

1027
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:54,362
Beat me the first game,
and l'm on my way back to Oakland.

1028
02:04:58,408 --> 02:04:59,701
Let's go.

1029
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:10,378
Get on me, Bert, l can't lose!

1030
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:15,049
Willie?

1031
02:05:24,308 --> 02:05:26,102
- Call it.
- Heads.

1032
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:17,195
How should l play that one, Bert?

1033
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:19,155
Play it safe?

1034
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:24,076
That's what you always told me,
play it safe, play the percentage.

1035
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,370
Well, here we go, fast and loose.

1036
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,539
One ball, corner pocket.

1037
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:33,169
Percentage players die broke, too,
don't they, Bert?

1038
02:06:42,637 --> 02:06:44,222
How can l lose?

1039
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:47,225
Twelve ball.

1040
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:55,191
l mean, how can l lose?
Because you were right, Bert.

1041
02:06:57,568 --> 02:07:02,323
lt's not enough to have talent,
you've got to have character, too.

1042
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:03,866
Four ball.

1043
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,710
And l sure got character now.

1044
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:18,548
l picked it up in a hotel room in Louisville.

1045
02:07:21,676 --> 02:07:23,511
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

1046
02:07:25,012 --> 02:07:27,890
l'm shooting pool, Fats.
When l miss, you can shoot.

1047
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:35,022
Five ball.

1048
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:41,612
Fourteen ball.

1049
02:07:47,159 --> 02:07:48,578
Four ball.

1050
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:54,834
That's game.

1051
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:08,264
Game!

1052
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:22,862
Eight ball.

1053
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:40,922
Thirteen ball.

1054
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,649
l quit, Eddie.

1055
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,652
l can't beat you.

1056
02:09:04,612 --> 02:09:06,822
Willie, give him the stake.

1057
02:09:10,451 --> 02:09:12,411
You got yourself a pool player.

1058
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,664
Preacher, give me my coat.

1059
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,836
Where do you think you're going?

1060
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:24,840
Eddie?

1061
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:29,345
You owe me money!

1062
02:09:33,933 --> 02:09:36,477
Just how do you figure that, Bert?

1063
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:42,692
- What do you figure l owe you?
- Half!

1064
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:46,487
- ln Louisville, it was 75%.
- Here, it's half.

1065
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,956
What if l don't pay you?

1066
02:10:01,043 --> 02:10:02,545
You don't pay me?

1067
02:10:04,547 --> 02:10:06,841
You'll get your thumbs broken again.

1068
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:11,554
And your fingers.

1069
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:17,977
lf l want them to, they'll break
your right arm in three or four places.

1070
02:10:19,562 --> 02:10:21,022
You better pay him, Eddie.

1071
02:10:36,328 --> 02:10:38,581
You figure you're still my manager?

1072
02:10:38,873 --> 02:10:40,583
l'm a businessman, kid.

1073
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:43,252
You've got a lot of games lined up for me?

1074
02:10:43,377 --> 02:10:45,755
We'll make lots of money together,
from now on.

1075
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,381
50%?

1076
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:51,093
lt don't have to be 50%.
lt can be 30%, 25%.

1077
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:02,104
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we?

1078
02:11:03,564 --> 02:11:05,566
We really gave it to her good.

1079
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:09,111
lf it didn't happen in Louisville,
it would happen someplace else.

1080
02:11:09,195 --> 02:11:13,032
lf not now, six months from now.
That's the kind of dame she was.

1081
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:15,284
Then we twisted it, didn't we, Bert?

1082
02:11:16,869 --> 02:11:21,582
lt doesn't stick in your throat because
you spit it out like everything else!

1083
02:11:25,044 --> 02:11:26,754
But it sticks in mine.

1084
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:30,758
l loved her.

1085
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:35,805
l traded her in on a pool game.

1086
02:11:37,807 --> 02:11:42,561
That wouldn't mean anything to you.
Who did you ever care about?

1087
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:46,398
''Just win,'' you said.
That's the important thing.

1088
02:11:46,774 --> 02:11:49,652
You don't know what winning is.
You're a loser!

1089
02:11:50,277 --> 02:11:53,322
Because you're dead inside,
and you can't live...

1090
02:11:53,406 --> 02:11:56,325
...unless you make everything else
dead around you.

1091
02:11:57,493 --> 02:11:58,911
Too high, Bert.

1092
02:12:00,162 --> 02:12:02,164
Your price is too high.

1093
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:07,837
lf l take it, she never lived. She never died.

1094
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:15,511
We both know that's not true, don't we?
She lived. She died.

1095
02:12:21,142 --> 02:12:22,643
You better....

1096
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:28,023
You tell your boys they better kill me.
They better go all the way with me...

1097
02:12:28,649 --> 02:12:32,862
...because if they just bust me up,
l'll put the pieces together...

1098
02:12:34,238 --> 02:12:36,157
...so help me God, Bert...

1099
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:39,493
...l'll come back and l'll kill you.

1100
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,079
Wait a minute.

1101
02:12:49,837 --> 02:12:51,046
All right.

1102
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:10,065
Only...

1103
02:13:14,695 --> 02:13:17,781
...don't ever walk
into a big-time pool hall again.

1104
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:29,877
Fat Man...

1105
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:33,047
...you shoot a great game of pool.

1106
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:35,299
So do you, Fast Eddie.
