<i>Well, folks, that wraps up the trials
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

309

Hey, pal, sixth place
ain't nothing to be ashamed of.

310
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,702
That was a heck of a run.

311
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,371
Thanks.

Ow! Dagnabbit! Let me drive!

313

and all set, Mayday.

314

Will you stop! Unbelievable!

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,241
Why don't you just go back!

316
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,326
I mean, I think you actually
missed a pothole!

317
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,787
Man, you got to be the worst,

318
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,498
I mean the worst delivery truck
that has ever delivered a delivery!

319
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,124
- Can I help you?
-(COUGHING)

320
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,919
Please tell me
this is Propwash Junction.

321
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,045
Sure is.

322
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,090
Oh, finally. You know,
you're not even on the map.

323
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,175
Yeah, pretty drive though, ain't it?

324

Oh, yeah. Especially if you
like looking at dirt and corn.

325
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,681
Anyway,
I'm looking for a Strut Jetstream.

326
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,809
- Who?
- Jetstream. Strut Jetstream.

327

Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
Do you have a photo?

328
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,605
Yeah, I got one right here.
No, I don't have a photo!

329
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,815
I have documentation that says

330
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,442
Strut Jetstream
lives in Propwash Junction.

331

Oh, whoa, whoa! Whoa,
wait a minute! Okay! Oh...

332
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,447
No, gosh I...

333
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,366
Hey, I'm Strut Jetstream.

334
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,994
Yeah! That's right!
(LAUGHS)

335

There he is, strutting on over here.

336

But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

- I am?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

338
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,088
It's actually pronounced
"Dusty Crophopper."

339
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,509
Dusty Crophopper.

340
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,220
Yeah. It's Scandinavian.

341
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,681
Right, and I'm Egyptian.

342
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,601
(SNIFFS) Googly moogly!
What is that smell?

343
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,644
-It's Vita-minamulch.
- Vita-mina-what?

344
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,439
The finest-smelling compost
this side of the Mississippi.

345
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,649
Original, creamy and chunky style.

346
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,111
(SNIFFS) Oh, yeah.
Smell that? It's like daffodils

347
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,406
and like Sunday dinner.
I just love it. I love it.

Y'all know that, right?

350
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,581
BOTH: Yeah.

351
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,167
Are you familiar with
the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

352
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,544
Oh, yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

353

-It's illegal.
- Totally illegal.

355
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,508
Wouldn't know what it looks like.
Yeah, you were saying?

356
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,471
That substance was found in the tank
of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

357
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,057
Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

Dusty's in the race! Dottie, he's in!

364
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,074
What? Are you serious?

365
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,325
Whoo! Dusty.

00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,077
DOTTIE: Don't do anything crazy.
Fly safe.

Man, it's going to be cool.

368
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,081
You're going to cross oceans
thousands of miles wide.

369

on the side of a mountain

spread over five countries.

What makes you say that?

380
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,817
You're going up against
the best racers in the world.

381
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,527
And some of them don't even finish.

382
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,945
You're sloppy on your rolls,

383
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,322
wide on your turns,
slow on your straightaways.

384

You've been watching me?

385

Yeah, watching you
make a fool out of yourself.

386
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,662
You need to be tighter getting
in and out of your knife-edge.

00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,746
Okay.

388
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,207
Any extra control input
costs you speed and seconds.

389

- So, you think I'm overcorrecting?
- Absolutely. Rookie mistake.

390
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,380
Are you giving me pointers?

00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,341
No! I'm telling you to forget
all this racing malarkey.

You don't think I know that?

395

flying back and forth

month after month, for years!

Not like you.

I've never flown over a thousand feet.

462

Are you kidding?

463
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,497
Scared of heights and you want to
race around the world?

464
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,375
Uh, Skip, during the attack
of Tujunga Harbor,

465
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,045
why, even the P-38s
had trouble at high altitudes.

466
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,173
Well, they didn't have to fly
over the Himalayas, did they?

467
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,884
I'll still be low to the ground,
just high up.

468
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,553
And after the war,
those 38s went on to win races.

469
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,888
Really? Is that true?

470
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,307
Yeah, true.
Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

- For real?
- Wait, it gets better.

472
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:53,188
In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger
averaged 337 miles per hour.

473
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,439
Wait, 337?

474
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:57,609
Well, actually 337.4, but they
round it down in the record books.

475
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,777
Why would you do that?

476
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,237
Some people just have
no respect for decimal points.

477
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,656
- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
- Why couldn't they round it up?

00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,242

- All right, all right.

479
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,453
So, you're a flat-hatter.
We'll work on that.

480
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,332
But for now let's see if we can turn
low and sloppy into low and fast.

01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,577
CAR: Who's that guy?

1542
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,899
Thanks, Skip.

1543
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,150
Don't thank me.

1544
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:08,280
I learned a lot more from you
than you ever learned from me.

1545
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,230
Attention on deck. Victory!

1546
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,481
ALL: Victory!

1547
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,111
It's an honor to be here.

1548
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,239
Hook them up.

1549
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,167
- You ready, wingman?
- Roger that.

1550
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,379
An honorary Jolly Wrench.
How's that feel, Dusty?

1551
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:06,505
It feels great!

1552
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,216
(LAUGHS) Back in the saddle again,
eh, Skipper?

1553
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:12,136
Well, they didn't have these fancy toys
the last time I did this.

1554
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,429
Nothing to it.

1555
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,015
They hook you up,
you nod to the shooter over there,

1556
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,224
and hang on!

1557
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,523
SKIPPER: Yeah!

1558
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:38,370
DUSTY: Last one back
to Propwash buys!

1559
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,747
SKIPPER: Ha-ha! You're on!

1560
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,831
