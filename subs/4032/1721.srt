1
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,340
<i>Hey, Aron here.</i>

2
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
<i>Leave a message.</i>

3
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,980
<i>Hey Aron.</i>

4
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,780
<i>Sonja here... again.</i>

5
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,140
<i>I know that you're probably gonna do</i>
<i>ways this week-end,</i>

6
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,180
<i>but listen, just think about</i>
<i>what we're gonna play, please,</i>

7
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,620
<i>'coz we have to decide</i>
<i>and we really need to practice.</i>

8
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,220
<i>Anyway, it'll be fun, I promise.</i>

9
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,660
<i>And, oh! Please call mom,</i>
<i>please 'coz she worries.</i>

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,300
<i>Which, you know, all right...</i>

11
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,620
<i>Later, A. Bye!</i>

12
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,060
It's Friday night!

13
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,540
April 25th, 2003.

14
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm just heading to Canyonlands

15
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,060
Just me, the music

16
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,540
and the night!

17
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Love it!

18
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,940
Blue John Canyon,

19
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,700
guide book says:

20
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,380
"1 h 30 min
to the Big Dropper."

21
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,780
I am to take 45 mins of that.

22
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,780
You're doing Blue John, too, huh?

23
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,780
No. Actually,
we're headed for the Dome.

24
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,540
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

25
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Hang on.

26
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,380
Oh, my God!

27
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,780
Let's see this.

28
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,380
You are... here.

29
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,060
We are?

30
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,020
- And...
- I knew that.

31
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,620
And, the Dome, is there.

32
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,140
I can take you that way if you like.

33
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,860
Sorry the...
Friday the 13th there.

34
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,780
Child killer look.

35
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,060
I'm only a psychopath on week days
and today is saturday, so...

36
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,500
Can't take this off... My face.

37
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Nice!

38
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
Aron.

39
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Kristi.

40
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,140
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

41
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,900
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

42
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,140
What do you say?

43
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,180
You're lost, I'm a guide...

44
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Feel good.

45
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,660
Why not.

46
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,140
- Sure.
- All right.

47
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
This way.

48
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,540
So you bike from Horseshoe.

49
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,900
Is that like 20 miles ?

50
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,140
17 on the odometer.

51
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,900
I thought it was 17.2!

52
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,540
17.3, actually.

53
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,060
You're one of those...

54
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,260
- I'm not one of those.
- You spend a lot of time out here?

55
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,060
That's my second home.

56
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,300
See?

57
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,020
There's the fork, right there.

58
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,180
We totally missed that.

59
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
Glad we bumped into you.

60
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,660
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

61
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,380
Exactly.

62
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,980
You go to the one place in America
you guaranteed not to run into a weirdo.

63
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,620
And what happen?!

64
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,420
All right.

65
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,380
So the guide book says

66
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,020
that the route's through here.

67
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,140
But I know a better way.

68
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,260
The cool way.

69
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,780
Guaranteed, best time you can have
with your clothes on.

70
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Although, it's better
with your clothes off.

71
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,900
It is a bit of a climb.

72
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,020
- We climb!
- And a bit of a squeeze.

73
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,740
We squeeze.

74
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,860
So you get us

75
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,980
all the way back in here,

76
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
and then you tell us
that you're not a guide.

77
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,900
Well no, I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really wanna do.

78
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,020
That's wonderful to hear.

79
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,500
I've always wanted to be a supermodel

80
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
but I don't think that's actually
gonna workout, you know?

81
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,780
Jesus!
What if these things move?

82
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,780
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

83
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,060
- Sure they will!
- What?!

84
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,620
Everything is moving all the time.
Let's just hope not today!

85
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Great.

86
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
All right.

87
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,540
Now, all you got to remember

88
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
is that everything will be okay.

89
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,380
Oh, my God!

90
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,260
- Oh, my God!
- Aron?

91
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,900
Are you okay?

92
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,060
Aron?

93
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,540
Listen to the guy, he is fine.

94
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,140
Yeah.

95
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,420
He's bad shit.

96
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
You're bad shit!

97
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,900
Come on!

98
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,380
You've got to come down here!

99
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,980
Trust me!

100
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,420
- Trust you? We'll kill you Aron!
- Oh, please.

101
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,020
You love this.

102
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Nice job!

103
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,900
- Megan, you're missing it!
- Come on, it's amazing!

104
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,300
- Oh, fuck, fuck.
- Just jump, Megan.

105
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,660
Fuck!

106
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
You okay?

107
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,540
- Nice job!
- I can't believe you did it!

108
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,820
- Okay, we have to do it again!
- Again?

109
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,780
Camera, camera!

110
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,900
So, Blue John,

111
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,420
is actually named after
this guy Blue John

112
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,940
who was Butch Cassidy's cook.

113
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,940
<i>From Butch Cassidy</i>
<i>and the Sundace Kid.</i>

114
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,540
And they would hide out
in these Canyons, I guess.

115
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,540
But also what they do
is they run wild horses into here

116
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,940
and they trap them
at the end of the Canyon.

117
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,420
That's how they caught the horses.

118
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,820
- One more picture before I go?
- Yeah!

119
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,820
Okay, cool.

120
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Ready?

121
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,060
One, two, three...

122
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,060
Blue John, blue cheese...
Well, will I ever see you again?

123
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,180
That depends. Do you party?

124
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,820
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

125
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,220
Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party
if you wanna come.

126
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,300
You should come by
and have a bear. Kick back.

127
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,700
Okay, where am I going?

128
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,180
It's about 20 miles away,
near Green River behind the old motel.

129
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,180
It's behind that. There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

130
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Really? Okay.

131
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,780
- Cool!
- Okay!

132
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,420
It was good to met you.

133
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,700
- See ya!
- Bye!

134
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,100
Scooby-Doo!

135
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,540
Rock on!

136
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,820
You think he's gonna show up?

137
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,580
I don't think
we figured in his day at all.

138
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,540
You liked him!

139
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,820
This is insane!

140
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,300
Move this fucking rock!

141
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,260
Please.

142
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,300
Oh, God.

143
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,620
Kristi!

144
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,860
Megan!

145
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,260
Is there anyone?!

146
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Think.

147
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
Just think.

148
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,700
Fuck!

149
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,140
Shit!

150
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,860
Shit!

151
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Fucker!

152
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,060
Sweet!

153
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,700
Knife is dull.

154
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,380
Look at the size of this one, man.
How the fuck did this get here?

155
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Okay.

156
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,700
Hey, buddy.

157
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Here we go.

158
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,740
It's 3:05,

159
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,060
on Sunday, April 26th,

160
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,380
2003.

161
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,180
This marks,

162
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,860
24 hours

163
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,660
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.

164
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,940
Right where it slots up
before the Big Drop.

165
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,300
My name is Aron Ralston,

166
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,700
my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado,

167
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,660
and...

168
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,340
Whoever find this
can keep the recorder.

169
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Just...

170
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Please try and get in touch
with my parents and give them this tape.

171
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,460
I'd appreciate it.

172
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,740
I was descending Blue John,

173
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,740
yesterday, when this

174
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
chockstone

175
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,860
came loose and rolled onto my arm

176
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,860
and now it's stuck and...

177
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,100
my thumb has this kind
of this gray-blue color.

178
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,900
It's been without circulation
for 24 hours.

179
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
So...

180
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
I think it's pretty well gone.

181
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm low on food.

182
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,980
That's about... 300-400 ml.

183
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,940
And that's it for water.

184
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,940
I'm in pretty deep doo here.

185
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,900
Please!

186
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,140
There's someone down here!

187
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,300
Help!

188
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,380
I'm in the Canyon!

189
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
<i>Help!</i>

190
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,540
<i>Help!</i>

191
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,300
<i>Down here!</i>

192
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,260
<i>Help!</i>

193
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,460
Don't loose it.

194
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Aron,

195
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,020
do not loose it.

196
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Not bad.

197
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Dinner.

198
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,860
<i>Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party</i>
<i>if you wanna come.</i>

199
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
<i>You should come by</i>
<i>and have a bear. Kick back.</i>

200
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,500
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.</i>

201
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,100
Scooby-Doo...

202
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,380
Mountain Dew?

203
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,820
Plastic cup.

204
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,580
Thank you.

205
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,380
Might take a beer as well.

206
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,020
Don't mind if I do?

207
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,500
<i>Aron here.</i>

208
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,700
<i>Leave a message.</i>

209
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,020
<i>Aron, it's mom.</i>

210
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,580
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>

211
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,140
<i>Are you there?</i>

212
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,580
<i>Hello?</i>

213
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,100
<i>Okay.</i>

214
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,740
<i>Nothing urgent.</i>

215
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,500
<i>Dad is in New York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

216
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,300
<i>Call me, okay?</i>

217
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,260
<i>Lost of love.</i>

218
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,460
Where are you going?

219
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,980
Don't know yet.

220
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,100
Right there, Brian.

221
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,180
Maybe you tell me
and I'll be somewhere else.

222
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,460
Have a good one.

223
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,660
Always do.

224
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,260
<i>Always do.</i>

225
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,060
Let's go.

226
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Crap.

227
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,340
This is freaking me out
looking at myself like that.

228
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,860
Sorry, I hope that's okay.

229
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,300
It's Monday.

230
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,860
Bummer, all day.

231
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,900
I tried to set up this pulley

232
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,620
all morning, but it didn't work.

233
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,900
It was worth a try

234
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,380
but there is too much friction
and it's...

235
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,140
a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

236
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,020
What I could really use is
about 20 meters of static rap rope,

237
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,420
9.8 mm.

238
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,820
3 or 4 pulleys,

239
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,300
A rack of carabiners, a sling,

240
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,860
power drill,

241
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,900
and a pull kit.

242
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,820
And 8 burly men
to do all the hawling.

243
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,420
That should just about do it.

244
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,020
I have...

245
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,220
150 ml of water left.

246
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,660
What should keep me alive till...

247
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,900
Tomorrow night.

248
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,380
If I'm lucky.

249
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,300
I peed twice.

250
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,340
I almost piss my pants.

251
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,540
My body is actually
acting really weird.

252
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,700
The second time,

253
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,700
I did it in the camelback.

254
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,260
It smells really bad.

255
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,060
But...

256
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,340
I'm sure it'll settle.

257
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,060
It's got to be chilled,
like Sauvignon Blanc.

258
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,060
No number twos.

259
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,140
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

260
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,660
They'll just have to wait.

261
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,660
Let's, see.
What else could I tell you?

262
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,620
There is this raven

263
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,660
that comes every morning.

264
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,700
I clocked it at 8:17.

265
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,060
I'll film it for you tomorrow.

266
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,820
Every morning at

267
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,820
9:30.

268
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,700
I get fifteen minutes of sunlight.

269
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,380
Really nice.

270
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,180
I've been chipping away.

271
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,900
More to...

272
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,180
More to keep warm than anything.

273
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,340
And I'm beginning to think
that my hand

274
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,340
is supporting the rock.

275
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,140
So when I chip away a little bit,
it actually settles more.

276
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,900
So...

277
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
I found this great tourniquet.

278
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,500
It hurts.

279
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,620
It hasn't been very useful.

280
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,220
Listen.

281
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,660
Don't buy the cheap

282
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,500
made-in-China multi-tool.

283
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,100
I tried to find
my Swiss Army knife, but...

284
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,060
This thing came free
with a flashlight.

285
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,780
The flashlight
was a piece of shit too.

286
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,620
I kept it in my truck
for emergencies.

287
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,620
Not that I'm blaming you, mom.

288
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,740
It was a...

289
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,740
perfectly great stocking stuffer.

290
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,060
There is no way you could have known
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

291
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,740
So you have to leave the camera to us
if we want to watch what you've made.

292
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,780
- Yeah.
- Good job, hon.

293
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,740
So he's filming her now.

294
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,260
And we see it there, live.

295
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,620
Well done, okay.

296
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,180
Way to go, sis.

297
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,900
<i>- Keep playing?</i>
- Yes, honey, keep going.

298
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,580
Fuck!

299
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,540
So...

300
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,260
How do I get in?

301
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,420
What's the...

302
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,220
you know...

303
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,340
combination?

304
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,460
If I told you,

305
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,700
I'd have to kill you.

306
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,900
You've already kill me.

307
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,820
Combination?

308
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,700
I think I have it.

309
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,180
Fuck.

310
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,020
Who's there?

311
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,900
Aron?

312
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,380
Please!

313
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,620
Please!

314
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,820
Please!

315
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,300
<i>- Good morning every body...</i>
<i>- It's the morning show...</i>

316
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,140
Good morning everyone!

317
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,460
It is seven o'clock here,
in Canyonlands, U.S.A.

318
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,580
And this morning, on the boulder,

319
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,140
we have a very special guest,

320
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,740
self-proclaimed American super hero...

321
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,700
Aron Ralston!

322
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,980
Let's hear it for Aron!

323
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,140
Hi, oh, gosh, it's...

324
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,980
It's a real pleasure to be here,
thank you.

325
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,300
Thank you.

326
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,260
Hey, can I say "hi"
to my mom and dad?

327
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,780
Mom and dad?
Mustn't forget mom and dad, right Aron?

328
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,420
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,020
Hey mom. I'm really sorry I...

330
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,420
I didn't answered the phone
the other night...

331
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,220
If I had I would have told you
where I was going an then...

332
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,300
I probably
wouldn't be here right now.

333
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,980
That's for sure!

334
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,300
But like I always say:

335
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,580
"Your supreme selfishness

336
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,700
"is our gain."

337
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,300
Thank you Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say "hi" to ?

338
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,940
- Brian, at work.
- Hi, Aron.

339
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,940
I probably won't be making it
in to work today.

340
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,660
Get a load of this guy!
Oh, wait, hold on.

341
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,300
We've got a question coming in

342
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,140
from another Aron,

343
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,140
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

344
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,660
Aron asks:

345
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,820
Am I right in thinking

346
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,740
even if Brian from work

347
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:00,140
notifies the police,
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it

348
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,220
before they file
a missing persons report,

349
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,500
which means
you won't become officially missing

350
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,820
until midday Wednesday
at the earliest?

351
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,220
Yeah, you're right
on the money there, Aron.

352
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,180
Which means,
I'll probably be dead by then.

353
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,900
Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah,
how do you know so much?

354
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,660
Well, I'll tell you
how I know so much.

355
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,660
I volunteer
for the rescue service.

356
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,900
You see, I'm some kind of a...

357
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,100
well, a big fucking heart hero.

358
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,780
And I can do

359
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,140
everything on my own, you see?

360
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,500
I do see!

361
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,740
Now...

362
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,380
Is it true

363
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,300
that despite,

364
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,100
or maybe because
you're a big fucking heart hero,

365
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,460
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

366
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,740
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

367
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,340
Anyone?

368
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,820
Anyone.

369
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,500
Mom, dad,

370
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,380
I just wanna take this time
to tell you that

371
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,420
the time we spent together
was awesome.

372
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,980
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart as I know that I could.

373
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,820
Mom,

374
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,500
I love you.

375
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,380
And I wish that I had returned
all your calls, ever.

376
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,220
I love you, guys.

377
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,260
And I'll always be with you.

378
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,020
This is no Slurpee.

379
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,460
It's like a bag of piss.

380
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,660
<i>I'm going again!</i>

381
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,540
<i>With clothes on.</i>

382
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:07,780
<i>- Megan, tell him.</i>
<i>- We're very worried about you.</i>

383
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,740
<i>We're worried</i>
<i>about your musical choices.</i>

384
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,060
<i>If you keep singing Phish</i>
<i>you'll never get a girlfriend.</i>

385
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,420
<i>You might have one,</i>
<i>but I really don't think you do.</i>

386
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,420
<i>- You may be sort of cute.</i>
<i>- Occasions are scarce for you.</i>

387
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,860
<i>Okay.</i>

388
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,940
<i>This canon ball is for you.</i>

389
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,340
<i>I'm going to...</i>

390
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,540
<i>I'm going to test your theory</i>
<i>about whether or not it's better</i>

391
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,180
<i>to do it without your clothes on.</i>

392
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,660
Don't...

393
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Don't...

394
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,700
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

395
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,220
You don't even want me here, do you?

396
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,820
I'm gonna go, Aron.

397
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,660
Is that what you want?

398
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,700
It is, isn't it?

399
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,220
Okay.

400
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,860
Come back.

401
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,620
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

402
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,900
<i>46, 47, 48...</i>

403
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,140
<i>49, 50! Aron, I'm coming!</i>

404
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,380
I'm holding on.

405
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,700
Time is moving really slowly.

406
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,660
My heart is beating really fast.

407
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,780
I swear to God, it feels like

408
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,140
it's beating like three times faster
than it should be.

409
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,460
So cold...

410
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,620
Blue John?

411
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,180
<i>You...</i>

412
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,740
Rana,

413
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,980
- I've been thinking about you girl.
<i>- I've been thinking about you girl.</i>

414
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,220
<i>I know how I am.</i>
<i>I tried to do everything.</i>

415
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,860
<i>How I was...</i>

416
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,100
<i>I tried.</i>

417
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,860
What you guys are doing here?

418
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,420
Eddy?

419
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,060
Tom?

420
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,900
Hey, guys. What's going on?

421
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,020
Eric?

422
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,580
Hey.

423
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,540
You look like the Hole
in the Wall Gang.

424
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,460
Dorks.

425
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,580
Found you, Aron.

426
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,060
Sis,

427
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,900
I'm sorry
that I won't be at your wedding.

428
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,980
I know that I promised to play.

429
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,580
That we play.

430
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,940
I'm sorry.

431
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,540
I know it'll be a good one.

432
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,900
8:15.

433
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,580
there's no raven.

434
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:29,860
8:20.

435
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,860
I didn't tell you
my raven didn't come.

436
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,220
I've been thinking,

437
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,220
everything is...

438
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,900
It just comes together.

439
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,140
<i>You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.</i>

440
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,660
<i>Always do.</i>

441
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,900
Later!

442
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,180
It's me.

443
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,900
<i>Aron, it's mom.</i>
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>

444
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,300
I chose this.

445
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,780
<i>Dad's in New-York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

446
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,180
I chose all of this.

447
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,780
Call me, okay?
Lots of love!

448
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,940
This rock,

449
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,060
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

450
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,820
I hate this rock!

451
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,260
In it's entire life.
Ever since it was a bit of meteorite.

452
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,740
A million billion years ago.

453
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,660
Up there in space.
It's been waiting...

454
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,140
to come here.

455
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,180
Right, right here.

456
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,860
I've been moving towards it
my hole life.

457
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,540
The minute I was born

458
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,260
every breath I've taken

459
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,900
every action

460
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,740
has been leading me to this

461
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,060
crack on the out surface.

462
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,940
Come on.

463
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,060
Don't pass out.

464
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
Thank you.

465
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:53,940
Easy.

466
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,140
Help!

467
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,340
Please!

468
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,660
Help me!

469
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,580
I need help!

470
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,380
I need agua...

471
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,420
I'm Aron Ralston.
Since Saturday I was trapped

472
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,180
by a boulder.

473
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,940
No water for 5 days.

474
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,100
I cut my arm off.

475
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:14,260
Please, some water.

476
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,820
Thank you.

477
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,660
- You've got a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

478
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,580
You should stop and rest.

479
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,740
No, I better keep going.

480
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,100
Can one of you run?

481
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,220
Can one of you run ahead?

482
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:59,140
{\He met his wife Jessica
three years later.}

483
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:13,260
{\Aron continues to be
a climber and a Canyoneer.}

484
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:25,700
{\He always leaves a note
to say where he has gone.}
