1
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,987
有时比起人类我更喜欢动物
Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes.

2
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,240
尤其是狗 狗最可爱
Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.

3
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,367
回家进门...
Every time you come through the door...

4
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,078
...它们对你就像一年没见的亲人
...they treat you as if they haven't seen you in a year.

5
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,830
狗最大的好处是...
The good thing about dogs...

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,208
...不同的人可以养不同的狗
...is they got different kinds of dogs for difforent kinds of people.

7
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,377
比如斗牛犬
Like pit bulls.

8
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,296
狗中之最
The dog of dogs.

9
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,091
斗牛犬能成为某些人最好的朋友...
Pit bull can be the right man's best friend...

10
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,385
...另一些人最可怕的敌人
...and the wrong man's worst enemy.

11
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,265
你要送狗给我当宠物 就送斗牛犬 给我...
Yeah, you gonna give me a dog, give me a pit bull. Give me...

12
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,019
..."拉乌尔" 好吗 奥马尔? 把拉乌尔给我
..."Raoull." Right, Omar? Give me Raoull.

13
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,023
我讨厌拉乌尔 闭嘴 混蛋
I fucking hate Raoull! Shut the fuck up, asshole!

14
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,442
该死的畜生不懂何时该闭嘴!
Son of a bitch don't know when to shut up!

15
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,902
他恨拉乌尔
Hates Raoull.

16
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,071
法利搞错了
Farley fucked up the list.

17
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,951
我能理解 我有只狗也这样 一只卷毛狗
Yeah, I can dig it, Omar. I had a dog like that. A poodle.

18
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,163
它不乱叫 可总是尿在地板上
She didn't bark, though. She pissed on the floor.

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,624
我讨厌它
Hated that dog.

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,918
可每当我心情不好时...
But if I was ever depressed...

21
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,961
...它就把头靠在我腿上...
...she'd lay her head in my lap...

22
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,839
...睁着大眼睛望着我...
...look up at me with those big old eyes...

23
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,092
...虽然我觉得我讨厌它...
...and even though I thought I hated that dog...

24
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,636
...其实我爱它
...I loved her.

25
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,098
你是不是也有这种感觉? 爱恨交加
It's like that, ain't it, Omar? That love-hate thing.

26
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,809
别再说废话了!
No more goddamned talk!

27
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,356
我不想等了 听见没有? 我要见我老婆!
I can't wait anymore, you hear me? I want my Wife!

28
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,358
让她马上来!
I want her up here.

29
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,861
不见我就杀了女儿
Or I'll do our daughter.

30
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,492
- 奥马尔 听我说 - 少废话
- Omar, listen to me. - No more fucking talking.

31
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,661
那贱女人不来 我就杀了女儿
I want that bitch, or I'll do the girl.

32
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,247
我在尽最大努力
Omar, I'm doing the best I can here, man.

33
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,499
我不伤害她
I'm not gonna hurt her.

34
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,834
只想让她看着我打烂自己的头
I just want her to see me blow my brains out.

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,670
让她和别人鬼混时...
I want her to think about that...

36
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,839
...想着我的样子
...when she's sucking that fat prick's cock.

37
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,807
罗曼劝不了他
Roman's losing him.

38
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,686
这家伙急了会杀孩子 我们马上冲进去
This guy goes' he could take that girl With him. We gotta go in.

39
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,523
再给丹尼点时间 已有进展了
We'll give Danny another minute. Not yet. He's pulled out of worse.

40
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,317
再等下去那女孩会送命
Another minute, that girl will be dead.

41
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,782
第1小组准备进入 其他各组待命全面攻击
Unit 1, prepare entry. All units stand by for full breach.

42
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,625
回来! 回来!
Get back! Get back!

43
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,217
谈判无效 准备进入
You lost him. Make entry.

44
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,012
贝克认为谈判失败 弗罗斯批准他采取行动
Beck thinks you lost him. Frost gave him the go-ahead.

45
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,055
这不符合程序 奥马尔醉了
That's not the play. Omar's tight.

46
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,641
他有足够时间开枪
He can get a shot off if they breach.

47
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,394
我能继续跟他谈 给我点时间
Look, Nate' I can still talk to him. I just need time.

48
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,481
- 特别行动队 谈判专家需要时间  - 不行 突击队已就位
- HBT 1, negotiator requests time. - Negative. Team's in position.

49
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,901

No. Don't, damn it. Don't pull this shit. You'll give him another hostage.

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,908
你有别的办法让他把枪从女孩头上移开?
You know another way to get the gun off the girl's head?

52
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,079
- 谈判专家进入危险区  - 必须让他马上离开
- Negotiator entering kill zone. - You better keep him out.

53
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,373
他会扰乱队员的注意力
Our men will lose objectivity if he's in there.

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,001
我是弗罗斯 别进去

- We have a shot? - Bedroom, but he's nowhere near.

57
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,011
他会在射程内 让伊戈尔和巴勒莫瞄准窗口
He will be. Get Eagle and Palermo to that Window.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,848
看我的手势 从背后把他撂倒
Tell them to wait for my signal and put that motherfucker on his back.

59
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,683
赫尔曼 埃伦 阿尔金托

我要先见她
I wanna see her first.

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,727
慢慢走进来
Nice and slow!

I gotta look in those rooms down there. You know, make sure nobody's there.

86
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,558

是个比赛的好日子
Perfect day for it.

离开海军陆战队后 我没错过一场熊队的主场比赛
I ain't missed a Bears home game since I left the Corps.

90
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,200
当然陆战队是常胜队
Course, the Corps Was a winning team, wasn't it?

91
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,202
你也曾是陆战队员?

"呼拉"!
Hoorah!

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,092
很少遇到陆战队员 现在人人都加入海军
Don't meet many Marines these days. Everybody joins the Navy.

97
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,763
我看见疑犯

Like I told you, gotta check out everything.

101
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,911
一个水兵和一个陆战队员上厕所撒尿
Omar. A Marine and a sailor are in the bathroom taking a piss.

00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,748
尿完陆战队员没洗手就走
The Marine goes to leave without Washing up.

103
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,542
水兵说:

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,295
"在海军 上级教我们便后洗手"
"In the Navy' they teach us to wash our hands."

105
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,340
陆战队员转身对他说:
The Marine turns to him and says:

106
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,885
"在陆战队 上级教我们别尿在手上"
"In the Marines, they teach us not to piss on our hands."

No, it was a team effort. I just talked the guy out.

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,975
他有没有说这样做的原因?
Well, did he say anything in there?

128
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,687
他只是想大出风头!
He just wanted to hog the spotlight!

129
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,774
今天我差点让你滚蛋 因为你不听话
I just wanna tell you how close I came to busting your ass because of that shit.

132
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,117
说真的那确实需要胆量
Danny, off the record, that was one hell of a gutsy job, man.

133
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,952
再次祝贺你

136
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,790
你真参加过海军陆战队?
Were you really in the Marines?

137
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,126
不 我在陆军而且我最讨厌狗
No, I was in the Army and I fucking hate dogs.

138
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,215
尽管今天的结局不错 可你让我的人身陷危险
Despite how things worked out today, you put these guys in jeopardy.

139
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,094
你若成了人质后果将不堪设想
If you were taken hostage, you would've fucked up everything.

140
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,806
所有人都活着 包括你
Everybody lived, Beck. Even you.

141
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:06,402
好好玩
Play

142
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,775
芝加哥有两万警察 不能轮流吗?
Twenty thousand cops in Chicago. Can't you take turns?

143
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,153
本来打算让内森进去...
I was gonna let Nate go in...

144
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,655
...可我知道琳达会生我气
...but I knew Linda would be pissed at me.

145
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,324
这点内森比你聪明得多
Nate's much smarter than that, right, Nate?

146
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,578
我太聪明 有时聪明反被聪明误
Yeah, I'm too smart. I'm too smart for my own good sometimes.

147
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,124
我要跟你谈谈 有件事很重要
You got a minute? Gotta talk. It's important.

148
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,085
只占你一点时间 我保证就几分钟
Just be a minute, I promise. Just a minute.

149
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,338
去吧 谈你们的秘密
Go on, tell your secrets.

150
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,382
天哪
Man

151
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,358
最近有人主动跟我联系
I was approached by someone recently.

152
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,696
他知道谁偷了伤残基金的钱
He knows who took money from the disability fund.

153
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,448
什么?
What?

154
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,617
- 丢了近200万美元  - 我知道
- Almost 2 million is missing. - Yeah, I know.

155
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,121
据他说 偷钱的人咱们认识 是警察
According to him, we know the guys who took it. Cops.

156
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,333
局里的同事 我们称为朋友的人...
Guys in our own precinct. Guys we might call our friends...

157
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,376
...在偷我们自己的钱
...stealing our own money.

158
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,671
该早些告诉你 可我一直没机会
I would've told you sooner, but this is my first chance.

159
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,507
是谁告诉你的?
Who told you this?

160
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,717
我不能说...
I can't say...

161
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,095
...他知道自己在说什么
...but this guy knows what he's talking about.

162
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,140
74年起就从事这方面工作 一直办这类案子是这方面权威
He's been around' working cases like this. He knows his shit.

163
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,184
他为什么不找内务监察部?
So why didn't he go to Internal Affairs?

164
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,854
因为内务监察部也不干净
Because he thinks Internal Affairs is involved.

165
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,066
他听见尼鲍姆的名字 不知如何是好
He heard Niebaum's name mentioned. He doesn't know what to do.

166
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,695
他们出钱要收买他
They offered to buy him out.

167
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,824
- 结果? - 他说要考虑一下
- And? - And he said he'd think about it.

168
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,410
我们是警校同学 又同在6分局工作过 所以他信任我
We were at the academy' worked Area 6 together, so he trusts me.

169
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,246
可是他...
This guy' uh...

170
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,082
他真的怕得要命
Dan, this guy is really scared.

171
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,709
你什么时候知道这些事的?
When did you find out about all this?

172
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,797
大部份是昨天晚上...
Most of it last night, but I' uh...

173
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,050
可我已调查了两个星期
I've been Working on it for a couple of Weeks now, you know?

174
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,679
你是委员会成员 也许听到消息
I figured that With you on the board you might have heard something.

175
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,472
没有
No.

176
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,765
我什么也没听说
I didn't hear a thing.

177
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,687
他们查过帐 可什么也没发现
Well' they did do an audit' but it didn't prove anything.

178
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,567
若有人偷我们的钱 我们必须找出是谁
If somebody's stealing our money, we gotta find out who.

179
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,776
你把这消息告诉...
You tell this informant...

180
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,738
- 真见鬼  - 我的上帝!
- Oh, shit. - Jesus Christ!

181
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,948
秃头警官!
Officer Bald.

182
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,243
你俩躲在这里干什么? 同性恋?
Are you blowing each other?

183
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,287
你来捣乱坏了我们的好事
About to, till you showed up.

184
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,790
我知道你们搭档的事 可大家都在找你们
I know you're all partners, but everyone's looking for you.

185
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,792
别瞎猜 警官
Don't shine the light in here, officer.

186
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,795
男人不能和搭档拉手?
Can't a guy just hold his partner's hand?

187
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,381
那我就不打扰二位了
I'll let you girls be.

188
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,303
- 把你嘴巴擦干净  - 给我带瓶啤酒过来 大个子
- Wipe that stuff oft your mouth, buddy. - Yeah. Order me a drink, big guy.

189
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,513
天哪
Jesus.

190
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,641
- 咱们再找时间谈吧 - 好的
- We'll finish this later. - Yeah, all right.

191
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,606
别告诉琳达
Yeah. Don't tell Linda.

192
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,817
该死
Shit.

193
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,697
我不想有一天我一个人修房子 丹尼
I don't like the thought of fixing up this house alone, Danny.

194
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,324
可你干这些事...
And with what you're doing...

195
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,161
亲爱的 这是我的工作
Nuh-uh-uh. Darling, that's the job.

196
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,830
问题不在工作
It's not the job.

197
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,335
我能忍受你的工作 可不能忍受你玩命
The job I can deal with. It's how you do the job.

198
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,837
- 就像你今天的行为 - 我没事
- Like what you did today. - I'm fine.

199
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,422
这次没事
This time.

200
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,217
我喜欢你做事有股疯狂劲
What I love about you is that you do these crazy things.

201
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:33,181
但我要区别疯狂和愚蠢是两码事
It's just that I wish you'd start differentiating betWeen crazy and stupid.

202
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,725
我知道婚姻对你是个新领域...
I know this whole marriage thing is new to you...

203
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,520
...不过每晚回家是其重要组成部份
...but coming home every night is a big part of it.

204
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,189
每晚回家
Every night.

205
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,483
我保证...
Okay. I promise...

206
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,694
...我每天晚上都回家
...I Will come home every night.

207
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,367
无论有多重要的事
No matter what I have to do.

208
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,036
每晚回家
Every night.

209
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,124
你想和谁谈判? 你忘了我知道你的工作就是撒谎
What are you trying to negotiate? You forget that I know you lie for a living.

210
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,751
- 现在不是  - 噢!
- Not right now. - Oh!

211
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,253
听着
Listen' listen.

212
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,216
丹尼・罗曼是有家的男人了
Danny Roman is a married man now.

213
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,344
别再干蠢事了
No more crazy shit, all right?

214
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,515
看见了?
See that?

215
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,851
公共汽车 车沿着大街开走了
That's the bus. The bus is going down the street.

216
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,772
蠢事就在车上
Crazy is on the bus.

217
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,780
什么东西在震动?
What's vibrating' baby?

218
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,000
(11:30弗兰克林公园见内森)

219
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,161
内森在震动
Nate is vibrating.

220
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,874
去吧 代我向内森问好
Go. Tell Nate I said hello.

221
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,671
说我希望他让你远离麻烦
And that I expect him to keep you out of trouble from now on.

222
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,102
(11:30弗兰克林公园见丹尼)

223
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,118
你好吗? 抓到我抽烟了
Hey, how you doing? Caught me. Heh, heh.

224
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
丹尼刚呼了我 出了什么事?
Look, Danny beeped me earlier. What's going on?

225
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,293
内森?
Nate?

226
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,520
不许动!
Freeze!

227
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,022
把手举起来!
Get your hands up!

228
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,858
我是警察! 有警员中枪!
Police officer! Officer down!

229
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,114
他说昨晚和告密人谈过
He said he talked to his informant last night.

230
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,535
他的警校同学 6分局的同事
Some guy he was at academy with and knew from Area 6.

231
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,373
这人说他知道退休基金的事
This guy said he knew what Was going down with the pension fund.

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,419
告密人没来找你们...
The informant didn't come to you guys...

233
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,801
...是因为他知道内务监察部有人参与
...because he thought someone from Internal Affairs was involved.

234
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,221
我们中的一个?
One of us?

235
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,103
这告密人究竟是谁? 中尉
Exactly who was this informant, lieutenant?

236
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,230
他没说那人的名字
Hey, he didn't tell me his name.

237
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,901
显然有人发现内森根据告密人提供的线索...
It's obvious somebody found out Nate Was investigating the fund...

238
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,404
...在调查基金的事就把他杀了
...off this informant's tip and they took him out.

239
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,032
我们把整件事再从头说一遍
Let's go back to the beginning and do this whole thing again.

240
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,077
我只是发现搭档被人打死
Hey, hey' hey. I just found my partner with his head blown off.

241
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,705
- 我不喜欢被审问!  - 这由不得你
- I don't feel like doing this! - You're gonna have to.

242
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,998
- 见你的鬼去吧!  - 别逼他
- Fuck this! - Back off.

243
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,918
别逼他 尼鲍姆 另找时间谈吧
Back off' Niebaum. We'll do it some other time, okay?

244
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,553

247
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,540
准备 瞄准 射击

249
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,884
瞄准 射击
Aim. Fire.

250
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,641
- 是有人敲门吗?  - 你去开
- Is that the door? - Mm. You get it.

251
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,101
该死
Shit.

252
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,071
丹尼 听着 杀死内森的枪找到了
Hey, Danny, listen, they found the gun that killed Nathan.

253
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,742

- It's in the lake. No fingerprints. - Hang on. He's...

254
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,744
- 我们有搜查令... - 慢着
- I have a search warrant... - Just hold it.

255
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,789
枪上的编号... 是一毒贩被盗3支枪之一
Danny, the serial number on the gun... It was one of three stolen from a dealer.

256
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,084
另两支7个月前被你找到
Two of the guns were recovered by you around seven months ago.

257
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,755
- 记得吗? 第3支枪刚找到  - 你在开玩笑
- The third gun Was not found until now. - You gotta be fucking kidding me.

258
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,923
- 你说真的? - 我们无能为力
- You serious? - Nothing we can do.

259
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,344
听说签发搜查令我们尽快赶来
We came as soon as we heard they were issuing a Warrant.

260
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,555
- 规矩点 他是自己人  - 进来
- Guys, go easy. He's one of ours. - In here. In here.

261
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,025
对不起 凯伦 我们知道这是胡扯
I'm sorry about this' Karen. We all know it's bullshit.

262
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,277
让他们干完就会走的
Just let them do their work and get out.

263
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,404
这是胡扯
It is bullshit.

264

...I look fat in ski clothes.

528
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,774
这不是她用的词 她说的...
That's not the word she used. She used...

529
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,778
...比这更难听
...a much worse word.

530
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,199
宝贝 挂上电话!
Honey' get off the phone!

531
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,992
- 挂上电话  - 我知道
- Get off the phone. - I know.

532
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,286
- 挂上电话  - 不
- Get off the phone. - No.

533
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,248
我是你爸爸 现在我对你很生气
I'm your father and I'm very upset with you right now.

534
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,959
试试新毛衣
Try your sweater.

535
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,086
宝贝 挂上电话
Honey' but get off the phone.

536
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,963
我要你向妈妈道歉...
I want you to apologize...

537
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,215
...因为你说她像...
...to your mother for saying she looks...

538
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,800
..."肥婆"
..."wide."

539
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,054
这词不好 肥婆
That's not a good Word to use, wide.

540
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,639
你愿意别人叫你肥婆?
how'd you like to be called wide?

541
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,641
听见了? 我是认真的
You hear me? I'm very serious.

542
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,851
我很生气!
I'm very angry with you!

543
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,312
马上挂上电话! 挂上电话
Right now. Get off the phone. Get off the phone.

544
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,689
- 不 - 别逼我...
- No. - Don't you make me...

545
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,149
嘘
Shh.

546
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,694
我说服过要炸掉希尔斯大厦的人...
I talked a man out of blowing up the Sears Tower...

547
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,947
...却无法让妻子走出卧室 让女儿挂上电话
...but I can't talk my wife out of a bedroom or my kid off a phone.

548
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:47,160
因为没有举着枪的人站在你身后
That's because no one's standing behind you with a big gun.

549
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,495
对 我保留意见
Yeah, well, that's debatable.

550
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,248
等一下
Hold on.

551
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,584
喂?
Hello?

552
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,127
对 他在家
Yeah. He's right here.

553
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,837
找你的
It's for you.

554
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,590
喂?
Hello?

555
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,180
塞比安20分钟赶到
Sabian's 20 minutes out.

556
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,557
只剩15分钟
And we only got 15.

557
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,018
再给丹尼打电话 让他推迟期限
All right, call Danny and change that deadline.

558
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,854
告诉他塞比安正往这里赶
Tell him Sabian's on his way.

559
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,698
塞比安?
Sabian?

560
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,868
我是法利
No, it's, um, Farley.

561
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,455
法利 我说过 我只跟克瑞斯・塞比安谈
Look, Farley, I told you, I don't wanna talk to anyone but Chris Sabian.

562
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,874
他在来的路上
Yeah, uh, he's on his way, okay?

563
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,710
他很快就到 多给我们一点时间
He's gonna be here real soon. We just need more time.

564
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,629
你们没有时间了
You don't have more time, Farley.

565
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,214
丹尼 拜托 告诉我
Danny, please, tell me.

566
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,966
你这是干什么? 这事闹得很严重
What are you doing here, okay? This is pretty serious.

567
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,886
这事当然很严重 你们最好认真对待
You're goddamn right! So why don't you take me seriously?

568
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,388
是的 我们只是...
Well' we are. We are. We just' um...

569
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,392
- 我只想和你谈谈 - 等等
- It just, um... I just want to talk to you. - Wait, wait.

570
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,562
等等 你以为你能说服我 法利?
Wait, Wait. You think you can talk me down, Farley?

571
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,191
听我说 我需要...
Look, um, I need to, um...

572
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,402
告诉我你想要什么?
Tell me what you want, all right?

573
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,488
好的 法利
Okay, Farley.

574
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,616
你想试试? 我给你个机会
You want a shot? I'll give you a shot.

575
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,869
塞比安到达前还有时间
Yeah. We got some time before Sabian gets here.

576
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:16,541
我想要什么? 让我想想 这样吧... 能让我见牧师吗?
Oh. What do I want? Um, let's see. how about... Can I see a priest?

577
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,335
不 你不能见牧师
No, you can't see a priest.

578
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,588
很好 法利 你不应该让我见牧师
That's good, Farley. Good. You shouldn't let me see a priest.

579
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:26,717
牧师让人联想到死亡 此刻你不愿让我想到死
A priest is associated With death, and you don't want me thinking about death.

580
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,053
不 不
No, no.

581
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,639
可你刚才说"不" 你不能说"不"
But you told me "no." You can't say "no."

582
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,559
解救人质时永远不要说"不"
Never use "no" in a hostage situation.

583
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,353
- 放松点  - 我很放松!
- Would you relax? - I'm very fucking relaxed!

584
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,063
让我给你点忠告:
But let me give you some adNice:

585
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,733
对挟持人质的人不要说"不" 手册上有
Never say "no" to a hostage-taker. It's in the manual.

586
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,945
- 你还要对我说"不"吗?  - 不 我不说
- now, are you gonna tell me "no" again? - No, I'm not.

587
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,116
答错了 把"不"字从你的字典上抹掉
Wrong answer! Eliminate "no" from your vocabulary.

588
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,411
永远不要说"不" "不行" "不可以"
Never use "no," "don't," "won't" or "can't," all right?

589
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,163
这样说堵死退路 留下唯一选择...
It eliminates options. The only option that leaves...

590
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,207
...是杀掉人质 懂吗?
...is to shoot someone. Understand?

591
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,961
- 是的 - 很好 说"是"就对了
- Uh, yes. Yes, I do. - Yes! Good! See, "yes" is good.

592
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,673
再说"不" 我就要杀人了 练习一遍
Say "no" again, I'll kill somebody, all right? now, let's practice.

593
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,924
我能见牧师吗?
Can I see a priest?

594
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,595
我们能不能谈谈这件事...
Uh, let's not... You know what? Can We just talk...

595
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,265
如你所愿 咱们正在谈! 我能见牧师吗?
You wanted to talk. We are talking. now, can I see a priest?

596
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,642
让我想想办法
Uh, I'll see what I can do.

597
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,812
很好 你学得很快
That's good, Farley. now you're learning.

598
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,816
我要支冲锋枪 将人质都杀死
I'd like a submachine gun, so I can blow everyone away.

599
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,819
- 让我研究一下  - 干得不错 法利
- I'll look into that. - Good. uou're doing good, Farley.

600
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,905
你有没有对太太不忠?
You ever cheat on your wife?

601
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,825
- 不 - 小心 我要杀人了
- No. - Watch yourself. I'll kill someone.

602
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,120
你有没有对太太不忠? 回答我!
You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!

603
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,997
让我研究一下
I'll see what I can do.

604
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,293
我得想个好办法
I'll haVe to think about that. Um, I'll look into that.

605
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,170
你有没有...
You ever, um...

606
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,173
...扮成女生让别人打你屁股?
...dress up like a schoolgirl and get you ass spanked?

607
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,135
丹尼 听着 我只是想跟你谈谈
Danny, look, okay, all right, all I wanna do is talk to you.

608
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,512
我正在跟你谈 你有没有...
I am talking! now, did you or did you not...

609
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,766
...扮女生让别人打你屁股?
...ever dress up like a schoolgirl and get your ass spanked?

610
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,102
- 这事我得查一下  - 天啊 丹尼
- Have to look into that, Danny. - Jesus, Farley.

611
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:05,858
没有法律规定你不能男扮女装 可我以前真不了解你
Nothing against you dressing up like a girl, but I didn't know that about you, Farley.

612
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,695
- 这样做不能解决问题  - 不解决问题?
- Danny, this is really unproductive. - Unproductive?

613
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,614
你说的对
You're right. It is.

614
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,493
给我讲个笑话 你会讲笑话吗?
So tell me a joke, Farley. You know any jokes?

615
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,786
- 不 我...  - 不?
- No. - No?

616
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,538
你断送一条人命 法利 游戏结束!
You just cost someone their life, Farley! Game over!

617
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,458
开枪了
Shot fired.

618
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,380
开枪了 开枪了 看见什么了?
Shot fired. Shot fired. Can anyone see?

619
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,720
别让他挂电话
Don't let him go.

620
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,227
你不能说服我! 不能让我延长期限!
You can't talk me down! You can't make me change the deadline!

621
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,437
快找塞比安!
now get me Sabian!

622
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:47,566
你们还有6分42秒 41...
You got six minutes, 42, 41...

623
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,403
- 40! - 丹尼 有人受伤吗?
- Forty! - Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt?

624
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,570
有人受伤吗?
Is anybody hurt?

625
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,032
我们没事 别再说不了 蠢货!
We're okay. Just don't be saying "no" no more, motherfucker!

626
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,743
该死!
Oh' fuck.

627
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,579
- 保持镇静 - 对不起 我很抱歉
- Everybody calm down. - I'm so sorry. No, I'm so sorry.

628
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,415
我非常抱歉
I'm so fucking sorry.

629
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,333
报告情况
Give me status.

630
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,086
告诉我你们看见什么
Somebody give me status. Tell me what you see.

631
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,005
能见度零
Visibility zero, sir.

632
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,552
几分钟前...
Just a few moments ago...

633
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,472
...市府大楼内一声枪响
...a single shot was fired inside the city administration building.

634
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,725
我们在下面听不见...
We, of course, could not hear it down here...

635
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,936
全芝加哥都在看着我们
We got the whole city of Chicago watching this.

636
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,606
这会成为警方的噩梦
This could turn into a press nightmare.

637
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,862
万一塞比安到不了怎么办?
What do we do if Sabian can't make it?

638
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,782
别忘了上面是丹尼・罗曼
We gotta remember that that's Danny Roman upstairs.

639
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,453
我们和他共事12年 还不知道他究竟干了什么
We've worked with the guy for 12 years and don't really know what he's done.

640
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,663
知道他正在干什么
We know what he's doing now.

641
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,461
我不希望掺杂个人情绪
I don't want this to get personal for us.

642
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,381
他显然已经... 别偷听
He's obviously over... Hey, do you mind?

643
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,599
他显然已经疯了
He's obviously gone over the edge.

644
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,142
这与交情无关
This is not personal.

645
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,481
若派人冲进去 会给更多人带来危险...
If I thought sending these guys, my team in would put more people in jeopardy...

646
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,608
...我不会同意
...I Wouldn't consider it.

647
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,197
我也不想冲进去 可这是唯一的办法
I don't wanna go in there, but it's our best option.

648
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,990
没人能说服他
He can't be talked down.

649
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,036
会来人救我们出去 别担心丹尼
They'll get us out. Don't worry about Danny.

650
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,038
- 他不会伤害任何人  - 胡说
- He's not gonna hurt anybody. - Bullshit.

651
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,166
谁知道这疯子要干什么
No one knows what this crazy fucker is gonna do.

652
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,502
这事与我和麦琪无关
This has nothing to do with me and Maggie.

653
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,171
你和他老交情了 你让他放了我们
You know, you're his friend. You get him to let us go.

654
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,674
你习惯了奴役的镣铐...
Because once you familiarize yourself with the chains of bondage...

655
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,719
...就会主动向它伸出四肢
...you prepare your own limbs to wear them.

656
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,222
亚伯拉罕・林肯说的 我信
Fucking Abraham Lincoln said that and I believe it.

657
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,683
你必须让他马上放了我们!
So you have gotta get me the fuck out! now!

658
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,355
鲁迪 闭嘴 我们能处理
Do yourself a favor and keep quiet. We'll handle this.

659
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,150
别告诉我闭嘴 别告诉我你能处理...
Don't tell me to be quiet and don't tell me you can fucking handle it...

660
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,320
...你们谁也没经历过这场面
...because none of you ever been in a situation like this before.

661
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,698
- 你给我闭上嘴  - 去你妈的!
- Just shut the fuck up. - Fuck you!

662
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,992
- 鸟人  - 别吵了
- Prick. - All right, that's enough.

663
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,496
他在外面能听见 枪在他手里 所以得听他的
He's gonna hear you out there, and he's got the gun' so he's in charge.

664
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,040
你们都小点声
Both of you need to pipe down.

665
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:16,382
丹尼 放麦琪走 她与此事无关
Danny. I think you should let Maggie go. She's not involved.

666
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,217
她是女人 别把她扯进来...
She's a woman, and it's only fair...

667
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,720
别因为我是女人放我 我讨厌这理由
I didn't ask to be let go because I'm a woman. I hate that crap.

668
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,183
我和他应该走 我们与此事无关
Me and him should be let go because we had nothing to do with this.

669
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,103
- 这是你们警察之间的事  - 跟我们没一点关系
- It's between you cops. - We have nothing to do with this.

670
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,149
丹尼 听着 我已不是街头...
Danny, Danny, look' I'm not some just dirt merchant...

671
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,942
...卖假情报的混混了
...loose in the street anymore.

672
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,571
我不是 我有了不错的新女友 我想回去
I'm not. I got a nice new lady friend that I would like to get back to.

673
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,658
她有个孩子 是个好孩子
And she has got this kid, Albert. Ah, super kid, Dan.

674
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,120
- 他很棒  - 你还能怎么样?
- Great kid. - Dan, what do you think you can do?

675
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,997
看看电视
Take a look at that screen.

676
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,043
他们认为你是杀人犯 会设法干掉你
They think you're a killer, Danny. They're gonna try to take you out.

677
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,422
塞比安能做什么? 他无法阻止他们
What do you think Sabian can do? He can't do anything to stop this.

678
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,424
你呢 弗罗斯?
What about you' Frosty?

679
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,968
你也认为我是杀人犯?
You think I'm a killer too, huh?

680
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,303
拜托
Come on.

681
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,514
你认识我20年了
You've known me for 20 years.

682
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,434
你认为内森是我杀的?
You think I killed Nate?

683
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,066
我不知道 丹尼
I don't know what to think, Danny.

684
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,861
我要告诉你 丹尼小子:
I'll tell you this' Danny boy:

685
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,906
你这样做于事无补
What you're doing is not helping.

686
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,884
嘿 学生妹
Hey, schoolgirl.

687
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,139
还在为刚才差劲的表现沮丧?
You still sweating that ugly display you gave us all a few minutes ago?

688
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,894
别再抵毁自己了 我们都有过糟糕的日子
Stop kicking yourself in the ass. We all have our bad days. Beck.

689
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,272
贝克 别想攻进来 我的防守很坚固
Stop trying to figure out how to get in here. L'm well bunkered.

690
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,609
巴勒莫 嘴里别叨着牙签
Palermo, take that toothpick out of your mouth.

691
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,904
万一有情况 我不想你把它吞下去
Wouldn't want you to swallow it if something goes down.

692
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,156
好了 伙计们...
That's right, sports fans...

693
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,242
...是我 丹尼・罗曼
...it's me, Danny Roman.

694
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,410
我在楼上
The man upstairs.

695
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,498
戏开幕前想和大家打个招呼
Just wanted to say hello before the curtain goes up on this little drama.

696
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,794
你们都想知道为什么来这里
I guess you're all wondering why we're here.

697
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,837
很简单
Well' it's simple.

698
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,424
我们要查出谁偷了我们的钱...
We're here to find out who took our money...

699
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,011
...谁杀害了内森 因为不是我干的
...and who killed Nate' because it Wasn't me.

700
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,806
我们中出了坏警察...
There's some bad cops among us...

701
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,601
...今天我们要查出是谁
...and today we're gonna find out who they are.

702
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,187
我知道你们不信
now, I know how that sounds.

703
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,189
知道你们在想:
I know what you're thinking:

704
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,109
"他疯了 他是凶手"
"He's gone. He's a murderer."

705
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,363
可我还是那个与你们生死与共的臭小子...
But I'm that same son of a bitch you trusted your lives With...

706
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,324
...一起打球 一起喝酒
...played softball with, went drinking with.

707
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:52,329
还是那个你邀请回家庆祝儿子洗礼的人 唐瑞
I'm the same guy you invited to your house to celebrate your kid's baptism, Tonray.

708
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,456
还是那个在体育场...
The same guy who saved Palermo's ass...

709
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,626
...从狙击手枪下救过巴勒莫一命的人
...when that sniper had a bead on him at the stadium gig.

710
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,087
好极了
This is good, huh?

711
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,841
丹尼想激起我们同情 好让我们下不了手
Danny,s trying to get us to Stockholm so we think twice about taking him out.

712
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,677
现在我要...
now, I want...

713
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,388
我需要你们大家...
No, I need you guys...

714
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,224
...明白我别无选择
...to understand that I had no choice here.

715
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,228
我的生活被剥夺
My life was being stripped away from me.

716
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,731
先是他们杀了内森
First, they kill Nate.

717
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,737
后来收走我的警徽
Then they took my badge.

718
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,739
现在是你们
Then you guys.

719
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,824
下一步...
Next...

720
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,287
...他们要送我进监狱 让我失去妻子
...they were gonna take away my wife by sending me to prison.

721
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,331
这回...
And that...

722
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,666
...我忍无可忍
...I cannot take.

723
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,003
没她我活不下去...
I can't live without...

724
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,178
你们设身处地想想
Put yourself in my position.

725
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,097
我还能怎么办?
What else could I do?

726
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,726
通知队员改用第3频道
Get word out to our team. We're switching to frequency three.

727
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,102
- 是  - 快点办
- Yes, sir. - Run.

728
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:02,024
我想告诉大家我被陷害 可没人愿意听
I tried to tell everyone I Was being set up' but no one wanted to listen.

729
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,693
现在由不得你们
Well, now you have no choice.

730
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,446
你们必须听 因为我们要待在这里...
You got to listen, because we're not leaving here...

731
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,157
...直到查出陷害我的人
...until I find out who set me up.

732
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,619
我警告你们:
Let me warn you:

733
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,581
杀害内森的凶手担心尼鲍姆知道底细
Whoever killed Nate is frightened that Niebaum might know something.

734
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,667
他们想尽快了结此事
They're going to try and end this quickly.

735
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,711
另一个警告:
Another Warning:

736
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:27,883
我知道交战原则 所以别试探我
I know the rules of engagement, so don't test me.

737
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:32,930
你们还有4分钟让塞比安赶到...
You got four minutes to get Sabian here...

738
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,767
...否则就会知道我不是虚张声势
...or you'll find out just how serious I really am.

739
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,077
看着我的眼睛告诉我 尼鲍姆
I want you to look me in the eye' Niebaum.

740
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,995
看着我
Right here.

741
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,581
告诉我...
now, tell me...

742
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,503
...你何时发现内森在调查基金?
...when did you find out Nate was investigating the fund?

743
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,349
我第一次发现内森在调查是...
I first found that Nathan was conducting the investigation...

744
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,643
...跟你谈过话后 他遇害后
...after I spoke with you after he was killed.

745
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,814
你撒谎 我知道你撒谎
You're lying. And I know you're lying.

746
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,984
你知道? 你能看透我想什么? 罗曼
Oh' you know it, huh? You can read my mind, Roman, is that it?

747
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,862
我不会读心 但我会看你的眼睛
No, I'm not. I'm reading your eyes.

748
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,697
眼睛不会撒谎
The eyes can't lie.

749
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,658
不知道我是干哪行的吗?
Didn't you know what I was doing?

750
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,705
我教你识别谎言的方法 真正的警察...
A quick lesson in lying. See' this is what us real cops do.

751
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,498
研究撒谎的人
We study liars.

752
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,708
例如:
Example:

753
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,503
我若问你视觉类问题 如你最喜欢的颜色...
If I ask you a question about something visual, like your favorite color...

754
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,381
...你的眼睛会向上看左边...
...and your eyes go up and to the left...

755
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,885
...神经生理学家说眼睛转向那方向...
...neurophysiology tells us that your eyes go that in that direction...

756
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,137
...因为你在进入视觉皮层
...because you're accessing the visual cortex.

757
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,598
因此你说的是实话
Therefore, you're telling the truth.

758
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,309
如果眼睛向上看右边...
If your eyes go up and right...

759
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,728
表示你进入大脑想像中心...
...you access the creative centers of the brain...

760
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,771
...我们知道你在胡扯
...and We know you're full of shit.

761
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,065
再试一次
now, let's try this again.

762
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,860
你最喜欢的电视节目?
What's your favorite television show?

763
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,863
我不跟你玩这种愚蠢的游戏 罗曼
I'm not gonna play your stupid fucking game, okay, Roman?

764
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,824
为什么? 害怕我们揭穿你撒谎?
Oh' why, Niebaum? You afraid We'll catch you in a lie?

765
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,372
你什么时候发现内森调查基金?
When did you find out Nate Was investigating the fund?

766
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,668
- 和你谈过以后  - 他在撒谎 鬼也看得出!
- Ahem. After I spoke with you. - That is a fucking lie if I've ever seen one!

767
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,881
- 去你的 我根本没眨眼睛 - 不用眨眼睛
- Fuck you! I never blinked my eyes! - You didn't have to blink.

768
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,883
你的肢体语言表明你有撒谎
Your body language says you're lying.

769
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,427
他紧张 你还想要他怎样?
He's nervous, Danny. What do you expect?

770
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,013
闭嘴 你知道这很灵!
Shut up' Frost! You know how this works!

771
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,682
不只眼睛 还有别的
It's not just your eyes, Niebaum. It's everything.

772
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,228
咳嗽 打喷嚏 交叉腿 挠屁股...
If you cough, sneeze, uh, cross your legs, scratch your ass...

773
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,563
...都是提示 你骗不了人
...they're all telltale signs. You can't cheat.

774
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,983
你可以用那死鱼眼瞪我
You can stare at me with those dead-ass eyes of yours all you want.

775
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,110
可你违背不了规律
You can't beat the system.

776
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,445
最后一个问题:
One last question:

777
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,117
是谁杀了内森?
Do you know who killed Nate?

778
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,252
是你
You.

779
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,091
我看不出来 上 下 左 右...
I don't know. I couldn't tell. Up, down, right, left...

780
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,219
下面是什么? 扑克戏法?
So, What now? Card tricks?

781
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,471
闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up, Niebaum!

782
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,724
你知道内森在调查基金就杀了他
You knew Nate Was investigating the fund and you killed him.

783
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,354
你能结束这一切 可你大概不愿意
You could've ended this, but I guess you don't Want to.

784
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,981
这太糟了
That's too bad.

785
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,152
真的很糟糕 鲁迪...
That's really too bad, Rudy...

786
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,739
...因为丹尼・罗曼开始喜欢你了
...because Danny Roman was just starting to like you.

787
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,117
叫丹尼・罗曼等一下
Well' tell Danny Roman to hold the fuck on.

788
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,953
丹尼
Danny.

789
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,497
- 丹尼 你不想这么做  - 你怎么知道?
- Danny, you don't wanna do this. - how do you know?

790
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,168
你真认为我能杀内森 怎么知道我不想这么做?
If you think I could kill Nate, how the fuck do you know I don't wanna do this?

791
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,473
- 谁? - 丹尼・罗曼?
- Yeah? - Danny Roman?

792
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,350
我是克瑞斯・塞比安
This is Chris Sabian here.

793
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,187
来得正好 你来得很及时
Ah, good timing, Chris. You made it just in time.

794
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,692
- 我运气不错 没堵车  - 很高兴你接受我的邀请
- Well, I got lucky. Traffic was light. - Glad you accepted my invitation.

795
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,446
说什么我也不能错过 有两年没见了?
I wouldn't have missed it for the world. What's it been' Danny? Two years?

796
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,866
自从那次两个组在北区碰上后
Not since both our teams showed up for that gig on the north side.

797
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,201
你的级别高把我们赶走了
You pulled rank and ran my boys out of there.

798
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,997
两个谈判专家在一起没法干
Two negotiators on the same site never work.

799
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,792
那这算什么? 更正谬论的一个例外?
So, What's this, then? The, uh, exception that disproves the rule?

800
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,921
你干好你的活 我干好我的...
Look, you do your job' I do mine...

801
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,007
...也许我们都能活着出去
...maybe we both walk out in one piece.

802
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,473
- 问你一个关键问题  - 为什么要找你?
- Here's the million-dollar question. - Why you?

803
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,266
没错
Exactly.

804
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,894
我有我的原因 现在不想说
I got my reasons. I don't wanna go into them now.

805
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,188
以后会告诉你
We'll talk about that later.

806
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,232
这是初次约会 我不想失礼
This is our first date, Chris. The courting period.

807
01:00:55,735 --> 01:01:01,156
劝说我这种人无效时 你会干些什么?
So, What do guys like you do when you're not talking guys like me down?

808
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:07,371
我是个很顾家的人 通常会和家人待在一起
Well' I, uh... I'm a homebody, Danny. I spend a lot of time with my family.

809
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,873
我的孩子
My' um, kid.

810
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,751
我看很多书
I, uh, read a lot of books.

811
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,921
还看了很多老电影 电影频道
I, um, watch a lot of old movies. AMC.

812
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,882
你有卫星天线吗? 他们播放很多西部片
You got a satellite? They show all those old, uh, Westerns.

813
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,093
西部片?
Westerns? Heh.

814
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,594
我喜欢看喜剧片
I like comedies, myself.

815
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,389
不过我喜欢"原野奇侠" 那是部好电影
I did like Shane though. That's a good one.

816
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,724
"原野奇侠" 那是部好电影...
Uh, Shane. now, that's a good one...

817
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,895
...可我更喜欢英雄活到最后的电影
...but, uh, I'd have picked one where the hero lives at the end' you know?

818
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,899
例如"好汉利奥"或"红河"
Like, uh, Rio Bravo or Red River.

819
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,276
你记错了
You're talking about the wrong movie.

820
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,656
西恩没死 最后他骑马离去 那个孩子 布兰顿...
Shane lives. At the end of it, he's riding oft and that kid, uh, Brandon...

821
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,865
德怀尔
De Wilde.

822
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,452
对 布兰顿・德怀尔喊: "西恩 回来 西恩"
Brandon's De Wilde's calling his name: "Shane, come back! Shane!"

823
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,540
对不起 我得告诉你西恩死了
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Shane died.

824
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,167
你没看见西恩死 那是个假设
You never see Shane dead. That's an assumption.

825
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,128
这是个普遍错误
It's a common mistake.

826
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,297
最后一个镜头 能看见他从马上跌落
You see, in the final shot, you see him slumped over his horse.

827
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,134
他没有回头看 因为他做不到 西恩死了
He doesn't look back' because he's can't. Shane's dead.

828
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,137
他落马因为中弹 落马不表示他死了
He's slumped because he's shot. Slumped don't mean dead.

829
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,723
那你也许认为神枪手和智多星也活着...
I guess you think that Butch and Sundance live too...

830
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,934
...你没看见他们死 只看见他们被团团包围
...even though you never see them dead, and they're surrounded.

831
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,811
这么说你是历史专家?
So you're some kind of history buft?

832
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,439
对 我常看历史和传记
Yeah, I generally read histories and biographies.

833
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,482
书上写的不可全信
Well' don't believe everything you read.

834
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,985
我没说我只看了一本书
Well' I didn't say I read just one book.

835
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,822
同一题材的书我尽量都看 弄清全部事实...
I try to read all the books on a subject. You know, try to get all the facts...

836
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,658
...然后自己判断究竟发生了什么
...and then decide for myself what really happened.

837
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,495
弄清全部事实 你很聪明
Mm-hm. Get all the facts. Yeah, that's smart.

838
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,831
你比法利强得多
You're much better at this than Farley.

839
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,126
在大家听烦了之前我们言归正传
Before we start to bore everyone, let's get back to business.

840
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,420
首先是我的要求
First, my list of demands.

841
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,176
一: 把我的警徽还给我
One: I want my badge brought down here.

842
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,678
二: 如果我死了 举行警方葬礼
Two: If I die, I want a departmental funeral.

843
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,263
这里没人会死
No one's gonna die here.

844
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,348
三: 找到那个告密人
Three: I want the informant found.

845
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,267
只有他能还我清白...
He's the one that can clear my name...

846
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,228
...他知道谁是这个阴谋的主使
...and he's the one who knows who's running this conspiracy.

847
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,939
四: 我要知道谁杀了我的搭档
Four: I wanna know who killed my partner.

848
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,902
8小时找不到告密人或凶手...
now, if neither the informant or killer is found in eight hours...

849
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:05,030
...我每小时杀1个人质 直到他们死光
...I Will kill one hostage an hour until they're all dead.

850
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,448
五:
Five:

851

856
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,549

857
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,385
给我防弹衣
All right. Vest.

858
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,680
- 你要上去?  - 是的
- You're going up there? - Yes.

859
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,517
- 为什么不劝他下来?  - 他不会听
- Why didn't you talk him down? - He would have expected it.

860
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,727
他的资料
His sheet, please.

861
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,148
- 谁知道他为什么找我?  - 我们还想问你呢
- Know why he asked for me? - We Were hoping you could answer that.

862
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,400
我不知道 心理评估谁做的?
I can't. Psych evaluation? Who's on it?

863
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,028
- 是唐瑞  - 他认为自己是无辜的
- That's Tonray. - He may actually think he's innocent.

864
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,532
可能不得不动武 我们有个计划
We're probably gonna have to go tactical. We've put a plan together.

865
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,536
若能引开他的注意力 突击小组从这里进去
If we distract him long enough, we can send in an infiltration team.

866
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,996
- 先不忙采取行动 - 他妻子来了
- Let's wait on that. - The Wife's here.

867
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,627
天哪 他怎么样? 谁在跟他谈?
Oh' God. how is he? Has he hurt anyone? Who's talking to him?

868
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,421
凯伦 他没事 他要见克瑞斯・塞比安
Karen, he's okay. He asked for Chris Sabian.

869
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,924
- 克瑞斯・塞比安  - 我是克瑞斯・塞比安
- Chris Sabian. - I'm Chris Sabian.

870
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,468
- 你认识丹尼?  - 不认识
- Do you know Danny? - No.

871
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,222
他们说的那些全是无中生有 你要帮他
Doesn't matter to you, but he didn't do those things. You have to help him.

872
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,016
我不知道丹尼是否有罪 这不是我来的目的
I have no idea about Danny,s guilt or innocence.

873
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,061
我要带他安全地出来 你若想帮忙...
I'm here to get him out safely. So if you wanna help...

874
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,398
...去回答唐瑞几个问题 然后回家
...go with Tonray, ansWer his questions, and we'll drive you home.

875
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,233
不 我不回家
No. No, I'm not going home.

876
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,777
罗曼夫人...
Mrs. Roman...

877
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,865
...你只能增加这里的紧张与不安
...you bring tension and emotion to a scene that already has too much of both.

878
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,784
我绝不离开我丈夫
I am not leaving my husband.

879
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,124
你想帮他就先帮我
All right, fine, but if you wanna help him, help me.

880
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,459
我现在必须上去 他想跟我谈
I have to get up there. He wants to talk to me.

881
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,963
你回答唐瑞的问题 别走开 也许用得着你
Go with Tonray, answer his questions and then stay in case We need you.

882
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,466
- 我只能做到这种程度  - 凯伦 随我过来 谈一谈
- That's the best I can do. - Karen' come with me and talk, okay?

883
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,968
没事的
It's gonna be all right.

884
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,809
我怎么上去?
how do I get up?

885
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,979
乘电梯到18楼然后走楼梯
Take the freight elevator to 18. Walk the rest of the way.

886
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,148
我想掩护都准备好了
I assume you've got all these covered.

887
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,233
这是什么? 通向监察部的风道?
This is a shaft off Internal Affairs?

888
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,611
那是蒸气管 不能用
That's access to the steam pipes. It's unusable.

889
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,989
先把他的警徽拿来 再关掉暖气
All right. First' get his badge down there. Second, shut off the heat.

890
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:14,326
他会拿人质换暖气 几频道?
He might deal a hostage to get it back. What channel we on?

891
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,288
3频道 局长 你来看
Three. Chief, I wanna show you something.

892
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:24,920
- 丹尼 带我去  - 带他去吧
- Danny, take me. - Yeah. Yeah. Take him. Come on.

893
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,464
我有哮喘 知道吗?
I got the asthma. You know?

894
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,844
你不能让我去冒险
You can't put me in bad situations, man.

895
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:37,307
天哪 为什么总是看上我?
For chrissakes. Why you always pick on me?

896
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,101
我是什么人? 查理・布朗?
I mean, Who am I? Charlie Brown?

897
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,354
知道尼采怎么说:
You know what Nietzsche says:

898
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,608
即使最强壮的人 也有疲劳的时候
Even the strongest have their moments of fatigue.

899
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,860
我累了 丹尼
And I'm fatigued, Danny.

900
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,237
我实在太累了
I'm fucking fatigued.

901
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,507
- 你没事吧?  - 我像没事吗?
- You okay? - Do I look okay?

902
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,677
枪在背后指着我的头
I got a gun pointed at the back of my head.

903
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,178
你的裤子不错
Nice fucking pants.

904
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,847
住口 时装大师 过来
Shut up' Mr. Blackwell. Get over here.

905
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,561
- 在上班? - 差不多
- You Working? - Sort of.

906
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,232
在说服我妻子和女儿休战
I was negotiating a truce between my Wife and daughter.

907
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,401
相比之下比这里容易一点
That might prove to be easy by comparison.

908
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,195
不会让我感到惊讶
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

909
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,324
- 你们关掉了暖气  - 你应该知道程序
- So you shut off the heat already. - You know how this works, Danny.

910
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,993
我知道
Yeah, I do.

911
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,205
下次你想骗人先把手机充足电
Next time you try and bluff, make sure you charge your cell phone.

912
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,292
告诉我 让我来干什么?
All right, now' you Wanna tell me what I'm doing up here?

913
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,546
我要当面告诉你我没有疯
I Wanted to tell you face to face I'm not crazy.

914
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,090
这样做只为证明我无辜
I'm just doing this to prove my innocence.

915
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,593
我相信你 我愿意尽力帮你出去...
I believe you. Anything I can do to help you get out...

916
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,887
别对我以恩人自居!
Don't fucking patronize me, man.

917
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,181
你不相信我是无辜的! 别说:
You don't think I'm innocent, so don't tell me:

918
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,809
"我愿意尽力帮你出去"
"I wanna do everything I can to help you get out."

919
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,103
别把我当成二流劫匪
Don't talk to me like I'm some second-rate HT.

920
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,439
你说的对 对不起 我错了
All right, you're right. I'm sorry. My mistake.

921
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:10,692

你说的对 你说的对
You're right. You're right.

924
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,661
我不知道你是否有罪
I don't know if you're innocent or not.

925
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,580
他们对你的指责可能是事实
You could've done everything they say.

926
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:27,000
那警察可能是你杀的 我不知道也管不着
You could have killed that cop. I don't know and I don't care.

927
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,295
有办法能证明你无辜 但这肯定不是
There are ways to prove your innocence. This is hardly one of them.

928
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,881
你扣押了人质...
And now you got hostages...

929
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,799
...我要告诉你:
...so let me tell you this:

930
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,970
你要是伤害他们 我将不再有兴趣跟你谈判
You hurt one of them, you burn up whatever currency you got to deal With me.

931
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,891
我只关心他们 不在乎你能否活着出去
They're all I care about. You leaving here walking is a distant second.

932
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:47,353
- 我说的够清楚吗?  - 很好
- now, do I make myself clear? - Good.

933
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,064
我们有进展了

很好 回答我的问题 为什么叫我上来?
Good, now ansWer my question. What am doing I up here?

935
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,488

Before Nate Was killed, he told me the men involved in the fraud...

936
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,657

- 我称为朋友的人  - 那怎么样?
- Guys I might call friends. - And?

938
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,370
你不是
And you're not.

939
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,664
当朋友出卖你时...
When your friends betray you...

940
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,584
...唯一能信任的是陌生人
...sometimes the only people you can trust are strangers.

941

979
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,770
你是指挥还是他是指挥?
Is this your command or is it his?

980
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,191
你分散了他的注意力 我们找到机会了结此事

那是你的方式 不是我的方式! 应先谈判!
That's what you did, and that's not how I work. First' we talk.

983
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,533
是我的命令
It was my call.

984
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,370
我们觉得此人不可能被说服
We don't feel this man can be talked down.

985
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,373
是吗? 我来了才半个小时 你怎么知道?
Oh' really? I've been here a half-hour! how do you know that?

986
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,627

...I have kept a zero casualty rate for five years...

988
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,508
...因为这种行动是最后手段!
...because this kind of action is a last resort.

989
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,385
这里不归你指挥 塞比安
This is not your command, Sabian.

990
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,056
没错 可是我有责任 那就是救那些人出来
Yeah, that's right. My command is to get those people out safely.

- That's my command! - You don't know this man, lieutenant!

992
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,565
他操纵了整个局势 巴勒莫就受了他的影响
He's manipulating this situation. Look what he did to Palermo.

993
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:04,402
他会将所有人各个击破...
He's gonna fuck With every single fucking one of you...

994
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,196
...如果给他足够时间 他知道你能办到
...if we give him enough time, and he knows you'll do it.

995

- 他熟悉你的工作  - 他说的有道理 塞比安
- He knows how you fucking Work. - He's got a point, Sabian.

996
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,827
我们有我们的指挥系统
We do have a chain of command.

997
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,164
你的指挥系统多给了他两名人质
Your chain of command has just given Danny two more hostages.

998
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,210
他若杀掉其中一个 你负责吗? 反正我不负责!
Officers. You gonna take responsibility if he takes one of them out? Because I don't!

999
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,840

They're just waiting to take this over. You want that to happen?

1000
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,134
你可以做个简单决定

罗曼要我来 我会跟他谈
Roman asked for me and he's gonna get me.

1002
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,848
要么按我的方法 要么我走
We're gonna do it my way or I walk.

1003
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,726
我很乐意马上离开 把责任留给你
I got no truck with leaving you with this responsibility.

1004
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:40,063
现在由你选择 或让他们接管这里的一切
now, it's your decision, or they're gonna fucking take it over.

1005

现在由你指挥

Am I gonna have to hurt somebody to get respect?

1042

好吧 我会的!

Danny, listen to me. Don't do that. Don't take this to the next level.

他有没有对讲机?
Does he have a radio?

1046
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,523
以为你能杀人后逍遥法外
Think you can come in here and just shoot me' huh?

1047
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:33,027
他们派你来杀我? 以为能杀了我就转身跑掉?
They send you to kill me and you just do it? You just think you can get away With it?

1048
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,238
我知道你是他们一伙的
I know you're one of them. I know you are.

1049
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,782
你要为你对我做的事付出代价!

1050
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,786

You are not in control! They are! They're not listening to you' Chris.

我要给他们点颜色看看!
So l'm gonna show them why they should!

1056
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,471
你派来的每一个王八蛋都得送命!
One of the son-of-a-bitches you sent in is about to die!

Are you one of them, Scott? One of the men that set me up?

1062
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,073
所以你想我翘辫子?

切断电源 马上切断
Cut the electric. Cut it now.

1069
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:45,660
几个小时按兵不动之后 刚才市政大楼20层...
After hours of little action, we've witnessed a flurry of activity...

1070
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,579
...发生短暂暴乱
...on the 20th floor of the Chicago administration building.

1071
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,540
看来下面还有更多行动
And it looks like there's a little more action going on now.

Looks like plainclothes... Actually, those are federal sedans...

1074
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:59,340
...载着联邦特工抵达现场
...FBI agents, in fact, arriving on the scene.

1075
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,593
这是本次事件的一个很大进展 因为到目前为止...
This is a major development for this story, because up until now...

1076
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,389
...谈判一直由芝加哥警方单独进行
...this negotiation has been handled by the Chicago police department.

1077
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:10,434
联邦调查局可能是来协助谈判...
With the arrival of the feds, they are either coming to aid in the negotiation...

1078
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:14,522
...也可能是来接管谈判
...or perhaps, more likely, to take over the negotiations.

1079
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,567
不过这只是猜想 只知道他们到达现场 ...
But that is all speculation. All we know is that they are now on the scene...

1080

你杀了一个无辜的人!
You killed an innocent man!

1084

1085

是他们一伙的 他要杀我

I told you all when I came in here I wasn't leaving till I got the truth.

1091
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,122
督察?

他将所有私人资料存在电脑里

1098

Don't think you've bought anything by asking me to come here.

(查找伤残基金)

1171
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,248
这里还设了很多密码
There's a lot of added security here.

1172
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:16,003
还不错 我只落后了6个月
It's not bad. It's just outdated by six months.

1173
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:18,839
该死的警察 总是慢两步
Mm. Fucking cops. Always two steps behind.

1174
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,685
他在寻求人们相信他
He's looking for people to believe in him.

1175
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,689
我没帮上什么忙
I don't think I helped the situation.

1176
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,734
他就杀了斯科特
Then he shoots Scott.

1177
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,535
天哪 我无能为力
Christ. I couldn't do anything.

1178
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,707
弗罗斯

...about Danny,s relationship to the fund, his case and specifically, this informant.

- 点击"监听"  - 好的
- Click on wires. - Okay.

1187
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,487
被偷听的人真多
Oh' man, there's a lot of wires.

1188
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,657
- 这些号码是什么? - 警徽编号
- What are these numbers? - Cops' badge numbers.

1189
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,159
往下走
Okay, now scroll down.

1190
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,664
停 往上走一个
Stop, stop' stop. Back up one.

1191
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,501
这是内森的警徽
That's Nate's badge. Okay.

01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,672
点击
Click that.

1193
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,683
他们查过帐...
Well, they did do an audit...

1194
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,643
...可什么也没发现
...but they didn't prove anything.

1195
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,144
嘿 那是我的声...
Hey, that's my voice...

1196
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,106
若有人偷我们的钱 我们必须找出是谁
Somebody's taking our money. We gotta find out who it is.

1197
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:01,858
见鬼!
Oh, shit!

1198
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,988
你这混蛋
You son of a bitch.

1199
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,365
给内森安了窃听器
You were tapping Nate.

1200
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,451
你早知道他在调查基金
You knew he was investigating the fraud.

1201
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,371
- 你撒谎! - 见你的鬼!
- You lied. - Fuck you!

1202
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,207
你杀了他 因为他就要查出真相
And then you killed him because he was getting too close.

1203
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,502
我们监听很多警员 可这屋里只有一个凶手
Tap a lot of cops. There's only one killer in this room.

1204
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,213
我不是凶手 你才是凶手
I'm not the killer here, you are.

1205
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:27,801
返回到10月12日 内森被害的前一晚
Scroll back to October 12th, the night before Nate was killed.

1206
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,014
- 只有一个录音 - 打开!

All right, all right.

1208
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,852
告诉我出了什么事?
Are you gonna talk to me?

1209
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,605
我正在查一个案子...
It's that case I'm working on. It's, uh...

1210
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,321
我去去就来 对不起 我很快回来
Look, l'II just be a minute. Sorry, honey. I won't be long.

1211
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,449
我只想看看他在不在
I just wanna see if he's here, you know?

1212
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:53,744
我不能在电话上跟他谈...
I don't wanna talk to him on the phone. It's just not...

1213
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,707
我马上就过来 你等我一会
I'll see you soon, okay? I'll just be a minute.

1214
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,919
- 好吗  - 好的?
- Okay. - Okay?

1215
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:05,922
- 我爱你  - 我也爱你
- I love you. - Mm-hm. I love you too.

1216
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,551
他是去见那个告密人?
He was going to see his informant, wasn't he?

1217
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,262
你不知道自己在说什么
Ha-ha-ha. You don't know what you're talking about.

1218
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,600
内森遇害前一天晚上对我说 他刚见过告密人
The night before Nate was killed he told me he had just talked to his informant.

1219
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,268
是的
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,937
这你也知道
You knew that too.

1221
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,401
出了什么事 尼鲍姆?
What's going on here, Niebaum?

1222
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:29,279
你为什么找不到这个人?
Why can't you find this guy, huh?

1223
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:33,450
你一定找过他 想把他杀掉!
You gotta be looking for him so you can shut him up too!

1224
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,664
你不知道他是谁 对吗?
You don't know who he is, do you?

1225
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,335
琳达不告诉你那晚他们去了哪里
Linda wouldn't tell you where they went that night, would she?

1226
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:46,713
她认为你和我同样有罪!
Because she thinks you're as guilty as I am.

1227
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,106
- 说吧 丹尼  - 这是私人线路吗?
- Go ahead. - Is this a private line?

1228
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:06,441
- 你想单独谈?  - 是的
- You need it to be? - Yeah.

1229
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,320
抱歉
Sorry.

1230
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:11,988
说吧
Go ahead.

1231
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,826
我要你找内森的妻子琳达谈谈
I need you to talk to Linda Roenick, Nate's wife.

1232
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,327
谈什么?
About what?

1233
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:22,290
我找到录音证明 尼鲍姆一直在撒谎
I found some taps that prove Niebaum's been lying all along.

1234
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,627
我听到些情况需要你问琳达
I heard something on one of them. I need you to ask Linda about it.

1235
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,337
你一个人去
You and only you.

1236
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:30,090
要我问她什么?
What do you want me to ask her?

1237
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:34,010
10月12日晚 内森死的前一天
Ask her where she and Nate went on October 12th, the night before he died.

1238
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,470
她们去找谁?
Who he talked to.

1239
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:40,475
她说出内森见了谁 我再给你一个人质
If she tells you who he saw, I'll give you another hostage.

1240
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:43,603
她什么都不说 你什么也没有
If she tells you nothing, you get nothing.

1241
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,398
准备好人质
Have my hostage ready.

1242
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,994
太好了
Great. All right.

1243
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,871
- 请原谅  - 我得走了
- Excuse me. - I gotta go.

1244
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,747
- 能谈谈吗?  - 谈吧
- Can we have a word? - Yes.

1245
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:06,877
赫尔曼研究了大楼设计图 他们有个建议
Hellman's been studying the blueprints with Beck. They have a suggestion.

1246
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:08,378
你肯听建议?
You do take suggestions?

1247
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,759
他认为可派人从通风管靠近罗曼
Hellman thinks we can get a team in the vent system right above Roman.

1248
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:19,514
我们建议派人进去 以应付紧急情况 就一个小组
What we're suggesting is getting men in place for a crisis entry. Just one unit.

1249
01:31:19,682 --> 01:31:20,807
以防万一
Only as a precaution.

1250
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,519
这样能将他制服 如果他杀害人质
With this type of entry, we can control him in case he starts shooting hostages.

1251
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:29,566
扔颗闪光弹 二三秒就能控制局面
We can go in there strong, two, three seconds from bang to bullets.

1252
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,818
我们不是要全面进攻
Sabian, we're not asking for a full breach.

1253
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,237
只是担心他杀害另一个兄弟
We have a real concern he may kill one of our men.

1254
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:38,200
你可能无所谓 可对我们很重要
That may not mean much to you, but it means a hell of a lot to us.

1255
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:39,618
贝克 别这样
Beck, please.

1256
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,287
克瑞斯 我们想有备无患
Chris, I just wanna be ready to go if we need to.

1257
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:46,333
我同意指挥官的看法 也担心我的队员受伤
I agree with the commander's assessment, and I do care if our team is injured...

1258
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,252
...可无论丹尼做什么 不经我批准...
...but they don't move an inch, no mater What Danny does...

1259
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,046
...他们不得前进1英寸
...without my authorization.

1260
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:54,341
- 先生们?  - 没问题
- Gentlemen? - Without a doubt.

1261
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,763
赛比安
Sabian.

1262
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:26,164
我们制造机会 你趁机干掉他
Allen' we're gonna make an opportunity. We'll take him out if we get the shot.

1263
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,041
明白
Right.

1264
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,049
这里怎么样?
how you holding up?

1265
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,134
很好
Good.

1266
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,303
你下去休息一会
Why don't you take a little break?

1267
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:46,476
我带你们进去 该结束了
I'm gonna get us inside. We're gonna end this thing.

1268
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,062
动手吧
Let's do it.

1269
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,236
- 有人要去洗手间吗?  - 我要去
- Anybody gotta use the bathroom? - Yes, I do.

1270
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,029
还有我
Me too.

1271
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,369
厕所在哪里 麦琪?
Where is it, Maggie?

1272
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,080
街对面意大利小饭馆里有一个...
There's one across the street in a nice restaurant...

1273
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,666
...但可能去不成
...but I'm sure that's probably out of the question.

1274
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,128
你可以去 只要能忍到我们出去
You can use that one if you can hold it till we get out of here.

1275
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,298
走廊那头有一个
There's one down the hall.

1276
01:33:18,634 --> 01:33:19,843
谢谢
Thank you.

1277
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,017
她走后你用这个
When she's gone, use this.

1278
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,360
我们要控制大厦 占领19层...
You bet' we need to contain the building. I need teams on 19...

1279
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:39,112
...20层 21层
...20 and 21.

1280
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,156
- 是 长官 - 封锁大厅
- Yes, sir. - And secure the lobby.

1281
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,033
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1282
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,081
- 塞比安在外面干什么? - 不知道
- What the hell is Sabian doing up there? - No idea.

1283
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:53,793
1小时前来了个男人 他们一直在谈
Guy came in about an hour ago. They've been talking ever since.

1284
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,688
这么久还没有答复?
Why the hell is this taking so long?

1285
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:17,651
他们想拖垮丹尼 让他疲惫不堪
They're trying to wear down Danny so he gets tired.

1286
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:23,073
你为何列出这些警察和他们的银行帐户 尼鲍姆?
Why the hell do you have all these cops and their accounts in here, Niebaum?

1287
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:27,702
为何调查你也参与的诈骗案?
Why are you investigating a fraud that you're part of?

1288
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,080
我没有参与诈骗
I'm not part of any fraud.

1289
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:36,419
是不是发现了他们揩基金的油 你就勒索他们?
Did you out find these cops Were skimming from the fund and you blackmailed them?

1290
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,713
你负责这部份?
Is that how it works?

1291
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,592
为何挑他们? 这些人拿不到大钱
Why these cops? These guys don't have access to the money.

1292
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,720
这主要是保险欺诈 对吗?
Well' it's basically insurance fraud, right?

1293
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,765
- 什么?  - 是...
- What? - It's...

1294
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,600
有些人...
Somebody...

1295
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:54,771
名单上的人申请虚假赔偿
Some of these guys on this list submit false claims.

1296
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:59,609
和我做过的汽车保险一样... 我认识的一个人...
It's like this auto-body thing I pulled... I mean, some guy I know...

1297
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:04,823
他对保险公司说他的车撞毁了 对吗?
He would tell the insurance company his car had been wrecked, right?

1298
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:07,492
- 很简单  - 然后呢?
- It's very simple. - And then?

1299
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,705
若没保险经纪人的份 他休想拿到赔偿
Well' he'd never get paid if the claims agent Wasn't in on it.

1300
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,792
需要有人处理文件 并为你掩盖?
So you need somebody with access to put the paperWork through, then cover it up.

1301
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,293

All right, what is this, Sabian? Who is this?

1305
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,562

凯尔・温格罗警长
Sergeant Cale Wangro.

1310
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,178
他知道哪些人参与
He knows who's involved.

1311
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,014
内森死后他不敢出面...
He was afraid to come forward after Nathan was killed...

1312
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,516
...他不能肯定你和他们是不是一伙
...and he Wasn't sure whether you were involved.

1313
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:14,726
都有谁?

Listen' Danny. This is gonna implicate too many people.

1315
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:23,026
联邦调查局的人在这里 他们将为他录口供以确保公平
So the FBI is here. They're ready to take his statement to ensure impartiality.

1316
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:26,946
不能在电话上透露 问题解决了
But I cannot have this go over the air, all right, so it's over, Danny.

1317
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,365

克瑞斯 让告密人接电话
Chris, put Nate's informant on.

1327
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,572
丹尼 我不想广播出去
Danny, I don't want this broadcast.

1328
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,659
他若能还我清白 我想跟他谈谈
Look, if he can clear my name, I wanna talk to him' now.

1329
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:25,547

凯尔 你很勇敢能站出来
Hi, Cale. Very brave of you to come down like this.

1331
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,427
我有很多问题
You know I have a lot of questions.

1332
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,265
首先 都有谁参与了...
Let's just start with, uh, who was involved...

1333
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:37,600
...这阴谋? 凯尔
...in this conspiracy, for 500, Cale.

1334
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:41,354
我不能当众点出他们的名字
I can't name names, not in front of everyone here.

1335
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,899
- 这样做不恰当  - 别跟我说什么恰当
- Wouldn't be, uh, appropriate. - I don't wanna hear about appropriate.

1336
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,861
告诉我哪些人参与了 都有谁?
Just tell me who Was involved. now, who was it?

别逼我指名道姓
Don't make me say their names.

1341
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,490
(当警察多少年了? )

1342
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:09,883
你为什么不找尼鲍姆?
Why didn't you go see Niebaum?

1343
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:14,304
我不知道尼鲍姆是否被收买保持沉默
I didn't know if Niebaum was getting paid off to be quiet or not.

1344
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:17,891
我不相信他或监察部
I couldn't trust him or Internal Affairs.

1345
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:22,645
- 有人提过他的名字  - 所以尼鲍姆肯定参与了
- I did hear his name mentioned. - So Niebaum was definitely involved.

1359
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,964
对不起...
Sorry' um...

1360
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:36,135
内森跟我说 你们在科罗拉多大学打过棒球 是吗?
So Nate tells me, uh, you played ball with him at Colorado State, that right?

1361
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:39,222
对 可这与此事有何关系?
Yeah, but what's this have to do with anything?

1362
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,891
他上的是亚利桑那大学

1363
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,522
叫克瑞斯接电话

1364
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,494
赛比安 你勇气可佳 但你的把戏不管用
Nice try, Sabian. Your little bluff didn't work.

1365
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:09,419
尼鲍姆说内森是他的告密人 他为监察部工作
Niebaum told me Nate was his informant. See' he worked for IAD.

1366
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:12,213
一直替尼鲍姆工作 他说的知情人是他自己
Worked for Niebaum all along. He was describing himself.

1367
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:13,673
只是不想让我知道
Just didn't Want me to know.

1368
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:17,260
尼鲍姆说他没参与谋杀
now, Niebaum says he was not part of the murder.

1369
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,095
怎么回事 赛比安?
What's going on here, Sabian?

1370
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,515
- 他用我们的方法对付尼鲍姆  - 不过他答应出庭作证
- He's using our bluft against Niebaum. - He's willing to testify.

1371
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:26,394
如果你们同意免诉他谋杀罪 他会说出名字
He'll name names if you grant him immunity on the murder charge.

丹尼...
Danny, talk...

1374
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,195
被他看破了
We've been made.

1375
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:40,283
你干什么? 我没说我没同意?
What are you doing? I didn't make a deal. What the fuck are you doing?

1376
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,118
可他们以为你说了 尼鲍姆
They think you did, Niebaum.

1377
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:46,581
你不是说没有阴谋吗? 所以不用担心
But there is no "they," right? So you don't shit have to worry about.

1378
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,545
那是你的计谋?
This was a bluft?

1379
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:56,924
- 要看你处在哪个位置?  - 你知道这事? 弗罗斯
- That all depends on your position. - Did you know about this, Frost?

1380
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:59,552
不 我不知道
No. No, I didn't.

1381
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,638
我告诉他 我知道内森有个告密人
I told him What I knew about Nathan's informant.

1382
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:05,558
你就这样利用我的信息?
This is how you use that information?

1383
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:08,478
让我们相信他是无辜的...
Making us think he's innocent after all those...

1384
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,438
你以为你是谁?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1385
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:13,566
我可以任意使用信息以结束这个局面
I can use information any way I want to try to end this.

1386
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:16,652
我不知道谁是无辜的 我正在设法查清楚
I don't know who's innocent. That's what I'm trying to find out.

1387
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,656
别再叫我来参加你们的猜谜游戏
Don't call me in here to be part of your charades again.

1388
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:23,326

尼鲍姆 他们能杀内森 难道不会杀你?
They killed Nate, Niebaum. Think they won't kill you?

1398

1454
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,895
坚持住 督察 坚持住

快派人上来! 尼鲍姆受...
Get somebody up here! Niebaum's been...

1464
01:47:12,175 --> 01:47:13,634

听见了吗 克瑞斯? 他们杀了他
You hear that, Chris? They killed him.

1467
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:31,485
天啊
Holy Jesus.

1468
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,032
丹尼 你伤了吗?
Danny, are you shot?

1469
01:47:44,749 --> 01:47:47,001
丹尼 上面还有人受伤吗?

1470
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:50,045
还有人受伤吗?
Anyone else hurt up there?

1471
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:56,510
怎么回事? 我刚离开就死人?
What the hell happened? I step out of this room and someone gets killed?

1472
01:47:56,678 --> 01:47:59,096
那是意外 你让我的人怎么办?
It was an accident. What did you expect my men to do?

1473
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:01,223
擅自开枪 是谁先开的枪?
A gun went off. Any idea Who shot first?

1474
01:48:01,391 --> 01:48:05,394
我们有什么可指责的? 我的人是应付突发事件!
What the fuck are you accusing us of? My men responded to a situation!

1475
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,938
爆竹响 你们也采取同样行动?
If a firecracker goes off, you respond the same way?

1476
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:10,399
我们又不了解情况 我们是怎么说的?
We don't know what happened. What did we agree to?

1477
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:13,861
无论丹尼做什么 没有我的命令谁也不能进去
That no matter what, no one goes in without my authority.

1478
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,738
我们说好的!
That's what we agreed on.

1479
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:19,158
你们看不见 也听不见上面的情况 你们只是推测!
You got no eyes, you got no ears, you got nothing but assumptions!

1480
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,703
是我下令进攻 我行使我的权力
I called for the breach. It Was conducted with my authority.

1481
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,996
到此为止
Not anymore.

1482
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:29,752
我们正式接管 联邦调查局不能不管了
We're taking over. FBI cannot stand by and let this situation continue.

1483
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,422
- 别让我走 听我说  - 我们请你离开 中尉
- Don't take me off. Listen to me. - We're asking you to leave, lieutenant.

1484
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,217
我刚才骗了他 可他知道我的目的
All right, I bluffed him' but he knows what I was doing.

1485
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:37,676
请你的人撤出 由突击队顶替...
We need to rotate your men...

1486
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:40,554
他认为刚才有人要杀他!
He thinks someone just tried to kill him!

1487
01:48:40,722 --> 01:48:42,223
我们进入 全面攻击
We're going in. Full breach.

1488
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,226
别这样 听我说 全面攻击的话 所有人都会死
Don't do it. Listen. You breach, everyone's gonna die.

1489
01:48:45,393 --> 01:48:47,269
明白吗? 所有人都会死
Understand that? Everyone's gonna die.

1490
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:50,397
也许你们有人希望这样 可我不希望!
Maybe that's what some of you wanna have happen, but I don't!

1491
01:48:50,565 --> 01:48:54,068
我被叫来救这个人 带他出来!
I was brought here to save this man's life and bring him out' all right?

1492
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:56,445
没理由要伤害人质
There's no reason to jeopardize hostages.

1493
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:57,947
你闭嘴!
Shut up!

1494
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:03,744
特工 换掉我的人是错的 要换谈判专家 很好
Agent Moran, this is a mistake. You wanna change negotiators' fine.

1495
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,580
给罗曼30秒机会...
But you give Roman a 30-second window of opportunity...

1496
01:49:06,748 --> 01:49:08,207
...他都会利用
...he'll exploit it.

1497
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:12,253
必须继续包围 我的人已就位 他们能处理
We gotta keep him locked down. My men can handle it.

1498
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,838
领教过他们的处理方法
We've seen what your men can handle.

1499
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,048
让我留下
Please.

1500
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:18,717
你的人留在原地 我们的人支援...
Your men stay in place. Our men will support yours...

1501
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:22,137
- ...不过你要执行我们的命令  - 赛比安 你走吧
- ...but you'll execute orders that we give. - You're off' Sabian.

1502
01:49:23,139 --> 01:49:26,976
真不敢相信 满屋子人都想进去杀了他
I can't believe this. I'm just surrounded by people who wanna go in and kill him.

1503
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:31,397
这人你们称他为朋友 这与我毫无关系!
This is the guy you called your friend. I got nothing invested in this!

1504
01:49:32,607 --> 01:49:34,650
我想知道为什么!
I wonder why that is!

1505
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:38,320
也许有一天会知道
Maybe someday we'll find out.

1506
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:40,406
谈判结束了
No more negotiating.

1507
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:43,951
送塞比安先生上车
Would you please escort Mr. Sabian to his car?

1508
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:45,953
中尉
Lieutenant.

1509
01:49:46,663 --> 01:49:47,955
这边请
This way' sir.

1510
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:50,874
急不可待要冲上去 你们自称是他的朋友
Dying to go up. You call yourselves his friends.

1511
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:54,169
丹尼・罗曼 我是联邦调查局特工格瑞
Danny Roman' this is Agent Grey of the FBI.

1512
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,673
克瑞斯・塞比安已被解除指挥权 现在由我负责
Chris Sabian has been relieved of his command and I'm in charge.

1513
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:02,553
从现在起停止谈判
As of this mornent, all negotiations are suspended.

1514
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:05,014
给你5分钟投降...
You have five minutes to surrender...

1515
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:07,016
...否则我们进去逮捕你
...or we're coming in after you.

1516
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:21,822
天哪 塞比安进去了
Oh' Christ. Sabian's going in.

1517
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:25,826
丹尼 是我 我就上来
Danny, it's me. I'm on my way up.

1518
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:32,958
丹尼 这不是你的错 我们都听见他承认了 有罪的是他不是你
Danny, this wasn't your fault. We all heard him confess. He Was guilty.

1519
01:50:33,918 --> 01:50:35,169
我知道
Yeah.

1520
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:38,172
无所谓了
Well' what's it matter, Maggie?

1521
01:50:39,007 --> 01:50:41,550
内森死了 尼鲍姆死了
Nate's dead. Niebaum's dead.

1522
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:43,510
电脑也完了
Computer's dead.

1523
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:48,432
塞比安上来了
And, look, Sabian is coming upstairs now.

1524
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,684
必须把尼鲍姆的话告诉他
You have to tell him what Niebaum said.

1525
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:55,397
你要放弃? 那才是犯罪
What, you gonna give up now? Come on, that'd be a crime, man.

1526
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:04,198
你们都听着...
Listen' all of you...

1527
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:07,743
...对不起 把你们牵扯进来
...l'm sorry I got you into this.

1528
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:10,537
很快就要结束了
This'll all be over soon.

1529
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:15,668
丹尼 接电话 否则我们马上强行进入
Danny, pick up the phone or we will be forced to come in.

1530
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:20,673
麦琪 请你转告我妻子
Maggie, would you tell my Wife something for me?

1531
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,593
告诉她 我想信守诺言 我努力了
Just tell her I was trying to keep my promise.

1532
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:34,269
嘿 丹尼
Hey, Danny.

1533
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:38,190
尼鲍姆经常在家里工作
You know, Niebaum Worked at home just about as much as he worked here.

1534
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,778
内森的录音可能保存在家里
He could've kept Nathan's taps there.

1535
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,959
就你自己?
You alone?

1536
01:51:58,628 --> 01:52:01,797
你必须投降 我无法阻止他们 他们就到了
You gotta surrender now. I can't hold them back. They're coming up.

1537
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:05,217
我只差一步 我知道发生了什么
I'm getting too close' Chris. I know What went down now.

1538
01:52:05,468 --> 01:52:08,303
尼鲍姆说: 赫尔曼 埃伦和阿尔金托都参与了
Niebaum told me Hellman, Allen and Argento are involved.

1539
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:11,473
- 你没有证据  - 他有 尼鲍姆的交待我们都听见了
- You got no proof. - He does. Niebaum confessed. We all heard.

1540
01:52:11,641 --> 01:52:15,269
他们想把我们全杀掉 可你一点没帮我们
They're shooting us one by one and you fuckers aren't helping us.

1541
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:19,481
- 你到底想不想帮我们?  - 谁下令进攻 贝克?
- Are you gonna help us or what? - Who called for the breach? Beck?

1542
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,484
他说你先开枪 他的人还击 尼鲍姆是个意外
Yeah, but he says you fired first and Niebaum was an accident.

1543
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:24,737
尼鲍姆不是死于意外 是死于谋杀!
Niebaum Was no accident. He was assassinated.

1544
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:28,073
子弹全打在他胸口
He's got three bullets, center mass. Look.

1545
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:43,255
克瑞斯 你不能否认有阴谋
Come on, Chris. You gotta admit something's going on.

1546
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:46,341
那不重要了 死了两名警官 你杀了其中一个
It doesn't matter. Two cops are dead and you killed one.

1547
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:50,512
我要赶在他们之前送你和人质出去
I need to get you and these hostages out of here before they come in.

1548
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,521
结束了 丹尼!
Let's end this, Danny!

1549
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,081
他们必须相信我能做到
They had to believe I Was capable of that.

1550
01:53:18,374 --> 01:53:22,127
只死了一个警察 是被陷害我的人打死的
There's only one dead cop up here, killed by the men who tried to set me up.

1551
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:26,006
内森录下赫尔曼等人的谈话
now, I know Nate tapped Hellman and the others.

1552
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:29,551
录音带可能在尼鲍姆家里 我能到那里就能结束此事
I think those taps are at Niebaum's. If I get there' I can end this.

1553
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:33,222
他们会杀了你 除了投降 你无法活着出去
They're gonna kill you. Understand? You got no way out unless you surrender.

1554
01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:35,641
你关掉暖气已给了我出路
You gave me a way out when you shut the heat off.

1555
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,727
你知道你有其他办法能帮我
now, you know there's another way you can help me.

1556
01:53:39,103 --> 01:53:40,687
你看错我了
You were wrong about me.

1557
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:44,483
我若没看错他们?
What if I'm right about them?

1558
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:49,363
