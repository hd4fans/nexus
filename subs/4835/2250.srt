1
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,075
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:11,942
Time to wake up.

3
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:13,304
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,609
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,273
That's what
Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,322
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:28,952
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,459
All right.

9
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,656
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!

10
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,131
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,690
Your breakfast
is getting cold.

12
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,099
It's cereal.

13
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,602
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,086
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:03,854
Okay.

16
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,036
Here's your books.

17
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,372
Go ahead.

18
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,190
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a
moment, I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,085
Yes,
she's coming right now.

20
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,720
Just a second,
she'll be with you.

21
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:15,699
Just one second, please. You deal
with this one. I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:19,671
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,938
I can see you're
on a party line...

24
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,110
Unfortunately, some people do
listen in on party lines. We...

25
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,806
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,107
Oh, my...

27
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,516
Everything all right?

28
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:39,149
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was
having trouble with the connection.

29
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,949
Hey, sport.
Hey, Mom.

30
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,425
How was school?

31
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,723
Okay.
Yeah?

32
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,764
We learned
about dinosaurs.

33
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,129
And I got in a fight
with Billy Mankowski.

34
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,258
What happened?

35
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,461
He hit me.

36
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,060
Did you hit him back?

37
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,435
Good.

38
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,768
Rule number one,
remember?

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,536
Never start a fight,
always finish it.

40
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,768
Why'd he hit you?

41
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,142
Because I hit him.

42
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,505
You hit him first?

43
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,040
Why?

44
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,686
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

45
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:12,121
Honey, your father
never met you,

46
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,125
so how could he
not like you?

47
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,990
Then why did he leave?

48
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:21,021
Well, because the day
you were born,

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,500
something else
arrived in the mail.

50
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,495
And it was in a box a
little bit bigger than you.

51
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,198
You know what was in it?

52
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,036
Something called
responsibility.

53
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,099
And to some people,

54
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,941
responsibility is the
scariest thing in the world.

55
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:39,378
So, he ran away because he was
scared of what was in that box?

56
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:40,476
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:41,884
That's just dumb.

58
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,717
That is exactly
what I thought.

59
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,867
<i>Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?</i>

60
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,837
I'm afraid so, sport.

61
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,771
Come now, time for bed.

62
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,510
Are we still going
to the movies tomorrow?

63
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,847
Uh-huh. I hear there's a
new Charlie Chaplin picture

64
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:15,716
<i>and a new serial called
The Mysterious Airman.</i>

65
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,182
Who's that?

66
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,224
I don't know.
Nobody does.

67
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,452
That's what makes him
so mysterious.

68
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,516
Oh.

69
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,022
Am I too heavy
for you to carry?

70
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,759
Oh, no,
not for years.

71
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,323
Not for years.

72
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,368
<i>Hello?
This is Margaret.</i>

73
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,605
Hi, Margaret.

74
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,668
<i>So, how are you?</i>

75
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,975
Fine.

76
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,312
<i>Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.</i>

77
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:46,612
When did she call in sick?

78
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:47,743
<i>About half hour ago.</i>

79
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,481
<i>I'm having a hard time
trying to find someone.</i>

80
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:51,284
Well, what about Myrna?

81
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:52,722
I know she could use
the extra hours and...

82
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,884
<i>She's busy.
Can't you come?</i>

83
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,722
No. No, no, no.
I just...

84
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:03,431
I promised Walter that I'd take
him to the movies, is all, and...

85
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,901
<i>Well, it's just until 4:00.</i>

86
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,164
All right.

87
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,035
Just...
Just until 4:00.

88
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,105
I'll see you then.

89
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,273
There's a sandwich
and milk in the fridge,

90
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,874
and I've asked Mrs. Riley
and her daughter

91
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,715
to stop in
in a couple of hours.

92
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,948
I can take care of myself.

93
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,651
I know you can. They're
checking on the house, not you.

94
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,630
Tomorrow we will
go to the movies.

95
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:42,674
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa
Monica and take a walk on the pier.

96
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,971
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

97
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,344
I'll be home
before it gets dark.

98
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm not afraid
of the dark.

99
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,181
I'm not afraid
of anything.

100
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,818
I know.
I know.

101
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,950
Be good.

102
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:03,685
I love you.

103
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,499
We've got lines jammed
from here to Ohio.

104
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,001
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.

105
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:47,731
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

106
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,831
Number, please.
Number, please.

107
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,176
Go ahead, please.

108
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,243
All right, get me
the Omaha routing station.

109
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,715
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

110
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,376
Let's get this
console running, now.

111
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,023
Christine. Good, I was
hoping to catch you.

112
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,486
Look, I've been following
your work reports,

113
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,757
and I just want to let you
know that I am very impressed.

114
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,265
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,

115
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,892
my superiors weren't
big on the idea.

116
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,836
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.

117
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:20,929
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

118
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,530
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...

119
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,700
Listen, the point is,

120
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,574
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

121
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,671
And if you're interested in the
job, I could write a report, or...

122
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,545
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

123
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,881
Okay, good,
so maybe we could...

124
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,419
Could we speak about it
Monday? Yeah, absolutely.

125
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,978
Would that be all right? Thank
you so much, sir. Thank you.

126
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:47,360
Please!

127
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,264
Please.

128
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,366
Walter.

129
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,465
Honey?

130
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,807
Walter.

131
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,371
Walter!

132
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,742
Honey?

133
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,323
Walter?

134
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,964
Honey!

135
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,405
Walter!

136
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:07,037
Walter, it's time
to come in, honey.

137
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:12,807
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?

138
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:15,778
No, Mrs. Collins.

139
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,048
Sorry.

140
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:27,857
Walter?

141
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,601
Walter.

142
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:57,990
<i>Number, please.</i>

143
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,088
May I please have
the police station?

144
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,689
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

145
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,756
<i>Lincoln Heights
Division.</i>

146
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,632
Hello, my name is
Christine Collins.

147
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,228
I live at 210
North Avenue, 23.

148
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,207
And I'm calling
to report a missing child.

149
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,742
Missing child.

150
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,870
<i>What's your relation
to the child, ma'am?</i>

151
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,346
It's my son.

152
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,642
<i>How long has he been gone?</i>

153
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,110
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.

154
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,616
It could be
since this morning

155
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,419
or it could be
just the last hour.

156
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,549
<i>Have you checked
around the neighborhood?</i>

157
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,355
Yes, of course I did.

158
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,487
<i>Well, maybe
he's lost track of time.</i>

159
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,825
No. No, no.

160
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:36,334
He always stays around the
house when it gets dark.

161
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,460
Would you please send
someone down here?

162
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,935
<i>I'm sorry,
but our policy is that</i>

163
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:43,964
<i>we don't dispatch units on
missing child cases for 24 hours.</i>

164
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,302
What?

165
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,836
<i>Look, 99 times out of 100,
the kid shows up by morning.</i>

166
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:53,816
<i>We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.</i>

167
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,978
No, no, no.

168
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,681
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.

169
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:02,090
<i>With all due respect, ma'am, every
parent who calls says the same thing.</i>

170
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:05,187
Please, please.

171
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,925
<i>Look, there's
nothing I can do.</i>

172
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,466
<i>I'll take your name
and your information,</i>

173
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,161
<i>but that's all until the
morning, at the earliest.</i>

174
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,262
<i>I'm sure he'll show up
by then. They always do.</i>

175
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,429
Are you Mrs. Collins?

176
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:03,712
<i>Our thoughts go out again
today to Mrs. Christine Collins</i>

177
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,222
<i>of Lincoln Heights,</i>

178
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,451
<i>whose young son,
Walter Collins,</i>

179
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:10,051
<i>disappeared
nearly two weeks ago.</i>

180
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,587
<i>Though she is not a
member of our congregation,</i>

181
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,394
<i>we pray for her today
as we have every day,</i>

182
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,704
<i>since we learned
of her plight.</i>

183
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,639
<i>On the radio and
in the newspapers</i>

184
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,645
<i>we are told that the Los
Angeles Police Department</i>

185
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:32,309
<i>is doing its very best to
reunite mother and child,</i>

186
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,784
<i>and I'm sure
that that is true.</i>

187
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:40,951
<i>But given its status as
the most violent, corrupt</i>

188
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,994
<i>and incompetent
police department</i>

189
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,291
<i>this side
of the Rocky Mountains</i>

190
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,822
<i>I am not sure
it's saying a great deal.</i>

191
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:59,807
<i>Every day, new bodies
appear along Mulholland</i>

192
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:01,903
<i>and in the ditches
of our cities,</i>

193
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,385
<i>the work of Police Chief James
Davis and his aptly named Gun Squad.</i>

194
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:11,820
<i>Every day, the needs
of honest citizens</i>

195
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,122
<i>are put second to greed
and personal gain.</i>

196
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:22,689
<i>Every day, this city sinks
deeper into a cesspool</i>

197
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:27,569
<i>of fear, intimidation
and corruption.</i>

198
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,039
<i>Once the City of Angels,</i>

199
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:35,171
<i>Los Angeles has become
a place where our protectors</i>

200
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,738
<i>have become
our brutalizers.</i>

201
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:42,780
<i>Where to be the law is
to be above the law.</i>

202
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,160
I understand.
Thank you.

203
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,034
I will call back
in a few weeks.

204
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,370
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,943
Las Vegas Missing
Persons Department?

206
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:44,244
Hello, this is
Christine Collins.

207
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:47,183
I'm calling to see if you've
found any missing or lost children

208
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:51,120
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

209
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,026
Oh, all right. Well,
please do. Please do call.

210
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:57,652
And I'll call back
in a matter...

211
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,493
In a week, if that's all
right. Thank you very much.

212
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,554
Thank you.

213
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,477
$2.

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,458
Hell, I think I left
my wallet at home.

215
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,429
Can I owe it to you?

216
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:34,926
No credit.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,661
Pay up or I
call the cops.

218
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,566
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

219
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,070
I'm not trying to
stiff you, chief.

220
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,629
I just left my wallet
at home, that's all.

221
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:45,676
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

222
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,641
Got collateral?

223
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,481
You can't ask for
better collateral

224
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,849
than a man's own flesh
and blood, right?

225
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,445
Now, you stay here, son.

226
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,054
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,649
But... Now, don't give me any trouble.

228
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,717
He's a good man to
trust us like this.

229
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:08,363
Now, you just stay here and
I'll go back and get my wallet.

230
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:14,070
Ten minutes,
then I call the cops.

231
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,739
Ah, hell.

232
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,313
<i>Number, please.
Hello, Myrtle?</i>

233
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,255
<i>Hello? Yeah, this is
Harve, down at the diner.</i>

234
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:35,384
<i>Oh, hi, Harve.</i>

235
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,620
Would you get me
Sheriff Larsen?

236
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:37,593
<i>Sure thing.</i>

237
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,126
You have
a nice day, too.

238
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,630
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

239
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,570
I can't seem
to get through.

240
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,040
I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.

241
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,415
You have a person to
person call, Fairfax 2231.

242
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:59,973
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

243
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,814
I'll connect you
right away, ma'am.

244
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,249
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,166
Mrs. Collins?

246
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,560
Yes.

247
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:23,339
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

248
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,938
My office supervises all
runaway and missing child cases,

249
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,878
including your son's,
and...

250
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,547
He's alive,
Mrs. Collins.

251
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:39,355
He was picked up two days ago by
local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

252
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,857
He's safe and unhurt.

253
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,356
He was in the company of some
drifter. We have an APB out for him,

254
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,455
but he's safe.

255
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,467
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,731
Oh, Christine...

257
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,037
That is so great.

258
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,075
Thank you.

259
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,726
There's
so much press.

260
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,803
Yours is a story with a
happy ending, Mrs. Collins.

261
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,067
People love happy endings.

262
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,505
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

263
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,014
Back, boys. Back.

264
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,146
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!

265
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,707
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,

266
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:41,843
but the important
thing right now

267
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,683
is to reunite this
little lady with her son,

268
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,120
so if you'll excuse us.

269
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,388
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

270
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,558
Easy, easy.

271
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,024
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to
introduce you to James E. Davis,

272
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,296
Chief of Police.

273
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,359
Very nice to meet you.

274
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:00,802
We don't get a lot
of positive attention

275
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,362
from the boys in the
press these days,

276
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,931
so it's good to be here with a
positive story, don't you think?

277
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,067
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:10,513
I take it you've been treated
well by my boys in the department?

279
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:12,675
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,

280
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,013
and I thought that
maybe that was a...

281
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:15,518
Technicalities aside.

282
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,715
It was wonderful.

283
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,916
Well, good.

284
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,860
Then you won't have any trouble
telling that to the press,

285
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,862
and the fact that the LAPD...

286
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,226
Women.

287
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:31,461
Hold on a second.

288
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,135
Back, boys, back.

289
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,376
Keep them back.

290
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,860
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...

291
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,200
That's not my son.

292
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,636
What?

293
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,209
What are you saying?

294
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,277
It's not my son.

295
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,714
Well, I'm sure
you're mistaken.

296
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:20,876
I'm not mistaken.

297
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,580
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

298
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,782
He's lost weight,
he's changed.

299
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,552
I would know my own son.

300
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,423
All I'm saying is you're
in shock and he's changed.

301
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:33,958
What's your name? Can
you tell me your name?

302
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:35,659
Walter Collins.

303
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,392
It's a common name.

304
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,632
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

305
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:44,937
I live at 210 Avenue 23,

306
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,267
Los Angeles, California.

307
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,245
And that's my mommy!

308
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:57,385
Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.

309
00:22:57,455 --> 00:23:00,447
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.

310
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,891
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.

311
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,896
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

312
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,933
And there's no question
that this is your son.

313
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,025
That is not Walter.

314
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:15,206
It's not Walter
as you remember him.

315
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:19,905
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.

316
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,870
A trial basis?

317
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,005
Yes, yes.

318
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:27,609
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,

319
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,621
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

320
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:34,453
you will see that
this is your Walter.

321
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,086
Now, I promise you, I swear
to you, I give you my word.

322
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,788
This is your son.

323
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:42,424
Now, if you have any problems, any problems
at all, you come and you talk to me.

324
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,831
I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,835
I give you my word.
Trust me.

326
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:51,898
Mrs. Collins, he has
nowhere else to go.

327
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:56,875
Please.

328
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:04,011
Maybe I'm not
thinking clearly.

329
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,919
And...

330
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:08,518
All right.

331
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,118
All right, you're not
thinking clearly, that's right.

332
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,628
Here we go!

333
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,462
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:16,591
Here, just turn
around here.

335
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,730
How does it feel to have
your son home, Mrs. Collins?

336
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,794
What'd you think when you
saw him for the first time?

337
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,170
It's hard to explain.

338
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,072
She was
shocked at first.

339
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:28,112
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

340
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,544
He's been through
quite an ordeal.

341
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,081
How're you feeling, son?

342
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:32,207
Bet it feels great
to be home.

343
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:33,580
Yeah. It's great.

344
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,812
The Los Angeles Police
Department is thankful

345
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,084
for all the hard work done by the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

346
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,785
in making this joyful
reunion possible.

347
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:44,555
The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times.

348
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:47,257
Can we get a photo with
mother and son, Captain?

349
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,527
Absolutely! Here we are.

350
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,361
Like that.
Like that.

351
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:53,996
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.

352
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,635
This way, Walter.
Big smile.

353
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:58,769
One more, please.
That's a good one.

354
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:01,105
One more.

355
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,099
The sandwich all right?

356
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,103
Would you like
some more milk?

357
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,298
No.

358
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,937
No, thank you.

359
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:33,671
No, thank you.

360
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:44,111
You're covered in soot from the
train. You should take a bath.

361
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:57,994
Pajamas are on the
edge of the bed.

362
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,700
You okay?
You all right?

363
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,742
I fell. Stupid tub!

364
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,239
That's all right.

365
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,711
You're circumcised.

366
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:18,486
Get out.

367
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,018
Move.

368
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,028
Last time
I measured Walter,

369
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:36,369
last time
I measured my son,

370
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,500
he was inches taller
than you are now.

371
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:40,877
Who are you?

372
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,105
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,739
Who are you?

374
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,213
Who are you?

375
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,864
He's not my son.

376
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:04,993
Mrs. Collins...

377
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,196
No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,

378
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,000
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

379
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,098
I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.

380
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,836
He's three inches shorter.

381
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,542
I measured him
on the chart.

382
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,011
Well, maybe your
measurements are off.

383
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,015
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this.

384
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,414
He's circumcised.

385
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,383
And Walter isn't.

386
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:24,950
Mrs. Collins.

387
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,591
Your son was missing
for five months.

388
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:35,223
For at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter.

389
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,132
Who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done?

390
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,997
He could have had him
circumcised. He could have...

391
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:43,540
Made him shorter?

392
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,844
Why aren't you
listening to me?

393
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:52,906
I am listening, damn it, I am listening.

394
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,508
And I understand
your feelings.

395
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,712
He's changed, no mistake, and that's...

396
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,415
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

397
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:01,390
and that's why he needs your
love and support to bounce back.

398
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:02,982
He's not my son!

399
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,255
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Collins?

400
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,422
Why are you doing this?

401
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:10,558
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

402
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,035
Your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs,

403
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,833
so I don't understand
why you're running away

404
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,703
from your responsibilities
as a mother.

405
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,038
I am not running away
from anything!

406
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,577
Least of all
my responsibilities!

407
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:23,239
I am even taking care
of that boy right now,

408
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,145
because I am all he has!

409
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,514
What worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son!

410
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:32,079
Why should we be looking for
someone we've already found?

411
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,584
Because you have
not found him.

412
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,094
His identity
has been confirmed

413
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:41,654
by the best minds in the
field of child identification,

414
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,930
people who know
what they're doing.

415
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,400
And I don't?

416
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,853
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,849
I appreciate everything that
this department has done

418
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:11,053
and I know
how hard you're working.

419
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:14,222
I really do, and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

420
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:17,062
I just... There has
been a terrible mistake,

421
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:19,295
and I need you to
help me correct it,

422
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,205
so I can find my son
before it's too late.

423
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,603
Please.

424
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:40,317
I won't take up any more of
your time. I'm sorry I got upset.

425
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:42,325
I'm sorry, very sorry.

426
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:55,995
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

427
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:58,064
Sara, get Dr. Tarr
on the phone.

428
00:29:58,142 --> 00:29:59,268
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

429
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:05,606
Mrs. Collins?
Yes?

430
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:07,310
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

431
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,409
Captain Jones sent me.

432
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:10,920
I consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases.

433
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,353
May I come in?

434
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,591
Yes, thank you for coming.

435
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:16,456
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

436
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:19,894
Well, I'm here now, and
we'll put all that to rights.

437
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:22,723
Where's the boy?

438
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:27,494
Ah! There he is.

439
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,500
A handsome young man.

440
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,039
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?

441
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,340
And a little bit
of the nose.

442
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:38,741
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.

443
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,115
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.

444
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,748
I thought you were
here to help me.

445
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:46,312
Well, I am.

446
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,826
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes

447
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,418
and asked me
to drop in on him

448
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:54,089
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.

449
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:59,559
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.

450
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:04,799
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

451
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,274
now will they?

452
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:10,275
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

453
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,206
Yes.

454
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,648
Come.

455
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,118
Against the wall.

456
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,517
He's
three inches shorter.

457
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:26,058
Ah, well...

458
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,660
Hardly a mystery,
Mrs. Collins.

459
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:35,035
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

460
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,267
Given the stress
of the past five months,

461
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,801
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

462
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:42,846
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

463
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,881
And circumcision?

464
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:54,150
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

465
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,989
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

466
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,365
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.

467
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,395
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

468
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:08,862
I...

469
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:13,273
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

470
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:16,709
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

471
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,807
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

472
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,943
during his absence.

473
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,284
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?

474
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,747
I'm the mother.

475
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,783
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

476
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:35,758
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy

477
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:38,431
who has changed
from what you remember.

478
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:40,527
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

479
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:42,731
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns

480
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,638
is not the same anymore.

481
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:49,372
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,

482
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,881
sees these changes
and rebels,

483
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,915
insists that
this isn't your son.

484
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:58,316
Doesn't change the facts.

485
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:06,392
I'm willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

486
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,596
Are you?

487
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:18,000
<i>It is
absolutely outrageous!</i>

488
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,976
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.

489
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:25,106
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

490
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:29,651
This so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood,

491
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,053
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

492
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,115
<i>And what
was his findings?</i>

493
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:37,456
He found what he
expected to find,

494
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:41,130
what you obviously
told him he would find.

495
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:42,665
<i>Mrs. Collins.
But that's not...</i>

496
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:44,394
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

497
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:48,962
That I was embarrassed
is not the issue.

498
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,077
The point is that
you are wasting time

499
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:57,308
when you should be
looking for my son.

500
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,441
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.

501
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:04,615
Well, then I want to receive
the report, so I can refute it,

502
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,622
before it goes
to anyone else.

503
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,918
Fine.

504
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,090
Yes. Good day.

505
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,869
I'm finished. Could I
go to my room now?

506
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:24,967
Yes.

507
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,179
Good night, Mommy.

508
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,919
Stop saying that!

509
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,451
Stop saying that!

510
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:45,627
I'm not your mother!

511
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,260
I want my son back.

512
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:54,964
You're not him.
You're not my son!

513
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,035
I want my son back.

514
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,470
I want my son back!

515
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,379
Damn you!

516
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,918
I want my son back!

517
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,349
I was wrong
to yell at you.

518
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,083
You're just a child

519
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:53,358
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,

520
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,421
and the hurt
you're causing.

521
00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:00,937
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

522
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,201
He's all I have.

523
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:11,542
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

524
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,947
you and I,

525
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:19,045
we both know the truth,
don't we?

526
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:23,622
We both know that
you're not Walter.

527
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:27,687
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

528
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,733
so they can find my son.

529
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,566
Please.

530
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:44,046
We can talk tomorrow.

531
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,028
Hello?

532
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:09,129
<i>Is this
Mrs. Christine Collins?</i>

533
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,764
Yes.

534
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:12,433
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

535
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:15,876
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.

536
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:19,182
Oh, yes, I've heard
your broadcasts.

537
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:20,773
I'm...

538
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,751
Thank you.

539
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,380
<i>Have you read
the Times this morning?</i>

540
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:26,582
No.

541
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:31,289
<i>Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish</i>

542
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:34,422
for breakfast, in, say, an
hour. I think we should meet.

543
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,261
Hello?

544
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:48,268
"Mysterious case of...

545
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:50,711
"Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

546
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:54,945
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child
specialist, examined Walter Collins

547
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:56,815
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,

548
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:59,549
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition

549
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:00,817
"noticed since the
return of the boy

550
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:03,382
"To his mother last Monday. "

551
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:07,192
Lovely bit of phrasing,
isn't it?

552
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:10,290
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.

553
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,131
Now, not only does that clearly
state you're the boy's mother,

554
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:17,572
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.

555
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,939
And that the police
department is concerned

556
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,774
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.

557
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,337
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.

558
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:29,611
"'I examined the boy quite
thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,

559
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,154
"'And it's clear that
he has something to tell.

560
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:33,621
"'I'm sure that in time... "'

561
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,820
...time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair,

562
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:40,693
but not until he has
faith in his listener.

563
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:44,757
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

564
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:48,994
Course of my examination, I found
nothing to dispute the findings

565
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,869
of the LAPD.

566
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,303
Why would they do this?

567
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:57,370
To avoid admitting
they made a mistake

568
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,109
when they brought
back the wrong boy.

569
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,845
Of course, anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain

570
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,978
would see
through it instantly.

571
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:08,047
<i>Sadly, that would exclude about
half the readership of the Times.</i>

572
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:13,157
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things

573
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,791
the LAPD wish none
of us ever knew about.

574
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:22,897
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

575
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:27,440
When Chief Davis took over the
force two years ago, he said...

576
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,878
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

577
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,883
I want them brought
in dead, not alive,

578
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:37,785
and I will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal.

579
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:41,324
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,

580
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,952
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

581
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,519
He called them
the Gun Squad.

582
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:52,902
<i>No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.</i>

583
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,835
Just piles of bodies.

584
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:59,802
<i>Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.</i>

585
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:04,280
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.

586
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:07,909
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.

587
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,010
Mayor Cryer and half
the force are on the take.

588
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:13,215
<i>Gambling, prostitution,
bootlegging, you name it.</i>

589
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,555
<i>Because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want,</i>

590
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:21,428
as the Lord found in the Garden
of Eden, they will do exactly that.

591
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:25,332
This police department does not
tolerate dissent, or contradiction,

592
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,802
or even embarrassment.

593
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:32,638
And you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it.

594
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,576
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.

595
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:39,241
I've seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now.

596
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,375
That's why I wanted
to meet you,

597
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,284
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into

598
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:47,812
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.

599
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,291
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing

600
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,761
and everything
that you said,

601
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,724
but I'm not on a mission.

602
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,825
I just want my son home.

603
00:41:00,804 --> 00:41:03,102
Mrs. Collins, a lot
of mothers' sons

604
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:06,336
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.

605
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,708
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

606
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:12,146
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

607
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,455
He had two cavities
that needed filling.

608
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:25,188
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

609
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,524
And?

610
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:30,260
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.

611
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,825
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

612
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,337
The boy in that room
has no such gap.

613
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,669
Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.

614
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,174
In some cases,
yes, it's possible.

615
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:42,541
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.

616
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:45,980
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

617
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:49,746
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.

618
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,189
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?

619
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:56,020
Pardon my language,
but hell yes.

620
00:41:57,661 --> 00:42:00,926
Sounds like the
anesthetic's wearing off.

621
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:04,365
On the other hand, maybe
I'll write that letter first.

622
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,494
Give the little fella
something to think about.

623
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,378
Well, if it is,
he's changed enormously.

624
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,349
Do you know who I am?

625
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:22,715
You're a teacher.

626
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:25,949
Yes, but even teachers
have names. What's mine?

627
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,654
I don't remember.

628
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,558
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.

629
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,195
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.

630
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,273
I didn't say take a seat. I said
take your seat, the one assigned you.

631
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:59,015
You must know where it is, you've
been sitting in it for over a year now.

632
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:10,792
Mrs. Collins, if that's your
son, I'll eat my yardstick.

633
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:14,268
Not only will I put it in writing, I
will testify to it in a court of law

634
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:18,068
or to the President Calvin
Coolidge himself if I have to.

635
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:20,368
Thank you.

636
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,273
I'll see you tonight
for the broadcast.

637
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:26,679
Good luck.

638
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,154
Quick question, ma'am.

639
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:38,421
Quick question!

640
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:40,224
Mrs. Collins.

641
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,558
Hello. My name is
Christine Collins.

642
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,828
Good morning.
Good morning.

643
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:50,464
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

644
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,269
And a five-month investigation

645
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:56,301
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

646
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,747
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

647
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,682
He was not my son.

648
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,687
The LAPD made a mistake,

649
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,452
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

650
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,993
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

651
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:13,461
all confirming that
he is not my son.

652
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,660
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.

653
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:21,192
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake

654
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:23,535
and renew the
search for my son.

655
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,507
Since they have
refused to do so,

656
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:28,476
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

657
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:32,242
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

658
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:34,977
and bring my son home to me.

659
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:36,541
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:50,927
Morelli!

661
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,901
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.

662
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,200
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.

663
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:57,331
Yes, sir.

664
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:09,842
This way, miss.

665
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:11,945
Why are we going
in the back?

666
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,786
Captain's orders. Front's
jammed with reporters.

667
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:22,425
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.

668
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:26,799
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

669
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:28,165
What'd they do,
lose a moose?

670
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:31,469
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

671
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,942
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

672
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:36,069
You want it?
I'll take it.

673
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:37,204
Got nothing better to do.

674
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,713
You're a prince.

675
00:45:41,184 --> 00:45:42,617
Mrs. Collins.

676
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:45,883
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

677
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,289
Sit.

678
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:55,763
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

679
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:58,858
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

680
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:00,459
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.

681
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,004
Oh, no, of course not.

682
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:05,769
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment

683
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:08,037
for the months we spent
working on your case.

684
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:10,477
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?

685
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,674
Of course not.

686
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:13,977
I want you to find my son.

687
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,813
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?

688
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:17,820
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

689
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:19,048
What?

690
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,181
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?

691
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:23,317
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

692
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:25,918
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,

693
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:27,793
see anyone you wanted.

694
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:30,355
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

695
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:32,663
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.

696
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,534
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

697
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:38,438
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.

698
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:40,271
Isn't that true?
That is not true!

699
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:42,675
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.

700
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,043
Why would he say that?

701
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:45,775
How would he know
to do that?

702
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:47,817
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

703
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:50,250
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

704
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,584
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

705
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,521
Lying was born
in both of you.

706
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,616
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,

707
00:46:56,693 --> 00:46:58,684
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.

708
00:46:58,762 --> 00:46:59,820
Now wait a minute.

709
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:01,761
Because either
you know you're lying,

710
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:05,562
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

711
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:07,159
So, which is it?

712
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:11,131
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

713
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:13,402
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

714
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:14,807
I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.

715
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:17,142
You want experts? You want
doctors? I have a few of my own.

716
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:18,407
Matron.

717
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:26,287
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son?

718
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,687
Yes, I do.

719
00:47:31,194 --> 00:47:32,491
Please, don't struggle.
What?

720
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:33,722
No!
You'll only hurt yourself.

721
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:35,059
What are you doing?
Hold still.

722
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:36,689
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.

723
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:37,892
You are to
convey the prisoner

724
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,061
to the Los Angeles County General
Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

725
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,296
What?

726
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:43,566
You are to make
the following entry.

727
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,234
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,

728
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,799
and that we have given
her a boy and tried

729
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:50,675
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.

730
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:53,841
Take her away.
No. No, no.

731
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:56,179
Please. Please.

732
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:57,412
Come on,
Mrs. Collins.

733
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,387
No. No.

734
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:00,616
This way.

735
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:08,864
<i>Mrs. Collins has been known to
us since about March 10th, 1928</i>

736
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:11,730
<i>when she reported her
nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.</i>

737
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,463
<i>The boy was gone until
August 1928. Okay.</i>

738
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:18,433
<i>Since his return, she has
complained that he is still missing</i>

739
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:21,170
<i>and has made repeated
requests that he be found.</i>

740
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:26,341
<i>She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality.</i>

741
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,910
<i>She may be a threat
to herself or others.</i>

742
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:33,682
<i>We recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward</i>

743
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:35,452
<i>until her senses
can be restored.</i>

744
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:36,787
Got another code 12.

745
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,952
Name?

746
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:39,086
Collins. Christine.

747
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:40,629
No, no, no, listen,
this is a mistake.

748
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:41,959
Certifying officer?

749
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,523
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

750
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:46,592
No, no, please! Please! The
police are trying to punish me...

751
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:48,762
If you keep it up, I'm gonna
have to put you in a straitjacket.

752
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:50,100
Do you want that?

753
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:51,231
No, ma'am.

754
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:53,707
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.

755
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,405
I'm not mad!

756
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,844
Please.

757
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:00,977
Oh, God.

758
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:02,382
All right.

759
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:08,919
No!

760
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:19,028
Stop!

761
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:26,902
Spread your legs.

762
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:28,569
What?

763
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:33,582
Wider.

764
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,277
Oh.

765
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:48,929
I'm not sick!

766
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:56,665
Touch me! Touch me!

767
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,200
Inside. This is your room.

768
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:03,370
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

769
00:50:03,446 --> 00:50:05,812
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

770
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:07,008
Sorry.

771
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:11,747
My room! No. No, no,
no, this is my room.

772
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,180
Can I make
a phone call?

773
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:15,224
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.

774
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:19,022
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

775
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,528
This is for your own good.
Help me!

776
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:22,189
Listen to me.

777
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:24,096
My room.

778
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,863
No,
this is my room.

779
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,201
Oh, God!

780
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:30,569
My room.

781
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:35,236
No, no,
this is my room.

782
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:39,445
My room.

783
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:45,080
My room! My room!
My room!

784
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:47,583
My room!

785
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:50,558
They said it was my room!

786
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,573
You have a problem?

787
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,042
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.

788
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:10,869
Hey, listen, could
you give me a hand?

789
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:14,747
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

790
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:18,016
Northcott Ranch, huh?

791
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,590
Oh, yeah, yeah.

792
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,758
You're almost there.

793
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:31,357
You just... You just
follow this road west,

794
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:34,062
about two, no, three miles.

795
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:36,662
And then you take
that next right.

796
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,197
And you stay on that and it
will bring you right to it.

797
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,077
Is something going
on out there?

798
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:46,274
No.

799
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:48,510
Just looking into
a juvenile matter.

800
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:50,913
Thanks for your help.

801
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,181
Sure.

802
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,262
Hello?

803
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:28,008
Hey!

804
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,518
Hey! Hey!

805
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:33,646
Come here!
Come here!

806
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:40,891
This is the police!

807
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:44,126
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.

808
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,795
Open the door
or stand aside.

809
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:02,543
Hey! Stop!

810
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:06,911
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

811
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:10,043
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!

812
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:11,177
Stop it!

813
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:12,312
Fine!

814
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,789
Give me your hands.

815
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,028
Come on.
Sit down.

816
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,832
Jesus!

817
00:55:30,473 --> 00:55:31,906
What the hell is
wrong with you, kid?

818
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:33,407
Huh?

819
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,341
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?

820
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,606
What difference
does it make?

821
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:41,843
We're just sending you
back to Canada, son.

822
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:44,079
It isn't the end
of the world.

823
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,948
What?

824
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:51,554
Well, you can't stay in the
U.S. As long as you want, pal.

825
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,857
No word from Mrs. Collins?

826
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,299
We haven't heard from her.

827
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:01,563
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

828
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:03,127
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

829
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,264
Find out what they know.

830
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,398
Absolutely.

831
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,535
<i>And now KGF welcomes the
Reverend Gustav Briegleb</i>

832
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,772
<i>of St. Paul's Presbyterian.</i>

833
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,249
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

834
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:18,185
bringing you the Lord's
word on Radio KGF.

835
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:19,915
Good evening.

836
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:21,923
I had hoped to have
a guest with us tonight,

837
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:24,289
but apparently
she has been delayed.

838
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,319
<i>And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,</i>

839
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:31,025
<i>I'll have to fill in
as best I can.</i>

840
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,863
<i>I'm going to tell
you what happened</i>

841
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:37,201
<i>and I'm going to keep on telling
you every night, right here,</i>

842
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:40,333
<i>until somebody does
something about it.</i>

843
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:47,207
<i>The Desert Local,
train number 45,</i>

844
00:56:47,283 --> 00:56:50,582
<i>will be arriving on
track two in five minutes.</i>

845
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,279
Hello. I'd like a
ticket to Canada.

846
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:55,586
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

847
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,626
I don't have anything
going that far tonight.

848
00:56:57,693 --> 00:56:59,923
The best I can do is put
you on a train to Seattle.

849
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,760
From there you can transfer to a
local or drive across the border.

850
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:04,231
That would be fine.

851
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,494
Roundtrip?

852
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:06,728
One way.

853
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,235
That'll be $15.

854
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:09,362
Right.

855
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,602
There you go.

856
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:16,201
Thank you. There you
go. Enjoy your trip.

857
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:17,473
I will.

858
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:37,122
Breakfast is half an hour.

859
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:44,069
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.

860
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,607
The dining room
is down the hall.

861
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:48,576
The doctor will call
for you when he's ready.

862
00:58:00,556 --> 00:58:02,751
Do you want
eggs or oatmeal?

863
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:06,255
Okay, that's everyone
that's here.

864
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,694
All right.

865
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,628
You can pull the oatmeal.

866
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,064
Do you want
it for tomorrow?

867
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:12,498
You know, just dump it. All right.

868
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,092
You should eat.

869
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,868
Eating is normal.

870
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:19,737
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.

871
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,276
It's the only chance
you got.

872
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,504
I'm not hungry.

873
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:24,842
Barbara, you have to
eat now. I'm not hungry.

874
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:27,439
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?

875
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,050
Christine.
Christine Collins.

876
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,283
Now, finish it all. I know
it's hard, but you gotta try.

877
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:35,654
Oh, boy.

878
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,262
I heard them talking.

879
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,392
You're here on code 12?

880
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,130
Police action.

881
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,728
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure

882
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,136
that if the police
brought you here,

883
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:53,232
there must be
a good reason for it.

884
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:55,709
There isn't a good
reason for it.

885
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:59,477
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.

886
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:01,240
How?

887
00:59:02,385 --> 00:59:06,116
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

888
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:10,022
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

889
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:12,856
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

890
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:17,490
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.

891
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,001
You've given this
a lot of thought.

892
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:25,734
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

893
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:28,975
You're a code 12,
so am I.

894
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:31,240
We're here for the
exact same reasons.

895
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:33,440
We both pissed
off the cops.

896
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:37,452
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?

897
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,954
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

898
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:43,048
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.

899
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,387
I want more juice.

900
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,654
And that one?

901
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:47,059
Put your tray
back where it belongs.

902
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:51,361
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.

903
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,868
When she tried to
tell the papers...

904
00:59:56,439 --> 00:59:57,667
And you?

905
00:59:58,874 --> 01:00:01,866
I work nights.

906
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:03,901
Sure.

907
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:08,113
I mean, I work nights.

908
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:10,977
Oh.

909
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,213
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

910
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,346
I'm sorry.

911
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:17,222
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

912
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:19,352
so I filed a complaint.

913
01:00:19,428 --> 01:00:21,896
And it turns out
he was a cop.

914
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:24,091
Next thing I know,
I'm here.

915
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:26,859
But they can't do that.

916
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:27,994
Are you kidding?

917
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,594
All right, one
more and then that's it.

918
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:32,140
Everybody knows
women are fragile.

919
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,476
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

920
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,136
Somebody! Help me!

921
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,875
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,

922
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:41,507
they just go fucking nuts.

923
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:42,710
Pardon my French.

924
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:44,514
You gotta get those dishes. You got it.

925
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:48,318
If we're insane, nobody
has to listen to us.

926
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:51,152
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,

927
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:54,560
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,

928
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,393
or a police officer?

929
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,160
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,

930
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:02,898
or we don't go home.

931
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:04,599
Are you all done?

932
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,843
Or we go home like that.

933
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:48,005
Stop. Stop it.

934
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:51,148
Stop it!
Stop it.

935
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:52,447
Please.

936
01:01:55,157 --> 01:01:56,317
Clark.

937
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,849
Sanford Clark?

938
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:00,821
Here.

939
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:03,856
Paperwork's come through.

940
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:06,367
You'll be deported back to
Canada day after tomorrow.

941
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,699
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

942
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:12,070
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border

943
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:13,904
illegally in the future.

944
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:15,135
Wait!

945
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:20,510
I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.

946
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,380
I'm sure he has far
more important things...

947
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,749
Please. It's important.

948
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,255
Christine Collins.

949
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:35,991
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

950
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:40,496
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.

951
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,577
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

952
01:02:52,514 --> 01:02:53,640
Yes.

953
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,616
Really?

954
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:59,176
I'd think it'd
be quite difficult at first.

955
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,018
Yes, it was.

956
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:06,892
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

957
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:20,573
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

958
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,607
The Wassermman Test.

959
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,809
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.

960
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,717
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,

961
01:03:31,787 --> 01:03:33,652
does that upset you?

962
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,054
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.

963
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,525
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

964
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,459
We have to cover
all our bases.

965
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:41,962
I can imagine

966
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:46,928
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable,

967
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:49,163
but I understood.

968
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:13,026
According to your file you
believe that the police substituted

969
01:04:13,128 --> 01:04:15,221
a fake boy for your son.

970
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:17,492
No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.

971
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,659
He's not my boy.

972
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,168
They brought home
the wrong boy.

973
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:23,204
My son is still missing.

974
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:28,274
Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article

975
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:34,239
with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.

976
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,314
That is you in the
photo, isn't it?

977
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:40,912
Yes.

978
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,082
Yeah.

979
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:43,815
Yes.

980
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:46,827
So, at first
he was your son,

981
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,127
and now he's not your son.

982
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:54,001
Has this been going
on for a long time?

983
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:57,698
People changing, becoming
something other than what they are?

984
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,638
People don't change.

985
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,266
You don't think
people change?

986
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:02,435
No, that's not...

987
01:05:06,081 --> 01:05:08,345
The police, they're not
out to persecute you?

988
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:10,777
No, they're not.

989
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:13,947
The police are here
to protect you.

990
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,985
Yes.

991
01:05:16,225 --> 01:05:17,658
Really?

992
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:18,784
Yes.

993
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:24,231
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,

994
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,435
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

995
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:35,976
So, either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you

996
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,275
or you're changing
your story.

997
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:50,616
Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

998
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,119
No.

999
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,033
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

1000
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,101
but the boy has
been quite insistent.

1001
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:11,544
It's all right.

1002
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:14,548
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

1003
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:17,244
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

1004
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,617
so this had better
be worth it.

1005
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:21,713
You again, huh?

1006
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,557
We'll see.

1007
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:34,394
Well?

1008
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:38,467
This isn't easy, okay?

1009
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,529
Yeah?

1010
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:42,941
Driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn't easy either.

1011
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:47,377
My cousin is
Gordon Northcott.

1012
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:50,043
He owns the ranch
where you found me.

1013
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:55,046
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,

1014
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:58,085
doing chores
and stuff like that.

1015
01:06:59,628 --> 01:07:02,426
Said I could stay as
long as I wanted to.

1016
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:06,128
I thought that meant I could
leave whenever I wanted.

1017
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:07,259
Mmm.

1018
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:09,634
You saying that he
held you prisoner?

1019
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:10,865
Bull.

1020
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,806
When I got there, you were
running around free as a jaybird.

1021
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,810
Could've left any
time you wanted.

1022
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:16,902
No.

1023
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:18,741
So, what's this, huh?

1024
01:07:18,847 --> 01:07:20,872
Some kind of story to cover why
you're in the country illegally?

1025
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,075
No, it's nothing like that.

1026
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,209
'Cause I don't have
time for this, okay?

1027
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:24,445
Listen to me!
He said...

1028
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,782
What?

1029
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:27,583
What did he say?

1030
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:30,955
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.

1031
01:07:31,026 --> 01:07:34,052
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

1032
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:37,462
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

1033
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,435
All right.

1034
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:43,937
Let's start at
the beginning then.

1035
01:07:47,576 --> 01:07:49,669
What'd he make you do?

1036
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:56,449
We killed some kids.

1037
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:57,780
What?

1038
01:07:57,853 --> 01:08:01,448
Look, I didn't mean to, I
swear. He made me help him.

1039
01:08:01,523 --> 01:08:04,117
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1040
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,889
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.

1041
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,954
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

1042
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,397
Look.

1043
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:14,299
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?

1044
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:16,894
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1045
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,462
Names?

1046
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,564
How many?

1047
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,131
How many kids?

1048
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,575
All together?

1049
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,847
About 20, I guess.

1050
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,618
No, you're lying.

1051
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:34,053
No! It's true, I swear!

1052
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:35,783
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

1053
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:39,315
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1054
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:44,063
I stopped counting
after a while.

1055
01:08:47,903 --> 01:08:51,669
Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.

1056
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:56,401
But...

1057
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:57,502
No.

1058
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:00,412
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

1059
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:01,676
We did.

1060
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:05,280
We did.

1061
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,248
How?

1062
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,726
Most times we'd just
have one or two.

1063
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:17,298
Sometimes as many as three.

1064
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:23,099
<i>I always knew when we
were getting ready to leave.</i>

1065
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,269
<i>Clean up the car.</i>

1066
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,540
<i>Make sure the tires
were good.</i>

1067
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,277
<i>Check the engine.</i>

1068
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,442
<i>'Cause he was afraid that
the car would break down</i>

1069
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:41,987
<i>and we'd get caught.</i>

1070
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,889
<i>My loving baby</i>

1071
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:49,055
We'd always go a different
direction every time.

1072
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,299
Never hit the same
part of town twice.

1073
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,803
<i>Sometimes we'd just
drive around for hours,</i>

1074
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:58,906
<i>till we found somebody.</i>

1075
01:09:58,974 --> 01:10:00,498
Well, there you are!

1076
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:02,372
We've been looking
for you like mad.

1077
01:10:02,444 --> 01:10:03,706
You have?

1078
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:05,144
Sure thing.

1079
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:08,148
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

1080
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,248
And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.

1081
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,084
The police took them to the hospital, but
they didn't have time to come find you,

1082
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:16,147
so we said that
we would do it.

1083
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:17,824
Now, come on.

1084
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:20,453
All right.
Get in here. Hurry.

1085
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:23,862
Listen, we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks.

1086
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:27,163
<i>See, a lot of kids won't get
in a car alone with a stranger,</i>

1087
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:28,566
<i>but when he's got
a kid there...</i>

1088
01:10:28,637 --> 01:10:30,264
There's a good boy.

1089
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:31,738
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.

1090
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:33,365
<i>...that made it easier.</i>

1091
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:34,909
I want you to hold on tight.

1092
01:10:34,976 --> 01:10:36,273
<i>They'd look
at me and say...</i>

1093
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:37,607
We've got a long way to go.

1094
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:38,839
<i>"Hey, if he's safe... "</i>

1095
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:40,074
And we are gonna fly.

1096
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,412
<i>"... I guess
I will be, too. "</i>

1097
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,877
Every time they got
in the truck,

1098
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,682
I just wanted to die.

1099
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:54,490
As soon as we got back to the
ranch, they went in the coop.

1100
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:57,362
You boys hungry?

1101
01:10:57,432 --> 01:10:58,524
Huh?

1102
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,431
Watch the door, Sanford!

1103
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:02,503
Hey! Watch the door!

1104
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:04,838
What's the matter?

1105
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:06,168
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1106
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:07,731
Are you worried that
I'm gonna hurt you?

1107
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:08,901
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1108
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,444
Huh? Come here.

1109
01:11:10,512 --> 01:11:12,503
No! No! No! No! Please!
I would never hurt you.

1110
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:15,243
Some days
he'd do them right off.

1111
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:20,085
Other days he'd wait,

1112
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,788
pick up a few more,

1113
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:26,885
until he had about
four or five of them.

1114
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:28,588
Yeah.

1115
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:29,994
No! No! No!
No what?

1116
01:11:30,065 --> 01:11:31,157
No what, huh?

1117
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:33,729
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1118
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:35,736
Sanford, keep your
eye on that door!

1119
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:38,568
No! Please, no! No! No!

1120
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,007
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!

1121
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:46,973
He'd... He'd
sometimes leave

1122
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:51,382
just one or two of them
alive, barely, anyway.

1123
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,681
He'd say,

1124
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:55,552
"Finish them, San.

1125
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:58,923
"Finish them or... Finish
them or I'll finish you. "

1126
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,061
And I did.

1127
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:06,594
And I killed them.

1128
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:07,896
And I did.

1129
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:09,527
I killed them.

1130
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:11,504
Oh, God, I killed them!

1131
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,009
Oh, God! Oh!

1132
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,369
Hey.

1133
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:19,539
What?

1134
01:12:19,614 --> 01:12:20,979
Look at me.

1135
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:23,916
These kids.

1136
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:29,323
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?

1137
01:12:29,658 --> 01:12:31,785
I don't know.

1138
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,020
Maybe.

1139
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:36,719
Hey, I haven't updated
these in a while, but still.

1140
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:39,625
Just...

1141
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:43,432
It should be. Just go
through these, okay?

1142
01:12:48,309 --> 01:12:52,643
If you see any you recognize, just
put them down on the table here.

1143
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,083
I'm sorry!

1144
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,386
Oh, my God.

1145
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:42,986
I didn't mean to...
He made me.

1146
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,400
Oh, shit.

1147
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:56,843
This one. Look at me.

1148
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:00,942
You're sure?

1149
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:06,515
I'm sure.

1150
01:14:10,425 --> 01:14:11,483
Jesus Christ.

1151
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:15,791
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

1152
01:14:16,063 --> 01:14:17,530
Jesus Christ.

1153
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:20,332
Son of a bitch.

1154
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:24,766
Oh, God.

1155
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:27,772
Well, he's lying.

1156
01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:29,867
Have you gone soft
in the head, Les?

1157
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:31,002
Twenty kids, sir.

1158
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:32,067
<i>He's playing you.</i>

1159
01:14:32,146 --> 01:14:34,876
He knows he's in trouble, so he's
come up with some cock and bull story

1160
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,917
about how he was forced
to stay in the country.

1161
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:39,953
With all due respect, sir, I
don't think so. You didn't see him.

1162
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:42,012
This kid, he's scared
half out of his mind.

1163
01:14:42,089 --> 01:14:45,217
He picked the Collins kid.
We found him, remember?

1164
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:46,590
Haven't you been
reading the papers?

1165
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:49,524
Or maybe you have,
is that it?

1166
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:50,689
<i>Sir, if you'd just
listen to me...</i>

1167
01:14:50,765 --> 01:14:52,198
I'm sorry, Captain,
but he's here again.

1168
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:54,063
Who?
That Reverend Briegleb.

1169
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:55,966
He's asking about
Christine Collins.

1170
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,061
Well, you tell that
son of a bitch

1171
01:14:57,138 --> 01:14:58,696
to get the hell off
of police property,

1172
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:00,741
or I'll have him arrested
for disturbing the peace.

1173
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:03,868
I tried. He said he won't
leave, him or his friends.

1174
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:05,071
What?

1175
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:09,008
Oh, what the hell!

1176
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:12,309
Jesus!

1177
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:18,083
Oh, Jesus jumped down.

1178
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,257
<i>Captain?</i>

1179
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:21,784
<i>Ybarra?
Yeah.</i>

1180
01:15:21,863 --> 01:15:24,457
Listen to me. You're to do
nothing except get back here.

1181
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:26,466
<i>Sir, departmental
policy requires that</i>

1182
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:29,128
all allegations of homicide
have to be investigated.

1183
01:15:29,203 --> 01:15:30,295
These are kids,
for Christ sake.

1184
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:31,963
Departmental policy
is what I say it is.

1185
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:35,304
Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass
back here with that kid, you got that?

1186
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:38,277
You don't talk to anybody and
you bring me that kid. You got it?

1187
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:39,506
Nobody!

1188
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:55,018
Captain Jones.
Boys.

1189
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:57,530
What the hell have you done
with Christine Collins?

1190
01:15:57,598 --> 01:15:59,793
And don't try and lie
your way out of it,

1191
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:04,361
because several of her neighbors saw
her being driven away in a police car.

1192
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:07,038
Mrs. Collins has been placed
in protective custody

1193
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:09,076
following a mental breakdown.

1194
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:11,806
A what?

1195
01:16:12,246 --> 01:16:14,680
She's getting the best
treatment available.

1196
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:16,546
And that will be all.

1197
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,454
Next.

1198
01:16:21,522 --> 01:16:22,853
Go on. Move up.
For what?

1199
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:23,913
Medication.

1200
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:26,050
Medication for what?
The kind that's good for you.

1201
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:27,253
Help you relax.

1202
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:28,386
Well, I don't want to relax.
Come on.

1203
01:16:28,462 --> 01:16:29,827
I'm not gonna take something...
We can force-feed you

1204
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:31,296
if that's what you want.
I don't know what it is!

1205
01:16:31,365 --> 01:16:32,832
I don't know what it is.
Dr. Steele? Take it. Orderly.

1206
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:33,889
Dr. Steele?

1207
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:34,935
I understand. Come on.

1208
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:36,936
Ladies,
keep moving. Come on.

1209
01:16:37,004 --> 01:16:38,631
I don't wanna take anything
that I don't know what it is.

1210
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:40,936
There's nothing wrong with
me that I need medication.

1211
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:43,408
There's nothing
wrong with you.

1212
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:47,578
No, there's nothing wrong.
No.

1213
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:49,806
You're fine.
Yes, I am.

1214
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:55,321
Well, then you shouldn't
have any trouble signing this.

1215
01:16:56,924 --> 01:16:59,415
By signing it, you certify
that you were wrong

1216
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:02,360
when you stated the boy returned to
you by the police was not your son.

1217
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,864
It further stipulates
that the police were right

1218
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:06,866
in sending you here for
observation and it absolves them

1219
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:09,300
of all responsibility.
Sign it.

1220
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,099
I won't sign that.

1221
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,333
I won't sign that.

1222
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:16,274
Well, then your condition
is not improved.

1223
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:20,246
Sign it, and you can be out of
here first thing tomorrow morning.

1224
01:17:21,882 --> 01:17:23,577
But I wasn't wrong.

1225
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:25,585
He's not my son.
My son is still missing.

1226
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:28,349
Mrs. Collins,
you're becoming agitated.

1227
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:32,483
Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing
that, because he's not my son!

1228
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,584
Orderly!

1229
01:17:33,661 --> 01:17:35,060
He's not my son!
Orderly!

1230
01:17:35,129 --> 01:17:36,528
My son is missing!

1231
01:17:36,597 --> 01:17:39,088
The patient is becoming
hysterical! No! My son is missing!

1232
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,428
See to it she is
sedated properly.

1233
01:17:40,501 --> 01:17:42,492
Get her out of here.
No! No! No!

1234
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,969
Next!
No!

1235
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,499
No, no!
Orderly, hold on.

1236
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:51,203
Stop it!

1237
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:53,872
No! Open your mouth.
Open, open your mouth.

1238
01:17:53,981 --> 01:17:55,539
Easy!
You got her?

1239
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:57,174
God!
Swallow it.

1240
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:58,718
Stop it!

1241
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:01,446
Move back.

1242
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:02,955
You!
Get her out of here!

1243
01:18:03,024 --> 01:18:04,286
Come on, you got her?

1244
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:06,758
Stay out of this! This is none of
your business! This is police business!

1245
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:09,387
All of you! You'll stay out of it
if you know what's good for you!

1246
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:11,727
You'd think you were in enough
trouble with the law already,

1247
01:18:11,799 --> 01:18:13,198
being a whore,
wouldn't you?

1248
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,671
Attacking a staff member.
Room 18.

1249
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:22,266
No, no! Stop it! No!

1250
01:18:22,576 --> 01:18:24,510
No! No!

1251
01:18:25,846 --> 01:18:27,438
No! Stop it!

1252
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:41,713
Come on, kid.

1253
01:20:01,442 --> 01:20:05,276
I don't know. I'm not sure. I
think so. He was pretty close.

1254
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:06,643
Excuse me.

1255
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:09,314
It's all right, I can take
it from here. But I got...

1256
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:10,407
We need him
for questioning.

1257
01:20:10,484 --> 01:20:11,542
Like I said,
it was dark.

1258
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:12,881
Thanks. Come on.

1259
01:20:13,654 --> 01:20:15,053
Brady, Ross.

1260
01:20:15,122 --> 01:20:17,215
You've just been requisitioned for
backup. I'll explain on the way.

1261
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,815
Yes, sir.

1262
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,036
I'm not sure. She said she'd had the
croup before. This could be pneumonia.

1263
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:35,140
I keep telling her that,
and she doesn't want to.

1264
01:20:35,276 --> 01:20:36,641
You have to insist.

1265
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,177
You shouldn't
have done that.

1266
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:39,610
Please, let me out!
Get in there!

1267
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,011
Wanted to.

1268
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:42,946
Felt good.

1269
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:44,709
Let me out! No! Please! No! You got her?

1270
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:50,622
I lost two babies
to back alley doctors.

1271
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,023
No choice.

1272
01:20:56,397 --> 01:20:59,195
Never had the chance
to fight for them.

1273
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:01,798
You do.

1274
01:21:02,336 --> 01:21:03,701
Don't stop.

1275
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:06,534
I won't.

1276
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:14,878
Fuck them and the horse
they rode in on.

1277
01:21:17,852 --> 01:21:20,116
That's not exactly
language for a lady.

1278
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:22,247
Hell.

1279
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:27,024
There are times that's exactly
the right language to use.

1280
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:29,521
Yeah?

1281
01:21:31,098 --> 01:21:33,623
When you've got
nothing left to lose.

1282
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:36,531
You're not supposed
to be here!

1283
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:38,298
Mmm. Mmm.

1284
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:04,222
Stay there. Check the
house. Check the barn.

1285
01:22:13,908 --> 01:22:15,671
It's all clear.

1286
01:22:15,776 --> 01:22:17,607
Clear here.

1287
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:19,612
Bring me that shovel.

1288
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,682
All right. Let's go.

1289
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:32,219
Come on.

1290
01:22:35,396 --> 01:22:37,591
You're gonna show me.

1291
01:22:43,404 --> 01:22:45,099
Come on. Show me.

1292
01:23:06,226 --> 01:23:07,454
This it?

1293
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:10,293
You sure?

1294
01:23:10,364 --> 01:23:11,456
Yeah.

1295
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:15,459
Dig.

1296
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:22,241
You put them in the ground, you
can take them out of the ground.

1297
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:24,974
Go on. Dig.

1298
01:23:25,879 --> 01:23:28,040
You heard me. Dig.

1299
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:14,624
My God.

1300
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,297
Oh, my God.

1301
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:33,210
Call it in.

1302
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:34,839
Get the coroner
and every officer

1303
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:37,110
in a 20-mile radius here
inside the hour.

1304
01:24:37,184 --> 01:24:40,483
Then put out an APB on
Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1305
01:24:41,622 --> 01:24:44,147
The information's
in my car. Go on.

1306
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:51,391
You can stop, son.

1307
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,235
You can stop now.
It's over.

1308
01:24:58,305 --> 01:24:59,567
Hey.

1309
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,872
We'll take it, we can take it
from here. We can take it from...

1310
01:25:09,216 --> 01:25:12,674
We can take it from
here, okay? It's over.

1311
01:25:18,392 --> 01:25:20,053
It's okay.

1312
01:25:22,663 --> 01:25:24,358
It's okay. It's okay.

1313
01:25:24,965 --> 01:25:26,262
It's all over.

1314
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,792
Okay?

1315
01:25:29,903 --> 01:25:31,029
File.

1316
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:37,967
Privacy, please.

1317
01:25:43,717 --> 01:25:47,175
I see that you've been refusing
medication, requiring force feeding.

1318
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:49,489
All right, Michael.
Lunchtime?

1319
01:25:49,556 --> 01:25:52,650
Six days, Mrs. Collins,
and no progress.

1320
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,987
We may have to move on to
more strenuous therapies.

1321
01:25:58,098 --> 01:26:01,727
Unless you're willing to
prove that you're doing better

1322
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,899
by signing this.

1323
01:26:07,975 --> 01:26:10,808
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on.

1324
01:26:15,215 --> 01:26:16,739
Room 18.

1325
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:28,220
I want to talk to somebody
in charge, right now!

1326
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:29,557
Please.

1327
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,655
Who is in charge here?

1328
01:26:33,867 --> 01:26:35,027
Open.

1329
01:26:35,602 --> 01:26:36,899
I'm the head doctor on duty.

1330
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:39,234
You're the doctor who
locked up Christine Collins?

1331
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:40,432
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

1332
01:26:40,507 --> 01:26:42,031
We don't discuss cases with
anyone other than family.

1333
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:44,703
Oh, you'll damn well
discuss this one. Read it.

1334
01:26:44,778 --> 01:26:45,802
Sir.

1335
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:47,107
Read it.

1336
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:54,011
Stop.

1337
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:03,894
Mrs. Collins,
one last time.

1338
01:27:03,964 --> 01:27:07,491
Are you or are you not
prepared to sign that letter?

1339
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:08,796
No.

1340
01:27:13,006 --> 01:27:14,564
You're free to leave.

1341
01:27:17,978 --> 01:27:19,070
What?

1342
01:27:19,446 --> 01:27:22,938
Your clothes are in the next
room. You can change there.

1343
01:27:23,684 --> 01:27:24,708
In the next room?

1344
01:27:24,785 --> 01:27:26,412
Yes. That's right.

1345
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:28,751
See to it.

1346
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:34,954
Christ.

1347
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:36,486
Long as
it's not the original.

1348
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:37,621
No, it's not.

1349
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,097
Here it is.

1350
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,997
And who is that? Is that
Baker's file or Larson?

1351
01:27:41,068 --> 01:27:42,296
That's Baker.

1352
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:44,234
He said he wanted...

1353
01:27:44,304 --> 01:27:45,703
Nurse, I wanna see

1354
01:27:45,772 --> 01:27:48,900
every piece of paper you have on
the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

1355
01:27:48,976 --> 01:27:50,967
and I want to see it right
now, do you understand me?

1356
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:53,672
Every piece. When
will she be coming out?

1357
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:55,739
Oh, it's just up ahead.

1358
01:27:55,816 --> 01:27:57,113
Oh, all right.
Let's...

1359
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,414
Hurricane hits
West Palm Beach!

1360
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:01,954
Babe Ruth hits
53rd home run!

1361
01:28:02,923 --> 01:28:04,914
Kids found murdered in
Riverside! There it is.

1362
01:28:04,992 --> 01:28:07,859
Biggest crime
in Los Angeles history!

1363
01:28:07,928 --> 01:28:09,987
Collins boy assumed dead!

1364
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:13,689
Read it here!
Read it here!

1365
01:28:19,006 --> 01:28:21,099
Mrs. Collins,
I'm so sorry.

1366
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:27,809
Captain, your handling of
the Christine Collins case

1367
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,941
has exposed this department
to public ridicule.

1368
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:35,351
There is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability.

1369
01:28:35,822 --> 01:28:38,689
Sir, nobody could've known what
was happening up at that ranch.

1370
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:41,819
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

1371
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:43,988
And as for the
Collins woman,

1372
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:46,828
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

1373
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:48,059
No?

1374
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:49,102
No.

1375
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:52,661
There were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him.

1376
01:28:52,739 --> 01:28:54,673
The Clark kid
could've been mistaken.

1377
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:56,072
Maybe he was.

1378
01:28:56,143 --> 01:28:59,374
Which begs the obvious
question. Who cares?

1379
01:29:00,781 --> 01:29:01,873
Sir?

1380
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:04,310
The mayor wants
this to go away.

1381
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:06,477
I want this to go away.

1382
01:29:06,553 --> 01:29:10,045
The way you do that is to stop
insisting that Walter Collins

1383
01:29:10,123 --> 01:29:12,648
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch.

1384
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:15,286
Because if the boy you brought
back is not Walter Collins,

1385
01:29:15,362 --> 01:29:18,354
and he's not dead up at that
ranch, then where the hell is he?

1386
01:29:18,432 --> 01:29:20,127
People are gonna want to
know why we haven't found him.

1387
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,464
Why we're not
doing our job.

1388
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,263
But if, on the other hand,

1389
01:29:25,339 --> 01:29:29,605
he is, or could be, among those
poor boys killed up in Wineville,

1390
01:29:30,077 --> 01:29:32,409
then the inquiries stop.

1391
01:29:34,147 --> 01:29:35,705
It's a momentary
embarrassment

1392
01:29:35,782 --> 01:29:37,909
you're just gonna
have to live with.

1393
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:39,451
Better a short
inconvenience

1394
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:42,682
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1395
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:43,916
Yes, sir.

1396
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:45,855
The boy's been gone
nearly a year.

1397
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:49,089
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

1398
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:50,527
Whether he was up
at that ranch or not,

1399
01:29:50,597 --> 01:29:52,792
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere.

1400
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:56,927
Better his mother accept that
now than later, don't you think?

1401
01:29:57,003 --> 01:29:58,994
Yes, sir.
Good.

1402
01:29:59,072 --> 01:30:00,699
That'll be all, Captain.

1403
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:06,072
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

1404
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:07,940
Tell county jail we're
remanding him for trial.

1405
01:30:08,014 --> 01:30:11,882
Wait. I didn't do anything. I
wasn't even here when it happened.

1406
01:30:13,086 --> 01:30:14,417
By pretending to
be Walter Collins,

1407
01:30:14,488 --> 01:30:17,980
you're interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder.

1408
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:21,050
We can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact.

1409
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:22,561
That's too bad.

1410
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:26,360
County jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home.

1411
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:27,832
It's a lot worse.

1412
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:32,327
You can't do that.
I'm just a kid.

1413
01:30:34,841 --> 01:30:36,866
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.

1414
01:30:36,943 --> 01:30:39,411
Fifteen.
He's going to jail.

1415
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,677
All murderers and their accomplices
go to jail. Everybody knows that.

1416
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:48,582
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

1417
01:30:48,655 --> 01:30:51,180
Wait. I don't
want to go to jail.

1418
01:31:01,435 --> 01:31:02,697
Prove it.

1419
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:05,668
I...

1420
01:31:05,806 --> 01:31:09,333
I knew Los Angeles is where
they make the Tom Mix movies.

1421
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:11,910
I figured
if I could meet Tom Mix

1422
01:31:11,978 --> 01:31:14,674
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse.

1423
01:31:16,216 --> 01:31:18,776
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

1424
01:31:23,089 --> 01:31:24,488
How are you feeling?

1425
01:31:24,558 --> 01:31:25,923
All right.

1426
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,389
The police still
have a car outside.

1427
01:31:28,462 --> 01:31:32,330
I guess they're waiting to see
what your next move is going to be.

1428
01:31:33,467 --> 01:31:35,492
I'm going home.
And then?

1429
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:37,903
Then, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1430
01:31:37,971 --> 01:31:42,465
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

1431
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:47,006
I used to always tell him, "You never
start a fight, but you always finish it. "

1432
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,481
And I didn't start this
fight, but I'm gonna finish it.

1433
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:55,282
Mrs. Collins, right now you're a
sufficiently high profile that I think

1434
01:31:55,355 --> 01:31:59,189
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open,

1435
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:02,059
but I have to warn you that
could change very quickly

1436
01:32:02,128 --> 01:32:04,824
if they feel their
position threatened.

1437
01:32:04,898 --> 01:32:06,695
Very quickly indeed.

1438
01:32:08,068 --> 01:32:10,400
What are they gonna
do to me now?

1439
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:13,932
They got nothing.

1440
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:18,467
I'm going home.

1441
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:43,601
Hi, sis.

1442
01:32:44,337 --> 01:32:45,668
Gordon.

1443
01:32:45,739 --> 01:32:48,230
I didn't know
you were back in town.

1444
01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:51,070
Yeah, I got in
a couple of days ago,

1445
01:32:51,144 --> 01:32:54,011
figured I'd surprise you.
Is that... Is that okay?

1446
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,106
Yes. Yes, of course.
Of course, come on in.

1447
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,318
Where's that
little niece of mine?

1448
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:04,516
She went into town.

1449
01:33:04,591 --> 01:33:06,081
Should be back this evening.

1450
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,353
Uh, Bob's here.

1451
01:33:07,427 --> 01:33:08,485
Oh, good.

1452
01:33:08,562 --> 01:33:10,894
Uh, I was gonna ask if I
could stay on a couple days.

1453
01:33:10,964 --> 01:33:12,329
Staying?

1454
01:33:12,732 --> 01:33:13,858
Yeah.

1455
01:33:13,934 --> 01:33:16,198
Listen, can I use
your bathroom?

1456
01:33:16,269 --> 01:33:18,260
It's been a long ride and
I could really use a shower.

1457
01:33:18,338 --> 01:33:20,272
Of course.
Okay.

1458
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,406
Thank you.

1459
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,018
Is that...

1460
01:33:38,224 --> 01:33:41,591
All right, go next door.
I'll call the police. Hurry.

1461
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:48,061
<i>Operator.
How may I connect you?</i>

1462
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:49,693
He's upstairs, sir.

1463
01:33:49,769 --> 01:33:52,533
Go around the other side!
Cut him off!

1464
01:33:52,606 --> 01:33:53,664
Come with me!
Yes, sir.

1465
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,037
Let's go!

1466
01:33:59,212 --> 01:34:03,080
Mrs. Collins, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

1467
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:06,778
Mrs. Collins, my deepest
condolences on your loss.

1468
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,012
May we come in?

1469
01:34:13,126 --> 01:34:15,026
I appreciate the sentiment,

1470
01:34:15,095 --> 01:34:17,325
but they've yet to find...

1471
01:34:17,397 --> 01:34:19,922
To identify the
remains as my son.

1472
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:24,593
I'm afraid it never
gets any easier.

1473
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:27,332
I lost a daughter
to polio five years ago.

1474
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:29,602
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think,

1475
01:34:29,676 --> 01:34:32,201
"I should mention
this to Claudine. "

1476
01:34:32,278 --> 01:34:34,644
Then I remember
she's not here.

1477
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:38,814
Please, sit.

1478
01:34:43,757 --> 01:34:45,691
I've been on the phone
all morning

1479
01:34:45,759 --> 01:34:48,956
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

1480
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:50,997
They said that they won't let me testify

1481
01:34:51,064 --> 01:34:54,329
at the hearing or call witnesses.
That it won't be necessary.

1482
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:56,995
I know. My sources say
the police commission

1483
01:34:57,070 --> 01:35:01,166
is going to say that Jones and the
LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,

1484
01:35:01,274 --> 01:35:04,334
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

1485
01:35:04,411 --> 01:35:09,348
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

1486
01:35:12,686 --> 01:35:16,850
Then I guess I would have to
hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.

1487
01:35:17,657 --> 01:35:19,591
I went to the best
attorney in town,

1488
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:22,492
a man who's sued this
city four times and won.

1489
01:35:22,562 --> 01:35:25,531
Unfortunately, we can't
afford to really hire him.

1490
01:35:25,598 --> 01:35:26,826
I see.

1491
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,391
Which is why
I'm doing this pro bono.

1492
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:33,269
It would be my honor to defend
your honor, Mrs. Collins.

1493
01:35:33,473 --> 01:35:34,838
In my 15 years as a lawyer,

1494
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:38,708
I have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have,

1495
01:35:38,945 --> 01:35:42,108
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice.

1496
01:35:42,882 --> 01:35:44,247
Thank you.

1497
01:35:44,818 --> 01:35:46,183
Let me see
what's on the shelf.

1498
01:35:46,252 --> 01:35:47,583
I'll look.

1499
01:35:49,656 --> 01:35:50,748
Yes? May I...

1500
01:35:50,824 --> 01:35:52,155
My name is S.S. Hahn,

1501
01:35:52,225 --> 01:35:55,058
and I have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained

1502
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:58,063
in this institution under
the designation code 12

1503
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:01,362
pending a formal inquiry into
the reasons for their detainment.

1504
01:36:01,434 --> 01:36:03,595
I'm sorry, the doctor
in charge is not here

1505
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,194
until the morning.
Madam, let me be clearer.

1506
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:08,035
Either you will produce the
people named in that court order,

1507
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:11,669
or you will find yourself behind
bars, and I mean without a key.

1508
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:14,873
I can't authorize you...
Madam, stand aside.

1509
01:36:24,858 --> 01:36:25,916
Can I see her now?

1510
01:36:25,992 --> 01:36:28,017
Sure. Absolutely.
How does she look?

1511
01:36:53,653 --> 01:36:55,621
All right, fellas, step
back. Let's give him room.

1512
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:56,712
Here he is.

1513
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,781
Mr. Northcott,
any comment on your arrest?

1514
01:36:58,858 --> 01:37:00,018
Mr. Northcott,
how are you feeling?

1515
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:01,754
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

1516
01:37:01,828 --> 01:37:04,353
I've been on a little
vacation, as some of you know.

1517
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:07,126
It was
a really pleasant vacation.

1518
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:10,431
The police have certainly provided
me with a lot of amusement.

1519
01:37:10,503 --> 01:37:11,936
How long
you been in hiding?

1520
01:37:12,005 --> 01:37:13,267
How did you
avoid capture?

1521
01:37:13,339 --> 01:37:14,601
Easy, easy.
That's far enough.

1522
01:37:14,674 --> 01:37:16,369
Well, I didn't, did I?

1523
01:37:16,442 --> 01:37:17,534
One more shot!

1524
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,578
Have you seen
your picture in the paper?

1525
01:37:19,646 --> 01:37:22,877
Didn't know anybody wanted
me until just recently.

1526
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:24,541
Didn't even try.

1527
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:28,211
My luggage still has
my initials on it, fellas.

1528
01:37:28,288 --> 01:37:30,415
Did you know why
the police were after you?

1529
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:33,391
No, but I figured it'd be a good
idea if I were to just stay out of it.

1530
01:37:33,459 --> 01:37:34,483
Any remorse, sir?

1531
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:39,260
Do you have anything to say to the
parents of the children you murdered?

1532
01:37:39,332 --> 01:37:41,027
No comment.

1533
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,192
One more shot,
this way!

1534
01:37:43,803 --> 01:37:46,465
Mayor Cryer.
This is unexpected.

1535
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,864
So was this.

1536
01:37:48,942 --> 01:37:52,378
Subpoenas, requests for
depositions, interrogatories.

1537
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:56,040
All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his
new client, Christine Collins.

1538
01:37:56,983 --> 01:37:58,541
You don't have to look them
over too closely, Chief.

1539
01:37:58,618 --> 01:38:01,382
Your own copies should
be coming any time now.

1540
01:38:01,454 --> 01:38:03,888
The city council has also
agreed to look into this,

1541
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:05,015
starting immediately.

1542
01:38:05,091 --> 01:38:06,149
God damn it!

1543
01:38:06,226 --> 01:38:08,956
I thought this was
supposed to go away.

1544
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:10,824
This is an election year.

1545
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:12,387
I can't afford
this kind of press.

1546
01:38:12,465 --> 01:38:15,696
It is going away, sir. I've instructed
Captain Jones to deal with it.

1547
01:38:15,768 --> 01:38:17,326
I'm afraid,
falling on his sword

1548
01:38:17,403 --> 01:38:21,305
and saying he made a mistake isn't
going to be good enough, Chief.

1549
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:24,832
If we take him out of
the picture for a while,

1550
01:38:24,911 --> 01:38:28,711
just might help calm things down
until the hearing's finished.

1551
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:48,664
What is happening?
Didn't you hear?

1552
01:38:48,735 --> 01:38:50,498
It's the biggest protest
I've ever seen.

1553
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:51,832
Protest?
Yeah.

1554
01:38:51,905 --> 01:38:55,102
Over the Collins broad,
if you can believe that.

1555
01:39:04,684 --> 01:39:07,847
We want justice!
We want justice!

1556
01:39:10,256 --> 01:39:11,848
Oh, my!

1557
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:20,299
Mr. Harris.

1558
01:39:20,366 --> 01:39:23,665
The Lord works in mysterious
ways, Mrs. Collins.

1559
01:39:24,904 --> 01:39:26,769
Boy, does he ever.

1560
01:39:44,057 --> 01:39:46,651
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?</i>

1561
01:39:46,726 --> 01:39:51,288
There are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before.

1562
01:39:51,364 --> 01:39:55,061
Therefore, I ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind.

1563
01:39:55,134 --> 01:39:56,624
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth!

1564
01:39:56,703 --> 01:40:00,605
We are all here because we want to
know the real facts in this case.

1565
01:40:00,673 --> 01:40:04,803
And everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.

1566
01:40:04,877 --> 01:40:07,778
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any
members of the police commission.

1567
01:40:11,284 --> 01:40:14,447
Are there any members of the
police department in the room?

1568
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,385
Is Chief Davis here?

1569
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:19,382
Is Captain Jones here?

1570
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,559
Is there anybody here
representing the police?

1571
01:40:22,628 --> 01:40:26,826
Mrs. Collins, could you come across
the street with me for just a moment?

1572
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:29,094
There's something
I think you should see.

1573
01:40:29,168 --> 01:40:31,193
Well, I hate to call a recess
before we've even started,

1574
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:32,794
but I think a few
phone calls are in order.

1575
01:40:37,043 --> 01:40:39,944
The police decided it'd be best
to keep this off the main docket

1576
01:40:40,046 --> 01:40:44,278
in order to avoid exactly the sort
of chaos we have across the street.

1577
01:40:56,929 --> 01:40:59,898
Mrs. Collins.
I'm Leanne Clay.

1578
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,964
This is my husband, John.
Hi.

1579
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,896
I just wanted to pass
along my sympathies.

1580
01:41:07,173 --> 01:41:09,300
What we went through
waiting to hear anything

1581
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:13,505
about our son David
was bad enough, now this.

1582
01:41:14,447 --> 01:41:18,406
But what the police did to
you, there was no call for that.

1583
01:41:18,484 --> 01:41:20,042
No call at all.

1584
01:41:23,056 --> 01:41:24,614
All rise.

1585
01:41:33,366 --> 01:41:35,391
Please, be seated.
Bailiff.

1586
01:41:48,648 --> 01:41:49,842
Oh, hey.

1587
01:41:52,051 --> 01:41:54,178
I saw you in the papers.

1588
01:41:54,253 --> 01:41:58,121
You got a lot of moxie, standing
up to the police like that.

1589
01:42:03,329 --> 01:42:05,263
The defendant
will please rise.

1590
01:42:10,903 --> 01:42:12,996
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1591
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:17,236
you've been charged with three
counts of murder in the first degree,

1592
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:22,009
with an additional 17 counts under
review by the district attorney's office.

1593
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:23,708
How do you plea?

1594
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:27,245
Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.

1595
01:42:31,023 --> 01:42:33,184
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.

1596
01:42:37,763 --> 01:42:42,700
In light of the defendant's penchant for
international travel, no bail will be set.

1597
01:42:42,768 --> 01:42:45,362
This court will hear preliminary
motions by tomorrow morning.

1598
01:42:45,438 --> 01:42:47,906
The boy,
Walter Collins,

1599
01:42:47,974 --> 01:42:50,738
was reported as missing,
March 10, 1928.

1600
01:42:51,544 --> 01:42:54,172
We then instituted
a nationwide search.

1601
01:42:54,247 --> 01:42:58,183
On August 18th, we received
a cable indicating that a boy

1602
01:42:58,251 --> 01:43:01,687
matching his description was
found in DeKalb, Illinois.

1603
01:43:01,754 --> 01:43:05,781
Upon questioning, he admitted
to being Walter Collins.

1604
01:43:05,858 --> 01:43:10,818
We then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to California.

1605
01:43:11,063 --> 01:43:13,531
Where Mrs. Collins told you
the boy was not her son.

1606
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:15,362
Yes. She denied
his identity

1607
01:43:15,434 --> 01:43:18,426
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary.

1608
01:43:18,504 --> 01:43:21,598
But, as subsequent
events have demonstrated,

1609
01:43:21,707 --> 01:43:23,368
she was correct.

1610
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:26,475
So, what prompted
you to send her

1611
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:28,173
for psychological
evaluation?

1612
01:43:28,247 --> 01:43:29,976
Whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy

1613
01:43:30,049 --> 01:43:32,574
was not relevant
to my decision.

1614
01:43:32,652 --> 01:43:34,813
Throughout this period,
she acted strangely.

1615
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:38,414
She was often cool
and aloof and unemotional,

1616
01:43:38,491 --> 01:43:42,154
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in DeKalb

1617
01:43:42,228 --> 01:43:44,287
and in our
subsequent conversation.

1618
01:43:44,363 --> 01:43:46,228
It was because of her

1619
01:43:47,033 --> 01:43:51,732
disturbing behavior that I
submitted her for observation

1620
01:43:51,804 --> 01:43:54,602
to the psychopathic ward of Los
Angeles County General Hospital.

1621
01:43:54,674 --> 01:43:55,971
Just like that.

1622
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:58,237
You snap your fingers
and an innocent woman

1623
01:43:58,311 --> 01:44:00,006
is thrown
into the psycho ward!

1624
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,412
She wasn't thrown. Every family
in this state is in grave danger

1625
01:44:03,482 --> 01:44:06,610
when a police captain can
take a woman into his office

1626
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,016
and five minutes later

1627
01:44:08,087 --> 01:44:10,817
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority!

1628
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:12,289
She wasn't thrown.

1629
01:44:12,358 --> 01:44:15,691
She wasn't thrown!
She wasn't thrown!

1630
01:44:16,362 --> 01:44:18,262
What was that, Captain?

1631
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:21,059
She wasn't thrown.
She was escorted.

1632
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:28,331
Escorted, thrown, the verb
doesn't matter, Captain.

1633
01:44:28,407 --> 01:44:32,639
What does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant.

1634
01:44:32,712 --> 01:44:34,646
I am holding a carbon copy

1635
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:37,842
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case

1636
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:41,353
<i>of the State of California
v. Christine Collins.</i>

1637
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,887
Who signed the affidavit?

1638
01:44:42,955 --> 01:44:44,047
I did.

1639
01:44:44,123 --> 01:44:46,751
Well, now, let me see
if I have this correct,

1640
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:50,421
a woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant,

1641
01:44:50,496 --> 01:44:52,657
because no warrant existed.

1642
01:44:52,732 --> 01:44:55,292
And when it was finally
written several days later,

1643
01:44:55,368 --> 01:44:57,734
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge

1644
01:44:57,803 --> 01:45:00,567
because she was already
in the asylum!

1645
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:03,333
Is this correct, Captain?

1646
01:45:03,409 --> 01:45:04,671
Technically, yes.

1647
01:45:04,744 --> 01:45:07,770
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing...

1648
01:45:07,847 --> 01:45:09,678
We were dealing with
an extraordinary situation.

1649
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:12,445
Now, is it our fault
that we were being deceived

1650
01:45:12,518 --> 01:45:15,316
by a boy who claimed to
be Walter Collins? No.

1651
01:45:16,088 --> 01:45:19,080
In light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior,

1652
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:21,752
who wouldn't begin to think that there
was something the matter with her?

1653
01:45:21,827 --> 01:45:22,851
Because she questioned you?

1654
01:45:22,928 --> 01:45:25,123
No, because
she wouldn't listen!

1655
01:45:25,197 --> 01:45:26,994
Because she insisted
on being obstinate!

1656
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:30,263
Because she tried to take
matters into her own hand,

1657
01:45:30,369 --> 01:45:32,132
best left to
qualified officers!

1658
01:45:32,204 --> 01:45:33,899
Because once
civil disobedience starts...

1659
01:45:33,973 --> 01:45:36,032
Because she was fighting
for the life of her son!

1660
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:38,099
A boy who may have
still been alive

1661
01:45:38,177 --> 01:45:42,841
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong!

1662
01:45:45,584 --> 01:45:47,142
And in the end

1663
01:45:48,654 --> 01:45:51,384
that's what
happened, isn't it?

1664
01:45:51,490 --> 01:45:54,948
At some point, while
all this was going on,

1665
01:45:57,129 --> 01:45:59,791
Walter Collins
was brutally murdered,

1666
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:03,166
along with as many
as 19 other boys

1667
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:07,632
at the Northcott Ranch
in Wineville.

1668
01:46:09,442 --> 01:46:11,603
Is that correct, Captain?

1669
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:14,735
Yes, it is.

1670
01:46:15,481 --> 01:46:17,108
It's a travesty.

1671
01:46:22,788 --> 01:46:24,619
No further questions.

1672
01:46:42,007 --> 01:46:43,998
<i>Train number 14,
now boarding on track...</i>

1673
01:46:44,076 --> 01:46:47,944
So, after much effort, we
were able to identify this boy,

1674
01:46:48,013 --> 01:46:50,573
who's been responsible
for so much trouble lately,

1675
01:46:50,649 --> 01:46:53,516
as Arthur Hutchins
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1676
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,585
Between this, and the arrest of
the man suspected of murdering

1677
01:46:57,656 --> 01:46:59,385
the real Walter Collins,

1678
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:02,723
we've cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.

1679
01:47:02,795 --> 01:47:04,990
I hope you gentlemen
of the press will give

1680
01:47:05,064 --> 01:47:07,123
as much space to the
good things we do

1681
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,759
as the mistakes that are
made on rare occasions.

1682
01:47:09,835 --> 01:47:11,666
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce you

1683
01:47:11,737 --> 01:47:14,797
to the boy's real mother,
Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

1684
01:47:16,242 --> 01:47:17,709
Arthur.

1685
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:19,300
I hope he wasn't too
much trouble for you.

1686
01:47:19,378 --> 01:47:21,175
Oh, no, not at all.

1687
01:47:21,247 --> 01:47:23,442
How about
a photograph, fellas?

1688
01:47:26,519 --> 01:47:27,918
One more.

1689
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:29,920
Mrs. Hutchins,

1690
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:33,322
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was
staying with, wanted him to have these.

1691
01:47:33,392 --> 01:47:34,882
They're the clothes
she let him wear.

1692
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,757
Well, thank you.

1693
01:47:36,829 --> 01:47:38,592
Isn't that nice, Arthur?

1694
01:47:38,664 --> 01:47:41,030
Tell the nice officer,
"Thank you. "

1695
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:44,092
I don't want them.
Give them to somebody else.

1696
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,797
Precocious
little fellow, isn't he?

1697
01:47:45,871 --> 01:47:48,169
It's not my fault.
It's the police.

1698
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,869
They said I was Walter Collins,
not me! It wasn't my idea!

1699
01:47:51,944 --> 01:47:53,411
Not my idea!
Get...

1700
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:55,913
Yeah. Go blame the police
for your own mistakes.

1701
01:47:55,981 --> 01:47:58,142
We've seen a lot of
that lately, haven't we?

1702
01:47:58,217 --> 01:48:01,152
Take care now, Arthur!
Safe travels.

1703
01:48:02,321 --> 01:48:04,551
All right, fellas,
that's it for today.

1704
01:48:04,623 --> 01:48:06,352
Sir, sir! What did the boy mean by that?

1705
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:10,152
It was March 10th, and
I came home from work,

1706
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:13,096
and my nine-year-old
son, Walter, was gone.

1707
01:48:13,165 --> 01:48:16,896
Captain Jones was acting on
information he believed to be correct.

1708
01:48:16,969 --> 01:48:20,598
Walter Collins had a diastema,
also known as a diastema.

1709
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:22,197
That child was never
in my classroom.

1710
01:48:22,308 --> 01:48:23,832
I can certainly
attest to that.

1711
01:48:23,909 --> 01:48:27,276
We rely on our good friends
in the police department

1712
01:48:27,346 --> 01:48:30,406
to point to us those
people who exhibit behavior

1713
01:48:30,483 --> 01:48:33,213
which is socially
unacceptable.

1714
01:48:33,285 --> 01:48:38,120
About four inches shorter
than the last mark of Walter.

1715
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:41,516
Well, some of
these pictures show

1716
01:48:41,594 --> 01:48:44,256
what Sanford Clark
told me,

1717
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,925
that he did in fact help in
the murder of these children.

1718
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,695
Thank you, Detective.

1719
01:48:49,768 --> 01:48:50,996
Gentlemen of the jury,

1720
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:53,834
I ask you to take a good
look at these images.

1721
01:48:53,906 --> 01:48:56,466
They establish beyond
any reasonable doubt

1722
01:48:56,542 --> 01:49:00,308
the circumstances and the
nature of these heinous crimes.

1723
01:49:11,557 --> 01:49:13,422
I'm in here,
Reverend.

1724
01:49:21,534 --> 01:49:23,661
When Walter was here, I
used to walk by his room

1725
01:49:23,736 --> 01:49:25,897
when he was sleeping.

1726
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:29,964
And even though I couldn't
see him or hear him,

1727
01:49:30,042 --> 01:49:31,771
I could feel him.

1728
01:49:34,013 --> 01:49:36,743
That's why I don't
think Walter's dead.

1729
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,880
I can still feel him.

1730
01:49:42,521 --> 01:49:44,489
Mrs. Collins...
No.

1731
01:49:44,557 --> 01:49:46,752
I know what
the police said.

1732
01:49:47,259 --> 01:49:49,819
But that place
and the remains,

1733
01:49:51,697 --> 01:49:54,222
they couldn't be
properly identified.

1734
01:49:55,234 --> 01:49:59,568
And maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked Walter's picture.

1735
01:50:00,439 --> 01:50:03,840
I understand you don't
want to accept this.

1736
01:50:03,909 --> 01:50:05,570
What mother would?

1737
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:12,373
But I think it's time
for you to move on

1738
01:50:12,484 --> 01:50:14,850
and start over
for yourself.

1739
01:50:16,088 --> 01:50:18,522
Your son would
want you to move on.

1740
01:50:20,693 --> 01:50:22,923
Maybe.

1741
01:50:22,995 --> 01:50:26,294
Maybe he'd want me
to keep looking for him.

1742
01:50:26,365 --> 01:50:28,890
Maybe he's somewhere
waiting for me.

1743
01:50:30,769 --> 01:50:32,999
I believe he is
waiting, ma'am.

1744
01:50:34,506 --> 01:50:36,303
He's waiting in
that place where

1745
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:40,402
we'll all go someday to be
reunited with our loved ones.

1746
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:45,576
And on that day, he'll know
from front to back, end to end,

1747
01:50:45,651 --> 01:50:49,178
heart to soul, that you did
everything you could, Mrs. Collins.

1748
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:51,921
Everything.

1749
01:50:55,828 --> 01:50:57,523
We should go, ma'am.

1750
01:50:57,596 --> 01:50:58,961
One minute.

1751
01:51:25,858 --> 01:51:28,349
This meeting will
now come to order.

1752
01:51:29,361 --> 01:51:32,387
This committee has now
heard all of the testimony,

1753
01:51:32,464 --> 01:51:35,433
and, in light of
the facts presented,

1754
01:51:35,534 --> 01:51:38,367
we recommend that the
suspension of Captain Jones

1755
01:51:38,437 --> 01:51:39,904
be made permanent.

1756
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:47,803
Order! Please. Please.

1757
01:51:48,947 --> 01:51:50,938
Mr. Foreman,

1758
01:51:51,016 --> 01:51:53,507
has the jury
reached a verdict?

1759
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:55,348
We have, Your Honor.

1760
01:51:56,622 --> 01:51:58,852
Will the defendant
please rise?

1761
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:05,260
Second, that steps be taken
to investigate a change

1762
01:52:05,364 --> 01:52:08,458
in the prevailing laws and
procedures by which a citizen

1763
01:52:08,534 --> 01:52:11,992
of this city can be
subjected to incarceration

1764
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:14,130
in the county's
mental facilities.

1765
01:52:21,313 --> 01:52:23,304
You may read the verdict.

1766
01:52:24,016 --> 01:52:26,883
"We the jury find the defendant,
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1767
01:52:26,952 --> 01:52:29,512
"guilty on all counts of
murder in the first degree. "

1768
01:52:34,293 --> 01:52:38,559
Finally, restoration of public
confidence in the police department

1769
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:40,757
can only be achieved

1770
01:52:40,866 --> 01:52:44,097
by the removal of
its chief of police,

1771
01:52:44,203 --> 01:52:46,228
and this committee
so recommends.

1772
01:52:46,305 --> 01:52:47,533
This hearing
is concluded.

1773
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:12,660
Does the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment is passed?

1774
01:53:13,799 --> 01:53:16,563
I want to make
it real clear

1775
01:53:16,635 --> 01:53:20,071
that I never once got
a fair shake from you,

1776
01:53:20,139 --> 01:53:21,902
Your Honor,

1777
01:53:22,841 --> 01:53:25,309
or from this court.

1778
01:53:29,715 --> 01:53:32,878
The only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her.

1779
01:53:35,287 --> 01:53:38,347
'Cause she's the only one who
never badmouthed me to the press.

1780
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:39,856
She's the only one
who understands

1781
01:53:39,925 --> 01:53:41,449
what it is to be framed by the police

1782
01:53:41,527 --> 01:53:43,825
for something you didn't
do. All right, that's enough.

1783
01:53:43,896 --> 01:53:46,490
And then to just be
thrown in the hole,

1784
01:53:46,565 --> 01:53:49,557
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten

1785
01:53:49,635 --> 01:53:51,364
and fade away, isn't that right? Gordon!

1786
01:53:51,436 --> 01:53:52,562
Counsel!
Isn't it?

1787
01:53:52,638 --> 01:53:55,038
I never killed your boy,
Mrs. Collins.

1788
01:53:55,107 --> 01:53:56,870
Counsel, that's enough!
I would never do that.

1789
01:53:56,942 --> 01:53:58,000
I would never
hurt Walter.

1790
01:53:58,076 --> 01:53:59,100
Counsel, get control
of your client

1791
01:53:59,178 --> 01:54:00,236
or I'll have him
bound and gagged!

1792
01:54:00,312 --> 01:54:01,802
He's an angel.

1793
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,610
Come on, Gordon.
Get off of me!

1794
01:54:04,683 --> 01:54:06,173
Now get down.

1795
01:54:08,921 --> 01:54:11,014
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1796
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:14,956
it is the judgment
of this court

1797
01:54:15,027 --> 01:54:17,325
that you be conveyed
to San Quentin Prison,

1798
01:54:17,396 --> 01:54:20,695
where you'll be held in solitary
confinement for a period of two years,

1799
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:24,361
until October 2, 1930.

1800
01:54:25,437 --> 01:54:29,771
On that date, you will be
hanged by the neck until dead.

1801
01:54:32,644 --> 01:54:34,703
May God have
mercy on your soul.

1802
01:55:48,787 --> 01:55:50,277
Is it all right if I
have a 10-minute break?

1803
01:55:50,355 --> 01:55:51,652
Of course.

1804
01:55:54,226 --> 01:55:55,591
You know,

1805
01:55:56,695 --> 01:55:58,629
one of these days you might
actually consider taking

1806
01:55:58,697 --> 01:56:00,221
one of these
10-minute breaks.

1807
01:56:00,299 --> 01:56:02,062
It might be
good for you.

1808
01:56:02,134 --> 01:56:03,465
We'll see.

1809
01:56:06,305 --> 01:56:08,330
This is
Christine Collins.

1810
01:56:08,407 --> 01:56:10,341
I called yesterday.

1811
01:56:10,409 --> 01:56:13,003
I was wondering if you had a
chance to look through the files

1812
01:56:13,078 --> 01:56:16,741
and see if there was a match
to my son, Walter Collins.

1813
01:56:17,749 --> 01:56:19,341
I see.

1814
01:56:19,418 --> 01:56:20,680
Well, if it's all
right with you,

1815
01:56:20,752 --> 01:56:23,516
I'll call back in a
month. Thank you very much.

1816
01:56:23,588 --> 01:56:25,783
Mrs. Collins.
I was just...

1817
01:56:25,857 --> 01:56:27,256
Yes, I know.

1818
01:56:28,393 --> 01:56:31,260
In fact, that's why
I wanted to see you.

1819
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:33,161
It's about Walter.
We had a...

1820
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:36,963
Well, we received
a very strange telegram.

1821
01:56:37,869 --> 01:56:39,131
From who?

1822
01:56:39,204 --> 01:56:41,172
Gordon Northcott.

1823
01:56:41,239 --> 01:56:43,139
He's asked to see you.

1824
01:56:43,675 --> 01:56:44,733
Why?

1825
01:56:45,811 --> 01:56:47,745
He said he knows you're
still looking for your son,

1826
01:56:47,813 --> 01:56:49,713
and before he dies...

1827
01:56:53,185 --> 01:56:56,586
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

1828
01:56:56,655 --> 01:57:00,250
Christine, he's willing to
finally admit that he did it.

1829
01:57:01,093 --> 01:57:03,561
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

1830
01:57:03,628 --> 01:57:06,153
then he'll tell you
the truth, to your face

1831
01:57:06,231 --> 01:57:08,756
so that you can get
on with your life

1832
01:57:09,868 --> 01:57:11,335
and have some peace.

1833
01:57:12,104 --> 01:57:13,628
<i>As you know, he's
set to be executed</i>

1834
01:57:13,705 --> 01:57:15,969
<i>the day after tomorrow
at San Quentin,</i>

1835
01:57:16,041 --> 01:57:19,204
<i>so you don't have
a lot of time.</i>

1836
01:57:20,212 --> 01:57:23,978
<i>It took me most of the morning
to make all the arrangements.</i>

1837
01:57:24,282 --> 01:57:26,113
<i>Turns out, you're the
first woman in 30 years</i>

1838
01:57:26,184 --> 01:57:29,119
<i>the state has allowed
to visit a serial killer</i>

1839
01:57:29,187 --> 01:57:31,280
<i>on the eve of
his execution.</i>

1840
01:57:51,977 --> 01:57:53,205
You'll be all
right, ma'am?

1841
01:57:53,278 --> 01:57:55,712
Yes. We're right at the door.

1842
01:57:58,817 --> 01:58:00,216
Twenty minutes.

1843
01:58:05,557 --> 01:58:07,923
Don't suppose you
got a cigarette?

1844
01:58:10,462 --> 01:58:13,363
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1845
01:58:13,565 --> 01:58:15,260
You said that
if I did,

1846
01:58:15,333 --> 01:58:18,029
you would tell me
the truth about my son.

1847
01:58:19,337 --> 01:58:20,736
Yeah.

1848
01:58:22,274 --> 01:58:24,902
You're right.
I did say that.

1849
01:58:24,976 --> 01:58:28,503
But see, the thing is,

1850
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:32,016
I didn't really think
that you would come.

1851
01:58:32,084 --> 01:58:33,449
And now.

1852
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:36,746
And now...
And now what?

1853
01:58:36,955 --> 01:58:39,253
I just didn't
expect that you'd...

1854
01:58:41,259 --> 01:58:43,227
I don't wanna see you.

1855
01:58:43,695 --> 01:58:45,754
You don't wanna see me?

1856
01:58:45,831 --> 01:58:48,299
No. See, I can't do this.

1857
01:58:48,366 --> 01:58:50,357
I don't wanna talk to you. I
can't talk to you right now,

1858
01:58:50,435 --> 01:58:52,426
not with what they're gonna
be doing to me tomorrow.

1859
01:58:52,504 --> 01:58:55,837
It's one thing, Mrs.
Collins, to send a telegram,

1860
01:58:55,907 --> 01:58:57,374
that is really easy.

1861
01:58:57,442 --> 01:59:01,936
But when it's here, right
now, in person, you know,

1862
01:59:02,013 --> 01:59:03,412
I just, I can't...

1863
01:59:03,482 --> 01:59:05,507
I can't tell you what you
want to hear, Mrs. Collins.

1864
01:59:05,584 --> 01:59:06,642
And why not?

1865
01:59:06,718 --> 01:59:10,347
Because I don't want to go
to hell with a lie on my lips.

1866
01:59:10,422 --> 01:59:12,515
See, I did my penance,

1867
01:59:12,591 --> 01:59:15,890
and I asked God to forgive me
and he did, so far as I know.

1868
01:59:15,961 --> 01:59:18,589
And I have been
really good ever since.

1869
01:59:18,663 --> 01:59:23,430
But if I lie now, if I
commit any sins right now,

1870
01:59:23,502 --> 01:59:25,402
I'm out of time here,

1871
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,869
and I won't be
forgiven again.

1872
01:59:26,938 --> 01:59:29,304
And I'll tell you one thing,
I am not going to hell.

1873
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:33,610
I'm not...

1874
01:59:40,519 --> 01:59:43,283
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1875
01:59:53,598 --> 01:59:54,929
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1876
01:59:56,835 --> 01:59:59,167
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1877
02:00:06,077 --> 02:00:07,840
Did you kill my son?

1878
02:00:12,684 --> 02:00:14,447
Did you kill my son?

1879
02:00:15,287 --> 02:00:16,754
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1880
02:00:16,821 --> 02:00:18,482
Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Hmm.

1881
02:00:18,557 --> 02:00:19,717
Did you kill my son?

1882
02:00:21,626 --> 02:00:24,527
I told you, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

1883
02:00:25,096 --> 02:00:29,190
Did you kill my son?

1884
02:00:29,267 --> 02:00:30,325
Did you kill my son?
Hmm.

1885
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,767
Did you kill my son?
I don't know.

1886
02:00:31,836 --> 02:00:33,030
You don't know?
You don't remember?

1887
02:00:33,104 --> 02:00:34,469
Did you kill my son?
Oh, no.

1888
02:00:34,539 --> 02:00:37,269
Answer me! You answer me! You answer me!

1889
02:00:37,342 --> 02:00:39,367
I don't know their names.
Did you kill my son? Yes...

1890
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:40,672
You better get off of me.

1891
02:00:40,745 --> 02:00:42,110
Or what?
Hmm.

1892
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,579
Did you kill my son?
I don't know.

1893
02:00:43,648 --> 02:00:44,842
Did you kill...

1894
02:00:44,916 --> 02:00:46,213
Did you kill my son?

1895
02:00:46,284 --> 02:00:47,546
You know his name!
Oh, I don't. No.

1896
02:00:47,619 --> 02:00:49,348
You know his name!
You called him an angel!

1897
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:51,446
No.
You know his name!

1898
02:00:51,523 --> 02:00:52,956
No, I don't know his
name. Did you kill my son?

1899
02:00:53,024 --> 02:00:54,992
They cried for their parents to
come and get them and then I...

1900
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:57,187
Did you kill my son?
Did you kill my son?

1901
02:00:57,262 --> 02:00:58,422
Answer me!
Or what?

1902
02:00:58,496 --> 02:00:59,827
Answer me!

1903
02:00:59,898 --> 02:01:01,763
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hurt me?

1904
02:01:01,833 --> 02:01:05,800
I hope you go to hell.

1905
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:07,531
Did you kill my son?
Guard! Hey, guard!

1906
02:01:07,606 --> 02:01:09,540
Did you kill my son?

1907
02:01:09,608 --> 02:01:11,439
Did you kill my son?
Ma'am, please.

1908
02:01:11,509 --> 02:01:13,602
Come on.
I hope you go to hell!

1909
02:01:13,678 --> 02:01:17,910
I hope you go to hell!
I hope you go to hell!

1910
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:20,508
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1911
02:01:22,621 --> 02:01:25,385
Did you kill my son?

1912
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:27,050
"Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1918

Do you have
any last words?

1919
02:02:47,272 --> 02:02:48,569
No.

1920
02:02:51,643 --> 02:02:52,871
Nothing.

1921

I kept clean after
I confessed, Reverend,

1922

just like I said I would.

1923
02:03:05,924 --> 02:03:08,188
Will it...

1924
02:03:08,259 --> 02:03:09,726
Will it hurt?

1925
02:03:16,968 --> 02:03:19,459
Please,
please, not so fast.

1926
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:23,639
Please, don't make
me walk so fast!

1927
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:27,977
Please,
don't make me!

1928
02:03:28,046 --> 02:03:30,344
No, I don't wanna.

1929
02:03:41,326 --> 02:03:44,159
No! Thirteen steps.

1930
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:47,823
Thirteen steps.

1931
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:50,766
But I didn't touch
them all, you bastards.

1932
02:03:50,835 --> 02:03:54,396
I didn't touch them all.
I didn't touch them all.

1933
02:03:55,407 --> 02:03:57,136
Please!

1934
02:04:02,647 --> 02:04:05,810
A prayer! Please!

1935
02:04:06,751 --> 02:04:08,480
God!

1936
02:04:09,521 --> 02:04:13,582
Please! Somebody
here, please,

1937
02:04:13,658 --> 02:04:16,821
say a prayer for me!

1938
02:04:16,895 --> 02:04:20,058
No, God. No!

1939
02:04:22,567 --> 02:04:24,592
No! No!

We're having
a party tonight

1947
02:05:59,564 --> 02:06:01,589
at my place for
the Academy show.

1948
02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:03,600
You want to come? No, I
have a million things to do.

1949
02:06:03,668 --> 02:06:05,226
Oh, come on,
please. Please!

1950
02:06:05,303 --> 02:06:07,999
You girls blew the phone lines
out from here to Baltimore.

1951
02:06:08,106 --> 02:06:09,334
Someone's gotta fix them.

1952
02:06:09,407 --> 02:06:10,999
Go, have a good night.
I have the radio.

1953
02:06:11,075 --> 02:06:12,633
Okay.

1954
02:06:13,711 --> 02:06:14,735
You sure?

1955
02:06:14,812 --> 02:06:15,836
I'm sure. I'm sure.
Have a good night.

1956
02:06:15,914 --> 02:06:17,677
Good night.
Good night.

1957
02:06:22,287 --> 02:06:24,255
Listen, I really...

1958
02:06:26,324 --> 02:06:27,689
Hello, Ben.

1959
02:06:29,594 --> 02:06:33,530
I'm meeting some friends at
Musso and Frank's for dinner.

1960
02:06:34,098 --> 02:06:37,829
They're gonna pipe in the movie
ceremonies into the restaurant.

1961
02:06:37,902 --> 02:06:40,029
Should be quite a night.

1962
02:06:40,104 --> 02:06:42,163
I'd love it if you'd come.

1963
02:06:43,575 --> 02:06:46,373
I just have so much
work I should be doing.

1964
02:06:48,413 --> 02:06:49,778
Good night.

1965
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:53,810
Ben?

1966
02:06:55,653 --> 02:06:56,881
I...

1967
02:06:56,955 --> 02:06:58,820
<i>I put $2 down on

1968

to win Best Picture.

1969
02:07:00,425 --> 02:07:02,052
Seems I am the only
person that thinks

1970
02:07:02,126 --> 02:07:03,991
<i>it has a chance
against Cleopatra.</i>

1971
02:07:04,062 --> 02:07:06,121
But, if it wins, do you wanna
celebrate tomorrow night at dinner?

1972
02:07:07,665 --> 02:07:10,259
It's a deal, Christine.
See you.

1973
02:07:10,335 --> 02:07:12,963
If your movie wins,
I'll call you.

1974
02:07:13,037 --> 02:07:14,504
I'll be here.

1975
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:19,770
Hi.
Hi.

1976
02:07:21,879 --> 02:07:25,110
<i>...The Thin Man, Cleopatra...</i>

1977
02:07:25,183 --> 02:07:26,810
Overrated.

02:07:26,884 --> 02:07:28,943
<i>...and It Happened One Night.</i>

1979
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:30,954
Clark Gable,

02:07:31,022 --> 02:07:32,421
I rest my case.

1981
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:34,924
<i>May I have the
envelope, please?</i>

1982
02:07:36,561 --> 02:07:40,292
<i>And the winner is
It Happened One Night.</i>

1983
02:07:42,166 --> 02:07:44,361
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

1984
02:07:46,437 --> 02:07:48,064
Dinner is on me.

1985
02:07:48,139 --> 02:07:50,004
<i>Is this
Christine Collins?</i>

1986
02:07:50,074 --> 02:07:52,235
Yes, it is.

1987
02:07:52,310 --> 02:07:54,904
<i>This is Mrs. Clay.
Do you remember me?</i>

1988
02:07:55,546 --> 02:07:57,844
Mrs. Clay,
of course I remember you.

1989
02:07:57,915 --> 02:07:59,974
<i>I just had to
call you right off.</i>

1990
02:08:00,051 --> 02:08:02,315
<i>What is it?
The police just called.</i>

1991
02:08:02,387 --> 02:08:04,582
<i>They found a boy,
Christine.</i>

1992
02:08:06,391 --> 02:08:08,518
<i>Where?
Lincoln Heights Precinct.</i>

1993
02:08:08,593 --> 02:08:10,060
<i>We're leaving right now.</i>

1994
02:08:10,128 --> 02:08:11,618
I'll be right down.

1995
02:08:34,318 --> 02:08:35,615
Oh, here.

1996
02:08:36,287 --> 02:08:37,652
I wanted to go
to him right off,

1997
02:08:37,722 --> 02:08:40,850
but they said it was important
to talk to him alone first.

1998
02:08:40,925 --> 02:08:43,052
Are they sure?
They're sure.

1999
02:08:43,127 --> 02:08:46,290
But, more important,
I'm sure.

2000
02:08:46,364 --> 02:08:47,456
It's my boy, all right.

2001
02:08:47,532 --> 02:08:49,363
It's David.

2002
02:08:49,434 --> 02:08:51,561
He's alive, Christine.

2003
02:08:51,636 --> 02:08:53,035
They found him
up in Hesperia.

2004
02:08:53,104 --> 02:08:56,096
<i>You were walking
home from school,</i>

2005
02:08:56,174 --> 02:08:58,369
<i>and they told you they
needed help finding a dog.</i>

2006
02:08:58,443 --> 02:08:59,705
<i>Yeah.</i>

2007
02:08:59,777 --> 02:09:02,837
<i>So, after you got in the
truck, what happened next?</i>

2008
02:09:02,914 --> 02:09:05,212
<i>They drove me around
for a long time,</i>

2009
02:09:05,283 --> 02:09:06,841
then we ended up
at this ranch.

2010
02:09:06,984 --> 02:09:10,385
Come on.
Come on, Davy.

2011
02:09:10,455 --> 02:09:11,820
Davy! Come on.
Get off me.

2012
02:09:11,889 --> 02:09:13,083
Don't fight
this much. Hey!

2013
02:09:13,157 --> 02:09:15,250
Were there other
boys there?

2014
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,428
<i>Yeah. Five, I think.</i>

2015
02:09:19,997 --> 02:09:21,931
It was a long
time ago, though.

2016
02:09:21,999 --> 02:09:24,297
Hello, boys.
This is Davy.

2017
02:09:24,368 --> 02:09:25,733
I know you'll make
him feel... Hey!

2018
02:09:26,904 --> 02:09:30,237
No. No! Hey!
Shut up!

2019
02:09:30,308 --> 02:09:32,208
Did you speak to them?

2020
02:09:32,977 --> 02:09:35,571
Yeah? You remember
any of their names?

2021
02:09:36,447 --> 02:09:38,415
Yeah.

2022
02:09:38,483 --> 02:09:39,916
Two of them
were brothers.

2023
02:09:39,984 --> 02:09:42,817
I think their last
name was Winslow.

2024
02:09:44,122 --> 02:09:46,215
<i>The oldest one
was Jeffrey.</i>

2025
02:09:50,194 --> 02:09:51,684
And Walter.

2026
02:09:54,098 --> 02:09:55,622
<i>Walter?</i>

2027
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:59,301
Yeah. Do you remember
Walter's last name?

2028
02:10:04,742 --> 02:10:06,004
Collins.

2029
02:10:07,678 --> 02:10:09,236
<i>Walter Collins.</i>

2030
02:10:10,281 --> 02:10:13,512
Tell me something if you only
remember some of the boys' names,

2031
02:10:13,584 --> 02:10:16,246
how come you remember his full name?

2032
02:10:16,988 --> 02:10:19,115
Because of
what happened.

2033
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:21,215
<i>Walter and Jeffrey
were talking.</i>

2034
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:23,226
<i>Pull it. They kept checking around</i>

2035
02:10:23,294 --> 02:10:25,888
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

2036
02:10:25,963 --> 02:10:27,555
Be careful!

2037
02:10:27,632 --> 02:10:29,327
Hurry!

2038
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,766
Maybe make enough room to
get out of there and run.

2039
02:10:31,836 --> 02:10:33,531
When we get
out, we split up,

2040
02:10:33,604 --> 02:10:35,367
go in different
directions. Okay?

2041
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:37,532
They can't catch all of us.

2042
02:10:37,608 --> 02:10:39,576
It'd make an awful
lot of noise.

2043
02:10:39,644 --> 02:10:42,374
Be quiet. You got it?

2044
02:10:42,446 --> 02:10:45,347
And if it wasn't wide
enough, then we'd be stuck.

2045
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,916
Wait. Help! Help!
Come on, hurry!

2046
02:10:52,824 --> 02:10:56,123
My foot's stuck! Hurry,
help! Help me, please!

2047
02:10:58,696 --> 02:11:01,563
He's coming!
He's...

2048
02:11:01,632 --> 02:11:03,293
My foot!

2049
02:11:04,235 --> 02:11:05,759
He's coming.

2050
02:11:05,837 --> 02:11:07,600
Hurry, run, run, run!

2051
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:15,201
Hey! What
the hell are you boys...

2052
02:11:17,081 --> 02:11:21,711
Oh! Mary, Mother of
God! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2053
02:11:22,453 --> 02:11:25,513
You get back here!
Hey! Hold it! Hey!

2054
02:11:27,992 --> 02:11:29,084
Hey!

2055
02:11:30,261 --> 02:11:31,319
Hey!

2056
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:34,157
Stop!

2057
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,865
Check on the others!

2058
02:11:37,935 --> 02:11:39,334
Stop! Damn it!

2059
02:11:39,403 --> 02:11:41,667
Boys,
I'm coming after you!

2060
02:11:41,739 --> 02:11:44,833
Damn it! Damn it!

2061
02:11:45,142 --> 02:11:48,077
Boys, I'll find you no
matter where you are!

2062
02:11:48,145 --> 02:11:50,511
They're not in there!
Come on! Get in the car!

2063
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:54,711
I'm gonna find you! Damn
it! Damn it! Come on.

2064
02:11:54,785 --> 02:11:57,185
Shit! Get in
the car, Sanford!

2065
02:12:04,662 --> 02:12:07,290
That was the last
I saw of any of them.

2066
02:12:07,865 --> 02:12:10,891
So, you don't know if either
of the other two were captured?

2067
02:12:10,968 --> 02:12:12,060
No.

2068
02:12:13,337 --> 02:12:15,237
All I know is,

2069
02:12:15,306 --> 02:12:18,173
if Walter hadn't
come back for me

2070
02:12:19,043 --> 02:12:21,773
<i>I don't think I ever
would've gotten out of there.</i>

2071
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:24,045
Okay.

2072
02:12:25,316 --> 02:12:27,477
So, what happened
after that?

2073
02:12:27,551 --> 02:12:29,246
I kept off
the main roads,

2074
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:34,280
until I saw a train stopped
at a crossing and I jumped in.

2075
02:12:34,692 --> 02:12:37,752
Why didn't you tell
anyone what had happened?

2076
02:12:37,828 --> 02:12:39,295
I was afraid.

2077
02:12:39,797 --> 02:12:42,766
I thought they'd come
after me, or my folks.

2078
02:12:44,568 --> 02:12:47,002
<i>So, I just didn't
tell anybody.</i>

2079
02:12:48,873 --> 02:12:53,071
I was on my own until I got a free
meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.

2080
02:12:53,144 --> 02:12:55,635
Told her I was an
orphan, on my own.

2081
02:12:57,615 --> 02:12:59,606
She said I could stay on.

2082
02:13:01,052 --> 02:13:02,383
And I did.

2083
02:13:03,621 --> 02:13:04,986
<i>Every night,</i>

2084
02:13:05,056 --> 02:13:08,492
I'd wake up thinking they
were right outside my window.

2085
02:13:09,026 --> 02:13:11,494
And then I heard the
police talking on the radio

2086
02:13:11,562 --> 02:13:14,326
about what happened
at the ranch.

2087
02:13:14,432 --> 02:13:16,798
And I thought, "For sure
I can't go back now. "

2088
02:13:16,867 --> 02:13:18,334
Why?

2089
02:13:18,869 --> 02:13:19,927
Why not?

2090
02:13:20,004 --> 02:13:22,802
Since I didn't tell
anybody what happened.

2091
02:13:24,175 --> 02:13:26,939
I was afraid they'd blame
me for those kids being dead.

2092
02:13:28,846 --> 02:13:30,711
So I just stayed away.

2093
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:35,442
What made you come forward
now, after all this time?

2094
02:13:35,519 --> 02:13:38,079
Hmm? Why come
forward now?

2095
02:13:41,659 --> 02:13:43,422
I really miss my mom.

2096
02:13:45,830 --> 02:13:47,730
I really miss my dad.

2097
02:13:50,768 --> 02:13:52,736
I just wanna go home.

2098
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:57,937
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

2099
02:14:03,948 --> 02:14:05,711
Are you all right?

2100
02:14:06,384 --> 02:14:08,579
I love you.

2101
02:14:41,085 --> 02:14:42,848
I still can't believe it.

2102
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:46,822
Five years, case closed, everyone
thinks he's dead, and there he is.

2103
02:14:48,325 --> 02:14:51,089
Wouldn't be, if it
wasn't for Walter.

2104
02:14:52,763 --> 02:14:55,323
Your son did a brave
thing, Mrs. Collins.

2105
02:14:55,399 --> 02:14:57,594
You should be
very proud of him.

2106
02:14:57,668 --> 02:14:58,999
I am.

2107
02:15:01,338 --> 02:15:02,896
You still think
he's out there?

2108
02:15:02,973 --> 02:15:04,201
Why not?

2109
02:15:05,443 --> 02:15:07,411
Three boys made a run for
it that night, Detective.

2110
02:15:07,478 --> 02:15:09,002
And if one got out,

2111
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:12,174
then maybe either or both
of the others did, too.

2112
02:15:12,249 --> 02:15:15,810
Maybe Walter's out there, having
the same fears that he did.

2113
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,785
Afraid to come home
and identify himself,

2114
02:15:17,855 --> 02:15:20,255
or afraid he'll get
into trouble.

2115
02:15:21,692 --> 02:15:23,785
But either way,

2116
02:15:23,861 --> 02:15:26,989
it gives me something I
didn't have before tonight.

2117
02:15:27,098 --> 02:15:28,497
What's that?

2118
02:15:29,467 --> 02:15:30,661
Hope.
