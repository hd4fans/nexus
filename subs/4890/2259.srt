1
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,725
( insects chirping )

2
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,482
My dad used to call me Klutzy-

3
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,152
This one time he took me
to a shooting range

4
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,113
and l dropped the loaded pistol

5
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,116
and it shot his best friend
in the butt.

6
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,035
And so all he could say was,

7
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,664
"Well, Klutzy's gone
and done it again-"

8
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,333
How did that make you feel?

9
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,544
Not so good-

10
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,630
Not as bad as the guy
that got shot.

11
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,094
Anyway, Gary picked up on it-

12
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,763
And after that
we'd all get together

13
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,099
and they would trade
Kiutzy stories.

14
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,893
And of course there were
a iot of them.

15
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,771
l don't know what it is
about me-

16
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,149
You know, l really-- l try

17
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,236
but l always mess up-
l always mess up-

18
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,240
( TV playing )

19
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,667
Don't you think, Daddy?

20
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,504
( changes channel )

21
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,429
( cell phone ringing )

22
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,268
Hello-

23
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,811
Hi Grandma-

24
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,354
No, she's sleeping-

25
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,898
( snoring softly )

26
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,443
Uh-huh-

27
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,530
Okay-

28
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,407
lt's out-

29
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,492
Good night, Grandma-

30
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,788
Everyone is here
because of mistakes they made---

31
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,917
myself included-

32
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,255
That really doesn't make me
feel any better-

33
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,758
Well, at least you know
you're not alone-

34
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,389
You're right- l'm sorry-

35
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,809
Lorraine, you're apologizing again-

36
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:57,814
So l hear that Gary has filed
for soie custody of Chad.

37
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,483
Yes-

38
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,071
( melody tinkling )

39
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,992
Mommy, ice cream- Mom-

40
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,371
Mommy, ice cream-

41
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,256
( tires screech )

42
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,426
How are you feeling about that?

43
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,346
Helpless-

44
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,390
Angry?

45
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,268
Guilty-

46
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,853
Why guilty?

47
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,356
Because it was
my responsibility-

48
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,817
Do you think it's your fault?

49
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,569
Well, l guess so-
l can't blame Gary-

50
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,363
i can't go biaming
the ice cream man-

51
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,365
l'm the one who let him
run out in the street

52
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,117
and neariy get hit
by an ice cream truck-

53
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,701
lt's not about blame, Lorraine-

54
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,996
lt's about coming to terms
with your anger.

55
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,916
You have a right to be angry-

56
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,584
( chuckles )

57
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,796
Who are you angry with?

58
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,134
Myself-

59
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,761
Anyone else?

60
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,515
lt's like--

61
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,393
it's like Gary said--
it was on my watch-

62
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,229
Gary was the one
who deserted you and Chad-

63
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,356
That doesn't give me an excuse
to be careless-

64
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,484
Lorraine, you fell asleep after a hard
day's work- That's not a crime-

65
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,528
Well, it is in the military-
They can shoot you for it-

66
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,113
ls that what you want?

67
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,782
Get me a gun-
l'll shoot you myself-

68
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,036
Okay, Betty, we've talked
about these outbursts-

69
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,080
lt's okay- lt's not her fault-

70
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,458
You have your own pain, you know-
We aii do.

71
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,334
You know what?
You know what your problem is?

72
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,712
You're too nice-
She's too nice-

73
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,506
That's what her problem is-
l mean, look at you-

74
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,342
After aii the stuff that
that jarhead did to you,

75
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,553
you still can't even say
a word about him.

76
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,347
Look, she's still wearing
the bum's ring-

77
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,515
Betty-

78
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,310
- Listen-- and he's not a jarhead-
- Yeah, he is.

79
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,312
No, he's not.
He's an army sergeant-

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,856
And it was my dad
who was the marine, remember?

81
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,234
You know what?
Gl, jarhead, daddy, husband--

82
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,445
what's the difference
when you're still taking orders?

83
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,363
l mean, correct me if l'm wrong,

84
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,741
but didn't Sergeant Gary
get court-martiaied?

85
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,160
He ought to be in jail-

86
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,454
You know what?
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-

87
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,915
Who cares if you have
the right to be angry?

88
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,918
Just be angry,
for God's sakes-

89
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,672
- Come on, Max-
- See you next week-

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,967
- Bye, Mrs- Burton-
- Bye, Sai.

91
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,346
Mom, l thought you quit-

92
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,097
l did-

93
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,432
Let's go get some pizza-

94
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,892
You got enough money?

95
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,645
Sure Mom's got some money-

96
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,856
Okay, come on, hon-

97
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,733
l'm playing my game-

98
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,403
No, Chad, you've got to come inside
with me, aii right?

99
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,489
l want to beat this level-

100
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,783
All right,
but you stay in the car

101
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,159
where l can see you-

102
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,036
- Okay-
- All right-

103
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,621
Thanks, Mom-

104
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,231
( distant sirens wailing )

105
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,404
Look at 'em-

106
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,241
Some guy probably ran a red light
and got the whole force after him-

107
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,077
But where are they when you need 'em?
That's what l'm saying-

108
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,623
Hey, in my iine of work
they're my best friends-

109
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,125
Yeah, you're right.
But l bet you've got a better friend---

110
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,502
( taps )
under this counter here, huh?

111
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,379
Have a nice day-

112
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,385
( imitates gunshot )

113
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,684
A lot of creeps out there, huh?

114
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,355
Would you like something else?

115
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,398
Uh, yeah-

116
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,484
A pack of American Spirit blue, please-

117
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,319
Okay-

118
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,364
( register whirring )

119
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,537
- Thank you-
- Thank you-

120
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,887
Here you go, bud-

121
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,308
l thought we were gonna
get pizza.

122
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,519
lt is pizza, sweetheart-

123
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,604
Real pizza-

124
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,981
lt is real pizza-

125
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,776
You'll see, it's good-

126
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,654
- ( exhales )
- ( engine sputtering )

127
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,702
Oh shit-

128
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,745
Mommy, you said "shit-"

129
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,497
Don't say "shit," honey-

130
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,208
l didn't say it- You did-

131
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,711
l know, l know, l know, l know-

132
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,003
Okay-

133
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,631
We need gas again?

134
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes-

135
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,443
l forgot gas-

136
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,986
How much?

137
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,447
Yeah, let's see-

138
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,908
Hold on-

139
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,581
$6, please-

140
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,833
( cell phone ringing )

141
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,002
Excuse me-

142
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,090
Hey-

143
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,844

00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,891
Yeah, l know-
l'm sorry, Gary- Please-

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,938
Listen to me.
Why are you doing this to me?

146
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,316
l can't do this, okay?
i can't do this.

147
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,985
Chad's waiting for me, okay?

148
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,363
Okay-

149
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,908

l'm sorry-

153
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,540
Are you ready for pizza?

154
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,084
Do we have enough for Roy?

155
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,585
Who's Roy?

156
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,631
( screams )

157
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,174
Oh please-

Oh my God, please don't hurt us-
Please get out of our car-

162
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,063

You got a car, don't you?

163
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,649
Just drive-

164
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,026
( uncocks gun )

165
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,738
Nice and easy-

166
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,449
Just drive-

167
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,924
( truck horn blows )

168
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,193
Sure you want to get
such a good look at me?

169
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,489
May be healthier not to-

170
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,743
Oh man-

171
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,745
Oh God, you're bleeding-

172
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,538
Roy: Huh?

173
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,498
- On your hand-
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,751
There's a first-aid kit

175
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,920
under the seat in the back-

176
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,796
What?

177
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,091
l have it in case
there's an accident or--

178
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,761
lt ain't my blood, lady-

179
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,137
Whose blood is it?

180
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,515
Oh, it's just general blood-

181
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,808
Like an army general?

182
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,811
You're funny.
You got a cute kid here-

183
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,688
My daddy is in the army-

184
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,690
No way-

185
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,234
Where's he at tonight?

186
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,945
He's at home-

187
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,364
We just stepped out
to get something to eat-

188
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,865
Oh yeah?

189
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,242
What did you guys get?
Mind if l take a look?

190
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,412
Check it out--
two whole mini-pizzas-

191
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,041
You were planning quite a feast
for the three of you, huh?

192
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,211
Could have invited the neighbors-
Just kidding.

193
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,088
You see that park
up here on the right?

194
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,632
Want to pull over there, please?

195
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,554
Okay- Oh man-

196
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,232
That's good-

197
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,032
Hey there, bud-

198
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,535
l'll be back in a jiffy-

199
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,289
lt's gonna be all right-

200
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,751
Lorraine:
Oh my God-

201
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,464
Yeah, it's Roy-

202
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,551
Did you make it there all right?

203
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,013
What?

204
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,933
Fuck.
God damn it-

205
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,271
Same shit happened to me-
There's roadblocks everywhere,

206
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,607
all over the goddamn place-

207
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,860
No, you stay there, all right?

208
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,279
lt'll take me six hours-
i'ii be there.

209
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,989
Stay there-

210
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,158
Yeah-

211
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,830
lt's okay- All right-

212
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,064
Hey, bud, why don't you
hop in the back seat, all right?

213
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,650
Lorraine: Go ahead-

214
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,988
Get on in there- Yeah-
There you go.

215
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,409
( whistles )
Nice and clean-

216
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,162
Now we're one big,
happy family, huh?

217
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,793
( starts engine )

218
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,319
Where are you taking us?

219
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,447
Weii, it's more iike
where you're taking me, huh?

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,616
You know how to find
the highway from here?

221
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,078
Um, l think so-

222
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,914
Do you know how to find the highway
from here? lt's a simple question-

223
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,167
Yes, l do-

224
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,961
Sorry, l just--

225
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,630
my shrink tells me l have a hard time
deaiing with ambiguity.

226
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,466
That means let's cut the maybes,

227
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,177
the l-don't-think-sos, the probablys-
You know what l mean?

228
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,221
- Mm-hmm.
- You understand?

229
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,223
l do- Actually it's really funny,

230
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,392
because my therapist says

231
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,436
that l am too ambiguous-

232
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,480
l am too ambiguous-

233
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,525
Let's just go to the highway-

234
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,446
Roy: Right-

235
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,159
Mommy-

236
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,451
Yeah, hon?

237
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,620
Are you crying again?

238
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,917
- Who's crying?
- Mommy's crying-

239
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,044
l'm not crying, honey-

240
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,589
i think you're right, buddy.
l think your mom is crying-

241
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,757
Now why are you crying?

242
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,096
Chad says you're crying again-
Why would he say that?

243
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,350
- What's your mom's name, bud?
- Lorraine-

244
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,436
Lorraine? Holy shit-

245
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,479
Mommy, Roy said "shit-"

246
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,065
- Don't say "shit," honey-
- Now you said it.

247
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,276
l'm sorry- l apologize-

248
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,029
Lorraine-- you know,
such a beautiful name-

249
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,990
i had a very speciai woman
in my life named Lorraine actually-

250
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,491
Really?

251
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,120
She had an intimate relationship
with my backside in my formative years--

252
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,415
yeah, her and her little
hickory stick.

253
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,084
Never mind there, buddy.
You wouldn't understand-

254
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,588
But that's my tale of woe-
We've aii got 'em, right?

255
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,048
Yeah-

256
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,217
- lt's a joke-
- What?

257
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,220
Lorraine, "backside, tail"--

258
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,555
- You get it? What's that called?
- Yeah yeah, i get it.

259
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,015
A pun-

260
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,142
- Huh?
- lt's called a pun-

261
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,602
- A pun, yeah-
- Yeah.

262
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,480
You're right.
You've got a smart mama there, boy-

263
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,441
l hope she's a better mom
than mine was-

264
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,902
Mom wasn't nice to you, huh?

265
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,783
l'm sorry-

266
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,535
Just find the freeway, okay?

267
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,829
Yeah, okay-

268
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,870
Um, there's a roadblock-

269
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,251
- You see that?
- Yeah- Oh yeah-

270
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,545
And that's for little old me-

271
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,171
So l'm gonna turn around, okay?

272
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,923
No, l want you to do
what l tell you to do-

273
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,259
l want you to relax
and drive the car-

274
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,220
So why don't we be the nice little
happy fake family that we are?

275
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,848
And we'll go through smiling, okay?

276
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,474
- ( cocks gun )
- Just reiax.

277
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,437
Just drive-

278
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,357
( police radio chatter )

279
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,495
Easy, Lorraine-

280
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,497
( police radio chatter continues )

281
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,172
Evening, folks-

282
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,591
What's going on, Officer?

283
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,135
We've got a couple bank robbers
on the ioose.

284
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,262
Don't be alarmed-
We got them bottled up-

285
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,139
You folks heading out of town?

286
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,183
Um, yes-

287
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,267
Where to?

288
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,186
We're just going a couple exits
down the highway

289
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,188
to that new steak joint-
You been there?

290
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,023
Officer:
Yeah, it's pretty good-

291
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,108
Look, l'm gonna need
to see your lD-

292
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,652
Yeah, no problem-

293
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,660
Lorraine: Do you have a description
of the robbers, Officer?

294
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,537
Maybe we've seen something-

295
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,169
There's not much of one-
Two white maies--

296
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,421
one medium-build, one heavyset-

297
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,631
What did they do?

298
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,843
Walked into a bank in broad daylight
and took a whole bunch of money-

299
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,073
We've only got one witness who saw
anything. it's the sheriff's deputy.

300
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,200
He's in the hospital right now
getting buiiets taken out.

301
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,327
Oh, one of them shot him?

302
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,579
Jesus- lt's too bad-

303
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,290
So is he the only one
that got shot or--?

304
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,584
No, we think we got
one of the bank robbers too-

305
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,478
l guess you used to be
in the military, huh?

306
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,897
( chuckles )

307
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,694
Can't say l blame you
for letting it grow-

308
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,946
Yeah-

309
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,616
is there anything eise
we can do for you, sir?

310
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,036
Yeah, there's just one thing-

311
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,584
You know you're breaking
the law, don't you?

312
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,012
Your son needs to be
in a seat belt-

313
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,432
Oh- Chad, what did l
teii you, buddy?

314
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,892
Are you gonna give us a ticket,
Officer?

315
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,060
- Roy: You gotta put your belt on-
- Not right now.

316
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,355
Little man, do me a favor- Make sure
that seat belt's buckled at all times-

317
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,399
Yeah, we got it-
l'm sorry, Officer-

318
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,193
You folks have a good night-

319
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,736
Thank you-

320
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,739
Drive-

321
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,351
Why did that officer think
l used to be in the military?

322
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,394
Did you?
Maybe he could tell-

323
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,649
That's a theory, Lorraine,
except l never was in the military-

324
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,321
Let me show you something-

00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,165
Oh, my-- no-

00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah, but l want to see it-
Oh, here we go-

330
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,922

331
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,216
What have we got here?

332
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,468
Aha- Hey, little man,

333
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,387
who's in that picture, eh?

334
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,473
That's me and Mommy-

335
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,475
- And?
- And Daddy-

336
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,560
And Daddy-

337
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,729

338
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,856

339
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,568
of the family finances
from now on,

340
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,404
except there's no cash-

341
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,574
You've got no credit cards.
What do you guys do for money?

342
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,034
l don't get paid till Friday,
aii right?

343
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,579
Weii, that seems weird.
So what do you do Monday,

344
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,414
Tuesday, Wednesday--
all the days--?

345
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,458
- We get by.
- Get by on frozen mini-pizzas

346
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,085
is what you get by on, huh?

347
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,629
You couid buy a ioaf of bread
and a jar of peanut butter for Chad

348
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,756
- with all the money that it cost for-- - Are you
questioning

349
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,592
- how l feed my child?
- ( tires screech )

350
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,719
- Whoa, put your hands on the wheel-
- l'm sorry- Okay-

351
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,053
- Control the goddamn car-
- Okay-

352
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,222
Are you forgetting what this is?

353
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,640
No-

354
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,393
Who do you think has control
of this situation, huh?

355
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,395
You do-

356
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,980
Well, that's good
you know that.

357
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,025
lt's strange, 'cause a guy
with a deadly firearm in your car--

358
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,235
l thought l set
the ground rules for you-

359
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,321
But your mom-- she's a bit---
( whisties )

360
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,990
loopy-
She's forgetting some details-

361
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,576
- l was just trying to--
- Well, now you're a little fuzzy

362
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,495
on the detaiis, so what i want to do
is start over and lay them out for you-

363
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,290
As iong as i'm in this car,
there's gonna be no more crying,

364
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,876
lying or chit-chat-
You understand me?

365
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,587
Fine- You're just not
understanding what l'm sa--

366
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,465
Uh-uh, that sounds like chit-chat,
Lorraine-

367
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,091
We just covered that-

368
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,094
lf you take me
where l gotta go

369
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,138
and you don't lie,

370
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,850
everything's gonna be fine.
You and your boy will be safe-

371
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,479
This is what we call
a little grace period

372
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,939
and it starts now-

373
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,962
What have you got
in that pocket there?

374
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,506
What?

375
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,716
Now don't play innocent
with me, Lorraine.

376
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,510
ln your little pocket-

377
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,969
What?

378
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,851
Oh. i-- i quit.
l'm trying to quit-

379
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,854
- Sorry, buddy.
- lt's okay, Mom-

380
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,148
- Have one- lt will calm your nerves-
- No- No, thank you-

381
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,109
- How about you, bud?
- No.

382
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,528
i'm kidding.
You're not gonna be a smoker-

383
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,655
lt's a horrible habit-

384
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,838
What?

385
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,717
You're a beautiful woman-

386
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,686
You seem a little sad though-

387
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,776
l bet you clean up real nice-

388
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,700
Looks like we're running out
of gas.

389
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,785
So why don't we stop?
We've got a long trip ahead of us-

390
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,663
Well, as you have seen,
i don't have a dime.

391
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,331
- Yeah, no shit-
- Mommy.

392
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,960
Sorry- That's two strikes for Roy-
i'm sorry.

393
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,506
l'm rather flush at the moment,
so it shouldn't be a problem-

394
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,884
Let's get some gas-

395
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,263
Man: Hi-

And pie-- he likes pie-

402
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,789
That's a lot of sugar, but okay-

403
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,708
Let's get some burgers too, huh,

404
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,836

408
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,969
We're gonna order our food,
right, bud?

409
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,347
Be quick, all right?
Come sit with me, bud-

410
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,769
Lorraine, we'll be right here,
so hurry up, okay?

411
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,566
Oh my God-

412
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,615
Shit-

413
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,790
You want a pork rind?

414
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,336
Don't hurt my mom-

415
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,923

00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,760
i'm iistening to you.

417
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,555
You've just got to do what l say
a little longer-

418
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,938
Hancock-- near Hancock-

419
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,733
Off Highway 61 -

420
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,068
- Woman: What city, please?
- i don't know what city.

421
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,778
Can you speak louder?
l can't hear you-

422
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,905
What?

423
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,283
Hold on-

424
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,622
- You play baseball or what?
- Tee ball-

425
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,332
Tee ball? What position?

426
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,793
You don't know?
Your dad never told you?

427
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,963
What's he doing-- this guy?
He's got to step it up a notch-

428
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,633
Me-- l played second base-

429
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,428
So if you want to hit
those home runs,

430
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,973
you've got to get ready-
You've got to wait for that pitch-

431
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,268
Bang!
( whistles )

432
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,978
A miie away.
You see that thing go?

433
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,397
Come on, you try-
You try-

434
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,150
You're a righty, huh?

435
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,319
All right, now you want to wait
for that pitch.

436
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,614
it's aii in the hips.
Look at that pitcher in the eye-

437
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,951
Three, two, one-

438
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,994
Boom! Whoa-

439
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,497
See, now that would have been
a home run, buddy.

440
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,708
Don't forget
what l taught you, okay?

441
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,919
Your mom's awfully slow,
isn't she?

442
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,588
Let's go see what's going on-

443
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,218
Lorraine, how is it going
in there?

444
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,596
- l'll be right there-
- Lorraine, turn the water off-

445
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,181
We've got to get moving here-

446
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,976
Hello- Um, is this 91 1?

447
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,811
Woman: This is lnformation-
Who are you caiiing?

448
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,981
- Wait, it's not 91 1?
- No, this is lnformation-

449
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,024
Hello? What?

450
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,026
Oh my God-
Oh my God-

451
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,820
Are you talking to somebody
in there?

452
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,697
Lorraine: Hold on-

453
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,157
Oh my God-
Oh my God-

454
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,623
All right, you've got 10 seconds
or l'm taking Chad with me-

455
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,003
( whispering )
Okay okay.

456
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,380
( knocks on door )

457
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,757
Roy: Hey, Lorraine,
how are we doing in there?

458
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,011
Oh-

459
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,098
Roy: Yeah, we're gonna
ieave you behind.

460
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,353
What the hell are you doing
in there, Lorraine?

461
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,273
Excuse me-

462
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,774
l was praying-

463
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,268
Mm- Good, huh?

464
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,978
Mm-hmm-

465
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,855
Sure you don't want
a burger, Lorraine?

466
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,982
l'm not hungry-

467
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,234
You don't know what
you're missing, Lorraine-

468
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,320
These are truck-stop burgers,
right?

469
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,365
None of those prefab fast-food crap,
right, bud?

470
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,745
You've got a good boy here,
Lorraine-

471
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,039
Look, how about
some French fries?

472
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,124
At ieast have a fry.
You've got to eat something-

473
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,044
Come on.
You need to eat something-

474
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,087
Thank you-

475
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,090
Yeah. Here.
lt's pretty good-

476
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,674
What is that?

477
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,718
- Huh?
- Under the bag-

478
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,762
Oh, show your mom-

479
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,890
How about that, huh?
Amazing-

480
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,726
You can get anything
in a truck stop these days,

481
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,937
even love, so l'm told-

482
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,648
Well, he already has one-
His dad bought it for him-

483
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,943
Actually you're wrong about that,
'cause l asked him- He doesn't-

484
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,946
l'll see you in a bit-

485
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,698
l'm going up front, buddy,
going up front-

486
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,578
Jesus, Roy-

487
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,379
So remember

488
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,090
when i toid you we had
a long drive ahead of us?

489
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,967
You never asked how far-

490
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,345
Well, l figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know-

491
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,014
You're in controi
of the situation, remember?

492
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:47,060
Good girl-
You're learning-

493
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,147
Basically l've got a rendezvous
with a partner of mine

494
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,357
about 350 miles away-

495
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,152
You think you can make it there
with no hiccups,

496
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,237
no speeding tickets?

497
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,365
l think so-

498
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,953
l mean, yes-
Definitely yes-

499
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,165
- You're a fast learner-
- Yeah, thanks-

500
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,989
Slow down, Lorraine-
What are you doing?

501
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,407
There's a cop behind us-

502
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,076
l'm sorry- l didn't mean to-
l'm nervous-

503
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,536
God damn it- Just take it slow
and calm down now-

504
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,830
( siren wailing )

505
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,354
( chuckies )
We got lucky-

506
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,439
Oh, he's pulling somebody over-

507
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,860
That dude is wasted-

508
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,196
How do people go and drive
in that condition, you know?

509
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,323
lt amazes me-

510
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,743
You're awfuiiy seif-righteous
sometimes for a bank robber-

511
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,328
Really?

512
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,330
Oh, l didn't know
that in the ground rules

513
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,666
l asked you to comment
on my character-

514
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,209
Sorry-

515
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,129
But l'll let it slide-

516
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,423
lt's funny-- it reminds me
of that shrink again-

517
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,427
l mean, he called me
a rigid moraiist.

518
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,971
How about that--

519
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,015
a rigid moralist?

520
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,142
Well, if you really want
my opinion,

521
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,602
l mean,

522
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,148
i'd say you have
sociopathic tendencies maybe,

523
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,191
but, um,

524
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,777
l don't really know
what a moralist is, to be honest-

525
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,364
Well, it means that l have
a very strong, strict code

526
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,907
for what's right and wrong-

527
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,702
lt means l don't deal
with compromises.

528
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,788
l don't accept them-
l believe what's right is right-

529
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,958
lt's funny, you know,
'cause all these people out there--

530
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,377
they think if you're a criminal,

531
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,171
- you don't have any morals-
- Right?

532
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,006
lt just isn't true-
it's garbage.

533
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,425
l mean, you look at all these
law-abiding people everywhere

534
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,219
and they don't know morals
from molasses-

535
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,181
And then these peopie--
they think, "Oh, l'm gonna play it safe

536
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,476
and l'm gonna do it this way-"
And that makes them feel righteous-

537
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,145
They're nothing but sheep-

538
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,067
l think l'm a sheep-

539
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,403
What?

540
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,989
You think l'm a sheep?

541
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,283
Um,

542
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,037
no, l think you're a whole other
class of something else-

543
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,332
l think things
got twisted up for you-

544
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,292
You don't know
which way to jump-

545
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,628
That's what l find-

546
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,006
Tell me about your old man-

547
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,384
What's your tale of woe?

548
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,846
No tale- We're divorced-

549
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,934
So you divorced him
and he's not getting any tail, right?

550
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,312
Get that?

551
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,648
- "Tail"-- you see what l did there?
- Yeah, a pun- l get it-

552
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,441
lt's funny-

553
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,485
( laughs )

554
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,738
Yeah, it's funny-

555
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:19,666
Did he ever hit you?

556
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,710
Once-

557
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,927
Well, see, there you go-

558
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,430
You do know right from wrong,

559
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,306
'cause you didn't take it-
You left-

560
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,309
You took your boy
and protected him and yourself-

561
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,479
What else is there?

562
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,441
l think l've taken very good care
of my boy, you know?

563
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,861
Now why would you care
what l think?

564
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,904
- l'm a criminal-
- ( laughing )

565
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,865
That's what l am, right?

566
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,201
You care what a criminal thinks
of your parenting skiiis?

567
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,454
- That's a little crazy-
- Yeah-

568
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,459
This is nice, you know?

569
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,669
lt's nice to just be able to have
a conversation with you.

570
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,713
i think the more
you get to know me,

571
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,340
the more we get along-

572
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,886
l think what it all
boiis down to

573
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,430
is l like talking to you-

574
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,849
l haven't had that in a while-

575
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,854
So---

576
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,064
when are you gonna
let us go?

577
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,360
l mean, you're probably gonna
let us go soon, right?

578
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,695
Huh-

579
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,406
Talk about the fickle females-

580
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,325
( chuckles )
l mean, here we are-

581
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,660
We've just-- kind ofjust had
a great conversation.

582
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,329
l'm opening up to you-

583
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,831
- l'm feeling kind of vulnerable and--
- No, that's not what i meant.

584
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,084
- That's not--
- Well, Lorraine, you do me right,

585
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,253
and l'll send you
and your boy off

586
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,964
with a smiie
and a fond farewell-

587
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,467
But you do me wrong,

588
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,178
and you and little Chaddy

589
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,222
are really fucked-

590
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,225
Are you threatening
my son now?

591
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,019
l'm threatening you
and your son.

592
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,792
- You got your brights on?
- No-

593
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,504
Well, just slow down-

594
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,841
i think there might be
a speed trap up ahead-

595
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,844
Hello- Lorraine-

596
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,641
Hello, crazy woman-
Lorraine-

597
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,936
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-

598
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,522
Who cares if you have the right
to be angry?

599
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,025
Just be angry, for God's sakes-

600
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,194
Lorraine, l said slow down-

601
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,071
- ( Lorraine screams )
- ( grunts )

602
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,741
- ( tires screeching )
- Damn it-

603
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,749
Come on-
Come on, honey-

604
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,001
- Come on, come on-
- ( car horn honks )

605
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,629
Oh God- Help!

606
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,047
Help!

607
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,591
Lorraine!

608
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,092
Help!

609
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,347
- Come here.
- ( Lorraine screams )

610
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,723
- Lorraine: Chad, Chad!
- Get up.

611
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,351
- Roy: We're just playing tag, buddy-
- Run! Chad, run!

612
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,394
Get up-

613
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,605
What the fuck
are you trying to do?

614
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,607
Huh? What did we
just talk about?

615
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,193
- Don't hurt my boy.
- What did we just talk about?

616
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,528
- Don't hurt my boy-
- Mommy.

617
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,822
Listen to me-

618
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,824

619
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,826

620
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,204

621
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,416
Fucking-- i smeii iike

622
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,044
Thanks-
Let's get back to the car-

623
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,171
Come on-

624
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,715
Hey, Chad, you're gonna
get in the back, okay?

625
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,387
Mom's up front with me-
l'm gonna drive-

626
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,430
- Lorraine: Okay, go ahead-
- i'ii get him.

627
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,474
You get in- You get in-

628
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,768
Your mom's a real pistol, huh?

629
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,230
A real pistol-

630
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,778
Lorraine: lt's okay-

631
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,739
( panting )
Okay okay okay-

632
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:05,702
- Okay, let's try this again-
- Oh my God. Okay.

633
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,037
( tires screech )

634
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,021
So l've got about 250 grand

635
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,023
and another 350
and some change

636
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,025
waiting for me

637
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,694
Good for you-

638
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,946
So if l get away with this,
l've got everything to live for-

639
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,157
lf l get caught,

640
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,784
l've got nothing to lose-

641
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,787
l have to go to the bathroom-

642
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,915
Can you pull over, please?

643
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,209
No, we were just there.
You should have gone there, bud-

644
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,420
- l'm sorry-

645
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,590
Please just pull over and l promise
l won't give you any more trouble-

646
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,509
You always say that-
Here, iittie buddy.

647
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,927
Got a cup-
l've done it before-

648
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,971
No. No no no.
Honey, put on your earphones-

649
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,432
Pay attention to your video game-
We'ii stop soon, aii right?

650
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
You can hold it-

651
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,602
We're not stopping, Lorraine-

652
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,687
l'm betting we are-

653
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,815
Okay, you want to bet?
Let's do it. Ante up.

654
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,985
- What?
- l've got 550, a little more,

655
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,362
saying that we're not stopping-
What have you got?

656
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,947
l don't want your money-

657
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,075
What are you gonna bet, Lorraine?
You've got to put something up.

658
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,286
l have nothing-

659
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,747
That's not necessarily true-

660
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,921
Okay.
Okay, how about this?

661
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,089
lf l win, you let us go-

662
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,926
And if l lose,
l won't be any more trouble-

663
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,637
Hmm, that's what
you said before-

664
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,972
You already lied once to me-

665
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,517
( cell phone buzzing )

666
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,813
And now yourjacket's buzzing-

667
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,856
- What the hell is that, Lorraine?
- i don't--

668
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,900
- Lying to me again.
- l don't know what that is-

669
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,069
- Give me the goddamn phone-
- Stop it-

670
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,071
Who's calling?

671
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,614
- Who is it?
- Gary.

672
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,033
- Gary? Who's that?
- My-- my ex-husband-

673
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,495
- Hello-
- Give me the phone-

674
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,871
Hey- Gary?

675
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,542
Well, yeah- Hey- How are you?
This is John.

676
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,670
Yeah, Lorraine's here,
but she's a bit tied up right now-

677
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,631
l've got a question for you:
is it true you've got this

678
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,675
little pee-pee the size
of a baby gherkin?

679
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,885
'Cause Lorraine told me you did-

680
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,971
And unfortunateiy
l was thinking about that-

681
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,139
Being a divorced man and all,
and you're going out,

682
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,684
probably trying
to meet some ladies-

683
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,978
Uh-huh.
Well, that's--

684
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,022
that's kind of insulting,
since we've never met-

685
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,149
Why don't you listen to this, Gary?

686
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,278
This is the sound of you
being tossed out on your ass-

687
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,072
( chuckies )
Why did you do that?

688
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,701
( tires screech )

689
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,162
All right, bud, you can go
take a leak now if you want-

690
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,666
lt's okay, hon- Just stay right outside
the door, okay, so Mom can see you-

691
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,168
Roy: Yeah, be safe-
Just stay right close to the car, okay?

692
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,504
Me and your mom are right here-
Good boy-

693
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,131
Yeah, just right there-

694
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,966
Listen to me.
l want some answers

695
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,343
and l want some fucking answers
right now.

696
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,804
You had a phone in that bathroom-

697
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,764
You were at the gas station-
Did you make a call?

698
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,517
- Did you make a phone call?
- Yes- Yes, l did-

699
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,728
Who did you call? Gary?
That fucking prick?

700
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,063
- No.
- Who? You call 91 1 , the police?

701
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,523
No-

702
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,776
So who'd you caii, Lorraine?
l'm not fucking around anymore-

703
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,905
l tried to call 91 1 ,

704
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,407
- but l didn't- lnstead--
- Don't lie to me-

705
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,286
i am not iying, i swear.
l promise you that l called 41 1 -

706
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,997
And the operator-- she asked me
what city l was in

707
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,124
and i didn't understand
what she was asking me

708
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,251
and l got confused-

709
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,796
l tried to call 91 1 -
lt didn't work-

710
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,716
So you're telling me
you called 41 1

711
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,509
- instead of 91 1 -
- Yep-

712
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,095
And then you're telling me
that you forgot to turn your phone off-

713
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,848
- Yep-
- Well, you're a fucking train wreck-

714
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,101
Maybe you don't want me
to iet you go.

715
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,188
- You must really like me-
- Chad: i'm done.

716
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,981
Hey, bud, come on back in-

717
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,026
Lorraine: Come on, hon-
Come back in- Come on-

718
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,486
You feel better?

719
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,906
- Lorraine: That's my boy.
- All right, let's keep going here-

720
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,659
Okay, baby, why don't you
lie down and get some rest?

721
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,953
Okay, Mommy-

722
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,043
Are you into politics, Lorraine?

723
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,379
Like which way do you vote?

724
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,008
l don't know-

725
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,927
l voted the way
Gary wanted me to-

726
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,056
Weii, that's siiiy.
You don't have your own opinions?

727
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,768
i wouidn't iet you do that.
l'd want you to do what you want to do-

728
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,065
You know what?
You're right-

729
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,359
l need to be more in control-

730
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,195
l'm gonna make some changes
when l get home, l'm telling you-

731
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,907
Roy: Well, if everything
goes to pian for me,

732
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,076
l'd like to make
some changes too-

733
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,078
Lorraine:
You should, you know-

734
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,706
Settie down.
Find someone to settle down with-

735
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,959
Get yourself a nice wife

736
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,670
and a boy of your own-

737
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,172
ls that an invitation?

738
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,385
l'd love to have my own family-

739
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,181
l'd love to have a little boy
iike Chaddy back there.

740
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,726
Yeah, l want three girls too-

741
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,687
Man, if l had
three little daughters,

742
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,815
i wouid protect them so much,
they'd never have a worry in the world-

743
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,693
i'd raise my boy
to be real strong

744
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,821
so after l'm gone
he'd look after them-

745
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,621
You ever been to Mexico?

746
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,082
Tijuana once-

747
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,292
That's a shithole-

748
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,753
No, l'm talking the real Mexico,

749
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,005
up in the mountains-- pueblos-

750
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,841
l mean, it's cool- lt's dry-
The air is crisp-

751
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,885
l always wanted to go
to a puebio.

752
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,721
You know, in fourth grade you build
those sort of ciay modeis.

753
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,266
And l used to pretend l was one of
the guys in there and i iived there.

754
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,435
And the people are so great
in the puebios.

755
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,689
i mean, it's the opposite of
what we were talking about earlier-

756
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,442
And taik about iiving--
l mean, a man with a little money--

757
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,821
we'd own that town.
l mean, we'd have a big house,

758
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,491
hunt and fish
and drink tequila every day-

759
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,411
Come wintertime, we could also
drive down to Cabo San Lucas

760
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,831
and get a big villa on the beach,

761
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,624
even have servants-

762
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,210
Wouldn't that be something?

763
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,171
Yeah-

764
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,173
And you don't have to worry
about the ianguage,

765
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,009
'cause most people
speak Engiish.

766
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,970
Oh really?

767
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,014
i actuaiiy aiways wanted
to learn how to speak Spanish-

768
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,225
l always wanted to travel too,

769
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,352
but then, l don't know,

770
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,105
l guess l got married too young-

771
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,983
l was even gonna go to college,
but my dad said

772
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,819
l was too dumb and too pretty-

773
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,740
Are you really going to Mexico?

774
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,868
You're not getting it-

775
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,579
We're going to Mexico-

776
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,171
l--

777
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,048
We're going to Mexico,
Lorraine-

778
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,300
l can't-

779
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,011
Roy, this is crazy.
l can't go to Mexico-

780
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,929
l can't take Chad there-

781
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,015
l mean, we have a whole life here
and he's just--

782
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,850
Right, yeah, a big life--

783
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,019
you, Chad and all those
frozen mini-pizzas-

784
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,772
l'm trying to give you
a way out, Lorraine-

785
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,357
( quiet thud )

786
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,443
What's going on with the car,
Lorraine?

787
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,195
- Lorraine: Oh God-
- Hoid on.

788
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,655
- Oh God, oh God, oh God-
- Let me pull over- Hold up-

789

01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:34,787
Give me my fucking money!

1103
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,498
Come and get it-

1104
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:42,920
Fuck-

1105
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:48,092
- ( gun ciicking )
- ( Lorraine screams )

1106
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,643
( whimpers )

1107
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:11,240
Show me your hands!

1108
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,913
Get out of the car-

1109
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,420
What happened?

1110
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,214
There was-- there was a man-

1111
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,427
Shots fired.
Requesting immediate--

1112
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,637
- ( gunshot )
- ( Lorraine exclaims )

1113
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,564
Roy, let's stop this, okay?

1114
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,774
You want to keep playing
with me, huh?

1115
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:48,235
- ls that what you want?
- No.

1116
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,904
No-

1117
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,282
What are you looking at, huh?

1118
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,784
Are you looking at his gun?

1119
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:59,705
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go for it?

1120
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:03,334
Why don't you try?
You're not that far.

1121
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,753
Look, l'll make it
easier for you-

1122
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,714
( screams )

1123
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,674
( moaning )

1124
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,885
Did that feel good?

1125
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:16,889
( chuckles )
Now you're even closer, aren't you?

1126
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,850
What, are you a foot,
maybe two feet away?

1127
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,061
You can make that-

1128
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:23,812
Come on, honey, you can do it-

1129
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,356
You can make that-

1130
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,985
You know what?
Fuck it-

1131
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:36,158
( Roy coughs )

1132
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,082
( gasping )

1133
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,894
l guess Mexico is out, huh?

1134
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,966
On the matter of
the custody of Chad,

1135
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:38,095
l find that Mr- Burton has not shown
any convincing evidence

1136
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,806
as to the chiid negiect
on the part of Mrs- Burton-

1137
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,392
- Therefore she will retain custody-
- But Your Honor, you don't--

1138
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,104
And frankly, Mr- Burton,
considering your recent legal troubles,

1139
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,274
i am amazed
that you had the chutzpah

1140
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,317
to even bring these charges-

1141
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:55,154
But l must commend you
on getting a good job

1142
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,823
so soon after your
court martial-

1143
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,784
And you can share your good fortune
by paying Mrs. Burton

1144
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:02,453
$400 a month in child support-

1145
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,289
$400? She just got
a $20,000 reward

1146
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,833
for that bank robber
she supposedly caught-

1147
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,668
She ought to be paying me-

1148
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,922
l can make it $500 if you like-

1149
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:20,012
ls there anything
you'd like to add, Mrs- Burton?

1150
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,306
Yes- Thank you, Your Honor-

1151
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,392
l'll be going by my maiden name now--
Miss Serrano-

1152
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,146
Judge: Right you are,
Miss Serrano.

1153
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,647
Good luck to you-

1154
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,067
Court is adjourned-

1155
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,276
Mommy!

1156
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,114
Hi, buddy- Hi-

1157
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,075
Love you so much-

1158
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,495
- Grandma: Oh, be careful-
- Who's ready for some pizza?

1159
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:46,538
Hey, Mom-

1160
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:48,499
Can it be real pizza?

1161
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:52,086
Oh, i think you can have
all the real pizza you want-

1162
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:53,921
Why do you say that?

1163
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,964
l dropped one of my
earrings down

1164
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,300
near the end of your bed
this morning.

1165
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:00,594
lt would have rolled
right underneath

1166
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,971
if that big duffle bag
hadn't been there-

1167
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:05,140
( both chuckle )

1168
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,893
What about ice cream?

1169
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,687
You want ice cream
instead of pizza?

1170
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,815
No, ice cream and pizza-

1171
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,359
- How about ice cream pizza?
- And root beer.

1172
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,569
( all laugh )

1173
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,157
( instrumental music playing )
