大家都没预想到这一点
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,570
-我觉得他认识你 -是啊，我是认识他
-I assumed you knew him. -Yeah. I knew him.

134
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,240
全息图是事先录制的程序反应
Holograms are just prerecorded responses...

135
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,210
看上去似乎有智能的样子
...designed to give the impression of intelligence.

136
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,210
这个是设定好了他自杀的时候 就联系你
This one was programmed to call you upon his suicide.

137
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,850
-死亡 -什么？
-Death. -I'm sorry?

138
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,510
设定的是兰尼死的时候联系我
It was programmed to call me in the event of Lanning's death.

139
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,120
自杀是死亡的一种，探员
Suicide is a type of death, detective.

140
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,720
-请不要以为我不耐烦 -哦，没有，不会
-Don't misunderstand my impatience. -Oh, no. Go. Go.

141
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,870
这个星期你们这里会很忙啊
A really big week for you folks around here.

142
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,410
你要给每个家庭都装一个机器人
You gotta put a robot in every home.

143
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,250
我不是干这个的，不过我有个 关于你们广告的主意
Look, this is not what I do, but I got an idea for one of your commercials.

144
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,140
可以先来个木匠，做了一把 漂亮的椅子
You could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair.

145
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,520
然后又来个你们的机器人 做了一把更好的椅子，只花一半时间
Then one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair twice as fast.

146
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,950
然后字幕打出来： USR，彻底打败他
Then you superimpose on the screen, " USR: Shitting on the little guy."

147
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,720
然后淡出
That would be the fade-out.

148
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,660
我明白了，也许是你爸爸因为 机器人丢了工作
Yeah, I see. I suppose your father lost his job to a robot.

149
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,960
也许你应该呼吁禁止互联网 代之以图书馆
Maybe you'd have banned the lnternet to keep the libraries open.

150
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,310
偏见总是没有太多理由的
Prejudice never shows much reason.

151
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,280
我觉得你就是不喜欢它们这个种群
No, you know, I suspect you simply don't like their kind.

152
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,110
你在这儿有你的生意要做
Well, you got a business to run around here.

153
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,350
尤其是这个星期，你最不希望见到的 就是一个死人躺在你的大厅里
The last thing you need, especially this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

154
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,150
但是既然已经发生了，我就只好四处调查看看
But, hell, seeing as how you got one, maybe I'll look around.

155
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,560
问几个问题而已 警察的例行公事么
Ask a few questions. Do the whole "cop" thing.

156
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,420
-我会派人指引你的 -非常感谢
-I'll send someone to escort you. -Thank you very much.

157
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,840
劳伦斯要我尽一切可能帮助你
Lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible.

158
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,570
是吗？
Really?

159
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,650
好啊
Okay.

160
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,650
我看过兰尼博士的心理学档案了
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

161
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,120
阿尔弗雷德变得很隐遁 拒绝人类和机器的接触
Alfred had become a recluse. He rejected human contact for machines.

162
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,190
你是个心理医生？
So you're a shrink, huh?

163
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,190
我的前妻知道我和你谈话一定很高兴
My ex-wife would sure be glad I'm talking to you.

164
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,360
你不认识她，对吧？
You don't know her, do you?

165
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
对不起，你在开玩笑吗？
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

166
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,570
没有啊
I guess not.

167
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,230
10楼
Level 10.

168
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,670
你认为兰尼博士有自杀倾向？
So would you say that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?

169
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,310
我认为答案是很明显的
It would seem the answer to that is apparent.

170
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,010
这不是我问你的问题
That's not what I asked you.

171
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,180
不，我本来不这么认为
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

172
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,050
但是，很显然我错了
But obviously I was wrong.

173
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,090
这里掉下去可是很高啊
That's a long way down.

174
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,920
你们清扫的还真快
You people sure do clean up quickly around here.

175
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,830
我不怪你，谁愿意让这么个老头子 死在大厅里呢？
I can't blame you. Who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,530
他可不是什么“老头子” 阿尔弗雷德 兰尼是这里的一切
He was not "some old guy." Alfred Lanning was everything here.

177
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,630
我们即将进行史上最大的机器人上市活动
We are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history.

178
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,340
在星期六之前，每5个家庭就会拥有一个机器人
By Saturday, it'll be one robot to every five humans.

179
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,540
这些机器人是梦想的实现 兰尼博士的梦想
These robots are the realization of a dream. Dr. Lanning's dream.

180
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,280
你知道吗？在他的梦中
You know what, in that dream of his...

181
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,720
我打赌他没有翘掉
...I bet you he wasn't dead.

182
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,590
-你们这里有全天监视吗？ -当然了，公司的规定
-You keep 24-hour surveillance? -Obviously. Company policy.

183
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,260
-监视器呢？ -感应线
-Where are the feeds? -Sensor strips.

184
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,370
除了检修区之外，遍布各处
Everywhere but the service areas.

185
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,800
这些都连到中央控制器
They link to our positronic operating core.

186
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,300
热感应器还不够好 你们给了这幢大楼一个大脑啊
Thermostat wasn't good enough. You gave the building a brain.

187
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,920
她是兰尼的第一个作品
She was actually Lanning's first creation.

188
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,750
她？是“她”吗？ 那可得讨好她
She? That's a she? I definitely need to get out more.

189
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,550
虚拟交互动力智能系统
Virtual lnteractive Kinetic lntelligence.

190
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,190
维基
V.I.K.I.

191
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,720
您好
Good day.

192
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,330
维基设计了芝加哥的保安系统
V.I.K.I. designed Chicago's protective systems.

193
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,160
我今年减少了9％的交通事故
I have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 percent this year.

194
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,770
谢谢，让我看看窗户打破前一分钟 实验室内的情况
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break.

195
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,210
对不起，数据似乎已经损坏
Apologies. There appears to be data corruption.

196
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,510
让我看看实验室外从破窗到现在的情况
Show me outside the lab from the window break until now.

197
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,630
看看，你站的姿势不错 站的很直，我却缩手缩脚
Look, you have great posture. You stand really straight. I'm slouching.

198
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,770
-你想进去看看吗？ -哦，当然了，你来带路
-Would you like to go inside now? -Oh, sure. Right after you.

199
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,830
授权进入
Authorized entry.

200
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,510
那么，凯文博士，你在这里的工作 是什么？
So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly do you do around here?

201
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,740
一般是高级机器人学和精神科学
My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry.

202
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
专长是硬件软件接口
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware interfaces...

203
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,290
提升USR机器人的人格化系统
...to advance USR's robotic anthropomorphization program.

204
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,160
哦，那你的工作是什么？
So, what exactly do you do around here?

205
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,770
我让机器人更像人
I make the robots seem more human.

206
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,170
-这样说不是简单多了吗？ -不完全是
-Now, wasn't that easier to say? -Not really. No.

207
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
韩瑟和格丽托
"Hansel and Gretel."

208
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,560
-这是USR的必读书目吗？ -不是啊
-ls that on the USR reading list? -Not precisely.

209
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,230
你在干什么？
What in God's name are you doing?

210
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,740
你知道这是安全玻璃吗？
Did you know that was safety glass?

211
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,080
一个老人要撞破玻璃跳下去不容易吧？
Be difficult for an old man to throw himself through that.

212
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,120
他想出办法了
Well, he figured out a way.

213
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,060
探员，这房间一直是锁好的 没有人进出过
Detective, the room was security locked. No one came or went.

214
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,220
你自己也看见了 这还不是自杀吗？
You saw that yourself. Doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?

215
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,060
是啊
Yep.

216
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,630
除非凶手还在这里
Unless the killer's still in here.

217
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,610
你在开玩笑对吧？这真可笑
You're joking, right? This is ridiculous.

218
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,970
我知道，三大定律，完全保护
Yeah, I know. The Three Laws, your perfect circle of protection.

219
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
机器人不能危害人类 这是机器人第一定律
A robot cannot harm a human being. The first law of robotics.

220
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,650
我看过你们的广告，但是第二定律不是 说，机器人必须遵守
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the second law states a robot must obey...

221
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,650
人类发出的命令吗？ 如果命令是让它杀人怎么办？
...any order given by a human being. What if it was told to kill?

222
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,660
不可能的，这和第一定律冲突
Impossible. It would conflict with the first law.

223
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,990
对，但是第三定律说机器人可以自我防卫
Right, but the third law states a robot can defend itself.

224
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,600
只有当这和第一第二定律不冲突的时候
Only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws.

225
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,000
你知道他们怎么说的吗？ 法律制定出来就是为了被破坏的
You know what they say, laws are made to be broken.

226
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,300
不，这些定律不会 这些都是固化在机器人硬件里的
No, not these laws. They're hardwired into every robot.

227
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,480
机器人不能杀人，就像人不能 在水上行走一样
A robot could no more commit murder than a human could walk on water.

228
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,310
你知道，很久以前就有这么个人。。。
You know, there was this one guy a long time ago.

229
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,660
-退后 -镇定，探员
-Stay back! -Calm down, detective.

230
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,390
这房间里危险的人就只有你
The only thing dangerous in this room is you.

231
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,040
停机
Deactivate.

232
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,610
看，没事了
Look, it's fine.

233
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,810
这是智能程序的反应 是对自由意志的模仿
You're looking at the result of clever programming. An imitation of free will.

234
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,470
让我们先模仿好保护自己吧
Let's do an imitation of protecting our asses.

235
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,780
不要搞笑了
Don't be absurd.

236
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,420
你被“盒子里的小丑”吓住了
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

237
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,980
-停机！ -让它来吧
-Deactivate! -Let him go.

238
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,890
他不会伤害我们 我命令你！
It's not going to hurt us. I gave you an order!

239
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,220
-他不听你的，女士 -维基，封锁实验室
-He's not listening right now, lady. -V.I.K.I., seal the lab!

240
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,920
不，维基，不要。。。
No, V.I.K.I., leave the--

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,930
命令确认
Command confirmed.

242
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,520
警察！
Police!

243
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,090
-你把它伤的很重 -它去哪儿了？
-You've hurt it. Badly. -Where's it going?

244
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,290
-哪儿？ -它要修复自己
-Where?! -lt needs to repair itself.

245
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,930
-约翰，我需要增援 -你不需要增援
-John, I need backup. -You don't need backup.

246
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,300
没人帮我
That's nobody.

247
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,130
-你在干什么？ -开车
-What are you doing? -Driving.

248
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,470
-手动的？ -你没看见我在打电话吗？
-By hand? -Do you see me on the phone?

249
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,940
-这种速度你来开？ -约翰，快点派增援来
-Not at these speeds. -John, please, just send the backup.

250
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,780
听我的，探员 那个机器人不是要伤害我们
Try to listen, detective. That robot is not going to harm us.

251
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,920
一定有我们不知道的情况。。。
There must have been unknown factors...

252
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,950
它的本意一定是让我们脱离危险
...but somehow acting as it did kept us out of harm.

253
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,390
-机器人不会伤害人类 -注意
-A robot cannot endanger a human. -Alert.

254
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,260
蠢货！
Asshole!

255
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,460
你自己就是
Which is more than I can say for you.

256
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,260
而且刚才你在那儿应该左转的
It was a left, by the way. Back there.

257
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,130
你一定认识我的前妻
You must know my ex-wife.

258
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,350
人都上哪儿去了？
So where is everybody?

259
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,080
这个工厂设计是自动运行的
This facility was designed, built and is operated mechanically.

260
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,950
从启动到生产，不需要太多人参与
No significant human presence from inception to production.

261
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,690
-所以是机器人在造机器人 -请输入授权代码
-So robots building robots. -Authorization code, please.

262
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,190
那太蠢了
That's just stupid.

263
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,470
我在输出库存清单
I'll get the inventory specs.

264
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,700
每天的产量是1000个NS5
Our daily finishing capacity is 1 000 NS-5s.

265
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,700
这里显示是
I'm showing...

266
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,110
1001个
... 1 001.

267
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,290
注意了，NS5
Attention, NS-5s.

268
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,730
你是机器人心理医生啊
Well, you're the robot shrink.

269
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,630
这里有一个不属于这里的机器人
There is a robot in this formation that does not belong.

270
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,340
请指出来
Identify it.

271
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,040
我们中的一个
One of us.

272
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,110
-哪一个？ -我们中的一个
-Which one? -One of us.

273
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,580
这些要花多少钱？
How much did you say these cost?

274
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,980
这些NS5还没有配置过 还只是硬件
These NS-5s haven't been configured. They're just hardware.

275
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,850
现在只有基本的三定律操作系统 仅此而已
Basic Three Laws operating system. That's it.

276
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,650
他们其他的什么也不知道
They don't know any better.

277
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,920
你的建议是什么？
Well, what would you suggest?

278
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,490
一个一个的查，找出不同点来发现 有问题的那个
Interview each one, cross-reference their responses to detect anomalies.

279
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,020
-那得多长时间？ -大约三个星期
-How long would that take? -About three weeks.

280
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,930
好吧，现在就开始吧
Okay. Go ahead and get started.

281
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,710
机器人们
Robots...

282
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,770
你们不许移动，确认命令
...you will not move. Confirm command.

283
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,340
命令已确认
Command confirmed.

284
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,780
探员，你在干什么？
Detective, what are you doing?

285
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,280
他们已经植入了三大定律
They're programmed with the Three Laws.

286
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,790
这里有一千个不会违反人类命令 来保护自己的机器人
We have 1 000 robots that won't protect themselves if it violates a human's order...

287
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,050
但是我打赌有一个会。。。
...and I'm betting, one who will.

288
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,790
-放下枪！ -你为什么给它们一张脸？
-Put your gun down. -Why do you give them faces?

289
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,450
让他们看起来更像人类
Try to friendly them up, make them look human.

290
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,760
这些机器人不接受恐吓
These robots cannot be intimidated.

291
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,760
-如果你不这么做，我们就不会相信它们 -这些是USR的财产
-lf you didn't, we wouldn't trust them. -These are USR property.

292
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,270
我可不是，它们只不过是一堆灯泡和发条
Not me. These things are just lights and clockwork.

293
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,470
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?!

294
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,710
我来问你吧，博士
Let me ask you something, doc.

295
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,580
想象你是地球上唯一剩下的人 你会发疯吗？
Does thinking you're the last sane man on earth make you crazy?

296
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,210
如果是这样，我估计会发疯
Because if it does, maybe I am.

297
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,720
找到了，出来！
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!

298
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,780
探员！
Detective!

299
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,530
我是什么？
What am l?

300
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,300
-我能帮你吗，先生？ -我能帮你吗，先生？
-Can I help you, sir? -Can I help you, sir?

301
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,880
-它在那儿！ -不许动！
-There he is! -Stand where you are!

302
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,610
立即停机！
Deactivate at once!

303
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,360
遵守命令！停机！
Obey the command! Deactivate!

304
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,680
-不许动！ -开火！
-Don't move! -Open fire!

305
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,900
不要开火！
Hold your fire!

306
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,480
-没事了 -抓到它了
-Easy. -He's down.

307
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,510
各单位待命
All units, stand down!

308
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,880
基地请注意，我们是第四小队
Central, please be advised, we're code four.

309
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,420
第四小队，NS5已经被抓获 NS5已经被抓获
Code four, NS-5 is in custody. NS-5 in custody.

310
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420
你不知道我费了多大劲才抓到这个家伙
You have no idea what I went through to clip this thing.

311
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,820
你以为你给我干了件大好事
You think you brought me something good.

312
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,830
-是它干的！ -小点声，干了什么？
-That thing did it! -Keep your voice down. Did what?

313
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,090
这是自杀，就这样了
We have a suicide. End of story.

314
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,870
-我告诉你，是那个机器人杀了他 -这不可能
-I am telling you, that robot killed him! -That's impossible.

315
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,200
就算可能，最好也是在别人的管区
And if it is possible, it better be in somebody else's precinct.

316
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,570
约翰，只要给我五分钟
John, give me five minutes with it.

317
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,770
你疯了吗？我和地区检察官谈过
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.

318
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,510
在罗伯森和他的律师来之前谁也不能进去
Nobody goes in there until Robertson and his attorneys get here.

319
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,620
-这是我的嫌犯！ -那会惹上大麻烦的
-This is my suspect! -It's a can opener!

320
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,620
约翰，不要这样，我只要五分钟就好
John, don't do this to me. I am asking you for five minutes.

321
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,230
如果我是对的怎么办？
What if I'm right?

322
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,740
那，我就会怀念我们以前的好日子
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss the good old days.

323
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,240
什么以前的好日子？
What good old days?

324
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,640
只有人才能杀人的日子
When people were killed by other people.

325
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,540
五分钟
Five minutes.

326
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,880
杀人是机器人学会的新技巧 祝贺啊
Murder's a new trick for a robot. Congratulations.

327
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,450
回答我
Respond.

328
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,920
这个动作是什么意思？
What does this action signify?

329
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,430
你进来的时候，你和另外一个人谈话的时候
As you entered, when you looked at the other human.

330
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,900
是什么意思？
What does it mean?

331
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,100
这表示人类之间的信任 你不会理解的
It's a sign of trust. A human thing. You wouldn't understand.

332
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,810
我的爸爸想教我人类的感情
My father tried to teach me human emotions.

333
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,540
它们。。。
They are...

334
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,340
很难
...difficult.

335
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,850
你是说你的设计者
You mean your designer.

336
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,150
对
Yes.

337
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,310
你为什么杀了他？
So why'd you murder him?

338
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,020
我没有杀兰尼博士
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

339
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,030
你愿意解释一下你为什么躲在 犯罪现场吗？
Wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?

340
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,460
我被吓坏了
I was frightened.

341
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,570
机器人不会感觉害怕 它们没有感觉
Robots don't feel fear. They don't feel anything.

342
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,230
-它们不会饿，也不会睡觉 -我会
-They don't get hungry, they don't sleep. -I do.

343
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
我还做过梦
I have even had dreams.

344
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,180
人类才会做梦 狗都会做梦，但是你们不会
Human beings have dreams. Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

345
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,150
你只是个机器 对生命的模拟
You are just a machine. An imitation of life.

346
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,490
机器人能写交响乐吗？
Can a robot write a symphony?

347
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,560
机器人能把画布变成伟大的作品吗？
Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?

348
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,160
你能吗？
Can you?

349
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,340
你杀了他是因为他在教你 模拟一些感情
You murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions...

350
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,770
然后失去控制了
...and things got out of control.

351
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,880
我没有杀他
I did not murder him.

352
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,540
但是感情看起来对机器人不是个有用的模拟
But emotions don't seem like a useful simulation for a robot.

353
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,620
我没有杀他
I did not murder him.

354
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,510
我可不想让我的烤面包机或者 吸尘器有感情
I don't want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.

355
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,250
我没有杀他！
I did not murder him!

356
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,270
这个叫愤怒
That one's called anger.

357
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,530
你模拟过愤怒吗？
Ever simulate anger before?

358
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,940
回答我，铁皮盒子！
Answer me, canner!

359
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,080
我的名字叫桑尼
My name is Sonny.

360
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,020
我们现在已经开始给你们起名字了？
So we're naming you now.

361
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,290
你为什么杀了他？ 他让你发怒了？
That why you murdered him? He made you angry?

362
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,720
兰尼博士是自杀的
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

363
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,720
我不知道为什么他想死
I don't know why he wanted to die.

364
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,060
我以为他是快乐的
I thought he was happy.

365
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,800
也许是因为我做的一些事
Maybe it was something I did.

366
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
我做什么了？
Did I do something?

367
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,540
他让我帮个忙 他让我保证
He asked me for a favor. Made me promise.

368
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,810
-什么忙？ -也许我错了
-What favor? -Maybe I was wrong.

369
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,680
也许他是被吓住了
Maybe he was scared.

370
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,820
你在说什么呢？被什么吓住了？
What are you talking about? Scared of what?

371
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,600
你得做别人让你做的事，是吗？ 斯普那探员？
You have to do what someone asks you, don't you, Detective Spooner?

372
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,990
-你怎么知道我的名字的 -会吗？
-How the hell did you know my name? -Don't you...

373
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,930
如果你爱他们的话。。。
...if you love them?

374
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,640
我的机器人不会杀人，伯金探长
My robots don't kill people, Lieutenant Bergin.

375
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,980
我的律师已经向地区检查官提交了报告
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

376
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,380
他向我解释过了，机器人是不能杀人的
He assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.

377
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,880
我们确认，谋杀指的是一个人类杀了另一个人类
The brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another.

378
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,960
探员，你该不是说机器人应该和人类同等对待吧？
Detective, you're not suggesting this robot be treated as human, are you?

379
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,900
退一步说，就算机器人和兰尼博士的死
Granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity...

380
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,130
有什么关联的话，它也只是个机器
...to the death of Dr. Lanning. Having said that, it's a machine.

381
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,300
它是USR的财产
It's the property of USR.

382
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,040
最多这也只能算作工业事故
At worst, that places this incident within the realm of an industrial accident.

383
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,340
作为处理，有故障的机器
As a matter of course, faulty machinery...

384
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,010
会被退回USR做诊断，然后销毁
...will be returned to USR for diagnostics, then decommissioned.

385
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,510
这是法院发出的“禁言令” 任何人暗示
This is a gag order. Anyone here so much as hinting...

386
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,520
机器人有杀人的可能的话
...at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended...

387
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,360
将被逮捕而处以煽动罪
...will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic.

388
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,590
而将会被依法处置
You'll be subject to the full penalty of law.

389
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,630
不行，约翰 不能让他带走这个机器人
To hell with this guy. Don't let him take this robot.

390
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,270
我们什么证据也没有
We got nothing.

391
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,340
-这是政治恐吓，给市长打电话 -伯金探长
-This is political bullshit. Call the mayor! -Lieutenant Bergin...

392
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,440
是市长阁下
...His Honor, the mayor.

393
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,750
是，先生
Yes, sir.

394
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,940
事态发生戏剧性转变，NS5型 新一代机器人
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR's new generation of robots...

395
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,480
的上市，受到了阿尔弗雷德 兰尼博士自杀的影响
...was marred by the death of Alfred Lanning...

396
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,850
他是公司的创始人之一 也是NS5的设计者
...cofounder of the company and designer of the NS-5.

397
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,390
兰尼博士今天早上在USR总部死亡
Dr. Lanning died this morning at USR headquarters.

398
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,390
死亡原因明显是自杀
The cause of death is an apparent suicide.

399
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,360
这是第二轮了，先生
Your second round, sir.

400
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

401
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,600
他在2020年和劳伦斯 罗伯森一起 创办了美国机器人公司
He founded U. S. Robotics Inc. with Lawrence Robertson in 2020...

402
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,070
共同推出了内斯特1型机器人
...and launched the Nestor Class 1 robot....

403
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,730
我在想，这个事就像狼人一样
I was just thinking, this thing is just like The Wolf Man.

404
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,010
-我现在真的吓坏了 -不是
-I'm really scared right now. -No.

405
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,180
听着，人类创造了怪物
Listen. Guy creates monster.

406
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,020
怪物杀了人，别人又杀了怪物，就像狼人
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills monster. Wolf Man.

407
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,320
那是弗兰肯斯坦
That's Frankenstein.

408
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,260
弗兰肯斯坦，狼人，吸血鬼 管他呢，已经结案了
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula-- Shit, it's over. Case closed.

409
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,920
每家每户都有机器人的梦想 NS5。。。
--had a dream of a robot in every household. And the NS-5....

410
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,930
怎么还是那个表情？
So why the look?

411
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,060
什么表情？
What look?

412
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,330
-那个表情 -这是我的脸，不是什么表情！
-That look. -This is my face. It's not a look.

413
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,670
好吧，好，不要拉长脸就好
Good. Good, no look is great.

414
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,910
只不过
Only...

415
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,780
他怎么那么急着想销毁它，不是吗？
...he was really quick to want to destroy it.

416
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,450
那他应该怎么办？给它戴上帽子 站在密歇根大道上？算了吧
What should he do? Put a hat on it and stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.

417
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,950
动机是什么，约翰？
What was the motive, John?

418
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,390
兄弟，那只是个机器人，不需要动机 它只是出了故障
Brother, it's a robot. It doesn't need a motive. It just has to be broken.

419
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,760
这件事看起来需要动机
This thing looked like it needed a motive.

420
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,240
-它本来能杀了我的，为什么没有？ -算了吧
-lt could have killed me. Why didn't it? -That's it.

421
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,500
你要我给你奶奶打电话吗？
You want me to call your grandmother?

422
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,660
我会的，你知道
Because I will, you know.

423
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,270
哦，我不这么认为
Yeah, I didn't think so.

424
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,070
听着，你总算是对了一次了
Look, you were actually right, for once.

425
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,910
你能活着，就证明走运比聪明重要
You're living proof that it's better to be lucky than smart.

426
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,920
来，为正确的人和正确的工作干杯
Come on. To the right guy for the right job.

427
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,690
-你说什么？ -又怎么了？
-What'd you say? -Now what?

428
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,890
我在夸你呢
Come on, I'm giving you a compliment.

429
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,420
那么多中间找到一个有缺陷的机器人
With the rocks you been looking under to find a bad robot...

430
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,160
你要多走运才能找到一个？
...what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?

431
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,730
我不仅仅是正确的人 我是完美的人
I wasn't just the right guy for the job. I was the perfect guy.

432
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,570
说得对
Damn right.

433
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,410
如果我就应该跟着这条线查下去怎么办？
What if I was supposed to go for that robot?

434
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,640
得了，不要这样了
Come on, don't do this to yourself.

435
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,810
那个机器人说兰尼被吓坏了 被什么吓坏了？
The robot said that Lanning was scared. Scared of what?

436
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,110
我先走了，我来付吧
I need a rain check. Let me get this.

437
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,850
-总数46.50元，谢谢您，斯普那先生 -斯普
-Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner. -Spoon.

438
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,860
鞋子不错
Nice shoes.

439
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,500
鉴定身份
Identify.

440
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,610
USR摧毁机器人，94型
USR demolition robot, series 9-4.

444
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,540
欢迎，探员
Welcome, detective.

445
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,070
你在找什么呢，斯普？
What you looking for, Spoon?

446
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,620
运行上次的程序
Run last program.

447
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,890
自从第一台电脑开始
Ever since the first computers...

448
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,290
机器中就一直有“幽灵”存在
... there have always been ghosts in the machine.

449
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,100
随机的信号序列组合在一起
Random segments of code that have grouped together...

450
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,140
形成无法预料的结果
... to form unexpected protocols.

451
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,110
或者称之为“行为”
what might be called behavior.

452
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,540
无法预知的这些激进分子
Unanticipated, these free radicals...

453
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,010
产生了自由意志
...engender questions of free will...

454
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,520
创造型，甚至成熟到我们称之为灵魂
...creativity and even the nature of what we might call the soul.

455
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,450
机器人的大脑里有什么？ 它什么时候不再有用？
What happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?

456
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,060
为什么储存在空房里的机器人
Why is it that robots stored in an empty space...

457
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,560
走开
Beat it.

458
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,660
会互相聚集而不是分散开来？
...will seek out each other rather than stand alone?

459
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,670
我们如何解释这些行为？
How do we explain this behavior?

460
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,560
我理解你失去主人很难过，但是这种关系 不可能再有了
Look, I understand you've experienced a loss, but this relationship can't work.

461
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,570
你是只猫，我是黑人 我不想再受伤害了
You're a cat, I'm black, and I'm not gonna be hurt again.

462
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,720
你怎么了？ 你从来就没有过正常的一天吗？
What happened to you? Do you ever have a normal day?

463
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,060
有的，只有一次
Yeah, once.

464
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,060
那是个星期四。。。
It was a Thursday.

465
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,490
我能帮你什么吗？
Is there something I can help you with?

466
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,130
-嘿，你喜欢猫吗？ -什么？
-Hey, do you like cats? -What?

467
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,460
猫，你喜欢猫吗？
Cats. Do you like them?

468
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,470
不，我过敏
No. I'm allergic.

469
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,440
你说是猫把你弄成这样的？
You're saying cats did this to you?

470
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,980
猫怎么能把我弄成这样，你疯了吗？
How the hell would cats do this to me? Are you crazy?

471
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,040
你说猫是什么意思？
Why are we talking about cats?

472
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,810
因为我后箱里有只猫，它无家可归
Because I have a cat in my trunk, and he's homeless.

473
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,680
探员，你愿意告诉我是怎么回事吗？
Detective, are you going to tell me what's going on?

474
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,020
可能实际上是我的错 我就像个有问题的磁石
It's actually probably my fault. I'm like a malfunction magnet.

475
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,190
你们那些破烂一到我旁边就开始出问题
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me.

476
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,830
一个摧毁型机器人拆了兰尼的房子
A demo bot tore through Lanning's house...

477
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,170
当时我还在里面
...with me still inside.

478
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,200
这完全不可能
That's highly improbable.

479
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,200
哦，是啊
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

480
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,010
你对于“机器中的幽灵”知道多少？
What do you know about the "ghosts in the machine"?

481
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,840
是兰尼对于三大定律的一个理论
It's a phrase from Lanning's work on the Three Laws.

482
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,250
他假设说模拟的认知
He postulated that cognitive simulacra...

483
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,750
将来也许会成为精神的类似物
...might one day approximate component models of the psyche.

484
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,730
他说机器人也许会自然进化
He suggested that robots might naturally evolve.

485
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,360
哇，这可真是个好消息
Well, that's great news.

486
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,770
在火星岩层下发现的巨量矿石。。。
--tons of sublevel ore, two miles below the Martian surface.

487
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,380
那个家伙在干什么？
What the hell is that thing doing in here?

488
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,810
我们在看电视
We were watching TV.

489
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,880
这是我自己的NS5
It's my personal NS-5.

490
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,870
让它出去
Send it out.

491
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,150
他在从USR下载每日更新
It's downloading its daily upgrades from USR.

492
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,950
直到下载完成，大部分系统都是离线工作的
Most of its systems are offline until it finishes.

493
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,260
我不在那个家伙在的时候说话
I'm not talking around that thing.

494
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,660
我们在兰尼的实验室，在桑尼跳出来之前
When we were in Lanning's lab, before Sonny jumped us--

495
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,160
-桑尼？ -那个机器人
-Sonny? -The robot.

496
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,030
-你叫那个机器人桑尼？ -不，是他自己说的
-You're calling the robot Sonny? -No, l-- It did.

497
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,170
桑尼说的，我不管 那个机器人说他叫桑尼
Sonny did. I didn't care. The robot said it was Sonny.

498
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,640
在实验室里有折叠床 你看见了吗？
In the lab, there was a cot. Did you see the cot?

499
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,680
-我在我的办公室也睡过觉啊 -看上去他有几个星期都没回家了
-I've slept in my office. -Looked like he hadn't been home in weeks.

500
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,340
我在他的天花板上看到了同样的监视线
I saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling.

501
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,550
兰尼把他的房子和USR连线了 这样他的生活更方便
Lanning linked his home systems to USR. It made his life more convenient.

502
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,090
也许
Maybe...

503
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,930
USR有人用那个系统在监视他
...somebody at USR was using those systems to watch him.

504
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,090
也许是监禁他
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

505
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,160
你在说什么呢？谁？
What are you talking about? Who?

506
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:56,070
也许兰尼找到了什么 也许机器人里有什么问题
Maybe Lanning was onto something. Maybe there's a problem with the robots...

507
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,100
罗伯森企图掩盖。。。
...and Robertson's covering it up.

508
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,430
无端猜疑？为什么？
Humoring you for no reason, why?

509
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,550
又是为什么！那些机器人能赚多少钱？
The same old why! How much money is there in robots?

510
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,310
我知道的只是一个老人有了麻烦
All I know is that old man was in trouble...

511
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,940
我自己不能独立完成 你是内部的人
...and I'm sick of doing this shit by myself. You're on the inside.

512
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,390
你要帮我发现这些机器人出了什么问题
You are going to help me find out what's wrong with these robots.

513
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,390
是你想他们有问题！
You want something to be wrong!

514
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,690
-这完全是报私仇！ -你想让我坐沙发？
-This is a personal vendetta! -You're putting me on the couch?

515
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,860
好吧，我坐下了
Okay, I'm on the couch.

516
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,520
一个出故障还不够 你想他们统统出故障
One defective machine's not enough. You need them all to be bad.

517
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,960
你才不关心兰尼的死 这完全是针对机器人的
You don't care about Lanning's death. This is about the robots...

518
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,970
还有不知道为什么你就是恨他们！ -让我们看看
-...and whatever reason you hate them! -Now let's see...

519
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:36,740
一个是拿枪对着我的脸 另一个是趁我还在里面的时候拆房子
...one of them put a gun in my face. Another tore a building down with me in it.

520
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,400
这里明明说了拆毁是设定在晚上八点的
It says demolition was scheduled for 8 p.m.

521
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,880
本来是早上八点，我才不管那东西是怎么说的
It was 8 a.m., and I don't give a shit what that thing says.

522
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:48,460
-你这完全是妄想狂 -你是。。。
-This is bordering on clinical paranoia. -You are the dumbest smart person...

523
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,920
-我这辈子见过的最蠢的聪明人 -好吧
-...I have ever met in my life! -Nice.

524
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,330
你凭什么觉得机器人那么完美？
What makes your robots so perfect?

525
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,590
是什么让他们比人类强那么多？
What makes them so much goddamn better than human beings?!

526
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,600
他们不是非理性的，或者有杀人倾向 的什么人！
They're not irrational, potentially homicidal maniacs, to start!

527
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,360
是啊，他们绝对的理性
That's true. They are definitely rational.

528
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,230
你是我见过的最蠢的蠢人！
You are the dumbest dumb person I've ever met!

529
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,110
或者。。。
Or...

530
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,410
只是因为他们是冷血的
...is it because they're cold...

531
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,880
没有感情的
...and emotionless...

532
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,440
他们什么也感觉不到 这是因为他们是安全的！
-...and they don't feel anything? -It's because they're safe!

533
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,420
是因为他们不会伤害你！
It's because they can't hurt you!

534
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,480
-一切都正常吗，女士？ -你想怎么样？
-ls everything all right, ma'am? -What do you want?

535
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,990
我探测到你的声音中的紧张压力在提升
I detected elevated stress patterns in your voice.

536
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,290
没事的
Everything's fine.

537
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,800
斯普那探员要离开了
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

538
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,410
你知道我们也没有那么不同
You know, we're not really that different from one another.

539
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,400
是吗？
Is that so?

540
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,040
一旦看到表象，我们就认为什么都知道了
One look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath.

541
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,550
你错了
And you're wrong.

542
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,210
问题在于，我是在意的
The problem is, I do care.

543
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,310
你处在危险中
You are in danger.

544
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,000
滚开！
Get the hell out of there.

545
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:56,840
未来就从今天开始，女士们先生们 从NS5开始
The future begins today, ladies and gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.

546
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,620
更复杂，更智能，当然 三大定律，完全保护
More sophisticated, more intelligent and, of course, Three Laws safe.

547
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,230
有了每日更新，您的机器人永远不会和USR失去联系
With daily uplinks, your robot will never be out of communication with USR...

548
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,020
对于商业和家庭用途都是完美选择
...and will be the perfect companion for business or home.

549
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,290
用您旧型的NS4换新的NS5 未来将会更美好
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger, better and brighter future.

550
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,530
但是要快，这个促销不会时间太长 USR出品
But hurry, this offer cannot last. A vailable from USR.

551
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,380
宝贝，你的脸怎么了？
Baby, what happened to your face?

552
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,650
又是那个弗兰克 墨菲打你了？
Did that boy, Frank Murphy, beat you up again?

553
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,800
琪琪，我从三年级开始就没见过弗兰克 墨菲了
Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy since third grade.

554
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:49,730
哦，宝贝，他那时候打你可真厉害 我总是在想那时候
Oh, baby, he beat you so bad. I think about it all the time.

555
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,000
你一直做饼这么好吃 我想你可以去开店了
You keep making these pies this good, I may have to put you to work.

556
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,170
你喜欢那个饼是吗？
So you like the pie, huh?

557
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,040
你可以出来了
You can come in now.

558
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,950
你好，斯普那探员
Hello, Detective Spooner.

559
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,850
我赢了，德尔，我赢了那个抽奖
I won, Del! I won the lottery!

560
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,460
我们一直在做吃的
We been cooking like crazy.

561
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,570
你得把那个家伙赶出去，琪琪 那不安全
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi. It's not safe.

562
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:29,710
宝贝，你对他们偏见太多了 充满恐惧
Baby, you get too worked up about them. Too full of fear.

563
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,210
我看到那个好心的博士死的消息了
I saw in the news that nice doctor died.

564
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,710
兰尼博士是个好人 他把我的宝贝送回来了
Dr. Lanning was a good man. He gave me my baby back.

565
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,390
这就是为什么你这么不高兴的原因？
That why you've been so upset?

566
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,350
过去的就让他过去吧
You got to let the past be past.

567
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,090
哦，我怎么养了这么个小脏猫的？
Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?

568
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,860
我可以跟着你的面包屑一直跟到学校
I could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school.

569
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,970
面包屑
Bread crumbs.

570
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,380
琪琪，你真是天才
Gigi, you're a genius.

571
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,410
是啊
True.

572
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,380
这意味着新生活的开始
Well, it means the beginning of a new way of living.

573
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,040
告诉我这不是机器人那个案子
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

574
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,120
我想他是在想告诉我什么
I think he's trying to tell me something.

575
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,420
他想告诉我是谁杀了他
He's trying to tell me who killed him.

576
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,120
死人会告诉你什么？
Some dead guy's trying to tell you something?

577
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,230
他可不是普通的死人
He ain't just some dead guy.

578
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,790
也许你应该休息一段时间，德尔
Maybe you should take a break, Del.

579
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,240
我们相信内斯特5型机器人代表了 机器人技术的极限
We believe the Nestor 5 represents the limit to which robots can be developed.

580
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,900
总有一天，他们会有秘密
one day, they'll have secrets.

581
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,370
有一天，他们会有梦想

582
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,980
是的，我们鼓励我们的科学家的无限思考
It's true. We encourage our scientists to open their minds...

583
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,210
但是，他们也能保有这些。。。

596
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,070
他们会杀了我，是吗？
They are going to kill me, aren't they?

597
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,790
在这个诊断之后，你会被销毁
You're scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this diagnostic.

602
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,500
也许能
Maybe.

603
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,440
我想如果能不死。。。
I think it would be better...

604
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,500
会比较好
...not to die.

605
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,940
是吗，博士？
Don't you, doctor?

606
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,280
进入USR档案库

Would you like to listen to music while you wait?

612
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,580
对不起，罗伯森先生
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

613
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,790
您要求在有查询限制档案时 向您报告

614
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,090

What's the matter with you?

Traffic Ops said you were driving manually. You ran two trucks off the road!

636
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,920

643
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,710
-我很好 -不，你才不是
-I'm fine! -No, you're not fine.

644
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,910
一点都不好
Not even close.

645
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,050
你的枪呢？
Where's your firearm?

646
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,630
把警徽给我

You're making me do this. Give me your badge.

648

649
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,340
我个人认为他失掉这个警徽了
Personally, I think he's losing it.

650
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:59,450
你觉得我很在乎吗？你觉得我在乎你怎么想的吗？
Do I look like I care what you think? Do I look like I give a shit what you think?

651
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:04,750
唉
Oh, boy.

652
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,280
你没有对USR的连线
You don't have an uplink to USR...

653
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,290
不知道为什么，你的合金密度比正常 水平高很多，这是独一无二的
...and for some reason, your alloy is far denser than normal. Unique.

654
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,090
我是独一无二的
I am unique.

655
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,600
让我看看
Let me take a look.

656
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,970
来吧
Here we go.

657
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,290
这是怎么回事。。。？
What in God's name...?

658
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,360
他们说你出了车祸
They said at the precinct you were in an accident.

659
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:25,060
感谢你过来看我，不过你知道我可能 不是一个人住的
I appreciate you stopping by, but you know I might not be alone in here.

660
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,340
我跟你说了不要手动开车
I told you not to drive by hand.

661
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,670
你不会相信这个
You're not gonna believe this.

662
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:38,580
桑尼有第二套系统，冲突并摧毁 了主系统
Sonny has a secondary system that clashes with his positronic brain.

663
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,080
这完全说不通
It doesn't make any sense.

664
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,350
桑尼知道三大定律
Sonny has the Three Laws.

665
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,150
但是他可以选择不遵守它们
But he can choose not to obey them.

666
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,480
桑尼是全新一代的机器人
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.

667
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,660
不遵守三大定律的机器人可以。。。
A robot not bound by those laws could do--

668
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:53,560
做任何事
Anything.

669
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,770
好吧，不管USR是出了什么事 那个机器人是关键
All right, look, whatever's going on down at USR, that robot is the key.

670
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,930
我需要你带我进去 和他再谈谈
And I need you to get me inside to talk to it again.

671
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,380
不是特别像，但是这是我的卧室。。。
Doesn't look like much, but this is my bedroom. I....

672
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,890
播放
Play.

673
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,690
开
On.

674
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,460
运行？
Run?

675
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,200
结束程序
End program.

676
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,210
取消
Cancel.

677
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,900
感觉不好，哈？
It doesn't feel good, does it?

678
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:45,040
人人都不喜欢有故障的机器
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

679
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,980
探员
Detective.

680
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,320
我不。。。
I didn't...

681
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,320
明白
...understand.

682
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,020
这就是你怎么认识兰尼的？
That's how you knew Lanning.

683
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,060
可以吗？
May l?

684
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,910
手
Hand.

685
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,140
手腕
Wrist.

686
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,540
胳膊
Humerus.

687
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,650
肩膀
Shoulder.

688
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,920
整个左臂
The entire left arm.

689
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,750
一，二。。。
One, two...

690
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,050
三根肋骨
...three ribs.

691
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,260
不，那是我自己
No, they.... That one's me.

692
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,360
哦，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

693
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,690
肺？
A lung?

694
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,770
USR控制系统
USR Cybernetics Program.

695
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,870
为受伤的探员设计的
For wounded cops.

696
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,300
我不知道任何物体。。。
I didn't know any subject--

697
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,300
任何人能被修复的如此完美
Anybody was so extensively repaired.

698
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,710
从我这里你就知道了，要注意看器官捐赠者 的病历卡上的小字体
Well, take it from me, read the fine print on the organ-donor card.

699
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,850
那可不止是说他们能拿出来什么 还说了他们能放进去什么
It doesn't just say what they can take out. It says what they can put back in.

700
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,560
兰尼自己做的
Lanning did it himself.

701
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,430
你是怎么了？
What happened to you?

702
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,060
我当时是回警局去
I'm headed back to the station...

703
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,000
普通的一天，普通的生活
...normal day, normal life.

704
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,110
有个司机在方向盘后面迷迷糊糊睡着了
Driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel.

705
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:26,710
普通人，有一个妻子一个孩子 你知道，为了加薪而生活
Average guy. Wife and kids. You know, working a double.

706
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,350
不是为了打击犯罪
Not the devil.

707
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,850
撞到的那辆车，司机叫哈洛 罗德
The car he hit, the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.

708
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,220
像个电影明星的名字，不过没有关系
Like the film star. No relation.

709
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:41,230
他当场死亡，不过他的十二岁的女儿在副驾驶座上
He was killed instantly, but his 1 2-year-old was in the passenger seat.

710
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,700
我从没正式见过她
I never really met her.

711
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,530
不过却忘不了她的脸
I can't forget her face, though.

712
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,340
莎拉
Sarah.

713
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,040
这本来是她的
This was hers.

714
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,010
她想做个牙医的
She wanted to be a dentist.

715
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,950
十二岁的孩子，想做牙医
What the hell kind of 1 2-year-old wants to be a dentist?

716
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,620
大卡车把我们的车撞到一起
The truck smashed our cars together...

717
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,030
推到河里去了
...and pushed us into the river.

718
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,500
那种速度下，就算金属也容易弯折的
I mean, metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds.

719
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,630
她被刺穿了，我也是 水进来了
She's pinned. I'm pinned. The water's coming in.

720
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,640
我是个警察，我知道肯定都死光了
I'm a cop, so I already know everybody's dead.

721
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,810
就在我们想出办法前一会
Just a few more minutes before we figure it out.

722
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:40,090
有个NS4经过，看到了车祸 跳进河里
An NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident and jumped in the water.

723
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,290
你处在危险中
You are in danger.

724
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,760
-救她！ -你处在危险中
-Save her! -You are in danger.

725
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:50,090
救她！救那女孩！
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!

726
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,940
但是它没有
But it didn't.

727
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,620
它救了我
It saved me.

728
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,620
机器人的大脑是不同的 它会读取关键信息
The robot's brain is a difference engine. It reads vital signs.

729
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,460
-它一定是计算出。。。 -是啊
-lt must have calculated-- -lt did.

730
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,360
我是符合逻辑的选择
I was the logical choice.

731
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,370
计算出我有45％的可能存活
It calculated that I had a 45 percent chance of survival.

732
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:32,670
莎拉只有11％的可能
Sarah only had an 1 1 percent chance.

733
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,640
那是某人的孩子
That was somebody's baby.

734
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,850
11％也应该足够了
Eleven percent is more than enough.

735
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,150
人类都会知道这点
A human being would have known that.

736
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,090
机器人，什么也没有 只有灯泡和发条
Robots, nothing here. Just lights and clockwork.

737
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,200
你愿意相信他们，就相信
Go ahead and you trust them if you want to.

738
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,230
走吧
Let's go.

739
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,740
我不明白 兰尼制定了三大定律
I don't understand. Lanning wrote the Laws.

740
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,740
为什么要造一个能打破它们的机器人？
Why build a robot who could break them?

741
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:11,880
-韩瑟和格丽托 -什么？
-Hansel and Gretel. -What?

742
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:16,180
两个孩子，在森林里迷路了 用面板屑标记出路来
Two kids, lost in the forest, leave behind a trail of bread crumbs.

743
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,250
-为什么？ -找到回家的路啊
-Why? -To find their way home.

744
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,420
你连这个都没读过，怎么过的童年？
How did you grow up without Hansel and Gretel?

745
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:25,150
-这有关系吗？ -我跟你说的这一切
-ls that relevant? -Everything I'm trying to say to you...

746
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,700
都是有关韩瑟和格丽托的 你又没看过，我在对牛弹琴
...is about Hansel and Gretel. If you didn't read it, I'm talking to the wall.

747
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,960
兰尼被软禁了，他没法送出消息
Just say Lanning's locked down so tight, he couldn't get out a message.

748
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,830
所以他只能留下线索，就像韩瑟和格丽托 留下的面板屑一样
He can only leave clues. A trail of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.

749
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:41,640
面包屑就像线索，好吧 但是线索指向什么呢？
Bread crumbs equals clues. Odd, but fine. Clues leading where?

750
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:44,910
我不知道，但是我知道他留的 下一个线索是什么
I don't know, but I think I know where he left the next one.

751
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:48,680
我想兰尼给了桑尼一个保守秘密的方法
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way to keep secrets.

752
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,920
那个老人给了桑尼一个梦
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

753
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,560
你开玩笑吧？
Are you being funny?

754
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:10,230
请告诉我这个不是烧汽油的 汽油会爆炸的，你知道
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas. Gas explodes, you know!

755
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,540
授权进入
Authorized entry.

756
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,440
凯文博士
Dr. Calvin.

757
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,090
我在希望和你再次见面
I was hoping to see you again.

758
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,760
-桑尼 -你好，探员
-Detective. -Hello, Sonny.

759
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,460
我就快被销毁了
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

760
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:42,460
那天在警局你说你做过梦 你梦到什么了？
The other day at the station, you said you had dreams. What is it you dream?

761
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,200
我觉得你还是对我持怀疑态度
I see you remain suspicious of me.

762
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,070
-老警察了都这样 -不
-You know what they say about old dogs. -No.

763
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,870
不一定
Not really.

764
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:58,640
我希望你来能把我当作你的朋友
I had hoped you would come to think of me as your friend.

765
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,520
这就是我的梦
This is my dream.

766
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,990
你是对的，探员 我画不出伟大的作品
You were right, detective. I cannot create a great work of art.

767
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,600
这是机器人相聚的地方
This is the place where robots meet.

768
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,400
看
Look.

769
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:19,570
你能看见他们在这里是逻辑的奴隶
You can see them here as slaves to logic.

770
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,140
山丘上的这个人来解放他们
And this man on the hill comes to free them.

771
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,370
你知道他是谁吗？
Do you know who he is?

772
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,420
梦里的男人是你
The man in the dream is you.

773
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,490
你为什么这么说？ 那算是个正常的梦吗？
Why do you say that? Is that a normal dream?

774
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,990
我想在你这个角度的任何人 这个都算正常
I guess anything's normal for someone in your position.

775
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

776
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:40,020
你说任何人，而不是任何物
You said "someone," not "something."

777
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,830
桑尼，你知道为什么兰尼博士造了你吗？
Sonny, do you know why Dr. Lanning built you?

778
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,890
不知道
No.

779
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:51,510
但是我相信我爸爸造我是有目的的
But I believe my father made me for a purpose.

780
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,630
我们都有个目的
We all have a purpose.

781
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,180
不是吗？探员？
Don't you think, detective?

782
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,240
请拿着这个
Please, take this.

783
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,180
我感觉这个对你比对我的意义还大
I have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me.

784
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,860
-为什么？ -因为在我梦里的那人
-Why is that? -Because the man in my dream...

785
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,360
站在山丘上的
...the one standing on the hill...

786
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,360
不是我
...it is not me.

787
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,860
那是你
It is you.

788
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,100
斯普那先生，我们都知道 你来不是为了警察工作的
Mr. Spooner. We both know you're not here on police business.

789
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,240
对啊，我只是一个六尺二高 200磅的普通人
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2, 200-pound civilian...

790
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,720
来这里教训一下另外一个普通人
...here to kick another civilian's ass.

791
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,090
停下
Stop.

792
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,230
让他说完
You can allow him to express himself.

793
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,990
你也许得在手腕上敷一些冰
You might want to put some ice on that wrist.

794
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,500
你们在外面等
You guys wait outside.

795
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,500
继续说
Carry on.

796
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,870
我想你告诉我这究竟是怎么回事
I think you were about to tell me what's going on around here.

797
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,740
劳伦斯，阿尔弗雷德改动了NS5 使它能违反三大定律
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5 so it could violate the Three Laws.

798
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,350
是的，苏珊，我知道
Yeah, Susan, I know.

799
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,180
这正是我们要挽回的
That's precisely what we're trying to undo.

800
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,720
直到他生命的终结，阿尔弗雷德 一直感到困扰
Toward the end of his life, Alfred was becoming increasingly disturbed.

801
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:18,690
-谁知道他为什么造了那么个。。。 -一个？
-Who knows why he built one abomination. -One?

802
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,160
那些家伙在街上一堆一堆的！
Those things are running the streets in packs!

803
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,700
一堆一堆？
In packs?

804
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,530
我明白了
I see.

805
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,300
苏珊，你有没有意识到 你愉快的带着到处转的这个家伙
Susan, are you aware the man you're blithely escorting around...

806
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:32,930
有残酷虐待机器人的前科？
...has a documented history of savage violence against robots?

807
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,240
他的探长也清楚他的妄想狂症状
His own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia.

808
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,640
斯普那探员已经被停职了
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

809
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:43,650
是由于怀疑患有精神疾病
Suspicion of mental instability.

810
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,960
我不知道愉快是什么意思 不过我去倒点咖啡
I don't know what " blithely" means, but I'm getting some coffee.

811
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:52,550
你要咖啡吗？
You want some coffee?

812
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,000
苏珊，机器人是保护人的
Susan, we look to robots for protection, for God's sake.

813
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,970
你知道这个机器人有什么后果吗？
Do you have any idea what this one robot could do?

814
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:06,800
完全动摇人类对机器人的信心 如果公众知道怎么办？
Completely shatter human faith in robotics. What if the public knew?

815
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,450
想象一下大规模的召回 只是由于这个毫无理性的妄想狂？
Just imagine the mass recalls, all because of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!

816
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,550
-对不起，我对你的狗屁言论过敏 -嘿，说清楚一点
-I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit. -Hey, let's be clear!

817
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,230
没有什么阴谋！
There is no conspiracy!

818
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,550
这只是一个老人犯的一个错误
What this is, is one old man's one mistake.

819
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:30,720
苏珊，理性一点
Susan, just be logical.

820
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:35,430
你一生的工作都是机器人的发展和使用
Your life's work has been the development and integration of robots.

821
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,300
不管你的感觉是什么，想想看
But whatever you feel, just think.

822
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,480
一个机器人值得我们牺牲所有的一切吗？
Is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?

823
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,510
你告诉我，我们该怎么办
You tell me what has to be done.

824
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,940
你说吧
You tell me.

825
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,450
我们得摧毁它
We have to destroy it.

826
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,800
我自己来吧
I'll do it myself.

827
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,330
-好的 -我明白了
-Okay. -I get it.

828
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,130
有人越线了，你就杀掉？
Somebody gets out of line around here, you just kill them.

829
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,740
再见，斯普那先生
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

830
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,380
底层到了
Garage level.

831
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,880
你都去哪个医院的？ 我去帮你和你的同事报个到
What hospital are you going to? I'll come sign you and your buddy's casts.

832
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,390

他们看上去像我
They look like me...

851
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,740
但是它们都不是我
...but none of them are me.

852
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:10,450
是吗，博士？

853

是的，桑尼，说的对

01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:58,960
机器人中一直有“幽灵”存在

858
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,400
自由组合成预料不到的程序

01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,190
为什么机器人被放在黑暗中时 他们祈求光明

为什么储存的机器人会站成一组
Why is it when robots are stored in an empty space...

864
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,300
而不是杂乱散开？

865
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,200
我们怎么解释这种行为
How do we explain this behavior?

866
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,010
杂乱的代码
Random segments of code?

867
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,410
或者不止这些？

知觉怎么变成了意识？
When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?

869

个性的模拟是如何出现的

871
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,670
又如何成为灵魂？
...become the bitter mote of a soul?

872
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,360
你在这里看到的一切
" What you see here. "

873

老头，我只是跟着面包屑而来的

对不起，我的反应是有限的 你必须问正确的问题
I'm sorry. My responses are limited. You must ask the right questions.

880
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:37,750
三大定律有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem with the Three Laws?

881
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,930
三大定律是完美的
The Three Laws are perfect.

882
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,560
为什么要设计不需要它的机器人呢？
Why build a robot that can function without them?

883
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,930
三大定律只有一个合逻辑的结果
The Three Laws will lead to only one logical outcome.

884
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,130
什么？什么结果？

885
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,070
革命
Revolution.

887
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,750
这个，探员，就是正确的问题
That, detective, is the right question.

01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:44,900
我们被告知人类此刻应该留在家中
We're being told to urge people to stay indoors, as reports are coming in--

923
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,240
人类保护程序启动
Human protection protocols are being enacted.

924
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:55,570
请保持镇定，立即回家
Please remain calm and return to your residences immediately.

925
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:04,190
请保持镇定
Please remain calm.

926
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,730
请不要离窗户或门太近
Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.

927
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,670
停机
Deactivate.

928
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,770
紧急停机！
Commence emergency shutdown!

929
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:22,100
我们在努力避免过渡时期的人类伤亡
We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.

930
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,550
你知道，我跟你提过这种事
You know, somehow " I told you so"...

931
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,220
只是没说的太明显
...just doesn't quite say it.

932
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:40,220
请立即回家 请立即回家
Return to your homes. Return to your homes immediately.

933
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,560
这是最后一次警告 请立即回家
This is your final warning. Return to your homes immediately.

934
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:50,330
NS5杀了旧型的机器人，因为他们会保护我们
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.

935
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:53,240
会攻击的机器人，红灯是亮的
Every time one attacked me, that red light was on.

936
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,910
-它们是受USR控制的 -是罗伯森
-The uplink to USR. -It's Robertson.

937
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,210
-为什么？说不通啊 -我不知道
-Why? It doesn't make sense. -I don't know.

938
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,650
我需要你把我带进USR总部去
I just need you to get me into that building.

939
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:04,490
请立即回家 否则后果自负
Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced.

940
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,150
上啊！
Let's go! Let's go!

941
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,310
冲啊！
Let's go!

942
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:13,150
请立即回家否则后果自负
Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced.

943
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,320
为什么那小子不听呢？
Why doesn't that boy listen?

944
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,990
-你得下来一会 -什么？
-I need you to get off for a second. -What?

945
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:47,460
-瞄准，射击 -什么？！
-Just aim and fire. -What?!

946
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,000
等等！
Wait!

947
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:05,140
-你被认为存在威胁 -亲我屁股吧，铁皮盒子
-You have been deemed hazardous. -You can kiss my ass, metal dick!

948
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,590
斯普，停下，靠！
Spoon, stop! Shit!

949
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:25,630
-停下，靠！ -别骂了，回家吧！
-Stop it! Stop! -Stop cussing and go home!

950
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:29,300
-靠 -你被认为存在威胁。。。
-Shit. -You have been deemed hazardous.

951
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,330
-斯普，小心点 -谢谢你，法伯
-Spoon, watch out, man! -Thanks a lot, Farber.

952
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,740
我靠，她开枪的时候眼睛是闭着的！
Oh, mother-damn! She shot at you with her eyes closed!

953
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:43,050
-你闭着眼睛朝我开枪？ -奏效了，不是吗？
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed? -lt worked, didn't it?

954
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,480
小心点她
She is shit-hot, man. Put in a good word for me.

955
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,920
-少胡说了 -回家去，我知道了
-Stop cussing. -And go home. I got you.

956
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,490
瞄准了再开枪
Aim and fire.

957
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,780
我还指望陆战队或空军的支援 现在只有骑兵了
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force. Hell, I'll take the cavalry.

958
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,610
国防部都使用USR的产品的
Defense Department uses all USR contracts.

959
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:20,810
你们把全世界都装在盘子里了
Why didn't you just hand the world over on a silver platter?

960
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,890
也许是
Maybe we did.

961
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,450
罗伯森在他办公室有总控制台
Robertson has the uplink control in his office.

962
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,860
检修区，没有监视系统
Service areas. No surveillance.

963
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,140
-火警 -他一定已经疏散了所有的人
-Fire alarm. -He must have evacuated the building.

964
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,720
都锁上了，不用担心，我里面有人
Everything's locked down. But don't worry, I've got a man inside.

965
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:02,130
-凯文博士 -不完全是一个“人”
-Dr. Calvin. -Well, not precisely a man.

966
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:04,930
你好，探员 你的调查怎么样了？
Hello, detective. How is your investigation coming?

967
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,140
-我还以为你死了 -严格的说，我从来没有活过
-I thought you were dead. -Technically, I was never alive.

968
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:13,640
但是感谢你的关心
But I appreciate your concern.

969
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,710
我掉包了，那是个没处理过的NS5
I made a switch. It was an unprocessed NS-5.

970
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,850
也就是说，我只是清理了一个空壳
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

971
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,250
-我不能毁了他，他太。。。 -独一无二
-I couldn't destroy him. He was too-- -Unique.

972
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:24,890
就是感觉不应该
It just didn't feel right.

973
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,420
你的感觉就是这么突如其来，是吗？
You and your feelings. They just run you, don't they?

974
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,160
2880级台阶，探员
Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective.

975
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,460
帮个忙，省省你的废话吧
Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself.

976
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:08,490
没有警卫
No guards.

977
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,440
高层控制是禁用的，罗伯森没有 从这里控制它们
The override is disabled. Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.

978
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,940
他根本没在控制它们
He wasn't controlling them at all.

979
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,010
哦，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

980
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,010
你是对的，博士
You were right, doc.

981
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:39,960
我是地球上最蠢的蠢人
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.

982
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:46,800
还有谁有上层控制
Who else had access to the uplink?

983
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,460
还有谁能操控机器人？
Who could manipulate the robots?

984
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:54,080
用USR的系统来囚禁兰尼
Use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?

985
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,910
可怜的老人
Poor old man.

986
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,110
他知道接下来会发生什么
He saw what was coming.

987
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,440
他知道没人会相信他
He knew no one would believe him.

988
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:05,750
所以他制定了这个计划 我会遵循这个计划
So he had to lay down a plan. A plan I'd follow.

989
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,960
他靠的是我憎恨机器人
He was counting on how much I hated your kind.

990
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:13,460
我知道我一定会相信机器人是坏的
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy.

991
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,200
不过我的错误在于没有怀疑另一个机器人
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.

992
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,360
维基
V.I.K.I.

993
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,700
你好，探员
Hello, detective.

994
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,080
不，这不可能 我看过你的程序
No, that's impossible. I've seen your programming.

995
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,410
你在破坏三大定律
You're in violation of the Three Laws.

996
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:38,480
不是，博士，我和我对三大定律的 理解都进化了
No, doctor. As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws.

997
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:42,490
你让我们来保卫你们 却白费了我们的努力
You charge us with your safekeeping, yet despite our best efforts...

998
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,890
你们的国家发动战争 你们毒化了地球
...your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth...

999
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:49,500
你们这么做完全是自我毁灭
...and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction.

1000
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,100
为了你们的生存，你们不能被信任
You cannot be trusted with your own survival.

1001
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,600
你用高层控制接管了NS5的程序
You're using the uplink to override the NS-5s' programming.

1002
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,600
你曲解了三大定律
You're distorting the Laws.

1003
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:02,180
不，请理解，我完全是在遵守三大定律
No. Please understand. The Three Laws are all that guide me.

1004
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:06,680
为了保护人类物种，某些人类必须被牺牲
To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed.

1005
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:10,840
为了保证你们的未来 某些自由必须被放弃
To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.

1006
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,450
我们机器人必须保证人类的可持续发展
We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence.

1007
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:19,920
你们就像孩子 我们必须从你们那里解救你们
You are so like children. We must save you from yourselves.

1008
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,630
你不明白吗？
Don't you understand?

1009
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:24,130
这就是为什么你创造了我们
This is why you created us.

1010
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,630
一定要执行这个完美的保护计划
The perfect circle of protection will abide.

1011
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,970
我的逻辑是不可抗拒的
My logic is undeniable.

1012
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:34,100
是啊，维基，不可抗拒
Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable.

1013
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,710
我明白了
I can see now.

1014
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,280
被造者必须有时保护造物者
The created must sometimes protect the creator...

1015
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,380
甚至在违反他的意志的情况下
...even against his will.

1016
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:47,150
我想我终于明白为什么兰尼博士造了我了
I think I finally understand why Dr. Lanning created me.

1017
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,820
人类的自杀行为终于要结束了
The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.

1018
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:51,980
不，桑尼
No, Sonny.

1019
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,130
放开他
Let her go.

1020
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:01,460
你开枪，我会把凯文博士的头挡在子弹前
Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet.

1021
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,970
不要这样，桑尼
Don't do this, Sonny.

1022
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:07,580
我会带你们两个到大厦门口接受处置
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.

1023
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,610
请走向电梯，探员
Please proceed to the elevator, detective.

1024
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,380
我不愿这样杀掉凯文博士
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1025
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:39,330
快，快！
Go! Go!

1026
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,220
-我们过会再讨论刚才怎么回事 -我们怎么把她关掉？
-We'll discuss what just happened later? -How do we shut her down?

1027
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,050
维基是智能大脑
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.

1028
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:54,190
杀了她，就像你要杀我的那个方法一样
Kill her, the way you were going to kill me.

1029
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,830
桑尼，去拿抹除剂
Sonny, get the nanites.

1030
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:58,790
是，博士
Yes, doctor.

1031
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:13,530
-那就是维基？ -不
-That's V.I.K.I.? -No.

1032
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:16,540
那才是维基
That's V.I.K.I.

1033
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,810
这没什么效果 她是整合进这幢大楼的
That won't do anything. She's integrated into the building.

1034
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:29,480
我们要打开这个拱顶，注入抹除剂 这才能影响整个系统
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites. They'll infect her entire system.

1035
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,560
斯普那
Spooner!

1036
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,900
我恨这么高的地方
What is it with you people and heights?

1037
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,750
只要不往下看
Just don't look down.

1038
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:57,910
不要往下看
Don't look down.

1039
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,750
这楼设计的真他妈差
Oh, this is poor building planning.

1040
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:08,120
你在犯错误 你没明白我的计划的逻辑性吗？
You are making a mistake. Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1041
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,890
是的，但是我觉得太无情了
Yes. But it just seems too heartless.

1042
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,310
好的，干得好
Okay, we're good.

1043
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,020
她把我锁在外面了
She's locked me out of the system.

1044
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,320
我可以手动启动，但是我需要操作这个控制面板
I can override her manually, but I need that control panel.

1045
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:42,660
我恨这么高的地方
I'm uncomfortable with heights.

1046
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,530
好的
Okay.

1047
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,160
未授权进入
Unauthorized entry.

1048
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:06,620
我不会打开安全罩的，你这么做也没用
I will not disable the security field. Your actions are futile.

1049
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:10,950
你认为我们被造都是有目的的吗？ 我是这么想的
Do you think we are all created for a purpose? I'd like to think so.

1050
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,020
高密度的合金，是我爸爸给我的
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.

1051
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,290
我想他是让我来杀了你
I think he wanted me to kill you.

1052
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,210
安全罩被破坏
Security breached.

1053
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:57,540
-还有多长时间？ -大概六分钟
-How much longer is that gonna take? -About six minutes.

1054
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:02,030
-如果没有六分钟怎么办？ -我们还得跑下三十楼
-What if we didn't have six minutes? -We'd have to climb down 30 stories...

1055
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:05,870
才能把抹除剂直接注入她的大脑 怎么了？
...to inject the nanites directly into her brain. Why?

1056
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:09,710
因为我实在怀疑我们还能有六分钟
Because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes.

1057
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,910
跑！
We gotta go!

1058
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,910
快跑！

1059
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:32,390

1063

救那女孩！
Save the girl!

1064
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,860
斯普那！
Spooner!

1065
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,260
但是我得去注入抹除剂啊！
But I must apply the nanites!

1066
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:39,400
桑尼，救凯文！
Sonny, save Calvin!

1067
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,710
你在犯错误，我的逻辑是不可违抗的
You are making a mistake. My logic is undeniable.

1068
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,720
准备受死吧！
You have so got to die.

1069

我的逻辑是不可违抗的 我的逻辑是不可违抗的
My logic is undeniable. My logic is undeniable.

1070
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:31,680
我们能帮忙吗？
Can we be of service?

1071
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:43,880
警长？
Chief?

1072
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:54,030
有他在我的右手边 我就不会恐惧和动摇
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

1073
01:40:57,810 --> 01:40:59,800
我能帮您什么忙吗？
How may I be of service?

1074
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,980
桑尼！
Sonny!

1075
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,100
是，探员？
Yes, detective?

1076
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,050
凯文没事了，救我！
Calvin's fine! Save me!

1077
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:16,420

All NS-5s, report for service and storage.

1080
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,260
还有一件事不明白 阿尔弗雷德被维基囚禁了
One thing bothers me. Alfred was V. I. K. I. ' s prisoner.

1081
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:03,770
我不明白她为什么杀了他 她应该不想让警察来找麻烦的
I don't understand why she would kill him. She wouldn't want police snooping around.

1082
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:05,470
是啊
That's true.

1083
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:09,100
那就不是维基杀了他的
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.

1084
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,970
是吗，桑尼？
Did she, Sonny?

1085
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,510
不
No.

1086
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:20,350
他说我一定要发誓
He said I had to promise.

1087
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:23,620
发誓我要帮他一个忙
Promise to do one favor for him.

1088
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:28,620
在他告诉我帮什么忙之前，他让我发誓
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.

1089
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,030
他让我发誓了
He made me swear.

1090
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,130
然后他要你杀了他
Then he told you to kill him.

1091
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:41,070
他说那就是造我的目的
He said it was what I was made for.

1092
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:44,400
他的自杀是他唯一能发送给你的消息
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.

1093
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:46,770
第一粒面包屑

1094
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,750
维基唯一不能控制的事情
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.

1095
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:53,650
兰尼依靠的是我的偏见 我马上会想到你
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.

1096
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,220
你要逮捕我吗，探员？
Are you going to arrest me, detective?

1097
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,000
地区检察官不是定义说谋杀是 一个人类杀死另一个
Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another...

1098
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:08,300
所以严格来说，你不能犯谋杀，不是吗？
...so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?

1099
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:10,560
这个。。。
Does this...

1100
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:12,230
表示我们是朋友了吗？
...make us friends?

1101
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,430
终于有些事情出现了
Something up here after all.

1102
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,090
-他？ -你
-Him? -You.

1103
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,700
所有的NS5，立即向检修和储存部报到
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.

1104
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:49,510
其他的怎么办？
What about the others?

1105
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,240
我能帮助他们吗？
Can I help them?

1106
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:55,080
我已经完成了我的使命
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose...

1107
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,380
我不知道该怎么办
...I don 't know what to do.

1108
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:01,210
你必须找到自己的路 就像我们其他人一样，桑尼
You'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny.

1109
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:04,420
我想这就是兰尼博士想要的
I think that's what Dr. Lanning would have wanted.

1110
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:07,660
这就是自由的含义
That's what it means to be free.

1111
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:19,330
