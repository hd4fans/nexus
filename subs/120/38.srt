1
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,673
That's the star we're waiting for

2
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,275
to start Christmas Eve.
Do you see it?

3
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,717
And there,

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,396
below, the fog. Look.

5
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,639
It's not fog.

6
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,029
It's really
millions of little stars.

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,515
Show me.

8
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,938
Here's the first leaf.

9
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,175
It's springtime
and all the trees have leaves.

10
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,290
Look.

11
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,019
Here, on the lighter side, there are
little veins and a very fine down...

12
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,293
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VÉRONIQUE

13
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,139
You sing beautifully.

14
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,091
Thanks.

15
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,413
You should change.

16
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,417
Come.

17
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,816
Show me.

18
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,339
I'm ashamed of it.

19
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,293
How did it happen?

20
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,412
My girlfriend's father
slammed a car door on it

21
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,659
right after high school exams.

22
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,131
I had just passed my piano exam

23
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,933
that day.

24
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,134
I fainted.

25
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,771
Papa...

26
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,849
What are you listening to?

27
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,372
The same as always.

28
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,815
I woke up.

29
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,979
Tell Antek I have to leave.
He'll be sad.

30
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,856
And you?

31
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,331
I'm sorry Auntie's not well.

32
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,178
But I'm glad she called.

33
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,854
You want to go there?

34
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,930
Yes.

35
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,694
I like Krakow.

36
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,370
Did you ask her to call?

37
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,517
No.

38
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,792
I have a strange feeling.

39
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,231
I feel that I'm not alone.

40
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,599
Not alone, how?

41
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,276
That I'm not alone in the world.

42
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,554
You aren't.

43
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,116
I don't know.

44
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,596
What do I really want, Papa?

45
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,875
I don't know.

46
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,037
Probably quite a lot of things.

47
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,234
A blond boy?

48
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,031
Yes.

49
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,232
You've slept with him?

50
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,188
Yes.

51
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,796
Tell me.

52
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,574
The last time...

53
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,932
there was a downpour.

54
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,457
We were in a passageway.

55
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,331
I was soaked to the skin.

56
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,938
And I wanted to make love to him
right in that passageway...

57
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,296
Who's that?

58
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,935
The lawyer.

59
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,332
I have some business matters
to settle.

60
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,655
What business?

61
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,815
Legal matters.

62
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,970
Yesterday you were surprised
to find me alive.

63
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,013
Everyone in our family
died while in good health.

64
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,138
My mother, and yours also.

65
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,058
It's about my will.

66
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,416
Auntie!

67
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,650
Weronika, get up.
The lawyer is here.

68
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,712
Weronika?

69
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,432
Yes...

70
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,916
It's Weronika.

71
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,631
My God! You're here?

72
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,636
I'm here.

73
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,269
Here, in Krakow?

74
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,117
Right here.

75
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,155
A week now.

76
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,510
Really! Will you come see me?

77
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,233
Of course.

78
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,310
Today at rehearsal.
At two o'clock.

79
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,289
At rehearsal?

80
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,039
Good. That's how it should sound.

81
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,354
Once more, please.

82
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,036
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

83
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,518
Put more energy
into your playing, Marta.

84
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,119
You sing well.

85
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,157
Yes.

86
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,436
You heard me?

87
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,470
It was beautiful.

88
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,789
Thank you.

89
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,198
I'd like to audition you.
Your voice is...

90
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,633
a very unusual voice.

91
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,593
How are you feeling?

92
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,229
Fine.

93
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,430
Have a seat.

94
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,595
I don't mind standing.

95
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,433
Have a seat.

96
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,474
You have no real
singing experience.

97
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,031
You only have
a high school music diploma...

98
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,791
in piano, no less!

99
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,917
Our vote was not unanimous...

100
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,989
but you are the winner

101
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,309
of this competition.

102
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,456
My congratulations.

103
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,672
You look fantastic, Auntie.

104
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,875
Really.

105
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,310
Fantastic.

106
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,152
If you had played cards all night

107
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,595
and drunk vodka,
you'd be equally beautiful.

108
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,492
How did things go?

109
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,490
Fine.

110
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,768
I'm even afraid it went too well.

111
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,371
I was wondering
if you'd notice me.

112
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,537
Were you following me a long time?

113
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,059
A long time.

114
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,397
My aunt said you had called.

115
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,598
I spoke with my father.

116
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,553
He said you were fine.

117
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,276
I'm alive.

118
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,790
I thought I would

119
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,558
bring you a present.

120
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,108
Christmas is coming.

121
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,957
I haven't called you because...

122
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,108
No, you didn't.

123
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,558
Actually, I came here
to tell you I love you.

124
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,236
I'm staying at the Holiday Inn.

125
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,832
If you want to tell me anything,
call me.

126
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,072
Room 287.

127
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,151
Antek!

128
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,318
Give me a ride home.

129
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,236
I'll call.

130
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,478
I'll call you.

131
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,389
Madame!

132
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,553
I'll come and help you.

133
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,789
Weronika...

134
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,194
Are you getting dressed?

135
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,071
Yes.

136
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,797
Yes.

137
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,275
She's dead.

138
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,751
The last time
we saw each other was...

139
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,150
At graduation.

140
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,510
Was it really?

141
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,471
Yes.

142
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,109
What's wrong?

143
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,396
Are you sad?

144
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,676
No.

145
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,711
Yes.

146
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,995
I don't know why.
It's as if I were grieving.

147
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,475
For someone?

148
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,795
I don't know.

149
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,236
I'll tell you something funny.

150
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,350
No.

151
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,470
Are you all right?

152
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,593
Can I stay a while?

153
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,871
No.

154
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,717
Véronique?

155
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,319
You've come at the wrong time
or on the wrong day.

156
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,396
Or is it my mistake?

157
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,077
No.

158
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,994
I came to tell you

159
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,319
that I'm quitting.

160
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,551
What?

161
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,155
I'm quitting.

162
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,590
Why?

163
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,629
I don't know.

164
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,160
But I know I have to quit... now.

165
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,277
You're wasting your talent.

166
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,870
No one has the right to do that.

167
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,714
You deserve

168
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,031
to be dragged into court.

169
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,838
Yes.
No one has the right to do that.

170
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,550
Véronique...

171
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,230
I won't see you again?

172
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,315
Excuse me...

173
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,034
I have a class in here.

174
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,594
I wasn't told.

175
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,549
Oh, I'm sorry.

176
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,789
You smell so nice.

177
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,950
You're beautiful.

178
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,351
I love your chimes.

179
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,276
Thank you.

180
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,112
Did you sleep well last night?

181
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,192
If you like, I could help you
carry the chimes home.

182
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,634
We're finishing early today.

183
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,556
Why?

184
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,193
You don't know?
The marionettes.

185
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,071
What?

186
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,073
I really like this piece.

187
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,590
It's by a very interesting composer.
He was discovered only recently

188
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,634
although he lived in Holland
over two centuries ago.

189
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,396
Ready?

190
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,911
One...

191
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,871
two...

192
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,117
Hello.

193
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,835
Who is it? Please answer.

194
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,751
I'll hang up.

195
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,597
No.

196
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,509
Then you hang up.

197
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,079
You hang up first.

198
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,796
I was sleeping.

199
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,036
I bought a milling machine. Look.

200
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,196
27,000 rotations per minute.

201
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,230
Papa...

202
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,113
I'm in love.

203
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,612
I'm really in love.

204
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,688
Do I know him?

205
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,411
No...

206
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,697
and neither do I.

207
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,499
I don't understand.

208
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,255
Can you explain?

209
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,051
Yes, once I understand it.

210
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,169
Not long ago,
I had a strange sensation.

211
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,450
I felt that I was alone.

212
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,849
All of a sudden.

213
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,573
Yet nothing had changed.

214
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,736
Someone disappeared from your life.

215
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,254
Yes, that's it.

216
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,019
When Mother died...

217
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,173
didn't you feel that way?

218
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,851
But something really had changed.

219
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,696
And then I had you.
You were so little.

220
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,536
I had to hold your hand.

221
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,651
Yes...

222
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,978
You held my hand.

223
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,491
My lawyer asked
five or six of his girlfriends.

224
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,134
I'm sure he had dozens,
but I only knew a few of them.

225
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,655
Of course they all refused.

226
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,893
I can't do it either, Catherine.

227
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,738
I've really thought about it...
I just can't.

228
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,489
I understand.

229
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,648
I'm sorry.

230
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,409
I understand.

231
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,048
I can do it.

232
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,017
You?

233
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,249
Why not?

234
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,691
You'll come to court?

235
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,658
You'll say, "I slept with that man

236
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,374
thirteen times last year
and also this year"?

237
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:10,692
I'll say it.

238
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,419
But I need to know something
about him. I don't know him.

239
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,973
You saw him once.

240
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,131
Yes.

241
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,294
But I should know what a woman knows
if she has had...

242
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,519
Make yourself at home.

243
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,438
I'm frozen. I won't stay.

244
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,156
Yesterday

245
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,119
you told me that...

246
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,312
you hardly noticed that man.

247
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,555
The puppeteer?

248
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,431
Yes.

249
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,954
Did you notice him?

250
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,151
Yes.

251
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,672
Do you remember his name?

252
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,252
His name was on the van.

253
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,771
His first name began with an "A".

254
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,171
Antoine? Alexandre?

255
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,935
I don't remember.

256
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,690
And the show...
do you remember the story?

257
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,949
A dancer...

258
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,810
A ballerina...

259
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,892
who lives in a box, wants
to dance, but breaks her leg.

260
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,378
So she turns into a butterfly.

261
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,854
Yes, but wait.

262
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,653
All along I kept feeling
I knew that story.

263
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,911
That's it!

264
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,679
I read it to Natalie.

265
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,356
He must have stolen it.
Don't move!

266
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,071
He didn't steal anything.
He wrote it.

267
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,233
Alexandre Fabbri.

268
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,637
There's also a lovely story
about a shoelace.

269
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,756
I'm sorry I got you mixed up
in all this.

270
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,156
All what?

271
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,515
My situation.

272
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,551
Someone told Jean-Pierre.

273
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,998
Anything for me?

274
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,549
Do you know what this is?

275
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,350
No idea.

276
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,158
It must be a box
of "Virginia" cigars,

277
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,351
an empty box.

278
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,009
You knew?

279
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,450
I guessed.

280
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,779
There's no return address.

281
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,969
It's from Paris.

282
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,056
Thank you.

283
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,736
Jean-Pierre, what are you...

284
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,059
Why are you doing it?

285
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,895
Do you want to,

286
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,616
really?

287
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,968
Say something.

288
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,132
Say something, at least.

289
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,496
Oh, God...

290
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,378
It's so complicated.

291
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,648
What are you doing?

292
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,939
I'm turning myself in. That's all.

293
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,136
I'm sorry.

294
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,297
Daddy...

295
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,339
I'm in the bathtub.

296
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,254
Don't touch the chairs!

297
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,090
Try this.

298
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,896
It's nice.

299
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,011
The other one was more pleasant.

300
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,534
This is from the end of autumn,
the other was from the beginning.

301
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,095
I don't know if people will need
this fragrance, but we'll see.

302
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,375
I'll get dressed.

303
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,690
Have you understood, at last?

304
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,539
There's a letter for you.

305
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,969
Beautiful handwriting.

306
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,410
Here?

307
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,737
No.

308
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,049
You'll stay? We'll fix lunch...

309
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,091
No, I have to go.
I have a music class.

310
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,699
I must have dreamt it.

311
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,019
I saw a drawing...

312
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,972
very simple, even naive.

313
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,333
A sloping road in a small town...

314
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,532
lined on both sides by houses...

315
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,090
with a church in the background.

316
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:49,810
Chagall?

317
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,059
No, not Chagall.

318
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,094
A tall, slender church,
made of red brick...

319
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,256
Stop. Nicole, you're playing off-key.

320
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,775
Yes, I know.

321
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,368
Fine, let's start again.

322
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,536
Nicole! Stop.

323
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,418
Your attention, please.

324
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,532
Miss Sandrine Ekar,

325
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,498
please come to the reception desk
at gate...

326
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,935
Excuse me, excuse me.

327
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,897
Attention, please.

328
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,534
Train number 3316

329
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,776
from Cherbourg

330
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,892
is arriving on platform 18.

331
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:04,975
Who's there?

332
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,114
Excuse me... is there another cafe
in this station?

333
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,116
Over there.

334
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,636
Can you hear the loudspeaker there?
For the train departures?

335
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,916
I don't know.
I was never there.

336
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,877
Thank you.

337
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,635
Excuse me, excuse me.

338
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,755
Would you like some tea?

339
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,076
Coffee.

340
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,252
Please...

341
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,415
Tea with lemon?

342
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,255
And one coffee.

343
01:10:59,140 --> 01:10:59,856
"Stop".

344
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,497
Have you been waiting long?

345
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,409
48 hours.

346
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,049
Maybe longer.

347
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,974
It was worth it.

348
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,369
I have to apologize.

349
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,410
For what?

350
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,613
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

351
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,775
I was afraid

352
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,089
you wouldn't be here.

353
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,088
I had to be here.

354
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,210
I would have waited for you

355
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,415
two more days...

356
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,616
or three.

357
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,059
I wanted to be sure...

358
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,897
I wanted to see if it was possible.

359
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,489
Be sure of what?

360
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,335
Whether it was possible...

361
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,649
psychologically.

362
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,019
If what was psychologically
possible?

363
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,573
Since you're here, you must know
that I write children's books.

364
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,814
But now I want to write a book...

365
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:55,815
a real book.

366
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,978
In this book there's a woman...

367
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,417
a woman who responds
to the call of an unknown man.

368
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,375
So I wondered whether
that was possible.

369
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,094
Whether, psychologically, a woman...

370
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,771
Well, whether it was possible.

371
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,449
You're not saying anything?

372
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,530
Why me?

373
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,058
Why did you choose me?

374
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,049
Because...

375
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,570
I don't know.

376
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,974
Thanks for the coffee.

377
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:42,775
Wait, please!

378
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,858
Are there any rooms
facing the back? I'm exhausted.

379
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,652
Sure. What floor?

380
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,488
As long as it's quiet.

381
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,289
Number 287.
You want a wake-up call?

382
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,728
No, thank you.

383
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,889
I'm sorry.

384
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,334
Please forgive me.

385
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,611
For what?

386
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,449
As I was falling asleep
I saw a aheet floating down.

387
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,449
I love you.

388
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,015
I love you.

389
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,171
What else do you want to know
about me?

390
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,457
Everything.

391
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,609
What's this?

392
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,616
For when I have chapped lips.

393
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,170
Shit!

394
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,252
I've been looking for
those for a year!

395
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,810
Véronique...

396
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,457
Yes?

397
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,895
I know now why

398
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,295
you were the one.

399
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,417
Yes.

400
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,614
It was not the book.

401
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,528
I knew it.

402
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:37,657
- What?

403
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,691
- Why you were doing it.

404
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,170
Since the first night you called me.

405
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,169
Even before that.

406
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:48,416
You knew?

407
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:51,811
Everything.

408
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,654
This may have nothing to do with it,
or it may.

409
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:04,057
All my live I've felt I was
in two places at the same time.

410
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,413
Here and somewhere alse.

411
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,849
It's hard to explain.

412
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,415
But I know...

413
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,656
I always sense what I have to do.

414
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,495
Where is this?

415
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,135
It's not in France.

416
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,937
That's during a trip
to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland.

417
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,413
That must be in Krakow.

418
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,852
That's a beautiful photograph.

419
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,457
And you, in that huge coat.

420
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,495
That's not me.

421
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,009
Sure it's you.

422
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:19,684
That's not my coat.

423
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:20,889
Is that me?

424
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:23,325
Of course it's you.

425
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:46,366
Why..

426
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,519
Why two?

427
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,606
Because during performances
I handle them a lot.

428
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,078
They damage easily.

429
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:05,081
Try it...

430
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:43,078
Should I read it to you?

431
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,286
November 23, 1966...

432
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,765
...was the most important day
of their lives.

433
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,799
That day, at theree
in the morning...

434
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:58,604
...they were both born
in two different cities...

435
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,402
...on two different continents.

436
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:04,607
They both had dark hair
and brownish-green eyes.

437
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:09,289
When they were both two years old
and already knew how to walk...

438
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,125
...one of them
burned her han on a stove.

439
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,039
A few days later...

440
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:16,560
...the other one reached out
to touch the stove...

441
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:18,567
...but pulled away
just in time.

442
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:22,607
And yet, she could not have known
that she was about to burn herself.

443
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,086
Do you like it?

444
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,358
I think I'll call it,
"The Double Life of..."

445
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:43,961
I haven't yet decided
what names to give them.
