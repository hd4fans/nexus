1
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,812
Open the door! Open the door!

2
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,983
Oh, my gosh, what is the matter?

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,194
- I don't know what happened.  - Are you OK? Erin...

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,792
All right.

5
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,587
There you go, miss. Thank you.

6
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,178
Oh, sorry. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

7
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,513
Are you all right?

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,515
Wait, they're not boarding in there yet.

9
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,566
Come on!

10
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,696
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Have you seen this woman?

11
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,032
- I don't think so.  - Are you sure?

12
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
- Yeah, pretty sure.  - No?

13
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,082
- Dino.  - Yes, sir.

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,419
Guys, have you seen this woman?

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,548
- Isn't she blonde, with short hair maybe?  - Thank you.

16
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,560
Stop the bus! Boston PD.

17
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,908
Excuse me.

18
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,086
Hey! Stop the bus! Open up!

19
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,072
Folks, we'll be stopping for 15 minutes here in Southport.

20
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,166
Do you have any fresh coffee?

21
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,585
It's so thick, it tastes like lukewarm mud.

22
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,171
- I don't know what to tell you, ma'am.  - You're gonna have to throw it out.

23
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,007
- It's a fresh Ethiopian blend.  - It's not...

24
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,927
I've never tasted Ethiopian that tasted like that in my life.

25
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,804
- It's Ethiopian. Yeah.  - It's Ethiopian?

26
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,475
Just the mud for you then?

27
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,979
That'll be 97 cents.

28
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,857
Out of one.

29
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,404
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

30
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,086
And I wish they would, you know, take us to places that...

31
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,329
- Here you go, Kevin.  - Thank you.

32
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,497
Hey, you catch the game? Patriots killing 'em.

33
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,291
Hey, we got security footage from the bus station.

34
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,044
- Want me to take a look at them?  - No, I got it.

35
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,088
All right. Have a good one, buddy.

36
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,631
See ya.

37
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,182
OK, how many in your party, three? OK.

38
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,938
- Excuse me.  - Yes?

39
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,398
Is your owner available?

40
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,109
I'm the owner. How can I help you?

41
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,945
Uh, do you guys have any job openings?

42
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,075
Uh, well, we've been awfully busy lately. I might can work you in.

43
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm not sure. Do you have any experience?

44
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,792
So sorry. Frankie!

45
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,837
Yes, I have experience.

46
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,007
I'll be damned.

47
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,765
Don't hover at the tables.

48
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,643
Make sure their glasses are always filled. Hi, Mary Ann.

49
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,230
And ask 'em if they need something, but don't ask more than once.

50
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
When you hear this ding...

51
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,528
try to beat me up here more times than I beat you.

52
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,363
Perfect size for you.

53
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,451
It's got hardwood floors, some wainscoting.

54
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,661
It's a great location to town.

55
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,000
A little bit of a fixer-upper, but it's got a lot of potential.

56
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,215
What do you think?

57
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,635
I'll take it.

58
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,678
Josh!

59
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,932
Two feet on the dock, I'm not gonna tell you again.

60
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,111
- Hi.  - Hi.

61
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:43,286
- Um, are your mom and dad around?  - Um, no, but I can help you.

62
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,830
You looking for anything?

63
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,251
Well, now that you ask... do you have any paint?

64
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,713
Um, we have this book that's...

65
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,550
with all different kinds of colors that you can get.

66
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,969
- Oh, really? Oh, that would be great.  - What are you painting?

67
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,722
I'm painting my kitchen floor.

68
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,185
- The floor?  - Why is that funny?

69
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,230
Cause you usually don't paint floors.

70
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,315
You usually put a rug on them.

71
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,653
Well, I'm thinking that I want to brighten the place up, so...

72
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,740
- What's a happy color? What could I do?  - Hm... there's yellow.

73
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,827
- Yellow?  - Yeah. The color of the sun.

74
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,665
OK, that is happy. I think you just sold me on that. All right.

75
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,084
I can go get some samples of it. I'm Lexie.

76
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,336
- OK, I'm Katie.  - Hi, Katie.

77
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,587
Thank you.

78
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,342
Lower on three. One, two, three.

79
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,014
I'll just... I'll grab the rest.

80
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,772
- What, you're still here?  - Mm-hm.

81
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,234
Let me, uh... let me check you out.

82
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,948
It's just that usually people are just passing through, you know?

83
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:07,245
It's kind of a pit stop. Ten minutes is usually enough. All right.

84
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,913
- I like it.  - Yeah?

85
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,540
Found it!

86
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,459
- Thank you.  - No, no, that's not for...

87
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,627
You're painting something?

88
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,630
Yeah, she needs to paint her floors in her kitchen.

89
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,340
Ah, OK.

90
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,261
- Yeah, I can take them home?  - Yeah, yeah, take it home.

91
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,306
Pick out your color and we'll... we'll order it up for you.

92
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
- Thank you.  - All right.

93
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,061
- Thanks, Lexie.  - All right, there you go.

94
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:37,608
- Rice. Ah, basmati, the king of rices.  - Yum.

95
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,986
Good catch.

96
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,032
- Light bulb, ding!  - Tuna.

97
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,534
- Tuna.  - Soap.

98
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,996
- Soap.  - And that'll be 18 even.

99
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,539
OK, thank you.

100
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,750
- All right, out of 20.  - Bag.

101
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,919
Two dollars is your change. We have some books down here. They're free.

102
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,379
People just leave them on vacation, so...

103
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,757
Yeah. You can take a book.

104
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,759
All right. Well, thank you, Lexie.

105
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,926
- Thank you.  - Bye!

106
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,720
Grab a book.

107
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,473
- Yeah, they're really good books.  - How do you know?

108
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,558
You didn't read any of them.

109
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,685
Bye.

110
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,064
- You want me to go get Josh?  - Yeah, go grab Josh, will you?

111
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,903
- Josh!  - "The king of rices"?

112
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,474
- Hey, Maddie.  - Hey, Rhett.

113
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,559
- How are we doing?  - Hey, Bass.

114
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,520
Hey, are you OK?

115
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,438
- Yeah, I'm fine.  - Y'all looking for somebody?

116
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,357
Yeah, I sure am.

117
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,819
Got a white Honda Civic parked in a handicapped space outside.

118
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,196
You wouldn't happen to know the owner, would you?

119
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,990
I sure don't. Can't help you there.

120
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,742
You got our lunch?

121
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,329
Katie! You got the chief's order?

122
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,751
- Sorry it took so long.  - Oh, no problem at all.

123
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,346
- Can I help you?  - Oh! Ooh.

124
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,307
Oh! Uh... You scared me.

125
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,480
Uh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be snooping. Um...

126
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,442
I wish I had a good excuse, but it's just idle curiosity.

127
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,863
You're the first neighbor I've had out here in ages.

128
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,365
Yeah, my realtor said I didn't have close neighbors.

129
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,326
Oh, well, I'm not close by city standards.

130
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,204
I'm Jo, by the way.

131
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,542
- Katie.  - Nice to meet you. Um...

132
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,545
Look, I moved out here same reason as you, I think.

133
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,506
To get some peace and quiet, so I get it if you just...

134
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,801
Yeah, I like the fact that I can hear myself think.

135
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,178
Yes, thank you.

136
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,724
I mean, isn't it so nice to be away from all that noise and that chatter?

137
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,561
I mean, it can be a little bit deafening sometimes, so it is...

138
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,773
it is nice to meet somebody as rustically inclined as I am.

139
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,401
- Yeah. OK.  - All right, well, it was nice to meet you.

140
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,279
- Yeah, you too.  - I'm down the road if you need anything.

141
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,033
I'm stronger than I look. So, if you get in any trouble...

142
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,993
- OK.  - OK, I'm sorry again.

143
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,995
- It's OK.  - OK.

144
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,330
- Walk safe.  - Thank you.

145
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,915
All right.

146
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,064
How many stops are on your route from here to Atlanta?

147
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,941
- To Atlanta? Um...  - Yeah.

148
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,318
- Quite a few. I wouldn't know offhand.  - You got a ballpark?

149
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,486
Um...

150
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,114
Come on, buddy. You gonna buy a ticket or what?

151
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,953
Uh, no, I'm not gonna buy a ticket, but I can help you. I can help you out.

152
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,456
Uh... can we open another window for my friend here?

153
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,791
Beautiful. Thank you.

154
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,627
- OK, so...  - The whole Eastern Seaboard.

155
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,588
Yeah. Down to Atlanta. What happens in Atlanta?

156
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,632
Well, where do you want to go?

157
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,469
- Where can you go from Atlanta?  - Anywhere.

158
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,221
Atlanta's our southern hub.

159
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,558
There are routes to every city in America from there.

160
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,984
- Hey, everything OK?  - Shit.

161
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,987
Job just got a little harder, that's all.

162
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,337
- Hey.  - Hey, Lexie.

163
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,048
- Haven't seen those kids in ages.  - How are you?

164
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,758
- They're growing up so fast.  - Good.

165
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,803
- Whatcha doing?  - I'm drawing.

166
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,847
Yeah? Drawing, what are you drawing?

167
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,016
I don't know yet.

168
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,186
Hm. It looks sorta like a... carrot.

169
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,063
- No.  - No?

170
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,275
You need to bring 'em by and let me see 'em all, I miss 'em.

171
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,277
- Maybe this weekend, all right?  - All right.

172
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,362
Is it a dragonfly?

173
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,324
No, it's a flying fish.

174
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,950
- Need a bag?  - No, no, thanks.

175
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,535
OK.

176
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,371
- A flying fish. Now I see it.  - Well, hi, Katie.

177
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,581
Hey.

178
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,461
See ya.

179
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
- Thanks.  - Bye-bye.

180
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,884
I see you're a true artist. You got blue all over your hands.

181
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,636
- That stupid door. Use the other one.  - I'll just go out this one.

182
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,432
- OK. See ya. Come see me.  - OK. I'll see ya.

183
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,517
Hi.

184
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,810
Oh, hey.

185
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,106
So, I picked out a color from these samples and I'm thinking

186
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
I might go with lemon twist.

187
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,028
OK. You're gonna paint the floors yellow?

188
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,405
- Yeah, why not?  - You sure about that?

189
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,367
- Yeah, of course, it's happy.  - No, it's a good idea. OK.

190
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,952
- Um...  - How much?

191
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,205
- Uh, probably a gallon.  - A gallon?

192
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,791
- Yeah, a gallon.  - OK, that should be...

193
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,585
You know, I'll put the order in now. Hopefully, we can get it back by Monday.

194
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,588
- Great. Thanks.  - All right. Lemon twist.

195
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,673
Lemon twist. All right.

196
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,178
I'm gonna need a name and a number

197
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,222
so that I can call you when the order comes in.

198
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,560
My name's Katie and no number. I'll just stop by Monday.

199
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,107
OK. I'm Alex, so you know who to ask for when you come back.

200
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,109
This is Roger, we're usually around here.

201
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,819
Hi.

202
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,278
- All right.  - Is that it?

203
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,780
That's it.

204
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,658
OK, great, bye.

205
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,704
When did we start selling paint?

206
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,122
Today.

207
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,209
Ooh, the drawing looks good.

208
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,919
Thank you. Would you like it?

209
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,797
- Really?  - Yeah, I can just make another.

210
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,550
Aw, you're so sweet. Thank you. I love it.

211
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,761
Give me a hug. All right.

212
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,015
- Thanks. Have a good day.  - You, too.

213
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,522
Katie! Wait up.

214
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,483
- Hey.  - Hi.

215
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,862
Hi. You might not want the company, but I'm headed home.

216
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,822
I thought we might walk together.

217
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,782
- Yeah, sure.  - Yeah? Oh, good.

218
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,993
Good, it'll keep me from peeking into stranger's windows.

219
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,912
It's a habit I'm trying to break.

220
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,332
That and snapping my gum. It's a horrible habit.

221
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,461
I started in middle school and... What you got there?

222
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,590
Oh, the little girl from the general store, she drew it for me.

223
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,010
- I think it's the store owner's daughter.  - Oh.

224
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,721
It's a flying fish, right?

225
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,140
Yeah, that's what she said.

226
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,143
What a beautiful day, huh?

227
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,606
I love how the light comes through the trees.

228
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,819
I always dreamed of going overseas to Europe

229
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,698
and learning different languages, meeting new people.

230
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,868
Eating my way through Italy.

231
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,456
I've never even made it over the Atlantic.

232
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm sure you will. You still have plenty of time.

233
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,713
Yeah.

234
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,675
OK, well. Thanks for the walk.

235
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,804
- Of course. See ya.  - Bye.

236
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,274
Detective Tierney, Boston PD. Do you know this woman?

237
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,610
I'm sorry, detective...

238
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,571
Have you seen this woman?

239
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,740
No. Sorry.

240
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,080
- Hi.  - Hello.

241
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,581
Do you know this woman?

242
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,418
- No, I don't know this woman.  - No?

243
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,213
- She's new to the neighborhood.  - Is she?

244
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,845
To the beach? I don't think so.

245
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,226
I saw you got to spend some time with Alex and his kids.

246
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,271
Yeah.

247
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,067
I guess by now you heard about what happened to his wife?

248
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,028
It was cancer.

249
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,992
A few years ago. And it nearly broke Alex in half.

250
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,787
This storm's gonna blow over here pretty soon

251
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,123
and all the people are gonna be coming in from the beach

252
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,292
and we're gonna get really busy.

253
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,680
Katie!

254
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,640
Your paint's here.

255
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,895
I had this extra can of primer in the back. I thought maybe you might want

256
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,229
to put that down before you put the paint down.

257
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,441
Oh, yeah, right. I didn't even think about that.

258
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,109
Let me grab my keys. I'll give you a lift.

259
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,570
- No, I'll be... I'm fine.  - You're gonna walk

260
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,488
- all the way back with the cans?  - Yeah.

261
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,991
- Are you...?  - Yep. I'm good.

262
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,643
What you been doing in there?

263
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,769
Nothing.

264
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,023
Nothing? Look at your hands and look at your mouth.

265
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,443
- What is that truck?  - I don't know, Aunt.

266
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,655
- It's Mark Twain.  - Well, I know.

267
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,698
The kids love it.

268
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,700
I can't complain. You know, it could be worse.

269
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,662
It could be slayer. I got Slayer in here.

270
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,205
Why don't we listen to that instead?

271
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,374
- No, this is good.  - OK.

272
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,710
The switch hovered in the air. The peril was desperate.

273
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,466
All right.

274
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,813
- You can just leave it there.  - No, I can run it up to...

275
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,356
No, no, no, really, it's fine.

276
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,734
- Thank you. Just...  - OK. I'll just leave it right there.

277
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,903
- See ya.  - Bye.

278
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,238
Yeah.

279
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,992
Oh, wait, wait, I got...

280
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,830
some other stuff you might need just in case.

281
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,167
Some tape, sandpaper, scrapers, things like that.

282
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,963
Just tape around, sand it down before you put the primer... you know what to do.

283
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,423
- All right.  - Thanks.

284
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,674
Yep.

285
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,406
He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him.

286
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,160
And a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit.

287
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,027
I like this color. It's brightening up the place.

288
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,196
Yeah, I like it.

289
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,743
So, you think you're gonna stay in town for a while?

290
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,662
Yeah, we'll see.

291
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,873
- All right, have a good one.  - Thank you, Alex.

292
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,087
Well, what you got there?

293
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,172
Did you leave this outside my house last night?

294
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,840
Maybe.

295
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,926
I can't take it.

296
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:25,013
Well, it was just sitting in my shed.

297
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,891
It's OK, I don't have any use for it.

298
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,229
You know what? I just...

299
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,526
I don't appreciate you coming in the middle of the night to my house.

300
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:42,072
And I know this is a nice gesture, but I just... I can't accept it.

301
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,908
- So, um...  - I don't understand.

302
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,660
- It's not a big deal. It's just a bike.  - I know.

303
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,870
- I see you walking back and forth...  - I didn't ask for it

304
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,873
and I don't want it. So...

305
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,501
Wait, I'm sorry.

306
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,298
You know, normally when somebody does something nice for you,

307
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,091
you just say thank you.

308
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,678
- I like the curtains.  - I mean...

309
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,724
I barely know this guy and he comes to my house in the middle of the night,

310
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,643
- and just leaves something...?  - Oh, Katie... Katie.

311
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,397
Look, I know you found a place as far away from people as you could,

312
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,482
but you're gonna have to learn that

313
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,153
if you're gonna live south of the Mason-Dixon line, people give you stuff.

314
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,239
That means stuff you don't want, stuff you don't even need.

315
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,743
- Trust me, there is no hidden agenda.  - No, because when you put it...

316
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,371
And sometimes we just leave that stuff in the front yard.

317
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,665
I just don't want to owe him anything.

318
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,710
It's a bike, not a kidney.

319
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,715
So, you're saying that I overreacted a little?

320
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:45,093
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit.

321
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,139
- All right, maybe I did overreact.  - Thank you.

322
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,433
A little.

323
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,229
Look, Katie, the great thing is life is full of second chances.

324
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,328
Hey, Alex.

325
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,918
So... you were right.

326
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,795
I was right? About what?

327
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,840
I should have just said thank you.

328
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,550
For the bike.

329
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,970
- I'm sorry, I was really rude and...  - No, no, no, it was my fault.

330
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,933
I should have asked you before I did it. 

331
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,394
Bus is here!

332
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,770
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

333
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,525
- Hi.  - Hi, how are you?

334
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,985
- Where's your bathroom?  - Uh, straight back there.

335
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,153
- Oh, thanks.  - Hi, Katie.

336
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,988
- Hi.  - Can I have some popcorn?

337
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,784
- Popcorn anywhere?  - Popcorn... is right over here.

338
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,186
- No!  - Josh!

339
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,318
Josh!

340
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,951
- I hit my head!  - I know, I know!

341
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,202
Alex, is he OK?

342
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,833
- Get him around to the ladder.  - Lexie.

343
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,379
You OK? It's OK, it's OK.

344
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,841
- It's OK.  - I hit my head!

345
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,260
Here we go.

346
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,847
You OK?

347
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,643
Just stand back.

348
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,396
How you doing? You OK?

349
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,024
You're OK. You're OK. Come on.

350
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,568
Stop. Stop it.

351
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,571
I'm fine.

352
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,710
- Katie!  - Watch your step.

353
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,464
Thank you.

354
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,258
Watch your step.

355
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,887
Of course.

356
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,514
Did you forget something?

357
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,525
You forgot your bike!

358
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,372
Katie!

359
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,124
See? It's not so hard.

360
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,462
Hi, Jo!

361
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,121
Hey, so listen, I've been looking over this Lumpkin case and...

362
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,999
I didn't ask you to do that. Who asked you to do that?

363
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,418
You know what it looks like? It looks like his alibi might actually check out.

364
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,837
OK, right.

365
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,798
Lieutenant signed off on it, the DA's office signed off on it.

366
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,552
The case is closed. I've got open cases to work now.

367
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,929
I mean, the guy has three little kids and, you know,

368
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,639
even if there's a slight chance he's innocent...

369
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,225
Oh, God, don't you have like a wife

370
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,020
or something that you can go home and irritate?

371
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,822
Look... no one's innocent.

372
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,824
No one.

373
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:23,330
I don't care if he killed her himself. He was there. He knows what happened.

374
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:28,084
I'm not his judge, I'm not his jury... I'm not his maker.

375
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,879
The job is to bring him in, the other guys sort him out.

376
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,551
Alex, the crowds are gonna be huge, we gotta go bigger.

377
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,054
Every year the crowds get bigger and every year you call me

378
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,847
freaking out that we need to make the show bigger.

379
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,557
I don't know how much bigger we can make it, man.

380
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,351
I am not freaking out.

381
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,978
City council called and said they're expecting 100,000 people.

382
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,357
Now those are big city numbers, so we need to put on a big city show.

383
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,900
I got this new brochure I want you to see.

384
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,569
No, no, no, I've seen the brochure. All right?

385
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,864
No, you haven't seen the new one. But that's not the point. The point is...

386
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,576
- Daddy, when are we going?  - Hold on. In a minute, sweetheart.

387
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,455
Hey, Mulligan, you boys born stupid or you had to work at it?

388
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,706
Zip it, Luther.

389
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,251
- I'll stop in in the next week.  - Great, fine. When?

390
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,170
- No, no, no...  - Katie!

391
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,673
- Hey.  - Hey, hold on one second.

392
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,843
- What's up?  - Can you go to the beach with us?

393
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,429
- Lexie. She's not...  - I don't know.

394
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,556
- We're going to the beach.  - Yeah, I see that.

395
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,601
- I need her to come right now!

396
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,603
Lexie, she's not coming with us.

397
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,774
- I want her to come!  - Actually, that sounds really nice.

398
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,820
- Really?  - Yeah.

399
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,321
- What do you say?  - Yes!

400
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,532
- OK. All right, OK.  - Alex.

401
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,785
- I gotta go. You're breaking up.  - No, Alex, don't hang up on me.

402
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,161
Wait...

403
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,248
He hung up.

404
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,627
- Look at Roxy.  - Roxy.

405
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,796
I think this one's Roxy. Do you like this one?

406
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,297
- Yeah.  - Yeah?

407
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,466
- Yeah. Yeah.  - Should we do it?

408
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,845
- You're a good shopper.  - Are you cool with this?

409
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,473
- With what?  - Katie coming to the beach with us.

410
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,016
Uh...

411
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,103
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

412
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,230
How about you?

413
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,317
It's a little awkward.

414
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,947
Line it up.

415
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,074
Line it up.

416
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,665
- Oh!  - All right, let's get a photo.

417
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,171
Look up. Josh, look up.

418
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,094
All right, you two. Come on, let's get a photo.

419
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,013
All right.

420
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,518
All right, let's take a photo here.

421
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,854
One, two...

422
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,610
Thank you.

423
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,324
OK, one, two, three.

424
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,664
- Come on, give it back!  - No, you're done.

425
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,850
- Caught one. He caught one!  - Oh, my gosh!

426
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,811
What do you got?

427
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,315
Aah! My battery's dead, hold on one second.

428
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,318
- I lost my battery power.  - Oh, no.

429
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,281
What happened to the fish?

430
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,908
I don't know.

431
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,368
What do you mean, you don't know?

432
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,871
Just one time, could I get a picture of you with your fish?

433
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,207
Why do you always have to take pictures?

434
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,836
I don't know, Josh, because I want to be able to remember this stuff, that's why.

435
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,131
Try to remember without the camera.

436
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,220
What do I do about Josh?

437
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,515
He's testing me.

438
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,810
Do you think it's just a phase?

439
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,938
I hope so.

440
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,109
No, I see the way he pushes your buttons.

441
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,695
Josh was young, but he remembers her, you know?

442
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,823
Lexie remembers the idea of her and...

443
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,285
It's just... there's a difference.

444
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,619
You know?

445
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,710
Have you talked to him?

446
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,131
At this point, I don't really know what to say to him.

447
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,677
Oh!

448
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,680
You did a good job with this.

449
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,814
So, why Southport?

450
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:06,696
Um... because it looks like this. Just a clean, empty canvas.

451
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,990
You're starting over.

452
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,160
You know, sort of.

453
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,829
I kinda was just...

454
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,707
- looking for a change and...  - Hm.

455
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,793
I always wanted to live in small town, so...

456
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,421
Well, you found one.

457
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,674
It is pretty small.

458
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,844
Yeah, a little too sleepy sometimes, if you ask me.

459
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:35,016
- Well, the grass is always greener, so...  - Yeah, but it's nice. You'll like it.

460
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:40,730
Are you staying or... you just passing through, or what's your story?

461
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,360
So many questions.

462
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,862
Just curious.

463
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,739
What about you?

464
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,785
- Are you from here?  - I'm from Wilmington.

465
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,454
We used to come here quite a bit when I was a kid.

466
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,998
Stayed for a few weeks, I loved it.

467
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,668
My Uncle Roger, the guy that I work with at the store...

468
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,920
- Yeah.  - ...worked with him for a few weeks

469
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,047
out of the summer...

470
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,051
then when we got pregnant it just seemed like...

471
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,261
it seemed like the right place to stay.

472
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,724
Mighty Josh is crushing my castle!

473
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,269
No!

474
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,315
One, two, three!

475
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,484
Now let's all do Josh's face.

476
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,610
- Ready?  - You ready?

477
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,905
One, two, three.

478
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,257
Well, here we are.

479
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,594
- Thanks for coming.  - I had a great time.

480
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,430
- It was fun.  - Thank you.

481
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,682
- All right.  - All right.

482
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,892
- Well, have a good night.  - You, too.

483
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,942
Oh, hey, I forgot to ask you, how'd your floors turn out?

484
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,028
You want to see?

485
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,239
All right.

486
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,287
Wow, look at that.

487
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,998
I wasn't too sure about the yellow, but it looks pretty good.

488
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,667
Yeah, thank you.

489
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,546
Thanks to your primer and Lexie's keen eye...

490
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,798
- Yeah.  - I think it worked out.

491
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,300
Looks like your walls need a little...

492
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,510
- Jeez!  - Oh, my God.

493
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,097
Are you OK?

494
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,183
Sorry I'm laughing. Are you OK?

495
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,105
What the hell just happened here?

496
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,443
- I'm sorry, I should've told you about that.  - I just made a giant hole in your floor.

497
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,862
- The hole was there. So you're OK.  - I can fix this.

498
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,030
- I have...  - You're OK, right?

499
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,782
I have a hammer and some nails in my truck.

500
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,992
- You're fine, you're fine.  - It would take me two minutes to...

501
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,495
- Alex, it's...  - You don't want to leave a giant hole...

502
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,456
- OK. Here.  - So...

503
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,420
- So...  - All right.

504
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,839
- I'm fine. I promise.  - I'm gonna go.

505
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,927
Bye, Josh.

506
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,845
- Bye.  - I had fun.

507
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,263
That's it?

508
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,060
- How about some manners?  - He's fine. He's fine.

509
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,686
He's tired.

510
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,649
Thank you, again. I had fun.

511
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,526
Hey, anytime.

512
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,821
I think they had more fun with you than me.

513
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,199
Drive safe.

514
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,202
Bye.

515
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,882
Careful up there.

516
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,719
You know, if you fall, it's not gonna be anybody's fault but your own.

517
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,900
That's enough, honey. You've got enough of those already.

518
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,404
- Come on in.  - Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.

519
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,197
It's me again.

520
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,782
Mind if I come in for a moment?

521
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,909
Actually, this is a very bad time.

522
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:26,330
It's time for my husband's nap. Dan, come on in for your nap.

523
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,207
I understand, I'm so sorry to bother you.

524
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,959
I just needed to ask you a few more questions.

525
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,753
I answered all of your questions about her last time.

526
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,755
I really don't know what you want me to say.

527
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,675
- It's just a moment of your time...  - You wanna bring some cherries home?

528
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,720
- No, dear, he doesn't. No.  - No, sir. Thank you.

529
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,599
Have a good day.

530
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,169
Here's one.

531
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,508
Hey, Katie! Come here and you try.

532
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,720
No, I don't really know what I'm doing, so...

533
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,931
- Come on, you can do it.  - Come on, it's easy.

534
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,643
- It's tradition.  - OK. All right. What do I do?

535
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,146
You just see a fish and you stab it.

536
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,524
- I... I stab a fish. OK, easy.  - Yeah.

537
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,985
- I'm your eyes.  - How do I...?

538
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,528
Here's one right here.

539
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,572
- Get him!  - You see it? OK, you just stab it, OK?

540
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,574
OK, OK, I got it, I got it.

541
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,327
Whoo! Oh, shit, I got it!

542
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,497
What's this?

543
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,834
This is a gift.

544
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,671
- This is to say thank you.  - Wha...?

545
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,840
- Did you actually catch this?  - I speared it.

546
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,634
You gigged it.

547
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,552
- I gigged it? I gigged it.  - You gigged it.

548
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,179
Josh, look at this.

549
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,473
- She gigged it.  - Cool.

550
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,392
- That is disgusting.  - That is...

551
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,685
But you know what? I can't accept it.

552
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,145
You're gonna have to stop doing nice things for me.

553
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,773
Ah... Well...

554
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,442
you could just say thank you.

555
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,862
OK, well, thank you, for thank you flounder.

556
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,324
- I'm gonna put it in the fridge.  - Yeah.

557
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,827
All right.

558
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,787
Did Josh leave already?

559
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,415
Yeah, I'll take you to soccer, sweetheart. Go get your backpack.

560
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,708
- OK.  - Hey, Lexie.

561
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Hi.

562
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,337
- What about my snack?  - Uh...

563
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,590
- I'll get you some oranges, all right?  - OK.

564
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,468
All right, well, you'll have to let me know how the fish is.

565
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,929
Oh, I'm sure it'll be great. We'll probably grill that up tonight.

566
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:50,224
- Yeah? Well, good.  - Mm-hm.

567
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,768
I don't know how to grill flounder, but I'm sure you do.

568
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,562
- Oh, it's pretty simple.  - Yeah?

569
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,440
I like to go fishing in my canoe.

570
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,113
You ever go canoeing?

571
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,159
- Canoeing, you ever been?  - Canoeing?

572
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,203
- Uh... no.  - I like canoeing.

573
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,080
Where do you go?

574
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,291
Dutchman's Creek.

575
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,086
Dutchman's Creek, lot of gators there. I like Walden Creek better.

576
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,047
- Just got a new canoe.  - Hm.

577
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,466
Anyway, there's, uh...

578
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,719
It's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it's beautiful out there.

579
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,763
- You know?  - Yeah.

580
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,557
Hey, I think I got everything I need here.

581
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,852
Spit it out. Get it over with, will you?

582
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,440
- You wanna go canoeing with me?  - No price tag on it. How much is it?

583
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,610
Yes. Yes, I would.

584
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,737
- You would?  - Yes.

585
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:47,364
- Tomorrow?  - That'd be great.

586
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,574
OK.

587
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:52,995
We should be back around six or seven. There's plenty of food in the fridge.

588
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:56,499
As you know, the kids won't be shy about telling you what they don't like.

589
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,043
- Well, it's gonna rain, you know?  - What?

590
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,462
It's not gonna rain. I checked the weather report.

591
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,464
It said a five percent chance of rain.

592
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,758
Yeah, well, the weather report's wrong.

593
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,134
They have instruments for this.

594
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,970
Doppler, Super Doppler, all kinds of other crap.

595
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,556
You have an arthritic knee.

596
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,351
It tightens up, it's gonna rain.

597
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,603
- Don't need a Doppler or Super Doppler...  - It's not gonna rain.

598
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,105
To figure that out.

599
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,197
- It's so beautiful.  - Yeah.

600
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,242
This is probably my favorite place in the whole world.

601
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,210
Did you used to, um... come here with your wife?

602
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,589
Yeah.

603
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,845
Does it get better? With time?

604
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,018
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,898
Yeah, at first, I tried to avoid any place that we went together.

606
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,066
I tried to forget, I tried to put it all behind me.

607
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,696
I tried to, you know... just look forward.

608
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,242
But it just didn't work.

609
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,245
And I realized that if...

610
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,915
if I'm not thinking about her, who is?

611
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,585
You know? And she didn't deserve that.

612
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,420
She was an amazing woman and I loved her

613
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,464
and I want my kids to know that.

614
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,258
I want them to know her.

615
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,765
So... I don't know, I just...

616
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,562
We're just keeping our heads down.

617
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:30,110
Getting to play mom and dad which is interesting.

618
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,864
Just trying to keep it all together, really.

619
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,041
But today with you, this is probably the first time that I've looked up.

620
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,465
It's a perfect day.

621
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,013
Did you feel that?

622
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,558
No.

623
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,061
All right.

624
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,940
It's just a little light shower. It'll pass in a bit.

625
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,068
- Yeah, just a little...  - Let's go over here.

626
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,156
It's off in the distance. We'll be all right.

627
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,618
- Did you hear that?  - We're all right under here.

628
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,163
OK! Uh...

629
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,623
You know what?

630
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,877
I have a better idea. You hungry?

631
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,463
- Yeah. OK.  - OK. All right.

632
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,590
Come on.

633
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,179
Oh, my gosh!

634
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,024
Come on.

635
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,703
Hello. How's it going?

636
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,207
- Want to just sit here?  - Can we seat ourselves?

637
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,175
I have a friend who's coming back from Charlotte.

638
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,968
He should be able to pick us up on his way back through,

639
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,387
but he isn't picking up his phone, so...

640
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,972
Well, no rush.

641
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,059
I mean, I'm happy here.

642
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,478
- So...  - Yeah?

643
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,146
Yeah.

644
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,815
It's a big study. That's what this whole book is about.

645
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:36,570
What I always wondered was gorillas, maybe the strongest animals on the planet.

646
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,197
- Primates, anyway.  - Yeah. Mm-hm.

647
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,782
- Don't eat meat.  - Fruits and vegetables.

648
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,575
They eat mostly kale.

649
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,911
Yes, kale is fantastic for your body.

650
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,579
Is there protein in kale or is that just...?

651
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,581
- I'm sure there is.  - Where does the strength come from?

652
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,417
- They have to... it has to be genetic.  - It's genetic, but...

653
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,419
Except what are you gonna eat? Fruit, vegetables, nuts...

654
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,173
I'm guessing Rhett will be here soon. I should probably settle the...

655
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,635
It sure cleared out.

656
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,429
- Let me see if I can find someone.  - Thank you, by the way.

657
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,098
You're welcome.

658
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,560
Hello?

659
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,940
Hello?

660
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,284
This song is nice.

661
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,993
Let's go this way.

662
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,047
What's this?

663
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,889
- Well, thank you.  - Oh, you're welcome.

664
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,391
- How's my hat?  - Very pretty.

665
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,059
Thank you.

666
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,173
Step away from the girl!

667
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,718
All right, all right. It's just Rhett.

668
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,637
Come on.

669
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,347
Come on.

670
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,974
It's just my friend.

671
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,061
We're in for a nasty rainy season.

672
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,313
I don't know what we're gonna do on the Fourth if it keeps going like this.

673
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,856
What does that mean, the fireworks are a wash?

674
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,567
Not a chance, buddy-boy. The show goes on.

675
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,279
We've been running the fireworks show here for as long as we can remember.

676
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,073
Biggest extravaganza on the Eastern Seaboard.

677
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,741
- What?  - Yeah.

678
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,910
- That's a slight exaggeration.  - Oh, I don't think so.

679
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,370
Maybe the lower third of North Carolina.

680
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,497
- Oh, bullshit.  - God.

681
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:37,626
Bullshit. Who does it better than we do? Come on.

682
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,337
- That's the answer. Thank you.  - Nobody does it better than we do, officer.

683
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,048
- Nobody. We do it best.  - Yep.

684
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,555
End of the line, everybody out.

685
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,723
Pretty isolated out here.

686
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,434
- I got neighbors. They're not too far.  - Hm.

687
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,146
Oh.

688
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,108
Pleasure as always, ma'am.

689
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,657
- All right.  - OK.

690
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,743
- Good night. Thank you.  - Oh...

691
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,246
Come here.

692
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,350
Shut up.

693
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,692
- Thank you.  - You got it, buddy.

694
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,778
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.  - You bet.

695
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,530
- We'll talk fireworks.  - Yes, we will.

696
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,914
I guess your arthritis is smarter than the both of us.

697
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,709
Dad? Where have you been?

698
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,628
Out having fun.

699
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,340
Why are they still up?

700
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,676
Probably too much candy.

701
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,053
Hey, guys.

702
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,722
Where have you been?

703
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,392
I'm sorry I'm late, honey.

704
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,854
I just... I got caught in a rainstorm

705
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:06,483
and I wasn't expecting to be out this late, OK?

706
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,820
But you weren't here to tuck me in.

707
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,947
I know.

708
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,076
But I'm here now. I can tuck you in now.

709
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,246
Yeah. I just missed you a lot.

710
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,665
You did? I missed you, too.

711
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,250
I missed you more.

712
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,127
No way. Not possible.

713
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,005
It is possible.

714
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,673
Good night.

715
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,796
Dad! What are you doing up there?

716
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,715
It's Mom's place!

717
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,805
I'll be right there. Hold on.

718
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,689
You're not supposed to be up there.

719
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,901
I know. I know.

720
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,903
Look, I know that it's Mom's place.

721
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,572
And it's always gonna be her place.

722
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,948
Not like you care.

723
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:05,078
Hey. Hey... Come on, bud, I'm doing the best I can, all right?

724
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,164
- It's Mom's place.  - I know that it's Mom's place.

725
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,319
Thank you for everything.

726
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,655
Oh, kiddo, you're welcome.

727
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,866
Just call me when you land somewhere safe, OK?

728
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,538
Do you promise? You take this.

729
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,498
Be careful.

730
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,047
Hey, it's me.

731
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,717
I know I should have called a long time ago...

732
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,345
but I just wanted to let you know that...

733
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,640
I've ended up somewhere safe.

734
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:01,648
That's your handwriting.

735
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,819
Now you lied to me, Mrs. Feldman.

736
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:09,489
You told me you didn't know her, but that's not the case, is it?

737
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,325
So, open the door, we're gonna have that little talk now.

738
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:15,203
When you get a warrant, I'll open the door.

739
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,250
Well, don't go away, I'll get that warrant.

740
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,340
I'm here for a pick up.

741
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,854
I don't want you to get in trouble.

742
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,606
I just came by to see you because...

743
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,698
I gotta go. All right, quit messing around and get back to work.

744
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,910
- See you tonight!  - Bye!

745
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,248
We spent hours talking at dinner last night.

746
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,333
I haven't had that much fun in a long time.

747
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,712
Hm, to think it all started with a bike.

748
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,672
I thought you said that was him just being Southern.

749
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,967
Ah, yeah, I was lying. He was making a move.

750
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,677
What?

751
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,221
You know, some people just need a little nudge.

752
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,223
I could tell you weren't gonna get there on your own.

753
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,101
- Yeah, well, you're lucky it worked out.  - Yep.

754
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,604
- You want anything?  - Oh, no, I'm good.

755
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:57,013
So, um... I fixed the floor.

756
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,098
- Oh, yeah?  - Yeah.

757
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,516
Hm.

758
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,227
If you wanna check it out.

759
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,898
Yes.

760
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,275
OK.

761
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,110
- OK.  - OK.

762
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,609
- Angel Cake's the fireworks.  - Oh.

763
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,653
No, they're elegant, they don't cost as much.

764
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,114
They come in red, white and blue, you're really gonna love these.

765
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,533
I think we should go with these this year. Take a look.

766
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,369
Highway Patrol just faxed these docs for you to sign, boss, if you don't mind.

767
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,538
All right. That's fine. Anyway... Oh, you know what?

768
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,415
We could go with the, uh... What's the other one?

769
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,709
Black Cat Aerial Phenomenons or the Whistling Dixies.

770
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:53,046
The Whistling Dixies. I mean, they really whistle "Dixie." How cool is that?

771
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,131
No, it really is. Where did I leave that?

772
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,382
- In the can.  - Shit, you're right.

773
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,676
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

774
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,095
Alex, let me get this for you.

775
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,560
- Bass, where did you put it?  - In the can.

776
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:22,075
Rhett, I gotta... I forgot something back at the house.

777
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,911
- What?  - I'll be back in a minute.

778
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:28,956
Hey, hey...

779
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,042
I know, I know, I know.

780
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,211
Kevin, can I see you in my office?

781
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,422
- Yeah, I'm in the middle of something...  - Now!

782
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,722
Oh...

783
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:49,018
- All right, I'll see ya later, Katie.  - All right. I'll see you tomorrow, Frankie.

784
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,105
Erin?

785
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,111
What is this, some kind of a joke?

786
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,781
What is this?

787
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,326
- I don't know.  - You don't know?

788
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,078
"Special bulletin, person of interest,

789
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,206
suspect murder, first degree. Erin Tierney" ?

790
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,462
- Who did you kill?  - No, it's not what you think.

791
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,548
Why don't you tell me what I'm supposed to think then?

792
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:22,468
Because I see your picture on a wanted sign saying you're a suspect for murder.

793
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,306
Your name is Erin.

794
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,687
Erin.

795
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,480
- Please, Alex, let me explain.  - I trusted you.

796
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:38,568
I let you into our lives, for Godsakes, my kids.

797
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,738
My kids trusted you. What the hell am I supposed to tell my kids?

798
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,990
That I was stupid, I was a stupid young girl

799
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,325
that got into a relationship with the wrong man.

800
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,620
- How am I supposed to believe that?  - Who hurt me.

801
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,581
How am I supposed to believe anything that comes out of your mouth?

802
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,833
I don't even know your first name, for Chrissakes.

803
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:58,045
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

804
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,506
The last thing that I wanted to do is hurt anybody.

805
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,508
- You should go.  - Especially you.

806
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,554
You should go. You should probably go before Rhett sees that.

807
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,936
What's up, boss?

808
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,815
You tell me.

809
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,068
What's this?

810
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,196
That's... that's not what you think.

811
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,281
Tell me what it is.

812
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,954
What's in your water bottle?

813
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,626
Your water bottle, you carry it with you everywhere you go. What's in it?

814
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,755
- Water.  - Yeah? Give it to me.

815
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,715
Why?

816
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:54,852
As of now, you are suspended without pay, pending internal review.

817
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,063
I need you to hand over your badge and your gun.

818
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,440
Don't take the badge, boss.

819
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:03,402
Do you have any idea how many rules you've broken?

820
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,321
Hey, Miss Katie!

821
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,074
You know, I knew you were crazy, but I didn't think you were stupid.

822
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:11,536
- I need to find her.  - You don't do it like this.

823
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,665
You know that. You know that!

824
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,292
I need your badge and your gun.

825
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,754
I need to find her, Jim.

826
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,258
Kevin, you sent out a nationwide APB.

827
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,511
She's not a murderer for Chrissakes, she's your goddamn wife.

828
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,681
Something smells amazing.

829
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,683
Hey, you're home early.

830
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,645
Oh, you're killing me.

831
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:48,322
- How was your day?  - Tiring, sweaty, hot, horrible.

832
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,075
Lovely. What's this for?

833
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,912
What's it for? I need an excuse to give my wife a gift?

834
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,789
- It's beautiful. Thank you.  - You like it?

835
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,541
Yeah. It's really gorgeous.

836
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,252
- May I?  - Of course.

837
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,262
This is the best pie I've ever tasted.

838
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,181
Yeah? It's a new recipe.

839
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,642
It's so good. So good.

840
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,770
Thank you. Are you done with this?

841
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,314
Yeah.

842
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:29,947
You think I'm done with that?

843
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,164
No, I was just... coming to pour you some more.

844
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,338
You want to say something, you say it.

845
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,885
I don't have anything to say.

846
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,099
You got that look.

847
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,020
I don't have any look.

848
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,232
What do you want from me?

849
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,653
Nothing. I don't want anything.

850
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,784
How many times do you have to hear me say I'm sorry?

851
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,329
You won't let it rest.

852
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:23,292
Every moment of every day you want me to apologize. You make me...

853
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,337
No, it's fine, I promise. It's fine.

854
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,089
I'm just gonna go put on some coffee.

855
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,925
- You think you can walk away from me?  - No.

856
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,510
Huh?

857
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,554
- Kevin!  - What do you want from me, baby?

858
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,725
I give you everything! Everything!

859
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,187
Stop, please. Kevin, stop, please!

860
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:46,607
- What do you want from me, huh?  - Please. Please, please...

861
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,402
No! 

862
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,823
Stop! Please.

863
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,825
No!

864
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,536
Listen to me. You listen to me.

865
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,913
- You know that I love you.  - Stop!

866
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,875
I gave you the necklace for a reason, baby! Why did you make me do this?

867
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,753
- Stop fighting, stop fighting.  - Kevin!

868
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:12,508
I love you so much, and you want to walk away from me?

869
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,578
- Katie, what's going on?  - I've gotta get out of here.

870
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,790
I've been here for too long.

871
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,334
Whoa, what are you talking about? You just got here.

872
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,836
It's exactly what I was afraid of, Jo.

873
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,881
The things I've done... I can't stay.

874
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:38,302
OK, Katie, let's just calm down, OK? We can figure this out. All right?

875
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:41,180
Wait, does Alex know that you're leaving?

876
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,891
Who do you think was the one who told me to go?

877
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,561
Alex wants nothing to do with me anymore.

878
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,856
And frankly, I don't blame him.

879
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:56,570
Look, Katie, if you run now, you're taking the easy way out.

880
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,658
The easy way? You think this is easy for me?

881
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,201
You obviously don't know me.

882
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,370
Katie, you have people here who care about you.

883
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:11,210
I think that you should stay here and face whatever this is.

884
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,046
Face things the way you face things?

885
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,048
Excuse me?

886
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:20,302
Come on, Jo. You know you're stuck here and for no good reason.

887
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,848
At least I know when it's time for me to leave.

888
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,267
Yeah, you're right, Katie.

889
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,812
But some of us don't have that choice.

890
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,734
Good luck, Katie.

891
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,565
Katie!

892
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,975
Excuse me.

893
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,812
Excuse me. Katie!

894
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,315
Katie! Hey.

895
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,319
- Alex.  - Look...

896
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:03,072
- I can't.  - I'm sorry.

897
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,240
I'm sorry.

898
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,660
I'm so sorry. Please, just...

899
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,244
just stay.

900
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,707
No. You were right.

901
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,377
I have to go.

902
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:21,465
- He's gonna find me. He's gonna find us.  - Whoa, wait. Just tell me the truth.

903
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:24,260
Just tell me what happened, and if you're in trouble,

904
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,720
we can get the police involved. I can talk to Rhett.

905
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,057
You don't understand, Alex, he is the police.

906
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:36,355
My husband's a cop in Boston. That's why he could do all that.

907
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:41,527
I don't care, all right? I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.

908
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,613
I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.

909
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,869
It doesn't even matter.

910
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,832
I can't put you through that. I can't put your family through that.

911
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,710
He's always gonna be there.

912
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:02,214
- He doesn't quit.  - Katie. Listen to me.

913
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,508
I'm in love with you.

914
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,262
I'm in love with you.

915
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,389
And if you stay, I promise...

916
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,351
there's no safer place in the world than right here with me.

917
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,730
God, I'm so scared.

918
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,941
I know you are, but you don't have to be.

919
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,154
You don't have to be scared.

920
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,324
I love you.

921
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,951
Please stay.

922
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,519
Saturday, 2:03 p.m.

923
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,646
Hey, Ma, it's Andy. Give me a call.

924
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,107
Sunday, 9:00 p.m.

925
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,860
Hi, this is Ernie calling from Buffalo...

926
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,529
Monday, 11:47 a.m.

927
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,407
Hey, it's me.

928
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,118
I know I should have called a long time ago...

929
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,538
but I just wanted to let you know that...

930
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,307
I've ended up somewhere safe.

931
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,542
Hello, you've reached Ivan's Fish Shack,

932
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:28,086
Southport's finest waterfront cafe.

933
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,298
We're open Tuesday through Sunday from ten to ten,

934
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:36,053
and we're located at 631 Yacht Basin, just past the Frying Pan.

935
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,098
If you need to leave a message for Maddie, just wait for the beep.

936
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,600
Thank y'all.

937
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:49,107
You just become dark, like there's...

938
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,028
the life is just sucked out of you.

939
01:23:56,406 --> 01:24:01,036
You just felt worthless, like there's no point.

940
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:07,626
And I just stuck up for him all the time.

941
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,921
'Cause it wasn't his fault. It was mine.

942
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,593
And you're completely alone.

943
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,350
It's OK.

944
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,186
It's OK.

945
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,485
You're OK now.

946
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,283
I've never really talked about it.

947
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,620
I'm so glad you're here.

948
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,125
And I am, too.

949
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,335
Everything's gonna be OK.

950
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,171
Yeah.

951
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,188
- Whoa!  - Whoa!

952
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,779
You're gonna help me carry these in?

953
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,033
Thank you, buddy. I appreciate it.

954
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:36,173
Listen...

955
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,010
if there's a problem with her being here,

956
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,803
- I want you...  - No, it's cool.

957
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,890
Seriously. I'm fine.

958
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,062
I like her.

959
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,690
- You like her?  - Yeah.

960
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,402
Well, I like her, too.

961
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,658
I know she likes you.

962
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,284
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

963
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,152
Do you need any help?

964
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,669
Is that all?

965
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:41,590
You're a little small to be running a store. 

966
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:45,469
- My daddy runs it. I'm just helping.  - Yeah?

967
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:49,014
- Where's your daddy?  - Not around.

968
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,641
- Yeah, what's your name?  - Lexie.

969
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,311
Lexie, I'm a policeman. OK?

970
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:56,813
And I've just driven a very long way to be here today

971
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,692
and I would like to speak with someone a little taller.

972
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,569
OK?

973
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,905
Where's your uniform?

974
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,868
- My uniform?  - Yeah.

975
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,788
Hm. 

976
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:18,210
I'm a detective. You know what a detective is, Lexie?

977
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,003
- No.  - No?

978
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:24,716
Well, detectives catch the bad guys. That's what I do.

979
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:28,678
Now, also, I look for missing people.

980
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:32,015
That's what I'm doing here, Lexie. I'm looking for a missing person.

981
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,060
Now...

982
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:38,188
have you seen this woman?

983
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,067
No.

984
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,655
- You sure?  - I'm sure.

985
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,115
You wouldn't lie to a policeman, would you?

986
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,575
No.

987
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:56,164
OK. OK.

988
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,917
- How much is that?  - $1.50.

989
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,585
$1.50.

990
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,550
Two dollars.

991
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,636
- Thank you.  - You keep it.

992
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:11,930
Bye.

993
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:21,940
You ready?

994
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,160
Oh! You're getting big!

995
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:38,123
Do policemen always wear uniforms?

996
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,792
Uh... I'm sure they take them off when they get home from work.

997
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:41,960
- Hey, guys.  - Hey!

998
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,753
- Happy Fourth.  - Look who we have here!

999
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,673
- Hey, Lexie!  - Go get her!

1000
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:53,263
The Southport High School Marching Band!

1001
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,772
The Southport Fire and Rescue!

1002
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:22,584
Here comes the Kitty Hawk! First in flight, that's us, North Carolina!

1003
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:30,342
And sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution...

1004
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:25,707
The fireworks start at 9:00, I should be home shortly after that.

1005
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,959
- All right?  - Can I come with you?

1006
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,253
- You wanna come with?  - Yeah, I wanna come with.

1007
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,131
- OK, yeah. Go grab your shoes.  - OK.

1008
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:34,632
Wow.

1009
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:39,345
Hey, and if Lexie's stomach keeps hurting, chamomile tea usually does the trick.

1010
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,765
- We have some over at the store.  - Got it.

1011
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,850
- All right. You sure you're OK?  - We are good.

1012
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:45,060
- You got it?  - Alex.

1013
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,188
- All right, all right. Come on, kid.  - Be safe, have fun.

1014
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,273
Wanna race?

1015
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,902
Hey, look who showed up.

1016
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:56,780
Hey, Josh, man. We got plenty of room.

1017
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,948
All right, hold on, buddy. Let me get in here first.

1018
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,116
All right.

1019
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:01,951
- All right!  - Put that on.

1020
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,537
You ready for a big night? Want to blow some stuff up and be men?

1021
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,165
All right, we're gonna do this, boys.

1022
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,709
Josh, no drinking, no smoking. You got that?

1023
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,419
Bow clear.

1024
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,297
You're not gonna go climbing around on this thing, are you?

1025
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,348
- Feeling better?  - Mm-hm.

1026
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,022
- All right, here we go!  - Ready?

1027
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:33,733
- All right, we're hot!  - Fire in the hole!

1028
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,997
- Oh, there's your precious Angel Cake.  - What did I tell you, buddy?

1029
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,875
- Angel Cake!  - Your precious Angel Cake!

1030
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:05,974
Katie?

1031
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:07,725
Hey.

1032
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,519
Look, I just want to apologize for what I said earlier.

1033
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:11,396
He's here.

1034
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:15,400
- Who's here?  - You know who.

1035
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,728
You cut your hair.

1036
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:01,779
- Kevin.  - It looks good.

1037
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:03,823
It looks really good.

1038
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,910
Thank you.

1039
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:09,162
I found you.

1040
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:14,375
I found you. I missed you, baby.

1041
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,754
What are you doing here?

1042
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:23,426
I just want to talk, you know? I just...

1043
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:25,053
I want to talk like we used to talk.

1044
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,889
We used to talk about everything, you know?

1045
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:31,517
Or nothing, it didn't matter. We just... we just talked.

1046
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:34,938
- I miss you so much, baby.  - OK, let's talk.

1047
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,316
- Out here.  - OK.

1048
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,459
What do you want to talk about?

1049
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,381
You wanna go home?

1050
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,133
I am home.

1051
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,470
What? Here?

1052
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,264
With him?

1053
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:12,892
Huh?

1054
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,981
I saw you today.

1055
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,192
He doesn't know you like I know you.

1056
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:25,113
- He doesn't love you like I love you.  - No, he doesn't.

1057
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,538
You want me to walk away. Is that it?

1058
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:37,583
Yes. Go.

1059
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,545
No, see, you don't tell me what to do.

1060
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:49,095
You hurt me.

1061
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,514
- I know.  - You kept hurting me.

1062
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,642
- I know.  - You need to go right now.

1063
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,397
Now.

1064
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,236
You're making a mistake.

1065
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:07,071
No, I'm not.

1066
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:38,770
- You scared me to death, Lex.  - But I wanted to see the fireworks.

1067
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,855
I know, but we're gonna watch them up here, OK?

1068
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,607
I don't wanna.

1069
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:45,610
All right. This is safer.

1070
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,445
I need you to stay here for me, OK, Lexie?

1071
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:48,946
OK.

1072
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:50,865
Here.

1073
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:56,120
- Everything's OK. OK?  - OK.

1074
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,331
I'll be right downstairs.

1075
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,139
Come on, Alex, come on.

1076
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:07,024
Oh, my God.

1077
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,962
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1078
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,924
I'm so glad you found me.

1079
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,762
Take me home. Take me home.

1080
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,389
What are you doing?

1081
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,392
I want you to take me home.

1082
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:47,398
Take me home.

1083
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:12,924
No, Lexie! Lexie!

1084
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:22,099
Watch Josh!

1085
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,105
Lexie! Lexie!

1086
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,566
Katie!

1087
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,401
Lexie!

1088
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,414
- Dad!  - Lexie!

1089
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,459
Hold on! Hold on!

1090
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:54,298
Hold on, Lexie!

1091
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:04,141
Baby, I'm here. I'm here.

1092
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,394
Back up for me, back up for me, honey.

1093
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:17,363
I gave you everything!

1094
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,330
All right. Hold on.

1095
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,498
All right, you sit right here,

1096
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:29,292
sit right here.

1097
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,002
Katie!

1098
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,337
No!

1099
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:50,021
Lexie!

1100
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,900
Come on. I need you to jump.

1101
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:57,695
I need you to jump. You can do it! Come on.

1102
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:01,449
Come on, honey. Come on. Come on, baby.

1103
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:07,079
One, two... three, come on!

1104
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:17,715
Please...

1105
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,718
I saw you.

1106
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:24,555
I'm so sorry, baby.

1107
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,519
No. No! No!

1108
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:47,286
Lexie...

1109
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:48,663
Lexie.

1110
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:52,166
- Are you OK?  - Are you OK?

1111
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,667
- I'm so sorry.  - Are you OK?

1112
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:57,922
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?

1113
01:42:58,089 --> 01:42:59,882
She's OK, she's OK.

1114
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:02,134
You're OK.

1115
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,678
OK.

1116
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,974
Come on.

1117
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:34,310
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey, hey...

1118
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:36,937
- It's gone.  - I know it's gone.

1119
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:41,150
I know it's gone, but we're gonna rebuild it just like it was before, all right?

1120
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:45,029
I miss her.

1121
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:49,533
I miss Mom.

1122
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:02,213
I miss her, too, buddy.

1123
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,305
I'm always gonna miss her.

1124
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,812
It's all right. It's OK.

1125
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:33,118
So you're really leaving then, huh?

1126
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:38,582
Yeah. I think that we both know it's... it's time for me to go.

1127
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,462
Well, when you get a chance, call me.

1128
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:46,006
When you're settled, so I know you're OK.

1129
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:50,761
God... will you look at that sunlight.

1130
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,932
It's incandescent today.

1131
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,851
Oh, God, it'd make a great photo.

1132
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,063
- Promise me something, Katie.  - Yeah.

1133
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:03,274
That you'll take a lot of pictures.

1134
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,986
You'll only regret the ones that you didn't take.

1135
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:10,447
Thank you.

1136
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:14,159
For being such a good friend.

1137
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,833
You deserve this, Katie.

1138
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,545
You belong here.

1139
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:06,211
Hi.

1140
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,675
So, there's a letter here. It's for you.

1141
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:14,553
- Oh, yeah? What is it?  - Mm-hm.

1142
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,729
I'll be over with the kids.

1143
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:28,817
How's it going?

1144
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,126
To the woman my husband loves.

1145
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:50,214
If you're reading this then it must be true.

1146
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:56,011
He loves you. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, or else...

1147
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:59,139
he wouldn't have given this to you.

1148
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:11,068
I can only hope that you feel the same way about him as he does about you.

1149
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:14,488
But I wanted to write you a letter

1150
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:18,826
because I wanted you to know one very, very important thing.

1151
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:22,913
I'm so glad he's found you.

1152
01:48:24,456 --> 01:48:27,835
I only wish I could be there...

1153
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:31,463
somehow... to meet you.

1154
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:37,177
Maybe in some ways, I am.

1155
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:46,437
Outside of my husband

1156
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:49,773
and my two beautiful children...

1157
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:54,528
you are the most important person in the world to me.

1158
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:02,494
Because I'm gone and they're yours now.

1159
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:08,250
Hey, basmati rice. The king of rices.

1160
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:14,131
It's OK. It's OK.

1161
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:19,303
You need to... take care of them.

1162
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:23,807
Make them laugh.

1163
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,977
Hold them when they cry.

1164
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:30,731
Stand up for them and...

1165
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,984
teach them wrong from right.

1166
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:42,618
The thought of you... it gives me hope.

1167
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:48,290
Hope that Alex remembers what it feels like

1168
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:51,126
to be young and in love.

1169
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:57,508
Hope that Josh finds somebody to fish with again.

1170
01:49:57,674 --> 01:50:01,595
Hope that Lexie has somebody there

1171
01:50:01,762 --> 01:50:03,847
to help her on her wedding day.

1172
01:50:06,892 --> 01:50:12,231
I hope that one day my family is whole again.

1173
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,569
But most of all, hope that...

1174
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:21,740
somehow, I'm there with all of you.

1175
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,745
Watching over all of you.
