14频道走错路了

77
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,160
所以他们总是最后到现场

78

让法医去检查一下

85

92
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,700
说不定能因此找到
Who knows,maybe we'll get lucky.

93
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,320
劫匪用C4炸药破坏了电梯

抓住高手 感觉才更爽
It'll make it that much sweeter when we take them down.

99
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
是啊
Yeah.

100
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,650
什么事?
What is it you want?

101

别冲动
Cool down.

110
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,990
我们有伏特加 有事好商量?
We...We have vodka and take care of business,huh?

111
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,990
估计你会这么说
That's what I thought you'd say.

112

If you'll have me,

142
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,540
我想和你共度一生
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

143
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,730
狂妄的家伙
Cocky assholes.

144
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,200
录像准备好了
Tapes are ready.

145
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,200
看看
All right,let's see what we got.

146
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,410
大厅共有20部电梯
There's 20 elevators for the lobby.

147
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,370
较低楼层12部,较高楼层8部
Twelve for the lower floors,eight for the uppers.

148
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,210
以22楼为界
You can cross over at 22.

149
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,500
一天之中,有多少人上下电梯?
So,over the course of the day,how many people on and off?

150
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,250
- 1万左右
- Ten thousand,give or take.- Shit.

151
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,210
只看谁在装修楼层下电梯
Well,let's see who got off on the construction floor.

152
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,920
肯定没几个人
It couldn't have been more than a handful of people.

153
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,640
这没办法 录像是根据时间来的,不是根据楼层来的
Well,it doesn't work that way.These tapes are time-coded,not floor-coded.

154
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,010
这么多人上下电梯
All these people getting on and off

155
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,760
我们却不知道停在几楼?
and we have no idea what floor we're watching?

156
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,350
是这样的
Yeah.I mean,that's how it works.

157
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,980
你们的监控录像可真行啊
Come on.This is some system you got here,Chief.

158
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,900
别人的大楼基本都这样
Most of the buildings in the city are set up this way.

159
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,110
- 这么设计,真是白痴 - 这话我不爱听!
- Whoever set it up is an idiot.- Hey,I don't need this!

160
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,230
我可是好心来帮忙
All right,I'm down here trying to help.

161
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,150
他这话不是有意的?
Hey.Look,man,he doesn't mean nothing by it,all right?

162
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,780
- 谢谢你前来?- 你去死吧
- Thanks for coming by,okay?- Screw you.

163
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,530
是你的药不管用 还是缺少女人了?
Meds not working or we just need to get you laid?

164
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
- 你怎么了?- 你看
- What's the problem?- Look at this.

165
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,790
这是摄像头 他们知道电梯里没人
It's a camera.They knew the elevator was empty.

166
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,120
他们对大楼了如指掌
They knew the building.They knew the whole system.

167
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,040
即使看上100个小时
Yeah,must be a hundred hours here.

168
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,750
我们也看不出什么名堂
We don't know what the hell we're looking for.

169
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,880
大开曼岛不是不好,
Not to piss on Grand Cayman,

170
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,390
不过我觉得把钱存在安的列斯群岛的话
but I think I can get you an additional 75 basis points

171
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,390
收益能增加75个百分点?
in the Dutch Antilles.I say why not?

172
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,430
不过市场不断变动,
Yeah,but the way the markets keep jumping around,man,

173
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,390
谁能知道几周之后利率是多少?
another four,six weeks,who knows what the rates'll be?

174
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,390
你看过最新的财经报告了吗?
And have you seen the latest Bloomberg report?

175
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,480
- 那里经济形势不好 - "财经报告"?得了吧?
- Shit is bleak out there.- "Bloomberg reports"?Are you kidding me?

176
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,400
大学生 别想得太多了
Come on,college guys.Let's not over-think it.

177
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
是啊 既然安的列斯群岛给的利率更高
Yeah,come on.Dutch Antilles wanna pay us more money.

178
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,150
- 还考虑什么 - 我喜欢安的列斯群岛,
- That's a no-brainer.- I like the Dutch Antilles,

179
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,700
只要银行别在一夜之间破产了就行
as long as the banks don't pack up and take my money overnight.

180
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,160
还是把10％的钱捐给慈善机构?
Of course.10% to the usual charities?

181
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,870
- 当然 - 我同意
- Absolutely.- Cool by me.

182
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,660
我租了一架飞机 今晚在凡奈斯机场起飞
I chartered a jet.It's taking off Van Nuys Airport tonight.

183
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,620
谁想和我一起走的话,这里有专用通行证
Anybody wants to come,I got your private parking passes right here.

184
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,210
这就妥了
It'll be sweet.

185
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,960
现在感觉人生真好
Man,life's looking pretty good from right here.

186
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,800
我考虑一下
I'll let you know later.

187
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,450
好房子 好视野
Nice house.Cool view.

188
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,950
好酒
Great scotch.

189
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,710
劫持了新闻台的直升机 上面写满了"AJ"
You know,jacking that news chopper had "A.J." written all over it.

190
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,840
你怎么进来的?
How'd you get in my house?

191
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,670
太简单了
Please.

192
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,880
你提前出狱了?
They let you out early or what?

193
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,760
表现良好 提前一年释放
Good behavior.About a year early.

194
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,760
不过你们都把我忘了吧?
But I guess you guys kind of lost track,huh?

195
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,230
我们说过彼此不联系 你来什么事?
No contact.That's what we agreed upon.So,what's up?

196
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,600
我想再喝一杯
I think I'm gonna have another scotch.

197
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,820
这是好酒 一起喝吧?
It's good shit,John.You gonna drink with me,right?

198
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,400
当然
Sure you are.

199
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,990
我之所以来找你,
You see,I came to you,John,

200
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,030
因为你的觉悟比他们高
because you the one with that higher consciousness and shit.

201
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,080
- 接着说 - 你问我有什么事
- All right,I'm listening.- Well,you asked what's up.

202
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,040
我就是想你了
I miss my homies.That's what's up.

203
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,870
此外还有一些旧账
That,and some unfinished business.

204
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,630
04年抢劫案你的那份钱 都给你留着
Your money from '04 is safe and accruing interest.

205
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,880
账号在戈登那里
Gordon's got the bank account numbers.

206
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,010
莉莉呢?她在谁那里?
What about Lilli?Who's got her numbers?

207
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,550
她现在和杰克恋爱
She's with Jake now.

208
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,390
我祝福他们 我有件事要谈谈
Well,good for them.I got a deal we need to discuss.

209
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,730
- 一笔买卖 - 开什么玩笑?
- A job.- You're kidding me,right?

210
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,530
你因为有买卖来找我?
You're coming at me with a job right now?

211
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,320
难道我是来闲聊的吗?
Think I'd come at you on some bullshit?

212
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,110
这是难得的机会,约翰 你了解我这人
Once in a lifetime,John.You know me.

213
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,990
我研究过了
I do my homework.

214
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,450
你想让我说什么?
All right,so what do you want me to say here?

215
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,160
什么都不用说
You ain't got to say shit.

216
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,080
只要记住我是04年抢劫案中 唯一在楼梯上受伤被捕的人
Just remember I was the one left bleeding on that fire escape in '04.

217
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,330
警察对我用尽了办法
And they tried everything they could to flip me.

218
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,710
我也没交代, 因为我遵守我们的协议
I ain't budge,'cause we had a deal.I kept my end.

219
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,720
还留着这道伤疤 我对你有恩
I kept this,too.You owe me,bro.

220
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
对你们都有恩
All of you.

221
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,430
我和戈登当年收你入队的时候
What were you,boosting Camaros back in Riverside

222
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,220
你也就是个小混混吧?
when me and Gordon decided to let you in?

223
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,470
别看不起我
So,don't be so quick to write me off.

224
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,440
那好,我和他们谈谈 明天再联系你
All right,I'll talk to the boys and I'll get back at you tomorrow.

225
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,570
这就好 我喜欢你家
You do that.Love the place.

226
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,410
不过警报器太差
Alarm system sucks,though.

227
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,870
你来了
There she is.

228
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,960
我的兄弟 你好吗?
Hello.How's my baby G doing?

229
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,830
我挺好
I'm good,I'm fine.

230
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,880
- 你气色不错 - 我感觉不错
- You look good.- I feel good.

231
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,460
- 是吗?- 是的
- Yeah?Yeah?- Yeah.

232
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,510
医生说你可能下周就结束戒毒
They tell me maybe you finish the program next week.

233
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,090
这八周很难熬
It's been a tough eight weeks.

234
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,010
放心 这次我肯定能戒掉
Don't worry.I'm gonna do it this time.

235
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,060
我这么想也这么感觉
That's what my mind and my body's telling me.

236
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,930
我支持你 你知道的吧?
I'm with you.I'm with you.You know that,right?

237
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,100
- 我不再需要毒品了
- Yeah?- I'm not gonna need these anymore.

238
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,230
我离开戒毒所的时候,
By the time I leave here,

239
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,310
就彻底没有毒瘾了
I'm gonna be cleaner than the day I was born.

240
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,820
你知道我很感谢你吧?
You know I'm grateful,don't you?

241
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,990
行了 你也就嘴上这么说说
Stop it.You don't need to say that to me,all right?

242
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,620
- 我的信带来了吗?- 当然
- Did you get my letter?- Yeah,sure did.

243
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,160
我一直在念叨
I've been non-stop tripping over this,I tell you.

244
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,870
- 加勒比海?- 看看海水
- Caribbean,huh?- Look at the water.

245
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,460
清澈湛蓝 既温暖又凉爽
Clear and blue.Cool and warm at the same time.

246
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,050
我只想回到那里
I've just got to get back there.

247
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,630
等你离开戒毒所,我亲自带你去
Soon as you're out of here,I'm gonna take you there myself.

248
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,510
- 我保证 - 好
- I promise.- All right.

249
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,350
我爱你
I love you.

250
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,980
关掉
Turn that off.

251
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,530
我回到家
I know,so I walk into my house.

252
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,400
看见他在我家里,喝着酒
He's standing there,he's drinking my whiskey.

253
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,280
我正想开枪的
I was gonna shoot him in the back of his head.

254
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,370
开枪就对了
Should've shot him.

255
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,040
这家伙刚出来一天,就想干一笔
The guy's been out 24 hours,already wants to do a job.

256
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,410
- 真是疯了 - 我看是有胆量
- He's crazy.- Or he's got huge balls.

257
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,540
对抢钱的事 老鬼肯定心里有底
Yeah,Ghost doesn't play when it comes to money.

258
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,750
他一向不含糊
He's too smart for that.

259
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,380
- 这混蛋没那么精明 - 一定的
- The bastard's not that smart.- That's for sure.

260
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,500
也就有点小聪明
He's clever,not smart.

261
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,880
我们总是隔一年才能干一笔
You guys,we always wait at least a year between jobs.

262
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
- 说明比不上他 - 戈登你和他交往多年吧?
- There's a reason for that.- Gordon,you guys go way back,right?

263
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,220
他可靠吗?
Think he's being straight up?

264
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,090
当年他完全可以供出我们,
Ghost could've ratted us out a long time ago,

265
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,430
但他守口如瓶
but he didn't.Kept his word.

266
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,640
等他的那份钱拿到手 那就难说了?
What's to stop him from doing exactly that once we give him his cut from '04?

267
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,930
- 问题就在这里
- See,that's the problem.- Yeah.

268
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,060
- 这是大问题 - 肯定有什么不对
- That's a big problem there.- Something ain't right.

269
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,480
- 我信不过他 - 放心
- I don't trust him.- Relax.

270
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,730
- 他会带来麻烦 - 我觉得他盘算好了
- He's trouble.- I think he's onto something,though.

271
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,860
- 他说这是一笔大买卖 - 我不管他怎么说?
- He says it's big.- Do I look like I care what he says?

272
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,910
你们决定吧,我都会赞成
Well,whatever you decide to do,I'm down with you.

273
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,570
- 我去阁楼
- All right.- I'm going to the loft.

274
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,120
私人派对!
Private party!

275
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,620
- 你去哪儿?- 你管不着!
- Where you going?- None of your damn business!

276
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,540
- 你们好 - 莉莉
- Gentlemen.- It's Lilli.

277
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,000
- 谁要的酒?- 这是送给约翰的
- Baby,who ordered the Dom?- That's for Johnny-boy.

278
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,170
酒吧那个穿绿衣服的女孩送的
It's the girl in the green at the bar.

279
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,800
她很漂亮
She's cute.

280
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,760
- 别让她掏钱 - 不行,她要付出代价
- Don't let her pay for it.- No,no,she's gonna pay,man.

281
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,930
这就对了 你们看我的
This is how it's done.Let me show you.

282
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,930
急什么,大学生 这又不是大学宿舍
Slow down,lvy League.This ain't the frat house,man.

283
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,350
你可真能取笑
Well,that's some funny shit,man.That's some funny shit.

284
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,730
我去去就回
I'll come back up later.

285
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,860
- 老鬼 - 久违了
- Ghost.- It's been a long time,girl.

286
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,530
- 你什么时候出来的?- 怎么想我了?
- When did you get out?- Why?You miss me?

287
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,790
老鬼 别纠缠她
Ghost.You need to back up.

288
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,710
你激动什么 杰克
Easy,Jake.Easy.

289
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,380
我真心希望你们幸福 我和她的事都是以前了
I wish you guys the best.Really.It's the past.

290
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,460
我来谈论的是未来
I'm here to discuss the future.

291
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,050
别介意
If I may.

292
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
我说过明天联系你,老鬼
Told you tomorrow,Ghost.

293
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,550
我不是来扫你们兴的 只为了正事
I'm not here to bust any balls.Just business.

294
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,050
没别的
All right

295
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,020
AJ 又纹身了吗?
A.J.Any new tats?

296
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,730
- 纹了几个 - 我也是
- Yeah,man,couple.- Me,too.

297
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,270
- 戈登 - 老鬼
- G.- Ghost.

298
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,810
一向可好?
How's my man?

299
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,070
我很好,哥们
I'm doing good,mate.

300
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,540
气氛有点紧张啊?
Lot of tension in the room,huh?

301
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,290
你有何事?
What do you want,Ghost?

302
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,250
真是的
Goddamn.

303
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,670
现在就说?
It's like that?

304
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,500
现在就说
It's like that.

305
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,510
那我简单说说
Well,I'll be brief.

306
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,510
简单说就像“偷天换日”中的大买卖
Let's say we go Italian Job on that ass.

307
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,230
我们上楼谈吧?
Why don't we take this upstairs,Ghost?

308
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,730
好的
Fair enough.

309
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,570
和以前的计划一样 2500―3000万美元
Same plan as before,gentlemen.25 to 30 mil.

310
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,530
这就是能到手的钱 不过要抓紧
All the cash we can carry.Got to move fast,though.

311
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,870
"抓紧," 是什么时间?
When you say "fast," how fast?

312
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,740
下周二
Next Tuesday.

313
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,620
什么?
What?

314
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,460
老鬼,你让我们5天之内去抢一辆运钞车?
Ghost,you want us to take down an armored truck in five days?

315
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,790
要先搞到路线图才行,
I mean,it's not even worth talking about unless you got the route,

316
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,050
况且路线还经常变动
and they change the route all the time.

317
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,510
- 我们上次就是因此失手的 - 你有路线图吗?
- That's what screwed us last time.- Yeah,man,you got the route?

318
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,800
有 正是下周二的路线图
I got it.Exact one from next Tuesday.

319
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,640
还有什么问题?
Any more questions?

320
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,140
- 你怎么得到的?- 在监狱里
- How'd you get it?- In the joint.

321
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,180
我和一个俄国人交好
I got in good with this Russian.

322
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,140
保护他不受别的囚犯欺负
Had the pleasure of keeping them guys from Compton off his ass.

323
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,230
作为回报,他让监狱外的同伙
In exchange,he had his comrades on the outside

324
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,610
收买了调度员
put the arm down on the dispatcher.

325
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,280
让调度员做内奸,
So the dispatcher do anything to screw the job up,

326
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,990
他在乌克兰的家人都被害了
they're wiping out his whole family back at the Ukraine.

327
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,410
也包括牧羊犬
Down to the sheepdog.

328
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,030
我们凭什么信任这个俄国人?
Why should we trust the Russians?

329
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,580
他们喜欢自己的牧羊犬
They love their sheepdogs.

330
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,370
不说笑话了,
All bullshit aside,

331
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,840
事成之后除去俄国人的份额 还有2500万美元
I'm in for a quarter mil with the Russians out my cut when the job's done.

332
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,090
这你们不用管,
It's not your concern,

333
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,800
不必相信俄国人 相信自己的贪婪
so don't trust the Russians.Trust greed.

334
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,180
- 我们凭什么相信你?- 真是的,AJ
- Why should we trust you?- Well,shit,A.J.

335
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,140
我刚放出来 肯定不急着回去
I'm fresh out.I ain't in no hurry to go back.

336
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,390
再说了,我干嘛要害自己人呢?
Besides,why would I screw over my guys?

337
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,150
况且我的钱还在你手里呢?
Especially when you're holding all my money,right?

338
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,060
那你有什么计划?
Okay.What about the setup?

339
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,070
光有路线图还不行,还有很多准备工作
I mean,there's knowing the route,and then there's the logistics,you know.

340
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,280
杰克的担心不无道理 5天确实太短了
Five days.Jake's right.That's a real,real short fuse.

341
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,490
这就要靠你了
That's where you come in.

342
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,120
你和杰克合计一下 肯定会有办法的
But I trust that when you and Jake put your heads together,you'll figure it out.

343
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,870
不管干不干,今晚就给我回话
Either way,I need to know tonight.

344
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
不愿干的话,没问题
You ain't got the heart to pull it off,a'ight.

345
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,040
把上次的钱给我,我就走人
We'll settle up on the money you owe me,I'm sayonara.

346
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,340
占用你们的时间了 谢谢你的雪茄
Appreciate your time,gentlemen.Thanks for the cigar.

347
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,640
- 戈登,我们看看路线图 - 好
- Hey,G,let me check out that route.- Yeah.

348
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,480
这不是我们的风格 太仓促了
This is not the way we do things,gentlemen.It's too fast,it's too rushed.

349
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,900
钱虽然多,但是感觉很勉强
It's a lot of money,but this whole thing feels forced.

350
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,440
才5天?5天?
Five days?Five?

351
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,610
是的,只要计划好了就行
Yeah,man,but,you know,we can get the setup right.

352
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,780
风险大,获利就大
Bet big,win big.

353
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
这就是真理
It's the only way to play.

354
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,410
我们就是靠抢劫为生的人
We're takers,gents.That's what we do for a living.

355
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,330
我们吃这碗饭
We take.

356
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,830
这可是一大笔钱,杰克
It's a lot of money,Jake.

357
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,210
- 我们正是为了钱 - 你对此有把握?
- And that's what we're here for.- You sure about this?

358
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,590
如果调查可行的话
If it checks out.

359
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,220
如果可行,我干
If it checks out,I'm in.

360
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,360
- 什么事?- 有件事你可能有兴趣,
- Yeah,what's up?- Thought you'd wanna know,

361
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,230
你抓住的海地人
your Haitian buddy?

362
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,690
他的律师起诉你滥用暴力
His lawyerjust filed on you for excessive force.

363
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,030
他是个大汉,还不老实
All right.The guy was 6'5",he was resisting.

364
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,280
不用暴力怎么办?
What was I supposed to do?

365
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,950
那看来伤害他的感情了
Yeah,well,you must've hurt his feelings.

366
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,080
银行抢劫案的事  用来炸电梯的C4炸药调查的怎么样了?
The bank.Hey,listen,what about the C-4 they used to blow the elevators?

367
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,290
经过化验,是来自内华达州的一家采矿公司,
Well,from the taggants,forensics traced it to a mining company out of Nevada,

368
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,710
大约两月前被盗的
stolen about...About two months ago.

369
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,500
有记号的钞票呢?
All right.And what about the marked bills?

370
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,050
银行给出了清单 麦克斯马上就会传真一份
Bank finally sent over a list.Max is gonna fax out a memo right now.

371
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,010
听我说,
Listen,man,

372
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,180
已经好几周了你和阿曼达有联系吗?
it's been a couple of weeks now.You hear anDhing from Amanda?

373
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,520
谢谢你的关心,但我不需要帮助
Listen,I appreciate it,but I don't need any help.

374
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,940
我们自己能解决 不过也谢谢你
We can work it out on our own.But thanks.

375
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,150
那好 我挂了
All right.I'll talk to you later.

376
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,990
从老鬼的路线图上看
All right,so,for this route Ghost is talking about.

377
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,370
我们唯一的机会在这里
The only place we stand a chance is right there.

378
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,000
- 这是什么地方?- 原本是地铁中转站
- What's there?- It's an old subway car turnaround.

379
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,580
很大,和街道平行
It's large enough,and it runs parallel to the street.

380
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,250
合适得很 可以在希望大街,
It's kind of perfect.I mean,we can get access on Hope Street,

381
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,920
不过我觉得橄榄大街和第四大道路口更好
but I say we hold them up at Olive and Fourth.

382
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,880
嗯
All right.

383
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,340
我们要先去那里调查一下,
And we need to get down there first and get some intel on,

384
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,100
街道情况,车流量大小等等,不过看来问题不大
you know,street patterns,traffic density,that sort of thing,but it looks good.

385
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,520
确定好了爆炸范围和路面厚度,
Once we determine the blast radius and street density,

386
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,480
我就能算出需要多少C4炸药
I can tell you how much C-4 you're gonna need to score.

387
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,810
怎么脱身?
What about the exits?

388
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,940
正在研究
Work in progress,G.

389
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,690
我们先去调查一下,再说
You know,we got to get down there first,check it out.

390
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,570
- 想出几套脱身方案 - 没问题
- Give me some exits.- You got it.

391
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,360
- 干得很好 - 好
- It's good work.- Cool.

392
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,780
- 好了 - 好了
- All right,gang.- Good to go.

393
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,410
和以往一样 不难得手
Easy money,baby.Same as before.

394
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,790
钱都在前面的运钞车
All the cash is in the front truck.

395
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,330
后面那辆是空的 只是护航
Second truck's totally empty.Just an escort.

396
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,210
两辆车各有两人
Two men up front,two men in the back.

397
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,920
压动式12口径手枪 和40口径格洛克手枪
Pump action 12-gauge and.40 caliber Glocks.

398
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
或许是9毫米口径
Maybe 9mm.

399
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,970
他们的通讯设备可能改进了,
They may have upgraded their communication by now,

400
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,720
但是防弹玻璃没变
but the same standard bulletproof windows.

401
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,640
他们自以为万无一失
They ain't gonna know what hit them.

402
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,900
好了 先做上标记
Here we go.Must've taken up the tracks.

403
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
就这样
That's it.

404
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,230
他还做这种买卖
Yeah,he's still working it.

405
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,650
也买了辆新车
Got brand-new wheels to show for it,too.

406
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,270
我们走
All right,let's go.

407
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,900
等我的命令
All right,wait for my go-ahead.

408
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,620
- 早上好,弗朗克 车不错啊!- 你们干什么?
- Good morning,Franco.Nice wheels!- What do you guys want?

409
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,830
- 趴在车上
- Get up against the car.- Turn around.

410
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,790
喂,喂,我是清白的
Hey,hey,hey,hey,I'm clean,man.

411
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,210
别碰我 把你的车开走?
Hands off.All right?Why don't you move your car?

412
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
你知道内华达州被盗的C4炸药吗?
What do you know about some C-4 boosted out of Nevada?

413
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,790
我一点不知道
Nevada?I don't know nothing about that.

414
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,170
出了事,你不可能一点消息不知道
Come on,if it's guns or explosives,you heard something about it.

415
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,720
你若是再被捕,就要判十年
You know,you get busted again,you're facing 10 years minimum.

416
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
- 你知道吧?- 我知道这是公共场合
- You know that,right?- I know this is a public place.

417
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,350
我没干坏事 你们还是把车开走吧?
I ain't done nothing.So,why don't you move your car?

418
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,390
- 别胡闹了 - 哈奇
- Do me a favor.- Hey,Hatch.

419
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,060
- 你看看!- 什么情况?
- Look at this!- What you got?

420
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,560
- 怎么了?- 弗朗克
- What's that?- Come on,Franco.

421
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,560
- 你的车胎扎到钉子了
- It's a damn shame.- Looks like you caught a nail.

422
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,310
- 车胎瘪了 - 还是两下
- Yeah,you got a flat.- Twice.

423
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,570
- 拜托 - 后备箱里有备用轮胎吧?
- Come on.- You got a spare in the trunk,right?

424
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,690
- 来,我帮你换轮胎 - 要检查我的后备箱,
- Come on,I'll help you.Come on.- You wanna check my trunk,

425
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,900
先要有搜查证
why don't you go get yourselves a warrant?

426
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,910
调度处,第九大道和110街道路口有一辆车出了故障
Hey,Dispatch,we got a disabled vehicle on 9th and the 110.

427
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,240
多长时间能到这里?
How long would it take to get here?

428
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,790
我就在附近
Yeah,right around the corner.

429
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,000
哦,就在附近
You got one in the area.

430
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,870
真是巧啊 一会见
That's great.It's my lucky day.I'll see you in a minute.

431
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,040
你们以为我是傻子吗?
You guys must think I'm stupid or something,right?

432
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,500
- 开进来!- 搞什么啊?
- Bring it in!- Man,what the hell is this?

433
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,260
你们至少要用正当手段!
Come on!This has got to be illegal!

434
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,380
- 别给我下套!
- No.- Entrapment or some shit!

435
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,220
我看这车没法开了
This looks like a disabled vehicle to me.

436
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,260
你放心吧
Hey,don't worry about it.

437
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,720
我们会列个详细清单,包括你在后备箱的所有东西
We'll do a full inventory,including everything in the trunk.

438
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,220
我们可不想让你说警察偷了你的东西
Yeah,we wouldn't want you accusing the LAPD of stealing anything.

439
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,890
- 拜托!- 提供点线索,弗朗克
- Hey,come on,all right?Hey!- Give us something,Franco.

440
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,940
- 提供点线索吧 - 这真是胡闹!真是的!
- Give us something.- This here is bullshit!Come on,man!

441
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,770
弗朗克,你怎么办?
Come on,Franco,what do you wanna do?

442
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,900
你们两个人简直就是
You know,you two guys,you're a couple of...

443
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,360
- 把车吊起来!- 你在干什么?
- All right,hook it up!- What are you doing?

444
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,280
- 轻点,这可是新车!- 你在干什么?
- Come on!Be nice,it's a new car!- What are you doing?

445
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,780
好,好,我提供点情况
Okay,okay,okay,all right!I got something for you guys,all right?

446
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,870
- 什么情况?
- Come here.- What do you got?

447
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,240
有这么一些人,想更进一步
There's...They got these guys,they're trying to go upscale.

448
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,450
- 干一笔大的 - 什么?
- They're planning something big.- What?

449
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,000
肯定打算干笔大的
They're definitely planning something real big.

450
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,870
- 干什么?- 这我不知道
- Like what?- I don't know like what.

451
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
但我知道他们会用到C4炸药
But I know they're gonna use a C-4 on the job.

452
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
你好?
What's up?

453
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,550
你好
Sup.

454
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,830
你一个人来的?
You alone?

455
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,910
就像电话里说的那样
Like I said on the phone.

456
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,210
没带家伙
He's clean.

457
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,540
- 没有同伙 - 你就是保罗?
- No one.- You Paulie?

458
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,920
就像牌子上写的那样
Like the sign says.

459
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,090
你想买C4炸药?
So,you're the one who wants some C-4?

460
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,510
就像电话里说的那样
Like I said on the phone.

461
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,390
有人买了一大批 外面都缺货
I know,the street's gone dry.Someone bought up a big pile of it.

462
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,590
所以你就来找我了?
That what brings you to me?

463
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,470
- 聪明人
- Smart man.- Yeah.

464
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,770
让我看看你的一类许可证
So,let me see your category one permit.

465
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,940
许可证?我本以为很简单的
Permit?Thought this was supposed to be simple.

466
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,320
没错 只要你有许可证
It is.You got a permit.

467
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,740
我的一类证件
My category one.

468
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,580
是的,很简单
Yeah,it is simple.

469
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,500
我们收下钱,你什么都得不到
See,we take your money,and you don't get shit.

470
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,490
过来!
Get over here!

471
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,670
好了!好了
Hey,whoa!Hey.Come on.

472
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,550
你要是敢动 就在你的头上添几个洞
Move,I put three holes in your head like a bowling ball,big boy.

473
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,380
简简单单的多好?
Should've kept it simple,huh?

474
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,430
- 我们估计你需要帮忙 - 帮忙?
- Thought you might need some backup.- Backup?

475
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,100
你好像被揍得不轻
Looked like you getting your ass kicked.

476
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,770
我让你们在车里等着
Man,I told you guys to wait in the car.

477
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,270
- 你一个人能摆平啊?- 我确实摆平了
- You had it under control,huh?- Yeah,I did,actually.

478
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,100
- C4炸药呢?- 在库房里
- Where's the C-4?- It's in the shed.

479
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,850
- 老实说在哪儿?- 在库房里!
- Speak English!Where's the C-4?- It's in the shed!

480
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,770
- 在后面库房里!- 在库房里?
- Back in the shed!- In the shed?

481
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,780
- 在库房里吗?- 后面库房里
- It's in the shed?- Back in the shed.

482
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,900
在库房里
It's in the shed.

483
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,160
干得好 让弗朗克交代了
Nice job squeezing Franco.

484
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,950
不说,他就要坐十年牢了
Looking at 10 years,funny how he gave up that address.

485
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
你觉得他们就是FedCal银行的抢劫犯吗?
Think it's the FedCal guys?

486
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,040
会使用C4炸药的人没几个警长
Only so many people know how to use C-4,Chief.

487
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,420
- 邓肯!- 卡沃警官?
- Duncan!- Lieutenant Carver?

488
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,670
- 快走吧,杰克!- 我要和杰克警官谈谈!
- Moving and grooving,Jack!- I wanna speak to Detective Welles!

489
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,210
我现在没时间
I can't do this right now.

490
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,050
我们有搜查令
We're executing a search warrant.

491
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,760
属干警察 公干
Police work.Remember what that is?

492
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,180
要让内务部等着吗
Internal Affairs will have to wait.

493
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,640
你绐我打电话,威尔士 你要联系我!
Hey,you call me,Welles.Get back to me!

494
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,600
别逼我去找你!
You don't want me to have to come find you!

495
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,600
你怎么突然来这里?
The hell is wrong with you,coming down here now?

496
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,150
我让你看一段录像
I wanna show you something.

497
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,250
警察趴在地上!
Police,on the ground now!

498
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,670
上!
Go!

499
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,450
威尔士,我这里没人
Welles,I got nothing.

500
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,830
哈奇,他去了春天大街!
Hatch,he's coming up on Spring!

501
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,460
天!
Shit!

502
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,560
威尔士!
Welles!

503
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,530
- 你没事吧?- 没事
- You all right?- Yeah.

504
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,620
两个死者,伊森舍曼斯基和康斯坦丁舍曼斯基
Our two dead guys,Ethan and Constantine Symanski.

505
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,380
兄弟俩 俄国黑手党嫌疑人,但是和FedCal银行抢劫案无关
Brothers.Suspected Russian mob,but they're no good for the FedCal job.

506
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,040
- 为什么?- 移民局说抢劫案发生的时候
- Why's that?- INS said they were being sworn in

507
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,050
他们正宣誓成为美国公民
as U.S.Citizens at the time of the robbery.

508
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,670
- 原来是两个叛国者?- 是啊
- Couple patriots,huh?- Yeah.

509
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,880
我们到来之前他们烧了很多东西
They burned a bunch of stuff before we got here.

510
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,260
只剩下这个
This is all that was left.

511
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,560
像是洛杉矶地图
Looks like a map of LA.

512
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,270
可能
Yeah.Maybe.

513
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:44,020
看看这些东西 C4炸药自动步枪雷管
Look at this stuff.C-4,automatic weapons,blasting caps.

514
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,740
肯定是准备做大案
They were definitely onto something big.

515
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:59,290
斯台普斯中心,珀欣广场,联合车站
Staples Center,Pershing Square,Union Station.

516
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,920
他们想干什么?
The hell were they up to?

517
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,600
- 可以了 - 杰克连线好了 准备好了吗?
- We're good to go.- Jake's all connected.You ready?

518
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,850
我们准备好了,杰西
All right,Jesse,we're up.

519
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,610
演示一下
Show it to us.

520
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,910
好
Nice.

521
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,870
让杰克别再演示了
All right,tell Jake to stop showing off.

522
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,450
好了,关闭吧
All right,man,turn it off.

523
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,250
- 好样的 - 好样的
- Good job.- Good job.

524
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,830
但关键是还有3天了,到底能不能行?
But the point is,I mean,can we do it in three days?

525
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,750
不但能行,还能很安全
Not only can we do it,but we're gonna play it safe.

526
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,090
我们每小时钻一英寸,
All right,we're gonna drill at about an inch an hour,

527
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,220
16个洞要64小时
16 holes in 64 hours.

528
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,760
分开来干,按照进度
Split the work,keep the schedule.

529
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,890
这样准备时间就只有一天了?
So,that leaves us one last day for prep?

530
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,390
没错 足够我和杰克安装线路了
Exactly.Enough time for Jake and I to wire.It's good.

531
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,520
好,我给拉威打电话 看看今晚能不能到那里
All right,I'm gonna call Rahway and see if we can get down there tonight.

532
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,610
谁啊?
Who's there?

533
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,150
戈登!
G!

534
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,120
内奥米 你怎么来了?你不是在
Naomi.What are you doing here?You're supposed to be at the...

535
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,990
是啊,是啊
I know,I know,I...

536
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,620
- 我先走了 - 好
- Catch up with you later,man.- All right,man.

537
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,290
这里真好
Wow,look at this place.

538
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,580
这是怎么回事?内奥米?
What is this?Naomi?

539
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,330
我彻底戒毒了 感觉很好
Look,I am really clean now.I feel great.

540
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
内奥米,你说什么呢?
Naomi,what are you talking about?

541
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,840
再多呆一周也没什么用
Look,another week in that place wouldn't have made any difference.

542
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,090
- 我们不是说好了吗?- 行了
- We spoke about this,didn't we?- Come on.

543
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,430
我做的很好
I was doing really well.

544
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,090
问他们能不能提前走,他们同意了
I asked if I could leave early,and they said yes.

545
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,640
不信你打电话问问
If you don't believe me,call them.

546
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,350
他们说离开戒毒,所以后要有个生活目标
Look,they told us that when you get out,you got to have a plan.

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,020
没有生活目标是不行的
Yeah?Without a plan,you're dead.

548
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,980
于是我想到了你,我的目标,我们回老家
So I started thinking about you and me,our plan,and going home.

549
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,070
会实现的
And that's gonna happen.

550
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,240
但你还需要一周,只要一周
You had one more week,that's all,one more week.

551
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,610
我这几天很忙
It's a busy time for me,Naomi.

552
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,790
- 你不记得了吧?- 我不记得了
- You don't remember it,do you?- No,I don't.

553
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,540
看你当时多么可爱 妈妈真美
Look at how cute you were.Mum was so beautiful.

554
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,840
当时我很幸福
I was truly happy back then.

555
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,630
只有回老家我才算真正康复了,才能真正重新开始
I'm not gonna be right until I get back there,so I can start again.

556
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,550
能做到的 只需要3天
And we can.In just three days.

557
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,140
我在工作 我要送你去旅馆
I'm working.I need to put you in a hotel.

558
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,470
我住这里不行吗?
What?Why can't I stay here?

559
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,930
行 只是现在不合适
You can.It's just a bad time for me.

560
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,480
好吗?
All right?

561
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,610
好吧
Yeah.

562
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,490
我能看出不是街道地图
Well,I can tell you it's not a street map.

563
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,610
应该是某种市政工程图
It's some kind of a public works project.

564
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,780
没有参考数字的话 我也无法确定
But without a reference number,there's no way I can work it out.

565
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,450
好 谢谢
All right.Thanks.

566
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,830
不客气
You got it.

567
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,450
里弗斯,德朗特
Rivers,Delonte.

568
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,130
靠上去
Put your body in it.

569
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,970
接住,小艾迪 上篮
Right here,Eddie.Up with it.

570
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,640
漂亮!这样才对
Yes!That's what I'm talking about.

571
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,930
小艾迪 让着你叔叔,杰克
Hey,Eddie.Take it easy on Uncle Jack,all right?

572
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:51,230
暂停 我昨晚调查了一下 想和你谈谈
Time out.I did some work last night.Wanted to talk to you.

573
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,270
你要呕吐的话吐到草地上
Hey,if you're gonna puke,do it on the grass.

574
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,440
爸爸,让我们打完吧
Come on,Dad,let us finish.

575
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,990
你来替换我吧?
Yeah,why don't you take my place?

576
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,650
不用了 你接着打球吧,小艾迪
I'm good.Go ahead,keep playing,Eddie.

577
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,660
- 小艾迪的情况好多了 - 好得很
- Eddie looks like he's doing a lot better.- Yeah,he's doing great,man.

578
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,000
他上次透析有一个月了
I mean,it's been about a month since his last dialysis.

579
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,540
几天内还不行,然后渐渐康复
Down for a couple days,then he bounces back.I mean...

580
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,960
- 你发现了什么情况?
- So,anyway,what's up?- All right.

581
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,010
你记得几年前韩国居民区的 珠宝抢劫案吗?
You remember the jewelry job in Koreatown,few years back?

582
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,930
劫匪利用电线从一栋楼 逃到另一栋楼?
They used wires and went from one building to the other?

583
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,010
一个警卫抓住了其中一个劫匪
Guard got loose.He ended up shooting one of them?

584
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
记得那个警卫后来成了大英雄
Yeah.The guard ended up being like a big hero.

585
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,930
那个在楼梯中弹的劫匪?
The perp got shot on a fire escape,right?

586
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,440
叫德朗特里弗斯,绰号老鬼
Name's Delonte Rivers,a.k.a.Ghost.

587
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,690
刚在Chino监狱服刑5年
He just finished serving five at Chino.

588
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,980
他在监狱中的证件 不知怎么到了俄国人手里
And somehow,his prison ID ended up at the Russians.

589
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,320
我在照片上看到的
I saw it in the Polaroids.

590
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,110
你是说这个人参与了银行抢劫案?
So,you think this guy's good for the FedCal heist?

591
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,620
不知道 他在银行抢劫案的当天被释放
I don't know.He was released the same day the bank was hit.

592
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,910
肯定不只是巧合
There's got to be some type of connection there,right?

593
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,370
麦克斯 什么事?
Yeah,Max.What's up?

594
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,330
- 早上好,杰克 - 你好,莫妮卡
- Morning,Jack.- Hey,Monica.

595
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,710
慢点说
Whoa,whoa,slow down.

596
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,550
- 营销代表 - 开什么玩笑
- Marketing rep.- You got to be kidding me.

597
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,470
麦克斯,你让卡沃周一给我打电话
Look,Max,you can just tell Carver he can call me Monday.

598
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,010
我周末不上班
I don't work weekends,okay?

599
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,140
内务部找我
Internal Affairs.

600
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,640
我为你做早饭吧?
Well,can I make you some breakfast,Jack?

601
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,810
不了 我要去接桑迪 我们要去参观几处名胜
No,that's all right.I got to pick Sunday up.We're gonna go look at some landmarks.

602
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,650
- 周一再见 - 再见,杰克
- I'll see you Monday.- See you,Jack.

603
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,030
今天的作业是去哪里?
So,what do we got?What's the assignment for today?

604
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,570
先去星光大道,然后写一篇参观感受
After we go to the Walk of Fame,I'm supposed to write about us going there.

605
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,040
孩子,星光大道算不上名胜,名不符实
Honey,the Walk of Fame's not a landmark,it's a tourist trap.

606
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,500
我知道个更好的名胜 我们去拉布里沥青坑,
I got a better landmark.Let's go over to La Brea Tar Pits,

607
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,460
然后再去博物馆,
and then afterwards we can go to the museum,

608
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,630
去看看化石
we can look at the fossils.

609
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,840
然后再去“农贸市场”吃汉堡
And then after that,we can go to the Farmer's Market and get some burgers.

610
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,380
好主意 我们去“农贸市场”吃汉堡 喝奶昔
Good idea.Burgers and shakes at the Farmer's Market.

611
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,970
你有什么情况?
Yeah,what do you got for me?

612
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,760
孩子,我们要先停下车
Sweetheart,we're gonna have to make a stop somewhere first.

613
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,560
我昨晚接到你的电话以后,调查了里弗斯的档案,
When I got your message from last night,I pulled Rivers' file,

614
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,900
他今天下午有个假释会面
saw he was due this afternoon.

615
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,110
他这样的罪犯 提前释放还要安排几次会面
Cons like him,they're good for a visit or two.

616
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,740
不过四年的一级监禁,我看会面也没用
But four years of lockdown,I wouldn't bet on him.

617
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,570
就是他 要不要我拦住他问问?
There's your boy now.Want me to hold him?Rattle his cage?

618
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,580
不,还是按常规来吧
No.No,keep it routine.

619
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,620
- 你知道他的住址吗?- 住在长滩的某个破地方
- You got an address on this guy?- Some dump in Long Beach.

620
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,670
应该住一周左右
Probably good for a week,if that.

621
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,290
好,谢谢
All right,thanks.

622
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,590
去小东京
Little Tokyo.Let's go.

623
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,340
现在能去博物馆了吗?
Now are we going to the museum?

624
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,140
一会就去
Just a sec,honey.We will.

625
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,980
- 还要别的吗?- 这个要两包
- Anything else?- Give me a couple of these,too.

626
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,730
右边
Here,on the right.

627
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,360
- 谢谢 - 不客气
- Thanks,man.- You got it.

628
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,680
- 你好?- 你来晚了
- What's up?- You're late.

629
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,390
- 会面进行的怎么样?- 挺好
- How'd the parole meeting go?- We good.

630
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,350
屁大的事还要弄的这么麻烦
You know they try and turn pissing in a cup into a seven-game series.

631
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
不过没事了
We straight,though.

632
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,020
- 你要买什么?- 带酱热狗
- Can I help you?- Relish.

633
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,610
- 杰西 - 你好?
- Jesse.- What's up?

634
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,110
怎么了?其他人呢?
What's happening?Where the guys?

635
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,070
我出来买吃的 他们都等着我
I'm take-out.They're waiting on me.

636
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,280
好的
Sounds good.

637
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,990
- 拿到了吗?- 我办事你还不放心
- So,did you get it?- Come on,man.It's me.

638
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,540
爸爸你看什么呢?
What are you looking at,Daddy?

639
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,120
一会就好
Just a second,honey.

640
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,420
和救援队用的一样
Same thing the rescue workers use.

641
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,210
操作很简单
Easy as shit.Works just like a can opener.

642
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,260
- 和调度员谈过了吗?- 谈过了
- Speak to the dispatcher?- Yeah.

643
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,430
谈过了,今天早上和他联系的 放心吧
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I spoke to him this morning.We good.

644
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,970
- 说实话 - 路线是确定的
- Come on,man.- Hey,the route's a lock,G.

645
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
再见
Talk to you later.

646
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,940
你还是担心别人吧,戈登
Hey,man,find you something else to worry about,G.

647
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,650
别担心我
I got you,homes.

648
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,820
什么?
What?

649
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,330
坐稳了,孩子
Hold on to your seat,honey.

650
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,960
会不会开车啊?
What are you doing,idiot?

651
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,110
你找找有笔吗?没有?
You see a pen,baby?No?

652
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,830
看见那辆蓝色轿车了吗?隔着两辆车?
There,you see that blue sedan back there?Two cars back?

653
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,790
- 看见了 - 他在跟踪我们
- Yeah.- He's sharking us.

654
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,170
右拐
Make a right.

655
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,590
你有笔吗?
You have a pen,baby?Anything?

656
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,940
再右拐
All right,make another right.

657
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,120
- 他跟定我们了 - 对
- He's staying with us.- Yeah.

658
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,410
我们停车
Let's pull over.

659
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,960
- 他们是什么人?- 不算什么人
- Who are they?- They're just some guys.

660
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,690
- 是警察吗?- 不可能带着孩子
- Is it a cop?- With a kid?

661
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,690
你急着叫我来有什么要紧事?
What's so important that you'd drag my ass all the way down here?

662
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,740
- 我找到他了 - 谁?
- I found him,Hatch.- Who?

663
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,450
银行抢劫案的劫匪戈登科泽 看看这家伙
Him,FedCal.Gordon Cozier.I mean,look at that.

664
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,290
身高,体型,样样符合
Same height,same build,same everything.

665
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,790
先等等 你说什么?
Wait,hold on.What are you talking about?

666
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,960
- 你怎么得出这一结论?- 里弗斯去参加假释会面,
- Where's all this coming from?- I followed that guy,Rivers,

667
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,250
然后我跟踪了他
from his parole meeting.

668
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,500
- 他在商业区下了出租车 - 带着孩子跟踪?
- And he gets out of a cab downtown.- With Sunday?

669
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,460
你在竞选“年度最佳父亲”吗?
What,are you gunning for Father of the Year now?

670
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,210
我在车上,看见他去了一个热狗摊
And from my car,I see him go to this hot-dog stand.

671
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,010
科泽也在 里弗斯背对着我
And Cozier's there.Now,he's got his back to me.

672
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,510
但我肯定他给了科泽什么东西
But I swear I see Rivers pass something to him.

673
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,100
过了一会一个骑摩托车的
A second later,this guy on a motorcycle,he looks at Cozier.

674
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,140
在离开以前看了科泽一眼,
And then right before he takes off,bam,

675
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,770
和银行劫匪是同一个手势
the same gesture the asshole used in the bank.

676
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,020
然后我跟踪科泽 抄下了他的车牌号
And then I followed Cozier and got his license plate number.

677
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,070
看你画的 用蜡笔写的?
Yeah,it's very official.What is that,crayon?

678
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,650
我肯定就是他
Look,man,I'm telling you,it's him.

679
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,280
可你看不见他的脸 就没有证据
Except you can't see his face.The guy's got a clean sheet.

680
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,820
他只是个有前科的人
Come on,man,you follow an ex-con

681
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,830
也没参加银行抢劫,你还跟踪他到热狗摊?
who's no good for the bank job to,what,a hot-dog stand?

682
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,000
- 然后他和某人见面
- Then he meets somebody...- Listen to me.

683
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,370
也许见了面,也许没见面
Maybe he meets somebody there,maybe he doesn't.

684
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,040
- 也许他递给他什么东西 - 听着,我告诉你我当时在那儿
- Maybe he passes something...- Look,Hatch,I'm telling you I was there.

685
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,170
买了一个带酱热狗,
...and buys a hot-dog with ketchup and relish,

686
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,090
- 然后一个骑托车的
- and then,some guy on a motorcycle says...- Call me crazy.

687
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,340
"告别," 然后走人了
"So long," and rides off.

688
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,800
就凭这些你能证明什么呢?
Come on,man,give a brother a break.Are you kidding me?

689
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,550
我们还能去“农贸市场”吗?
Can we still go to the Farmer's Market,Daddy?

690
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,930
孩子,对不起 天
Baby,I'm sorry.Geez.

691
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,930
没想到这么晚了 我们可以去别的地方吃饭
I can't believe it's this late.We can go eat somewhere else.

692
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,520
只要再过一会 你想去哪儿都可以
Just gonna take a few minutes here.Wherever you want.

693
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,770
真是的
Shit.

694
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,200
你知道你爸爸很爱你吧?
Your daddy loves you very much,you know that,right?

695
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,700
- 别忘了这一点?- 好的
- Don't ever forget that,okay?- Okay.

696
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,250
你要有可靠的证据,杰克
Take care of the real stuff,Jack.

697
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,960
我们吃比萨,如何?
Hey,how about some pizza,huh?

698
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,670
我只想回家
I just wanna go home.

699
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,680
走吧
Let's go.

700
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,180
什么时候的事?
Well,when'd it happen?

701
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,310
没事 没事 如果她想回来你帮个忙,
No,no,no.It's all right.If she comes back,do me a favor,

702
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,560
尽量把她留住,吉姆,再给我打电话
you just keep her there,all right,Jimmy,and you call me.

703
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,570
不能让她离开旅馆 知道吗?
She doesn't leave the hotel.Do you understand me?

704
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,320
好
All right.

705
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,200
内奥米?
Naomi?

706
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,660
我在旅馆给吉米留了些钱 他没放进保险柜
I left Jimmy some money at the hotel.He didn't put it in the safe.

707
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,790
- 她把钱拿走了?- 她拿着钱走了 真是的!
- She took it?- She's gone and so is the money.Shit!

708
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,000
- 你干什么?- 我要停车
- What you doing,mate?- I'm pulling over.

709
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,630
- 为什么?- 因为你想去找她
- Why?- 'Cause you got to find her.

710
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,550
今晚隧道的活我替你
I'll take your time in the tunnel tonight.

711
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,230
- 谢谢了 - 客气什么
- Thanks.- You got it.

712
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,610
真是的
Damn it.

713
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,240
- 上面舒服吗?- 得了吧
- How's it hanging?- Funny guy.

714
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,750
好,下来吧
All right,come on down.

715
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,330
我们明早大干一场
We'll go hot tomorrow morning.

716
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,540
会惊天动地的
This is gonna be lovely.

717
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,930
嗨,戈登
Hey,G.

718
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,180
准备好了?
We good?

719
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,680
一切都好
All signs point to it.

720
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,430
- 有内奥米的消息吗?- 没有
- Any word from Naomi?- No.

721
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,850
我觉得她这次真的走了
This time,I think she's gone.

722
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,650
她不会有事的
She'll turn up fine.

723
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,820
你为何这么肯定?
What makes you so sure?

724
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,150
你是她唯一的亲人,不会抛下你的
If I had any family left,that's where I'd be.

725
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,790
如果明天有什么差错 我们不能让他跑了
You know,if anything goes wrong tomorrow,we can't let him walk away.

726
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,330
他还能把04年的事供出去
He could still hang us for '04.

727
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,500
我可以动手
I'll bring the insurance.

728
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,210
你来了 你好吗,老鬼?
There he is.How's it going,Ghost?

729
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,880
好得很
I can't call it,gentlemen.

730
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,550
- 你们好吗?
- Yeah.- What's happening?

731
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,180
- 戈登 - 好啊
- G.Cool.- Yeah,man.

732
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,640
又能干一笔了 感觉真好就像回到了从前啊
Feels good to be back in action again.It's like old times,huh?

733
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,980
事成之后我们在哪儿会面?
So,where we meeting at after the drop?

734
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,860
斯考特正在确定 我明天会告诉你
Scott's giving me the information.I'll let you know tomorrow.

735
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,780
“来尝尝毁灭的滋味”
"Come sip from the cup of destruction."

736
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,660
- 成吉思汗的话 - 对 我崇拜的人之一
- Genghis Khan.- Yeah.One of my heroes.

737
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,290
想得到什么,他就会去夺取
Saw what he wanted,reached out and took it.

738
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,250
我们明天要做的事也一样
Like us,tomorrow.

739
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,790
我们也一样
Just like us.

740
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,630
- 为了明天 - 为了明天
- To tomorrow.- To tomorrow.

741
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,090
为了明天
To tomorrow.

742
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,520
喂?
Yeah?

743
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,400
慢点说 什么?你在哪儿?
Slow down,slow down.What?Where are you?

744
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,450
好的 我这就去
All right.Wait,no,no,I'm coming.I'm coming.

745
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,310
办公室在哪儿?
Where do I find Processing?

746
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,430
进去那个门 沿着黄线就到
Through the far door.Follow the yellow line.

747
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,570
副警长办公室在哪儿?
Where's Vice?

748
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,280
下楼去地下室
Take the stairs to the basement.

749
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,030
我们上周收到银行钞票清单的传真,
We got your fax last week about the bank bills,

750
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,530
查到这混蛋手上有不少百元大钞,
so when we nailed this scum with a bunch of fresh hundreds,

751
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,950
就给你们打了电话
thought we'd call you.

752
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,700
这个混蛋?不会吧
This low-life?You gotta be kidding me.

753
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,330
他和女友卖毒品的时候被我们抓住了
He was hustling some stolen shit with his girlfriend when we stopped him.

754
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,420
钞票都没做记号,但我们估计是抢的钱
None of the bills were marked,but we figure they gotta be from some job.

755
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,710
你审问他了吗?
Did you question him?

756
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,800
没有 他情绪不稳
No.He didn't go easy.

757
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,710
也抽了很多毒品 我们想等他先平静一下
He's high as hell,too.We decided to let him chill.

758
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,180
好 我和他谈谈
All right.Let me talk to this guy.

759
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,890
我没功夫看你演戏 你的钞票哪儿来的?
All right,I don't have time for this bullshit.Where did you get the bills?

760
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:46,150
不用帮忙!
I got him!

761
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,690
再问你一遍 你的钞票哪儿来的?
I'm not gonna ask you again.Where did you get the bills?

762
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,190
- 是贷款的钱!- 胡说!
- It was a loan,man,it was a loan!- A loan.Bullshit!

763
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,410
说是谁 谁给的
I want a name.Give me a name.

764
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,490
- 内奥米 - 内奥米什么?
- Naomi.- Naomi what?

765
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,620
- 内奥米什么啊?她姓什么?- 不知道!我刚认识她
- Naomi what?She got a last name?- I don't know,man!I just met her.

766
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,750
也调查过她了吗?
You bust her,too?

767
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,630
对,她叫内奥米科泽
Yeah,her name's Naomi Cozier.

768
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,510
科泽?你听见了吗,哈奇?
Cozier?Did you hear that,Hatch?

769
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,590
听见了
Yeah.

770
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,430
我可不愿回旅馆 一个人干坐着
I ain't going back to no hotel to sit on my own.

771
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,060
你不去旅馆,
Right,you ain't going back to the hotel,

772
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,140
也不去什么加勒比海
you ain't going to the freaking Caribbean either.

773
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,390
你要回戒毒所继续戒毒
You're going back to the rehab to start your program again.

774
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,310
- 我不去!- 非去不可!
- Hell,no,I ain't!- Yes,you are!

775
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,110
我受够了医生和护士当着我的面
I'm tired of them nurses and doctors making you stand up

776
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,610
和陌生人谈论我的情况
and chat your business in front of strangers.

777
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,740
你每次都这样,每次都是出来两天又去吸毒了!
Every time,you do the same thing!Every time!Two days out of rehab!

778
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,280
刚出来两天又进警察局了
Just two days and you're in the police station already.

779
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,240
我给你的钱呢?都买毒品了吧?
Where's the money I gave you?Is it in your veins?

780
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,120
你少管我的事
You know,your problem is you're too into my shit.

781
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,410
因为你不在乎自己!
Let me see your arm.Your shit.You're not into your own shit!

782
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,460
你管你自己的事吧?你根本不在乎我
Why don't you get a life?You don't care about me.

783
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,080
都不让我住在你那里
You wouldn't even let me stay at your apartment.

784
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,800
- 嫌我丢你的人 还是我把你养活大的!
- That's right.- You're ashamed of me.And I raised you!

785
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,300
整天吸毒的人还养活我?
You raised me?My crackhead sister raised me?

786
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,630
- 你连自己都养活不了 - 忘恩负义的混蛋!
- Can't even raise yourself.- You ungrateful bastard!

787
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,550
- 别说了 - 你算什么
- Shut up.- But you ain't worth shit,man.

788
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,550
- 当初把你送人就好了!- 你说得对
- I should've let Welfare take you!- You're right,you're right.

789
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,810
我真糊涂
Wonder.

790
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,600

- Second time in two days.- Yeah,I hear you.

794
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,750
即使这钱证明是抢的,也不能证明是科泽干的
Even if we tie those bills to a certain job,it doesn't prove Cozier did anything.

795
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,460

这不是请求你,杰克
It's not a request,Detective Welles.

810
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,510
这是命令
Orders,Jack.

811
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,510

817
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,770
5分钟后如果你还想找律师 可以给你
Look,if you still want to see a lawyer in five minutes,you can have one.

818

我想让你知道你的搭档是什么人
I wanted you to know who you were working with.

827
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,490

现在下了坡道

怎么停下了?
What's the holdup?

898
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,330
我正拦住交通 给个话啊
Come on,guys,I'm holding traffic.Just give me the word.

899
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,590
目标区域还有汽车

01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,180
不会的 如果我死了,怎么给你一半的钱呢?
You do not wanna kill me.If I'm dead,how am I gonna get you half the money?

1060
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,890
你还想要钱吧?
You do want the money,don't you?

1061
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,640
现在消气了吧?我就知道

We're all real sorry,Jack.I just spoke with his wife.

监控录像的事怎么办?考虑一下他的家人?
What about the surveillance tape?His family?

1066

Forget the tape.He was killed in the line of duty.

1067
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,310

He'll get a cop's burial and full benefits.

1068

在地铁站,有两个警察

然后他们就追我

地铁那么多人 为什么就追你呢?

1101
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,760

- I had to.He had me...- Why'd you shoot him?

1106
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,730
因为你是笨蛋
'Cause you stupid.

1107
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,980
没办法!他把我堵住
I had no choice!He had me.He had me cold,man.

好像他希望我开枪
Like he wanted me to shoot him.

1111

1113
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,490
- 放开他!
- G!G!Wait!- Let him go!Let him go!

1114
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,580
你别拉我!走开!
Get off me!Yo,cool it.Get your hands off me!

1115
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,210
- 你知道你做了什么吗?
- Back off!Back off!- You understand what you just did?

1116
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,790
- 这不怪我!- 决不能对警察开枪!
- It wasn't my fault!- You don't shoot cops!

1117
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:30,920
我自会处理!放开他!
I'll deal with it!Let him go!

1118
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,080
那你去处理吧,杰克!
You deal with it then,Jake!

1119
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,840
这可是死刑的罪名,年轻人,我不会陪你的
That's a death sentence,young blood,and I ain't going with you.

1120
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,260
你真行,杰西
Nice one,Jesse.

1121
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,400
今晚还能起飞吗?

凡奈斯机场,8点半

1123
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:03,490
今天的事只是生意,
Look,with everything that happened today,nothing personal,

1124
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,530
我会打理你们的钱财,然后我就走
I'll take care of your finances and then I'm out.

1125
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,120
- 好 - 这样可以
- Okay.- Fair enough.

1126
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,380
我现在正站在洛杉矶市区
I'm standing about a block awayfrom the Monroe office building

1127
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,050
距离门罗大楼一个街区
in downtown Los Angeles

1128
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:20,420
一小时前一位洛杉矶警察在楼里被枪杀

1132

- 老鬼行了
- Ghost.Easy.- What?

1133
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:36,650
目前无法确认,但嫌疑犯
Now,we can't confirm,at this hour,but the suspect...

1134
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:38,570
老鬼,你现在不假装我们是朋友了?
Ghost,we ain't gotta act like we friends anymore,do we?

1135
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,450
喂,生意是生意 钱是钱
Hey,business is business.Money is money.

1136
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,910
我可没说过我们是朋友
I never said we were friends.

1137

Hey,come on,take it easy!He's not worth it,all right?

1140
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,210
都把人叫上 离开这里吧
All right,let's get the fellas and get out of here.

1141

1149
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,760
叫他来
Get Ghost for me.

1150
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,760

1164
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,190
杰西!

01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,790

我们快走!
Come on,let's go!

1169
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,810
走 我随后就来
Go.I'm coming.

1170
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,190
走!

1171
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,440
快,快!
Come on,come on!

1172
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:01,190
A J呢?他在哪儿?
Where's A.J?Where's A.J?Where's...

1173
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:12,990
卧倒!
Down,get down!

1174
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:20,460
- 他们是什么人?- 听口音是俄国人!
- Shit!Who are these guys?- Sounds like Russians!

1175
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,420
杰克!去看看走廊
Jake!Check the hallway.

1176
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,210
我们把床抬起来,来!
Let's put these beds up,let's go!

1177
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,860
走廊有人守着!
We got a shotgun in the hallway!

1178
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,300
卧倒,卧倒!
Stay low,stay low!

1179
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:21,020
该死!我没子弹了!
Shit!I'm out of ammo!I'm out,I'm out!

1180
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,600
杰克呢?
Where's Jake?

1181
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,340
我们该走了,各位 我们该走了
We gotta go,fellas.We gotta go.

1182
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,940
老鬼让我们和俄国人火拼
Ghost set us up against the Russians.

1183
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,730
混蛋,他肯定也把计划提供给了他们
Son of a bitch,he must've sold them on the same plan.

1184
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,940
所以他们把调度员给他
That's why they gave him the dispatcher

1185
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,820
仓促抢劫 就是为了让我们先动手
and that big hurry-up was just to get us to do the job first.

1186
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,030
- 对,我们上当了 - 彻底上当了
- Yeah,and we bought it.- Yeah,all of it.

1187
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:02,740
这一片很快要封锁了
Shit,the heat's gonna be coming down now.

1188
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,910
是啊 我们机场见
I know.See you at the airport.

1189
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,850
莉莉?莉莉?
Lilli?Lilli?

1190
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:42,240
坚持住,亲爱的 起来
Hold on,baby.Oh,God,baby,get up.Baby.

1191
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,080
天啊,亲爱的,醒醒
Oh,my God,baby,wake up.Oh,just...

1192
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:53,000
该死的,钱不见了!
Goddamn,the money's gone!

1193
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,920
杰西,来帮帮我!
Jesse,help me!Help me!

1194
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,270
老鬼,我要杀了你 
Ghost.Ghost,I'm gonna kill you.Oh,God.

1195
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,940
杰克,有人来了
Jake,we got company.

1196
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:24,450
杰克,我们必须走了
Jake,we gotta go.We have to go.

1197
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:31,000
天,老鬼
Oh,God.Ghost.

1198
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:10,540
我们是洛杉矶警察慢慢走出房子
Los Angeles Police Department.Exit the building slowly.

1199
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,540
限你们20秒钟之内走出来
You have 20 seconds to come out.

1200
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,350
杰克,我看错了老鬼
Look,Jake.I was wrong about Ghost.

1201
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,890
对不起
I'm sorry,man.

1202
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,020
这不怪你
It's not your fault.

1203
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:47,320
杰西你不必陪我冒险
Jesse,you ain't gotta be down with me on this one.

1204
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:50,540
你要考虑自己未来的生活
You got your own life to think about,man.

1205
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,370
我说过了,绝不再回监狱
I already told you.I'm never going back.

1206
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,250
这就是我的生活
And this is my life.

1207
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,420
我的车在后面你的车呢?
My car's out back.Where's yours?

1208
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:04,800
在前面
In front.

1209
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:08,390
我们坐你的车
Let's take yours.

1210
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,350
知道你会这么说
Thought you'd say that.

1211
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,600
准备好了吗,兄弟?
You ready,bro?

1212
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:20,610
我们兄弟一起走吧
Just me and you,big brother.Let's go.

1213
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:00,750

1215
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,460
你怎么在这儿?没事吧?
What are you doing?Are you all right?

1216
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,260
- 他们不让我离开 - 我们必须走
- They won't let me in your building.- We've gotta go.

1217
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,090
来,我们上车
Come on,let's get in the car.All right.

1218
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,680
- 我只想回老家 - 好
- Just wanna go home.- All right.

1219
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,060
看见你了
There you are.

1220
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,810
- 说 - 我快到机场了
- Talk to me.- I'm almost to the airport.

1221
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,900
我也是
Yeah,me,too.

1222
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,820
我在琢磨一件事 听我简单说说?
Hey,I'm tripping.Hear me out right quick,all right?

1223
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,240
怎么了?
Yeah,what's up?

1224
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,650
老鬼一开始就在耍弄我们
Ghost has had the jump on us from the get-go,right?

1225
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:13,570
那他为什么把我们都干掉
So,why would he take us all out

1226
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,780
却只满足于得到04年的那笔钱呢?
and then only settle for the cash from the '04 job?

1227
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,540
- 他不会的 - 除非
- He wouldn't.- Unless...

1228
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:23,040
- 他打算把钱都拿走 - 钱都在斯考特那里
- Man,he plans on taking all the money.- Shit,Scott.Scott has all the money.

1229
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:25,080
没错 我这就去 跟着你去
Exactly.I'm on my way.I'm right behind you.

1230
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:33,550
我知道很晚了 让他和我在银行会面
I know this is a little last-minute.Have him meet me at the bank.

1231
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:40,270
斯考特,快接电话 接电话
Come on,Scott,pick up.Scott,pick up.

1232
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,020
我今晚就去
Yeah,I'm coming in tonight.

1233
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,730
你明天早上9点要有空,好吗?
You have to make yourself available at 9:00 a.m.Tomorrow,all right?

1234
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,190
你能做到吗?
Can you do that?

1235
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,610
我是斯考特 现在我不在
You've reached Scott.I'm away from my cell.

1236
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,190
斯考特,快接电话 真是的
Oh,God.No,Scott,pick up.Damn it.

1237
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,570
好
All right.

1238
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:58,660
好了我们走吧
Okay.Let's get out of here.

1239
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:04,790
今天累坏了 能给我倒一杯酒吗?
It's been a long day.Can you pour me a Scotch?

1240
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:30,520
你去哪儿? 你一定要独吞啊,老鬼?
Yeah,where are you going?You just had to have it all,didn't you,Ghost?

1241
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:32,820
- 我只是拿走我的钱!- 是吗?
- I'm just taking what's mine!- Oh,yeah?

1242
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,780
今天在街上就该打死你
I should've shot you on the street today.

1243
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:37,410
不,5年前你就该把我打死在楼梯上
Naw,you should've shot me five years ago on that fire escape.

1244
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:40,030
是你被抓住了,老鬼!你被抓住了!
You got caught,Ghost!You got caught!

1245
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:42,160
你知道我们的约定!
You knew the game when you was playing it!

1246
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,290
你们把我丢下不管!
You left me back there to die like I was shit!

1247
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,500
不是不管你!
You ain't shit,Ghost!

1248
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,040
我帮你把队伍组织起来!
I helped you put this crew together!

1249
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,080
你现在又想拆散队伍吗?
So what?Now you wanna take it apart?

1250
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:52,340
放下武器!警察!放下武器!
Drop the weapon!Drop it!Police!Put them down!

1251
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,050
- 放下!- 放下!
- Put them down!- Stay out of this!

1252
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:56,760
- 这是我俩的恩怨
- Better listen to him,cop.- It's between me and him.

1253
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,090
你干涉的话,我把你也杀了
If you interfere,I'm gonna kill you,too.

1254
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,010
- 最后说一遍,放下武器!
- Last time,drop them!- Shit.

1255
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:16,030
我还能怎么做,戈登?
What you expect me to do,G?Huh?

1256
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:21,070
拿走了我的钱 抢走了我的女人
You took my money.Took my bitch from me.

1257
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,030
把我赶出了队伍?
Just put me out the crew,huh?

1258
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,210
我以为我会忘记从前?
What you thought I was gonna do?Let that shit go?

1259
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:29,420
你被抓住了!
You got caught!

1260
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:33,960
好 我现在明白了
Yeah.A'ight.I see now.

1261
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,630
你只看成公事公办
It's all business for you.

1262
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,720
但我觉得是私人恩怨
Well,this shit just got real personal.

1263
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,570
- 你该等着我的 - 他干得太快了
- Should've waited for me,G.- The shit went too fast.

1264
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:57,030
等等,等等
Hold,hold it,hold it,hold it.

1265
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:59,820
别动!你别动!
Don't move!Don't you move!

1266
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,420
那天就是你跟踪我们
You're that cop with the little girl.

1267
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,800
你不该插手的
You should've stayed out of this.

1268
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,880
- 我们带上钱走吧 - 好
- Let's get that money and get out of here.- Yeah.

1269
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,000
救护中心
Emergency dispatch.

1270
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:57,800
对
Yeah.

1271
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:03,630
有警察受伤 凡奈斯机场12号机库
You got an officer down.Van Nuys Airport,hangar 12.

1272
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:08,390
我中枪了需要救助
I've been shot and I need help.

1273
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,480
马上就到
Units en route.

1274
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:13,770
我想帮忙
I want help.

1275
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:27,620
戈登?我们现在回老家吗?
G?Are we going home now?

1276
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:35,170
对,我们回老家
Yeah,baby.We're going home.

1277
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,380
情况怎么样?
Are we good,brother?

1278
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,340
一切都好
All signs point to it.
