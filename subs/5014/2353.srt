Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.

93
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,324
So, they used C-4 to knock out the elevtors.

94
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,364
Residue's being sent to the lab now.

Next Tuesday.

313
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,602
What?

314
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,438
Ghost, you want us to take down
n rmored truck in five days?

315
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,778
l mean, t's not even worth talking about
un ess you got the route,

316
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,044
and they change the route all the time.

317
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,518
-That's what screwed us lst time.
-Yeah man, you got the route?

318
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,784
l got it. Exct one from next Tuesday.

319
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,616
Any more questions?

320
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,119
-Howd you get it?
- ln the joint.

321
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,196
l got in good with this Russin.

322
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,127
Had the pleasure of keeping them guys
from Compton off h s ass.

323
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,235
ln exchange, he had h s comrades
on the outs de

324
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,601
put the rm down on the disptcher.

325
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,265
So the dispatcher do anything
to screw the job up

326
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,968
they're wiping out h s who e family
back at the Ukraine.

327
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,410
Down to the sheepdog.

328
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,038
Why should we trust the Russins?

329
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,577
They love their sheepdogs.

330
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,379
Al oullshit aside,

331
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,821
l'm in for a quarter mil with the Russians
out my cut when the job's done.

332
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,088
lt's not your concern,

333
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,789
so don't trust the Russians. Trust greed.

334
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,158
-Why shou d we trust you?
-We , shit, A.J.

335
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,134
l'm fresh out. l in t in no hurry to go bck.

336
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,400
Besides, why would l screw over my guys?

337
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,139
Especally when
you're hold ng all my money, right?

338
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,073
Okay. What about the setup?

339
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,079
l mean, there's knowing the route,
and then there's the logistics, you know.

340
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,276
F ve days Jake's right.
That's a rea , real short fuse.

341
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,478
That's where you come in.

342
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:05,114
But l trust that when you and Jake
put your heads together you'll figure it out.

343
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,856
Eitherway, l need to know tonight.

344
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,491
You ain't got the heart to pu l it off, ight.

345
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,025
Well sett e up on the money you owe me,
l'm sayonara.

346
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:21,332
Appreciate yourtime, gentlemen.
Thanks forthe cigar.

347
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,638
-Hey, G, et me check out that route.
- Yeah.

348
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:32,480
This is not the way we do things, gentlemen.
lt's too fast, it's too rushed

349
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,881
lts  lot of money,
but this whole th ng feels forced.

350
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,455
Five days? Five?

351
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,620
Yeah, man, but, you know,
we can get the setup right.

352
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,784
Bet big, win big.

353
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,350
lt's the only wy to ply.

354
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,394
We're takers, gents.
That's what we do for a iving.

355
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,325
We take.

356
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,827
lt's a lot of money, Jake.

357
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,199
-And that's what we're here for.
- You sure about this?

358
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,569
lf it checks out.

359
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,207
lf it checks out, l'm in.

360
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,358
- Yeah, wht's up?
-Thought you'd wanna know,

361
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,225
your Haitin buddy?

362
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,696
His lwyer just filed on you
for excessive force

363
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,030
All right. The guy was 6'5' he was resisting.

364
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,261
What ws l supposed to do?

365
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,927
Yeah, well, you mustve hurt his feelings.

366
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,065
The bank. Hey, isten, what about the C-4
they used to blow the elevators?

367
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,269
Well, from the taggants, forensics trced it
to a mining company out of Nevada

368
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,710
sto en about About two months go.

369
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,515
All right. And what about the mrked bills?

370
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,041
Bank finaly sent over a list.
Max is gonna fax out a memo right now.

371
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,015
L sten, man,

372
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,190
it's been a couple of weeks now.
You hear anything from Amanda?

373
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,521
L sten l apprecate it,
but l don't need any help.

374
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,930
We can work it out on ourown. But thanks.

375
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,133
All right. l'll tlk to you lter.

376
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,980
All right, so, for th s route
Ghost is talking about.

377
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,376
The on y place we stnd  chance
is right there.

378
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,976
-What's there?
-It's an o d subway carturnaround.

379
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,580
lt's lrge enough,
and it runs para lel to the street.

380
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,250
lt's kind of perfect.
l mean, we can get access on Hope Street,

381
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,919
but l say we ho d them up
at Olive and Fourth.

382
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:24,890
Al right.

383
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,329
And we need to get down there
first and get some intel on,

384
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,096
you know street patterns traffic density,
that sort of thing, but it ooks good.

385
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,503
Once we determine the blast radius
and street density,

386
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,474
l cn tell you how much C-4
you're gonna need to score

387
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,805
What about the exits?

388
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,946
Work in progress G.

389
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,676
You know, we got to get down there first,
check it out

390
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,585
-Give me some exits.
- You got it.

391
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,348
-lt's good work.
- Cool

392
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,781
-Al right gng.
- Good to go

393
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,425
Easy money, baby. Sme as before.

394
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,785
All the cash is in the front truck.

395
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,330
Second truck's totlly empty. Just n escort.

396
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,193
Two men up front, two men in the back.

397
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,929
Pump act on 12- gauge
and .40 ca iber Glocks.

398
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,259
Maybe 9mm.

399
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,969
They may have upgrded
their communication by now,

400
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,702
but the same stndard bulletproof windows.

401
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,640
They ain't gonna know what hit them.

402
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,883
Here we go. Must've tken up the trcks.

403
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,062
That's it.

404
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,216
Yeah, he's still working it.

405
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,654
Got brand- new wheels to show for it, too.

406
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,255
All rght, let's go.

509
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,865
They burned a bunch of stuff

510
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,269
Th s is all that was left.

525
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,751
Not only can we do it

585
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,932
The perp got shot on a fire escpe, right?

590
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,111
So, you think this guy's good

591
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,620
