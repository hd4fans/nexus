生活大爆炸
第七季  第十集

11
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,220
《生活大爆炸》前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory

12
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,450
谢尔顿  你这是想出了一个办法
Sheldon, did you just figure out a method

13
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,350
可以人工合成一种新型稳定超重元素吗
for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

14
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,910
是吗
Did I?

15
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,540
这不可能呀
Well, that can't be right.

16
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,960
从来没有人成功过呢
No one's ever done that before.

17
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,810
除了我  我想出来了
Except me, because I just did it!

18
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,620
谢尔顿谢尔顿脑力无边
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

19
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,650
谢尔顿谢尔顿脑震八方
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

20
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,070
我犯了个可怕的错误
I've made a horrible mistake.

21
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,410
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,190
这个表格是平方厘米制的
This table-- it's in square centimeters.

23
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,970
我看成了平方米
I read it as square meters.

24
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,440
知道这意味着什么吗
You know what that means?

25
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,420
美国人看不懂公制吗
That Americans can't handle the metric system?

26
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
艾米  我这是失之毫厘差之千里的错误  
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

27
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,770
但是中国研究小组发现了元素
But the Chinese team found the element.

28
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,950
他们不应该发现的
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

29
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,730
我的计算是错的
My calculations were wrong.

30
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,880
我这辈子最伟大的科学成就
the greatest scientific achievement of my life

31
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,370
是建立在一个巨大的错误之上
is based on a blunder.

32
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,900
我不是天才  
I'm not a genius,

33
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,770
我是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

34
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,840
谢尔顿  在神经系统学里
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

35
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,180
我们总是在大脑某处有所发现
we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

36
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,560
但地方和原来想的完全不一样
that we thought was someplace else.

37
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
这下可好  我连骗子都不如了
Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

38
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,990
我沦为生物学家之流了
I'm practically a biologist.

39
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,890
时至今日

40
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,410
欢迎收听《科学星期五》  我是艾拉・菲莱
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

41
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,120
今日的来宾是第一个
My guest today is responsible for the discovery

42
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,880
稳定超重元素的发现者
of the first stable super-heavy element.

43
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,810
欢迎谢尔顿・库伯博士
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

44
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,300
谢谢
Thank you.

45
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,560
是学校硬要我来的
Uh, the university made me come here.

46
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
我本人并不想来
I didn't want to.

47
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,840
我是这节目的忠实观众哦
Uh, big fan of the show.

48
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,950
我听说你之所以发现这元素
So, I understand that you actually discovered

49
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
完全是因为一个错误
this element by mistake.

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,770
是的
Yes.

51
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,690
而科学界有些人把这个错误称之为
And some people in the science community are calling it

52
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,940
-"蠢货奇迹"  -那些人是谁
- "The Wonder Blunder." - Who?

53
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,190
告诉我他们的名字
Give me their names.

54
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,220
肯定是沃罗威茨
I bet it's Wolowitz.

55
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
这故事真是太了不起了
It's just such a fascinating story.

56
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,640
你在计算上偏差了这么多
Your calculations are way off,

57
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,480
却还是有人找到了这元素
but they find the element anyway.

58
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,010
感觉就像是读错藏宝地图
It's like misreading a treasure map

59
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,570
却还是找到了宝藏一样
and still finding the treasure.

60
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,250
我们能聊别的话题吗
Can we talk about something else?

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,970
你知道我会唱山歌吗
Do you know that I yodel?

62
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,690
那不错啊  但这发现有可能
That's interesting, but this could be taking you

63
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340
让你获得诺贝尔奖
down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

64
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,430
而且是化学奖哦
And in chemistry, no less.

65
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,730
这种情况很少见吧
And wouldn't that be unusual?

66
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,830
因为你是物理学家
Because you're a physicist.

67
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,550
对对对  我将是获得诺贝尔化学奖的物理学家
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

68
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,710
大家快来笑我这个奇葩吧
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

69
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,420
我不需要坐在这忍受你的羞辱  菲莱
You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

70
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
就是因为有你这种恶霸
It is because of bullies like you,

71
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,360
所以每天才会有越来越多的
every day more and more Americans

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,710
美国人转投看电视
are making the switch to television.

73
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,810
塞伯特校长  你为什么要凶我
President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

74
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,130
是你叫我去上广播节目的
You're the one who made me go on the radio.

75
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,160
我以为那会是一场专业的科学访谈
I was expecting a professional science interview,

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,550
而不是被整人节目口无遮拦的主持人攻击
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

77
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,200
如果学校这么缺钱
Well, if the university needs money so badly,

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,690
或许你该设立个脏话罚款筒赚钱
perhaps you should start a swear jar.

79
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,390
你这一串脏话够罚一块钱啊
That one's worth a dollar.

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,810
我知道你不喜欢上节目
I know you don't like it,

81
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,330
但是你每次去接受采访
but every time you do an interview,

82
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,370
都能提大学提高知名度
it raises the profile of the university.

83
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,960
高知名度就有高资助费
That translates to funding.

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,890
我又不是受训的卖艺猴子
Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,710
帮他们乞讨钱
dancing for coins.

86
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,870
你当然不是啦
Of course you're not.

87
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,690
那种猴子多讨人喜欢
People love trained monkeys.

88
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,120
你有什么好不开心的啊
How can you not be happy?

89
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
你又高又瘦又出名
You're tall, thin and famous.

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,780
天啊  我好嫉妒谢尔顿
Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,000
这些访谈估计还持续一段时间
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
你得找到习惯这些事的方法
You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

93
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,330
但你们没人能懂我的心情
But none of you know what this is like.

94
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,360
自己悔恨不已的事却被人大肆赞扬
Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
想必你没跟我一起去过狂欢节
Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

96
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
要暂停一下游戏来帮忙我打扫吗
Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,350
我正在打扫啊
I am cleaning up.

98
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,870
打扫小丑对高谭市造成的破坏
Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

99
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,860
拜托  要来暂住的可是你的朋友
Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,150
拉杰是在印度长大的
Raj grew up in India.

101
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,180
相信我  比这更脏的他都见过
Trust me, he's seen worse.

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
华仔
Howie.

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,920
我保证这周接下来的日子我会帮忙
I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,810
这周接下来的日子
The rest of the week?

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,430
你不是说就一两天吗
You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

106
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,540
但如果我直接跟你说住一周
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

107
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,060
-你会同意吗  -当然不会
- would you have said yes? - No!

108
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,250
所以我只好出此下策啦
Then you left me no choice.

109
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,980
我喜欢拉杰  但他这暂住也太久了吧
I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

110
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,570
但他的公寓整个楼都在除虫  没法住
I know, but they're tenting his building.

111
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,220
他也找不到能让带宠物的酒店
He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

112
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,550
他还带小桂子来啊
He's bringing Cinnamon?

113
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,570
待一整周呢
For a whole week!

114
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,340
有些人真是大惊小怪
The nerve of some people.

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,530
迎面而来的是羞愧号快车
Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

116
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,700
将会经过  骗子镇站
With stops at Fraudville...

117
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,220
蠢货奇迹山站
WonderBlunderberg...

118
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,040
以及堪萨斯城
and Kansas City.

119
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,350
只因这是运输交汇处
Because it's a hub.

120
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
谢尔顿  我能进来吧
Sheldon, can I come in?

121
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,710
-你有带饼干吗  -没有
- Do you have cookies? - No.

122
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,850
很好  我不配吃饼干  进来吧
Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,080
-威尔...  -谢尔顿
- Wil...? - Hey, Sheldon.

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,310
好久不见
It's been a while.

125
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,590
你怎么来了
Why are you here?

126
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,070
艾米说你最近不开心
Amy said you were having a rough time,

127
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,230
我就想来开导开导你
and I thought maybe we could talk.

128
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,470
可以吗
Is that okay?

129
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,940
当然可以
Certainly.

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
虽然...
Although...

131
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,130
现在我就不开心
right now, I'm having a rough time

132
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,840
因为我房间现在有三个人
because there's three people in my room,

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,760
感觉跟迪斯科舞厅一样拥挤
and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,420
谢尔顿  你说你不开心是因为
Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

135
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,690
人们都在关注让你悔恨不已的事
for something you wished you never did.

136
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,620
关于这事  我也有点经验
Yeah, I know a little something about that.

137
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,800
少来了  威尔
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,700
你的刷屏微博也没那么糟啦
Your endless tweets are not that bad.

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,140
我想起这么久不见他的原因了
I remember why it's been a while.

140
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,270
谢尔顿  我要说的是
Sheldon, I was actually talking

141
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,400
我小时候在星际迷航里演出的事
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

142
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
你怎么会不喜欢因为出演该电影
How could you not like getting attention

143
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,850
而获得大家的关注呢
for playing Wesley Crusher?

144
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,270
你的角色很讨喜啊
You were wonderful.

145
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,210
一个全知全能记忆超强的男孩
A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,580
谁对那个角色会没有代入感啊
Who couldn't relate to that?

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
不是每个人都这么想的
Well, not everybody felt that way.

148
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,870
很多人很讨厌那个角色
A lot of people really hated the character,

149
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,110
因此有些人也为此而讨厌我
and some of them hated me because of it.

150
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,190
我也曾接受过访谈
I would do interviews,

151
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,130
很多人都会嘲讽我
and people would be mean to me.

152
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,170
我也碰到这种事了
That just happened to me.

153
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,770
下次你想不出刷什么屏了
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

154
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,880
欢迎你写一条艾拉・菲莱是混蛋的微博
feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,440
谢尔顿  重点的是威尔能学会接受现实
Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life

156
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,070
然后更重要的东西迈进
and moved on to bigger and better things.

157
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,220
是啊  我现在是个作家
Yeah, I'm an author now,

158
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,420
经常公开演讲
I do public speaking,

159
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,230
我自己还出了一部关于桌游的网络剧
and I have my own web series about board games.

160
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,550
我们是要哄他开心  所以...
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

161
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,400
我只是想告诉你  曾有一段时间  
I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
我以为自己走不出那角色的阴影
I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,550
但现在
But now,

164
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,310
那只是我完美人生中的一小章节
it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

165
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,850
我也很开心有过那些经历
and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

166
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,020
我明白你的意思
I do see what you're saying.

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,350
挺受用的
That helps.

168
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,580
那就好
Good.

169
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,790
你们俩个要留下来一起玩火车吗
Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?

170
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,670
-好  -可以啊
- Sure. - Okay.

171
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,050
太好了
Oh, great!

172
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,660
现在呢
Now...

173
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,080
我来操作控制器
I work the controls.

174
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,330
我来喊"请上车"
I say "All aboard",

175
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,800
你们俩安静坐着看就行了
you sit quietly and watch.

176
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
我能吹哨子吗
Can I blow the whistle?

177
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,210
你还是走吧
You should probably go.

178
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,590
你要在我家沙发上刷牙吗
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?

179
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,880
我是要刷小桂子的牙
No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.

180
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,660
何苦呢
Why bother?

181
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,070
她有一半的时间都是在舔屁眼
She spends half the time licking her butt.

182
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,690
另一半的时间是在舔我脸
And the other half licking my face.

183
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,370
所以我才要帮她刷牙
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

184
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,530
抱歉  我回来晚了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

185
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,480
你们吃完饭了吗
Did you already have dinner?

186
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,230
没  我们在等你
No, we were waiting for you.

187
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,580
你们真好
Aw, that's so sweet.

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,860
所以你今晚打算煮什么呢
Yeah. So what do you feel like making?

189
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,800
霍华德  这可怜的姑娘刚忙完回家
Howard, the poor thing just got home from work.

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,770
我先给你倒杯酒
Let me get you a glass of wine.

191
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,750
然后我来做晚餐
I'll cook dinner.

192
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,150
-拉杰  你可是客人  -没关系啦
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest. - Don't be silly.

193
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,180
快坐下  你看上去很累
Sit. You look like you've had a long day.

194
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,990
没事啦  她经常这样
No, she always looks like that.

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,400
因为她嫁了个傻逼
Because she married an idiot.

196
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,680
谢谢  拉杰
Thank you, Raj.

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,900
客气啥  就当是我感谢你们
Please, this is my way of thanking you

198
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,380
让我住在这里吧
for letting me stay here.

199
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,520
跟我们说说你今天过得怎么样
Now, tell us all about your day.

200
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,810
好的  首先我开会迟到了
Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting

201
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,890
因为在路上堵车了
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

202
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,240
我就叫你在手机装一个交通实时监控软件嘛
Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.

203
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,020
你今天回家抱怨  因为吃太多糖豆
Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick

204
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,370
而肚子不舒服时
from eating too many jelly beans,

205
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,650
我有教你怎么解决问题吗
did I tell you how to fix it?

206
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,250
没有
No.

207
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,840
相反  我说"小可怜  一定很疼吧"
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"

208
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,140
然后帮你揉肚肚
and I rubbed your belly.

209
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
我全程都在想着你
I thought of you the whole time.

210
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,450
我的意思是  有时你只需去倾听
All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.

211
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,280
多谢
Thank you.

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,540
有时你也得适可而止  别吃那么多糖豆
There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans.

213
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,650
"有时"是指十岁以后
And it's when you're ten.

214
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,170
塞伯特校长
Hello, President Siebert.

215
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,680
谢谢您接听我的电话
Thank you for taking my call.

216
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,070
我只是想让您知道  您现在可以指望我
I just wanted you to know that you can now expect

217
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,330
热心参与有关我的发现的一切活动了
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery.

218
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,520
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

219
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,690
无需感谢我
No need to thank me.

220
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,680
要谢就谢我的朋友  威尔・惠顿
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

221
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,870
向您报告一下  我有九个朋友
For your information, I have nine friends, hmm?

222
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,700
算上您的话  就十个
Ten if we include you.

223
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,430
那就九个吧
Nine it is.

224
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,800
还是十个吧  算上沃罗威茨好了
Ah, it's ten. I'll count Wolowitz.

225
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,510
你好  朋友莱纳德
Hello, friend Leonard.

226
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,870
你心情不错嘛
Hey, you're in a good mood.

227
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,610
我心情超棒的
I'm in a great mood.

228
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,980
那你的心情即将变得更棒
Well, you're about to be in an even better one.

229
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,670
我是现在确定了才敢告诉你
I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure,

230
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,480
但
but...

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
我在我实验室重新测试了你的元素
I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab

232
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,680
我证明了它不存在
and I disproved it.

233
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,290
你的元素根本不存在
Your element does not exist!

234
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,570
是吗  但中国的研究小组呢
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team?

235
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,520
他们的确发现了啊
They found it.

236
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
结果证明是有人在
Yeah, it turns out someone added

237
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,200
数据文件里加入了模拟信号
simulated signals to the data files.

238
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,070
他们伪造了结果
They faked the results.

239
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,740
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yes!

240
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,590
你知道这意味着什么吗
Do you know what that means?

241
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,830
你讨厌的所有关注  通通都会消失
That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.

242
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,960
所以不会再有访问吗
So no more interviews?

243
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
对  全都结束了
No, it's all over.

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,100
真是难以置信
I can't believe it.

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,990
不用客气
Well, you're welcome.

246
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,860
你夺走了我这辈子最大的成就
You robbed me of my greatest achievement!

247
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,220
什么
What?!

248
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,720
我现在只有九个朋友了
I'm back down to nine friends!

249
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,990
算了  八个吧  我也不喜欢沃罗威茨
Make it eight-- I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

250
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,660
我不明白了
I-I don't understand.

251
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,330
自从你发现这个该死的元素后
All you've done since you discovered

252
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,750
你就一直在抱怨个不停
this stupid element was complain.

253
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,200
我只是想让你开心
I was trying to make you happy!

254
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,850
所以要夺走我唯一成名的机会吗
By taking away my only claim to fame?

255
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,450
如果你想让我开心
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

256
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,750
你可以跟我讲个笑话
you could have told me a joke.

257
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,910
或是给我看一段有爱的视频
Or shown me a cute video

258
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,230
比如考拉和水獭
of a koala and an otter

259
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
破天荒地成为朋友
becoming unlikely friends.

260
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,170
你总是最有理那个
Oh, there is no winning with you.

261
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,420
而且考拉和水獭居住地差了十万八千里
And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

262
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,690
所以它们成为朋友才是破天荒之举
That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

263
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,420
你们俩在吵什么啊
What's with all the yelling?

264
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,430
莱纳德推翻了我的发现
Leonard disproved my element.

265
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,640
现在所有的关注都要消失了
Now all the attention is going to go away.

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
这很好啊  你一定很激动吧
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,390
很好  我现在只剩七个朋友了
That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

268
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,690
他是连霍比特人和超级英雄都算上了吧
He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?

269
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,550
一开始我以为元素是真实存在的  我不想要它
When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

270
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,570
但现在莱纳德证实它并不存在
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

271
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,690
它反而成了我全世界最想要的东西了
I want it more than anything in the world.

272
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,510
那元素从来就不存在
The-the element never existed.

273
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,450
不是我夺走它  而是科学夺走了它
I didn't take it away, science took it away.

274
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,610
要气就气科学吧
Be mad at science.

275
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,620
你胆敢用科学来反驳我
Don't you dare use science against me.

276
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,880
科学可是我最好的朋友
Science is my best friend!

277
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,770
太好了  我又有八个朋友了
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

278
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,010
你能告诉他  他疯了吗
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

279
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,320
老实说  我理解他的意思
Actually, I get what he's saying.

280
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
太棒了  变九个了
Oh, yes! Nine!

281
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
欢迎回来  朋友
Welcome back, buddy.

282
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,320
就像跟一个你不是很喜欢的人约会
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

283
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,290
等那人跟你分手了
and then they break up with you

284
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,600
你就变得很想要那人了
and then you want them more than ever.

285
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,540
我完全不知道她在说什么
I have no idea what she's talking about.

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,120
但我们现在联手对付你  所以我赞成她的话
but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,790
谢尔顿  那你要我怎么样
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

288
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,230
隐瞒我的发现吗
hide the information?

289
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,100
如果我不公布
If I don't publish it,

290
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,140
迟早其他人也会这么做的
it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

291
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,910
不  你当然得公布
No, no, of course you have to publish.

292
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,770
那是你作为一个科学家应尽的责任
That's your responsibility as a scientist.

293
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
否则会违背职业道德
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

294
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,560
你别无选择
You have no choice.

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,580
好吧  我会公布
Fine, I'll publish.

296
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,380
你看这没良心的混球
Can you believe this guy?

297
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,770
拉杰把碗都洗了
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

298
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,140
你怎么知道不是我洗的
How do you know I didn't do them?

299
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,750
因为有一次  所有刀子都没洗
Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

300
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,160
你宁愿用钥匙切面包圈  也懒得洗
you cut a bagel with your keys.

301
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,030
早上好  两位
Good morning, everybody.

302
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,160
我出去的时候  顺便买了咖啡
I picked up coffee while I was out.

303
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,200
伯纳黛特  这是你的大豆薄荷摩卡
Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

304
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,540
你真是太客气了
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

305
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,290
乐意之至
Oh, my pleasure,

306
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,340
对了  不要担心今天的演讲
and don't worry about your presentation today.

307
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,390
你一定会表现出色
You're gonna be great.

308
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,460
对啊  你一定能震惊四座
Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

309
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,830
我今天要做什么演讲来着
What presentation do I have today?

310
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,890
快走吧
Just go.

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,420
他很爱你的
He loves you.

312
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,130
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

313
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,680
你是故意让我难堪吗
Are you trying to make me look bad?

314
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,820
我只是想当个好客人
I'm just being a good house guest.

315
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
不  你是想当一个比我还好的丈夫
No, you're being a better husband than I am.

316
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,320
洗碗  买咖啡
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

317
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
对她的生活了如指掌
knowing about her life--

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,160
谁会那样做啊
who does that?

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
别这样嘛  我也给你买了一杯
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

320
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,910
我不想喝咖啡
I don't want coffee.

321
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,210
所以我给你买了热巧克力
That's why I got you hot chocolate.

322
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,690
快给我
Give me that.

323
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,020
不许什么都做得比我好
Just stop showing me up.

324
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,590
霍华德  听我说
Howard, listen to me.

325
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
你是一个很棒的丈夫
You're a great husband.

326
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,810
没错  你倾听的技巧还需要多练练
Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

327
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,090
但作为一个独生子
But it's amazing how far you've come

328
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,850
还有一个过度保护的老妈
given that you're an only child

329
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,970
你算做得很不错啦
raised by an over-protective mom.

330
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,660
这情形好像有点奇怪啊
Um, is this getting weird?

331
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,200
别动
Hang on.

332
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
的确是很怪
So, yes.

333
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,250
我想告诉你一声  我发表了我的发现
I just wanted to let you know that I-I posted my findings.

334
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,790
我看见了
I saw.

335
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,780
我刚发公告  要求撤回我的论文
And I just posted a retraction of my paper.

336
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,810
现在整个科学界都知道我是错的
Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

337
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,000
这样的事情经常发生  谢尔顿
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,580
不是发生在我身上
Not to me.

339
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,490
我之前唯一一次公告的撤回说明
The only other retraction I ever had to issue

340
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,310
还是在我7岁的时候  我承认我哥哥
was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

341
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,220
是东德州最优秀的忍者
was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

342
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,180
但那只是把我的脸
But that was just a ploy

343
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,230
从他的臭腋窝里拯救出来的权宜之计
to get my face out of his armpit.

344
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,000
他在这里啊
There he is!

345
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,100
我最爱的超级英雄
It's my favorite superhero--

346
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
撤回侠
the Retractor!

347
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,250
拜托  别落井下石了
Come on, don't give him a hard time.

348
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,880
对不起  库珀
I'm sorry, Cooper.

349
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
我撤回刚才说的话
I retract it.

350
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,780
顺便说下  霍夫斯塔德
By the way, Hofstadter,

351
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,320
做得真棒  推翻了中国研究组的结果
nice job disproving the Chinese team.

352
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,260
不算什么
It's not a big deal.

353
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,450
这可是大事
It's a huge deal.

354
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,190
库珀  也许你不太适合研究物理
Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

355
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,660
有没有考虑转去做零售
Have you ever considered a career in retail?

356
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,510
这样你就能靠撤回东西过生活了
That way you could take things back for a living.

357
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,320
好了  巴里  太过了
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
不  没事
Oh, no, that's okay.

359
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
我可以打赢自己的战斗
I can fight my own battles.

360
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,320
对吗  "八尼"  
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

361
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,610
你这是
Is...?

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,690
在嘲笑我的语言障碍吗
Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

363
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,790
太伤人了
That's pretty hurtful.

364
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,600
我
I...

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,380
我自己没法控制
I can't control it.

366
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,100
你说得对
You're right,

367
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,410
这招太卑鄙了
That was uncalled for.

368
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,680
我收回
I take it back.

369
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,450
你当然要收回了
Of course you do.

370
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,840
因为你是鼎鼎大名的撤回侠
Because you're the Retractor!

371
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,030
拉杰  晚餐的味道太好了
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

372
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,020
如果你多住一段时间
If you're here much longer,

373
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,490
我得买大一号的衣服了
I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

374
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,710
瞎说
Nonsense.

375
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
你需要长点肉
You need a little fattening up.

376
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,410
你最近太瘦了
You've been looking too skinny lately.

377
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,060
华仔  你怎么从来不会说这些哄人开心的话
Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

378
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
说什么呢
What are you talking about?

379
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
记得上周  我问你
Remember last week, when I asked you

380
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,850
你是否穿了塑身衣  你却没穿吗
if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

381
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,400
这明明就是夸你苗条嘛
How's that different?

382
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,030
也许你可以学学你的朋友拉杰
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

383
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,500
更体贴一些
like your friend Raj.

384
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,310
也许你可以学学拉杰
Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

385
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,820
-是吗  -当然
- Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

386
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,370
他今天早上为我打包了午餐
He packed me a lunch this morning.

387
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,120
袋子里有张字条写着  "勇敢上吧"
And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em"

388
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,500
我为这个家做得还不够多吗
Like I don't do enough around here.

389
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,780
现在还要为你打包午餐吗
Now I need to pack your lunch?

390
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,500
而且  你为什么需要字条来告诉你
And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

391
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,930
"勇敢上吧"  你是个大老爷们
to "Go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

392
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,450
你应该知道要"勇敢上吧"
You should know to "Go get 'em"!

393
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,510
我的确知道"勇敢上吧"
I do know to "Go get 'em"

394
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,310
只是有时候  我"勇敢"去"上"的同时
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

395
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,060
有精神支持感觉会更好
when I'm going and getting them!

396
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,980
别这样  瞧你们在说些什么话
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

397
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,780
咱们冷静下  都各退一步
Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

398
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,610
太傻了  我们为什么要吵架
This is stupid. Why are we fighting?

399
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,530
我不知道
I don't know.

400
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,850
我想是因为我觉得自己是个差劲的老公
I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.

401
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,160
你不是差劲的老公
You're not a lousy husband.

402
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
你是个非常棒的老公
You're a great husband.

403
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,170
我才觉得自己是个差劲的老婆
I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

404
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,200
开什么玩笑  你最棒了
Are you kidding? You're the best.

405
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,630
我知道问题在哪里
I know what the problem is.

406
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,130
都怪他
It's him!

407
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,170
我做了什么
Oh, what did I do?

408
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,050
你让我们觉得  我们经营婚姻不够用心
You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

409
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,470
我们之前很满意我们打混摸鱼的婚姻
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

410
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,130
直到你这个祸害出现
till you showed up.

411
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,970
我很抱歉让你们生气了
Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

412
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,600
但我得说  看到你们统一战线
but I just have to say it's nice to see

413
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
真是太好了
the two of you on the same page.

414
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,240
你能支持我一次
Oh, it does feel good to have you

415
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,650
的确感觉不错
backing me up for once.

416
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,500
-我总是支持你好吧  -那不是...
－ I back you up all the time! - That is not...

417
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,660
-他又在挖坑  -你这人太坏了
- He's doing it again! - What is wrong with you?!

418
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,760
真不敢相信他们把你赶出来了
I can't believe they kicked you out.

419
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,660
真不敢相信他们还没离婚
I can't believe they're still married.

420
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,860
不好  我把小桂子的牙刷忘在霍华德家了
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

421
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,920
看来你又要和爸比共用一把牙刷啦
I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

422
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,370
要我打电话给反虐待动物协会就吠一声
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

423
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
那只动物在咱们家干嘛
What's that animal doing in our apartment?

424
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,480
放轻松  她在笼子里  出不来的
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

425
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,430
送你几个字送给你
I have two words for you:

426
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,040
侏罗纪公园[恐龙逃出]
Jurassic Park.

427
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,640
今天真是越来越糟糕
This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

428
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,200
如果这话能让你感觉好点...
You know, if it makes you feel any better...

429
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,170
可能不会
It probably won't.

430
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,270
你可能是对的
You're probably right.

431
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,340
谢尔顿  今晚夜色不错
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

432
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,940
我们出去散步好吗
Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

433
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,700
你这人怎么整天淫虫上脑啊
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

434
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,620
谢尔顿  你得意识到  
Sheldon, I think you might find the support

435
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,220
想在恋爱中得到多少扶持
you're looking for, if you realize that

436
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,450
全取决于自己有多少付出
relationships are a give and take.

437
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,820
你有多支持她
She can only be there for you

438
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,910
她也会有多支持你
as much as you are for her.

439
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,580
谢谢你  拉杰什
Thank you, Rajesh.

440
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,960
艾米  你对待谢尔顿也要有耐心
And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

441
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,980
而不是对他施压  
instead of pressuring him

442
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,750
让他接受你的这一套亲密观
to accept intimacy on your terms.

443
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,770
你还是走人吧
You should probably go.

444
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,540
我是艾拉・菲莱  这里是《科学星期五》节目
I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

445
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,190
欢迎谢尔顿・库珀博士再次前来
I'd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

446
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,100
他以为自己发现了一种新的超重元素  
who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element

447
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,770
不料却被另一位嘉宾莱纳德・霍夫斯塔德
only to have it disproved by my next guest,

448
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,950
证明是错的
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

449
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,600
先生们  欢迎来到《科学星期五》做客
Welcome to Science Friday, gentlemen.

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,750
-谢谢  -谢谢你
- Thanks. - Thank you.

451
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,910
艾拉  容我说一句  我想为  
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

452
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,550
我上周的行为道歉
for my behavior last week.

453
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,580
没关系
It's all right.

454
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,340
你有没有什么话想对我说
Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

455
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,220
没有
No.

456
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,650
霍夫斯塔德博士
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

457
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,020
你能讲述一遍你推翻
Can you walk us through the process

458
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,190
他理论的实验过程吗
you used to disprove his theory?

459
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,700
-好的  -我可以回答这个问题
- Well... - I believe I can answer that.

460
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,030
他问的是我
He asked me.

461
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,080
好的
Fine.

462
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,980
我刚才在说
As I was saying...

463
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,650
你讲得不好  艾拉
You're telling it wrong. Ira...

464
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,660
要想好好理解这件事
to really understand the story here,

465
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,340
就得从最开始讲起
you have to start at the very beginning:

466
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,200
在东德州的一个小镇  一位年幼的天才叫做
A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

467
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,380
-谢尔顿  -没错  谢尔顿・库珀
- Sheldon... - That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

468
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,380
他被邻居家的狗咬了
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

469
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,340
这让他有了第一次科学方面的大突破
leading to his first scientific breakthrough--

470
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,690
狗狗死亡射线
the doggie death-ray.

471
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,920
可悲的是  他不能使之成为现实
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

472
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,120
因为圣诞老人没有送他浓缩铀
because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

473
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
你没意见的话  我真的很想听
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

474
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,140
霍夫斯塔德博士说说
if it's okay with you.

475
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,700
好意外啊
What a surprise.

476
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,660
你邀请我回来  就是为了无视我吗
Did-did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

477
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,230
事实上  我根本没有邀请你
Actually, I didn't invite you.

478
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,630
你走进来  自己坐下  
You came in, you took a seat,

479
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,660
我不太喜欢这种唇枪舌剑
and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.

480
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,970
谢尔顿  这次采访的重点是我
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.

481
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,610
听起来多无趣啊
Well, that seems like a snooze.

482
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,290
在无聊的电台上都显得无聊
Even for public radio.

483
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,700
如果他们每说一句丢人的话
You know, if we did a shot every time

484
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,050
我们就干一杯
they said something embarrassing,

485
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,280
那这游戏绝对能把人喝到酒精中毒
this would be one hell of a drinking game.

486
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,070
现在喝酒太早了吧
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

487
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,140
我可不仅只会发表科学方面的高明见解
You know, I don't just say smart things about science.

488
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,520
我还会唱山歌
I also yodel.

489
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,560
我去拿伏特加
I'll get the vodka.
