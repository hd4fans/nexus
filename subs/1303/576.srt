生活大爆炸
第七季  第十集

11
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,220
《生活大爆炸》前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory

12
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,450
謝爾頓  你這是想出了一個辦法
Sheldon, did you just figure out a method

13
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,350
可以人工合成一種新型穩定超重元素嗎
for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

14
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,910
是嗎
Did I?

15
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,540
這不可能呀
Well, that can't be right.

16
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,960
從來沒有人成功過呢
No one's ever done that before.

17
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,810
除了我  我想出來了
Except me, because I just did it!

18
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,620
謝爾頓謝爾頓腦力無邊
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

19
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,650
謝爾頓謝爾頓腦震八方
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

20
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,070
我犯了個可怕的錯誤
I've made a horrible mistake.

21
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,410
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,190
這個表格是平方厘米制的
This table-- it's in square centimeters.

23
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,970
我看成了平方米
I read it as square meters.

24
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,440
知道這意味著什么嗎
You know what that means?

25
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,420
美國人看不懂公制嗎
That Americans can't handle the metric system?

26
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
艾米  我這是失之毫厘差之千里的錯誤  
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

27
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,770
但是中國研究小組發現了元素
But the Chinese team found the element.

28
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,950
他們不應該發現的
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

29
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,730
我的計算是錯的
My calculations were wrong.

30
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,880
我這輩子最偉大的科學成就
the greatest scientific achievement of my life

31
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,370
是建立在一個巨大的錯誤之上
is based on a blunder.

32
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,900
我不是天才  
I'm not a genius,

33
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,770
我是個騙子
I'm a fraud.

34
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,840
謝爾頓  在神經系統學里
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

35
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,180
我們總是在大腦某處有所發現
we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

36
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,560
但地方和原來想的完全不一樣
that we thought was someplace else.

37
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
這下可好  我連騙子都不如了
Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

38
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,990
我淪為生物學家之流了
I'm practically a biologist.

39
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,890
時至今日

40
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,410
歡迎收聽《科學星期五》  我是艾拉·菲萊
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

41
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,120
今日的來賓是第一個
My guest today is responsible for the discovery

42
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,880
穩定超重元素的發現者
of the first stable super-heavy element.

43
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,810
歡迎謝爾頓·庫伯博士
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

44
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,300
謝謝
Thank you.

45
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,560
是學校硬要我來的
Uh, the university made me come here.

46
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
我本人并不想來
I didn't want to.

47
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,840
我是這節目的忠實觀眾哦
Uh, big fan of the show.

48
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,950
我聽說你之所以發現這元素
So, I understand that you actually discovered

49
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
完全是因為一個錯誤
this element by mistake.

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,770
是的
Yes.

51
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,690
而科學界有些人把這個錯誤稱之為
And some people in the science community are calling it

52
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,940
-"蠢貨奇跡"  -那些人是誰
- "The Wonder Blunder." - Who?

53
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,190
告訴我他們的名字
Give me their names.

54
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,220
肯定是沃羅威茨
I bet it's Wolowitz.

55
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
這故事真是太了不起了
It's just such a fascinating story.

56
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,640
你在計算上偏差了這么多
Your calculations are way off,

57
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,480
卻還是有人找到了這元素
but they find the element anyway.

58
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,010
感覺就像是讀錯藏寶地圖
It's like misreading a treasure map

59
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,570
卻還是找到了寶藏一樣
and still finding the treasure.

60
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,250
我們能聊別的話題嗎
Can we talk about something else?

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,970
你知道我會唱山歌嗎
Do you know that I yodel?

62
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,690
那不錯啊  但這發現有可能
That's interesting, but this could be taking you

63
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340
讓你獲得諾貝爾獎
down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

64
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,430
而且是化學獎哦
And in chemistry, no less.

65
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,730
這種情況很少見吧
And wouldn't that be unusual?

66
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,830
因為你是物理學家
Because you're a physicist.

67
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,550
對對對  我將是獲得諾貝爾化學獎的物理學家
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

68
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,710
大家快來笑我這個奇葩吧
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

69
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,420
我不需要坐在這忍受你的羞辱  菲萊
You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

70
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
就是因為有你這種惡霸
It is because of bullies like you,

71
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,360
所以每天才會有越來越多的
every day more and more Americans

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,710
美國人轉投看電視
are making the switch to television.

73
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,810
塞伯特校長  你為什么要兇我
President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

74
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,130
是你叫我去上廣播節目的
You're the one who made me go on the radio.

75
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,160
我以為那會是一場專業的科學訪談
I was expecting a professional science interview,

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,550
而不是被整人節目口無遮攔的主持人攻擊
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

77
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,200
如果學校這么缺錢
Well, if the university needs money so badly,

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,690
或許你該設立個臟話罰款筒賺錢
perhaps you should start a swear jar.

79
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,390
你這一串臟話夠罰一塊錢啊
That one's worth a dollar.

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,810
我知道你不喜歡上節目
I know you don't like it,

81
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,330
但是你每次去接受采訪
but every time you do an interview,

82
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,370
都能提大學提高知名度
it raises the profile of the university.

83
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,960
高知名度就有高資助費
That translates to funding.

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,890
我又不是受訓的賣藝猴子
Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,710
幫他們乞討錢
dancing for coins.

86
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,870
你當然不是啦
Of course you're not.

87
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,690
那種猴子多討人喜歡
People love trained monkeys.

88
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,120
你有什么好不開心的啊
How can you not be happy?

89
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
你又高又瘦又出名
You're tall, thin and famous.

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,780
天啊  我好嫉妒謝爾頓
Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,000
這些訪談估計還持續一段時間
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
你得找到習慣這些事的方法
You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

93
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,330
但你們沒人能懂我的心情
But none of you know what this is like.

94
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,360
自己悔恨不已的事卻被人大肆贊揚
Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
想必你沒跟我一起去過狂歡節
Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

96
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
要暫停一下游戲來幫忙我打掃嗎
Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,350
我正在打掃啊
I am cleaning up.

98
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,870
打掃小丑對高譚市造成的破壞
Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

99
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,860
拜托  要來暫住的可是你的朋友
Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,150
拉杰是在印度長大的
Raj grew up in India.

101
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,180
相信我  比這更臟的他都見過
Trust me, he's seen worse.

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
華仔
Howie.

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,920
我保證這周接下來的日子我會幫忙
I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,810
這周接下來的日子
The rest of the week?

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,430
你不是說就一兩天嗎
You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

106
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,540
但如果我直接跟你說住一周
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

107
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,060
-你會同意嗎  -當然不會
- would you have said yes? - No!

108
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,250
所以我只好出此下策啦
Then you left me no choice.

109
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,980
我喜歡拉杰  但他這暫住也太久了吧
I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

110
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,570
但他的公寓整個樓都在除蟲  沒法住
I know, but they're tenting his building.

111
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,220
他也找不到能讓帶寵物的酒店
He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

112
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,550
他還帶小桂子來啊
He's bringing Cinnamon?

113
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,570
待一整周呢
For a whole week!

114
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,340
有些人真是大驚小怪
The nerve of some people.

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,530
迎面而來的是羞愧號快車
Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

116
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,700
將會經過  騙子鎮站
With stops at Fraudville...

117
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,220
蠢貨奇跡山站
WonderBlunderberg...

118
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,040
以及堪薩斯城
and Kansas City.

119
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,350
只因這是運輸交匯處
Because it's a hub.

120
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
謝爾頓  我能進來吧
Sheldon, can I come in?

121
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,710
-你有帶餅干嗎  -沒有
- Do you have cookies? - No.

122
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,850
很好  我不配吃餅干  進來吧
Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,080
-威爾...  -謝爾頓
- Wil...? - Hey, Sheldon.

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,310
好久不見
It's been a while.

125
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,590
你怎么來了
Why are you here?

126
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,070
艾米說你最近不開心
Amy said you were having a rough time,

127
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,230
我就想來開導開導你
and I thought maybe we could talk.

128
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,470
可以嗎
Is that okay?

129
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,940
當然可以
Certainly.

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
雖然...
Although...

131
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,130
現在我就不開心
right now, I'm having a rough time

132
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,840
因為我房間現在有三個人
because there's three people in my room,

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,760
感覺跟迪斯科舞廳一樣擁擠
and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,420
謝爾頓  你說你不開心是因為
Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

135
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,690
人們都在關注讓你悔恨不已的事
for something you wished you never did.

136
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,620
關于這事  我也有點經驗
Yeah, I know a little something about that.

137
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,800
少來了  威爾
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,700
你的刷屏微博也沒那么糟啦
Your endless tweets are not that bad.

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,140
我想起這么久不見他的原因了
I remember why it's been a while.

140
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,270
謝爾頓  我要說的是
Sheldon, I was actually talking

141
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,400
我小時候在星際迷航里演出的事
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

142
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
你怎么會不喜歡因為出演該電影
How could you not like getting attention

143
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,850
而獲得大家的關注呢
for playing Wesley Crusher?

144
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,270
你的角色很討喜啊
You were wonderful.

145
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,210
一個全知全能記憶超強的男孩
A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,580
誰對那個角色會沒有代入感啊
Who couldn't relate to that?

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
不是每個人都這么想的
Well, not everybody felt that way.

148
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,870
很多人很討厭那個角色
A lot of people really hated the character,

149
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,110
因此有些人也為此而討厭我
and some of them hated me because of it.

150
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,190
我也曾接受過訪談
I would do interviews,

151
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,130
很多人都會嘲諷我
and people would be mean to me.

152
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,170
我也碰到這種事了
That just happened to me.

153
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,770
下次你想不出刷什么屏了
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

154
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,880
歡迎你寫一條艾拉·菲萊是混蛋的微博
feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,440
謝爾頓  重點的是威爾能學會接受現實
Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life

156
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,070
然后更重要的東西邁進
and moved on to bigger and better things.

157
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,220
是啊  我現在是個作家
Yeah, I'm an author now,

158
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,420
經常公開演講
I do public speaking,

159
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,230
我自己還出了一部關于桌游的網絡劇
and I have my own web series about board games.

160
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,550
我們是要哄他開心  所以...
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

161
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,400
我只是想告訴你  曾有一段時間  
I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
我以為自己走不出那角色的陰影
I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,550
但現在
But now,

164
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,310
那只是我完美人生中的一小章節
it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

165
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,850
我也很開心有過那些經歷
and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

166
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,020
我明白你的意思
I do see what you're saying.

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,350
挺受用的
That helps.

168
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,580
那就好
Good.

169
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,790
你們倆個要留下來一起玩火車嗎
Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?

170
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,670
-好  -可以啊
- Sure. - Okay.

171
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,050
太好了
Oh, great!

172
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,660
現在呢
Now...

173
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,080
我來操作控制器
I work the controls.

174
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,330
我來喊"請上車"
I say "All aboard",

175
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,800
你們倆安靜坐著看就行了
you sit quietly and watch.

176
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
我能吹哨子嗎
Can I blow the whistle?

177
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,210
你還是走吧
You should probably go.

178
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,590
你要在我家沙發上刷牙嗎
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?

179
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,880
我是要刷小桂子的牙
No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.

180
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,660
何苦呢
Why bother?

181
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,070
她有一半的時間都是在舔屁眼
She spends half the time licking her butt.

182
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,690
另一半的時間是在舔我臉
And the other half licking my face.

183
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,370
所以我才要幫她刷牙
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

184
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,530
抱歉  我回來晚了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

185
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,480
你們吃完飯了嗎
Did you already have dinner?

186
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,230
沒  我們在等你
No, we were waiting for you.

187
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,580
你們真好
Aw, that's so sweet.

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,860
所以你今晚打算煮什么呢
Yeah. So what do you feel like making?

189
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,800
霍華德  這可憐的姑娘剛忙完回家
Howard, the poor thing just got home from work.

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,770
我先給你倒杯酒
Let me get you a glass of wine.

191
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,750
然后我來做晚餐
I'll cook dinner.

192
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,150
-拉杰  你可是客人  -沒關系啦
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest. - Don't be silly.

193
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,180
快坐下  你看上去很累
Sit. You look like you've had a long day.

194
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,990
沒事啦  她經常這樣
No, she always looks like that.

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,400
因為她嫁了個傻逼
Because she married an idiot.

196
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,680
謝謝  拉杰
Thank you, Raj.

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,900
客氣啥  就當是我感謝你們
Please, this is my way of thanking you

198
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,380
讓我住在這里吧
for letting me stay here.

199
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,520
跟我們說說你今天過得怎么樣
Now, tell us all about your day.

200
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,810
好的  首先我開會遲到了
Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting

201
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,890
因為在路上堵車了
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

202
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,240
我就叫你在手機裝一個交通實時監控軟件嘛
Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.

203
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,020
你今天回家抱怨  因為吃太多糖豆
Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick

204
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,370
而肚子不舒服時
from eating too many jelly beans,

205
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,650
我有教你怎么解決問題嗎
did I tell you how to fix it?

206
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,250
沒有
No.

207
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,840
相反  我說"小可憐  一定很疼吧"
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"

208
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,140
然后幫你揉肚肚
and I rubbed your belly.

209
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
我全程都在想著你
I thought of you the whole time.

210
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,450
我的意思是  有時你只需去傾聽
All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.

211
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,280
多謝
Thank you.

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,540
有時你也得適可而止  別吃那么多糖豆
There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans.

213
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,650
"有時"是指十歲以后
And it's when you're ten.

214
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,170
塞伯特校長
Hello, President Siebert.

215
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,680
謝謝您接聽我的電話
Thank you for taking my call.

216
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,070
我只是想讓您知道  您現在可以指望我
I just wanted you to know that you can now expect

217
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,330
熱心參與有關我的發現的一切活動了
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery.

218
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,520
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

219
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,690
無需感謝我
No need to thank me.

220
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,680
要謝就謝我的朋友  威爾·惠頓
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

221
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,870
向您報告一下  我有九個朋友
For your information, I have nine friends, hmm?

222
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,700
算上您的話  就十個
Ten if we include you.

223
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,430
那就九個吧
Nine it is.

224
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,800
還是十個吧  算上沃羅威茨好了
Ah, it's ten. I'll count Wolowitz.

225
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,510
你好  朋友萊納德
Hello, friend Leonard.

226
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,870
你心情不錯嘛
Hey, you're in a good mood.

227
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,610
我心情超棒的
I'm in a great mood.

228
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,980
那你的心情即將變得更棒
Well, you're about to be in an even better one.

229
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,670
我是現在確定了才敢告訴你
I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure,

230
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,480
但
but...

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
我在我實驗室重新測試了你的元素
I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab

232
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,680
我證明了它不存在
and I disproved it.

233
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,290
你的元素根本不存在
Your element does not exist!

234
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,570
是嗎  但中國的研究小組呢
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team?

235
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,520
他們的確發現了啊
They found it.

236
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
結果證明是有人在
Yeah, it turns out someone added

237
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,200
數據文件里加入了模擬信號
simulated signals to the data files.

238
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,070
他們偽造了結果
They faked the results.

239
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,740
-真的嗎  -真的
- Really? - Yes!

240
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,590
你知道這意味著什么嗎
Do you know what that means?

241
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,830
你討厭的所有關注  通通都會消失
That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.

242
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,960
所以不會再有訪問嗎
So no more interviews?

243
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
對  全都結束了
No, it's all over.

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,100
真是難以置信
I can't believe it.

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,990
不用客氣
Well, you're welcome.

246
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,860
你奪走了我這輩子最大的成就
You robbed me of my greatest achievement!

247
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,220
什么
What?!

248
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,720
我現在只有九個朋友了
I'm back down to nine friends!

249
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,990
算了  八個吧  我也不喜歡沃羅威茨
Make it eight-- I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

250
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,660
我不明白了
I-I don't understand.

251
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,330
自從你發現這個該死的元素后
All you've done since you discovered

252
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,750
你就一直在抱怨個不停
this stupid element was complain.

253
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,200
我只是想讓你開心
I was trying to make you happy!

254
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,850
所以要奪走我唯一成名的機會嗎
By taking away my only claim to fame?

255
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,450
如果你想讓我開心
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

256
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,750
你可以跟我講個笑話
you could have told me a joke.

257
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,910
或是給我看一段有愛的視頻
Or shown me a cute video

258
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,230
比如考拉和水獺
of a koala and an otter

259
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
破天荒地成為朋友
becoming unlikely friends.

260
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,170
你總是最有理那個
Oh, there is no winning with you.

261
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,420
而且考拉和水獺居住地差了十萬八千里
And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

262
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,690
所以它們成為朋友才是破天荒之舉
That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

263
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,420
你們倆在吵什么啊
What's with all the yelling?

264
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,430
萊納德推翻了我的發現
Leonard disproved my element.

265
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,640
現在所有的關注都要消失了
Now all the attention is going to go away.

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
這很好啊  你一定很激動吧
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,390
很好  我現在只剩七個朋友了
That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

268
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,690
他是連霍比特人和超級英雄都算上了吧
He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?

269
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,550
一開始我以為元素是真實存在的  我不想要它
When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

270
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,570
但現在萊納德證實它并不存在
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

271
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,690
它反而成了我全世界最想要的東西了
I want it more than anything in the world.

272
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,510
那元素從來就不存在
The-the element never existed.

273
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,450
不是我奪走它  而是科學奪走了它
I didn't take it away, science took it away.

274
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,610
要氣就氣科學吧
Be mad at science.

275
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,620
你膽敢用科學來反駁我
Don't you dare use science against me.

276
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,880
科學可是我最好的朋友
Science is my best friend!

277
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,770
太好了  我又有八個朋友了
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

278
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,010
你能告訴他  他瘋了嗎
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

279
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,320
老實說  我理解他的意思
Actually, I get what he's saying.

280
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
太棒了  變九個了
Oh, yes! Nine!

281
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
歡迎回來  朋友
Welcome back, buddy.

282
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,320
就像跟一個你不是很喜歡的人約會
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

283
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,290
等那人跟你分手了
and then they break up with you

284
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,600
你就變得很想要那人了
and then you want them more than ever.

285
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,540
我完全不知道她在說什么
I have no idea what she's talking about.

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,120
但我們現在聯手對付你  所以我贊成她的話
but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,790
謝爾頓  那你要我怎么樣
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

288
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,230
隱瞞我的發現嗎
hide the information?

289
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,100
如果我不公布
If I don't publish it,

290
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,140
遲早其他人也會這么做的
it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

291
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,910
不  你當然得公布
No, no, of course you have to publish.

292
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,770
那是你作為一個科學家應盡的責任
That's your responsibility as a scientist.

293
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
否則會違背職業道德
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

294
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,560
你別無選擇
You have no choice.

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,580
好吧  我會公布
Fine, I'll publish.

296
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,380
你看這沒良心的混球
Can you believe this guy?

297
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,770
拉杰把碗都洗了
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

298
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,140
你怎么知道不是我洗的
How do you know I didn't do them?

299
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,750
因為有一次  所有刀子都沒洗
Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

300
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,160
你寧愿用鑰匙切面包圈  也懶得洗
you cut a bagel with your keys.

301
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,030
早上好  兩位
Good morning, everybody.

302
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,160
我出去的時候  順便買了咖啡
I picked up coffee while I was out.

303
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,200
伯納黛特  這是你的大豆薄荷摩卡
Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

304
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,540
你真是太客氣了
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

305
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,290
樂意之至
Oh, my pleasure,

306
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,340
對了  不要擔心今天的演講
and don't worry about your presentation today.

307
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,390
你一定會表現出色
You're gonna be great.

308
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,460
對啊  你一定能震驚四座
Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

309
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,830
我今天要做什么演講來著
What presentation do I have today?

310
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,890
快走吧
Just go.

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,420
他很愛你的
He loves you.

312
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,130
你這是干什么
What are you doing?

313
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,680
你是故意讓我難堪嗎
Are you trying to make me look bad?

314
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,820
我只是想當個好客人
I'm just being a good house guest.

315
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
不  你是想當一個比我還好的丈夫
No, you're being a better husband than I am.

316
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,320
洗碗  買咖啡
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

317
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
對她的生活了如指掌
knowing about her life--

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,160
誰會那樣做啊
who does that?

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
別這樣嘛  我也給你買了一杯
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

320
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,910
我不想喝咖啡
I don't want coffee.

321
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,210
所以我給你買了熱巧克力
That's why I got you hot chocolate.

322
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,690
快給我
Give me that.

323
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,020
不許什么都做得比我好
Just stop showing me up.

324
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,590
霍華德  聽我說
Howard, listen to me.

325
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
你是一個很棒的丈夫
You're a great husband.

326
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,810
沒錯  你傾聽的技巧還需要多練練
Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

327
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,090
但作為一個獨生子
But it's amazing how far you've come

328
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,850
還有一個過度保護的老媽
given that you're an only child

329
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,970
你算做得很不錯啦
raised by an over-protective mom.

330
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,660
這情形好像有點奇怪啊
Um, is this getting weird?

331
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,200
別動
Hang on.

332
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
的確是很怪
So, yes.

333
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,250
我想告訴你一聲  我發表了我的發現
I just wanted to let you know that I-I posted my findings.

334
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,790
我看見了
I saw.

335
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,780
我剛發公告  要求撤回我的論文
And I just posted a retraction of my paper.

336
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,810
現在整個科學界都知道我是錯的
Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

337
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,000
這樣的事情經常發生  謝爾頓
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,580
不是發生在我身上
Not to me.

339
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,490
我之前唯一一次公告的撤回說明
The only other retraction I ever had to issue

340
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,310
還是在我7歲的時候  我承認我哥哥
was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

341
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,220
是東德州最優秀的忍者
was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

342
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,180
但那只是把我的臉
But that was just a ploy

343
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,230
從他的臭腋窩里拯救出來的權宜之計
to get my face out of his armpit.

344
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,000
他在這里啊
There he is!

345
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,100
我最愛的超級英雄
It's my favorite superhero--

346
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
撤回俠
the Retractor!

347
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,250
拜托  別落井下石了
Come on, don't give him a hard time.

348
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,880
對不起  庫珀
I'm sorry, Cooper.

349
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
我撤回剛才說的話
I retract it.

350
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,780
順便說下  霍夫斯塔德
By the way, Hofstadter,

351
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,320
做得真棒  推翻了中國研究組的結果
nice job disproving the Chinese team.

352
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,260
不算什么
It's not a big deal.

353
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,450
這可是大事
It's a huge deal.

354
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,190
庫珀  也許你不太適合研究物理
Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

355
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,660
有沒有考慮轉去做零售
Have you ever considered a career in retail?

356
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,510
這樣你就能靠撤回東西過生活了
That way you could take things back for a living.

357
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,320
好了  巴里  太過了
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
不  沒事
Oh, no, that's okay.

359
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
我可以打贏自己的戰斗
I can fight my own battles.

360
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,320
對嗎  "八尼"  
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

361
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,610
你這是
Is...?

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,690
在嘲笑我的語言障礙嗎
Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

363
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,790
太傷人了
That's pretty hurtful.

364
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,600
我
I...

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,380
我自己沒法控制
I can't control it.

366
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,100
你說得對
You're right,

367
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,410
這招太卑鄙了
That was uncalled for.

368
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,680
我收回
I take it back.

369
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,450
你當然要收回了
Of course you do.

370
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,840
因為你是鼎鼎大名的撤回俠
Because you're the Retractor!

371
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,030
拉杰  晚餐的味道太好了
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

372
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,020
如果你多住一段時間
If you're here much longer,

373
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,490
我得買大一號的衣服了
I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

374
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,710
瞎說
Nonsense.

375
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
你需要長點肉
You need a little fattening up.

376
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,410
你最近太瘦了
You've been looking too skinny lately.

377
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,060
華仔  你怎么從來不會說這些哄人開心的話
Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

378
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
說什么呢
What are you talking about?

379
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
記得上周  我問你
Remember last week, when I asked you

380
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,850
你是否穿了塑身衣  你卻沒穿嗎
if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

381
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,400
這明明就是夸你苗條嘛
How's that different?

382
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,030
也許你可以學學你的朋友拉杰
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

383
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,500
更體貼一些
like your friend Raj.

384
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,310
也許你可以學學拉杰
Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

385
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,820
-是嗎  -當然
- Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

386
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,370
他今天早上為我打包了午餐
He packed me a lunch this morning.

387
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,120
袋子里有張字條寫著  "勇敢上吧"
And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em"

388
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,500
我為這個家做得還不夠多嗎
Like I don't do enough around here.

389
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,780
現在還要為你打包午餐嗎
Now I need to pack your lunch?

390
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,500
而且  你為什么需要字條來告訴你
And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

391
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,930
"勇敢上吧"  你是個大老爺們
to "Go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

392
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,450
你應該知道要"勇敢上吧"
You should know to "Go get 'em"!

393
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,510
我的確知道"勇敢上吧"
I do know to "Go get 'em"

394
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,310
只是有時候  我"勇敢"去"上"的同時
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

395
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,060
有精神支持感覺會更好
when I'm going and getting them!

396
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,980
別這樣  瞧你們在說些什么話
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

397
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,780
咱們冷靜下  都各退一步
Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

398
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,610
太傻了  我們為什么要吵架
This is stupid. Why are we fighting?

399
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,530
我不知道
I don't know.

400
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,850
我想是因為我覺得自己是個差勁的老公
I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.

401
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,160
你不是差勁的老公
You're not a lousy husband.

402
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
你是個非常棒的老公
You're a great husband.

403
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,170
我才覺得自己是個差勁的老婆
I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

404
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,200
開什么玩笑  你最棒了
Are you kidding? You're the best.

405
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,630
我知道問題在哪里
I know what the problem is.

406
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,130
都怪他
It's him!

407
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,170
我做了什么
Oh, what did I do?

408
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,050
你讓我們覺得  我們經營婚姻不夠用心
You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

409
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,470
我們之前很滿意我們打混摸魚的婚姻
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

410
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,130
直到你這個禍害出現
till you showed up.

411
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,970
我很抱歉讓你們生氣了
Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

412
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,600
但我得說  看到你們統一戰線
but I just have to say it's nice to see

413
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
真是太好了
the two of you on the same page.

414
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,240
你能支持我一次
Oh, it does feel good to have you

415
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,650
的確感覺不錯
backing me up for once.

416
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,500
-我總是支持你好吧  -那不是...
－ I back you up all the time! - That is not...

417
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,660
-他又在挖坑  -你這人太壞了
- He's doing it again! - What is wrong with you?!

418
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,760
真不敢相信他們把你趕出來了
I can't believe they kicked you out.

419
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,660
真不敢相信他們還沒離婚
I can't believe they're still married.

420
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,860
不好  我把小桂子的牙刷忘在霍華德家了
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

421
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,920
看來你又要和爸比共用一把牙刷啦
I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

422
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,370
要我打電話給反虐待動物協會就吠一聲
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

423
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
那只動物在咱們家干嘛
What's that animal doing in our apartment?

424
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,480
放輕松  她在籠子里  出不來的
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

425
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,430
送你幾個字送給你
I have two words for you:

426
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,040
侏羅紀公園[恐龍逃出]
Jurassic Park.

427
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,640
今天真是越來越糟糕
This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

428
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,200
如果這話能讓你感覺好點...
You know, if it makes you feel any better...

429
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,170
可能不會
It probably won't.

430
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,270
你可能是對的
You're probably right.

431
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,340
謝爾頓  今晚夜色不錯
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

432
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,940
我們出去散步好嗎
Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

433
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,700
你這人怎么整天淫蟲上腦啊
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

434
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,620
謝爾頓  你得意識到  
Sheldon, I think you might find the support

435
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,220
想在戀愛中得到多少扶持
you're looking for, if you realize that

436
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,450
全取決于自己有多少付出
relationships are a give and take.

437
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,820
你有多支持她
She can only be there for you

438
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,910
她也會有多支持你
as much as you are for her.

439
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,580
謝謝你  拉杰什
Thank you, Rajesh.

440
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,960
艾米  你對待謝爾頓也要有耐心
And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

441
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,980
而不是對他施壓  
instead of pressuring him

442
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,750
讓他接受你的這一套親密觀
to accept intimacy on your terms.

443
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,770
你還是走人吧
You should probably go.

444
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,540
我是艾拉·菲萊  這里是《科學星期五》節目
I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

445
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,190
歡迎謝爾頓·庫珀博士再次前來
I'd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

446
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,100
他以為自己發現了一種新的超重元素  
who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element

447
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,770
不料卻被另一位嘉賓萊納德·霍夫斯塔德
only to have it disproved by my next guest,

448
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,950
證明是錯的
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

449
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,600
先生們  歡迎來到《科學星期五》做客
Welcome to Science Friday, gentlemen.

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,750
-謝謝  -謝謝你
- Thanks. - Thank you.

451
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,910
艾拉  容我說一句  我想為  
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

452
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,550
我上周的行為道歉
for my behavior last week.

453
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,580
沒關系
It's all right.

454
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,340
你有沒有什么話想對我說
Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

455
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,220
沒有
No.

456
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,650
霍夫斯塔德博士
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

457
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,020
你能講述一遍你推翻
Can you walk us through the process

458
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,190
他理論的實驗過程嗎
you used to disprove his theory?

459
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,700
-好的  -我可以回答這個問題
- Well... - I believe I can answer that.

460
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,030
他問的是我
He asked me.

461
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,080
好的
Fine.

462
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,980
我剛才在說
As I was saying...

463
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,650
你講得不好  艾拉
You're telling it wrong. Ira...

464
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,660
要想好好理解這件事
to really understand the story here,

465
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,340
就得從最開始講起
you have to start at the very beginning:

466
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,200
在東德州的一個小鎮  一位年幼的天才叫做
A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

467
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,380
-謝爾頓  -沒錯  謝爾頓·庫珀
- Sheldon... - That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

468
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,380
他被鄰居家的狗咬了
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

469
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,340
這讓他有了第一次科學方面的大突破
leading to his first scientific breakthrough--

470
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,690
狗狗死亡射線
the doggie death-ray.

471
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,920
可悲的是  他不能使之成為現實
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

472
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,120
因為圣誕老人沒有送他濃縮鈾
because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

473
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
你沒意見的話  我真的很想聽
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

474
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,140
霍夫斯塔德博士說說
if it's okay with you.

475
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,700
好意外啊
What a surprise.

476
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,660
你邀請我回來  就是為了無視我嗎
Did-did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

477
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,230
事實上  我根本沒有邀請你
Actually, I didn't invite you.

478
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,630
你走進來  自己坐下  
You came in, you took a seat,

479
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,660
我不太喜歡這種唇槍舌劍
and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.

480
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,970
謝爾頓  這次采訪的重點是我
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.

481
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,610
聽起來多無趣啊
Well, that seems like a snooze.

482
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,290
在無聊的電臺上都顯得無聊
Even for public radio.

483
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,700
如果他們每說一句丟人的話
You know, if we did a shot every time

484
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,050
我們就干一杯
they said something embarrassing,

485
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,280
那這游戲絕對能把人喝到酒精中毒
this would be one hell of a drinking game.

486
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,070
現在喝酒太早了吧
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

487
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,140
我可不僅只會發表科學方面的高明見解
You know, I don't just say smart things about science.

488
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,520
我還會唱山歌
I also yodel.

489
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,560
我去拿伏特加
I'll get the vodka.
