00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,120
Wait!

6
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:32,615
Thank you.

7
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,037
-Evening.
-Good evening.

8
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,793
Do you need help?

9
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,255
Thank you.

10
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,841
My name is Alexandra.

11
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,374
Carlos. l live downstairs.

12
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:32,542
Thanks.

13
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,252
Don't mention it.

14
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:04,946
What's your problem?

15
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:16,620
Goodbye.

16
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,078
Good evening.

17
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,675
-Hello.
-Good morning.

18
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,681
-This place is very pretty.
-Thank you.

19
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:53,684
There are hardly any tailors left
in my country.

20
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,350
What is this?

21
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,470
Wool.

22
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,562
lt feels different.

23
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:15,886
lt's pure wool.

24
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:20,184
But if you're used to pret-a-porter,
you don't recognize it.

25
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,896
What's pret-a-porter?

26
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,688
Suits made in a factory.

27
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,305
You say it like that's a bad thing.

28
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,065
lt isn't?

29
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,395
They're cheaper, right?

30
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:37,233
And don't last as long.

31
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,182
A handmade suit
lasts a lifetime.

32
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,652
What's this called?

33
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,602
A pincushion.

34
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:00,976
Listen.

35
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,152
l brought some advertising,
for your customers.

36
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,566
lt's for massages.
lf you want to help me...

37
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,392
Shiatsu?

38
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,358
Thai?

39
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:22,065
They cost 60 euros.

40
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,895
But since the best advertising
is word of mouth,

41
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,864
you're invited to try one anytime.

42
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,655
Massages aren't my thing.

43
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:35,313
Lots of people say that,
but they love them after.

44
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:41,731
Excuse me.

45
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:43,106
Hello?

46
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,818
Well?

47
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,827
Will you help me?

48
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:12,281
Leave me a couple,
l'll see what l can do.

49
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,660
The truth is,
l don't know anyone here

50
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,241
and l need to make some money.

51
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:20,403
Of course.

52
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:28,573
l was serious
about that invitation.

53
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,330
Since we're neighbors,
whenever you like.

54
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,319
l'll think about it.

55
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,406
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

56
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,283
Good morning.

57
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,872
-Good morning, don Gabriel.
-Were you leaving?

58
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:14,869
l was going to run an errand,
but come in.

59
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,289
How are you?

60
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,961
Please, after you.

61
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:27,997
-How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.

62
00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:32,210
May l take your coat?

63
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:43,998
ALEXANDRA'S MASSAGES

64
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:45,329
What's this?

65
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:47,213
A neighbor of mine.

66
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,374
She just left it.

67
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,748
Are you going to try it?

68
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,877
Not the sort of thing
you try with a neighbor.

69
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:56,418
You're right.

70
00:25:56,716 --> 00:26:00,164
By the way, thanks for recommending
me to the brotherhood.

71
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:03,215
There's no need to thank me.
You're the best.

72
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,878
You can go in.

73
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,050
Yes?

74
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,432
How are you?

75
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,184
Same as always.

76
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,722
-Have you got everything?
-l think so.

77
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:14,859
Who is it?

78
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:16,152
lt's me.

79
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,488
l need your help.

80
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,610
Please...

81
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:34,908
l just had a fight in my apartment
and l want to call the police.

82
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,031
l need a witness.

83
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:39,453
You only have to say what you saw.

84
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:43,114
-l didn't see anything.
-You didn't hear anything either?

85
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,040
What was l supposed to hear?

86
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,826
Please, help me.

87
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,115
l'm sorry,
l don't want any trouble.

88
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:54,830
lt'll only take a minute.
We'll call the police and...

89
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,956
Where's your phone?

90
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:00,959
You didn't hear me?

91
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,288
l'm sorry.

92
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,041
l need to drink something.

93
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:17,417
Can you give me a glass of water?

94
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,167
A glass of water and you leave.

95
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:43,040
Make it cold, please.

96
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,623
Or if you had a beer...

97
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:51,169
Close the fridge.

98
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,715
You only have meat.

99
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:00,296
Why do you only have meat?

100
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:03,508
Close the fridge.

101
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:05,338
Thanks.

102
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,935
You drank it, now please go.

103
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,591
You think l haven't realized?

104
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:25,181
You're one of those guys
who only likes to watch.

105
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,635
Leave.
l don't want any trouble.

106
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,884
Everybody wants trouble.

107
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,641
But fine. lf you can't help me,
l'll go.

108
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:56,268
Wait!

109
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:06,893
l can go with you
to the police station.

110
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:09,269
lt's better to go in person
than to call.

111
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,609
What took you so long?

112
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,439
l was freezing.

113
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:54,866
That's the one.

114
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:03,913
Can you do it?

115
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:07,754
l think so.

116
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:14,460
You can come as often as you like,
measure it, take photos...

117
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,578
But it can't leave here.

118
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:20,211
Don Gabriel told me.

119
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:26,330
lt's a piece of great value.

120
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:30,162
Obviously it could get ruined
if we take it outside.

121
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,297
Seventy-four.

122
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,381
Eighty.

123
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:45,497
Why do they want you to do it?

124
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:47,126
Because l know how.

125
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:48,919
lt isn't right.

126
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:51,498
-Why?
-Because it's sacred.

127
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:54,333
lt's only a cloak, Aurora.

128
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,506
Your father wouldn't have done it.

129
00:37:56,718 --> 00:37:59,882
Trust me. Tell them to find
another tailor.

130
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,338
My father would have been proud.

131
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:05,712
You're wrong.

132
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:07,589
Twenty-two.

133
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,466
You might be right after all.

134
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,292
l'll have to find another job.

135
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,136
And a nice woman.

136
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:19,716
So l won't have to come
and play bingo with you.

137
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:22,299
You'll never find a woman.

138
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:24,297
Seventy-eight.

139
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:29,054
What do you know?

140
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:32,925
Forty.

141
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,351
Hello, good morning.

142
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,221
Good morning.

143
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,312
l'm sorry to bother you with this,

144
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:05,725
but l haven't heard from my sister
since yesterday.

145
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:09,887
She's your upstairs neighbor.
Her name is Alexandra and...

146
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:14,013
l was wondering if you've seen her
or spoken with her.

147
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,101
-Me?
-Yes.

148
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:17,479
Why me?

149
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,730
We had an argument two nights ago.

150
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:23,562
We had a fight in her apartment,
you may have heard us.

151
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:27,356
Alexandra walked out
and l haven't heard from her since.

152
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,606
What's that got to do with me?

153
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,894
Nothing. lt's just...

154
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:36,986
l'm asking all the neighbors
in case anyone saw her.

155
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:40,065
l don't know anything, l'm sorry.

156
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:44,144
l'm sure she'll turn up.
She's probably with a friend.

157
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:47,195
No, Alexandra doesn't know
anyone here.

158
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,354
-Sorry l can't help.
-Thank you.

159
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,022
Sorry to bother you.

160
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,732
Excuse me, one second.

161
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:07,573
Can you come here?

162
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:16,575
-Yes?
-Come in.

163
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,533
l have a friend who works
at the police station.

164
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:27,821
Afriend?

165
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,278
lf your sister doesn't turn up,
l can talk to him.

166
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,946
-Could you call him?
-Of course.

167
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,489
Now?

168
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:49,901
Hi, Antonio. lt's me, Carlos,
from the tailor's.

169
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,610
l'm here with a friend
whose sister is missing.

170
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:56,613
Please call us back
when you hear this message

171
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,864
and tell us if you can help us
or what we should do.

172
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:00,987
Thanks.

173
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:05,571
-He must be on duty.
-Thank you.

174
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,159
-l don't want to put you out.
-You're not.

175
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:11,241
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-No, l'd better go.

176
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:12,866
lt'll do you good.

177
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,615
lt was ready when you knocked,
l was making breakfast.

178
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,160
How would you like it,
with sugar, saccharine?

179
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,409
With nothing.

180
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:46,449
Thank you.

181
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:08,004
Where are you from?

182
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,576
Romania.

183
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:14,753
lt's a pretty language.

184
00:43:16,423 --> 00:43:18,792
Sometimes l heard
your sister talking...

185
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:24,165
but she often sounded angry
on the phone.

186
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:27,839
l think she was probably
talking to me.

187
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:33,006
Alexandra's kind of special.

188
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:38,004
She has a different lifestyle.

189
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:45,587
-Where did you learn Spanish?
-ln Zaragoza.

190
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:49,214
We got a job in a spa there.

191
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,836
You lived there?

192
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,209
How long have you been in Spain?

193
00:44:02,636 --> 00:44:04,592
About a year and a half.

194
00:44:06,012 --> 00:44:09,295
Are you sure she has no friends
in Granada?

195
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,132
l don't know.

196
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:36,847
As soon as he calls me back,
l'll let you know.

197
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:38,255
Thanks.

198
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:39,753
Don't mention it.

199
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:52,189
-Good evening.
-Evening.

200
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,697
-Afternoon, Dori.
-Hi, Carlos.

201
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,736
-Hi.
-Hi.

202
00:47:36,078 --> 00:47:37,157
All set.

203
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:38,989
-How much?
-80 euros.

204
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,862
-Here.
-Thanks.

205
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:50,074
-Good afternoon. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

206
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:03,035
l thought something might have
happened to her.

207
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:05,991
Want me to go with you?

208
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,576
Please.

209
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,165
-lf you need anything else...
-Thanks.

210
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:48,761
-Good morning.
-Hi.

211
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,596
Did you talk to your friend?

212
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,014
He's out of town,
l talked to his wife.

213
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,852
-He won't be back for 3 weeks.
-Oh.

214
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,134
But he'll call me
when he gets back.

215
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,343
l can't wait that long.

216
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,056
l'm sorry.

217
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,136
Would you like to come in?

218
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:11,099
-l don't want to bother you again.
-lt's no bother, really.

219
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,599
l was making breakfast.
Have you eaten?

220
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:26,396
You're not hungry?

221
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:30,972
Can l ask you something?

222
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:35,682
You said you and your sister
argued the other day.

223
00:51:36,356 --> 00:51:37,435
Why?

224
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:39,391
When...

225
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,304
Alexandra left Zaragoza,

226
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:47,271
she took some money
that wasn't hers.

227
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,430
We had saved it
so that our parents

228
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,849
could buy an apartment...

229
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:59,439
And we were supposed to send them
3 thousand euros.

230
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:02,478
But...

231
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:06,808
Alex argued with them,

232
00:52:07,902 --> 00:52:11,516
saying it was her money,
that she had earned it and...

233
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,191
she took the money and left.

234
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:20,858
l saw a man ring her doorbell
the other day.

235
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,111
What did he look like?

236
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:26,986
Strong, a little taller than me...

237
00:52:27,154 --> 00:52:30,069
and young, but some gray hair.

238
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:32,231
That's Bogdan.

239
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:33,526
What?

240
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:35,273
That's his name.

241
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,530
His name is Bogdan.

242
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:39,819
He's her friend, boyfriend?

243
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:42,062
Boyfriend.

244
00:52:44,865 --> 00:52:46,939
She might be with him,
if she doesn't want to see you.

245
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:52,694
How do you know
she doesn't want to see me?

246
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,365
Because of the money.

247
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:57,905
Maybe she's avoiding you,
waiting for you to leave.

248
00:52:58,742 --> 00:52:59,820
Yeah...

249
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:03,648
-lt's possible.
-Why don't you go back to Zaragoza?

250
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:06,700
l have your number,
l'll call you when she turns up.

251
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,694
Because l can't.

252
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:11,731
l need to find her and...

253
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:14,409
l need the money.

254
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,198
l'll have to go to the police.

255
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:25,034
What will you tell them?

256
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:25,948
The truth, that...

257
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,573
she left the apartment
and disappeared.

258
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:32,785
Want me to go with you?

259
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,526
l don't have much work
at the tailor's this morning.

260
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:39,156
-You would do that for me?
-Of course.

261
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,030
Thank you.

262
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:22,206
l shouldn't have come.

263
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,251
What did they say?

264
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,698
That since we argued
and she left by her own choice,

265
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:33,749
they're going to wait a few days
before doing anything.

266
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,584
What'll happen if your parents
don't get the money?

267
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:48,037
They'll lose the apartment.

268
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,248
l'll give it to you.

269
00:54:54,755 --> 00:54:55,787
What?

270
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:00,537
The 3 thousand euros.
l can give it to you. l'm serious.

271
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:08,080
l have no idea when
l'll be able to pay you back.

272
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:10,089
You don't have to.

273
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,122
You're just going to give me
3 thousand euros?

274
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:18,506
To help your parents,
so you can go back to Zaragoza.

275
00:55:23,508 --> 00:55:25,749
You would really do that?

276
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:27,129
Tomorrow.

277
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,252
Tell me the truth.

278
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:33,333
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

279
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:35,424
Everybody wants something.

280
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:36,797
To help you.

281
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:39,795
What do you gain by helping me?

282
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,215
Why do l have to gain something?

283
00:55:42,427 --> 00:55:44,668
Otherwise you wouldn't do it.

284
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,126
You think that's how people work?

285
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:51,799
That's how the world works.

286
00:55:56,763 --> 00:55:57,925
Not me.

287
00:57:01,812 --> 00:57:03,353
Please, let me talk.

288
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:07,556
The next customer l see come in here
l'll call the police, period.

289
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:09,726
-What's the problem?
-Hi, Carlos.

290
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:11,932
Nothing, l was explaining

291
00:57:12,146 --> 00:57:17,099
to the young lady that she should do
her thing somewhere else, not here.

292
00:57:17,313 --> 00:57:18,937
You're making a mistake.

293
00:57:20,147 --> 00:57:21,095
Excuse me?

294
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:25,266
You've got the wrong person.
That's her sister, she's visiting.

295
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:28,647
l was only saying
that we won't stand for...

296
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:30,433
You already said that.

297
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:49,389
l'm sorry.

298
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:52,643
lt's not your fault.

299
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:57,230
-Would you like to come in?
-No, thanks. l'm in a hurry.

300
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:01,267
l brought you the money.

301
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:05,725
Carlos...

302
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,442
l don't want you to feel obligated.

303
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,479
l don't feel obligated.

304
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:22,896
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

305
00:59:01,659 --> 00:59:03,615
This thread doesn't exist anymore.

306
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:06,398
We can fold it.

307
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:12,575
We'll see if we can find needles.

308
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,696
Hi.

309
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:47,945
Hi.

310
00:59:50,748 --> 00:59:52,953
My parents got the money.

311
00:59:53,582 --> 00:59:57,743
And... l want to invite you
to dinner to thank you.

312
00:59:59,624 --> 01:00:01,202
lt's my sister's.

313
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,697
Thank you, but l don't think
that's necessary.

314
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:06,865
Why?

315
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,157
Because you don't owe me
anything.

316
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:13,624
What if l want to thank you?

317
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:16,664
l'd rather not, thank you.

318
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:22,167
Why are you saying this?

319
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:28,119
You do me a huge favor and
won't even let me buy you dinner?

320
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:31,791
l don't feel like going
to a restaurant, that's all.

321
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,119
Then we can do something else.

322
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:39,128
Please, don't insist.

323
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:47,082
Why did you give me the money,
Carlos?

324
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:50,084
l already told you,
to help you.

325
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:53,668
So you can go back to Zaragoza.

326
01:00:55,464 --> 01:00:58,083
Alexandra is behind all this,
isn't she?

327
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,755
She wants to get rid of me
and she's using you.

328
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:06,630
Do you know where she is?

329
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:08,630
Have you spoken to her?

330
01:01:10,175 --> 01:01:12,082
Nina, that's nonsense.

331
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:24,461
There's something
l don't understand.

332
01:01:25,592 --> 01:01:26,755
What's that?

333
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:33,417
My sister is capable
of just about anything, but...

334
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,886
l don't know,
this time it's different.

335
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:40,634
l can feel it here.

336
01:01:42,052 --> 01:01:44,721
l bet she's with her boyfriend
waiting for you to leave,

337
01:01:44,928 --> 01:01:46,588
laughing at all this.

338
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,838
You could be right.

339
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:58,966
But l don't want to keep
talking about her.

340
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,129
Have you got any brothers
or sisters?

341
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,219
No.

342
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:10,387
And your parents?

343
01:02:11,057 --> 01:02:12,171
They died.

344
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:16,006
And you have no other family?

345
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:17,130
No.

346
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:21,968
And a girlfriend?

347
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,677
A girlfriend?

348
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,012
Yeah.

349
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,464
Never had one.

350
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:31,971
Never?

351
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:35,053
l've seen women,
but never a real girlfriend.

352
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,763
Why not?

353
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:39,349
l like living alone.

354
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:44,392
You like being alone.

355
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:46,143
l'm used to it.

356
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:50,975
How does somebody
get used to being alone?

357
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:54,350
l read a lot,
l listen to the radio...

358
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:56,721
l really like my job.

359
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:05,350
But... what about at night?

360
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:08,231
When you get in bed...

361
01:03:09,647 --> 01:03:13,428
you don't think about what it would
be like to have someone with you?

362
01:03:13,648 --> 01:03:18,056
Nina, not wanting to learn to be alone
is pure fear.

363
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,267
That's not true.

364
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:50,770
Carlos... do you like girls?

365
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:52,527
l like girls.

366
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:58,029
Nina, l'm not trying to sleep
with you. lf you think that's why...

367
01:03:58,195 --> 01:03:59,817
No, l don't think that.

368
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:05,683
Everything you're doing for me
is very important.

369
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,936
And l don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

370
01:04:12,321 --> 01:04:14,359
lt's not only about the money.

371
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:20,112
l want to do something for you
as well.

372
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:24,898
Would you let me?

373
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,353
Of course.

374
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:46,029
Here's a towel,
in case you're cold,

375
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:48,025
to cover yourself with.

376
01:04:50,326 --> 01:04:51,439
And...

377
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:55,815
take off your clothes
and lie down.

378
01:05:02,036 --> 01:05:03,991
l'll be back in a minute.

379
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,330
What's wrong?

380
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:22,372
Carlos?

381
01:12:45,257 --> 01:12:46,205
Hi.

382
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,964
l wanted to see you.

383
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,252
Come in.

384
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,539
What's wrong?

385
01:13:06,302 --> 01:13:08,624
l went to the police station.

386
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,211
And...

387
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:14,504
they found a dead girl

388
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,124
the same age as my sister.

389
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:18,417
And...

390
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:23,130
they want me to identify her.

391
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:29,882
Would you mind coming with me?

392
01:13:48,264 --> 01:13:49,721
You'll see only her face.

393
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:53,095
lf you'd like to see something else,
a tattoo or birthmark, tell me.

394
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:58,006
Take your time. The body was
in the water for more than 48 hours.

395
01:13:58,224 --> 01:14:00,096
Tell me when you're ready.

396
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:02,474
Whenever you want.

397
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,603
That's not my sister.

398
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,638
lt's not Alexandra.

399
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,722
Okay, thank you.

400
01:15:10,815 --> 01:15:11,894
Thanks.

401
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:14,554
See you tomorrow.

402
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:20,354
Carlos...

403
01:15:24,943 --> 01:15:29,103
The other night in the apartment...

404
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:31,433
l'm sorry l left like that.

405
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,145
What happened?

406
01:15:37,236 --> 01:15:38,349
l don't know.

407
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:42,016
ls there something wrong with me?

408
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:43,149
No.

409
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:52,775
You say you've never had
a serious girlfriend...

410
01:15:55,488 --> 01:15:57,893
but l don't think that's true.

411
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,484
You don't?

412
01:16:02,155 --> 01:16:03,353
l'm sure of it.

413
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,110
And whoever it was,
she really hurt you.

414
01:16:16,783 --> 01:16:18,026
See you tomorrow.

415
01:16:39,202 --> 01:16:42,366
''Take this and eat it

416
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:46,029
for it is my body

417
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,981
given for you.''

418
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:05,368
ln the same way,

419
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:10,948
after supper he took the cup,
and giving thanks once again,

420
01:17:11,288 --> 01:17:13,991
he passed it to his disciples
and said:

421
01:17:14,206 --> 01:17:17,239
''Take this and drink it

422
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:20,076
for it is my blood,

423
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:23,537
the new testament

424
01:17:23,874 --> 01:17:26,707
to be spilt for you

425
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:28,906
and for all men

426
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:31,530
in forgiveness of all sin.

427
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:36,248
Do this in remembrance of me.''

428
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:53,075
l'm leaving town for a few days.

429
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:55,577
Why are you telling me?

430
01:17:56,252 --> 01:17:58,539
Why do you think?
So you know.

431
01:17:59,086 --> 01:18:00,662
Other times you disappear

432
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:03,747
-without telling me.
-l'm telling you now.

433
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:08,294
ls something wrong?

434
01:18:09,544 --> 01:18:10,494
No.

435
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:13,992
Are you sure?

436
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:19,247
Why did you say the other day
l could never be with a woman?

437
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:20,920
Because it's true.

438
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,578
People change.

439
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,752
People are what they are.

440
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:28,334
l'm glad you're not my mother.

441
01:19:26,263 --> 01:19:27,175
Nina?

442
01:19:31,931 --> 01:19:32,879
Nina?

443
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,509
What happened?

444
01:19:51,015 --> 01:19:52,261
Are you okay?

445
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,057
lt was Bogdan.

446
01:20:09,477 --> 01:20:13,518
He found out l sent my parents
the 3 thousand euros.

447
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,804
He says l killed my sister
to keep the money.

448
01:20:21,019 --> 01:20:23,390
He tried to make me confess.

449
01:20:26,312 --> 01:20:28,219
He went into a frenzy

450
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,594
when he saw l was living here now.

451
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:43,264
And he wants to go to the police.

452
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:46,513
But l didn't do anything.

453
01:20:49,398 --> 01:20:52,182
l swear to you
l didn't do anything.

454
01:23:41,836 --> 01:23:42,948
How are you?

455
01:23:47,211 --> 01:23:49,083
Did you sleep here?

456
01:23:50,128 --> 01:23:51,371
On the sofa.

457
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,827
Thanks for staying.

458
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:01,960
Nina, l was thinking...

459
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:07,833
Bogdan might come back.

460
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,956
You should stay at my place
until things calm down.

461
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,457
You'll be safer.

462
01:24:29,092 --> 01:24:30,169
Here.

463
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:34,083
The number at the tailor's
in case you want to call me.

464
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,299
You can sleep in the bedroom,
l'll take the sofa.

465
01:24:37,508 --> 01:24:39,878
l left you some towels on the bed
to shower.

466
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:42,129
l turned on the hot water.

467
01:24:43,176 --> 01:24:45,048
Don't open the door for anyone.

468
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,132
You promise?

469
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,000
Yes.

470
01:27:33,404 --> 01:27:34,353
Hi.

471
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:35,519
Hi.

472
01:27:35,738 --> 01:27:38,984
l made dinner.
l wanted to cook for you.

473
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:53,279
l bought some food,
you didn't have any.

474
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:55,655
l made pasta.

475
01:28:04,991 --> 01:28:06,532
You don't like it?

476
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,397
lt's great.

477
01:28:11,367 --> 01:28:13,690
You don't like it.
l can tell.

478
01:28:13,992 --> 01:28:15,983
No, really, it's not that.

479
01:28:20,869 --> 01:28:22,111
Then what is it?

480
01:28:23,326 --> 01:28:24,702
l'm tired.

481
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:39,159
Do you like Alexandra?

482
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:45,112
What are you talking about?

483
01:28:46,163 --> 01:28:49,327
You had one of her flyers
in your studio.

484
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,033
Advertising massages.

485
01:28:52,788 --> 01:28:55,537
Then l saw it disappeared.

486
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:58,034
l suppose you took it down.

487
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:02,946
Your sister put them
all over the neighborhood.

488
01:29:04,999 --> 01:29:06,905
Why did you keep it?

489
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:10,825
l forgot to throw it away.
What does that matter now?

490
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,075
lf it doesn't matter,
why did you take it down?

491
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,536
Because you didn't want me
to see it?

492
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:21,492
l didn't think it would do you
any good.

493
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:28,331
l couldn't take it happening again.

494
01:29:29,918 --> 01:29:32,785
My sister's always taken
everything from me.

495
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:36,955
She won't take anything from you.

496
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:42,335
-l'd rather you told me the truth.
-That is the truth.

497
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:44,915
Your sister won't take anything
from you.

498
01:29:50,212 --> 01:29:53,127
Nina, l have a cabin
in the mountains.

499
01:29:54,754 --> 01:29:56,958
lt's a place l go sometimes.

500
01:29:57,963 --> 01:29:59,504
There isn't much to do there.

501
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:03,248
Go for walks, sleep...

502
01:30:07,214 --> 01:30:10,379
But l disconnect
and forget about my problems.

503
01:30:13,424 --> 01:30:15,130
Would you like to go?

504
01:30:18,007 --> 01:30:19,416
lf you want.

505
01:30:21,507 --> 01:30:23,913
We can leave early tomorrow morning.

506
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:29,250
lt's a nice place
to see the sunrise.

507
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:40,236
Echo!

508
01:34:14,827 --> 01:34:15,941
Thanks.

509
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:35,369
lt's like a dream.

510
01:38:29,773 --> 01:38:30,853
Carlos?

511
01:38:34,524 --> 01:38:36,432
What are you doing over there?

512
01:38:37,233 --> 01:38:38,347
Nothing.

513
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,105
Come here with me.

514
01:42:24,218 --> 01:42:25,379
Thanks.

515
01:43:26,516 --> 01:43:28,757
l killed Alexandra.

516
01:43:35,144 --> 01:43:37,015
l killed your sister.

517
01:43:40,143 --> 01:43:41,554
l killed her.

518
01:44:48,527 --> 01:44:50,980
Last night l tried to kill you.

519
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:03,558
You could never do that.

520
01:45:12,237 --> 01:45:14,608
Your sister's not the first woman.

521
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:17,779
l've done it before.

522
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:23,736
You've done what?

523
01:45:24,824 --> 01:45:25,901
Kill.

524
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,321
l kill them...

525
01:45:33,075 --> 01:45:34,981
and l eat them.

526
01:45:53,494 --> 01:45:56,325
Why are you telling me this now?

527
01:45:58,578 --> 01:46:00,484
Because it's the truth.

528
01:46:06,787 --> 01:46:08,527
Nina, we have to go.

529
01:46:09,621 --> 01:46:12,820
We should get in the car
and drive back to Granada.

530
01:46:14,746 --> 01:46:16,203
The police are looking for you.

531
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,740
lf you don't turn up,
they'll think you're guilty.

532
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,450
lf all this is true...

533
01:46:29,956 --> 01:46:32,362
why didn't you kill me
last night?

534
01:46:35,872 --> 01:46:36,986
l couldn't.

535
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,163
You couldn't?

536
01:46:54,792 --> 01:46:57,162
Why don't you kill me now?

537
01:46:58,626 --> 01:47:00,083
lt would be easy.

538
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,209
We're in the middle
of the mountain,

539
01:47:03,419 --> 01:47:05,041
l can't run away.

540
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:09,455
Nobody will find out
and it will all be over with.

541
01:47:09,626 --> 01:47:11,832
-Please stop.
-l don't want to.

542
01:47:12,044 --> 01:47:15,410
Everything you're saying,
all this nonsense

543
01:47:15,586 --> 01:47:18,454
about dead women
and my sister...

544
01:47:19,462 --> 01:47:21,085
lt's all a lie.

545
01:47:24,504 --> 01:47:26,875
Why don't you tell me the truth?

546
01:47:31,464 --> 01:47:33,667
l desired your sister.

547
01:47:34,588 --> 01:47:36,496
From the moment l saw her.

548
01:47:36,714 --> 01:47:38,289
With all my heart.

549
01:47:39,382 --> 01:47:41,252
That's why l killed her.

550
01:47:41,464 --> 01:47:43,371
Like the other women.

551
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:48,289
With you l couldn't.

552
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,537
l can't.

553
01:49:34,602 --> 01:49:35,514
Nina...

554
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:39,260
Nina...

555
01:49:41,437 --> 01:49:42,385
Nina...

556
01:50:04,189 --> 01:50:05,434
Nina, my love!
