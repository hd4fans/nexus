NARRATOR: The war between sorcerers

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,390
was fought in the shadows of history

3
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:02,854
and the fate of mankind rested with the just and powerful Merlin.

4
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,025
He taught his secrets to three trusted apprentices,

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,488
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,324
He should have trusted only two.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,543
Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,628
of a sorcerer beyond evil,

9
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,096
Morgana le Fay, Merlin's most deadly enemy.

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,282
We are but servants.

11
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,911
- Merlin. - Horvath!

12
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,955
You betray me?

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
(GASPS)

14
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,710
I am no one's servant.

15
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,548
Well done. Now get the spell.

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,553
NARRATOR: And so it was. Morgana gained sorcery's most dangerous spell

17
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,097
known as "The Rising,"

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,309
giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the dead

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,685
and enslave mankind.

20
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,454
Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar

21
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,791
by drawing Morgana's soul into her own body.

22
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,294
But Morgana began to kill her from the inside.

23
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:56,050
To save Veronica's life and to capture Morgana,

24
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,512
Balthazar trapped them both in the Grimhold,

25
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,681
an inescapable prison.

26
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,853
Over time, Balthazar fought many sorcerers

27
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,521
who tried to free Morgana,

28
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,649
trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll.

29
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,903
Eventually, he captured Horvath as well.

30
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,742
As Merlin lay dying, he gave Balthazar his dragon ring,

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,287
saying it would guide him to the child

32
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,415
who would one day grow to be Merlin's successor,

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,292
the Prime Merlinean.

34
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,919
The Prime Merlinean is the only one

35
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,214
who can kill Morgana.

36
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,509
NARRATOR: Balthazar would search for centuries.

37
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,112
And never, it is said, will Balthazar waver from his quest,

38
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,073
for mankind will never be safe

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,370
until Morgana is destroyed by the Prime Merlinean.

40
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,544
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)

DAVE'S MOM: David? Field trip today.

43
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,804
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.

44

You're not supposed to be doing that, Dave.

47
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,921

That's cool.

...which means that before Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty were built...

51

DAVE: (WHISPERING) Pass it to Becky.

52

MS. ALGAR: Let's go.

55
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,058
Get on the ferry. Get your bags. Stay close. Here we go.

56
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,112
Hey, stop!

57
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,797
Excuse me, excuse me.

58
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,549
No!

59
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,426
No, lady, don't!

The second emperor of the Han dynasty

locked his least-favorite wife in this urn for 10 years to the day.

64

They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you.

65
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,273
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.

66
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,234
Have you seen it? It kind of just blew into your store.

67
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,153
A note?

68
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,779
It blew into your store.

69
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,781
(STAMMERING) It was just a...

70

Coincidence.

71
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,243
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

72
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,543
I have something I'd like to show you, Dave.

73
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,421
- How'd you know my name was Dave? - 'Cause I can read minds!

74
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,592
It's on your backpack.

75
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,138
Come over here.

76
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,571
This is very special

77
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,616
and if it likes you, you can keep it.

78
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,204
I better not. My teacher said I couldn't be gone for long.

That ring on your finger means something, Dave.

It means

88
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,515
you're going to be a very important sorcerer one day.

89

00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,397
And I need soldiers.

498
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,690
I got one kid.

499
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,985
He ain't old school.

500
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,820
One will do.

501
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,157
Your ingenuity and your heart

502
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,285
will give you an advantage over Morganians.

503
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,246
They rely only on the power of their magic.

504
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,418
But if you're up against the wall, there's only one weapon of choice,

505
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,211
the plasma bolt.

506
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,471
Nothing. There's nothing.

507
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,434
I got it! I got one! I got one!

508
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,104
That's underwhelming.

509
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,857
God.

510
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,443
Again.

511
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,028
Ow! Ow! Ow!

512
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,536
(READING)... and invite my soul...

513
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,746
And again.

514
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,000
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!

515
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,053
DRAKE: So, out of a bath full of jewels, I'm going to emerge, right?

516
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,721
And everyone's going to think I'm me.

517
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,433
I reach into the big top hat and I pull myself out,

518
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,310
but I'm a woman.

519
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,023
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.

520
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,276
If I could get, like, a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

521
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,238
But not out of its mouth, that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.

522
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,117
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.

523
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,287
Yeah. Yeah, now, keep it straight up sinister.

524
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,332
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

525
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,710
Sorry, are you lost?

526
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,839
So, you're what passes for a Morganian these days.

527
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,803
Maxim Horvath! You are one smoking man of...

528
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,471
Will you excuse us, ladies?

529
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,556
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

530
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,978
Bob.

531
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,063
Sorry.

532
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,026
So, they tell me you're some kind of entertainer.

533
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,281
Five sold-out shows at the Garden, plus back end on the pay-per-view.

534
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,244
Did you ever see Morgana pull a rabbit out of a hat?

535
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,831
Look, my master disappeared when I was 15, vanished!

536
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,582
Left me with nothing but an Encantus

537
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,294
and some prescription-grade abandonment issues.

538
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,170
So I improvised.

539
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,756
Well, the time for improvisation is over.

540
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,220
Balthazar Blake may have found the Prime Merlinean.

541
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,596
He wears the ring?

542
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Mmm.

543
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,437
The best way to defend against fire,

544
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,024
vacuum sphere.

545
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:14,985
Your turn.

546
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,990
(GASPING)

547
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,575
I did it! I did it!

548
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,036
Excellent. Excellent.

549
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,496
- Excellent. - I just did that.

550
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
What's wrong with your Tesla coil? It seems to be firing on its own.

551
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,925
Really, really funny.

552
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,719
- This will be hilarious, then. - (CRACKLING)

553
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,179
Oh, my God!

554
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,477
Dude!

555
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,272
Beg your pardon. I haven't eaten in 10 years.

556
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,608
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

557
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,152
You mind if I ask what's so special about this bench?

558
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,658
- No, no, no. - What?

559
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,577
There's no time for that, and too much at stake.

560
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,412
That girl,

561
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,248
she's the one, man.

562
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,210
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

563
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,172
Aren't you supposed to help me to achieve my personal goals?

564
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,550
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.

565
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,344
I'm your master.

566
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,472
And your master says if Horvath catches you out on the street,

567
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,932
you'll die.

568
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,059
Is she worth that?

569
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,269
Think about it, Dave.

570
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,319
And don't eat my sandwich.

571
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,989
Becky! What a coincidence.

572
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,783
BECKY: Oh, hey, Dave.

573
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,536
- Going uptown or... - Are you stalking me?

574
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,121
Not in a threatening way.

575
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,415
Why was I even concerned?

576
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,501
So I listened to your show last night.

577
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,711
- What did you think? - It was amazing.

578
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,547
I've never actually heard of any of those bands,

579
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,966
which I think is a good indicator that they're cool.

580
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,426
(BECKY LAUGHING)

581
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,761
I'm glad someone was listening.

582
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,889
This may come as a surprise to you, I don't get up to much.

583
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,892
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.

584
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,144
- Give me the bracelet. - Okay, okay.

585
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,728
- Give me. - DAVE: Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,105
(BECKY SCREAMING)

587
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,692
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

588
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,447
No! Dave, don't!

589
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,169
You just give me that bracelet back, please.

590
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,171
You better run back to your girlfriend.

591
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,424
Believe me, I wish she was...

592
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,217
You thought she was my girlfriend?

593
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,512
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?

594
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,723
You talk too much. Shut up.

595
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,436
What are you doing?

596
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,272
I have no idea what you're referring to. I honestly...

597
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,067
Whoa!

598
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,903
- You seeing this? - Heads up.

599
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,242
COP: Up the stairs!

600
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,412
- Are you okay? - Yeah. Here you go.

601
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,456
Your grandmother's bracelet.

602
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,667
How did you do that? That guy was huge.

603
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,713
I've been doing a lot of cardio boxing lately.

604
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,425
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

605
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,264
Something about you seems different.

606
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,226
I'm wearing new shoes.

607
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,980
- Nice. - Thank you. This your train?

608
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,275
Yes. Thank you.

609
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,694
I just want to tell you that

610
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,030
if you want me to help you with your midterms,

611
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,323
come by my lab.

612
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
- I'll text you the address. - Yes, yes, that would be great.

613
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,953
- Yeah? - Tomorrow?

614
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,204
It's a date.

615
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,793
No, no, no. It's not a date! It's a date like an appointment.

616
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,046
No. A date like an appointment!

617
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,391
Love is a distraction.

618
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,811
Sorcery requires complete focus.

619
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,898
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning. There's more to learn.

620
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,321
This is perfect.

621
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,032
The Rising will happen here.

622
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,911
We'll use their satellite dishes on the rooftops.

623

Here we go. All right. Move.

626
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,015
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me.

627
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,435
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.

628
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,022
And before that, we need to find the boy.

629
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,481
Well, how do we do that?

630
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,194
We'll wait until he's alone.

631
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:15,577
Now, focus on control. Set me down slow and steady.

00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,045
I'll be back shortly.

- Hi. - Hi.

00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,141
We should go. A library, anyplace...

642
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,729
Is that company I hear?

643
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:47,901
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Becky, this is my...

644
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,278
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.

645

Hey, Dave, I'm confused.

646
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,532
I thought you and I were staying in together.

647
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,201
If this is a bad time,

648
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,911
- I can come back. - Yes, actually.

649
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,079
No. No.

650
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,582
Uncle, you and I have plans for later on.

Becky, let's just get out of here.

652

You know what? It's all right, because I just remembered

653
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,340
I have to go into town to pick up your anti-itch cream.

654
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,385
So, you two stay here. Pleasure to meet you.

655
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,397
DAVE: Okay, enough with the studying. There's something I want to show you.

656
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,983
- What are these things? - Tesla coils.

657
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:14,070
I was using them to generate something called plasma.

658
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:19,743

She was making preparations for The Rising,

until we found the sorcerer who would inherit his power.

777

And his dragon ring.

778

- Dave, don't. - Please just let me do it.

987
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,766
- What? - '73 Pinto? This is your idea?

988
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,561
No! No. My idea was to turn their car into a beater.

Hey!

I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

997
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,710
Where's Horvath?

998
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,586
Did he get away?

999
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,256
Where's the Grimhold? Who was that?

1000
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,176
That was her, wasn't it?

1001
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,679
The third apprentice.

1002
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,894
For centuries, Veronica, Horvath and I were the only thing standing

1003
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,564
between Morgana and man's destruction.

1004
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,235
Our friendship and our magic were what Veronica and I depended on.

1005
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,488
You fell for her, didn't you?

1006
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,576
I fell for her.

1007
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,498
Like you, all Veronica wanted was to be normal.

1008
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,502
Normal things, normal life.

1009
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:57,922
I fell.

1010
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,260
And so did Horvath.

1011
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:06,848
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

1012
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,184
For 1,000 years,

1013
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,561
you've been carrying her around with you.

1014
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,563
In the Grimhold.

1015
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,776
I was going to give this to her that night.

1016
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,744
I'm sorry.

1017
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,457
Okay, Balthazar.

1018
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:37,170
We are going to get Veronica out and destroy Morgana.

1019
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,715
What's happened to you?

1020
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,217
Nothing.

1021
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,968
You're still a bad liar.

1022
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,014
- Why does everyone... - You know, I am glad she likes you.

1023
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:51,142
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.

1024
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,521
There's nothing like it, is there?

1025
01:18:56,774 --> 01:19:00,527
Put your old man shoes back on.

1026
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,612
We have some work to do.

I chipped my mani, which is not cool.

No, I imagine it's not.

1031
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:19,170
Inside there lies our next coworker.

1032
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:23,550
Abigail Williams, a little witch who put Salem on the map.

1033
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,803
Once she's out, we're at the Morgana shell.

1034
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,557
Now that's going to take a lot of time and energy to crack.

1035
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,100
So what are we going to do?

1036

Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct.

You know, what feels right.

1041
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:48,867
Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell is a rather nasty piece of business.

1042
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,745
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.

1043
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,375
It enables one sorcerer to steal the energy from another.

BALTHAZAR: All right.

When Morgana is released, no matter what happens,

promise me you'll do whatever it takes to destroy her.

And for the record, you wear the old guy shoes very well.
