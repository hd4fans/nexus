1
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, that's it! Spindle, taillight..

2
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,718
Hey. Hey!

3
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,376
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

4
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,852
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,721
Yeah, this is the sleeping chamber.
Go to sleep.

6
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,691
Don't make me come up there!

7
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,596
I'm so sorry, but I must have
the final ingredient for my potion.

8
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,463
Now, what's more important:

9
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:22,575
Me completing my life's work
for the salvation of the colony...

10
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,539
Which includes you guys.

11
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,838
- Or your sleep?

12
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,607
- Sleep. I'm going with sleep.
- Yeah, the second one.

13
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,980
Well, then I shall try to be very quiet.

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,916
Clacktiel.

15
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,951
That's it, I'm coming up there!

16
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,223
Fire crystals.

17
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,590
At last. The final ingredient.

18
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,270
I'm on vacation.

19
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,839
- No. No, cut it out.
- Dogpile.

20
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,914
Dogpile.

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,719
It's the Destroyer!

22
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,324
Atomic wedgy.

23
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,696
And a clean break.

24
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,095
- Clean break. Excellent wedge.
- Yeah. All right.

25
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,895
Come on, man,
I'm running out of underwear.

26
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,402
Well, what are you gonna do about it, huh?
Nothing.

27
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:31,408
- Because I'm big and you're small.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:36,675
- Because he's big and you're small.
- Hey.

29
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,546
Quit repeating everything I say.

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,744
I was just adding emphasis, dude.

31
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,685
Man, why you gotta be hating?

32
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,867
Destroyer.

33
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,216
Zoc?

34
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,886
Water!

35
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,119
- Zoc.
- Hova, please, get to the grass.

36
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,695
It's dangerous up here.

37
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,355
But I've always wanted to see
a human up close.

38
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,866
I hear they're capable of speech, like us.

39
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,698
They are nothing like us.

40
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,446
What you gonna do about it, ants?
Nothing.

41
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,175
Because I'm big and you're small.

42
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:50,288
Away, monster, or I will use my powers
to destroy you.

43
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,084
Powers that I have yet to perfect. Run!

44
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,600
Hello.

45
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,140
We mean you no harm.

46
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,641
- Oh, great.
- Shoe!

47
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,540
Shoe!

48
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,185
- Please, go in peace.
- Look out!

49
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,792
- Are you all right?
- L... I guess he didn't hear me.

50
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,730
Lucas.

51
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,199
Peanut, it's time to come inside now.

52
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,235
Peanut.

53
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,414
I think I might have gotten through
to him.

54
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,313
- What do you think?
- Destroyer.

55
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,789
Tiffany, Lucas, we're leaving now.

56
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,686
Lucas? All the numbers are on the fridge.

57
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,421
- Good one. Extended play.
- Lucas.

58
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,928
What are you doing back there?
Why didn't you answer?

59
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,528
- Are you all right, sweetie?
- I'm fine.

60
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,105
- I was just playing with my friends.
- I don't know.

61
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,904
- Maybe we shouldn't go on vacation.
- Come on, it's our big wedding anniversary.

62
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,841
We're going to Puerco Vallarta.

63
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:25,747
And I gotta spend a little quality time
with the mamacita.

64
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,920
Don't cancel your vacation
just because of me.

65
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:33,081
- I can solve my own problems.
- Problems? What problems?

66
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,251
Does it have anything to do with
why I can't find your underwear?

67
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,657
No!

68
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,799
Bed-wetting is nothing
to be ashamed of, Peanut.

69
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,867
What? Just stop it, Mom!

70
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,096
I don't have any problems
except for you treating me like a baby.

71
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,698
- Peanut.
- And stop calling me that.

72
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,504
Just go away and leave me alone.

73
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,846
I, Zoc, call upon the elements:

74
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,820
The wind that blows, rain that falls,
fire that burns.

75
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,189
Deliver your awesome power
and transform my potion.

76
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,091
Clacktiel.

77
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,693
That was great, sweetie.

78
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,361
I loved the smoke effects.
Didrt you, Spindle?

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,271
You...

80
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,307
...rock. Curse upon your children.

81
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,105
I don't think rocks have children, honey.

82
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,614
- They won't now.
- Okay. What's the matter?

83
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,082
Hova, the potion is supposed to
change color.

84
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,711
It's not changing color.
It's not changing color.

85
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,188
I call upon the elements:
Wind, rain, et cetera.

86
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,885
Transform my potion and clacktiel.

87
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,198
Clacktiel, clacktiel...

88
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,497
- Maybe you're pronouncing it wrong.
- How could I pronounce it wrong?

89
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,869
- I made it up.
- Take a break.

90
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,669
Hova, perhaps you didn't notice...

91
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,837
...but we were almost squished today,
and the colony is in shambles.

92
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:06,110
I am this close to finding a solution
to the human problem...

93
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,845
...and you tell me I need to...
Hova, what are you doing?

94
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,012
- Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
- No. Wait.

95
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,055
- No.
- I'm simply walking towards you.

96
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,456
- There's no reason to panic.
- Wait. Now, Hova...

97
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,096
- I'm just coming towards you.
- Wait. No. Hova. No.

98
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,528
Does it tickle?
What about when I do this?

99
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,634
Why are you laughing?
I see you laughing.

100
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,861
Don't make me clacktiel you.

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:29,235
Well, I'm glad you two have something
to laugh about.

102
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,871
- Head of Council.
- Hi.

103
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,412
How nice of you to...
It was unexpected.

104
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,210
Forgive me.
I was working on an experiment.

105
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,580
Oh, yes, I see.

106
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,315
Well, we were... How may I be of service?

107
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,722
Zoc, attacks from the Destroyer
grow more frequent.

108
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,659
Our food supplies
are now desperately low.

109
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:56,495
The council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution.

110
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,132
Fight back. We must stop the Destroyer.

111
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,604
But thousands of ants
would needlessly die.

112
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,506
Perhaps if we could communicate,
you know, just talk with the human.

113
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,240
Oh, what a great idea.
Let's have a nice chat.

114
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,715
Well, hello, Destroyer.
Gee, you look kind of tired.

115
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,377
Why don't you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend.

116
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,784
Okay, oka...

117
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,425
Sometimes you're a real stinkbug,
you know that?

118
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:25,758
Zoc, a war with the human is...
It's impossible.

119
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:30,392
A wizard knows no such word.

120
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,175
- Whatever.
- Bye, Tiff. Bye, Lucas.

121
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,744
I love you.

122
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,709
You kids mind your grandma.

123
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,148
Okay, goodbye. Have fun.

124
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,517
Don't worry, everything's under control.

125
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,752
A little help, please.

126
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,524
I think it's your turn.

127
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,668
Teeth in the grass.

128
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:08,063
Mommo, here's your...
What are you doing?

129
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:12,337
Preventing alien abduction,
that's what I'm doing.

130
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,503
Thank you.

131
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,413
Dang crabgrass.

132
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:23,021
See these? Airflow. Aliens hate airflow.

133
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,386
Drives them nuts. And if they try to cut
the power in the middle of the night...

134
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,090
...these babies will wake me up.

135
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:37,430
- We gotta be prepared. Tell your friends.
- I don't have any friends.

136
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,071
Well, who's gonna look out for you
when you get old...

137
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,232
...and your teeth are falling out,
and them aliens are after you?

138
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,039
- Lucas.
- I'll look after myself.

139
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,609
- Good night, Mommo.
- Good night. Sleep tight.

140
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,810
Don't let the bedbugs bite...

141
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,184
...or creep into your ear
and lay eggs in your brain.

142
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,533
- Dance, Pukas.
- Dance, monkey boy, dance!

143
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,872
Think fast.

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,495
Clacktiel.

145
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,534
You...

146
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,369
Zoc, please, not in front of Spindle.

147
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,335
Sorry.

148
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,077
God, there must be something I missed.

149
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,409
Wait. A crack.

150
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,680
That's it. Imperfections in the crystals.

151
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,757
Perhaps coating it
in a viscous compound.

152
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,894
Spindle. Resin.

153
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,631
Clacktiel.

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,642
Oh, that's it. It worked!
The potion is complete!

155
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,914
Praise the Mother! Yes! Yes! Yes!

156
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,519
No!

157
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,448
- Zoc.
- Hova, hang on.

158
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,420
Spindle, get the potion. Quickly.

159
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,553
Hello.

160
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,334
Yep, I was about your age
when I flooded my first colony.

161
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,106
Brother, those were good times.
Good times!

162
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,506
- Who are you?
- Stan Beals is the name.

163
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,373
Beals-A-Bug Pest Control.

164
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,644
Exterminator, eradicator,
solver of problems.

165
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,514
Hey, you must be the Nickle boy, right?

166
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,712
Now, your dad ordered my services...

167
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,517
...but he forgot to sign the contract
before he left.

168
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,661
Busy man. Lot on his mind. It happens.

169
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,889
So he just told me to talk to you...

170
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,033
- Lucas.
- Yeah, Lucas.

171
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,968
He said, "You have my son, Lucas,
sign the contract for me...

172
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,166
...if I happen to forget to before I leave.
He's a grown man now."

173
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,334
His exact words.

174
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,381
I don't know.
Do you have any references?

175
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,984
References?

176
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,915
There's one.

177
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,087
I don't think I should.

178
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,290
You don't think you should, huh?
You don't think?

179
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,990
So who does your thinking for you?
Your mommy?

180
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,635
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
what do I do?

181
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,670
I'm just a little baby
that can't think for myself.

182
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,602
Please wipe my little bottom for me.

183
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,871
Wipe me. Oh, oh, please, wipe me.

184
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:45,074
- Give me that stupid contract.
- Yes, sir. A very mature decision.

185
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,685
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

186
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,880
Just sign right here
And leave the killing to me

187
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,991
I wrote that.

188
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,032
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

189
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,236
Spindle? Spindle?

190
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,583
Spindle. You saved it.

191
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,912
Oh, well, come here.

192
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,078
Well, someone's getting
an extra moldy root tonight.

193
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,383
- Okay, okay.
- Zoc.

194
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,495
Spindle, light.

195
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,667
- Mother, help us.
- Oh, no.

196
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,572
To attack without provocation,
without reason...

197
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,942
...just because they can, it's...
It's barbaric.

198
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,115
But what can we do?

199
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,816
We are lost.

200
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,347
No. We are saved.

201
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,653
This is our salvation.

202
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,955
A potion?

203
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,692
What exactly does it do?

204
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,957
Hey. Hey, hey.

205
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,747
Human. Come with us.

206
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,753
Shoo. Shoo. Get away. Get away.

207
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,054
I got a fan. I'm windy.

208
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,725
I am windy.

209
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,569
Hello?

210
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,603
Hello?

211
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,409
Hello?

212
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,174
Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

213
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,942
Stop! Hey, come on! Cut it out!

214
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,647
What are you doing out of bed,
tiny Lucas?

215
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,200
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

216
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,023
Gross. Hey, cut it out.

217
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,084
Put me down! Hey. Stop. Put me down.

218
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,387
Put me down!

219
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,027
What is that? Oh, he smells.

220
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,569
- It's the human.
- It's Peanut, the Destroyer.

221
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,774
Oh, my.

222
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,037
- All right, Peanut, this way.
- It's small.

223
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,578
- What is it?
- Touch it.

224
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,736
- Don't touch it.
- Hey.

225
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,884
- Poke it.
- He's so soft.

226
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,455
- His skeleton is on the inside.
- He's inside out?

227
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,027
Where are you taking me? Help!

228
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,927
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

229
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,969
Human...

230
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,711
...you have been brought
before the council...

231
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,679
...to face judgment
for crimes against the colony.

232
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,111
Read the charges.

233
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,216
"This human-destructor beast...

234
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,720
...hereafter referred to
as Peanut the Destroyer...

235
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,587
...did willfully
and with malice aforethought...

236
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,422
...crush the food-storage chambers...

237
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,996
...flood all of the lower
hatching chambers...

238
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:12,763
...and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain."

239
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,963
Hey, come on, I had to go.

240
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,607
Sentencing of the human
will be handed down...

241
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,440
...by the queen herself.

242
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,256
Greetings, my children...

243
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:39,796
...and to our unusual guest...

244
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:45,232
...a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony.

245
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,373
Wait a second! Wait, wait, wait.
Time out.

246
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,772
How was I supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials?

247
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,711
- You're just a bunch of stupid ants.
- Destroy the Destroyer!

248
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,442
- Throw him in the pit.
- Let's eat him!

249
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,349
No, wait. We are not mindless savages.

250
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,649
This human should be studied.

251
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,416
- And then we'll eat him.
- Yeah.

252
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:10,619
Eat! Eat! Eat!

253
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,623
Order. Order.

254
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,193
Be still, be still.

255
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,997
Tonight we have a choice.

256
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:25,542
We could destroy this human
and make safe this day.

257
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:30,512
Or we could change
the nature of this human...

258
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:36,348
...and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants.

259
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:41,618
I therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony...

260
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,890
...to learn our ways.
He must become an ant.

261
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,034
- What?
- No. No, my queen.

262
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,600
What if he does not become an ant?

263
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,072
Okay, I mean, come on.

264
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,105
That would be regrettable.

265
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,074
But... But who will teach him our ways?

266
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,709
- I will.
- Hova?

267
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,354
It is done.

268
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,582
Let us continue our work.

269
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,351
That's it?
How long am I gonna be like this?

270
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,791
I wanna go home.

271
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,727
Wait. This is inuman.

272
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,361
Yes, it is.

273
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,433
Hello, Peanut?

274
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,267
Destroyer?

275
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,044
Hello? We have to go.

276
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,115
It's time to start your training.

277
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,951
Where are you?

278
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,583
Okay, okay. It's simple.

279
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,818
All I have to do is run past the guards,
then escape the anthill...

280
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,987
...and not get eaten by anything.
- Well, hello there.

281
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,497
You know, there's a million things
I wanna ask you.

282
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,659
When were you hatched?
Are you...? Are you male or female?

283
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,796
And how do you tell the difference?

284
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,805
Is it...? Oh, is that how?

285
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:08,275
Hey, stop peeking.
Or... Or I'll stomp on you.

286
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,213
Well, I wouldn't if I were you.
You see, I'm the only friend you've got.

287
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,510
You're gonna eat me.

288
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,150
You know, now that you mention it,
you do look soft and chewy...

289
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,790
...but I promised the queen I wouldn't.

290
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,454
Cross your heart.

291
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,254
What? Oh, all right.

292
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,420
Cross my heart, I will not eat you.

293
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,360
I said, cross your heart, not your butt.

294
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,331
I just did.

295
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,733
See, there, did it again.

296
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,133
Strange custom.

297
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,007
I'm still not going.

298
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,110
- Peanut, you need to...
- My name's Lucas, not Peanut.

299
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,007
Lucas.

300
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,206
Well, Lucas. You heard the queen.

301
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,080
You must become an ant
if you ever want to return home.

302
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,187
And how am I supposed to do that?

303
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,880
Well, you just have
to find your place in the colony.

304
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,896
So, Lucas,
do you have any special skills?

305
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,540
I can make milk come out
of my sister's nose.

306
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,508
Okay, well, let's try foraging.

307
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,669
The instructor
is a personal friend of mine.

308
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,974
I'm sure she'd love to help.

309
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,345
Peanut? The Destroyer?

310
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,646
I had to move out
of my nest because of you.

311
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,413
I lost everything.

312
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,853
Took me all morning to rebuild.

313
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,689
Hova, don't tell me
that you are mentoring this... This... This...

314
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,993
It's Lucas.

315
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,335
Why is he covered in trash? Is he crazy?
Because I don't teach crazy ants.

316
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,031
No, no, no. He calls the trash "clothes."

317
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,233
They like keeping
their gender traits hidden.

318
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,102
He's male.

319
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,015
Okay, Lucas, you're on the blue team.

320
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,845
- Oh, man. That's not fair.
- Come on.

321
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,044
Hey, hey, hey, quiet.

322
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,849
And suck in that thorax.

323
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:03,358
Like everything in the colony,
foraging is a team effort.

324
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:09,558
In this test, each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles...

325
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,465
...retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest.

326
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,698
No ant gets left behind.

327
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,467
First team back wins.

328
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,611
Any questions?

329
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,277
- Hello, baby.
- Fugax.

330
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,445
Well, isn't it true that scout ants,
such as myself...

331
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:36,083
...lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue.

332
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:40,053
- Fugax!
- While foragers, such as you...

333
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:43,429
...just walk around and pick up sticks.

334
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,065
Questions, anyone?

335
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,400
- Oh, sir?
- The guy with the crooked mandibles.

336
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,098
What kind of adventures?

337
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,642
Well, I'm glad you asked.

338
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,213
- Fugax.
- Gather round, young scouts.

339
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:02,911
In my travels, I have journeyed
far beyond the great flat rock.

340
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,980
You mean, the street?

341
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,289
No. The great flat rock...

342
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:14,489
...where the humans
ride in their giant metal cocoons.

343
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,162
Cars.

344
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,299
Did I call on you?

345
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,734
Who invited Captain Party Pooper?

346
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,771
Fugax, meet the Destroyer.

347
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,340
Destroyer?

348
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,608
Now, are there any other...?

349
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,154
Are there any other questions
about your assignment?

350
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,192
Yeah, what's a sweet rock?

351
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,885
Go.

352
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,103
- Bridge.
- Stack up.

353
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,704
Bridge, hooyah.

354
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,101
Come on, Peanut.

355
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,402
Hello, I can do it myself.

356
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,649
Hey, guys. I think he's dead.

357
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,185
I'm not dead.

358
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,987
- Ladder.
- Ladder, hooyah.

359
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,721
- Come on.
- Grab hold.

360
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,860
I don't need your help.

361
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,086
I need your help! I need your help!

362
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,458
Bye, losers.

363
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,795
Come on.

364
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,135
- All right.
- Hurry, human.

365
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,500
You're gonna make us lose.

366
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,938
Hey. I've only got two legs.

367
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,238
Go, Two Legs, go.

368
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,710
Go, Lucas.

369
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,179
- Spring.
- Spring, hooyah.

370
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,285
Hooyah.

371
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,745
Oh, time out.

372
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,857
I don't think I can do this...

373
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,185
All right.

374
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,522
- Let me off!
- Don't let go!

375
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,593
I'm gonna be sick.

376
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,394
Don't let go.

377
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,730
- I'm letting go.
- Don't let go.

378
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:03,963
He let go.

379
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,011
- A jellybean?
- All right, Lucas.

380
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,913
Good thinking.

381
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,484
Slingshot, hooyah.

382
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,392
- All right, Lucas. Good job.
- Yeah, Peanut, you rule.

383
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,660
- Come on, we're losing. Let's go.
- Good job, Lucas.

384
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,428
- Did we win yet?
- Almost.

385
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,540
We just have to get the sweet rock
over the finish line.

386
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,902
Come on, let's go.

387
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,609
Hurry up, Peanut.

388
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,744
Yeah, right.

389
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,816
Hurry, Lucas, climb the wall.

390
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,247
Climb fast, Peanut.

391
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,648
They're catching up.

392
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,682
Bye-bye, loser.

393
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,414
Climb the wall.

394
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,423
Come on. Climb the wall.

395
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,221
Come on.

396
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,160
Forget it. This game is rigged.

397
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,324
- Ladder.
- Hooyah.

398
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,460
Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go.

399
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,607
We got it. We go it. Yeah, man. All right.

400
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,207
Red rules.

401
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,012
Red team wins.

402
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,246
All right. We did it.

403
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,949
Thanks for trying.

404
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,724
Lucas, you did fine, really.

405
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,335
You just need to discover the ant within.

406
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,870
Start by visualizing yourself with six legs.

407
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,133
- Then, if you...
- How's that gonna get me home?

408
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,800
Look at me. I'm not a stupid ant.

409
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,812
Lucas, being an ant means more
than just having six legs or...

410
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,349
Or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall...

411
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,046
...it's being part of a colony.
Not always thinking of yourself first.

412
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,521
- Oh, careful.
- Hey, don't touch me.

413
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,751
I'm trying to help you.

414
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,292
You think this is easy for me?

415
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,692
Being the Destroyer's little helper?

416
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,733
So you worry about you,
and I'll worry about me.

417
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,797
Oh, Lucas.

418
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,598
That's not the way ants are.

419
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:18,004
Oh, Hova, that's the way I am.

420
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,940
Well, if I could just...

421
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,908
Just what?

422
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,510
Hello? Earth to ant lady.

423
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,017
You were in the middle
of sounding like my mom.

424
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,888
They're coming. Run!

425
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,926
Hey. Hey! What's wrong?

426
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,695
- They're after the herd.
- What herd?

427
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,561
Whoa, easy, girl.

428
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,469
Easy.

429
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,606
Take cover.

430
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,240
Tell the queen I love her.

431
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,375
Oh, we're cut off.

432
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,526
Come, brothers, for queen and colony.

433
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,268
Get to the grass.

434
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,136
Attack formation.

435
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,303
Load them up.

436
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,837
- Enemy fire.
- Watch your wing. Watch your wing.

437
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,141
- Now, that's gotta sting.
- Nice shot.

438
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,184
My turn.

439
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,451
- Thanks.
- Where's Hova?

440
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,351
I don't know.

441
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,115
Come on.

442
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,120
To your positions. Ready.

443
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,622
Squirt.

444
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,171
Don't.
Please, I was just following orders.

445
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:01,806
Who wants magic?

446
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,675
Clacktiel.

447
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,219
You look tasty.

448
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,787
Leave him alone.

449
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,956
Hova? Oh, quick, get out of my way.

450
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,288
Move.

451
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,829
- Hova.
- Hurry.

452
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,398
Everyone, into the grass.

453
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,959
Don't just stand there. Help her.

454
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,767
Lucas, run.

455
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,133
What are you doing?

456
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,168
Everyone, into the grass.

457
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,838
Where are you...

458
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,906
...little bug?

459
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,728
Please, hurry up. Light, light.

460
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,564
Light, light.

461
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,238
Hova, get down.

462
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,942
Zoc.

463
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,184
No!

464
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,115
Stop, hey! No, no.

465
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,501
Fire in the hole!

466
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,742
- What was that?
- It's bath time.

467
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,008
Retreat.

468
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,156
They're leaving.

469
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,628
We... We won.

470
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,593
All hail the Destroyer.

471
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,205
Peanut! Peanut!

472
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,806
Brilliant. Genius.

473
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,465
I mean, Lucas made a:

474
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,111
And then... they all flew away.

475
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,543
And now I know
why they call you Peanut.

476
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:54,048
He's got a brain the size of a peanut.

477
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,879
Lucas the Destroyer.

478
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,949
I take back everything
I thought about you.

479
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,647
You saved us.

480
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,118
Thank you, Lucas.

481
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,024
Yeah, sure.

482
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,130
He saved us.

483
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,168
Oh, it's so obvious, I was so dumb.

484
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,862
Praise the Destroyer.

485
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,372
Wake up. He saved himself.

486
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,570
The rest of us just...

487
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,676
Just got in the way.

488
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,309
Zoc. Oh, are you all right?

489
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,951
- No, I'm...
- What happened to you?

490
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,643
I'm fine. I'm fine.

491
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,085
- You're hurt.
- No, it's nothing, really, I just...

492
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,087
Zoc, do you have any yucca sap?

493
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,489
Lucas has a burn. Poor baby.

494
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,262
This is our enemy.

495
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,193
They do not save ants, they kill ants.

496
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,837
He very nearly killed me.

497
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,001
Or does that not matter to you?

498
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,043
I do, you do
We all like the honeydew

499
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,712
Dinner is served.

500
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,357
And I'm the dessert.

501
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,119
And I'm on a low-fathead diet.

502
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,626
And you know, it looks good on you.

503
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,526
So, Lucas, what are you working on?

504
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,688
Glasses.

505
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,035
This is some good honeydew.

506
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,443
Oh, Lucas, you have to try some.
It's so good.

507
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,372
Go ahead.

508
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,149
This is awesome.

509
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,811
Tastes like green-apple bubble gum.

510
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,830
That went away quick.
Another round for you?

511
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,466
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

512
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,676
Get it while it's hot.

513
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,752
Whoa, I didn't know
humans could change their colors.

514
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,789
- Trippy.
- Perhaps our young pupa...

515
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,393
...ate too much honeydew.

516
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,093
Here, eat this.

517
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,633
It'll make you feel better.

518
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,132
What did that come out of?

519
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,071
It's an alka root.

520
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,269
Zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well-being.

521
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,507
He is a great wizard.

522
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,708
Yeah, he hates me.

523
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,409
Whoa, he really does, doesn't he?

524
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,282
I mean, he hates your guts.

525
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,151
It's actually amazing
how much he hates your guts.

526
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,587
Okay, I'm sorry.

527
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,593
Yes, Zoc has anger issues,
especially towards humans...

528
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,230
...but he's a true ant.

529
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,658
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

530
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,560
Just give him time, Lucas.

531
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,323
Praise the Mother.

532
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,550
Praise the Mother.

533
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,554
Thanks.

534
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,256
Who is this mother
you keep talking about, anyway?

535
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,491
Is it the queen?

536
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,932
No, Lucas, the Ant Mother.

537
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,929
The queen of queens.

538
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,904
She gave birth to the first colony.

539
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,805
To all ants.

540
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,414
Come on. It's time for you to see.

541
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,966
This is the Chamber of the Ages.

542
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,772
What are these?

543
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,667
They tell the story
of our colony, our history.

544
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,141
These are pretty cool.

545
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,891
This is the image of the Ant Mother.

546
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,924
It is said that one day she will return...

547
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,968
...and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain.

548
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,504
Then we will never go hungry again.

549
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,336
So you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky?

550
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,173
Yes. That would be a blessed day.

551
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,481
I'm sorry, it's just so beautiful.

552
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,580
Hey, what's that one?

553
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,449
It's the evil one.

554
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,090
The Cloudbreather.

555
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,553
It is ancient, drawn before our time.

556
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:10,133
No one knows for sure what it is,
except that death is said to follow it.

557
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,532
I think it's just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving.

558
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,535
No, the exterminator.

559
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,005
L... I gotta cancel him.

560
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,609
I gotta go home now.

561
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,143
But you're not an ant yet.

562
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,537
- Just a quick visit.
- No way, Two Legs.

563
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,706
The humans' nest is strictly forbidden.

564
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,218
Well...

565
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,113
...the colony needs food, right?

566
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,813
Food?

567
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,789
Yeah, sweet rocks.
My house is filled with them.

568
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,419
- In assorted colors and flavors.
- Assorted flavors?

569
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,860
Even the greenies?

570
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,557
Well, you'll be needing a scout.

571
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,635
No. There is no way
you're gonna get me...

572
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,295
- I'm in.
- Come on.

573
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,672
Better be some red ones.

574
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,443
Wow, this is a big nest.

575
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,380
Must have taken thousands
of humans to build this.

576
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,747
- What's that?
- It's just the door.

577
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,412
A door? Fantastic.

578
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,054
Do all of your guests
pass under this door?

579
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:13,060
Well, actually, you guys
are the first friends I've had over.

580
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,959
We are the first ones?

581
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,862
Kreela, we're the first ones
to pass under the door.

582
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,162
- Great.
- And to think...

583
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,773
...all of this is made from your own poop.

584
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,234
Nice.

585
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,945
Oh, why did Mom
have to get shag carpet?

586
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,844
Lt'll take days to get to the kitchen.

587
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,509
Oh, gee, that is too bad.

588
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,487
I guess now we'll have to go home
before we all get in trouble.

589
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,255
No.

590
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,124
Wait.

591
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,597
Come on.

592
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,601
This is called hang-gliding.

593
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,108
Have you ever done this, actually?

594
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,504
I played the video game.

595
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,203
Now, when I give the word,
everybody jump.

596
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,942
Now.

597
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,284
Oh, sorry, was that the word?

598
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,619
- Coming.
- Hey, hey, look out.

599
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,820
For queen and colony.

600
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,056
Oh, God.

601
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:31,703
- Showoff.
- Awesome. Yeah.

602
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,905
This is Hawaii.
We went there last summer.

603
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,413
It's got volcanoes and hula dancers
and Don Ho and surfboards.

604
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,175
And I caught a fish.

605
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,249
And these are the pyramids.
Well, not the real pyramids.

606
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,255
The real ones are lots bigger.
Mommo says aliens built them.

607
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,756
She's my grandma.

608
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,267
Oh, are these your nest mates?

609
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,140
Yeah, that's my family.

610
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,434
Which one's the queen?

611
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,305
My sister thinks she is.

612
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,643
What's wrong?

613
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,977
Nothing. It's just, well...

614
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,345
I should have told
my mom goodbye. That's all.

615
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,856
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

616
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,151
- Lucas, your face is leaking.
- Leaking?

617
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,196
Oh, no, it's okay.

618
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,629
Is that what humans do
when they're sad?

619
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,291
They leak from the face?

620
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,431
When ants are sad, we do this:

621
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,218
Oh, Lucas, it's... It's...

622
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,387
It's beautiful!

623
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,394
Sweet rocks, come to papa!

624
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,209
Red one.

625
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,016
What are you doing?
Why aren't you taking the red ones?

626
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,354
Well, it's actually
quite simple, sugar lips.

627
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,926
I hate the red ones.

628
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,189
Well, I love the red ones.

629
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,855
- Hate them.
- I love them!

630
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,728
- Hate, hate, hate.
- Love. Love.

631
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,734
- Admit it, you find me attractive.
- What?

632
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,634
Oh, how you tease me
with your sweet talk.

633
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,071
Oh, you want some sweet talk?

634
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,507
Because I'll give you some sweet talk.

635
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,113
Now grab a red one
before I pull these off.

636
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,873
Whoa, I need those.

637
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,310
What are we doing?

638
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,318
Nothing, nothing.

639
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,273
- Mommo, I'm back!
- What was that?

640
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,409
- Tiffany.
- What's a Tiffany?

641
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,980
- Hurry up!
- Right.

642
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,811
Leave the red ones behind!

643
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,748
Fugax!

644
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,987
Hey, pipsqueak, you there?

645
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,921
Hello?

646
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,856
Crossfire!

647
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:42,187
That kid and his stupid electronic toys.

648
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,794
What is he doing?

649
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,269
Jumping. You know,
hippity hop, uppity downy?

650
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,432
It's a scout thing.
You wouldn't understand.

651
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,744
Okay, come on. One more.

652
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:55,936
I just need a seven.

653
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,145
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.

654
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,254
Pizza Kingdom. Hail to the king.

655
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:09,222
Would you like to try our new
Princess Pepperoni with tangy Jester Sauce?

656
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,754
Hello! This is Lucas Nickle!

657
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,056
I need to cancel my order!

658
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,991
What?

659
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,499
You don't want to order?

660
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,966
Please cancel the contract!

661
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:28,908
- No exterminator!
- No extra tomato. Got it.

662
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,943
Yes. No exterminator.

663
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:35,085
I'm canceling the contract.

664
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,187
What? You... You wanna cancel?

665
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,344
Who is this?

666
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,388
Oh, Bill, is this you, man?

667
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,755
You got me, man. You got me, dude.

668
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,858
That's a relief.

669
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,558
Okay, Lucas, I don't understand
most of what just happened.

670
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,202
What is an exterminator?

671
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,272
Oh, don't worry. Everything's okay now.

672
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,342
Hide!

673
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,486
This is Tiff. Hi, Mom.

674
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,887
Yeah, everything's fine.
Lucas is being a pest.

675
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,891
He's in his room playing...

676
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,791
...those stupid video games.
- No, no!

677
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,899
I will. I will. Okay, Mom.

678
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:29,397
Yes. I'm hugging the phone too. Bye.

679
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,079
You must be Queen Tiffany.

680
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,805
Allow me to introduce...

681
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,157
Remember your training.

682
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,591
Oh, no. No, no, no! Mother!

683
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,339
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

684
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:05,133
Hello?

685
00:49:06,142 --> 00:49:08,610
Tiffany, no! You'll squish Lucas.

686
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:11,076
Hello. Nobody's shrunk.
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

687
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:12,509
What are you talking about?

688
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:15,412
Lucas! You let him go. It's me you want.

689
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:21,353
Come back. Probe me instead. Lucas!

690
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,220
Bring back Lucas, you alien scum!

691
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,388
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

692
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,965
- Okay, Mommo.
- Lucas.

693
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,331
Let's go find your other teeth.

694
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,425
Hova, where are you?

695
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:11,665
Hova? Hova! Are you all right?

696
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,574
Are we all right? Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

697
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:17,645
We're fine. We're all right. Silly.

698
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:20,449
Whoa, whoa, wait.
No, wait, now, hold up.

699
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,778
Zoc! Zoc, guess what we did?

700
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,045
We went to Hawaii.
We saw the pyramids.

701
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:26,620
We flew without wings.

702
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,381
At first, it was like:

703
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,082
But then it was:

704
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,593
Of course, the others were terrified,
so I took charge. And then we...

705
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:36,197
We were inside the humans' nest.

706
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,392
Humans' nest? That's forbidden!

707
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,661
Right, right.

708
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,670
But the nest was filled
with sweet rocks, okay.

709
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,330
Lots of them.

710
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:49,604
But then Queen Tiffany started swatting,
some massive flying teeth attacked us...

711
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:52,543
...and, well, here we are.
What a day. Good night.

712
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:56,173
And who told you
about these sweet rocks?

713
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:59,583
- Lucas, of course.
- Really?

714
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:04,226
Hi, there. How are you?

715
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,595
- Okay.
- Okay. That's good.

716
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,562
It's good to be okay.

717
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:15,432
Listen, I just wanted
to show you something, if that's okay.

718
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,497
You know what this is?

719
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:22,608
This is the potion that will
make you big again.

720
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:26,814
I just wanted you to take
a good, long look at it.

721
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:30,047
Because this is the last time
you will ever see it.

722
00:51:31,287 --> 00:51:32,720
What do you mean?

723
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:37,155
I mean, there is no way I am ever
going to make you big again.

724
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:43,865
Ever. You are a threat
to every ant in this colony.

725
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:45,967
Especially to Hova.

726
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,569
But I would never do anything
to hurt Hova.

727
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,798
I just... l...

728
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,966
I just wanna go home.

729
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,735
Well, then, if I were you...

730
00:51:55,912 --> 00:52:01,214
...l'd try to find help somewhere else,
because there is nothing for you here.

731
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,918
Nothing.

732
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,824
The pain, the pain! It's unbearable.

733
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,492
Just put me out of my misery!

734
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,365
Oh, hold still, you big pupa.

735
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:24,870
I haven't even touched you yet.

736
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,976
Be gentle with me.

737
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,688
- Where's Lucas?
- Isn't he with you?

738
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:45,121
- No.
- Lucas? Lucas? That's weird.

739
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,886
Well, he's probably off destroying
some other poor, unfortunate colony.

740
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,056
You know how they are. Destroyers.

741
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,133
Zoc, what have you done?

742
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:56,465
- Me? What did I do?
- Where is he?

743
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,072
He's gone.

744
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,335
- He led you into a trap, Hova.
- There was no trap.

745
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,708
He led us to food.
He was trying to protect us from...

746
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,315
- From what? What, Hova?
- From something.

747
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:08,950
Oh, something!

748
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:11,177
And I was worried it was from nothing.

749
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,981
He's blinded you, Hova.

750
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,420
No, you are the one who's blind.

751
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:18,822
You are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans...

752
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:22,226
...you see only what you want to see.
- Oh, come on.

753
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,366
Zoc, I see a young pupa,
a human learning our ways...

754
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,233
...becoming part of this colony,
becoming an ant.

755
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,838
- Impossible.
- Listen to yourself, Zoc.

756
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,604
"A wizard knows no such word."
So, what are you now?

757
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:39,347
Certainly not the ant I love.

758
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,240
Hova!

759
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:44,113
I did it for you, for the colony.

760
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,448
You did it for yourself.

761
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:48,785
Hova, I...

762
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:52,858
He won't make it
through the night alone.

763
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,054
Fugax, your leg's broken.

764
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,563
Yeah, but I still have five good ones.

765
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,668
Very good ones.

766
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,363
You know, I believe he was trying
to protect us from something.

767
00:54:03,606 --> 00:54:05,597
See you, Zoc.

768
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,256
Maybe Zoc is right.

769
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,434
Now I'll never get home.

770
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:38,571
Hi! Nice evening, huh?

771
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:39,765
Oh, may I?

772
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:41,769
Sure, help yourself.

773
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:45,903
Thanks, I love water! I'm a beetle
that loves water, but I'm not a water beetle.

774
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,744
Isn't that funny? I'm a beetle...

775
00:55:26,055 --> 00:55:27,545
Hey, Lucas.

776
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,083
Hey, anybody know what... means?

777
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,195
I think I just figured it out.

778
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,291
Croaker!

779
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,134
This way!

780
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,806
Don't ever leave me again.

781
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,312
- But Zoc told me...
- You are my pupa, not Zoc's.

782
00:55:56,919 --> 00:55:58,409
Lucas, come on.

783
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,989
Climb! You can do it. Just concentrate.

784
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:10,894
I'm an ant. Okay, I'm an ant.

785
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:14,127
- He's got it. He's got it.
- Look, I'm an ant!

786
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:17,170
He hasn't got it.

787
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,905
Grab hold!

788
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,514
Hova?

789
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:34,556
Lucas!

790
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:51,803
Wow, we came right
down that guy's throat, didn't we?

791
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,669
Hey, smiley, you're on my wing.

792
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,811
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

793
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:57,445
So, what do you guys do?

794
00:56:57,613 --> 00:57:00,639
I'm a glowworm. I glow.

795
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:02,010
That's great!

796
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:04,675
You're really starting
to irritate me. Can you...?

797
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,860
Oh, gross.

798
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:14,858
Will you quit eating, fatso?

799
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,999
It's cramped in here.
There's no more room!

800
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:21,899
Don't worry. I'm afraid we will be
moving along in due course.

801
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,698
Always with the negative with you.

802
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:27,240
Why can't you be more... Hey, Lenny!

803
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,076
This is what I'm talking about.

804
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:32,544
Lenny always has a smile on his face...

805
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,082
Let me out! Let me out!

806
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,279
- I don't wanna be a toadstool!
- "A toadstool." That's great.

807
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,048
- You like that?
- That's very funny.

808
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:44,317
There's plenty more
where that came from, pal.

809
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:46,358
I like... Hi, what's your name?

810
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,622
There he goes again.

811
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,992
Stop! Come back!

812
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,567
- Hova!
- No!

813
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,261
Hova, he's gone.

814
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,670
Croaker, over here. This way!

815
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:01,036
- Zoc!
- Zoc!

816
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,371
I am delicious, eat me.

817
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,673
Zoc, are you crazy?

818
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:08,476
- He's crazy.
- Hey, froggy!

819
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:13,454
No relationship is won'th this.

820
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:22,156
Oh, sure. Why not? Come on in.

821
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:25,664
- Welcome to paradise.
- Zoc! How'd you get here?

822
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,065
I sure didn't come in
through the rear entrance.

823
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:30,865
Welcome. Make yourself at home. Hi.

824
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,530
Who is this? Your ant?

825
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:35,472
Zoc, you are crazy.
You're inside a frog, for Mother's sake.

826
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,475
What are you doing? This is impossible!

827
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:40,376
"Listen to yourself, Zoc.
A wizard knows no such word.

828
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,813
So, what are you now?"

829
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,219
Weirdo.

830
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,752
What does she see in you?

831
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:51,825
- What does she see in you?
- Exactly!

832
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,390
Not me.

833
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,066
- Hey, is that...?
- Alka root? So it is.

834
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,401
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my.

835
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,745
You might wanna let go of that.

836
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:13,780
Oh, no. So you can grab it?
I don't think so.

837
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:16,918
- Hands in the air.
- Oh, my.

838
00:59:21,957 --> 00:59:23,754
Wow, that was great!

839
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:26,724
Hey, we sure owe you one!
Thanks a lot!

840
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,428
I'm free! I'm free!

841
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,225
Oh, crap.

842
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,338
Hey, Zoc, thanks. But why'd you do it?

843
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:43,945
An ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends.

844
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,378
- I thought you hated me.
- I didn't do it for you.

845
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:04,963
All right, well, we should
camp here for the night.

846
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,694
Come on, Fugax. Let's forage some food.

847
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,805
Excuse me? I don't forage.

848
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:13,373
I'll scout for food.

849
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,009
Right, let's go.

850
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,244
Zoc, stay with Lucas.

851
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,971
He's been through a lot today.

852
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,049
- Hova, please, don't ask me to...
- He's not what you think.

853
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,049
There is goodness in him.

854
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,950
There's an ant in him.

855
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,220
See, he really is trying.

856
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:32,087
Come on. You can do it.

857
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,525
- Concentrate.
- One, two, three.

858
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:40,930
Think ant. Ant. Ant.

859
01:00:42,104 --> 01:00:44,334
Yeah, all right.

860
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,840
Craznocks.

861
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,416
It's funny.

862
01:00:58,587 --> 01:01:01,886
The sky looks exactly the same.

863
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:04,457
Everything else is so different...

864
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,858
...but it's the same sky, the same stars.

865
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,163
Why must you keep doing that?

866
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:16,794
- Are you ill?
- What? Oh, you mean yawning.

867
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:20,305
- I'm just tired.
- Please stop. It's disgusting.

868
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:25,604
- Ants don't yawn?
- Definitely not, thank you.

869
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:32,017
So this city of yours, it's like a nest?

870
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,918
Well, yeah. Kind of.

871
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,786
And the humans that live there
are all brothers...

872
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,929
...working together
for the greatness of their colony?

873
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,390
Well, not exactly.

874
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:48,435
It's a little more like,
you know, every man for himself.

875
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:51,035
But that's so primitive.

876
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,765
How does anything get done?

877
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,873
Some people work together.

878
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,944
Some. Why not all?

879
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:00,609
I suppose it's because
of their differences.

880
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,377
But it's the differences
that make a colony strong.

881
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:07,215
Foragers, scouts, drones,
nurses, regurgitators...

882
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:10,654
...all are different,
but an essential part of the whole.

883
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:13,294
This is where we ants draw our strength.

884
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,723
My differences just get me beat up.

885
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,561
- And why is that?
- I don't know.

886
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,596
Some humans prefer to clobber people
they don't understand.

887
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:27,503
Like you prefer to clobber ants.

888
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,507
I guess I didn't think
about what I was doing.

889
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,114
Seems to happen a lot.

890
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:40,879
I suppose sometimes I, too,
can act without thinking.

891
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,957
Perhaps in this way, we are alike.

892
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,230
Good night, Lucas.

893
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,062
Good night, Zoc.

894
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,477
- What's the matter?
- Look!

895
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:38,704
- What is it? What's wrong?
- I see her!

896
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,678
- Who her?
- The Ant Mother!

897
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:43,113
She's come! She's here!

898
01:03:45,654 --> 01:03:48,179
Look! Look!

899
01:03:52,928 --> 01:03:54,486
What do you know?

900
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,061
There really is an...

901
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:01,366
No.

902
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:13,009
Cloudbreather.

903
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,776
But I cancelled the contract.

904
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:18,915
Praise the Mother!

905
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,919
- Praise the Mother!
- She's come at last!

906
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,648
Everyone, please, calm down.

907
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,432
Listen to me! It is not the Ant Mother!

908
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:35,900
- It is a Cloudbreather!
- It's true.

909
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,905
He's come to wipe out the entire colony.

910
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:40,933
How can we possibly fight back?

911
01:04:41,343 --> 01:04:42,833
His magic is strong.

912
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,871
Sprayers.

913
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,045
Foggers.

914
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:52,086
Oh, that's the stuff.

915
01:04:52,254 --> 01:04:53,949
Zappers.

916
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,354
Sulfur bombs.

917
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,694
And how do you know of this creature?

918
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,003
Because...

919
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,396
- Because I brought him here.
- Lucas!

920
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:13,734
I knew it. I told you.

921
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:17,675
- Guards, remove this human.
- Come on, kid.

922
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:20,076
- Hova!
- Lucas!

923
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,612
- No.
- Wait. The potion.

924
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:30,248
That's it! Zoc, you shrunk me.
You can shrink the Cloudbreather.

925
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:33,657
We can load these things up and then:

926
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,296
Right in the ear!

927
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,900
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

928
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:41,865
But the Cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree.

929
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:43,629
How do we get close enough?

930
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,330
I've got an idea.

931
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:50,410
Zoc, you would trust this human?

932
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,616
Yoo-hoo, hello?

933
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,781
We need to talk to you.

934
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:06,890
Show yourselves.

935
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:11,163
Down here. Hello?

936
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:22,641
Well, well, well.
Just in time for lunch.

937
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:24,540
- Hello.
- Wait.

938
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:27,307
Listen to me. We come in peace.

939
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:31,647
The exterminator's here. He brings
death clouds that will destroy us all...

940
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,118
...unless we can work together
to stop him.

941
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,081
Death clouds, huh?

942
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,784
Okay, let's eat.

943
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,364
Get behind me.

944
01:06:55,944 --> 01:07:01,382
Sir, the east nest, totally destroyed.

945
01:07:01,783 --> 01:07:04,013
The cloud is coming.

946
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:07,286
The cloud!

947
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,900
What do you have in mind?

948
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:31,871
Remember, you only get one shot at it.

949
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:36,279
Don't fire until you see
the wax of his ears.

950
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:39,079
- Understood.
- Ready? Lucas?

951
01:07:39,254 --> 01:07:42,621
- Good to go.
- Hey. Hey. Stop it. Stop it.

952
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:46,283
Zoc! Can I switch? Mine's broken.

953
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:49,188
All right, boys. Heat them up.

954
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:57,464
Let's fly.

955
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:20,158
Hey, that looks fun. Let's help, shall we?

956
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,992
Okay. I only live two weeks anyway.

957
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,464
Good for you.

958
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:38,173
First wave, attack!

959
01:08:43,418 --> 01:08:46,785
So you want to rumble, huh?
Come on. Come on.

960
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:48,479
Come on!

961
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,124
I'm going in.

962
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:03,134
I can't get through.
He's got some kind of shield.

963
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,836
Craznocks. Headphones!

964
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,394
For queen and colony!

965
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,831
Yeah.

966
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:39,969
Why have you stopped?

967
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:44,636
Oh, geez. Boy, that hurts. Please stop.

968
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,303
Bye-bye.

969
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,185
We'll have to land on him.
Find a way in.

970
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:04,929
He's reloading! Now's our chance.

971
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:11,536
Draw!

972
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,639
Zoc!

973
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:30,422
- Welcome to the scalp.
- Hello.

974
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:32,924
- Have a slice.
- Enjoy.

975
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,553
Fingers!

976
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,825
He's scratching again!

977
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,361
- To the armpit!
- Dive, dive!

978
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:52,112
Leave my friends alone!

979
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:00,378
Don't pick your nose.
Don't pick your nose.

980
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:09,161
- Need a lift?
- Thanks.

981
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,917
No.

982
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:34,049
Hova, are you okay?

983
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:35,780
What?

984
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:39,188
Nighty night.

985
01:11:40,228 --> 01:11:41,456
Run!

986
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,965
Come on, get up!
We got to go, we got to go!

987
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,831
I'm done, little ant.

988
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:59,841
Run! Run!

989
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,948
Lucas, go on.

990
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,212
Save yourself.

991
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,637
That's not the way ants are.

992
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,331
Hurry up.

993
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,818
Lucas? Lucas!

994
01:12:48,763 --> 01:12:50,458
Lucas!

995
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,563
You did it. You did it!

996
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,803
Now, that's an ant.

997
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,205
Oh, sorry.

998
01:13:03,678 --> 01:13:05,942
Thanks, kid.

999
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:17,357
Oh, yeah!

1000
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:21,457
- Our weapons are useless.
- We just need a clear shot.

1001
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:28,068
Hey, wait. A shot.

1002
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,297
Okay, now what?

1003
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:37,468
Well, I don't know,
because I've never attacked before.

1004
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,705
- Isn't that funny?
- Hilarious.

1005
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,743
Oh, look. Here's a way in.

1006
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,622
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

1007
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:54,159
Call Beals-A-Bug
And leave the bug-killing to me

1008
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:04,495
Okay, I'm feeling like we ought to attack
something in here.

1009
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:08,203
Hey, that looks vulnerable.

1010
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,776
Perfect.

1011
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,948
Oh, look. Here's our way out.

1012
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:21,183
Let's give this human a goodbye kiss.

1013
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:25,588
Pucker up, Mr. Beals!

1014
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:53,980
No, no, no.

1015
01:14:54,155 --> 01:14:56,555
Stop. Just get away from me.
Get away from me.

1016
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,590
You can't exterminate me.

1017
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:09,225
Oh, yeah. I'm Stan Beals!

1018
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,133
Oh, no, no, no!

1019
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,870
Praise the Mother!

1020
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,741
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

1021
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:37,855
This day I no longer see
a human among ants...

1022
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,992
...but instead a single colony.

1023
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,139
No more Lucas the Destroyer...

1024
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:48,673
...but Rokai the ant.

1025
01:15:52,013 --> 01:15:54,413
Welcome to the colony.

1026
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,811
Isn't that wonderful?

1027
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:01,985
- Rokai?
- It's an ant name.

1028
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,590
A wizard name.

1029
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:08,428
Rokai has earned his freedom.

1030
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:12,127
And we have earned a friend.

1031
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,469
Remember us.

1032
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:19,934
Hey, Lucas...

1033
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:24,207
I mean, Rokai.
Listen, once you get back...

1034
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:28,076
...if you get the chance, how about
dropping a few sweet rocks now and then?

1035
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:31,412
You know, red ones, preferably.

1036
01:16:31,586 --> 01:16:34,817
Red ones?
I thought you hated the red ones.

1037
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:39,756
Well, I do, but I'm starting to like them.

1038
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:43,729
I'm gonna miss you, Two Legs.

1039
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:46,696
Calling a human "friend."

1040
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:49,564
I thought that impossible until you came.

1041
01:16:49,737 --> 01:16:52,501
But, Zoc, a wizard knows no such word.

1042
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:54,903
Very true.

1043
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:56,708
Here.

1044
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,873
But just wait until you're outside
before you drink it.

1045
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,950
I still think I should have eaten you
when I had the chance.

1046
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,916
I am soft and chewy.

1047
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:08,954
But I promised the queen I wouldn't.

1048
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:11,147
I'm gonna miss you, Hova.

1049
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,920
We're going to miss you too, Rokai.

1050
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,585
Cross our hearts.

1051
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,592
Cross our hearts!

1052
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,437
He's back. He's back!

1053
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:37,779
He's in his birthday suit.
Happy birthday, Lucas!

1054
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,384
Got you that time.

1055
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:52,065
Hi, Tiff. Is everything all right?

1056
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:53,461
Where's Lucas?

1057
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:57,127
Still locked in his room,
hiding from society.

1058
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,167
Mom, hey, Mom!

1059
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,969
- Lucas, what is it?
- I forgot to tell you goodbye.

1060
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,479
Goodbye.

1061
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:09,139
Goodbye, Peanut. Oh, sorry,
I shouldn't call you that.

1062
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,979
It's okay. I don't mind.

1063
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:15,251
Casa, sweet casa.

1064
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,287
These suitcases are muy grande,
my little love nacho.

1065
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:19,926
How about getting the el door-o?

1066
01:18:20,094 --> 01:18:22,358
I don't know what you mean, honey.

1067
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:25,090
- Yeah, honey, the puerta, the...
- What's the puerta?

1068
01:18:25,266 --> 01:18:28,531
- The door, the door!
- The door. Okay, I got it. I got it.

1069
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,268
Hey, Pukas, where you been?
We've been looking for you.

1070
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:39,880
- I think someone's overdue for a dogpile.
- Yeah, dogpile!

1071
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,276
He said dogpile.

1072
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:45,943
Stop saying everything I say, got it?

1073
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,079
Stop saying everything you say. Got it.

1074
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,920
That's it. How about I dogpile you?

1075
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:56,222
How about you leave him alone?
What the craznocks is wrong with you?

1076
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,997
What? How about you make me?

1077
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:04,662
Oh, that's right, you can't.

1078
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:08,935
Because I'm big and you're small.

1079
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:14,874
Yeah, I'm small. We're all small.
But together, we're big.

1080
01:19:15,049 --> 01:19:18,416
You think these stupid losers
are going to team up against me?

1081
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:23,148
I can do anything I want to them,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

1082
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:27,291
And the same goes for you, Pukas.

1083
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,830
Dogpile!

1084
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:35,625
I said, dogpile!

1085
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:40,999
- You heard the man.
- Dogpile!

1086
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:47,340
No! Don't hurt me! Mommy!

1087
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:50,476
Hey, you guys want to come over
and play?

1088
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,950
Yeah, cool. Come on, Lucas.

1089
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,885
I'll catch up.
There's something I gotta do first.

1090
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,890
Yeah! All right!

1091
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,584
Oh, yeah.

1092
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,759
They sure grow up fast.

1093
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,925
- What?
- Look what I got.

1094
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:09,364
Oh, no. Zoc.

1095
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:13,530
Zoc! Wait! Wait! No, no! Stop!

1096
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:15,265
Come on.

1097
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:18,941
Stop it! I'm serious...

1098
01:20:23,918 --> 01:20:25,385
Sweet rocks!

1099
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,591
