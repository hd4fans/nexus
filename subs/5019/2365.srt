00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,360
Come, come, come.

3
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,617
(BRAKE and crash)
Holy shit, bang!

4
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,502
(Yell indistinct)

5
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:05,455
I'm sorry. Sometimes we beat
a word, but we are in Rome.

6
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:12,091
My job, as you can see, you do
so that the traffic moves.

7
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:19,553
I stand here and from there, I see every
thing, every person. I see life.

8
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:23,139
In this city were born many stories.

9
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:29,322
(Firefighter) You see that young man?
Is Roman and is called Michelangelo.

10
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:33,907
Sorry... where the Trevi Fountain?

11
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:38,909
- Er... do two blocks... -
Two blocks away. - And cross the square.

12
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:45,493
- Ok, that is square Mignanelli? - No.
- Piazza di Spagna is there? - No. - Okay.

13
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,630
- This is Piazza Venezia. - Ok.
- I'll show you.

14
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:52,506
- This is square... - Yes?
- Er... - I do not know...

15
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:57,380
- I'll go that way. I'll walk you.
- Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you.

16
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:01,762
- I am American, New York.
- I often go to work in New York.

17
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:05,263
- Then you know well. - Yes
- What do you do? - Advocate.

18
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:08,648
- Did you? Let me guess...
You're a tourist. - Summer holidays.

19
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:10,733
- I'm Hayley.
- Hello, Michelangelo. - Hello.

20
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:31,005
(DIAL NOT AUDIBLE)

21
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:34,382
I'm having an incredible summer.

22
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:37,546
You know, just as we read
in all those romantic books.

23
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:42,174
An American in Rome knows a Roman
fascinating to the Trevi fountain.

24
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,677
No, he is absolutely adorable.

25
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,556
(Firefighter) I'm still me, the policeman.

26
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:52,022
(Firefighter) Even Antonio and Milly
are a young couple in love.

27
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,227
(Firefighter)
I am married and work in Pordenone...

28
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:58,775
... And the journey to Rome, where they want to settle
, it's like a honeymoon.

29
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:09,869
(Yell indistinct)

30
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,453
(Firefighter) Then there is a famous American architect...

31
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:17,883
... That at the end of the holidays,
spend a few days in Rome.

32
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:24,598
(Firefighter) Oh, yes, there is also
Leopoldo Pisanello.

33
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,224
(Firefighter) A Roman citizen normal,
middle class...

34
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,517
... Reliable, pleasant, predictable.

35
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:37,362
It all happened so fast!

36
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:41,353
- I can not wait to introduce my
. - And I know them.

37
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,946
- Is delicious.
- Good, mother, yes.

38
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:50,910
- What do you do, Hayley?
- I'm a freelancer.

39
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,410
I find artwork for my clients.
I graduated in Fine Arts

40
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,708
He is a lawyer. I am very proud...
all my children.

41
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,842
I worked day and night to get them to study.

42
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,135
(Giancarlo)
I would like to know your parents. Come to Rome?

43
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,466
Er... so.
To tell the truth are going to get.

44
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,812
(Pilot) Ladies and gentlemen, we begin the descent
Fiumicino Airport.

45
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,014
(Pilot) Due to the poor condition of the time...

46
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,438
... We have some turbulence.

47
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,569
(Pilot)
Keep belts fastened. Thank you.

48
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,855
Heard? Turbulence!
My favorite.

49
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,528
Try to relax and stop clenching fists.

50
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,739
I can not until there is turbulence.
You know I'm an atheist.

51
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:36,826
- Feel that bounces? -
Do you think we're going to know her boyfriend.

52
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,293
- Look what is communist. -
There is not even the Communist Party here.

53
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,497
No, it's just a lot left.

54
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,046
I too much left at his age, but I was not a communist.

55
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,135
I could never share the bathroom.

56
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:53,558
- It is not a communist. It's just a good Samaritan
. - What do you mean?!

57
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:56,353
What is not interested in material goods.

58
00:05:56,396 --> 00:06:01,687
If you must marry an Italian, I
I have material goods...

59
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:06,646
... A yacht, a couple of Ferrari
and, perhaps, a villa in Sardinia.

60
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:10,861
You do not want our Hayley
marry a "euro-dude"?

61
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,864
I hate when he does these things.

62
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:19,038
- Stop it. - I. .. - Relax. -
I have a bad feeling. - Breathe.

63
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,042
- Please.
- Thank you.

64
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,521
- Like this? - A lot.
- It's beautiful. - Yes, yes.

65
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:44,141
Look, love, it's late.
My uncles are coming. Come on.

66
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,683
Yes, but if you do not like me,
we do?

67
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,821
- Love, but what do you care?
- Be '... - You are so beautiful!

68
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:52,782
You just to be yourself.
Do not worry.

69
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:57,950
They are important people. Maybe a little '
severe, but not put off.

70
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,488
They are nice.

71
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,708
From next week I will be working in their company.

72
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:06,588
I do not want to say or do things that could compromise...

73
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,706
... This wonderful opportunity that we offer.

74
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:13,384
- Will do nicely. To like,
trusted. - Are you? - Of course.

75
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:16,679
Listen, to the speech
that we used to train...

76
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:18,882
Yes, probably
Pordenone I will miss...

77
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,639
... But it is a job that you can not refuse.

78
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:24,687
Do you realize!
If all goes well, we will live in Rome.

79
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,065
Frequenteremo the beautiful people.
We will have children.

80
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:32,902
And maybe one day we will have a
villa with servants, as my uncles.

81
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,940
Yes, but I have to go to the hairdresser.

82
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:38,526
I look like a teacher provincial
with this hair and I do not.

83
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:41,994
- I would be a little 'more chic.
- E'tardi. Now you have to go?

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,455
- It takes me a moment. I do soon.
- I would not make them wait...

85
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:49,499
- Okay. Hurry though, eh?
- Okay.

86
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:53,080
- Hello.
- Hurry up, eh.

87
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,969
I'm sorry,
hairdresser is full.

88
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,549
- There is no one else around here?
- Sure.

89
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:02,429
She leaves the building, go to the right, the second left...

90
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:06,224
... Passes under an arch, and after the arc,
immediately to the right, there is a bridge.

91
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:09,391
After the bridge, the first
left, straight ahead.

92
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,442
- If it is on the right.
- Thank you.

93
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:16,232
In Rome you eat better in Malibu.

94
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,606
I can not wait to do the tourist.

95
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:20,698
John will guide us. He lived here.

96
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:23,910
- Oh, Carol!
It's been thirty years. - So what?!

97
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:27,158
- (Man) supposed to be beautiful then.
- Was fabulous.

98
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,826
I was young, in love with
and completely stupid.

99
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,167
But nothing changes in the Eternal City.

100
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,665
I also want to see the ruins.
In the end, we are in Rome.

101
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:40,964
All those ruins me down.
I am the "melancholy of Melpomene."

102
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:43,136
And then I've seen
when I lived here.

103
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:46,218
Then we'll leave you and I'll see you later, okay?

104
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,684
I do not enjoy doing the tourist.
I prefer to wander the streets.

105
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,893
"Melancholy of Melpomene"!
Where did you find this sentence?

106
00:08:53,942 --> 00:09:16,873
("ROMA SEE YOU" BY RENATO rascel
INSTRUMENTAL VERSION)

107
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:21,833
Er... I'm sorry, she's...
She is John Foye?

108
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:24,092
Yes, how do you know?

109
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:26,379
I recognized it from the picture
Herald Tribune.

110
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,429
- She designs all the commercial centers
. - That's how you see me?

111
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:34,178
- No, I'm an architect, a student of Architecture
. - Really?

112
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,896
- Yes Are you working on a project here in Rome
? - No, holiday.

113
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:40,778
I lived in Rome for a year
when I was your age.

114
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,106
- Really? Where?
- Here in Trastevere.

115
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:49,282
- I live here, in the Baskets.
- He was my hunting ground.

116
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,487
It's all on the day that the
try and I can not find it.

117
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,371
Is just two blocks to the left.

118
00:09:55,418 --> 00:10:00,459
- Well, 'I...
- What? Would you like me to show up?

119
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:03,507
I do not know if I want to see her again.

120
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:09,594
- Er... - Be '...
- Ok. Why not?

121
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:13,760
(RING THE ALARM)

122
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:17,219
This honey to the square of Rome
put it in the middle.

123
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:22,728
Two euro and 18! But it is! Oh!
Come on, finish your breakfast. Thank you.

124
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:25,268
You have to eat. Camilla where is it?

125
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:28,940
Did you see?
Do you know why there's all this unemployment?

126
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:33,488
- Because people are pissed
for the latest technologies. - Yes

127
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:38,330
- What movie do? - Is it too!
- Mangia! Always late!

128
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:57,050
(Indistinct murmur)

129
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:01,680
wherefore the world goes, eventually everything
the planet speak Chinese. According to me.

130
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,401
- Who wants your opinion!
- I I told you.

131
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,313
Do not give a damn about anyone
of what we think.

132
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:11,276
- We just have to pay taxes.
- We pay taxes. - "Eye".

133
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:13,613
Look who it is.

134
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,368
(Leopold) Where were you when I was in the elevator
closed two hours?

135
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:21,498
Being young and unmarried...
Or, at least, one of the two.

136
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,499
- Did you see when he did so?
- Be '? - Beautiful!

137
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:28,123
- Do not combineresti nothing. - Why?
- The weekend passes them on his head.

138
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:31,459
- (Leopold) But when?
- (Man) always.

139
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,713
- If you want my opinion...
- Again! - Can I say something?!

140
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,922
I think...

141
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:40,806
- Is an enigmatic film,
very interesting. - I did not understand anything.

142
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,343
It is the most beautiful of "The King's Speech."

143
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:46,232
- What tartagliava it was more beautiful.
- What do you mean? - I do not understand.

144
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:49,192
- E'voluto author.
- Why?! - Not at all wanted!

145
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:52,604
- The incomprehensibility of life...
- Let's eat?

146
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:54,778
- Did you see that shot...
- Yes

147
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,861
- If I had to vote for an Oscar, not
I would have doubts. - But you do not vote...

148
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,662
- Who is it? Maria! - I want to see.
- If I had to vote...

149
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:04,619
(Yell indistinct)

150
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,039
I did not understand, but I think Brad Pitt.

151
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:11,246
(TV) "Questasettimana
interviewing TonyBlalr..."

152
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:15,676
"... The winner of Miss Universe
and Johnny Depp."

153
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:21,553
(Phyllis) My God,
look at this city!

154
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,639
- Here.
- The're giving a tip in euro.

155
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,520
When you realize what you gave him, you are a heart attack.

156
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:32,648
- Gave us a great room.
- Yes - And I'm happy to be here.

157
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:36,857
You have always traveled for work.
It's not nice to be here for fun?

158
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:42,411
- No! I... I miss work.
I do not like to be retired. - Be '...

159
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:47,448
I still think I'll end up as an old man...

160
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,450
... In a nursing home
watching TV in the group...

161
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,540
... And drool with the attached
colostomy pouch.

162
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,837
- For you board the equivalent
death. - Yes, that's right.

163
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,459
But it's your imagination,
because you're not dying.

164
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:06,674
No, I'm not dying now, but
is plausible that happen to me one day.

165
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:10,012
That is, even if I'm talking
between fifty and sixty years.

166
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,017
- I get a bit 'of water? - Of course.
Your wish is my command.

167
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:17,064
Thank you. I did not leave a mark,
I did not realize what I wanted.

168
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:21,774
You did very well. Only
have a little ahead of its time.

169
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:25,490
I have a lot ahead of time.
You married a very smart.

170
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:28,703
I have a Q.I. of 150, 160.

171
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:32,746
're Calculating in euro.
In dollars is a lot less, honey.

172
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,370
(SHOTS AT THE DOOR)

173
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:43,174
- Hello! - Honey! - Hello, Mom!
Hello! Hello, Dad! - Hello, baby.

174
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,091

- She is my mother.
- Pleasure. - Nice to meet you.

177
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:54,685
- You've done a good trip?
- Yes, a great trip.

178
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,056
Bounced a little on landing, but...

179
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:01,901
I read in the newspaper, if the line
air retrieve the black box.

180
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:06,692
- We would like to get married around Christmas.
- Really? - Yes

181
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,993
- You're a lawyer, "Miguelangelo."
- Michelangelo.

182
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:13,122
- "Michel", "Michel". - Yes
- I call it "Michel", right?

183
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,246
- Yes, the oppressed,
those who can not pay. - Ah!

184
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:20,746
Legal aid.
She will roll up their sleeves.

185
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:24,961
- Er... you want something to drink?
- Thank you. - Yes

186
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,257
- Er... Water. - Water. -
Do you want some water? - Yes - The water is fine.

187
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:32,971
- Hayley told me that
work in the field of music. - I'm retired.

188
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:37,431
I worked in the classical music section of a record company.

189
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:41,395
- I staged operas
for many years. - You know, Dad...

190
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:46,781
- His great-grandfather knew Verdi.
- Seriously! - Yes

191
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:49,658
I have set up some greens.

192
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,785
Basic stuff I was avant-garde, atonal
things...

193
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,913
... But I revisited a couple of classics.

194
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,744
staged an edition of "Rigoletto"...

195
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,710
... Where all the characters were dressed as white mice.

196
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:06,416
(Jerry) And once a "Tosca"
where everyone was in a phone booth.

197
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:13,134
- Jerry won the day. - Yes, I was
in advance for massive success.

198
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:18,258
In other words, the productions were... Be ',
among critics, costs and unions...

199
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:21,977
- Excuse me, does not agree
on unions? - Er...

200
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:26,935
- Well, 'the unions... -
Without them the worker would be oppressed.

201
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:34,152
- Yes, I understand what you say,
"Miguelangelo"... - Michelangelo.

202
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:39,658
- How? - Michelangelo. - "Michel".
- Yes, as "Miguelangelo", the painter.

203
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,664
Only he, for some reason,
"Michel"...

204
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,707
Michelangelo gets angry very
care for workers.

205
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,459
(Yell indistinct)

206
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:56,179
Excuse me...  Excuse me, can you tell me where is
because of the pen?

207
00:15:56,223 --> 00:16:00,303
Er... Er... Ah, yes... ah, yes...

208
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:03,104
Well, take the first right.

209
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:07,524
- Take a hundred meters.
- Yes - You will find an ice cream parlor.

210
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:15,479
Then go on that way for 50 meters and
Livada... left.

211
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,573
- Thank you.
- Please.

212
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,673
At the next traffic light crossing the road.

213
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:35,836
There is a seafood restaurant,
can not go wrong.

214
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:41,805
It is still on, turn right, then
another 100 meters and turn right again.

215
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,845
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you. - Please.

216
00:16:46,897 --> 00:17:23,057

(RING OF CELLULAR AND thud)

219
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:37,608
(PHONE RINGING AVUOTO)

220
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,736
Well, I live here.

221
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:47,362
Oh! Of course, this was just
my way!

222
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,869
- Can I ask for a coffee?
- A cup of coffee?

223
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,952
Yes, it is. Sally is very good.

224
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:57,000
- Sally! - Yes, my girlfriend.
She studied here.

225
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:02,173
- Sally, you there? - Hello. -
I brought a person who has lived here.

226
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:05,054
- Ah! But really?
- John Foye Yes, she is Sally. - Wow!

227
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,382
- Hi. - Pleasure. - Sally.
It's amazing! - I know.

228
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:12,217
- You're right, it's adorable. - Yes, it is wonderful
. - Can I get you anything?

229
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:15,188
- I'll give you a coffee? - Yes, thank you.
- What a great idea, honey. Thank you.

230
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:19,940
I forgot! My friend Monica
is coming to Rome.

231
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:24,031
- I told her she could stay with us.
- Well. So I know, finally.

232
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:27,692
It is just left with her boyfriend...
so is "disconnected".

233
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:31,409
- Trouble in view, clouds
the Eternal City. - Why trouble?

234
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:38,668
You'll like it a lot. It's smart, it's fun and
... interesting.

235
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:43,873
The men adore. I think it is
to the sexual energy that radiates.

236
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,797
- And how long will it stop?
- I do not know.

237
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:50,973
Among the break with her boyfriend and
acting career did not take off that...

238
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:54,467
- Do not you see that the situation is fraught with danger
! - Please!

239
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,146
I'm not looking for anything.
I am very happy with Sally.

240
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:03,899
Judging from the description, Monica
is neurotic and unpredictable.

241
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:07,397
Beautiful, funny, smart, sexy and even neurotic
?

242
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:10,366
It's as if you entered a Royal Flush.

243
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,787
Monica... Even the name is sexy.

244
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:35,219
(Yell indistinct)

245
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,222
(SHOTS AT THE DOOR)

246
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,525
- Congratulations. - Yes?
- I have your super gift.

247
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:53,024

A special gift for a special man.

248
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:56,196
- What would this special gift

249
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:59,033
Is already all paid for.
I'm all yours, all yours.

250
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:02,913
- Look, there must be a mistake.
- Perqualunque what you want.

251
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,910
- Ah, yes? Please, go away.
- I can not. Those upset.

252
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:12,469
- Who?! - They told me that you're stressed and
you'd be surprised.

253
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,010
- But you are the lucky winner.
- Winner of what?!

254
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,761
- The winner of the bet.
- But what bet!

255
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,518
Domi and Fabio have paid me and told me
to congratulate you.

256
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:26,019
What they were wrong and that you need
accept their apologies.

257
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:31,736
- These two gentlemen do not know them.
Can go out? - I can not speak.

258
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,065
-
I am here to fulfill your dreams. - Where you going?!

259
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,034
Please, Miss, can go out?

260
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:41,328
But you're Mr. Debroca,
room 504.

261
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm not Mr. Debroca
and the room is right.

262
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,206
- You, please, leave now...
- Is anyone there?

263
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:54,379
- Sorry, sorry.
- I told you to wait.

264
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:58,258
No, it is not what you think.
Have a seat, please.

265
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:01,508
We were to meet at noon, the door was open...

266
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,015
- So do not enter without knocking!
- Nice way to meet your wife!

267
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:10,065
- It is not my wife.
- No!

268
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,185
I hope you're joking.

269
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:17,904
Of course I'm kidding.
Is my wife.

270
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,276
I am Uncle Paul.

Uncle Sal.

273
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:29,282
Aunt Rita.

274
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,043
Anna.

275
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:36,294
- Anna! But do not call Milly!
- Milly! Be '...

276
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:40,386
Milly, of course, Milly.
Anna is the second name.

277
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,587
- Milly!
- Milly.

278
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,684
We are waiting below,
do not worry. Come on.

279
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:50,309
- Paul... - Yes
- Yes, yes. - AAfter.

280
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,403
I want to die! My life is over!
I am ruined!

281
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:02,365
Tell him the truth, that there was a mistake
.

282
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:06,905
But how?! They've seen
on the bed! I am in my underwear...

You will understand... Those think...
Do not ever convince them, is useless.

284

'll Think I called an escort.
Why do you jumped on him!

285
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:21,043
I was paid to make love with Mr.
Debroca.

286
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:25,091
- And leave the door open! - Yes
- Are you an idiot? - I thought it was closed.

287
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:29,884
These are believed upscale
authorized to everything.

288
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:33,386
Milly's coming.
We have to get out of here.

289
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:36,060
You have to pretend to be my wife.

290
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:40,188
I pretend to be your wife?
I'm not an actress.

291
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:43,902
- And what's more, I've just called
"idiot". - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

292
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:49,453
I need your help, because if he comes
Milly, I'll jump out the window.

293
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:53,279
- Do not you understand that sooner or later
discover everything? - Are you?

294
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,120
I need time,
then I invent something.

295
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,169
It is important that we leave immediately
and go away.

296
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:03,465
- (Sally) Walk faster!
- (Jack) Relax!

297
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:07,209
- The flight must have landed!
- It will take at least an hour.

298
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:11,640
- Hope you do not fall in love with her.
- What the hell does that mean?!

299
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:17,140
- Men are always...
crazy about her. - Well, 'I'm crazy about you.

300
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,976
Ok. Here it is! It's her! Monica!

301
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:26,729
- Hello! I'm so glad!
- Hello!

302
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:32,286
- You are a beauty!
- Stop it! You're a beauty!

303
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:36,492
- Nothing special, right?
- No. I mean, no thrill.

304
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,783
Do you think this would be the "femme fatale"!

305
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:44,873
Sure, it's been 14 hours in the air, but you
admit that there is something in her.

306
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,916
If something arouses in me belongs to the subconscious.

307
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,878
I do not notice it at all. It is certainly a formidable
seductress.

308
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,682
Unemployed is an actress and crumpled.

309
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,769
- What fantastic! It was so long...
- Hello, I sonoJack.

310
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,940
- She is Monica. - Hello. - Pleasure.
- I must look awful.

311
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,604
- I got it. - Do not make judgments
rushed. - No, you look great.

312
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,103
, over time, like me. Is that
I can not sleep on the plane.

313
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,646
I took a Scotch and 3 Ambien, but...

314
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,487
There is already a certain intimacy in this return.

315
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,074
I have no interest in Monica.

316
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,909
I just hope it does not interfere with my work.

317
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:25,414
There is an element of excitement, a
germ, a spark, a molecule...

318
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:30,172
God! I see it so clearly now.
But is age.

319
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:35,429
- Thank you, a wonderful dinner. - Thank you.
- You're getting a great cook.

320
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:40,015
Since it was your night here
why not dine at home?

321
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,761
Yes, it's perfect, just the three of us.
Ma .. you're reading?

322
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:48,310
- The poems of Yeats.
- "That gong tormented by the sea..."

323
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,060
- Yes, yes, you know? - You want to talk about
break with Donald?

324
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:58,152
', Donald was gay and it was my
ego to believe to be able to change it.

325
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:02,496
- It is not gone, but believe me, I tried
. - And how do you groped?

326
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,874
Well ', I mean...
I would not go into details, but... be '...

327
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,966
I've got it all set and
is a pity because he is wonderful.

328
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:17,137
It's so bright out of bed.
It was fun to be with him.

329
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,678
I have tried to prove that sex with a woman...

330
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:25,220
... Can be as exciting as it
with one of the same sex.

331
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:30,098
And he tried. Him ..
has tried, but in the end, nothing.

332
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,143
(Monica) Losses total, yes.

333
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:35,313
But you have fun when you brought her to Paris.

334
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:39,990
- Have you ever had sex with a man?
- I! Sex with a man! No.

335
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:43,285
Not at all.
Is not something that interests me. I mean...

336
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:48,999
- Why go red? Probably
why would you try. - I...

337
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:52,792
I have always had a great desire
going to bed with a woman.

338
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,085
When I finally did was very intense...

339
00:25:57,134 --> 00:26:01,298
... Something very exciting, but
disturbing.

340
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:05,724
- I have not suppressed any...
- Once I turned a TV movie...

341
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:09,635
One of the scenes was an incredible
model lingerie.

342
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:12,523
I swear I took away your breath.

343
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:16,646
One day I get a message
dall'aiutoregista...

344
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:20,360
... That Miss Lee
wanted to see me in his dressing room.

345
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:26,030
Why was all of a sudden,
so obsessed with me I do not know.

346
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,237
So I go there.

347
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:34,125
She is Terry...
And if one takes it away.

348
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,081
And kisses me holding me close to him.

349
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:45,302
And I...  I... I... lost his head.
I have lost my mind.

350
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:51,350
I was so excited... You must believe me,
was too good to say no.

351
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:57,097
This went on for three months.

352
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:01,984
Yes, it was like living in a
erotic dream.

353
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,988
On the one hand, it was very exciting.

354
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:10,071
But on the other hand,
I was very confused.

355
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:13,870
Then I began to see an analyst
5 days a week.

356
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:18,911
Luckily Jamal arrived and we started a relationship
exceptional.

357
00:27:19,714 --> 00:27:26,333
And if you have been great orgasms
had with Victoria...

358
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:30,847
... Those with Jamal
were more grandiose and much less confusing.

359
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,178
I'm sorry.

360
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:40,685
- Is special. - Yes, I need some
minutes to recover from the story.

361
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:43,653
- I'm still sweating.
- I find it fun.

362
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:45,942
Yes, but in the end got?

363
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:50,366
Nothing  career, no relationship,
sleeping pills, analysts...

364
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,945
I think you're trying to convince yourself.

365
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:57,994
I have a great idea.
Why not go for a walk?

366
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:02,087
No, I'm exhausted.
But you take it easy, no, Jack?

367
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,293
- No, it would be a catastrophe!
- Why are you so worried?!

368
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,545
- You think of me as a seductress.
This is your problem. - Bales.

369
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:13,094
You invented the story with
modeling lingerie to provoke him.

370
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,849
No, it was true, almost all. Ok, I exaggerate a little
, I love infiocchettare.

371
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:21,429
- It's part of my charm creative.
- Come on, why do not you?

372
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:24,732
Sally, you must not leave them alone.

373
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:40,996
(DIAL NOT AUDIBLE)

374
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:46,877
(RINGER DELLASVEGLIA)

375
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:53,967
(DIAL NOT AUDIBLE)

376
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:14,981
(indistinct and yell excitedly)

377
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:21,403
What's the matter?! Are you crazy!
Go! You have the wrong person!

378
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:25,370
Sofia! Sofia! Coupons!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

379
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:29,036
- Sofia! But what happens!
- What do you want?!

380
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:35,292
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

381
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:39,128
(Leopold) call the police!
Go away! I am a serious person!

382
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:44,520
I'm going to work!
I have to go to work! These are crazy!

383
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,432
- What is this car?!
- Getting late to study!

384
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:52,937
- But I'm late for work!
- Venga. - Sofia! - Have a seat.

385
00:29:52,986 --> 00:29:55,524
Sofia... come along.
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

386
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:06,782
(DIAL NOT AUDIBLE)

387
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,247
Hello and welcome to TG3.

388
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:19,505
Today we have a special guest:
Leopoldo Pisanello.

389
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:23,807
- Welcome, Mr. Pisanello.
Welcome to TG3. - Thank you, yes...

390
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:27,141
Excuse me, but why am I here?

391
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:31,266
To answer our questions,
to our interview.

392
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:34,232
- What did you have for breakfast?
- I!

393
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:40,444
Er... white coffee and two slices of bread with butter and jam
.

394
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,491
Two slices of bread... And how?

395
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:46,278
Good... roasted.

396
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:50,279
- Ah, so she prefers
toast. - Yes, that's right, yes.

397
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,120
Why? I ask him?

398
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:59,254
Mah .. uh... I do not know. Just like that
I usually prefer the toast.

399
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,167
- (Journalist) White or wholemeal?
- White.

400
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,592
So we can say without a shadow of a doubt...

401
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:09,637
... Leopold Pisanello prefer two slices of toast.

402
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,978
Yes, and a latte... without sugar.

403
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:20,651
- (Journalist)
The beard has done before or after breakfast? - Er...

404
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:27,742
(Yell indistinct)

405
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,570
- Extraordinary!
- I!

406
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,615
It!

407
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:40,005
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

408
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:43,884
Still here! Enough! Go! Sofia!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

409
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:46,458
Sofia! Go away!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

410
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:51,512
Leopoldo! You were great!

411
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,259
- The phone never stopped ringing
. - Yes, but...

412
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:58,099
You want the news of tomorrow 20:00.

413
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,066
- What are you saying! I! But why?!
- You're famous!

414
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:07,030
- Er... - 95. - 95...
- I do not know, I can not find the address.

415
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:12,743
This is the 91, that is 93...

416
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:17,081
- It can not be 95! There are
the funeral! - Here we go.

417
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:21,419
- How's that?! - Mr. Santoli
do this job. - Seriously!

418
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:25,127
Has a funeral.
Do not make it so long.

419
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:28,377
Jesus! The son of a communist
and the father is a "gravedigger"...

420
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:30,467
The mother runs a leper!

421
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:35,139
- I think that dress above.
- Excuse me, is this the 95?

422
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:40,344
- Yes, it's 95. Santoli? - Yes, yes.
- Someone has died?

423
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:44,609
- No, but it is better to predict.
- No, we are the parents of Hayley.

424
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:47,985
- The parents of Hayley! - Yes
- Welcome!

425
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,781
It is a great pleasure to meet you!

426
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:54,193
Sorry, I have not yet washed.
I work all day...

427
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:57,695
- Please, take a seat as well.
We live here. - Thank you.

428
00:32:57,747 --> 00:33:00,119
- Please. - Thank you. - Follow me.
Have a good trip?

429
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,455
- Yes, wonderful.
- Well!

430
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:07,171
- Please, have a seat. - Thank you.
- Mariangela, come!

431
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:11,758
- They came the parents of Hayley.
- Hi. - Pleasure. - Phyllis eJerry.

432
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:16,797
- Hi. - Good morning. - Here
no one ever comes. - Oh, no? - No.

433
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:20,977
- Here. - What do you drink? - Thank you.
- The wine is fine.

434
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,890
Michelangelo and Hayley arrive shortly.

435
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:26,940
I'm sorry, but I have to wash andarmi.
Is a must.

436
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:31,562
- Mariangela, open the bottle and take a drink
. - I'm going to open it.

437
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:35,563
- Meanwhile you sit down.
- Ok. - Be right back. - Yes

438
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:39,865
- (Hayley)'s us!
- (Michelangelo) Mom! - Hello!

439
00:33:39,913 --> 00:33:42,830
- Hello! - Hi. -
Have you found the right place, right?

440
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:47,203
We followed a hearse
and we arrived.

441
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:50,704
- You have arrived! Well! - Hello.
- Taste my specialties.

442
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:53,841
The green ones are a kind of "tapenade".

443
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:57,929
- Yes, Try them, they're great.
- Ah, ok. - No. ..

444
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:07,521
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It is delicious.
I will never be so.

445
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:11,479
- I will teach you.
Teach her to make croutons. - Yes, it is.

446
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:15,227
- No, really... - Come on!
- Is a cooking class for free!

447
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,281
- I do not want to disturb. - I'll
assistant. - Come. - No. ..

448
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:21,444
Eat one. I'm going to see.

449
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,154
Please.

450
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:31,244
Formaldehyde!

451
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:37,131
(Giancarlo) The time has fled...

452
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:45,432
(Giancarlo) and die in despair!

453
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:54,313
And die in despair!

454
00:34:55,235 --> 00:35:06,113
And I amatoma the
tantola life!

455
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:20,044
(Giancarlo) win!

456
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,757
He showed me how to do...

457
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:26,255
... But here are the fresh mozzarella
that arrives daily from Naples.

458
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:30,102
- What do you do, Phyllis?
- I'm a "shrink".

459
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,973
Oh! It is a psychiatrist!

460
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,563
I've never been to Naples,
but I know it is beautiful.

461
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,898
Do not know what the Neapolitan cuisine.

462
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:41,937
You know Italy well, Jerry?

463
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:47,275
- Jerry, you asked a question.
- Eh?

464
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:50,363
Ah! Yes, yes, Naples...

465
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:57,586
Did you ever take singing lessons,
Giancarlo?

466
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:00,629
Singing lessons! No. Why?

467
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:05,504
You sing so naturally?

468
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:10,298
I'm not a singer.
Same song for me, since I was little.

469
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:15,260
- You have a fantastic, beautiful voice.
- Yes

470
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:20,437
But no! She says I do
just too noisy here at home.

471
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:25,644
- (Jerry) Has no one heard?
- Caruso is our staff.

472
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:31,984
You have a wonderful voice.
Have you ever thought to make something?

473
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:34,907
He sings for his own pleasure,
not for money.

474
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:39,333
There is a certain amount of money in
pleasure, a pleasure rustling.

475
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,619
- You groped banknotes.
- Oh...

476
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,506
I'm not a singer.

477
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:49,833
I... I do not know, I...

478
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:55,178
It is possible that, after dinner,
you sing something for me?

479
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:59,389
Who, me?! No, I feel embarrassed
, no.

480
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:03,056
- No, I'm here, among us.
- No, please.

481
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:06,442
- Michelangelo, tell him too.
- Yes

482
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:12,774
I have a friend here in Rome
it big.

483
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:18,282
If you only sing...
He ​​is very competent.

484
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:23,787
If you, when you're free, when you're not
cremating someone could...

485
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:28,166
- Look, he already said no.
- Michelangelo, but the gentleman...

486
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:31,419
With Dad is useless to insist.
It's not a singer.

487
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:35,087
- You do not want him to do a bad
figure. - Jerry, get it over with.

488
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:41,557
Ok, I'm done.
I will not say another word. I'm done.

489
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:48,105
But the guy has a fantastic voice and you...
Ok, dumb.

490
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,524
Forget it. The subject is closed.

491
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,438
But he has a great voice!
Someone should do something about it.

492
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:57,527
- Not me. - Jerry...
- I do not speak to me...

493
00:37:57,577 --> 00:38:03,117
- This man is a genius.
- Enough. - He has a natural talent.

494
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:08,408
I'm not saying anything. I'm just...
I mean, I... Closed the topic.

495
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:13,753
(Heading) Great item, great.
As a true star. A beautiful talent.

496
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:18,803
- What do you call the hotel?
- I do not remember.

497
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:24,968
- It is in the center? - Yes, more or less.
Was... was red...

498
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,487
Here. Sorry for the delay.
We have been waiting for.

499
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,614
Er... yes... uh...

500
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:45,702
(Sighing) You could not get...
Something simpler?

501
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:49,034
We need to meet people rather important.

502
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:52,121
- We like you dressed like that.
- How!

503
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:55,006
But some of our fellow
may not understand.

504
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:59,129
- I lost my suitcase in the train,
then that's it. - Ah, well.

505
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:04,219
Um...  Well, we have organized a trip
private Vatican.

506
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:09,391
- Beautiful. True love? - Yes,
I know him well. - Come on, then.

507
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:14,349
- I hope that do enter.
- I do not do so enter!

508
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:19,312
- Miss... are you okay?
- Yes, yes, thank you.

509
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:23,279
Thanks, but...

510
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:28,321
Oh, but... but... but she is...
But she is Pia Fusari?

511
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:32,827
He recognized?

512
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:38,381
Yes, but you... Oh, my God, but she
is one of my favorite actresses!

513
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,880
I'm flattered.

514
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:46,929
But as you walk down the street here
like a normal person?

515
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,093
We're making a movie here.

516
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:55,562
- (Pia) Will you come to see?
- I!

517
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,600
Yes!

518
00:39:58,277 --> 00:40:00,684
Yes!

519
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:04,652
(Milly) Oh...
But that is Juliet Falcone!

520
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:11,746
(Milly) No! There Luca Jump! I love
Luke Salta, is so charismatic!

521
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,782
(Milly) No, I do not believe it!

522
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:18,877
It's amazing: he painted the ceiling
lying on scaffolding.

523
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:24,212
Working
all the time lying on my back! I can not imagine!

524
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,047
I do, perfectly.

525
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,762
Damn, I'm late to class.
You can carry around Monica today?

526
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:35,889
- No, today, no.
I have to work in these drawings. - Please!

527
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,511
- I do not know anything about Rome.
- No.

528
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:41,056
Do not have time to go to see
Coliseum for the millionth time.

529
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:44,110
- Come on, do it for me.
- Er...

530
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,648
- Thank you.
- Ok.

531
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:57,704
(Monica) is impressive.
With those lines and spaces...

532
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,163
(Jack) There is so much space to the negative.
Do not you will hide from something?

533
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:07,290
(Monica) No, I was worried
to distract you from work.

534
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:13,262
(Jack) No, I figured, I like it.
If it were not for you, I would do it alone.

535
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:16,972
(Jack) It's amazing that the Coliseum
is still here after thousands of years!

536
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,352
Sally and I have to repaint the bathroom
every six months.

537
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,849
These guys were really the architects fabulous.

538
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:28,562
The great irony here is that once there was a magnificent civilization...

539
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:32,065
... And now only the ruins.

540
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:40,789
- I call this sense of futility...
The "melancholy of Melpomene." - Ok.

541
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,327
(Monica) This is the kind of thing you want to achieve
?

542
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,704
(Jack)
I would be proud to have designed it.

543
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:48,998
(Monica) Have you always wanted to do
architect?

544
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,719
(Jack) You start to laugh when I tell
what my greatest aspiration.

545
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:56,257
- (Monica) What is it? No, do not laugh.
- (Jack) Designing structures extremes.

546
00:41:56,307 --> 00:42:00,387
(Jack) I would like to scandal,
change the architectural landscape...

547
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:04,599
- Ate interested in architecture?
- I am interested in Gaudi. - Ah.

548
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,020
Antoni Gaudi.

549
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:11,895
For me, the Sagrada Familia
is a poem in stone.

550
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,616
Bullshit!
You were only six months in college.

551
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,279
Do not know anything about architecture,
except name a few.

552
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,577
Have you seen the movie "The Fountainhead."

553
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:27,917
I'm so sexy that young
architect's uncompromising film.

554
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:35,258
I would do anything to pass
a night with the young architect.

555
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,295
God, spare me, please!

556
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,300
Another young woman who wants to give his body to Gary Cooper.

557
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,507
- Come on! It's fun to talk to her.
- Sure.

558
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,305
You drink his bales because it seems
to know the right things to say.

559
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,432
Knows the names, terms of fashion...

560
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,694
... Some quotes that are educated
think of her as one who knows.

561
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,532
"The anxiety of influence",
string quartets of Bartok...

562
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,735
... The perversion of the dialectic, the Sagrada Familia...

563
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:03,323
... "Gong tormented by the sea"...

564
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:07,325
I should put it to narrow and does not allow the display of names?

565
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:12,749
- But you did not. - In the end, that
is a fraud, is fascinating.

566
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:17,340
Yeah, the girl has something special that
beats all logic.

567
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:22,177
So... continues,
thrown between the propeller blades.

568
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:26,891
It went well with Monica?

569
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:29,853
I have no time to carry it around.
I'm trying to work.

570
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:33,313
- I was taken back
insecurity today. - Stop it

571
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,571
Maybe this was not a good idea to make
out together all day.

572
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,488
- And if you felt attracted to her?
- Will you stop worrying?

573
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:43,568
Pseudointellectual is a narcissist.
Yes, it's pretty and with this?

574
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:48,410
- Yes, it's very pretty. - It's nice.
In short, not in the conventional way.

575
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:53,533
I would like to find someone.
There will be a friend to fix it.

576
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:57,590
- Yes, I'm sure that someone
rimediamo. - Who?

577
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,748
What do you think of Leonardo Basso?

578
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,881
Is a nice guy, smart,
earn a lot of "grain"...

579
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,548
I think he left with a
that she was an actress.

580
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,728
- Awesome! You could call it?
- Sure. I will pander. - Well.

581
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:15,642
Please sit down, Mr. Pisanello.

582
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:21,147
- This will be his new office.
- My new office!

583
00:44:21,196 --> 00:44:24,197
Ma .. but I'm an employee.

584
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:27,158
(Chuckling) Very funny.

585
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:32,789
Serafina, come. Look
famous person we have in our company.

586
00:44:32,832 --> 00:44:36,332
- Good morning. - You take care of her,
with everything they need.

587
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:40,292
- All day.
- With pleasure. - Thank you.

588
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,831
- You will take care of me
all day? - Yes

589
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:47,130
- Whatever he needed,
I'm here. - Yes

590
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:54,725
(yell indistinct)

591
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,768
Calm down.
(Yell indistinct)

592
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:03,727
- How did it go his day?
- My day? - Yes

593
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:06,234
It went well.

594
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:10,694
I spilled coffee on it is certain
documents, but I've taken on the fly.

595
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:12,986
For the rest, well, well, well.

596
00:45:13,038 --> 00:45:16,786
Have you heard? Mr. Pisanello
happened to spill the coffee.

597
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:21,874
But his reflexes
avoided the tragedy...

598
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:24,674
... With the probable loss of human lives.

599
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:26,750
But why has spilled coffee?

600
00:45:26,801 --> 00:45:30,217
Will be the deepening of the news of 21:00, with distinguished guests...

601
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:34,805
... What the leaders of Illy,
the ambassador of Brazil and the UN.

602
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,057
Mr. Pisanello a statement.

603
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,261
- A statement!
- Yes, a statement.

604
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:45,433
- A statement... so?
- Tell us something. - So?

605
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:49,732
I think... I think... Ah, maybe it's raining.

606
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:53,115
You heard it. Pisanello
Leopold says it could rain.

607
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,567
Can you tell us how to sleep tonight?

608
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,700
I normally sleep on my back.

609
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:02,536
Leopoldo Pisanello
sleep on your back.

610
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:05,539
Have you ever slept  on the stomach?

611
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:10,250
No, I suffer a bit 'of gastritis.
Not a serious thing...

612
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,839
- On the belly I do not like. It will be...
- How much?

613
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:17,181
- But enough! Please! Stop it!
- It's important! - Enough!

614
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:20,095
But enough! Go!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

615
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,726
What do you want?! How to sleep...
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

616
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:29,561
What do you think? I only have these printed dresses
dime.

617
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:33,276
I have to buy something now that you're so famous.

618
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:37,155
Sofia, I'm tired, I have a headache.
Forget it.

619
00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:40,737
I had a terrible day.
Do not go to the premiere of the film.

620
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:45,664
How! But we must go!
We keep to our presence.

621
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,497
Sofia, but who?! But who cares!

622
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:52,923
Would you tell me that, without Leopoldo
Pisanello, do not give the first?

623
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:58,756
- Sure! - But Sofia, I am Mr.
"Foolish any".

624
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:03,349
And you're my wife, the wife of Mr.
"Foolish any".

625
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:06,145
You said you'd go.

626
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:24,529
(Applauses and ovations calm)

627
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:26,787
(Man) is Gina Francone.

628
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,324
(Applauses and ovations calm)

629
00:47:29,377 --> 00:47:32,580
(Man) Ah! Here Tony Branca.

630
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,121
(Applauses and ovations calm)

631
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:39,883
(Man) There he is. Good evening.
Good evening. Prejudice.

632
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,214
(Man) But who do I see? Here it is!
Leopoldo Pisanello.

633
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:46,765
(APPLAUSl, WHISTLES and standing ovations)

634
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:50,226
(Man) is accompanied by the lovely Sofia
.

635
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:55,230
(Man) Very elegant, with this dress
dime.

636
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:59,820
(Woman) Yes, Sofia is wearing a dress printed cotton
dime...

637
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:04,158
... And a coat that seems to take a stand
Charity.

638
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:08,414
- (Man) Yes, definitely. - And I
I've ever... a laddered stocking.

639
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:13,581
We're checking. Yes, it is a
gap in left stocking.

640
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:18,171
Lady Pisanello, the ladder,
tell us, is desired?

641
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:22,083
- I have a ladder? - Yes,
is very impressive, very fashionable.

642
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,129
(Woman) Do not see, Martina?

643
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,383
- Then we will see soon in Cannes?
- Absolutely.

644
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:30,220
- Well, sorry, but there's Gina Franconi.
- Please.

645
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:35,061
- Mr. Pisanello. - Yes? - I
Marisa Raguso, his fan. - Thank you.

646
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:40,350
I think she is very sexy
most of all these players "frocetti"...

647
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:42,480
... Making superhero movies.

648
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:46,742
- Sure. - It would be nice to have a little
'more time to talk.

649
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:50,735
- I would like to know what you think of
cultural situation in Italy. - I?

650
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:55,877
Tell you what, I'll give you my phone number
. Call me.

651
00:48:55,877 --> 00:48:59,162
- Your Number?
- Anytime. - All right.

652
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,298
- Mr. Pisanello, tell us the truth.
- Yes - He wears briefs or boxers?

653
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:11,180
- Er... I boxers, wide, white.
- I knew it! I always knew!

654
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:15,768
Clearly, he is a boxer from her.
Is a fig! I knew it!

655
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:41,000
(DIAL NOT AUDIBLE)

656
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,038
(JACK SIGH)

657
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:48,751
- So, how do you feel now that you've
arranged with your friend? - I do not know.

658
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:52,136
Fun we found Sally and I come to visit these ruins.

659
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,754
Yeah, and then what happened?

660
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:59,885
- I regret having presented
Leonardo. - Yes, you're jealous.

661
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:03,770
All of a sudden, I wanted to be with her
in a room and tell her that I love her.

662
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:07,897
I have not tried anything so far
afternoon and suddenly...

663
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:10,354
Her face haunts me.

664
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:15,532
I love what wears her hair.
She was exceptional.

665
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:24,918
- So, you like Monica?
- Is adorable.

666
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:29,043
- I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
- Oh yeah? The need to revise?

667
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:32,970
- Tomorrow night.
- Me and Sally are free tomorrow night.

668
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,963
It is better if we go out just the two of us.

669
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:40,008
- Please.
- It brings the menu, please? - Now.

670
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,807
(Jerry) Giancarlo, I
allowed to call my friend.

671
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:48,724
- I fixed an audition society
label. - I said no!

672
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:52,027
But why?!
What's wrong with people alive!

673
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,986
You can not have only to do with
people with rigor mortis.

674
00:50:56,034 --> 00:51:01,704
You have an exceptional voice.
You should sing "I Pagliacci" for the crowd.

675
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:05,698
- "Clowns"! - "Clowns",
yes. You were born to sing.

676
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:10,461
- I've always wanted to sing it.
- Of course, your voice is a gift.

677
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:16,426
- Listen to me: we will go away.
- "We"! - We, yes.

678
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:22,094
I will make you as a manager and put
on the scene for you, "I Pagliacci."

679
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:26,092
Believe me, I know what to do.
Trust me.

680
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:30,808
Do not know why I'm crying, because
you're in front of me. Believe me.

681

685
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:06,056
#... And hope.

# No, no! On your mouth #
down stars... Win!

689
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,586
# Win!

690
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:42,674
(DOOR THAT OPENS)
How did it go?

691
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,638
Do one thing: just ask your father.

692
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:47,840
Oh, oh...

693
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:52,104
- I'm sorry, Jerry.
I made you look bad. - No. ..

694
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:55,555
You should have seen his face.
Did you know that was terrible.

695
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,647
It was not terrible, I swear.

696
00:52:57,693 --> 00:53:01,643
Ok, if it was at La Scala, the
would shoot fruits and vegetables.

697
00:53:01,697 --> 00:53:04,698
But that was a cold
recording studio.

698
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:09,368
Images that his voice is better than it actually is
...

699
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,248
... Because you're looking for an excuse not to do the pensioner
.

700
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,576
Do not psychoanalyze me, okay?

701
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:18,628
You know that many have tried, all have failed
.

702
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:23,380
My brain does not fit the usual
Id, Ego and Superego.

703
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:26,629
No, you're the only brain with three Eg

704
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:30,629
- If we eat something, we feel
definitely better. - I'm not hungry.

705
00:53:30,683 --> 00:53:32,675
That was stupid idea I know.

706
00:53:32,727 --> 00:53:36,594
Your father is an adult and is capable of
make his own decisions.

707
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:41,605
Do not know why you came there.
Were you there with the face of those who disapprove.

708
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:45,068
You looked sour.
Maybe you have made your father nervous.

709
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:47,272
I came because he is a simple one.

710
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:50,574
I did not send him alone into a den of sharks
music industry.

711
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,486
- (Jerry) Lair of sharks!
- Do you think my father is a shark?

712
00:53:54,539 --> 00:54:01,288
I have compared it to a spineless jellyfish
, but nothing more.

713
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:05,205
You defend your father.
This is your family and you'll understand.

714
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:08,876
- But he was wrong. - No, I
defend one because you're wrong.

715
00:54:08,928 --> 00:54:11,419
It is not a fault
groped to make something and fail.

716
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:13,548
I do not want to say anything, but
I told you so.

717
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:19,305
Choose  projects destined to fail.
It seems that you try to fail taste.

718
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:22,854
Which projects would have chosen that were doomed to fail?

719
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,735
"Rigoletto" with singers
clothes from white mice.

(GIANCARLO SINGS IN THE SHOWER PERFECTLY
)

00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:33,783
Do you feel it? It is not an amazing voice?

722
00:54:33,827 --> 00:54:37,326
Sure, but what's the point if
unable to sing only in the shower?

723

Be ', however, admit that...

724
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:45,535
He's right, Jerry.
All sing well in the shower.

725
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:51,795
Yes, it's true... He does it in the shower...

Daddy,
even you sing in the shower.

under a hot shower I look like a tenor.

In psychoanalysis there is a term for this.

732
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:18,245
I'm having a revelation and...
Epiphany.

733
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:21,827
- What is the term for what
I'm having? - Desire for death.

734
00:55:22,207 --> 00:55:24,283
(Yell indistinct)

735
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:29,577
Bravo, you were fantastic. Come, let me introduce
a fan of yours unleashed.

736
00:55:29,631 --> 00:55:33,462
- Have you seen all your movies.
Milly, right? - Yes, Milly.

737
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:39,265
- Hi. - I'm sorry.
- So you're one of my fans. - Yes

738
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:44,140

- So I'm flattered, go.

739
00:55:44,186 --> 00:55:48,932
- No, it's true. - Yes? -
I believe that she is an amazing actor.

740
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:55,021
When ratted Arab or
terrorist or divorced father...

741
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:58,690
- I always dreamed of being able to know
. - We have lunch together?

742
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:05,456
- What? You and I! - Eh.
- Together? - I only have an hour.

743
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:09,745
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

744
00:56:09,794 --> 00:56:15,001
She is the sexiest man in Rome,
second World Film. Did you know?

745
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:17,172
Yes, they told me.

746
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:19,211
- Shall we?
- Yes

747
00:56:21,013 --> 00:56:23,006
Thank you.

748
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:27,970
- You think you have so many children?
- No, child, no.

749
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,481
You become their slave.
Diapers, schools, diseases...

750
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:36,818
- Then they grow, they go
and do not see them anymore. - It is not so.

751
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:40,562
For me it was so.
I did not see the time running away from home.

752
00:56:40,616 --> 00:56:45,657
My father was a drug dealer and stole my mother in stores.

753
00:56:45,704 --> 00:56:49,452
(Anna) What could I do?
Was not I right?

754
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:57,210
(Yell indistinct)

755
00:56:57,257 --> 00:57:00,257
- Look!
- He's a great actor.

756
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:06,719
- There is this actor: Luchino Salta.
- Where? - Yes, that's him.

757
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:09,767
(Aunt Rita) But he's married.
Who's that with him?

758
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:15,265
What's up? What is it?

759
00:57:16,108 --> 00:57:18,101
I'm fine, I'm fine.

760
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:23,861
I can not believe you are here
to lunch with her.

761
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,442
What am I lucky, you know?
I'd be eating alone now.

762
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:31,326
No! But how alone! She is married,
there is written all over the papers.

763
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:36,367
(Luke) Marriage is like wine:
it is a wonder if it is good, if not...

764
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,498
We split up. The press does not know
still a secret.

765
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,551
Course.
No, I would not say nothing, for charity.

766
00:57:46,304 --> 00:57:52,424
- What do they do? -
He ​​looks into her eyes. He wants to tow.

767
00:57:53,894 --> 00:58:00,146
I wish you'd stop looking at me on the set
afternoon.

768
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:04,403
So can you give me your instructions,
can you tell me what you think...

769
00:58:04,446 --> 00:58:08,195
Then, perhaps,
let's go to my hotel to talk about it.

770
00:58:09,326 --> 00:58:12,327
Because, interested in my ideas!

771
00:58:12,996 --> 00:58:17,243
- Well, 'but there is something to the contrary?
- No, no. - Ah. - No, absolutely

772
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:21,455
Is that Anthony, my husband always says
I head in the clouds.

773
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:24,375
This, perhaps, a bit 'is true, but...

774
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:26,796
Not serious about your ideas?

775
00:58:26,843 --> 00:58:30,461
No, take it seriously, respect them, but
in science.

776
00:58:30,513 --> 00:58:33,846
Yes, because I am a teacher of high school
. I teach astronomy.

777
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:36,465
- But think!
- Yes

778
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:41,440
So I doubt that interest
my ideas in the arts.

779
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,939
Astronomy, then the sky,
the planets, the stars...

780
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:48,686
- You're... you are... Wait, I do not mean
. - I say nothing, for charity.

781
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:53,946
- Are you a scale.
- No, I'm Sagittarius. - Oh...

782
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:55,986
He took my hand.

783
00:58:57,247 --> 00:59:03,250
- You should give him a slap.
- No, actually, I'm sure she likes.

784
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:11,085
(Splash and yell indistinct)

785
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:14,632
- (Giovanna) Are you hurt?
- No. .. not.

786
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:19,011
Good morning. We are home of Mr. Leopoldo
Pisanello.

787
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,887
I'm half past seven, and Mr.

788
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:29,775
... an event that we document in

789
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,070
Mr. Pisanello you are doing your hair.

790
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:37,658
- Look, just a trim.
- She opted for a trim.

- No, Mr. Pisanello. - Be '?
- Please, this way.

796
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:09,021
- What a shame! - What ways are!
- How dare you!

797
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:11,522
We are old customers!
There will come again!

798
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:15,269
- Are they right. Were lined
before us. - Nonsense.

799
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:17,315
Please, this way. Come in.

I saw you in the office and I could not resist.

- My best friend.

805
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:40,336
I promised her I'd do
love with her after me.

806
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:43,424
This will be one of the happiest days of his life
.

807
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:46,475
You know, he cares
because he is married.

808
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:52,973
Mr. Pisanello, for her
rules do not count. She is special.

809
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,811
Yes, I agree with you completely.

810
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:03,616
- When I read "The Myth of Sisyphus",
my life has changed. - Yes.

811
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,195

- Her pain becomes your. - No
Rilke is your favorite author?

814
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:19,755
Oh, Rilke!
"You must change your life."

815
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:25,554
- Or maybe it's Ezra Pound?
- "Petals on a wet black bough."

816
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:29,298
But the feeling? Do you know a line of each
poet, just enough to pretend.

817
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,352
I got an idea is great.

818
01:01:32,396 --> 01:01:36,892

It's very interesting how choice of words.

877
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:58,966
You are retired, and involving the board to death.

878
01:07:59,018 --> 01:08:02,517
He is in the funeral home.
Puts people in the chest.

879
01:08:02,563 --> 01:08:04,971
While you want to beat the drum.

880
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:09,152
- Is true. - If you are in contact with
Freud, facts give my money.

881
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:13,026
But what  "Pagliacci"! But what
start! Which airplane!

882
01:08:13,073 --> 01:08:17,652
- Where do you want to take my husband!
- She is a perfect Traviata.

883
01:08:17,703 --> 01:08:21,747
- This is crazy! - I assure you...
- What does it say?! - Do not listen to her.

884
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:26,037
We already took away his son
and now wants to take away you too!

885
01:08:26,086 --> 01:08:29,918
- Become a real star. -
But you can not sing! - It is not true!

886
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:32,008
- I do not know how to sing!
- I got it.

887
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:37,013
- Sings only in the shower. - Yes, I know
. - He can not sing. - I got it.

888
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:40,761
- Enough, enough... - I'll kill him, so I
I raise my thought.

889
01:08:40,808 --> 01:08:45,553
Act as a shield! You probably do not
stabs a woman.

890
01:08:45,605 --> 01:08:49,816
- Come on, come on, like that. Calm down...
- Good... - Relax. - What?

891
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,028
It has an aggressive-depressed syndrome.
Lay the knife.

892
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,484
- Stay calm. -
And this should be our mother-in-law?

893
01:08:56,949 --> 01:08:59,025
(Yell indistinct)
We want to introduce people.

894
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:02,030
Mr. Massucci
delegate is the administrator of your company.

895
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,652
Has organized this festival to welcome you.

896
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:11,040
Is an opportunity to learn about the
crème of the business community in Rome.

897
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:15,002
We spoke very highly of you
and are eager to meet you.

898
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:19,925
- It would be nice to make a good impression even on
wives. - Yes

899
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:23,803
- Do not drink so much, honey.
- It is better that I take a coffee.

900
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:27,053
- Does anybody want?
- (Giovanna) No. - Coffee? - No.

901
01:09:27,103 --> 01:09:30,554
Look who's there! Here it is, come on,
I want to introduce my nephew.

902
01:09:30,606 --> 01:09:34,390
- Good morning! Thank you. Beautiful
party. - Meet Antonio.

903
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:40,113
Pleasure. She is the famous nephew.
I have heard great things about her.

904
01:09:40,157 --> 01:09:43,692
Say it is perfect for the image of our society.

905
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:46,863
The image is very important for us.

906
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:50,614
- Do you follow football?
- No.

907
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:58,383
- But are you?
- Yes

908
01:09:58,425 --> 01:10:01,876
- What are you doing here, Anna?
- Milly!

909
01:10:01,928 --> 01:10:04,097
My wife.

910
01:10:04,097 --> 01:10:09,173
- Hello, how are you? - Well, thank you.
- Pleasure. - All my. - Milly.

911
01:10:09,227 --> 01:10:14,268
- We go. - Yes - We're sorry.
- Hello. Coffee? Thank you.

912
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,812
With milk, please.

913
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:25,525
- Anna!
- Hello!

914
01:10:25,576 --> 01:10:29,573
- Milly. - Since when?
- I'm Milly. - Ok.

915
01:10:29,621 --> 01:10:33,619
- There is my wife.
- Do not worry, do not worry.

916
01:10:34,668 --> 01:10:40,504
- I was just calling. That
How about Tuesday? - Usual hours?

917
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:43,122
- Anna!
- Oh!

918
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:47,470
- Oh, Lady! Hello.
I did not expect to meet you here. - Here are Milly.

919
01:10:47,513 --> 01:10:49,589
Ah, Milly? Anyways, 'Milly.

920
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,009
Can you pass me by tomorrow
in office about three?

921
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,219
- I do not know, I have no agenda here.
- I get it.

922
01:10:55,271 --> 01:10:57,263
If you do not feel it, you'll look at three.

923
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:01,644
- I recommend the black bra...
- Yes - The thong, that... - Yes

924
01:11:01,694 --> 01:11:04,944
- But sailing goes there.
- No.

925
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:07,989
- Er... hunting?
- No.

926
01:11:09,284 --> 01:11:13,661
- Anna, how are you? - How are you all right!
- Milly. Milly, Milly.

927
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:18,865
I'm nervous!
I can not afford to make a fool of yourself.

928
01:11:18,919 --> 01:11:22,204
-
Are the most important men in Rome. - Yes, the crème.

929
01:11:22,255 --> 01:11:26,176
- This is the list of my clients
full. - I'm so nervous...

930
01:11:26,176 --> 01:11:30,043
You're too tense, my friend.
Relax or you are a heart attack.

931
01:11:30,096 --> 01:11:33,050
How do I relax, if my
life is falling apart!

932
01:11:33,099 --> 01:11:36,266
How does your wife put up with you if
're always so nervous?

933
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,517
Because he loves me for who I am.

934
01:11:38,563 --> 01:11:43,557
- This is sbaciucchiava
Luchino... what's it called? - Salta.

935
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:45,685
- Why, sbaciucchiavano!
- Pretty much.

936
01:11:45,736 --> 01:11:48,108
You said that you only held hands.

937
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:51,026
There must be an explanation, because for me
Milly is like Madonna.

938
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:56,282
The explanation is simple: he is a
movie star, a sex symbol.

939
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:59,496
And Milly is beautiful and has never looked
another man.

940
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,162
But you women do not know their own.

941
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:06,422
Especially those who have a
hysterical husband who fears his own shadow.

942
01:12:06,464 --> 01:12:11,043
What the hell had to smooch?
If he ate with his eyes.

943
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:14,379
You're probably not able to eat a woman with eyes.

944
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:19,637
One that makes your job
I look like a middle-class idiot.

945
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:22,805
Your wife was a virgin when you married?

946
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:27,232
- None of your business.
- I bet yes.

947
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:32,234
- We did wild things together.
- What do you mean by "wild things"?

948
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,273
Having sex with the lights on?

949
01:12:34,324 --> 01:12:39,117
Believe me, I was not a virgin.
I was a virgin.

950
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:45,788
- You need a lesson!
- By whom? Certainly not from you.

951
01:12:45,836 --> 01:12:50,296
And why not?
So everything is already paid for. It's Free.

952
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,341
- There are people.
- I do not see anyone.

953
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:04,270
- Do not make me forget the carrots.
- Ok. - Do you need all that dough?

954
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:08,137
- Yes, even more. - More!
Not cook for all Trastevere!

955
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:11,855
- (Monica) Tomatoes. - Ok. -
Who had the idea for this business?

956
01:13:11,902 --> 01:13:14,572
It was Monica.
We decided to have dinner together.

957
01:13:14,613 --> 01:13:18,777
And since Leonardo worked and Sally has
lesson, we'll cook.

958
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:22,287
- Can I make a prediction?
- Which one? - You do not know how to cook.

959
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:27,827
- There are things that can cook.
- What? - The chocolate brownies.

960
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:31,624
- The brownies. - Yes - And you shall eat
as the main course? - Yes

961
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:33,664
I find it funny.

962
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:40,429
Do you think we need more wine?
The Italians cook with a lot of wine.

963
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:45,264
- There is already a lot of wine and feels.
- Or maybe the French. - No, ok.

964
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:47,717
- I do not want to be too light.
- Definitely not.

965
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,771
- I can try?
- Yeah, I figured.

966
01:13:51,315 --> 01:13:54,898
I think is...
I'll have some more wine.

967
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:58,313
- More! Are you sure?
We have already done this! - Er... - Ok.

968
01:13:58,364 --> 01:14:01,115
We have to prepare the brownies.
You will know how to do?

969
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:04,242
- I! Did you tell them that you know you do!
- Yes, no, of course...

970
01:14:04,286 --> 01:14:07,073
Only that I left the recipe
in Los Angeles.

971
01:14:07,122 --> 01:14:09,993
But I make them by heart.
I'm sure you know how to do it by heart.

972
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:14,917
Want
we order at the restaurant and say that we cooked us?

973
01:14:14,963 --> 01:14:18,961
- Be '... Expected to taste the sauce.
- Yes, now the taste too.

974
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:21,334
What do you want, penne or rigatoni?

975
01:14:21,386 --> 01:14:25,633
- Do not throw the dough now.
Will arrive in three hours. - Ok.

976
01:14:25,682 --> 01:14:28,255
- What? - I think I'm drunk.
- Really? - Yes.

977
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:31,144
- Then imbrogliamoli.
- Yes, I'm done with the sauce. - Good, ok.

978
01:14:31,187 --> 01:14:35,813
- I'm done with the kitchen. - Ok. -
But I promised to cook dinner.

979
01:14:35,858 --> 01:14:39,274
Yes, I'm glad it worked
between you and Leonardo.

980
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,068
Seriously, why am I
I have put together.

981
01:14:43,115 --> 01:14:48,109
- Yeah, I mean, he... is cute.
- Sexy, you said Sally.

982
01:14:55,293 --> 01:14:59,338
Look... now it's the wine talking.

983
01:15:00,298 --> 01:15:06,217
It is a very spiritual, okay?
It is not... is not one that suffers.

984
01:15:06,262 --> 01:15:09,512
What there is of interest in suffering?

985
01:15:09,557 --> 01:15:14,433
There is something attractive in a man
sensitive to the agony of existence.

986
01:15:18,316 --> 01:15:23,606
God, you... 'd be perfect as
Miss Julie. Strindberg, you know?

987
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:26,857
The tactics of Miss Julie:
I learned as a theater director.

988
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:31,320
'
an actress who would be perfect as Miss Julie and she will be yours.

989
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:34,454
I'm surprised that you say that.

990
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:40,915
Miss Julie
is the role for which I was born. She is me!

991
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:47,166
- How do you know? - I
I have a question not related to you now.

992
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:51,880
- I mean?
- As if you'd take the kiss?

993
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:56,426
Oh... uh...

994
01:15:57,353 --> 01:16:00,769
- Yeah, it is not inherent.
- Oh, the girl is shocked!

995
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:04,682
But just two minutes ago you are putting in your mouth
a tic-tac. Why do you think?

996
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,985
I mean, really, that...
What would you say?

997
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:12,366
I would say that living with my best friend.

998
01:16:12,409 --> 01:16:17,237
Yes, this is true, I just...
I can not stop.

999
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:25,837
- No! Not good!
- Is not you like it?

1000
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,415
No, absolutely...
That's what... wrong.

1001
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:32,468
You?
You think you recover that?

1002
01:16:32,512 --> 01:16:36,379
No, she is perfect.
It's too good to be true.

1003
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:41,178
If something is too good to be true
, of course not.

1004
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,221
I have to have.

1005
01:16:48,944 --> 01:16:53,191
No. .. But now we do, Jack?

1006
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,443
're Playing.
What is a show?

1007
01:16:56,493 --> 01:16:59,163
I can not do this to Sally
in his house.

1008
01:16:59,204 --> 01:17:05,207
- But no, quiet, Sally does not come back.
- No, I mean... - What?

1009
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:09,415
- I do not want to do here.
- What are all these stories!

1010
01:17:09,464 --> 01:17:11,836
If you have to fuck the boy
your best friend's...

1011
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:14,041
... What does it matter where the seat is
?

1012
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:17,462
- You'll never understand women do not!
- More than demonstrated.

1013
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:20,882
This will never become an affair behind
behind Sally, okay?

1014
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:25,180
Today is a rainy afternoon,
I'm a little drunk...

1015
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:31,527
Yes, I feel excited by you, but...
You know, not here, not in his house.

1016
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:36,865
Ok, it is not the time to discuss now
. Come on, let's go in the car.

1017
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:40,905
Be ', then it is different.
I can fuck in the car, fine by me.

1018
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,252
(Man) Smile! Smile!

1019
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:54,546
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1020
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,963
My God, you can not!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1021
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,086
is my cousin!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1022
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:03,300
We met by chance.
I do not have anything to declare, nothing. Come on.

1023
01:18:03,349 --> 01:18:05,887
Nothing, nothing! Please...
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1024
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:09,138
(indistinct and yell excitedly)
We met by chance!

1025
01:18:09,188 --> 01:18:12,308
I was waiting for my wife.
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1026
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:21,314
(indistinct and yell excitedly)

1027
01:18:23,202 --> 01:18:29,322
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1028
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:32,790
Have some respect at least of the procession.

1029
01:18:41,594 --> 01:18:46,137
Roberto, do not take it anymore.
But why me, Roberto?

1030
01:18:46,182 --> 01:18:50,760
- What's going on?
- Sir, you must resign.

1031
01:18:50,812 --> 01:18:55,141
- She is a very, very famous
. - But why?!

1032
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:59,520
- Look at this, the pills...
This morning was full. - Ah. - Mamma Mia!

1033
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:06,106
- Why are they famous? - Why?
She is famous for being famous.

1034
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,911
But I have not done anything, Roberto.

1035
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:14,707
Excuse me, but, according to her, all those who are famous
deserve it?

1036
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:18,001
I do not know! You see that you
I ask an opinion?!

1037
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:21,082
All asking for my opinion.
I do not know!

1038
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:24,169
All I ask questions.
My life is a living hell!

1039
01:19:24,219 --> 01:19:27,385
A journalist asked me two days ago if there is God

1040
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,802
I said, "What do I know? I do not know"
and she is upset.

1041
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:33,847
"Mr. Pisanello not know if there is
God" "But I do not know, do not you know!"

1042
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:36,564
Everyone asks me things...
"Pisanello"

1043
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:39,809
"How do you scratch your head?
With the right or the left?"

1044
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,898
"With both of us."
"Oh, if the scratch with both!"

1045
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:46,024
They are made private! I scratch my head
me with the hand that I think.

1046
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:52,241
- It is private! - The way I see it,
I do not agree with her.

1047
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:57,744
Being a celebrity,
excitement, special privileges...

1048
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:02,704
... The adoring crowds who want his autograph
, never make a row...

1049
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:06,456
Women! But you do not know...
I love it! They kneel!

1050
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:09,344
"Ah, Pisanello! How beautiful!
She is beautiful!"

1051
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:12,507
They want to be in bed all
with me... in three, four...

1052
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,549
I already have my problems in two...

1053
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,428
The wife of a man of his caliber
knows he has to share it with the public.

1054
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,018
Normality...
No interrupt me...

1055
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:25,766
A dialogue without being interrupted...
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1056
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,771
Enough!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1057
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:32,697
Take me home! Enough!
Report you for violation of privacy!

1058
01:20:32,743 --> 01:20:36,076
You are heartless!
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1059
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:40,364
Bravo!
You're better than what I had imagined.

1060
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:44,201
- Why are you so quiet?
- Because I have committed adultery.

1061
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:47,006
Consider it part of your training.

1062
01:20:47,048 --> 01:20:49,718
Some things I've never done.

1063
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:54,463
- Why not? - Why Milly
I would be upset.

1064
01:20:54,514 --> 01:20:58,974
But with me you have not had any problems.
Because I'm a prostitute?

1065
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:03,146
With you I felt uninhibited.
But now I feel guilty.

1066
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:06,474
Milly would not commit adultery
and I never betray.

1067
01:21:06,525 --> 01:21:08,648
Maybe you do not mind knowing that you have learned something.

1068
01:21:08,694 --> 01:21:12,692
Some things I can do with
Milly, it's like a saint.

1069
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:17,236
Yes, like Madonna.
Here the saint you are mica Milly.

1070
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:21,153
Virgin at the wedding you've come to you and not her.

1071
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:32,337
- Like this?
- It's beautiful here!

1072
01:21:32,384 --> 01:21:35,835
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks, I can not.

1073
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:39,256
But why not?

1074
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,884
- Here.
- Thank you.

1075
01:21:46,564 --> 01:21:50,514
I love the old songs,
those of my childhood.

1076
01:21:50,568 --> 01:21:55,111
- I am very beautiful.
- And even as they danced once.

1077
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:57,732
Eh, yes?

1078
01:21:59,368 --> 01:22:04,706
- Eh? - You are very good.
- Yes, what do you...

1079
01:22:07,459 --> 01:22:09,617
Ma ..  did not want to talk about?

1080
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:14,830
- Nostalgia is my weakness.
- The memories are beautiful.

1081
01:22:16,885 --> 01:22:19,423
Did he ever tell someone
that you're beautiful?

1082
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:26,434
It is not true, no. My husband, maybe a
time, but a movie actor ever.

1083
01:22:26,477 --> 01:22:30,475
Please do not take me for an actor,
are a human being like others...

1084
01:22:30,523 --> 01:22:35,101
... The same feelings, the same
vulnerability, the same desires.

1085
01:22:35,152 --> 01:22:41,107
I'm sorry...
when you kiss those beautiful women in the cinema...

1086
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:45,487
... You seem to me, as I'll explain...
A crazy man.

1087
01:22:45,537 --> 01:22:49,617
A kiss is just fiction film.

1088
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:53,616
Yes, I know, but I've always wondered
...

1089
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:58,332
... I wonder what it would be
Luke kissing Salta.

1090
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:03,384
Now you know.

1091
01:23:04,305 --> 01:23:08,006
- It's fantastic. - I'm beautiful?
- No, more.

1092
01:23:08,059 --> 01:23:11,807
- Wait now comes the rest.
- What else?

1093
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:13,930
Well ', we do. At this point I
I can not go back.

1094
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:21,312
- You're charming.
- No, no, no, no. What a mess!

1095
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:25,147
- I do not see any trouble.
- Yes that is a problem.

1096
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,735
I would love to make love with you...

1097
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:32,536
... So I could tell my grandchildren something to
, but should commit adultery.

1098
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,575
Forget the semantics...

1099
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:39,288
I love you all.

1100
01:23:39,339 --> 01:23:44,333
My Lady, I do not know what to do.
I do not know what to do.

1101
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:49,297
I love my husband, but I am so curious
.

1102
01:23:49,349 --> 01:23:53,512
Life is so short, there are certain moments
already written in destiny.

1103
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:59,895
- One is this. - No, wait.
Wait a moment please go to the bathroom.

1104
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:04,154
Do not move, do not move from there.
Do not go.

1105
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,845
- What is it?
- I swore that I would.

1106
01:24:29,888 --> 01:24:34,799
I know. Me neither.
I have to tell Sally.

1107
01:24:34,851 --> 01:24:39,513
But you said that your relationship
was dying, not my fault.

1108
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:42,055
Do not say that, it is already off.

1109
01:24:45,778 --> 01:24:52,361
- Do you know... Yesterday I dreamed
of the two of us together. - Really?

1110
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,411
To explore Italy...

1111
01:24:56,455 --> 01:25:02,540
... To see the beautiful architecture
Milan, Venice, Naples.

1112
01:25:03,962 --> 01:25:07,794
- I'll be master?
- I'm a good teacher?

1113
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:15,049
We could be... in small towns...

1114
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:18,182
... In boarding houses.

1115
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:21,476
Since Sally has a week
exams...

1116
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:23,981
First... I do not want to give her the news.

1117
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:28,442
- No, of course.
- But soon after. I love you.

1118
01:25:38,912 --> 01:25:44,333
(Yell indistinct)

1119
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:46,993
Okay. Yes
(yell indistinct)

1120
01:25:51,925 --> 01:25:54,712
But who is that?
Seems interesting!

1121
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:59,719
(Indistinct and yell excitedly)

1122
01:25:59,766 --> 01:26:03,550
We're on the road with Aldo Romano. E '
is true that a bus driver?

1123
01:26:03,603 --> 01:26:05,891
What do you want, I do not understand?

1124
01:26:05,938 --> 01:26:09,603
- It is true that
is bringing the clothes in the laundry? - Yes, but what do you want?

1125
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,936
- Do you like the hamburger?
- No, I do not like.

1126
01:26:12,987 --> 01:26:16,403
- It is a stain on his jacket?
- Yes, it's marinara sauce.

1127
01:26:16,448 --> 01:26:19,948
- As if procured?
- But I have to tell everyone?

1128
01:26:19,994 --> 01:26:25,236
E'successo while I ate a plate of rigatoni. What interests you?

1129
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:45,059
- Gabriel, Camilla, Sofia.
- Hello, Dad! - Hello! - Hello!

1130
01:26:45,059 --> 01:26:47,811
You know it is all over?

1131
01:26:47,854 --> 01:26:51,104
It's back to business as usual,
I'm happy.

1132
01:26:51,148 --> 01:26:54,019
Now Aldo Romano is all over the news.

1133
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:59,442
Perfesteggiare go to eat a pizza in Velletri. I'm buying.

1134
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:02,280
- Who is it?
- Aldo Romano.

1135
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:07,914
- I think I went well
exam. - Of course!

1136
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:10,743
You got it passed with ease,
've studied much.

1137
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:14,493
- I have tried so hard.
- Doubt itself for no reason.

1138
01:27:14,546 --> 01:27:17,582
- Do you want anything else?
- Sure. - No. - No.

1139
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:23,089
- Ah, okay, so...
- Ok.

1140
01:27:25,682 --> 01:27:30,758
See how quiet?
The harbor for dinner tonight and tell him.

1141
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:33,018
- Ok. Are you sure?
- Yes Yes.

1142
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:36,848
I thought of a very beautiful:
I have not ever seen the Acropolis and the Parthenon.

1143
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:38,775
Can we go to Sicily.

1144
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:42,319
In fact we could rent a boat to sail and go around the boot.

1145
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:45,982
I have always seen pictures of Palermo and I think it's romantic.

1146
01:27:46,035 --> 01:27:50,032
Nothing compared to being on the spot.
(PHONE RINGING)

1147
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:55,501
- I'm sorry.
- Sure. Hello? No. .. Hello?

1148
01:27:55,544 --> 01:27:59,493
Yes, let me see if I can...
Hello?

1149
01:28:03,843 --> 01:28:06,963
- E'triste.
- What?

1150
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,551
That you in love with Monica.

1151
01:28:09,599 --> 01:28:13,134
- There's something about her...
- Did you know that Sally loves you very much?

1152
01:28:13,186 --> 01:28:18,262
- I know. - And your common sense tells you that
Sally is a more sensible choice.

1153
01:28:18,316 --> 01:28:24,069
Yes, I know, I know everything, but still...
I can not explain.

1154
01:28:24,113 --> 01:28:25,821
I see.

1155
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:29,198
- Guess what '? - What?
- I had a part. - A part?

1156
01:28:29,243 --> 01:28:32,078
A beautiful part in a film with a big budget...

1157
01:28:32,121 --> 01:28:34,243
... Turns to Los Angeles and Tokyo.

1158
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:38,785
- When? - I have to leave tonight.
- What were you saying the boat in Sicily?

1159
01:28:38,835 --> 01:28:42,418
- They need me for five months.
- Five months in Japan?

1160
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:46,793
A month in Los Angeles and four in Japan
, if consistent with the times.

1161
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:49,179
I can not wait to go.

1162
01:28:49,179 --> 01:28:52,797
It is the dream of my life
to go in the Far East.

1163
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:54,676
- It's your dream?
- Who's there?

1164
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:57,299
Justin Brill, Ricardo Ramirez...

1165
01:28:57,353 --> 01:28:59,512
Ricardo Ramirez is very charming.

1166
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:03,192
I worked with Justin Brill
when he was married to Rebecca Wright.

1167
01:29:03,192 --> 01:29:07,735
- The boy picked up a
crazy crush on me. - Now it is free.

1168
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:11,647
It's all so exciting!
I can not wait to get back to Los Angeles.

1169
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,740
See the drama teacher...

1170
01:29:13,786 --> 01:29:16,656
It's nice to see places,
but nothing is like home.

1171
01:29:16,705 --> 01:29:19,030
- Who is the director?
- Max Trommel.

1172
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:22,083
I love it, I love his work.

1173
01:29:22,127 --> 01:29:26,753
Is the only one I trust to turn
of the nudity required.

1174
01:29:26,798 --> 01:29:31,377
Even though I know that a lot of drugs,
look so worn out...

1175
01:29:31,428 --> 01:29:34,464
... Is so sexy about him.

1176
01:29:36,224 --> 01:29:38,797
I have to lose weight.

1177
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:44,391
The writer saw me on TV and
lost his head for my skill.

1178
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:48,390
I have to lose three pounds.
I'll start to run.

1179
01:29:48,444 --> 01:29:52,821
This part is such an occasion for me...

1180
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:58,359
I hope I can bring my dog, not
as in London which is impossible.

1181
01:29:59,288 --> 01:30:01,411
Milly Stay calm, stay calm.

1182
01:30:01,457 --> 01:30:04,327
Better to go to bed and have a regret...

1183
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:08,290
... Or just go and have a
regret for life?

1184
01:30:08,338 --> 01:30:12,336
What do I do? Better remorse, no?

1185
01:30:12,384 --> 01:30:16,547
Better remorse, absolutely.

1186
01:30:21,643 --> 01:30:27,515
- Yes, better remorse. - Shut up.
- What? - Shut up or I'll kill you.

1187
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:34,946
Now open the door and let's go, hurry
. Not a word.

1188
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,238
- Are you ready love? - Shut
and not even open your mouth.

1189
01:30:40,286 --> 01:30:44,200
If you do what I say
there'll be okay.

1190
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:48,245
- Got it? - Yes
- Then give me the money and jewelry.

1191
01:30:48,293 --> 01:30:53,667
- You are who I am? - No, I do not know
and I do not give a damn.

1192
01:30:55,008 --> 01:30:57,581
- You shut up and stop crying.
- Here.

1193
01:30:57,636 --> 01:31:02,381
- Give me your wallet.
- But does not rise.

1194
01:31:02,432 --> 01:31:06,346
- Give me your watch. - Yes
- The clock. - Yes

1195
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,885
(SHOTS AT THE DOOR)
(Man) Open.

1196
01:31:08,938 --> 01:31:13,896

1198
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:20,905
- My wife! She is my wife.
- Your wife? - Yes

1199
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:24,449
- But you were separated?
- Oh, the food!

1200
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:28,332
- I do not want to end up like the other woman
in the paper. - I'm finished.

1201
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:30,704
(SHOTS AT THE DOOR)
Oh...

1202
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,535
Listen to me.
Let's do this... Not yet finished.

1203
01:31:34,588 --> 01:31:38,253
Let's do this. You put yourself in
to the bathroom and hide in the shower.

1204
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,965
- I put her in bed.
- Yes - Go and shut the door.

1205
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:46,258
- Join. - Yes, good.
- Close. Go to bed.

1206
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,342
(SHOTS AT THE DOOR)
(Man) Open up!

1207
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:55,389
- Now this gentleman, I must explain why he did not open
. - Come on.

1208
01:31:55,441 --> 01:31:58,228
- (Woman) Come near the bed.
- Did not you hear knocking?

1209
01:31:58,277 --> 01:32:02,524
- What's going on? Are you crazy?
- Have not you heard?

1210
01:32:02,573 --> 01:32:06,440
But I need to hear? I'm
here with my girlfriend and I was...

1211
01:32:06,493 --> 01:32:08,652
But she is not the woman's husband?

1212
01:32:08,704 --> 01:32:12,037
- But who knows!
- She said it was her husband.

1213
01:32:12,082 --> 01:32:15,783
But you're crazy! I will sue you!

1214
01:32:15,836 --> 01:32:18,790
Please forgive us and please excuse us.
What have you done?

1215
01:32:18,839 --> 01:32:25,090
I do not understand what is happening.
(Yell indistinct)

1216
01:32:25,136 --> 01:32:27,462
- It was not my fault.
- Exit.

1217
01:32:27,514 --> 01:32:31,381
- Look, that was not my fault.
- Madam, be patient!

1218
01:32:31,434 --> 01:32:37,270
- I'm sorry. - (Thief) I call
lawyers. - Sorry.

1219
01:32:37,648 --> 01:32:41,402
- Anyway, I...
- Come, madam. Thank you.

1220
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:46,942
- Did not have to end like this.
I do not know what... - Have a seat, ma'am.

1221
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:52,079
- But...
- Enough!

1222
01:32:53,664 --> 01:32:55,952
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Imagine.

1223
01:32:55,999 --> 01:32:59,664
I take my disorder. Vado.

1224
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:05,547
In fact here is the clock.

1226
01:33:07,969 --> 01:33:12,133
- Thank you very much.
- Hello. Thank you. Hello.

1227
01:33:12,182 --> 01:33:14,589
I can not believe.

1228
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:23,472
Course... right,
're really cute.

1229
01:33:23,526 --> 01:33:27,773
- What?
- He's right, you're pretty.

1230
01:33:27,822 --> 01:33:34,109
Thank you. Ma .. she is a thief, right?

1231
01:33:34,912 --> 01:33:40,119
Yes, I'm a thief specialized in hotels.

1232
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:44,745
- But I also do some mugging.
- Oh yeah?

1233
01:33:44,796 --> 01:33:50,502
- Ah. Exciting.
- You're exciting.

1234
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:58,013
You know I've never made love with a criminal
?

1235
01:33:58,059 --> 01:34:03,219
- My husband is a businessman
very respectable. - Yes? - Yes

1236
01:34:03,272 --> 01:34:10,568
know what they say,
opportunity makes the thief. We take this opportunity?

1237
01:34:10,613 --> 01:34:15,275
- Be '... sure. - Of course.
- We're in a hotel room.

1238
01:34:15,326 --> 01:34:21,280
- We're in bed, you're with the
petticoat. - I'm already dressed.

1239
01:34:21,331 --> 01:34:24,498
- So. - So what?
- So, anyway...

1240
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,263
I think I will feel more Monica.

1241
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:44,883
Yes, but you will read about
tabloid...

1242
01:34:44,937 --> 01:34:49,315
... That comes and goes with Justin Brill
vacationing in Aspen at his chalet.

1243
01:34:49,358 --> 01:34:52,395
Consider yourself lucky.
You saved my life.

1244
01:34:52,445 --> 01:34:56,145
A year with her and you might throw in a free fall...

1245
01:34:56,198 --> 01:34:59,069
... And adopt orphaned Burmese.

1246
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:03,578
- With age comes wisdom.
- With age comes exhaustion.

1247
01:35:03,622 --> 01:35:06,576
-
We have met here the first time. - Yes

1248
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:10,919
- Now I have to go back to the Excelsior.
- Nice. Are you doing well.

1249
01:35:10,963 --> 01:35:16,835
- You make a lot of money with shopping centers
. - Have you sold?

1250
01:35:16,885 --> 01:35:21,262
As a wise man once said:
"Things happen."

1251
01:35:21,306 --> 01:35:25,635
- Sure. So, I salute you.
- Yes, Goodbye.

1252
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:49,368
How nice!

1253
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:55,378
Tonight there is a preview film.

1254
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:58,707
Can we go without
casino and enjoy the film.

1255
01:35:58,758 --> 01:36:02,092
We must not put ourselves posing for journalists.

1256
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:09,602
- Look, we were not invited.
- Ah...

1257
01:36:09,602 --> 01:36:12,722
Then we can stay at home and enjoy the film.

1258
01:36:12,772 --> 01:36:20,150
And I no longer have to share you with
models, actresses and sexy secretaries.

1259
01:36:20,196 --> 01:36:25,190
Ma .. Hey! Hey! Hey!

1260
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,864
I am  Leopoldo Pisanello.

1261
01:36:27,912 --> 01:36:31,115
Good morning, ma'am, this morning I had breakfast...

1262
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:34,368
... I put the butter on two slices of bread and jam
.

1263
01:36:34,418 --> 01:36:36,991
Then I made the cream with the shaving gel
.

1264
01:36:37,045 --> 01:36:41,921
Because I do so the beard,
with gel. I really like the cream.

1265
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:45,964
I am Leopoldo Pisanello.

I give you a scoop: I wear boxers.
Do you want them to see?

1268
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:02,565
Do you want them to see the boxer? Here they are.
I wear white boxers and wide.

1269
01:37:02,612 --> 01:37:05,980
Here they are. It's a scoop!

1270
01:37:06,032 --> 01:37:12,283
Lady! Are Leopoldo Pisanello.
Do you think it's better a trim?

1271
01:37:12,329 --> 01:37:16,541
And she's my wife.
Mrs., look has stretch marks.

1272
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:22,123
The ladder in the stocking is fashionable.
It "trend" the ladder.

1273
01:37:22,172 --> 01:37:27,463
Want to see Pisanello
on one leg alone? Here it is, on one leg.

1274
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:32,089
Is a great scoop,
this morning I had breakfast...

1275
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:38,558
(Leopold) Just paparazzi!
Just paparazzi! Enough!

1276
01:37:38,605 --> 01:37:42,649
- Excuse me, but I know you. - Yes ..
- Yes, I remember the face.

1277
01:37:42,692 --> 01:37:44,731
She was not... What was his name?

1278
01:37:44,777 --> 01:37:48,442
- I Leopoldo Pisanello. - That's it.
- You want an autograph?

1279
01:37:48,489 --> 01:37:54,159
- Yes If you want to... Tenga.
- I'll give you an autograph. - Please.

1280
01:37:54,203 --> 01:37:59,445
- I Leopoldo Pisanello,
if you remember. - Thank you. - It's me.

1281
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:04,245
- You see? - Yes, let's go home,
there are children. - Come on.

1282
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:09,207
Here, here.
He ​​surely remember me.

1283
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:13,553
This gentleman once,
I acted as driver. Right?

1284
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:19,432
- Yes - Here. - I told you:
"Life is sometimes very cruel."

1285
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,763
It does not give satisfaction
nor to those who are rich and famous...

1286
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,305
... Or who is poor and unknown.

1287
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:31,063
But to be rich and famous, between the two,
is definitely better.

1288
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:35,738
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- Thank you. - Lord. - Goodbye.

1289
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:40,204
Come on.

1290
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:45,372
- You know what he said?
- Yes, I understand... I get it.

1291
01:38:54,219 --> 01:39:02,475
- Milly? Milly? - But where are
finished? I was worried.

1292
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:06,599
- What happened to you?
- I went in and I found you.

1293
01:39:06,648 --> 01:39:10,230
Then I lost the phone, I'm lost for
Rome.

1294
01:39:10,276 --> 01:39:12,269
But you do that to you?

1295
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,107
My uncles I have organized every
minutes.

1296
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:18,940
- At least it went well?
- We're going home.

1297
01:39:18,993 --> 01:39:21,566
- As at home?
- Yes, let's go back to Pordenone.

1298
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,621
- But we just got here.
- Does not matter.

1299
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:28,532
I do not want to see my uncles and their friends
jerks.

1300
01:39:28,585 --> 01:39:31,456
I do not want that job.
I want my old job back.

1301
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:34,838
Maybe we will not be rich, but we will have a better life
.

1302
01:39:34,883 --> 01:39:40,553
- Ate always like to teach?
- Yes Yes, but... - No "but".

1303
01:39:40,597 --> 01:39:42,969
We now return home and we will have a life...

1304
01:39:43,016 --> 01:39:48,093
... A life much better,
with children.

1305
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:56,604
I also... I can paint a little. '

1306
