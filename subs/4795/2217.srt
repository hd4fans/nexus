1
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:51,104
500 years ago, Spain was a nation of fear and superstition.

2
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:56,297
The Crown and a merciless lnquisition punished all who dared to dream.

3
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:59,863
A single man defied this power,

4
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,877
crossing the unknown sea in search of honour and gold,

5
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,141
for the Glory of God.

6
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,226
Of all the words my father wrote, and there were many,

7
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,187
l remember these most:

8
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:27,828
"Nothing in human progress is achieved with unanimous consent.

9
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,758
Those enlightened before others"

10
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,907
must pursue that light in spite of others.

11
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,944
There was a time the New World didn't exist.

12
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,406
The sun set in the west, where no man ventured.

13
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,846
And beyond that...

14
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:48,672
infinity!

15
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,748
Look.

16
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,760
Now...

17
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,023
half of the hull has gone.

18
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:57,931
Good.

19
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:01,258
And now?

20
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,690
Now, l only see the mast.

21
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:16,147
Close your eyes. And don't cheat.

22
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:17,910
l'm watching.

23
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,219
Open them when l tell you.

24
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,392
Once l asked my father where he wanted to go.

25
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,154
He replied:

26
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,990
"l want to travel over the seas.

27
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:39,504
l want to get behind the weather."

28
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,570
Now.

29
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,000
lt's gone.

30
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,308
What does it tell you?

31
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:01,422
lt's round,

32
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:02,746
like this.

33
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,254
Round.

34
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,634
Come on, lad.

35
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:36,446
Good morning, Father.

36
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,427
Diego!

37
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,876
Kiss your brother, Diego.

38
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:19,927
l have something for you.

39
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,704
You'll be heard at Salamanca University.

40
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:29,875
ln a week!

41
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,783
That's what it says.

42
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,792
How did you manage it?

43
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,190
With some difficulty.

44
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,162
l promised them you weren't a total fool.

45
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:06,453
Marco Polo said he found Earthly Paradise off the coast of China.

46
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:08,945
Do you believe this?

47
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:14,399
l believe in Paradise and Hell. And l do believe both can be earthly.

48
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,633
Now... let's go through this again.

49
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,866
Why do you wish to sail west?

50
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:27,777
To open a new route to Asia.

51
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:32,709
Asia is the richest Kingdom. The land of spices and gold.

52
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,588
There are two ways of reaching it...

53
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:41,519
By sea... Sailing around the African continent,

54
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:43,730
which takes a year,

55
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:48,287
or by land. But the Turks have closed the route to Christians.

56
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,998
There is a third way...

57
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,200
by sailing west across the sea.

58
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,705
The distance is unknown...

59
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:03,343
lt's said to be infinite.

60
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,852
Superstition!

61
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,197
l believe the lndies

62
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:18,150
are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary lslands.

63
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,694
How can you be so certain?

64
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:25,501
The calculations of Toscanelli... Marin de Tyr...

65
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:27,138
Esdras...            Esdras is a Jew.

66
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,411
So was Christ!            2 minutes...

67
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,371
and already you're a bad man.

68
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:33,571
For telling the truth?            Yes.

69
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,512
They're burning people for less.

70
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,941
The man you're to confront

71
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,350
has no emotions.

72
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:44,416
Learn to control your passion.

73
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,554
Passion is something one can't control.

74
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,224
You need their blessing.

75
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,622
lf they say no...

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,729
you would have to give up.

77
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,835
l will not give up.

78
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,202
ls it ambition?

79
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,904
We've been told lies for so long...

80
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,105
The world is flat like this table...

81
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:10,139
Monsters guard the edge of the world...

82
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:14,143
l will not be told what and what not to be afraid of!

83
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,813
l want to find out for myself.

84
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:23,152
l just hope your passion will be contagious, my son.

85
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:44,830
Look, father!

86
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:53,975
Fernando!

87
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,331
Do you repent your sins

88
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,636
in the name of the Father,

89
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,971
the Son and the Holy Spirit?

90
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,264
Burnings in the square...

91
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:52,362
They agreed to see me in Salamanca.

92
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,001
lf they accept l could be gone for years.

93
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:08,305
l know.

94
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,914
l haven't given you a real life.

95
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:18,554
Uh... that's true, l have a child by a man who won't marry me...

96
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:20,181
Are you going to argue?

97
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:24,456
l'd love to argue with you more often, but you're never here.

98
00:13:56,832 --> 00:14:01,295
Unfortunately, that is precisely where our opinions differ.

99
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,226
You're familiar with Aristotle? Eratosthenes? Ptolemeus?

100
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,301
l am, Your Eminence.

101
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,743
So you can't ignore their calculations that the circumference

102
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:15,945
of the Earth is approximately 22,000 leagues or more...

103
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:18,406
making the ocean uncrossable.

104
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,220
But you...

105
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:25,924
may have found new evidence proving these great men mistaken!

106
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:34,662
You are aware of Marin de Tyr?

107
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,132
We are.

108
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,511
Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus...

109
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:45,704
De Tyr believes the ocean to be only 750 leagues.

110
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:47,852
Toscanelli...

111
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,846
and the French Cardinal D'Ailly, both think De Tyr

112
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,880
is accurate in his calculations.

113
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,654
Therefore the ocean can be crossed.

114
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:01,960
Silence!

115
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:07,132
Gentlemen, are we here to examine this man's proposal, or not?

116
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:10,270
Let's suppose the moment...

117
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:14,337
Marin de Tyr is right. ln your opinion,

118
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,141
how long would it take?

119
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:17,882
Seven weeks.

120
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:19,676
Six, during the summer.

121
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,010
De Tyr is wrong.

122
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,649
He's contradicted by the finest...

123
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,318
geographers.

124
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:30,186
Your voyage, Senor Colombus, would take a year.

125
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,024
Suppose you cross the ocean and reach Asia...

126
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,193
What would Spain do there?

127
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,592
Trade, Your Excellency.

128
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:47,714
According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest lands in the

129
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,676
The meanest buildings are roofed in gold.

130
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,637
lt's your only interest?

131
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,148
Gold?

132
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:57,088
No.

133
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,018
l'll bring these people to God

134
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,219
and make them subjects of Castille and Aragon.

135
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,827
From a Realm,

136
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,162
Spain will become an Empire!

137
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,894
lf God intended our proximity to Asia

138
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:16,639
do you believe he'd have waited for you to show it?

139
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:20,007
He chose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world.

140
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,875
So you consider yourself the Chosen One?

141
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,552
Asia can be found to the west...

142
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:36,919
and l will prove it!

143
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,570
The Treasurer of Spain honours us.

144
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:58,837
The State has an interest in his proposition, Your Eminence.

145
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,247
With all due respect, the judgement is ours.

146
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,509
Why not?

147
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:04,979
And if he were right?

148
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:11,954
l've always found such independent minds dangerous.

149
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,125
lf he had wings he'd return from the skies

150
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,200
and say heaven was empty.

151
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:26,198
l'd deplore the loss of such an opportunity for Spain.

152
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,940
Especially over a point of geography.

153
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,547
lt's not geography. lt's about reality.

154
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,175
This man is a mercenary.

155
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,688
States often use mercenaries.

156
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:41,953
lf it is to the benefit, the stability of Spain... No?

157
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,687
lt should be as much your concern as it is mine.

158
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,152
You would use your influence to assist this heretic?

159
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,164
Well...

160
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,638
You know, your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power...

161
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,631
is that what can be given...

162
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,075
so easily can be taken away.

163
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:32,264
And therefore nothing could justify Your Majesties' participation

164
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:36,143
in a venture that relies on feeble assumptions,

165
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,937
and which any man of knowledge

166
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:43,577
would take to be impractical... if not impossible.

167
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:47,550
They didn't listen. They don't want to listen.

168
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,689
Don't give in. You must wait.            Wait?

169
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:53,921
After seven years, how much longer can l wait?

170
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:55,423
lf God intends you to...

171
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:56,955
Damn God!            Christopher!

172
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:02,461
Damn all of you! You sit concocting theories based on what?

173
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,328
You never leave your gardens. Go out!

174
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:09,197
Well then, tell me something l can accept.

175
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:13,764
These are full of assumptions!

176
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,112
Just lies!

177
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:20,750
All of it lies!

178
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,365
All of it lies!

179
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:52,803
Father?

180
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:55,378
Don't disturb a man

181
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,817
doing penance.

182
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,855
What can you do?

183
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:06,494
Nothing. That's the point, Fernando.

184
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,365
Fernando!

185
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:57,274
Senor Colombus?

186
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:02,122
l've looked all over Sevilla for you.

187
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:04,708
Never expected to find you in a monastery.

188
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,587
l'm Pinzon.

189
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:12,153
Martin Alonzo Pinzon. l'm a ship owner from Palos.

190
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,129
ls he a spy?

191
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,336
What is it? Are you a Trappist?

192
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:30,369
Vow of silence?

193
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:32,277
Penance?

194
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:33,779
Just my luck.

195
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,344
l'll do the talking for us.

196
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,116
Just nod, agreed?

197
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,858
As with my wife.

198
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,413
l know the commission turned you down, right?

199
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,031
What do you expect? You're a foreigner.

200
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,657
And l want to help you.

201
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:51,766
Why do l believe in you? l'm a seaman, too.

202
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:55,133
We don't like to be told where to go or not to go.

203
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:00,264
l don't look much, but l have friends,

204
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,245
important friends.

205
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,038
A banker, for example.

206
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,770
He finances me. He's name is Santangel.

207
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,074
Heard of him?

208
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:11,952
He'll get you in to see the Queen.

209
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:13,694
You know why?

210
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,623
She owes him money. That's for it.

211
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:19,929
You, me, the Queen, the world... Everybody owes something.

212
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:22,286
What do you say?

213
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,664
Where can l meet him?            Here.

214
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:26,999
Right there.

215
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,309
May l ask a question?

216
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:36,946
Yes.

217
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,542
Why do you want to help me?

218
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,505
Faith.

219
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:45,413
Hope.

220
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:47,352
Charity.

221
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:51,982
But greater than all these...

222
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,225
is banking.

223
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:00,488
Wait, Senores!

224
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:06,265
The Moors built Granada centuries ago.

225
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,839
We've taken it back.

226
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:11,666
A tragic victory. We're losing a great culture.

227
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:20,279
But l suppose there's a price for every victory.

228
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:22,312
lsn't there Senor Colombus?

229
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,635
Don Luis de Santangel

230
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,533
to see Don Gabriel Sanchez.

231
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:47,702
Luis!

232
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:02,519
Senor Columbus, Senor Pinzon.

233
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,305
Rise... Come forward.

234
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:56,813
l should not be listening to you since my Council said not to.

235
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:00,243
But Santangel says you're a man of honour...

236
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:03,580
And Sanchez says you're not completely mad.

237
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,783
No more than she who said she would take Granada from the Moors.

238
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:13,131
They believe the ocean is... uncrossable,

239
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,383
Senor Colombus.

240
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,689
What did they say about Granada?

241
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,240
That it was impregnable.

242
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:41,722
l can't ignore my Council's verdict.

243
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:44,882
Surely you can do what you want.

244
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,595
How little you know.

245
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,392
Why should l believe in you, Senor Colombus?

246
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:01,534
May l speak freely?

247
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,547
You are not inclined to speak otherwise.

248
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:05,934
l know what l see.

249
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,948
l see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.

250
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:11,210
Who's not afraid.

251
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,850
l see a woman who thinks...            A woman?

252
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:20,584
Forgive me...

253
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:24,400
but you're the only Queen l know.

254
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,468
That makes us equal, you're the only navigator l know.

255
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:36,569
How old are you, Senor Colombus?

256
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:40,072
Thirty-nine, Your Majesty.

257
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:42,575
And you?

258
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:46,381
l'm forty...

259
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,326
You will be informed of our decision.

260
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:11,604
l thought you were younger than l.

261
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,756
The cost would be ruinous.

262
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,802
No more than the cost of two state banquets.

263
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:44,011
Two banquets, for new lands and spices...

264
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:47,275
and gold.

265
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:49,652
What are you saying, Sanchez?

266
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:54,918
That if he's right we have everything to gain.

267
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:58,119
And if he's wrong...

268
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,185
we've so little to lose.

269
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:25,177
Tell me what he says.

270
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:28,024
He demands to be made a Knight,

271
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:31,016
with the right to wear the Golden Spurs.

272
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:35,292
And that he will receive the title Don Christopher Colombus,

273
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:39,462
which will be extended to his descendants.

274
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,531
What else?

275
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:48,503
He'll be named Admiral of the Ocean Seas.

276
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,713
Viceroy of the West lndies...

277
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:55,020
Governor of all islands or lands discovered,

278
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:58,721
or as will be discovered by him.

279
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,226
The highest titles of nobility, Your Excellency.

280
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:06,594
To an immigrant sheltered by monks!

281
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:15,707
Furthermore...

282
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,272
he'll receive one tenth

283
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:20,170
of wealth or monies,

284
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:21,567
precious gems,

285
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:26,176
pearls, metals, spices and other lucrative sources

286
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,950
acquired under his jurisdiction.

287
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,394
You worry too much, Francisco.

288
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:40,565
He'll have to lower his demands.

289
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,463
Believe me...

290
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,039
He will.

291
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:49,772
l won't!

292
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:54,975
We have considered your proposal carefully. lt is excessive.

293
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,843
The responsibility is excessive.

294
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,147
Consider the contract...            No.

295
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:02,723
No?            No.

296
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,394
And l thought he was an idealist.

297
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:10,428
ldealism and ambition are not incompatible.

298
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:15,006
l've fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks

299
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,560
while you take the profit. No...

300
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,209
l'm not a servant...            Senor Colombus,

301
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,180
you are in no position...

302
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:24,307
to bargain with me.

303
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,079
l'm not bargaining.

304
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,040
Then you are too ambitious.

305
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:33,649
And where you never ambitious?

306
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:42,231
ls ambition a virtue among nobles but a fault for the rest of us?

307
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:46,423
lf you won't accept we can simply find someone who will.

308
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:51,167
lf you can do that, Excellency...

309
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,808
l'll become a monk!

310
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:25,295
Your Majesty.

311
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,268
He'll become a monk...

312
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,272
lt would be a pity, wouldn't it?

313
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:35,576
Call him back.

314
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,119
She said yes.

315
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:59,131
lf l ever come back, l swear...

316
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:01,727
l don't want you to swear anything.

317
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,167
l don't want you to wait for me.

318
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:07,733
That's something you can't decide for me.

319
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:52,184
Forgive me Father, l have sinned.

320
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,313
l am listening, my son.

321
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,151
Father... l have betrayed my family.

322
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:04,123
l betrayed my men,

323
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:06,125
and l betrayed you.

324
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,420
l lied.

325
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,756
The journey is longer than l said.

326
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:14,540
How long?

327
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:16,542
l'm not sure...

328
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:20,441
How could anyone know. lt could be twice the distance.

329
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:23,350
You must tell them.

330
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,854
You must tell your men.            They wouldn't follow me.

331
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:29,847
You know l'm right. You must trust me.

332
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:33,788
You must speak to them. lf you don't, l will.

333
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:37,886
You made an oath.

334
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,993
May God forgive you.

335
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:44,163
l believed in you.

336
00:34:48,344 --> 00:34:49,804
Give me absolution.

337
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,174
Absolution, Father.

338
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:01,242
Ego te absolvo a pecatis tuis.

339
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,461
Enter.

340
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:34,560
Mendez...

341
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,667
Sit down.

342
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,340
Wine?

343
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:55,664
What is it, Mendez? Speak!

344
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,122
They wonder how you know our position with no sight of land?

345
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:08,594
What do you think, Mendez?

346
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:14,100
l know you navigate by the stars like the Moors...

347
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:16,581
but l don't know how?

348
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:25,090
Take this quadrant.

349
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:43,097
Find the North Star.

350
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,574
Steady yourself!

351
00:39:55,996 --> 00:39:57,789
Keep the plumbline vertical.

352
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,735
And don't move.

353
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:10,687
A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 600 leagues.

354
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:13,336
What do you read?

355
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:16,839
28.            That's it!

356
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:20,781
28th parallel. And we'll follow it until we reach land.

357
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,411
How do you know that we'll find land of 28th parallel?

358
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,051
l don't.

359
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,562
Mark 26, Sir.

360
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:02,070
Mark 27, Sir.

361
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:11,579
Mark 28!

362
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:19,691
Mark 29!

363
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:23,591
629!

364
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,326
629, Sir.

365
00:42:31,078 --> 00:42:32,266
l heard.

366
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,181
Captain, l don't understand.

367
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,308
l think l do.

368
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:08,928
We should've seen land.

369
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:14,308
We've been at sea nine weeks, Alonzo. Can't be that far.

370
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:18,021
Can't be that near.

371
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,787
l don't like the smell of this sea around here.

372
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,726
Smells like a whore!

373
00:43:26,164 --> 00:43:27,248
'Course it does.

374
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,731
That's why sailors go to sea.

375
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:34,558
And why is that one at sea?

376
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:36,800
Nobody knows.

377
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:39,302
He never says a word.

378
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:44,641
Captain Pinzon requests permission to board.

379
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:57,060
You mislead me. You lied to me.

380
00:43:57,529 --> 00:43:59,552
We are way past 750 leagues.

381
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:02,054
Six days ago, yes.            You must be mad!

382
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:04,984
Keep your voice down!

383
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,331
There'll be a mutiny!            You think l don't know?

384
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,469
We're lost!

385
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:16,277
Land is there. l know it.

386
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:17,570
You don't know anything.

387
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:21,949
Listen, these are my ships and we are turning back.

388
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:25,849
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is putrid!

389
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:28,184
l shouldn't have listened to you... You...

390
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:30,280
Listen, Pinzon! Pinzon.

391
00:44:30,562 --> 00:44:31,990
All we can do...

392
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:35,900
is go forward.

393
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:40,395
The land is there... The land is close.

394
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,825
You tell them that. You must tell them.

395
00:44:57,088 --> 00:45:01,551
God doesn't want us to cross this ocean. This voyage is cursed.

396
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:06,379
We set sail for greed. God has abandoned us.

397
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:10,696
The voyage is cursed. There are signs.

398
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:24,199
Juanito has the voice of an angel.

399
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:28,276
His mouth is blessed, but what comes out of yours is cursed.

400
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,651
Listen...

401
00:45:38,797 --> 00:45:41,393
We're all afraid at first.

402
00:45:41,393 --> 00:45:45,335
But those who overcome fear will rightly earn their reward.

403
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:51,997
l don't know if it's God's will that we should cross this ocean.

404
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:57,138
But l am certain it is you who puts fear into our hearts.

405
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:04,510
We can't be lost if we keep faith in God and in ourselves.

406
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:10,547
ln time...

407
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:17,961
they will talk of the courage of the first men to cross this ocean, and return.

408
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:20,432
And then you will be able to say to them,

409
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,257
l was on the Pinta...

410
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,770
l was on the Nina...

411
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:27,898
and the Santa Maria...

412
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:37,647
This jacket to he who sights land.

413
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:40,848
And 10,000 maravedis a year for life!

414
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:43,726
l wanna get a man aloft day and night!

415
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:00,670
Alonzo...

416
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:02,870
don't let the wind escape us.

417
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:11,713
You lucky bastard!

418
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:09,758
Mendez...

419
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:11,728
Mendez!

420
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:19,267
Land...

421
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,971
25 fathoms!

422
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:53,677
24 fathoms!

423
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,018
There...

424
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:18,063
Land ho!

425
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:37,113
Drop anchor!

426
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:35,604
Don Christopher...

427
00:55:04,508 --> 00:55:06,270
Excellencia...

428
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:25,352
By the...

429
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,962
By the Grace of God...

430
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:39,502
ln the name of their Gracious Majesties

431
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,015
of Castilla and Aragon...

432
00:55:58,698 --> 00:56:01,565
By all the powers vested in me...

433
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,862
l claim this island and name it...

434
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:10,314
San Salvador.

435
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:04,780
Don Christopher...

436
00:59:24,372 --> 00:59:26,061
Muskets!        No!

437
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:03,216
October 21 st, 1492.

438
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:06,959
l think We have returned to Eden.

439
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:12,027
Surely this is how the world was in the beginning of time.

440
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:16,573
lf the natives are to be converted to our ways

441
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:20,932
then it will be by persuasion and not by force.

442
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,478
l believe no man will ever see this land again as we do...

443
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:27,271
for the first time.

444
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,942
We come in peace and with honour.

445
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,351
They are not savages, neither will we be.

446
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,387
Treat them as you would your own wives and children.

447
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:41,650
Respect their beliefs.

448
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:46,155
Pillage will be punished by the whip. Rape, by the sword.

449
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,446
You?

450
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:41,283
Utapan.

451
01:04:42,555 --> 01:04:43,754
Utapan?

452
01:04:46,027 --> 01:04:46,997
Columbus.

453
01:04:48,394 --> 01:04:52,701
Co... Colum... Columbus.

454
01:04:53,775 --> 01:04:55,599
Co... lombus.

455
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:22,053
Where did you find this?

456
01:05:23,867 --> 01:05:25,525
Cuba!

457
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:24,219
Thanks... l've got a river of gold to piss.

458
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:51,684
Here!

459
01:06:57,961 --> 01:06:58,931
ls it gold?

460
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,496
No, no.

461
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:02,925
No good, no.

462
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:47,302
Utapan!

463
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:51,369
Utapan!

464
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:53,569
Alonzo! Alonzo!

465
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:58,616
Help him!

466
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,379
Help him!

467
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:13,224
Do something!

468
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,467
Pray for him.

469
01:08:37,123 --> 01:08:41,930
With Alonzo's death, l realise how vulnerable we are in these islands.

470
01:08:42,337 --> 01:08:44,234
How much we have to learn.

471
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:47,696
On every island...

472
01:08:48,436 --> 01:08:52,837
the natives welcome us with great generosity and trust.

473
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:59,009
Because of our appearance we have been mistaken for gods

474
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,284
and are treated accordingly.

475
01:09:02,982 --> 01:09:07,320
Despite the lndians' compliance we have not found gold in quantity,

476
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:12,617
except for the few artefacts they gave us as a sign of submission.

477
01:11:26,063 --> 01:11:27,554
You will speak first.

478
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,964
Tell him we thank him for his hospitality.

479
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:35,468
He knows.

480
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,534
Tell him some of my men are staying here

481
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:40,682
to build a fort.

482
01:11:41,943 --> 01:11:44,039
l want them to be well treated.

483
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,281
Tell him...

484
01:11:46,688 --> 01:11:48,377
we'll come back. Many of us.

485
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:52,318
He said, how many?

486
01:11:56,499 --> 01:11:59,221
As many as the leaves on that tree.

487
01:12:00,535 --> 01:12:02,526
And many more will follow.

488
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,303
Why?

489
01:12:10,211 --> 01:12:11,838
To bring the word of God.

490
01:12:16,217 --> 01:12:18,042
He says he has a God.

491
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:20,221
And also to bring medicine.

492
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:29,282
He says...

493
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:31,190
...he has medicine.

494
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:34,287
Tell him...

495
01:12:34,871 --> 01:12:36,727
we admire his people.

496
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:52,712
He knows you like his women and gold.

497
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:06,924
Pinzon is ill...

498
01:13:07,664 --> 01:13:11,262
eaten up by a fever that refuses to leave his body.

499
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:13,097
We must return to Spain.

500
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:19,103
39 men have volunteered to stay behind to build a fort.

501
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,033
l name it... La Navidad.

502
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:47,037
After 7 months, l haven't seen a civilisation

503
01:13:47,277 --> 01:13:50,176
that compares with Marco Polo's descriptions.

504
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:56,202
No cities, no bridges. No temples roofed with gold.

505
01:13:58,382 --> 01:14:00,686
The mainland still escapes me.

506
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,387
But l know it's there.

507
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:09,852
My ships are not filled with the spices and gold l was hoping for.

508
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:14,523
But this land intoxicates my senses and my soul.

509
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:19,830
And all l can think of is to return to this untamed land.

510
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,197
This unexplored Eden.

511
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:25,033
This is a chance for a new beginning.

512
01:15:00,548 --> 01:15:04,980
Majestates conjuncta Hispania.

513
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:09,276
Reges Ferdinandus et lsabella

514
01:15:10,026 --> 01:15:13,353
executores voluntas Dei sunt

515
01:15:13,822 --> 01:15:16,627
et cum vobis Regnum Domini

516
01:15:16,835 --> 01:15:21,235
per terras novas ultra mares crescatur

517
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,666
et in eas Crux Cristi

518
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,763
maneat semper.

519
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,667
lt won't be easy to get rid of him now.

520
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:32,327
On the contrary...

521
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,936
lt seems he is preparing his own cross.

522
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:24,963
Let the palate enjoy the flavour of the tobacco.

523
01:17:26,444 --> 01:17:27,435
Try it.

524
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:47,027
You say this is an lndian vice?

525
01:17:48,768 --> 01:17:51,792
l don't see the pleasure that would make it a sin.

526
01:17:54,608 --> 01:17:56,839
The lndians have no such word, Moxica.

527
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:01,031
Have they such thoughts?

528
01:18:02,782 --> 01:18:05,838
They come and go naked as God created them.

529
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:08,809
God? Which God?

530
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,819
Nature is their God.

531
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:23,126
lt's as if God and Nature were one.

532
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:27,693
They see him in a leaf... in a stone...

533
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,404
in a shell.

534
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:36,848
The islands...

535
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:39,778
are covered with trees.

536
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:44,188
Forgive me, Don Cristobal...

537
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:45,951
What about gold?

538
01:19:50,484 --> 01:19:52,746
lt's not the purest metal l've seen.

539
01:19:54,154 --> 01:19:55,520
ls there more?

540
01:20:00,025 --> 01:20:02,590
We are more than gratified, Cristobal.

541
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:01,586
Excellente.

542
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,797
You fence well.            For a commoner?

543
01:21:17,477 --> 01:21:18,499
So...

544
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,305
Your second expedition, hm?

545
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,807
17 ships...

546
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:28,311
and 1500 men?

547
01:21:29,114 --> 01:21:30,177
Thanks to you.

548
01:21:31,116 --> 01:21:33,712
This is Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

549
01:21:34,254 --> 01:21:35,818
He can be valuable to you.

550
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,416
He's very well acquainted with our laws.

551
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:55,807
l heard you'd be appointing Governors. Will you consider my application?

552
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,718
Forgive me, Don Francisco.

553
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,148
The positions are taken.

554
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:06,547
May l ask by whom?

555
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,187
By two very competent men.

556
01:22:11,667 --> 01:22:13,523
l trust their men of quality.

557
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:20,770
Francisco is qualified for high administration.

558
01:22:22,073 --> 01:22:23,168
Well...

559
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:26,306
we do lack notaries.

560
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:30,571
You should contact my administration.

561
01:22:33,584 --> 01:22:35,274
Francisco is a judge.

562
01:22:35,691 --> 01:22:37,046
Good...

563
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,090
we also need judges.

564
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,228
Except, there are no crimes as such.

565
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:46,191
l see l was mistaken.

566
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,069
He has no need

567
01:22:49,444 --> 01:22:50,998
for my services.

568
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,208
Sanchez.

569
01:22:57,661 --> 01:23:00,601
You have a special talent for making enemies.

570
01:23:00,799 --> 01:23:03,291
Why do l have so many already?

571
01:23:10,382 --> 01:23:15,220
Don't you think to rise so high in so short a time is dangerous occupation?

572
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,395
Beatrix...

573
01:23:36,606 --> 01:23:40,870
l can arrange for the Queen to take the boys into her service.

574
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,311
lt's a great honour, Beatrix.

575
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,356
We couldn't hope for anything better.

576
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,725
Anything better? Better than being with their mother?

577
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,341
lt's not what l meant.

578
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:55,302
What do you mean?            l'll be gone...

579
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:58,336
for several years.

580
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:02,382
l have powerful enemies at the court.

581
01:24:02,528 --> 01:24:05,291
The boys bear my name and bear my titles.

582
01:24:06,302 --> 01:24:08,398
This way they'll be untouchable.

583
01:24:09,076 --> 01:24:12,131
And you'll be free to see them whenever you please.

584
01:24:16,187 --> 01:24:18,283
You don't know what you're asking.

585
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,087
l do.

586
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:26,896
l wish l could give you another life.

587
01:24:32,558 --> 01:24:33,778
l am sorry.

588
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,061
Don't say that, because you're not.

589
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,387
You lead the life you chose for yourself...

590
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:42,171
and l chose you.

591
01:25:07,593 --> 01:25:10,564
You might have given us a choice. l'm a map maker!

592
01:25:10,637 --> 01:25:15,569
And now you're Lieutenant-General of the West lndies, Bartolome!

593
01:25:15,674 --> 01:25:18,875
He's just out of seminary and can't use a sword.

594
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:20,710
Never touched a sword!

595
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:23,525
You have time to learn.

596
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,195
What are you complaining about?

597
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:32,075
You can live the way we dream of.

598
01:25:32,347 --> 01:25:34,109
l don't share your dreams.

599
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:37,414
Do you refuse to help me?

600
01:25:38,488 --> 01:25:39,687
To help your brother?

601
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,129
Are you going to desert me?

602
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:53,347
You bastard! You always had your own way.

603
01:25:53,826 --> 01:25:56,694
l have always supported you.            l know.

604
01:25:56,892 --> 01:25:58,696
l went to Portugal...            l know!

605
01:25:58,936 --> 01:26:02,064
l'm the eldest!            How could we forget?

606
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:04,368
You've said it enough.

607
01:26:07,986 --> 01:26:10,040
Let me show you something.

608
01:26:13,763 --> 01:26:14,785
Excellency...

609
01:26:15,233 --> 01:26:16,568
lt's about my son...

610
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:43,345
See...

611
01:26:44,022 --> 01:26:46,087
Now, you tell me, who can l trust?

612
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,092
We're brothers. A bloodline.

613
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:54,470
l need you. Both of you.

614
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:55,868
Admiral!

615
01:26:55,982 --> 01:26:59,507
The horses are here. This pair's magnificent!

616
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,593
Send them Back!            What?

617
01:27:03,365 --> 01:27:04,553
They're like mules!

618
01:27:07,337 --> 01:27:09,642
l hope you did better with men!

619
01:27:10,048 --> 01:27:11,811
Who did we take on today?

620
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:17,222
30 blacksmiths. 28 halberdiers. 20 carpenters.

621
01:27:17,462 --> 01:27:18,786
100 farmers.

622
01:27:19,224 --> 01:27:20,590
20 miners.

623
01:27:21,101 --> 01:27:23,124
And Doctor Chanca,

624
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,709
the royal surgeon.

625
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,305
Then we can count on royal health.

626
01:28:29,169 --> 01:28:30,160
Fire!

627
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,006
Fire again!

628
01:28:40,211 --> 01:28:41,577
Where are they?

629
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:53,954
Drummers, sound the advance!

630
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:47,206
Almirante!

631
01:30:07,205 --> 01:30:08,664
Juanito.

632
01:30:20,718 --> 01:30:23,043
ls this your New World, Almirante?

633
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,578
We will teach these animals savagery.

634
01:30:26,818 --> 01:30:30,019
Three heads for every life taken. No mercy before God!

635
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,229
Vamonos!

636
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,824
No Moxica!

637
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,753
We'll be no revenge.

638
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:44,961
These were our cousins,

639
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:47,975
our friends, our countrymen.

640
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:50,769
But you say no revenge?

641
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,210
We will wash this in blood and now!

642
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:59,444
lf you want to keep your head do as l say.

643
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,542
l lost friends, too.

644
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,920
39 brave men who trusted me.

645
01:31:07,598 --> 01:31:09,819
You want war? Fine.

646
01:31:11,164 --> 01:31:13,959
We are 1000. They outnumber us by 10.

647
01:31:15,471 --> 01:31:17,400
Who will you kill? Which tribe?

648
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:20,538
We don't need to know.            Moxica...

649
01:31:21,581 --> 01:31:24,167
Try to remember who you are talking to.

650
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,487
We came here to stay.

651
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:33,916
Not to start a crusade.

652
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,523
So, we will swallow our anger.

653
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,630
And in the name of those who died,

654
01:31:41,059 --> 01:31:43,426
we will accomplish what we came for.

655
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:18,555
They're here.

656
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:11,222
There.

657
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:18,946
Guarionex! Ricardo!

658
01:34:20,124 --> 01:34:21,344
Arquebuses!

659
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,180
Preparen!

660
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:44,972
Ask him.

661
01:34:45,983 --> 01:34:47,412
What happened to my men?

662
01:34:53,157 --> 01:34:54,784
Warriors come from the sea.

663
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,121
Caribes. Guarionex says...

664
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,780
All fled to the hills.

665
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:02,156
When they came back

666
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:04,763
all the Spaniards... had gone.

667
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:06,598
God's mercy on them.

668
01:35:13,177 --> 01:35:14,637
The monkey's lying.

669
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:19,475
You talk too much.

670
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:23,146
Here they are. We should kill them.

671
01:35:24,491 --> 01:35:27,348
No... You'll do it my way.

672
01:35:31,456 --> 01:35:34,084
Tell him we will not harm his people.

673
01:35:35,366 --> 01:35:37,295
Even though we have the power to do it.

674
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,363
l'm prepared to believe him.

675
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:46,502
We will work with them and we want peace.

676
01:35:48,775 --> 01:35:50,267
Ask if he understands.

677
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:55,584
He understands.

678
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:57,983
Will he help?

679
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:04,552
He says you know

680
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:06,189
the answer.

681
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,981
Moxica... l need your horses.

682
01:38:55,327 --> 01:38:57,360
My horse does no work.

683
01:38:58,569 --> 01:39:00,123
We all have to work, Moxica.

684
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:02,427
Not my horse.

685
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,435
Forgive me, Moxica.

686
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,480
But it was your horse

687
01:39:13,918 --> 01:39:15,743
that l was talking about.

688
01:39:30,966 --> 01:39:32,020
Thank you, Moxica.

689
01:39:50,048 --> 01:39:51,247
Now...

690
01:39:52,623 --> 01:39:53,677
Heave!

691
01:41:49,407 --> 01:41:50,596
My dear sons...

692
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:58,041
ln unbearable heat, we are building the first city of the New World.

693
01:41:59,448 --> 01:42:02,316
l brought the plans of a Florentine architect,

694
01:42:03,223 --> 01:42:05,590
Leonardo... da Vinci.

695
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,490
God willing, we will build his ideal city.

696
01:42:12,732 --> 01:42:15,558
We are adapting to the lndian diet.

697
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,238
Meat is only a memory for us.

698
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:24,744
But in a week, the mill will be ready to produce of flour.

699
01:42:26,611 --> 01:42:29,478
Soon, we'll be eating bread.

700
01:42:30,782 --> 01:42:33,149
Never again l'll never underestimate it again.

701
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,152
Nor the simple comforts of home.

702
01:42:39,228 --> 01:42:41,313
You are always in my thoughts.

703
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,952
As ever, your Father.

704
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,613
You want her?

705
01:43:45,857 --> 01:43:47,921
Then you can have her.

706
01:43:49,829 --> 01:43:51,633
To the New World, my friend.

707
01:44:01,414 --> 01:44:02,968
To the Governor...

708
01:44:05,116 --> 01:44:06,273
of the mosquitoes.

709
01:44:22,602 --> 01:44:23,624
She's a good cook.

710
01:44:31,871 --> 01:44:33,206
What meat is it?

711
01:44:36,084 --> 01:44:37,064
lguana.

712
01:44:42,622 --> 01:44:44,520
What's wrong? lt's lndian dish.

713
01:44:44,624 --> 01:44:45,750
l'm not an lndian.

714
01:44:46,355 --> 01:44:49,379
You know Christopher, l think Giacomo is right.

715
01:44:49,629 --> 01:44:51,756
We can't live on corn and pepper.

716
01:44:51,964 --> 01:44:55,833
For the plantation, we need black slaves.

717
01:44:56,062 --> 01:44:59,128
Everything rots before it can be harvested.

718
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:03,361
Have you noticed? The horses and pigs multiply.

719
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:08,033
They keep mounting each other... Must be the heat.

720
01:45:09,075 --> 01:45:12,610
l must confess that the heat has a similar effect on me.

721
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:19,888
You're both right.

722
01:45:20,556 --> 01:45:23,183
But the fort must be finished before the rains.

723
01:45:23,757 --> 01:45:25,592
We must rely on our strengths.

724
01:45:26,999 --> 01:45:28,491
What do you mean?

725
01:45:29,304 --> 01:45:31,097
Every able man must work.

726
01:45:33,808 --> 01:45:36,791
All of us. lncluding nobility.

727
01:45:41,816 --> 01:45:43,474
They're exempt, Christopher.

728
01:45:45,581 --> 01:45:48,677
Well... Now they won't be.

729
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:36,361
Next.

730
01:46:36,892 --> 01:46:37,956
Name?

731
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:11,625
Name?            Colpa.

732
01:47:15,504 --> 01:47:17,527
What's he saying?

733
01:47:17,902 --> 01:47:18,997
He's found none.

734
01:47:20,676 --> 01:47:22,261
Why? Ask him why!

735
01:47:24,742 --> 01:47:26,504
Stop him! Bring him back!

736
01:47:33,386 --> 01:47:34,471
Hasn't found any.

737
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,601
He's lying.

738
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:52,124
Tell him...

739
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:56,607
to put his hand on the table. Like this.

740
01:48:01,644 --> 01:48:02,478
Tell them...

741
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,472
l know they are hiding the gold from us.

742
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,084
And tell them...

743
01:48:16,325 --> 01:48:18,880
this is how we treat thieves and liars.

744
01:48:19,297 --> 01:48:21,518
Don Adrian, you cannot do this thing.

745
01:48:22,029 --> 01:48:23,593
l can't?

746
01:48:28,566 --> 01:48:29,536
l can.

747
01:48:41,778 --> 01:48:44,541
Your act of brutality has created chaos.

748
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:51,110
All the tribes are now joining forces against us.

749
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:55,823
All of that because of your criminal savagery.

750
01:48:56,198 --> 01:48:57,189
Savagery...

751
01:48:57,596 --> 01:48:59,566
is what monkeys understand.

752
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:05,468
You should have done the same a long time ago, Don Cristobal.

753
01:49:05,968 --> 01:49:07,303
Your ways...

754
01:49:07,804 --> 01:49:09,274
don't work.

755
01:49:12,047 --> 01:49:15,280
You'll be put in detention, deprived of privileges,

756
01:49:16,312 --> 01:49:19,378
until you are sent to Spain for judgement.

757
01:49:20,254 --> 01:49:21,745
Have anything to say?

758
01:49:34,987 --> 01:49:37,417
For four years now...

759
01:49:38,459 --> 01:49:39,617
we've been here.

760
01:49:40,388 --> 01:49:44,726
We stayed here four years

761
01:49:45,936 --> 01:49:48,156
because we believed your promises.

762
01:49:49,606 --> 01:49:51,660
But we find neither gold

763
01:49:52,442 --> 01:49:55,768
nor your earthly paradise.

764
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:13,682
You and your brothers...

765
01:50:15,726 --> 01:50:17,425
have failed.

766
01:50:19,563 --> 01:50:23,796
Senor... Colombo!

767
01:50:45,453 --> 01:50:48,446
Don Giacomo, come at once!            What's happening?

768
01:50:48,654 --> 01:50:51,021
ln the mine! Get Don Christopher!

769
01:51:59,694 --> 01:52:00,893
Cut him down!

770
01:52:05,304 --> 01:52:07,494
Cut the ropes!

771
01:52:14,209 --> 01:52:15,731
Moxica's right.

772
01:52:16,148 --> 01:52:17,973
Your ways don't work.

773
01:52:19,652 --> 01:52:20,705
We have to find them.

774
01:52:22,321 --> 01:52:23,374
Did you hear me?

775
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,845
You have to find them!

776
01:52:26,294 --> 01:52:27,587
You see what they did?

777
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:30,913
You did the same to your God.

778
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,826
You know them?

779
01:52:45,177 --> 01:52:47,169
Goohooni. Goohooni.

780
01:55:33,637 --> 01:55:34,628
Charge!

781
01:56:08,047 --> 01:56:10,236
Stop!

782
01:59:59,236 --> 02:00:00,571
Fire!

783
02:02:27,551 --> 02:02:28,604
Moxica.

784
02:02:59,354 --> 02:03:00,543
You know...

785
02:03:01,189 --> 02:03:03,911
what will be said about this in Spain...

786
02:03:05,256 --> 02:03:06,309
don't you?

787
02:03:19,134 --> 02:03:21,157
You are nothing.

788
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:27,403
Your bastards will never inherit your titles.

789
02:03:27,611 --> 02:03:29,238
No...

790
02:03:30,812 --> 02:03:32,178
We...

791
02:03:33,722 --> 02:03:36,683
We are everything.

792
02:03:40,186 --> 02:03:42,658
We are immortal.

793
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:14,658
Bastard!

794
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:01,223
Don Christopher...

795
02:06:05,665 --> 02:06:07,188
l wish to return to Spain.

796
02:06:08,668 --> 02:06:10,764
l have no desire to remain...

797
02:06:11,411 --> 02:06:12,995
in this Godless place.

798
02:06:14,278 --> 02:06:15,613
They are criminals.

799
02:06:16,343 --> 02:06:20,712
They have a debt towards Spain. Moxica paid. They will pay, too.

800
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:24,278
l don't understand you, Don Christopher.

801
02:06:25,185 --> 02:06:28,355
You treat Christians equally with heathen savages.

802
02:06:28,428 --> 02:06:30,450
And what do you offer in return?

803
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:36,394
A New World, Buyl.

804
02:06:38,365 --> 02:06:40,064
No one wants one.

805
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:42,504
Only you.

806
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,600
Not only me.

807
02:06:45,538 --> 02:06:46,529
Look at them.

808
02:06:47,144 --> 02:06:49,605
They could go back to their families.

809
02:06:50,981 --> 02:06:51,951
But they stay.

810
02:06:52,545 --> 02:06:56,112
They want something new. A new world.

811
02:06:59,188 --> 02:07:00,022
l'll be leave...

812
02:07:01,461 --> 02:07:03,317
on the next ship.

813
02:07:03,994 --> 02:07:06,049
Leave if you please but...

814
02:07:07,894 --> 02:07:11,491
your departure won't help me make this place more Godly.

815
02:07:30,656 --> 02:07:34,452
Perhaps hope only exists in the journey, Giacomo.

816
02:07:36,496 --> 02:07:38,654
At beginning everything's possible.

817
02:07:38,894 --> 02:07:41,553
Every expectation, every dream.

818
02:07:42,397 --> 02:07:45,234
No one expected this to be easy.

819
02:07:46,266 --> 02:07:48,831
This isn't how l imagined it to be, Christopher.

820
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:53,210
Marchena was right, Bartolome.

821
02:07:59,414 --> 02:08:02,782
Paradise and Hell both can be earthly.

822
02:08:03,418 --> 02:08:06,213
We carry them wherever we go.

823
02:09:57,564 --> 02:09:58,586
Utopan!

824
02:10:01,265 --> 02:10:02,256
Speak to me!

825
02:10:03,174 --> 02:10:05,864
You never learned to speak my language.

826
02:12:39,392 --> 02:12:43,594
Your Majesty, here are the true facts concerning the island of Hispaniola.

827
02:12:44,637 --> 02:12:49,694
The activity of your servant Columbus, Admiral of the Oceans and Governor of the

828
02:12:51,175 --> 02:12:54,366
the truth he now presides over a state of chaos,

829
02:12:55,043 --> 02:12:58,505
of degradation and of madness.

830
02:12:59,986 --> 02:13:04,751
From beginning He had shown he was incapable of managing the islands

831
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:08,818
he appointed his brothers very important positions,

832
02:13:09,996 --> 02:13:12,457
injuring the pride and dignity of nobles.

833
02:13:13,729 --> 02:13:15,324
He promised to build a city.

834
02:13:15,929 --> 02:13:17,920
lsabel, after Your Majesty.

835
02:13:19,005 --> 02:13:21,664
A group of mud huts in the wrong place,

836
02:13:21,768 --> 02:13:24,667
swept away by the rains and mud.

837
02:13:26,043 --> 02:13:27,409
He promised gold,

838
02:13:27,472 --> 02:13:29,995
not finding the amounts he promised.

839
02:13:30,141 --> 02:13:35,271
He has since commanded the lndians to pay a tax...

840
02:13:36,283 --> 02:13:39,014
a monthly tribute of gold.

841
02:13:39,557 --> 02:13:43,926
Most being unable to, we find, have been punished

842
02:13:44,895 --> 02:13:46,386
or massacred.

843
02:13:49,462 --> 02:13:52,695
Columbus forced nobility to hard labour,

844
02:13:53,466 --> 02:13:56,031
treating them equally with lndians.

845
02:13:56,636 --> 02:13:58,899
He reduced them into his slaves.

846
02:13:59,472 --> 02:14:02,934
When Adrian de Moxica protested against this,

847
02:14:03,977 --> 02:14:05,239
he was executed.

848
02:14:05,843 --> 02:14:07,512
ls this true, Brother Buyl?

849
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:09,305
Yes, Your Excellency.

850
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:12,652
These all true. All of it. l saw it.

851
02:14:13,090 --> 02:14:14,644
With my own eyes.

852
02:14:15,687 --> 02:14:17,178
Well...

853
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:19,253
He promised a Paradise.

854
02:14:24,904 --> 02:14:25,957
He failed.

855
02:14:28,001 --> 02:14:29,836
He must be replaced.

856
02:14:31,411 --> 02:14:32,568
lmmediately.

857
02:14:35,415 --> 02:14:39,502
And who would you think of for such a task?

858
02:14:41,817 --> 02:14:43,475
l am thinking of a man.

859
02:14:45,216 --> 02:14:47,343
A man devoted to Your Majesties.

860
02:14:50,054 --> 02:14:51,754
A man extremely motivated.

861
02:15:33,368 --> 02:15:34,828
Excellency, l'm sorry.

862
02:15:37,769 --> 02:15:40,834
Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

863
02:15:42,648 --> 02:15:46,079
Yes... l remember.

864
02:15:47,111 --> 02:15:49,051
My letters of appointment.

865
02:15:58,060 --> 02:16:01,031
l am the new Viceroy of the lndies.

866
02:16:01,428 --> 02:16:02,950
Congratulations.

867
02:16:04,566 --> 02:16:06,725
Then l can search for the mainland?

868
02:16:08,205 --> 02:16:11,000
The mainland was discovered weeks ago.

869
02:16:11,073 --> 02:16:12,501
By another ltalian.

870
02:16:17,047 --> 02:16:19,373
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

871
02:16:31,791 --> 02:16:32,886
How far?

872
02:16:33,533 --> 02:16:37,391
l'm no seaman, but l heard it's no more than a week at sea.

873
02:16:40,873 --> 02:16:43,532
l hope not too disappointed.

874
02:16:46,806 --> 02:16:48,297
How could l be?

875
02:16:50,477 --> 02:16:55,680
The mainland has been found exactly as l said it would.

876
02:17:00,925 --> 02:17:03,980
l'm afraid this isn't the worst news.

877
02:17:47,805 --> 02:17:48,795
Diego?

878
02:17:49,838 --> 02:17:50,829
Father.

879
02:17:54,311 --> 02:17:55,709
Fernando.

880
02:17:56,115 --> 02:17:58,378
Oh, my God!

881
02:18:00,849 --> 02:18:01,840
A man?

882
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,113
How did this happen?

883
02:18:06,657 --> 02:18:07,648
Diego.

884
02:18:18,033 --> 02:18:19,055
Don't worry.

885
02:18:19,566 --> 02:18:21,359
We're going to get you out.

886
02:18:21,766 --> 02:18:23,966
Santangel's going to the Queen.            Good.

887
02:18:24,175 --> 02:18:25,165
Good.

888
02:18:27,845 --> 02:18:29,868
l'll go back when they free me.

889
02:18:30,212 --> 02:18:31,578
This time with me.

890
02:18:33,017 --> 02:18:35,613
ln your present state it is madness, Father.

891
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:37,605
You needn't come with us.

892
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:44,612
Diego.

893
02:18:47,166 --> 02:18:48,491
Diego.

894
02:19:50,094 --> 02:19:51,084
Rise, please.

895
02:20:01,303 --> 02:20:02,502
Now...

896
02:20:03,472 --> 02:20:05,463
l do look older than you.

897
02:20:13,148 --> 02:20:18,518
l have looked for a reason why l should allow you to go back.

898
02:20:19,425 --> 02:20:22,220
And though l tried l could not find one.

899
02:20:24,826 --> 02:20:26,192
Help me find one.

900
02:20:31,635 --> 02:20:36,974
All my life l have dreamed of reaching the continent.

901
02:20:37,579 --> 02:20:41,666
l thought my dreams... grandiose.

902
02:20:44,648 --> 02:20:48,413
But reality was beyond my expectations.

903
02:20:49,017 --> 02:20:50,488
Far beyond.

904
02:20:54,554 --> 02:20:55,785
And now...

905
02:20:59,528 --> 02:21:01,832
l want to explore that land.

906
02:21:10,539 --> 02:21:12,061
Before l die.

907
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,360
l allow you...

908
02:21:31,466 --> 02:21:33,760
to undertake another voyage.

909
02:21:34,803 --> 02:21:35,856
Thank you.

910
02:21:37,868 --> 02:21:39,526
But without your brothers.

911
02:21:41,007 --> 02:21:42,800
You can't go to Santo Domingo

912
02:21:42,978 --> 02:21:44,938
or the other colonies.

913
02:21:47,117 --> 02:21:48,337
The New World...

914
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:51,173
is a disaster.

915
02:21:57,221 --> 02:22:00,245
And the old one... an achievement?

916
02:22:38,564 --> 02:22:39,857
l know...

917
02:22:40,233 --> 02:22:43,027
l shouldn't tolerate his impertinence.

918
02:22:45,676 --> 02:22:46,864
Then why?

919
02:22:50,649 --> 02:22:52,547
Because he's not afraid of me.

920
02:22:57,281 --> 02:22:58,449
Sanchez!

921
02:23:09,064 --> 02:23:10,430
You're a dreamer.

922
02:23:18,135 --> 02:23:19,261
Look out there.

923
02:23:23,808 --> 02:23:24,934
What do you see?

924
02:23:32,618 --> 02:23:33,818
l see towers.

925
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:37,686
l see palaces, l see steeples.

926
02:23:38,864 --> 02:23:40,626
l see civilisation.

927
02:23:42,201 --> 02:23:44,391
And l see spires that reach...

928
02:23:46,163 --> 02:23:47,602
to the sky!

929
02:23:53,243 --> 02:23:55,537
All created by people like me.

930
02:23:57,414 --> 02:23:59,312
No matter how long you live,

931
02:24:00,813 --> 02:24:03,879
one thing will never change between us.

932
02:24:06,350 --> 02:24:07,612
l did it.

933
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,990
You didn't.

934
02:25:26,733 --> 02:25:28,099
You're so beautiful.

935
02:25:37,577 --> 02:25:38,953
l can't believe another man

936
02:25:38,953 --> 02:25:41,716
has never taken you from me.

937
02:25:42,749 --> 02:25:46,085
They tried... but l didn't let them.

938
02:25:53,134 --> 02:25:54,688
They took everything.

939
02:25:56,398 --> 02:25:57,597
Not everything.

940
02:25:59,974 --> 02:26:01,100
You think l care?

941
02:26:03,207 --> 02:26:04,833
l'm a free man again.

942
02:26:07,044 --> 02:26:10,839
Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier.

943
02:26:15,552 --> 02:26:18,680
God! How much l've missed you.

944
02:26:21,923 --> 02:26:25,656
By the Grace of God and Your Beneficient Majesty,

945
02:26:26,501 --> 02:26:28,555
a new continent has now been found

946
02:26:28,899 --> 02:26:32,340
and claimed in the name of the Spanish Crown,

947
02:26:33,205 --> 02:26:35,364
in the year 1492.

948
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:38,189
As Your Majesty is aware,

949
02:26:39,618 --> 02:26:40,827
the University of Salamanca

950
02:26:41,005 --> 02:26:43,632
has always defended the theory

951
02:26:44,018 --> 02:26:46,917
of the existence of unknown territories to the west.

952
02:26:49,034 --> 02:26:52,141
The surest route to the continent is now firmly established.

953
02:26:52,808 --> 02:26:56,562
West by south-west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo.

954
02:26:57,261 --> 02:26:58,043
From there...

955
02:26:58,428 --> 02:27:01,285
west-north-west from San Juan to the north,

956
02:27:02,109 --> 02:27:05,800
reaching the island of Hispaniola on the Cape of San Raphael.

957
02:27:06,457 --> 02:27:10,034
Then onto the mainland at Cape Gracias A Dios.

958
02:27:11,306 --> 02:27:13,610
Spain, by Your Majesty's grace,

959
02:27:14,111 --> 02:27:16,217
has confirmed for all humanity,

960
02:27:16,718 --> 02:27:18,480
the existence of a New World.

961
02:27:20,023 --> 02:27:22,505
Terra lncognita.

962
02:27:23,672 --> 02:27:27,656
lt was discovered by a mariner commissioned by Your Majesty.

963
02:27:28,396 --> 02:27:29,386
His name...

964
02:27:31,232 --> 02:27:33,714
Amerigo Vespucci.

965
02:28:02,201 --> 02:28:02,962
Sanchez...

966
02:28:11,397 --> 02:28:13,556
What a tragedy. What a waste of a life.

967
02:28:14,348 --> 02:28:15,287
A waste?

968
02:28:16,069 --> 02:28:18,498
lf your name or mine is ever remembered...

969
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:21,324
it will only be because of his.

970
02:28:36,047 --> 02:28:40,760
Diego is at court with Santangel hoping to get your privileges restored.

971
02:28:40,895 --> 02:28:42,001
But how is he?

972
02:28:42,981 --> 02:28:45,254
He wants to start a pearl trade in Santo Domingo.

973
02:28:46,505 --> 02:28:48,570
He has received many letters from your men.

974
02:28:49,268 --> 02:28:50,103
He sent some of them.

975
02:28:52,616 --> 02:28:54,503
This one's from Mendez.            Mendez?

976
02:28:55,108 --> 02:28:56,046
What does he say?

977
02:28:57,714 --> 02:29:00,311
He asks to visit you. He left his address.

978
02:29:01,937 --> 02:29:04,273
He never had one. Except aboard my ships.

979
02:29:08,652 --> 02:29:10,467
l want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.

980
02:29:12,156 --> 02:29:14,012
l wouldn't know where to start.

981
02:29:14,095 --> 02:29:16,275
Tell me the first thing that comes to mind.

982
02:29:35,888 --> 02:29:41,008
l remember...

983
02:30:38,576 --> 02:30:45,666
ln 1502, Columbus made a final trip to the New World with Fernando.

984
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:57,584
They reached Panama where the lndians told them of the Pacific Ocean.

985
02:30:58,085 --> 02:31:08,689
His son's biography gave Columbus his rightful place in history.

986
02:31:09,179 --> 02:31:21,181
ln 1992, one of his descendants is Honorary Admiral of the Spanish Navy.

987
02:31:21,754 --> 02:31:33,328
There is more imagination in life than in dreams...
