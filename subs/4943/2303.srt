00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,110
By the numbers, man. You got us started off just right.
伙计们 按顺序进行 你这开头很好

272
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,830
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?
我们晚点再谈 好吗?

273
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,270
Their blind eyes see nothing of the horrors to come.
他们还没意识到 接下来的是多恐怖

274
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,330
Their ears are stopped.
他们什么也听不进去

275
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,510
They are the God's fool.
真是愚蠢

276
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,740
Well, that's... how it works.
那... 该怎么做

277
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,690
Cleanse them. Cleanse the world of their ignorance and sin.
干掉他们 让他们的愚昧和罪恶从这个世界消失

278
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,290
Bathe them in the crimson of...
让他们身上沾满血腥...

279
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,480
Am I on speakerphone?
你开免提了?

280
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,900
No. Absolutely not.
不 没有

281
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,880
Speakerphone, no. No, I wouldn't do that.
免提 不 没有 我没开

282
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,010
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.
不 你开了 我听见回声了

283
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,570
Oh, my God. You're right. Hang on one second,I'll take you off.
哦 天哪 你说的没错 等一下 我把免提关了

284
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,420
That's rude. I don't know who's in the room.
太无礼了 我都不知道谁在屋子里

285
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,400

Thank you.

287
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,770
Don't take this lightly, boy.
别掉以轻心 伙计

288
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,570
It wasn't all by your numbers.
这不是你能决定的

289
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,270
The fool nearly derailed the invocation with his insolence.
这些蠢货差点破坏了祷告

290
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,040
The ancient ones see everything.
祖先们都看着呢

291
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,550
And they will not be...
他们不会...

292
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,250
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?
你还开着免提 是不是?

293
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,470
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

I can't believe it. I did it again!

How cold? Is it worth it?

Come on, Jules. Life is risk.
来吧 朱尔斯 生命在于刺激

- 别逗了  - 不 伙计们 我认真地 就在那儿

Did you see who they picked?

They're practically giving their money away.

You should talk, Aquaman.

I'm not even sure we have one of these.

Zoology swears we do.

Hey, what do you got?

What do you want from me?

328
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,140
If they were creative, they wouldn't be in maintenance.
如果他们富有创造力 就不会在维修部了

329
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,270
You're gonna have to split this if you win. You wanna switch?
如果你赢了就要和他们分奖金 想换吗?

More than anything, I just want this moment to end.

Not for me. Thanks.

Seems a little harsh,doesn't it?
看起来挺没节操的 是吧?

335
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,730
It's just people letting off steam.
只是宣泄而已

336
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,870
This job isn't easy,however those clowns may behave.
工作压力是大 不过这种胡闹确实有点过了 

337
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,330
Does the director...Do they know about this downstairs?
主管... 他们知道下面是这样的吗?

338
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,700
The director doesn't care about this stuff.
主管才不关心这些事呢

339
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,480
As long as everything goes smoothly upstairs.
只要上面一切正常就好啦

340
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,420
as long as the kids do as they're told.
只要孩子们都听话

341
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,810
But then it's fixed.

342
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,520
No,no,no.
不 不 不

343
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,770
How can you wager on this when you control the outcome?
结局都是由你们操控 还有什么好赌的?

344
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,540
No,we just get 'em in the cellar. They take it from there.
不 我们只是引他们进入地窖  接下来还是看他们自己

345
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,740
No,they have to make the choice of their own free will.
不 他们将按照自己的意志作出选择

346
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,640
Otherwise the system doesn't work.
否则系统不会运作

347
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,610
It's like the harbinger.
比如说那个先知

348
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,310
It's this creepy old fuck,practically wears a sign,"You will die."
老掉牙的惊悚套路 典型的警告 "你们都会死"

349
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,320
Why do we put him there? The system.
干吗要放这么个人呢? 这是规定

350
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,840
They have to choose to ignore him..

and they have to choose what happens in the cellar.
他们必须自己在地窖选择将要面对的东西

352
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,190
Yeah,we rig the game as much as we need to.
我们只在必须的范围内控制游戏进程

353
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,360
but in the end,they don't transgress.
但是到最后 只要他们不越界

354
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,660
They can't be punished.
那他们也不会受到惩罚

355
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,360
So what's it gonna be,Truman?You in? Window's closing.
怎么样 杜鲁门? 要加入吗? 就要截止了

356
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,280
