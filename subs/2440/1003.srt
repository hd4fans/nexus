1
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,110
They say ignorance is bliss.

2
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,072
For the first time
in my life, I agree.

3
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,824
I wish...

4
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,953
...I had never uncovered
the awful truth.

5
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,038
I know now...

6
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,001
...once they find out,
they will try to silence me.

7
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,381
That is why I've written this
all down for you in this letter.

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,551
You are the only one
whom I can tell this to.

9
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,889
The only one who could
possibly understand.

10
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,642
Good luck, my friend.

11
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,352
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

12
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,569
Mr. Fuller,
nice having you here.

13
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,696
Your usual table?

14
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,574
No, thanks, Gene.

15
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,396
Her name is Erika.

16
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,901
She's from Toledo.

17
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,447
Ashton, would you do me a favor?

18
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,032
You'd like to meet her?

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,951
I want you...

20
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,871
...to keep this letter.

21
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,833
Somebody will ask for it.
A man named Douglas Hall.

22
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,921
Remember, it's crucial
that he receives it.

23
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,174
It's a walk in the park.

24
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,354
Going home, Mr. Fuller?

25
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,189
Yes, Charlie.

26
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,759
We're out of cat food, honey.

27
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,053
Yes, I'll buy some in the morning.

28
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,393
You've been smoking again.

29
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,375
Download complete.

30
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,628
Link to simulation terminated.

31
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,123
Martini, please.

32
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,218
One martini.

33
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,303
You forgot the olive.

34
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,972
We're out of olives.

35
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,891
How about pretzels?

36
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,935
No, thank you.

37
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,907
Please leave a message at the tone.

38
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,409
Douglas, it's me.

39
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,789
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

40
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,499
This changes everything.

41
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,225
I don't know....

42
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,437
I don't even know how to begin.

43
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,151
What are you doing?

44
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,834
You have new messages.

45
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,143
You have new messages.

46
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,611
You have three new messages.

47
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,780
First new message: 5:25 a.m.

48
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,826
Douglas, it's Hilary.
Don't forget to call Marshall.

49
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,120
Legal is screaming
for the contract.

50
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,707
I'll have a notary come
to the office at lunch.

51
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,585
Next new message: 5:48 a.m.

52
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,049
It's me again.
Please call me as soon as you get up.

53
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,969
Next new message: 6:13 a.m.

54
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,890
Mr. Douglas Hall,
this is Detective McBain, LAPD.

55
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,100
I'd appreciate a callback, please.

56
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,812
My phone number is 555-7876.

57
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,247
I'm Detective Zev Bernstein.

58
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,958
Sorry to drag you
out of bed so early.

59
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,710
This is Detective McBain.

60
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,757
Mr. Hall?

61
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,634
Thanks for coming down.

62
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,094
Where is he?

63
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,222
-Can I get you some coffee?
-No, thank you.

64
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,934
That him?

65
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,284
We found him in an alley
at Spring and Grand.

66
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,621
Looks like he ran into some guy
who wasn't just asking for a quarter.

67
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,498
Carved him up like a ham.

68
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,084
Took everything:
wallet, credit cards.

69
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,336
Got a kick out of it.

70
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,631
What's your connection
to the old man?

71
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,301
I worked with him for six years.

72
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,386
He was my boss.

73
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,764
My friend.

74
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,936
Hey, cigarette?

75
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,941
I don't smoke.

76
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,069
We found these on him.

77
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,448
Traced the prescription.
According to his doctor...

78
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,452
...Fuller listed you to call
in case of medical emergencies.

79
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,454
He had no next of kin?

80
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,748
No, he didn't.

81
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,249
You sure?

82
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,710
I think he would've told me.

83
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,212
Have any idea who killed him?

84
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,549
Everybody liked him.

85
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,222
Mind if I tag along?

86
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,062
Or we can continue in my office,
if that's more convenient.

87
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,564
That's fine.

88
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,989
What do you do
for a paycheck, anyway?

89
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,574
Computer software.

90
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,786
Would you mind taking care
of the car this morning?

91
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,456
-Must make some decent bucks, huh?
-I make a living.

92
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,919
-This was his apartment.
-You could be home already.

93
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,132
I see these signs
every time I leave work:

94
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,803
"You could be home already.
Apartment living in downtown."

95
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,849
Never expected it could look
anything like this.

96
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,603
This company was Fuller's life.
He worked and lived here.

97
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,107
So what exactly
do you people do here?

98
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,777
You wouldn't be interested.

99
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,196
I'm paid to be interested.

100
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,240
Computer research.

101
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,451
Fuller was onto...

102
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,579
...a whole new frontier.

103
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,207
Very sensitive material.

104
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,042
Not at liberty to discuss it.

105
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,171
A lot of money involved.

106
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,591
This apartment must be worth
a few million dollars.

107
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,636
One of the perks of the job.

108
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,227
This job has a whole lot of perks.

109
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,404
Can I help you?

110
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,503
I just talked to him two days ago.

111
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,966
I can't believe he's gone.

112
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,513
My name is Jane Fuller.

113
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,931
Hannon was my father.

114
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,979
I'm sorry.
I'm Douglas Hall.

115
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,276
You're the one
he always wanted me to meet.

116
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,321
He never mentioned
that he had a daughter.

117
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,656
He didn't?

118
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,121
I arrived from Paris this morning.
I was supposed to meet him.

119
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,415
But then I heard.

120
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,792
My condolences, Miss Fuller.

121
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,794
I'm Detective McBain, LAPD.

122
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,214
I have to ask you some questions.

123
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,176
-Of course.
-Would you excuse us, Mr. Hall?

124
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,804
Sure.

125
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,063
Have we ever met before?

126
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,609
No, that's not possible.

127
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,196
You look very familiar.

128
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,032
Nice to meet you, Miss Fuller.

129
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,074
Hey, Whitney.
How you doing?

130
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,244
Sliced him up like an animal.

131
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,706
And for what?

132
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,752
He was the Einstein of our generation.
It's a waste.

133
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,758
What the hell happened
while I was away?

134
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,055
He was jacking
into the system a lot.

135
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,184
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?

136
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,604
We're months away
from the first trial run.

137
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,857
We are. You know, he was
taking a big chance.

138
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,319
What was I supposed to do?
You know how he is.

139
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,073
Were there complications?

140
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,950
None that I know of yet.

141
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,373
Did he ever tell you
he had a daughter?

142
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,252
-Why?
-Because I just met her.

143
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,962
You're kidding me.

144
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,480
John, I need the number
of that cab company.

145
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,981
No need, sir.

146
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,025
She went to the Omni Hotel.

147
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,707
Detective McBain.

148
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,168
Sorry to disappoint you.

149
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,670
I'll find Doug.

150
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,339
It's you I wanted to talk with.

151
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,800
What for?

152
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,219
Want me to catch your boss's killer?

153
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,262
Of course.

154
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,225
The whole thing's
a giant computer game?

155
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,562
No, it doesn't need a user
to interact with it to function.

156
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,358
Its units are fully formed,
self-learning cyber beings.

157
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,486
-Units?
-Electronic, simulated characters.

158
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,905
They populate the system.

159
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,240
They think...

160
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,700
...they work...

161
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,159
...they eat.

162
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,661
They fuck?

163
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,207
Let's just say that
they're modeled after us.

164
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,753
Right now, we have a working
prototype: Los Angeles, circa 1937.

165
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,422
Why '37?

166
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,843
Fuller wanted to start by re-creating
the era of his youth.

167
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,261
You see...

168
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,223
...while my mind is jacked in...

169
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,270
...I'm walking around
experiencing 1937.

170
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,230
My body stays here...

171
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,651
...and holds the consciousness
of the program link unit.

172
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,155
You think one of them units
crawled up an extension cord...

173
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,740
...and killed its maker?

174
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,205
Miss Fuller checked in yet?

175
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,044
Miss Fuller.

176
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,590
Glad I caught you.

177
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,258
Mr. Hall.

178
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,553
What are you doing here?

179
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,389
It's about your father, actually.

180
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,309
You said you spoke with him
a few days ago.

181
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,438
Can you tell me anything
about that conversation?

182
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,150
Did he seem strange to you at all?

183
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,781
He'd been under
a lot of stress lately.

184
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,160
He asked me to fly to the States,
so I could help with the company.

185
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
Help him run it?

186
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,748
Shut it down.

187
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,671
I worked with him for six years.
If he wanted to shut it down...

188
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,049
...he would've told me about it.

189
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,511
He didn't tell you about me.

190
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,103
But I wish he had.

191
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,247
It's nice to see you again.

192
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,000
Sorry I'm late. Have you looked
through the paperwork?

193
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,963
Yes, I have. And I think
we have a very strong case.

194
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,549
The company should be
yours in no time.

195
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,552
-Strong case?
-What I'm saying is, your father...

196
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,721
...changed his will
in favor of the employees.

197
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,350
In fact, you aren't mentioned
in the original will either.

198
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,979
But as I said, I think
we have a very strong case.

199
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,315
Who will head the board now?

200
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,984
Douglas Hall.

201
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,118
Not bad.

202
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,912
Owner of a $2 billion enterprise.

203
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,166
Strange, Fuller would amend
his will just before he died.

204
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,878
I was on an airplane
when it happened.

205
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:18,174
According to the security guard,
Fuller left the office at 10:30 p.m.

206
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,343
30 minutes after your plane arrived.

207
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,266
Autopsy shows that
he died around midnight.

208
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,520
-You had time to catch up with him.
-But I didn't.

209
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,817
-I went straight home.
-Didn't talk to him?

210
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,279
No e-mails, no faxes,
not even a message?

211
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,530
None of the above.

212
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,825
You know, that's funny.

213
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,703
We checked Fuller's phone records.

214
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,248
He made a call with
his calling card at 11:02 p.m.

215
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,461
Shit!

216
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,547
Your home number.

217
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,096
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave town for a couple of days.

218
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,433
And get that game fixed.

219
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,018
It's missing a spring.

220
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,490
You have no new--

221
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,742
Restore. Restore.

222
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,372
To restore messages,
press "rewind" now.

223
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,668
-Yesterday at 2:45 p.m.
-I managed to reschedule--

224
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,838
-Yesterday at 5:14 p.m.
-Hello, Mr. Hall--

225
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:43,134
-Yesterday at 11:02 p.m.
-Douglas, it's me.

226
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,596
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

227
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,306
This changes everything.

228
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,227
I'm here in some bar on Main and 7th.

229
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,606
In case something happens to me,
I left you a message in the system.

230
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,483
I gave it to--

231
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,777
How did you find me?

232
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,385
What's going on?

233
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm trying to get
into Fuller's files.

234
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,016
For what?

235
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,519
He left a message for me
the night he died.

236
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,150
-He knew someone wanted to kill him.
-Did you tell the police?

237
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,943
-No.
-Why not?

238
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,822
He also said he left a message
for me in the system.

239
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,783
Douglas, please.
This is my stuff, okay?

240
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:00,503
These are the units that Fuller
interacted with when he was there.

241
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,923
Maybe he wanted me to go in.

242
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,846
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking...

243
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,265
...don't even think about it.

244
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,475
I need your help.

245
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,019
No, no, no. I won't help you.

246
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,688
-It's a serious risk.
-I have to get in.

247
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,108
You could die.

248
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,069
The cops think I killed him.

249
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,823
They may be right.

250
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,493
-What do you mean?
-Everything points to me.

251
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,583
To be perfectly honest,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

252
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,130
Either I did murder Fuller and
I can't remember, or I'm being framed.

253
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,217
The one clue I have is in that machine.

254
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,512
I need your help
if I'm going to find it.

255
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,353
I'll set it for an hour.

256
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,400
Set it for 120 minutes.

257
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,860
Sixty is better.

258
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,529
120 minutes, Whit.

259
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,156
60 is safer.
I'm setting it at 60.

260
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,700
1-2-0.

261
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,005
120 minutes. Engage timer.

262
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,366
Mr. Grierson,
117 West Winston, Pasadena....

263
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,214
Transference beginning.

264
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,176
Download complete.

265
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,188
--five cents!

266
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,079
You owe me 12 dollars
and five cents.

267
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,124
Listen, young man!

268
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,876
I do not have all day!

269
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,633
Ferguson, anything wrong?

270
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,552
John, are you okay?

271
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,866
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Someone will be right with you.

272
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,356
Oh, my God.

273
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,414
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks. Don't smoke.

274
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,959
Since when?

275
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,045
Listen, John...

276
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,381
...why don't you....

277
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,467
Why don't you break for lunch?

278
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,678
Get some fresh air.

279
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,723
You look terrible.

280
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,650
I think I look pretty good.

281
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,753
Extra! Extra!
Zeppelin blast kills 35!

282
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,759
You want one, mister?
It's five cents.

283
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,601
Hey, watch out, buddy!

284
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,279
-How much to Pasadena?
-90 cents.

285
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,783
-If I forget to turn the meter on.
-I understand.

286
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,761
This is it, 117 Winston.

287
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,223
-Do you mind waiting?
-It'll be a pleasure, sir.

288
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,665
-Tell me if you need any help.
-Thank you.

289
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,388
You own this place?

290
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,350
I mean, it's not much...

291
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,436
...but it's mine.

292
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,613
You looking for anything
in particular?

293
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,908
Interested in a scientist.

294
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,203
Wrote a couple of books...

295
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,332
...about semiconductors...

296
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,960
...and the limitations
of the 64-bit microchip.

297
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,920
Microchip.

298
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,339
Semiconductors.

299
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,383
What year?

300
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,053
Early '70s?

301
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,139
His name was Hannon Fuller.

302
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,016
Hannon Fuller.

303
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,351
1870.

304
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,898
No, I can't say I've ever heard of...

305
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:21,444
...Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.

306
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:26,282
But I'm not much of a
technical person, you know.

307
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,498
You been here before?
You look kind of familiar.

308
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,334
Name's Douglas Hall.

309
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,633
It doesn't ring a bell.

310
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,262
Guess you just have
one of those faces...

311
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,890
...familiar faces.
Oh, it's late.

312
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,643
I'd like to close up now.

313
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,645
Of course.

314
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,941
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hall.

315
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,979
1257 Palo Alto Road,
La Cienega Heights.

316
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,814
I guess that's it.

317
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,238
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

318
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,823
What do you want her for?

319
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:53,661
-I want to ask her some questions.
-She got a job now. I'm her mother.

320
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,871
Can you tell me
where I can find her?

321
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,957
You a copper?

322
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,711
Now, listen.

323
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,505
She ain't doing
nothing wrong no more.

324
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,966
If you don't cause her no trouble...

325
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,052
...you'll find her
at Wilshire Grand Hotel.

326
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,984
Welcome to the Wilshire Grand Hotel.

327
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,790
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

328
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,584
She's over there,
second from the end.

329
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:30,925
Bridget?

330
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,763
I got your name from
a good friend of mine.

331
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,224
Come back later.
I'm really busy right now.

332
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,517
His name's Fuller.

333
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:44,438
The manager's very tough on us.
You'll have to wait till I'm off duty.

334
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,901
I really don't think
I can wait that long.

335
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,655
Go talk to Ashton over at the bar.

336
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,452
Bridget, do we have
your attention now?

337
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,913
Thank you. Let's go.

338
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,125
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ashton.

339
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,876
Right there.

340
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,754
Ashton, some guy wants you.

341
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,466
You're a lucky man.
I just opened.

342
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,472
Oh, my. Something wrong?

343
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,935
Bridget just sent me over here.

344
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,979
What can I do you for?

345
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,774
You know a gentleman
named Hannon Fuller?

346
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,528
Gin martini up, one olive and
likes them frigid as an Eskimo.

347
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,614
-Talk to him recently?
-Why?

348
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,451
I'm his friend.
He didn't come home last night...

349
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,829
...and his wife is concerned.
My name is Douglas Hall.

350
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,129
Concerned wives?

351
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,423
I can't help you with that.

352
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,508
How about something fancy?

353
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,677
So did....

354
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,388
Does Fuller come here frequently?

355
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,890
You could say that.

356
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,141
What does he do?

357
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,394
What everybody does:
drinks, dances, has a good time.

358
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,730
Especially has a good time.

359
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,982
He really goes for the girls.

360
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,026
Girls?

361
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,154
Thought you said you knew him.

362
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,823
Yeah, I thought I did.

363
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,161
Are you in a hurry or something?

364
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:26,290
Did you happen to talk to Fuller
the night before last?

365
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,250
Yes, I did.

366
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,254
Did he mention my name?
Did he give you something for me?

367
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,631
What would that be?

368
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,550
-A message or a note, maybe.
-No, sorry.

369
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,178
Did you see him talking
to anybody else?

370
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,680
I'm a very busy man.

371
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,022
Listen...

372
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,026
...if you like, I can arrange
something for you too.

373
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,030
You see anything you want?

374
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,583
Can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

375
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,186
Timer engaged and counting.

376
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,931
Douglas Hall! Hey, man!

377
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,850
You all right?

378
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,146
You sure?
All right, take it easy.

379
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,942
Hey, man. Take it easy.

380
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,446
I told you, 120 minutes.

381
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,741
It's too long.
You're really pushing your luck.

382
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,952
I need something to drink.
Some water.

383
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,458
Mr. Hall, you forgot
your coat and hat.

384
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,678
Name's Ferguson.
Johnny Ferguson.

385
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,353
Anything wrong?

386
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,230
Didn't finish your drink.

387
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,901
-What happened?
-What happened?

388
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,570
The memory transference
with your link...

389
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,697
...it froze.
Started overlapping!

390
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,494
Thought I'd be shooting hoops
with Ferguson forever.

391
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,829
You got a smoke?

392
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,623
Sure.

393
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,792
Thank you.

394
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,384
Mind if I ask you a question?

395
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,304
Can you tell me where I am?

396
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,476
It works?

397
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,229
Oh, it works!

398
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,233
It works.

399
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,777
How about Ashton?

400
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,030
-My bartender?
-He's got a better haircut than you.

401
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,532
Much better.

402
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,285
I wish I could see it for myself.

403
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,039
How's the lighting? Textures?

404
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,918
Colorization needs work,
but the units don't notice.

405
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,128
What are they like?

406
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,590
They're as real as you and me.

407
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,429
You see, the old man was right!
All those years of work!

408
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,390
Did you find out
what he was doing there?

409
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,934
He was having sex with girls.

410
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,563
You're kidding me.

411
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,315
Excuse me, Mr. Hall?

412
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,152
A man in the lobby says
he needs to talk to you.

413
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,071
Thanks. Have him call
my office in the morning.

414
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,450
He says it's urgent.
That he's a friend of Fuller's.

415
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,427
So, you're a friend of Fuller's.

416
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,138
You're Hall, right?

417
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,639
How can I help you, Mr....

418
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,475
Tom Jones.

419
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,977
You know, like the singer.

420
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,273
How about some privacy?

421
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,901
What do you want to talk about?

422
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,862
About the night the old man died.

423
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,784
I'll be right back, Joe.

424
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,003
So where'd you meet Fuller?

425
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,005
In my bar the other night...

426
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,882
...waiting for you.

427
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,638
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

428
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,309
No, I want to talk about money now.

429
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,021
-Something in the seven figures.
-What money?

430
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,690
Come on.

431
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,236
You think you can
get away with it?

432
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,612
Get away with what?

433
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,246
You took the old man, asshole!

434
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,916
Listen to me.
He was at the bar.

435
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,461
You pick him up, leave together.
Next day he's an obit.

436
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,672
You do the math, asshole!

437
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,515
Oh, Jesus!

438
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,645
Crazy son of a bitch!

439
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,982
You're nuts.

440
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,861
I'll see you on
America's Most Wanted.

441
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,048
Omni Hotel.
How can I help you?

442
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,426
Miss Jane Fuller, please.

443
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,305
Hello? Who is this?

444
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,769
On the night
your father was killed...

445
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,022
...he tried to reach me.

446
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,024
He wanted to meet at some bar.

447
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,609
What for?

448
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,861
He felt someone was after him.

449
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,738
Did you talk to him?

450
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,950
I know how strange this sounds.

451
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,285
I can't remember.

452
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,621
What do you mean?

453
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,667
Did you talk to
the detective about this?

454
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,378
No, but the bartender will...

455
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,089
...if I don't pay up.

456
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,133
Christ!

457
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,886
I know how crazy this sounds.

458
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,097
You can't just plug your brain
into this machine...

459
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,308
...and not expect
to be affected by it.

460
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,189
Please walk away from this
before you get hurt too.

461
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,652
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

462
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,573
Maybe we have, in another life.

463
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,410
What about Paris?
What's that other life like?

464
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,413
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Why not?

465
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,959
I guess I don't want you
to lose interest in me.

466
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,921
Don't worry about that.

467
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,842
Let's dance.

468
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,428
-Me? No, no.
-Yes, come on.

469
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,764
I buy all my shoes in left pairs.

470
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,517
It's easy.
I'll show you the steps.

471
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,495
You're doing pretty good
for a man with no right foot.

472
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,040
Must've picked it up in another life.

473
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,096
You know that feeling you have
that we met before?

474
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,562
It's the same with me.

475
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,022
Why is that?

476
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,483
They say that déjà vu
is usually a sign of...

477
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,403
...love at first sight.

478
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,238
Go, go. Ready!

479
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,535
Don't make any sudden moves.

480
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,913
What's this all about?

481
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,831
What it's usually all about.

482
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,666
Murder.

483
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,377
Is that your car?

484
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,837
-Those are my plates.
-No shit.

485
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,007
That's from a security camera
in your office garage...

486
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,010
-...the night Fuller was killed.
-I don't understand.

487
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,970
That makes one of us.

488
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,392
Fuller wanted to shut down the project,
and you sliced him up.

489
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,018
It's time I call my attorney.

490
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,395
You say you left at 10.

491
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,688
I was working late with Whitney.

492
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,649
Anybody with you?

493
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,698
You're picking up bad habits
left and right.

494
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,786
Must be the stress.

495
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,704
Then you'll need a carton.

496
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:55,001
Name's Tom Jones. Said he saw
your picture in the paper.

497
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:59,423
Said you looked like the guy
Fuller left the bar with that night.

498
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,385
We took his statement.
Said we'd be in touch.

499
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,263
Somebody reached out
and touched him first.

500
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,619
Looks like you found an alibi.

501
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,172
You're free to go...

502
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,007
...for now.

503
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:49,806
What did you tell him?

504
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,391
The truth.

505
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,102
We met for a drink,
one thing led to another...

506
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,814
...we spent the night together.
Your picture was on the news.

507
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,775
He saw you and thought
you were good for quick cash.

508
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,612
You should've seen the pictures.
The guy was slaughtered.

509
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,406
He was an ex-con.
Who knows what else he did!

510
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,285
Just because I don't remember it
doesn't mean I didn't do it.

511
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,912
You're not a killer.

512
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,831
Your father stumbled onto something.

513
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,667
He left me a message
having something to do with this.

514
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,669
So what are you going to do?

515
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,838
Jack back in and find out.

516
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,808
Downloading.
Time: Two hours.

517
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,394
Engage timer.

518
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,940
Timer not engaged. Warning!

519
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,443
Timer not engaged.

520
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,903
Warning.

521
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,495
We're up next!

522
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,547
-Ready? Come on.
-What?!

523
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,927
What's wrong?

524
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,470
Come on, John!

525
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,141
What are you doing?

526
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,272
We're gonna be disqualified!

527
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,786
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot, chief.

528
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,095
Come on!

529
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,473
Grierson!

530
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,612
I'll call the police!

531
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,614
-I need to talk to you!
-I told you!

532
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,115
I'll call the police!

533
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,867
Listen. Listen!

534
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,536
I know why you pass out
from time to time.

535
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,873
I know why you wake up
and have no idea where you are.

536
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,001
What'd you do three nights ago?
Any idea?

537
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,758
When did it first happen?

538
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,217
First time?

539
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,846
About four weeks ago.

540
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,807
And the last episode
was three nights ago?

541
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,311
It lasts for about two hours?

542
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,941
My wife thinks
I have a secret love life.

543
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,235
What about...

544
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,407
...memory flashes, déjà vu?

545
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,867
I was in World War I.

546
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:59,287
I'm still having these nightmares.

547
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,164
I'm talking about fantasies.

548
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,003
I do have them.

549
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,508
In these fantasies,
you're having sex with young girls.

550
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,265
When I wake up...

551
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,436
...I even have a perfume smell...

552
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,107
-...all over me.
-Real or imagined?

553
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,986
According to my wife...

554
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,448
...it's pretty real.

555
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,935
I found this...

556
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,187
...a couple of days ago.

557
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,439
Your size?

558
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,192
I am married over 35 years now.

559
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:16,990
And not once have I cheated
on my wife.

560
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,743
Not once.

561
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,370
Let's have a drink.

562
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,928
Warning.
Timer not engaged.

563
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,308
Warning.
Timer not engaged.

564
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,953
You been here before?

565
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:08,124
I can't afford places like this.

566
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,627
My treat.

567
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,716
Good evening, Mr. Fuller.

568
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,218
That's you.

569
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,096
Good evening.

570
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,518
-Nice to see you again.
-Good to see you too.

571
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:29,646
Members only.

572
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,982
-Mr. Fuller, your usual table?
-Of course.

573
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,235
He's with me.

574
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,737
May I help you with that?

575
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,629
Hi, honey bear.
I'll be with you in five minutes.

576
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,516
Let's talk, "honey bear."

577
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,825
You remember her?

578
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:27,120
Of course not.
She's mistaken me for someone else.

579
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,413
Your martini.

580
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,207
For someone else.

581
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,419
I want you to look around
and tell me what you remember.

582
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,837
I don't know.

583
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,840
I'd rather go home.
I don't feel very well.

584
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,510
You have the feeling
you've been here before?

585
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,513
Please try to remember.

586
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,516
Do you recognize anybody?

587
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:49,934
I'm trying.

588
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,820
Her?
What's her name?

589
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,700
I think her name....

590
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,914
Erika, I believe.
I believe her name is Erika.

591
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,165
Did you talk to her?

592
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,333
I'm not sure.

593
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,130
And that one looks familiar too.

594
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,594
Bridget.
Her name's Bridget!

595
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,599
Bridget. Oh, yes.

596
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,937
I remember Bridget.

597
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,439
Did you give her
something to give me?

598
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,025
Did you give her
a letter or a note?

599
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,738
The man behind the bar....

600
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,617
You're right.

601
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,954
I wrote a letter,
and I gave it to him.

602
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,413
To him!

603
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,595
You looking for
anything special?

604
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:53,850
What are you?

605
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,354
My name's Ferguson.

606
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,314
I'm a bank teller.

607
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,316
I'm Clark Gable.

608
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:05,278
I talked to the Ferguson guy.

609
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,779
He doesn't know a thing.

610
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,448
I need to talk to Fuller.

611
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,284
-He's upstairs.
-Cut the crap!

612
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:16,122
You think I don't know what's
going on? I need to talk to him again.

613
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,415
You read the letter.

614
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,294
I need to know what's in it.

615
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,213
Everything.

616
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,675
When I read it,
I thought it was a gag.

617
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,719
The world's a sham.
Fat chance!

618
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,472
But I'm not stupid, Mr. Hall.

619
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,559
I watched you and Ferguson
do the old switcheroo.

620
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,645
That stuff about going to
"the ends of the earth."

621
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,773
What stuff?

622
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,650
I did exactly
what the letter said.

623
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,778
I chose a place I'd never go to.

624
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,905
I tried to drive to Tucson.

625
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,698
I figured, what the hell.

626
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,201
Never been to the countryside.

627
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,204
And I took that car
out on the highway.

628
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,831
I was going over 50
through that desert.

629
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,793
After a while,
I was the only car on the road.

630
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,712
It was just me,
the heat and the dust.

631
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,964
I did exactly
what the letter said:

632
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,927
"Don't follow any road signs
and don't stop for anything.

633
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,804
Not even barricades."

634
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,021
But just when I should've been
getting closer to the city...

635
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,690
...something wasn't right.

636
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,193
There was no movement, no life.

637
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,030
Everything was still and quiet.

638
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,535
And then I got out of the car.

639
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,246
And what I saw...

640
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,792
...scared me to the depths...

641
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,919
...of my miserable soul.

642
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,506
It was true.
It was all a sham.

643
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,966
It ain't real.

644
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,301
Why would Fuller write about...

645
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,304
...the limitations of the simulation?
I know them.

646
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:57,014
I'm asking the questions!

647
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,851
I wanna know why.

648
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,271
Why would you put us through this?

649
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,815
Why are you fucking
with our minds?

650
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,860
-You weren't supposed to find out.
-Well, I did.

651
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,697
Now I want you to show me...

652
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,740
...what is real.

653
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,495
Is this real?

654
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,547
Is that real blood?

655
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,429
You like having
your life fucked with?

656
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,314
What the hell's going on?

657
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,900
Come on! Come on!

658
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,491
Where's the letter?

659
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,600
Snap out of it!

660
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,703
Not gonna hit me again, are you?

661
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:54,335
Did you yank me back?

662
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,296
Yeah, barely, man.
Just barely.

663
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:00,216
You didn't start the timer.
It couldn't engage.

664
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,802
What were you doing this
alone for anyway?

665
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,178
He tried to kill me.

666
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,888
-Who?
-Ashton.

667
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:07,598
Jesus!

668
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,894
He found out his world isn't real.
This is a mistake.

669
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,272
This whole project,
this experiment.

670
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,650
We are screwing with people's lives!

671
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,235
Now you're talking crazy.

672
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,238
I know you just had
a bad fucking trip--

673
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,864
"Bad fucking trip"?

674
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,491
"Bad fucking trip"?

675
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,079
These people are real.
They are as real as you and me.

676
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:31,956
Yeah, that's because...

677
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,417
...we designed them that way.

678
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,795
In the end, they're just
a bunch of electronic circuits.

679
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,296
Here's something else.

680
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,884
I'm shutting this
"bad fucking trip" right down.

681
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,513
-I'm telling everybody tomorrow.
-You can't do that.

682
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,265
You can't do that.

683
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,059
You're talking about
six years of our lives.

684
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,269
All of us.

685
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:57,106
You can't just
pull the plug and go home!

686
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,126
I'm looking for Jane Fuller.

687
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,921
Sorry, she's no longer with us.

688
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,298
The lady vanished.

689
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,719
Any idea where to?

690
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:30,639
Why would I?

691
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,850
Hannon Fuller doesn't have a daughter.

692
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,904
I think I made the age-old mistake:

693
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,573
"Never trust a beautiful woman."

694
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,867
Who is she, then?

695
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:51,619
We don't know.

696
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,289
It took us a couple of days
to contact the French authorities.

697
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,124
Guess what?

698
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,920
They never heard of her, either.

699
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,731
Do you remember me?

700
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,484
Miss Fuller checked out.

701
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,529
Did you drive her anywhere?
I'm looking for her.

702
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,073
No can do.
Company rules.

703
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:09,154
I'm Douglas Hall.
I'm looking for a young woman...

704
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,198
...named Jane Fuller.

705
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,535
I think you picked the wrong house.

706
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:18,706
Maybe she's going under
another name. She's about 5'8".

707
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,791
Blonde hair.

708
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,294
What do you want from her?

709
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,843
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Natasha Molinaro.

710
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,095
Over there on register four.

711
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,204
Here you go. Thank you.

712
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,756
$7.01.

713
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,936
Just slide it through.

714
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,408
You want cash back?

715
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,173
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

716
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,304
Must be déjà vu or something.

717
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,684
Paper or plastic?

718
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,394
Plastic.

719
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,233
There you go.

720
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:43,934
Mr. Hall!

721
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,736
You forgot your credit card.

722
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,324
Thanks.

723
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,993
No problem.

724
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:05,456
Sorry about staring at you in there.
You must get that a lot.

725
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,961
Yeah, but mostly from
the wrong kinds of guys.

726
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,091
You're not from here, are you?

727
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,677
What makes you ask?

728
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:19,970
Well, it's just....

729
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,183
I just had this funny feeling
that we met before.

730
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,104
Maybe in another life.

731
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,320
Yeah, I guess that would explain it.

732
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:43,076
Anyway, I gotta get back
to my daily grind, so....

733
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:46,830
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.

734
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:16,378
$7.28.

735
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:23,635
Out of 10. Here's your change.
Thank you very much.

736
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,599
Thank you.

737
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,312
Natasha Molinaro...

738
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,897
...27, single.

739
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,482
Changes jobs like
others change underwear.

740
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,904
Comes from Austin, Texas.
Made some money modeling.

741
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,864
Left school without a degree.

742
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,784
Her roommate has no idea
what she was doing yesterday.

743
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,079
Looks like Molinaro
doesn't have an alibi.

744
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,915
What else did the roommate say?

745
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,792
Says lately, Natasha
hasn't been feeling well.

746
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,754
She's been having
some sort of amnesia attacks.

747
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,174
Going out all night,
sleeping all day.

748
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,275
Thought she was using drugs.

749
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,486
She have a history of drugs?

750
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,112
Nope. She's clean.

751
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,240
Hey, Bernie?

752
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,535
-Good work.
-Thanks, Chief.

753
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,684
Look, I can explain.
I'm sorry.

754
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,062
I need to see you.
Meet me in Fuller's office.

755
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,897
I know the truth.

756
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,276
Where are you?

757
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,030
You could call it
the end of the world.

758
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,805
How many simulated worlds
like this are there?

759
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,557
Thousands.

760
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,894
Yours is the only one that ever created
a simulation within the simulation.

761
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,813
Something we never expected.

762
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,857
So you had to kill Fuller.

763
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,776
No. I was sent in after his death.

764
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,196
I was to pretend to be his daughter,
inherit the company...

765
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:50,824
...and shut it down.
But he tricked us.

766
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,702
He changed his will.

767
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,246
If you didn't kill Fuller...

768
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,915
...who did?

769
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,394
I stabbed him.

770
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,859
But it wasn't you.

771
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,196
It was your user.
He downloaded into you.

772
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,448
-Manipulated you.
-Like a puppet.

773
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,241
A puppet doesn't have a soul.

774
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,494
I can't have a soul
any more than Fuller.

775
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:36,787
But you do.

776
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,623
Fuller did.

777
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,792
I never expected that.

778
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:45,295
We programmed this world so no one
in it could learn the truth.

779
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:48,048
And you and Fuller did.

780
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,218
Don't you see what that means?

781
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,306
There's just one little flaw
in your thesis.

782
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,938
None of this is real.

783
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,942
You pull the plug...

784
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,236
...I disappear.

785
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,530
And nothing I ever say...

786
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,449
...nothing I ever do...

787
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,701
...will ever matter.

788
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,037
Why don't you find my user?

789
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,999
I'm sure he's a much better catch.

790
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,016
I told you about my other life.

791
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,477
I was referring to my husband.

792
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,565
He's your user.

793
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,943
He killed Fuller.

794
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,446
I'm his program link.

795
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,412
A reflection
of his character profile.

796
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,831
I fell in love with a decent man.

797
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,461
But he--
Something happened to him.

798
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:14,217
He began to use the simulation
as his own personal playground.

799
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,052
Like Fuller with the girls.

800
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:20,765
He made himself a god,
and it corrupted him.

801
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,728
He began to enjoy the killings.

802
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,064
-He became abusive.
-What do you mean?

803
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,442
He said he would kill me.

804
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,198
Why?

805
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,159
I fell in love with you.

806
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,080
You don't even know me.

807
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,000
Yes, I do.

808
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:54,424
From the moment the simulation
was created, I've watched you.

809
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,302
Your kindness...

810
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,305
...your integrity.

811
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:06,353
I fell in love with you
before I even met you.

812
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,105
How can you love me?

813
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,238
I'm not even real.

814
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,617
You can't fall in love with a dream.

815
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,754
You're more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

816
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,150
Preparing user for download...

817
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,236
...into simulation.

818
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:59,406
Program link ready for download.

819
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,741
Transference beginning.

820
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,285
Download complete.

821
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:12,919
Shit!

822
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:37,902
Shit!

823
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,912
Oh, wow!

824
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,679
Nice driving.

825
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,144
There was something in the road...

826
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,856
...and I had to swerve
and I lost control.

827
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:16,983
You drunk?

828
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,651
I don't drink.

829
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,487
License and registration.

830
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,786
Look, I didn't jack in--
I left it at home.

831
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,164
Why don't you look in the glove box?

832
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,758
Need a light?

833
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,676
Hey, I got it.

834
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,387
Here you go.

835
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,773
You ought to get this car looked at.

836
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,526
It's leaking oil.
That could be dangerous.

837
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:02,237
Be a little more careful, huh?

838
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:18,878
You want to turn off the car
and step out, please?

839
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,589
Turn off the car, sir.
Right now, please.

840
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,063
Open the trunk, please, sir.

841
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,035
Hands in the air.
Step away from the trunk.

842
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,371
Shit, man, it's Douglas!

843
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:54,789
Back up!

844
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,083
I said, back the hell up!

845
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,501
Hey, this is a joke!

846
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,004
Watch out!

847
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,266
Sorry to bother you...

848
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,769
...but Mr. Whitney's
in the building...

849
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:42,146
...and he's acting kind of strange.

850
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,399
I'll be right down.

851
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:12,885
Los Angeles Police Department.

852
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,929
This is Jane Fuller.

853
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:18,474
I need to speak
with Detective McBain.

854
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,688
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

855
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,857
Or should I say, "Miss Molinaro"?

856
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,150
How you doing?

857
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,070
All these pictures,
this is your world?

858
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,412
Ashton.

859
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,628
I never imagined
it could be so beautiful.

860
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:29,837
How'd you do it?

861
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:34,425
Last thing I remember,
I was dumping Ferguson in the trunk.

862
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,221
Son of a bitch!

863
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,683
He did it.

864
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,602
He jacked in.

865
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,730
Who's Jack?

866
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,200
What'd you do to the world?

867
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:03,204
-Turned it off.
-Well, put it back!

868
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:08,459
Don't do that!

869
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,338
Put it back!
What did I do?

870
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:19,262
Where are you?

871
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:31,774
Look at this.

872
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:35,153
You are really a god.

873
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,823
No, Ashton, I'm not really a god.

874
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,951
I'm just like you.

875
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,581
Just a bunch of electricity.

876
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,041
What are you talking about?

877
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:53,880
It's all smoke and mirrors.

878
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,758
Just like your world.

879
01:24:57,468 --> 01:25:00,470
We're nothing but a simulation
on some computer.

880
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,431
It's like a machine.

881
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,975
Like this arcade game.

882
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,270
You've got your players
and you put your nickel in.

883
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,606
This one pitches...

884
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,901
...this one runs around the bases.

885
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,487
You got a bat, you got a ball.

886
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,572
They play, they score.

887
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:23,409
Preprogrammed movements
generated by electrical energy.

888
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,037
We've improved
on this model since then.

889
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,956
Now the players can beat
the shit out of...

890
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,418
...and try to drown one another,
which is always fun.

891
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,712
But the letter said--

892
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:38,257
Everything was fake?
The letter was meant for me.

893
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,426
Fuller was talking about my world.

894
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,514
So what are you saying?

895
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:49,101
You're saying there's another world
on top of this one?

896
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,020
That's right.

897
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:57,360
-I don't understand.
-Fuller found out about it.

898
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:58,778
They killed him.

899
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,031
Why didn't they kill you?

900
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,325
Maybe they will.

901
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:07,578
Maybe that's why
you're pointing a gun at me.

902
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,164
I'm sorry, Ashton.

903
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,083
We're stuck here.

904
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,126
You and me...

905
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:17,046
...and the rest of us.

906
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,051
I want to see it.

907
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,096
-See what?
-My arcade game.

908
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,132
It's breathing.

909
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,895
So this is where I was born.

910
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,123
And this is where you die.

911
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,843
What are you doing?

912
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,470
Watching you dream.

913
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,143
How much longer do you have?

914
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,106
Ten minutes.

915
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:53,285
Hi, honey, I'm home.

916
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,746
Did you miss me?

917
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:00,626
David.

918
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,257
When did you download?

919
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,509
Obviously, not soon enough.

920
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,386
I was just doing my job.

921
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:12,304
Sure you were.

922
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,392
He's shutting down
the system, isn't he?

923
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,525
Aside from his devilish good looks...

924
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,070
...what's so special about this guy?

925
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,533
He reminds me of you.

926
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,578
-The way you used to be.
-I'm still the same.

927
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,246
No, you're not.

928
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,417
Why did you butcher those people?

929
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,672
Because it was fun.

930
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,176
You've lost your mind.

931
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,934
You're the one who's fucking sick!

932
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:02,104
Falling in love
with a fucking simulation.

933
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,398
I was just having some fun.

934
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,025
Just like you did.

935
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:10,529
I think you're lying.
Just remember, he's a part of me.

936
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:11,781
That's not true.

937
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:15,993
It's okay.

938
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,706
Just pretend you're fucking him.

939
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:01,974
Why?

940
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,852
I guess I'm just jealous.

941
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,133
You okay?

942
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:38,469
What the hell took you so long?

943
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:58,405
How'd you know he'd try to kill you?

944
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:02,451
I knew when he was
planning to download.

945
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:06,705
He's dead?

946
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:08,666
A bullet will do that to you.

947
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:25,182
So, is somebody gonna
unplug me now?

948
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,273
Do me a favor, will you?

949
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:35,359
When you get back to
wherever you come from...

950
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:38,153
...just leave us alone
down here, okay?

951
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,686
"June 21st, 2024."

952
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,274
Where am I?

953
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,405
Come, I'll show you.

954
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,191
Jane, we're getting hungry!

955
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,528
Tell Virginia we're waiting for lunch.

956
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,244
My father.

957
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,288
Fuller was modeled after him.

958
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,798
There's so many things
I have to tell you about, Doug.
