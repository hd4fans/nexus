131
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,578
不 只是懂一点
No, but Tweedledee and "Tweedledrunk" were bugging me, so

132
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,421
好的 你还记得自己的名字吗?      简
 Okay. Do you know your name?　　　　Jane.

133
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,722
简 我是凯文
Jane. I'm Kevin.

134
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,196
恩 谢谢你的帮忙
Hmm. Thank you for helping me.

135
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,199
没关系 站得起来吗?      哦
 Sure. Got it?　　　　 Uhhuh.

136
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,201
哦 你还好吗?      我很好
 Okay. You're good?　　　　 I'm fine.

137
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,722
那就好
All right.

138
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:24,399
还是给你找辆出租车吧
Whoa, whoa. Okay. Why don't we get you a cab?

139
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,377
放松点 我们走
All right. Nice and easy. Let's walk.

140
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,314
<i>我对你是</i>
# That I'm irresponsibly mad #

141
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,647
<i>如此狂热</i>
#For you ##

142
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,593
顺便说一句 我喜欢你的丁字裤
I loved your thong, by the way.

143
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,356
我看见你在车上换礼服了
You buzzed past me earlier. I saw you changing gowns.

144
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,864
你一个晚上参加了两个婚礼 是么?
You were in two weddings in one night, weren't you?

145
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:50,527
很烦人 你不觉得吗?      她们都是我好友
That's a little upsetting, don't you think?　　　　 They're both good friends...

146
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:54,073
但她们的婚礼在同一晚 我能怎么办?
and their weddings happened to be on the same night, so what was I supposed to do?

147
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,607
不 我不是这意思 你怎么受得了?
Oh, no. That's not the upsetting part. How do you stand it?

148
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,200
我是说 一个还不够糟吗?      我喜欢婚礼
 I mean, isn't one wedding bad enough?　　　　 I love weddings. I always have.

149
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,802
是吗?      是啊
 Really?　　　　 Yeah.

150
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,316
哪一部分 不情愿的结合
Which part, the forced merriment,

151
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,145
糟糕的音乐还是难吃的食物?
horrible music or bad food?

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,549
事实上 是遇上你这样的人
Actually, it's meeting upbeat people like yourself.

153
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:11,784
爱要有耐心 爱是仁慈的 爱意味着失去理智
Love is patient. Love is kind. Love means slowly losing your mind.

154
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,859
你是干什么的来着?      我是一个作家
 What is it you do again?　　　　 I'm a writer.

155
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,860
谁信你
Right.

156
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,822
我到了      我来付
 This is my building.　　　　 I got it.

157
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,834
不 我来付      你确定?
 No. I got it.　　　　 Sure?

158
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,097
对
Yeah.

159
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,571
140元 你知道自己都做了什么
All right, sweetie. A hundred and forty. You know what you did.

160
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,439
嘿！不 等一下 你要送他回去
Hey! What's No. He's gonna be right back. Hold on.

161
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,570
你不认为这一系列的典礼
Don't you think it's a whole lot of ritual for something that

162
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,844
面对现实吧 只是一半一半的几率
Let's face it It's got about a 5050 shot of making it out of the gate.

163
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,078
真新鲜 一个不相信婚姻的男人
How very refreshing. A man who doesn't believe in marriage.

164
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,654
我只是想说婚姻很伪善
 I'm just trying to point out the hypocrisy of the spectacle.

165
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,746
你好高尚啊 你是不是还会
That's so noble of you. Do you also go around...

166
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,757
告诉小孩子们圣诞老人其实不存在?
telling small children that Santa Claus doesn't exist?

167
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,759
因为总有人要揭穿这个谎言
'Cause someone needs to blow that shit wide open.

168
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:52,297
所以你相信婚姻 却不相信圣诞老人
So you admit that believing in marriage is kind of like believing in Santa Claus.

169
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,628
不 我...
No. I

170
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,902
我不知道我为什么和一个陌生人讨论这个
I don't know why I'm arguing this with a perfect stranger.

171
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:01,769
但是 婚姻像其他珍贵的事情一样很难得到
But, yes, marriage, like everything good and important, isn't easy.

172
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,604
圣诞老人是另一回事 一直都是
Cynicism, on the other hand, always is.

173
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,475
很高兴遇见你 再见
 It was very interesting meeting you.　　　　 Bye.

174
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,810
拜
Yeah.

175
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,941
下周末你还要参加很多婚礼吗?
You gonna be in more weddings next weekend?

176
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,383
我必须去      你参加过多少婚礼?
 I have to go.　　　　 How many have you been in, by the way?

177
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,320
像是舞会那种      晚安
 Just, like, ballpark.　　　　 Good night.

178
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,129
嘿！你能...      什么?
 Hey, you know what? Could you　　　　 Yeah?

179
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,032
没事了      哦
 Forget it.　　　　 Yup.

180
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:37,032
周六 凯恩的婚礼

181
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,032
周六 戴维的婚礼 

182
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,574
好的
Okay.

183
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,885
死亡 毁灭 婚礼版
Death. Destruction. Wedding vows. Yea.

184
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,021
让我好好看看
Come to mama.

185
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,263
哦
Oh.

186
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,418
那晚有人早退 你看到了吗?
Jeter hit a walkoff in the ninth. Did you see it?

187
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,548
哦 没有 我周六晚上去工作了 记得吗?
Uh, no. I work Saturday nights, remember?

188
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,628
为了那幸福的一对      是的
 Here. From the happy couple.　　　　 Oh, that's right.

189
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:07,028
你跑去吃椰子蛋糕 看幻灯片了
You were eating coconut cake and doing the Electric Slide.

190
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,124
婚礼怎样?      哦 我看看
 So how'd it go?　　　　 Oh, let's see.

191
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,726
新郎看到四散的玫瑰花瓣中向他走来的新娘
The bride wore a gown that sparkled like the groom's eyes...

192
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,137
眼睛就像新娘的礼服一样光彩照人
as he saw her approaching through a shower of rose petals.

193
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,471
你没和新娘上床?
And you're not getting laid?

194
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,841
结婚誓言是以承诺为准则的
Commitments is the gold standard of wedding announcements.

195
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,710
全世界女孩都迫不及待想看周日的婚礼版
Every girl on the planet rips open that page, first thing Sunday.

196
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,010
新娘们为了这个不惜一切代价
Brides kill to get in there.

197
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,144
你到底知不知道能得到多少好处?
Do you have any idea what you can be doin'?

198
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,449
对一个马上就要结婚的女人?      对
 You mean to women who are about to get married?　　　　 Yeah.

199
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,988
她们不会给你打电话 不会打扰你
They won't call you. They won't bother you.

200
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:34,737
甚至会假装没见过你 机会难得啊
They will pretend they never even met you. You can't beat that.

201
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:36,488
好吧 很快就不那么重要了
Well, it's not gonna matter much longer anyway.

202
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:40,300
你会在这本子上找到我的婚礼
 You're looking at my ticket out of the taffeta ghetto.

203
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,297
做你的白日梦吧
Keep on dreaming.

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,427
快走开     好吧
 Uh, go away.　　　　 Yes. Okay.

205
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,673
怎么了? 我才不会穿伴娘服来公司
What? I wasn't gonna come to work in my bridesmaid dress.

206
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,043
今天穿得挺高雅的啊
Twoday walk of shame outfit. Elegant.

207
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,048
昨天晚上你干嘛去了?
What happened to you the other night?

208
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,782
你根本就是人间蒸发了
You were barely there, and then you disappeared.

209
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,620
你遇见什么人了?      得了 没有
 You meet someone?　　　　 Come on. No.

210
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,694
哦 荒谬的问题
Oh. Ridiculous question.

211
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,031
吉娜 早上好
 Good morning, Gina.

212
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,829
你看到我的记事本了吗?      没有
 You haven't seen my Filofax anywhere, have you?　　　　 No.

213
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,961
好的 我自己去找找看
No. Okay. I'll go look for it.

214
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,905
你给乔治准备好那些文件了吗?      没有
 Did you get those catalog pages in for George?　　　　 No.

215
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,534
别担心 我去准备
Okay. No worries. I'll get them from production.

216
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,813
干得好 让她知道谁是老板
Attagirl. Show her who's boss.

217
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,349
我不是她的老板      你是老板的助手
 I'm not her boss.　　　　 You're the boss's assistant.

218
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,419
如果你不滥用权力 这工作还有什么意思?
Same diff. What's the good of your job if you can't abuse the power?

219
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,511
凯西 去算账本吧      你现在倒很专横
 Casey, go to Accounting.　　　　 Now you're bossy.

220
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:45,322
见鬼 我到底放哪了?
Where the hell did I put that thing?

221
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,229
这是个能上头版的构想
That is a great idea for the front page of the section.

222
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,859
哦 道尔 这是你第几次这么说了?
Oh, come on, Doyle. How many times have I heard this from you?

223
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,222
莫林 说真的 这是个很棒的构想
 I'm telling you, Maureen. It's a great idea.

224
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:52,938
真的吗?
Really?

225
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,999
跟你上个构想一样好? 
As great as your last great idea,

226
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:57,373
曝光漫天要价的婚礼蛋糕房?
an expose on pricefixing at wedding bakeries?

227
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,172
是啊！它们宰人啊 一点面粉就要那么多钱
Yes! Yes! They're ripping people off. Flour costs pennies per ounce.

228
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,645
80％的利润 太无耻了
That's an 8000/0 markup. It's outrageous.

229
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:04,909
的确是 但是没人在意
Yes, it is. Also, no one cares.

230
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,111
那上次我想写的缎带工厂剥削工人的事呢?
What about the piece I wanted to do on the exploitation of workers in lace factories?

231
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,121
那可是杀人啊      行了
 That is a killer piece.　　　　 Oh, right.

232
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,691
人们可真想看这样的时尚版块啊
That's what people really wanna read about in the Style section.

233
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:16,853
凯文 这个板块是我们赚钱的主力军
Kevin, this section practically pays for the entire paper.

234
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:20,228
我们的广告商要娱乐 有趣的人物故事
Our advertisers want fun, upbeat, colorful humaninterest stories...

235
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,550
跟你的想法相反
 opposite their products.

236
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,131
所以我们要帮他们赚钱?
So that's what we're about now? Making money?

237
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,966
出去      好的 听着 这样不对
 Get out.　　　　 All right. Listen. That was not right.

238
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,131
我明白 但这次 看 这个女人
I get it. But this one is. Look, this woman...

239
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,334
已经参加了七场婚礼      然后呢?
 has been in seven weddings　　　　 So?

240
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:34,209
光是今年 周六就参加了两场
This year. She was in two on Saturday alone.

241
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,474
不止是关于她
But it won't just be about her.

242
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,608
而是深刻的剖析婚礼产业如何把
It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding industry has transformed something...

243
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:43,985
重要的典礼转变为税收的流水线
that should be an important rite of passage into nothing more than a corporate revenue stream.

244
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,259
以一种愉快的 鼓舞人心的方式
In a fun, upbeat, you know, cheerful way.

245
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,887
听着 莫林 我在委托事项部都快郁闷死了
Look, Maureen, I am dying back there in Commitments.

246
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,816
再让我写半句关于满天星的报道
If I have to write another sentence about baby's breath,

247
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,092
我一枪崩了自己
I'm gonna shoot myself.

248
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,169
这才是真正的报道 才是我想做的
This is a real story. This is what I wanna do.

249
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,932
我要你继续报道婚礼 这才是你擅长的
I need you covering weddings. That's what you're good at.

250
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,007
也是我想让你做的
And that's what I need you to do.

251
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,736
如果你不让我写这个特别报道 我就辞职
If you don't start giving me feature stories, I'm gonna have to quit.

252
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,425
好吧 一次机会 如果我不喜欢
One chance. If I don't like it,

253
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,281
你就给我回委托事项部
you go back to Commitments for the rest of your life...

254
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:12,146
面带微笑的工作一辈子
with a big smile on that ridiculously handsome face of yours.

255
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,084
成交
Deal.

256
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,986
你认为他会喜欢这个?      是的
 You think he'll like these?　　　　 Yes, I do.

257
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:23,084
我认为这些照片会让乔治把你拉进他办公室
I think those photos for the fall catalog will cause George to take you into his office...

258
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:27,029
然后跟你甜蜜的大"战"几百回合
 and make sweet love to you for hours and hours.

259
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,830
你这么勤奋工作是因为你不开心
Tell me that crazy crush is the reason you work as hard as you do, 'cause it's upsetting.

260
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,456
我只是爱岗敬业 好吗?
Just like my job. Okay?

261
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,064
不 你希望有一天
No. You just think that one day...

262
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,987
乔治一早醒来发现自己疯狂的爱上了你
George is gonna wake up and realize that he is madly in love with you...

263
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,222
他还会表现出高姿态的爱恋
 and he's gonna make some spectacular gesture of love

264
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:40,374
给简・尼克斯的花
Flowers for Jane Nichols.

265
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,039
是我 谢谢
Yeah. That's me. Thank you.

266
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,113
太好了 我跟男人在床上滚了两天
That's great. I spent two days in bed with a guy,

267
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:48,153
你却收到了花
 and you get flowers.

268
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,313
太好了      没有卡片
 Nice.　　　　 There's no note.

269
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,650
简 你不会真认为是你梦中情人送来的吧
Oh,Jane. You don't seriously think they're from your dream guy, do you?

270
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,855
吉娜 你能帮我把花放在我桌上吗?
Gina, can you take these to my desk for me?

271
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,329
没问题      谢谢
 Sure. No problem.　　　　 Thank you.

272
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,731
你能不说这个了吗? 没人知道
Would you please stop saying that? Nobody knows.

273
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,860
所有人都知道 除了乔治
Everybody knows,Jane, except George.

274
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,404
是真的
It's true.

275
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:11,875
卡西 嗨 小家伙 嗨
Gatsby! Hi, buddy. Hi!

276
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,844
过来 卡西 别对着女士流口水
Whoa! Come on, Gatsby. No slobbering on the ladies.

277
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,040
嗨 
Hi.

278
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:22,420
旅行还好吗?      很不错 
 How was it?　　　　 It was phenomenal. Up and back...

279
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,999
我刚刚度过了最好的10个小时
in 10 hours our best time yet.

280
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,915
这是你第8次上惠特尼山吗?
Isn't that, like, the eighth time you climbed Mount Whitney?

281
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,154
你怎么记得 简?      我也不知道
 How do you remember that stuff,Jane?　　　　 I don't know.

282
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,237
我们刚收到这个 你认为怎么样?
 So we just got these in. What do you think?

283
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,754
我觉得没有整体感
I think they're too corporate.

284
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,494
我也这么想 它们的感觉不够...
That's what I was thinking. They don't have enough of a feel of being

285
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,832
户外 我是说 没有冒险
Outdoors. Right. I mean, there's no adventure.

286
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,429
或是危机的感觉 这些人太矫揉造作了
There's no danger. Plus, everyone looks way too put together.

287
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,770
是啊 像模特 明白了 我会跟营销部说的
Yeah. Like models. Got it. I will talk to Marketing.

288
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,776
看吧 这就是我为什么留你在身边
See? That's why I keep you around,Jane.

289
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,176
谁能像你一样了解我的心思呢?
I mean, who else could finish my sentences?

290
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,180
你的设计会议在11点
Your design meeting is at 11:00.

291
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,251
然后在92号街有一个福利会议
And the 92nd Street Y called to confirm that you'll be attending their benefit.

292
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,320
你想去吗?      要演讲吗?
 You wanna go?　　　　 Do I have to make a speech?

293
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,549
说几句关于生态责任的商务实践活动

296
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:05,126
我得空出一天 对吧?
but I'm probably gonna need to dig up a date for that, huh?

297
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,927
也许吧      至少这是我生活里唯一不用
 Yeah. Probably.　　　　 At least that's the one thing in my life...

298
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,934
你来关照的事 对吗?      对
you don't have to take care of for me, right?　　　　 Yeah.

299
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,201
哦 我的老天
Oh, my... God!

300
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,367
别说了      简！
 Leave me alone.　　　　 Jane!

301
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,378

Yeah?　　　　 Did you put that breakfast burrito on my desk?

302
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,380
我怕你会饿
I just thought you might be hungry.

303
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,575
这就是我爱你的原因
That's why I love ya.

304
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,650
我也爱你
I love you too.

305
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:32,952
哦！打得好
Oh! Yeah.

306
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,083
是 你是对的 我需要清醒一下
Yeah. You're right. I needed that.

307
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:39,628
好了 各位 
Okay, everybody.

God! Wouldn't it be great if there was a service that you could hire to do that?

317
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:08,150
黄色的计程车或是黑轿车...
Like yellow cars or shiny black sedans

318
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,251
我想亲自去接她 她是我妹妹

Rudolfo said he wanted to come back to New York with me, of course...

328

329
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,428

离开6个月实在太久了

333
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,955
妈妈那时跟我现在一样大

我不想让他认为我没有责任感

You're wrong. George appreciates me for the way I am.

382
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:34,788
谁会欣赏一个穿着衣服的女人
What good is it being appreciated if no one is naked?

383
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
嘿 简 顺便问一下

 Okay? It was great.　　　　 Okay. Good. Good.

387
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:52,144

'Cause, you know, we haven't really had that kind of relationship before...

388
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:55,379
所以我要确定一下是否可以这么做

你现在就去告诉他你的感觉
You have to go over there and tell him how you feel.

393

机会只有一次 所以...

It's kind of like whatever I need, she takes care of.

402
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:09,417
好像我不能没有她一样
As if I don't take enough advantage of her already...

403
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,622
我今早甚至在她桌上留下了干洗的收据

449
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,771
太奇怪了 我永远都不会那样
That's freakin' insane. I could never do that.

450

<i>透过水气望过去</i>
#And I look across the water #

464
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:07,630
<i>我想着你做过的所有事情</i>
#And I think of all the things what you're doin'#

465
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:11,294

466
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,298
<i>因为每次我回到家</i>

# Why don't you come on over, Valerie ##

473
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:37,155

他一直在说我?

475
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,022
别灰心 我是他生命里重要的一部分

482
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:05,853
哦！      对你来说很奇怪吗?
 Ow!　　　　 Is that weird for you?

483
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:09,620
奇怪? 怎么会? 他只是我老板 我才不在乎
What? Weird? Why would it be weird? He's my boss. I don't care. Whatever.

484
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:11,253
哦 太好了 我们明天要一起吃午餐
 Okay. Great. 'Cause we're having lunch tomorrow.

485

太好了
That's so great!

486
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:15,600
是啊 我也这么想 你没必要这么小题大做
Yeah. I think so too. Except not quite at that decibel.

487
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,663
跟我说说乔治吧
So tell me about George.

488
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,969
哦 好吧
Oh. Well. I

489
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,779
他 厄...
Uh, he, uh

490
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:31,872
大学辍学了
Well, he dropped out of college...

491
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:35,282
然后登遍了世界上的每座名山
and then climbed every major peak in the world.

492
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,355
他在30岁以前就脚踏实地的把一个
And then he started Urban Everest from his apartment...

493
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:41,187
生态商业企业建立成了
and turned it into one of the most ecofriendly philanthropic businesses in the world

494
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:42,550
世界上的珠穆朗玛峰
all before he was 30.

495
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,813
哇哦      是啊 
 Wow.　　　　 Yeah.

496
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:44,613
这只是他的简介
And that's just his resume.

497
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:48,230
他是个难以置信的老板 每个人都爱他  
He is an unbelievable boss. Everybody loves him. Everybody.

498
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,927
他爱他的狗胜过一切
And he loves his dog, Gatsby, more than anyone.

499
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,163
他不吃红肉 这挺好
He doesn't eat red meat, which is kinda cool.

500
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:57,002
宁愿花所有的时间呆在户外
And he would rather spend all his time outside than anywhere else.

501
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:59,509
天啊 听起来真不可思议
My God. He sounds amazing.

502
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,274
是的 但是他也有缺点
Yeah. Yeah, but he has flaws. He does.

503
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:06,282
人无完人嘛
He is flawed.

504
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:10,912
什么意思?      他讨厌现金
 What do you mean?　　　　 Well, he hates cashews...

505
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,990
这很奇怪
which is weird.

506
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,151
有时他还光着脚穿鞋
And sometimes he doesn't wear socks with sneakers.

507
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,456
我觉得很恶心
I just think that's gross.

508
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,623
简 有什么毛病会妨碍我俩的好事吗?
Jane.Jane, those aren't exactly dealbreakers.

509
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,964
好事 什么好事?
Deal. WhWhat deal?

510
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,870
今晚你们之间什么都没发生 是吧?
I mean, nothing happened between the two of you tonight, did it?

511
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:31,534
是吗?      这个嘛
 Did it?　　　　 Well.

听起来真有趣
Sounds fun.

515
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:48,850
爸爸?      哦 嘿 亲爱的
 Dad?　　　　 Oh, hey, sweetie.

516
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,985
你好吗? 你不必...
How are you? Oh, you didn't have to

517
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:55,465
泰斯 哦...
Tessie! Oh! Oh!

518
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,001
嗨      看看你      
 Hi.　　　　 Look at you.

519
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:02,039
爸爸 这地方看起来一点也没变
Oh, Dad. This place looks exactly the same.

520
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,040
这不公平
Now that's not fair.

521
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:08,135
我弄了个新遮阳棚 做了木匠活 看啊
I got a brandnew awning. I just stripped and revarnished all the woodwork. Look.

522
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:10,544
新的收音机 数码的      哦
 New cash register. Digital.　　　　 Oh.

523
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,209
爸爸 抱歉 我不知道我错过了这么多
Wow, Dad. I'm sorry. I don't know how I missed all these...

524
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,218
值得纪念的进展
remarkable improvements.

525
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,880
给我那个      我们上楼吧
Give me that. Let's go upstairs.

526
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,681
好了
There we go.

527
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:23,022
爸爸 我们吃这个会不会太小孩子气？
Dad, aren't we a little old for these?

528
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,358
才不会   太好了 我超爱吃这个!
 No.　　　　 Good, 'cause I love 'em!

529
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:28,523
泰斯 你准备在这里待多久?
So, Tess, how long you here for?

530
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,336
一到两周 对吧? 你是这么说的
One to two weeks, right? That's what you said.

531
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:36,533
啊 事实上得视情况而定
Um, actually, it just depends on how a few things pan out.

532
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,542
什么情况?
What things?

533
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:42,738
什 什 什么情况?
WhatWhatWhat few things? What's

534
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:50,213
你好 嗨!      让我猜猜
 Hello? Hi!　　　　 Let me guess.

535
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,449
又有男人追她了?
Some new guy is chasing after her?

536
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:56,721
我不会说是人家"追她"
I wouldn't call it "chasing."

537
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,764
哦 乔治 我愿意      简?
 Oh, George. I would love to.　　　　Jane?

538
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:03,060
什么?      你还好吗?
 What?　　　　 You okay?

539
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:06,729
是的! 哦 是的 我很好 没事
Yeah! Oh, yeah. Great. Fine. Everything's fine.

540
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:13,271
当然
Of course.

541
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,248
我得停下来
I gotta stop.

542
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,488
凯文・道尔

543
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,925
她会给我打电话的 我保证
She's gonna call me. I guarantee it.

544
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,112
我有办法让女人自己找上门
 I got a way of making the ladies reach out to me.

545
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:30,484
哦是吗 啥办法?
Oh, yeah. How?

546
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,329
哦 上帝啊
Oh, God.

547
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:40,503
呜! 你好呀
Whoo! Ah. "Yello."

548
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:43,233
你撕走了我一个星期的日程安排 你疯了?
You ripped a week out of my planner. Are you insane?

549
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:47,175
做个小实验 看看没有那些安排你要怎么活
It's a little experiment. See how you do without every second of your life mapped out.

550
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,474
顺便说一下 你的生活才疯狂呢
By the way, your life is insane.

551
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,742
你除了工作和帮别人结婚还做什么?
What do you do besides work and help people get married?

552
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,318
知道吗? 我认为这跟你无关
You know what? I don't see how that's any of your business.

553
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,319
这么多婚礼你怎么忙得过来?
How do you afford these weddings?

554
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,946
我是说婚姻俱乐部的礼服 飞机票和酒水?
I mean, the dresses, the airfares, the wine of the month clubs?

555
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,082
嘿 人们喜欢那儿的赠品 我还是俱乐部常客
Hey, people love that gift. And I'm a frequent member.

556
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:03,922
有时候会给我免费礼物
So sometimes they throw in a free gewurztraminer.

557
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,725
哇 太可悲了 我真为你难过
Wow. That is terribly sad. I'm sorry about that.

558
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,696
啊 瞧 我想补偿你一下
Ah. Well, look. I wanna make it up to you.

559
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,860
好吗? 买个新记事本还是来个约会?
Okay? How about a new date book or maybe just a date?

560
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,029
啊 好 当然 让我记到日程表里
Uh, yeah. Sure. Let me just pencil you in.

561
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:15,613
可是 嘿! 你已经写下来了
Except, hey! You already did.

562
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,267
今年的每个星期六都是你
Every Saturday for the rest of the year.

563
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,674
知道吗? 您能不能找别人去?
You know what? Can you please, please find someone else to be creepy with?

564
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,577
不能 告诉你 任何时候...
Nope. Tell you what. Anytime you wanna hang out with somebody...

565
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:26,515
你不想再陪别人进试衣间或去尝蛋糕...
who doesn't need you to take them to a fitting or a caketasting...

566
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:29,109
或者彩排婚宴 给我打个电话就好
or a coed mojito and burrito rehearsal dinner, just give me a call.

567
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,314
才怪 行了
Yeah. Okay.

568
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:34,790
哦 上帝呀
Oh, God.

569
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,328
嘿!      嘿!
 Hey!　　　　 Hey!

570
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,524
还让抱抱吗?      当然
 Are we getting too old for hugs?　　　　 No.

571
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,601
谢谢
Thank you.

572
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,670
他在那呢
There he is.

573
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,364
佩德罗 你好吗?      嘿 你好吗?
 Pedro. How's it goin'?　　　　 Hey, what's up?

574
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:52,933
佩德罗是我的 厄...      我是他弟弟
 So Pedro is my, uh　　　　 I'm his little brother.

575
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:56,013
我参加了青年中心的兄弟项目
From the Big Brother Program at the Y.

576
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:59,982
哦      佩德罗 泰斯碰巧是简的妹妹
 Oh.　　　　 Pedro, Tess happens to be Jane's sister.

577
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:03,646
哦      你好 佩德罗
 Oh.　　　　 Hola, Pedro.

578
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:08,566
对了 简 我和泰斯...
Yeah. Um, look,Jane, Tess and I...

579
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:11,558
正要带佩德罗去参加棒球比赛 你想不想来
are gonna take Pedro to his baseball game if you wanna join us.

580
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:14,063
不行 我有工作要做 我得留在这里
I can't. I've got so much work to do. I should stay here.

581
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,395
你开玩笑吧 简? 瞧 你的上司可是个混蛋
Are you kidding me,Jane? Look, your boss is a jerk anyhow.

582
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,368
不想被炒鱿鱼就一起来吧      好吧
 Let's go. I don't wanna have to fire you.　　　　 Okay.

583
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:22,406
好吗? 好的 走吧
All right? All right. Let's go.

584
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:27,581
嘿 你好吗?   还好
 Hey. How you doin'?　　　　 All right.

585
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:31,515
我要3杯无糖百事 3份薯条还有...
Let me get three Diet Pepsis, three fries and

586
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,050
辣热狗 你要辣热狗吗?      哦 不
 Chili dog. You want a chili dog?　　　　 Uh, no.

587
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,175
除非是没有肉辣酱的豆腐热狗
 Not unless it's a tofu dog with meatless chili.

588
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,054
对不起 什么?
I'm sorry. What?

589
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,920
你是素食主义者?      是啊 最近才开始
 You're a vegetarian?　　　　 Uhhuh. It's recent.

590
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:43,960
哦 是吗?      知道吗? 我也吃素
 Oh, is it?　　　　 You know, 'cause I'm a vegetarian too.

591
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:46,553
我曾是严格的素食主义者 但那太难受了
I used to be a vegan, but it was too much of a hassle.

592
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,929
哦 我知道 我是说当素食者也是种挑战
Oh, God. I know. I mean, even being a vegetarian is a challenge.

593
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,936
我是说 每次徒步旅行我都得带自制便当
I mean, every time I go hiking, I have to bring my homemade "to furky jerky."

594
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:56,700
你徒步旅行吗? 我是说 无意冒犯...
You go hiking? I mean, no offense...

595
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,868
但你看起来不像那种会远足的女孩...
but you hardly seem like the kind of girl that hits the trails

596
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,969
尤其是看你穿的鞋
Especially in those shoes.

597
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,243
猫咪高跟鞋的公关说它们最适合远足了
The best "to furky" is made by publicists in kitten heels.

598
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,046
我明白你那么想的原因 事实上我热爱...
I can see how you would think that, but I actually love...

599
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:10,053
所有户外运动...
all that outdoorsy type of stuff

600
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:13,921
你知道 远足 单车 攀岩之类的
You know, hiking and biking and climbing up things.

601
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:15,488
但说实话 
But, to tell you the truth,

602
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,725
自从我的狗死掉之后 我好久没远足了
I haven't been hiking sinceWell, since my dog died.

603
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,425
我和简看着它长大的 它叫托利
See Jane and I had this dog growing up, Tory.

604
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,434
我好好... 爱它哦
I just I loved him.

605
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:29,769
它过去常跟我一起远足或是攀爬冒险
He would just go on nature hikes and climbing adventures.

606
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:34,106
我没有一天不想念那条满身跳蚤的家伙
Not a day goes by that I don't think about that bag of fleas.

607
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:37,113
哦 老托利
Good ol' Tory.

608
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,309
简 你怎么从来没提过托利?
Jane, how come you never mentioned Tory?

609
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:41,488
我不知道
I don't know.

610
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:44,855
也许因为我把对"托比"的回忆藏在心底吧
I must have repressed the memory of Toby.

611
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,300
对 它叫"托比" 
Yeah. His name was "Toby,"

612
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,291
我小时候口齿不清所以叫它"托利"
but I called him "Tory" because I had a lisp.

613
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:54,593
口齿不清到能把"比"说成"利"?
A lisp that turned your "B's" to "R's"?

614
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,633
知道吗? 我小时候有口吃
You know what? When I was a kid, I had a stutter.

615
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,702
不会吧!
No way!

616
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:01,931
没想到我们共同点这么多      我也没想到
 We have more things in common than I thought.　　　　 Yeah, me too.

617
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,678
我要去陪佩德罗"打苍蝇"了
I'm gonna go out and shag some flies with Pedro.

618
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:13,376
哦! 我好羡慕 听起来好有趣哦
Ooh! I'm jealous. It sounds fun.

619
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,686
什么是"打苍蝇"?      你在干什么?
 What are "shagging flies"?　　　　 What are you doing?

620
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,382
怎么了?      你讨厌狗 豆腐和户外运动
 What?　　　　 You hate dogs and tofu and being outside.

621
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:23,427
才不 我喜欢游艇 鲜花和晒太阳
No. I like yachts. I like flowers. I like, you know, tanning.

622
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:24,456
虽然不完全是同类事物...
 I mean, it's not exactly the same

623
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:26,361
你从来就讨厌托比
And you hated Toby.

624
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,490
你恨它 你根本不喜欢动物
You hated him. The only animals you ever cared about are dead ones with sleeves.

625
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:33,594
你说那些话只因为乔治很...迷人
You're just saying all this stuff because George is so... attractive.

626
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,697
至少有人这么认为      我并不讨厌托比
 Or some people think he is.　　　　 I did not hate that dog.

627
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,708
只要它不缠着我
I just hated it when he slobbered on me.

628
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,406
如果我努力的话说不定也会喜欢豆奶和远足
And I could like soy milk and hiking if I tried it. Maybe.

629
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,175
嘿 泰斯 过来好吗 让我见识一下你的臂力
Hey, Tess. What do you say you come out here. Let's see that arm.

630
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:51,687
哦 有趣 我们现在要打了吗?
Ooh. Fun. Are we gonna shag now?

631
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,419
以前打过吗?      没 我不知道怎么玩
 Ever done this before?　　　　 No. I don't know how to do this.

632
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:59,156
这样      好的 像这样?
 Here you go.　　　　 Okay. Like that?

633
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,858
把胳膊放下面 好吗? 胳膊肘朝上
Put this arm down there. All right? Hold that elbow up.

634
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:04,764
好的      好 就这样
 Okay.　　　　 All right. Hold it there.

635
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,837
嗨
Hi.

636
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:10,101
谢谢      谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

637
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:17,173
<i>我对你有点儿心动</i>
#I'm in like with you #

638
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:19,182
"爱你的 乔治"      啊
 "Love, George."　　　　 Ah.

639
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:22,776
<i>但还没爱上你</i>
#Not in love with you quite yet #

640
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,617
乔治   <i>我的理智</i>

嘿 简
Hey.Jane.

00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:16,289
对不起 我该先给你打电话 你钱包忘带了
I'm so sorry. I should've called, but you forgot your wallet.

好的
Okay.

687
00:40:56,234 --> 00:41:00,862
泰斯 我的父母是青梅竹马
So, Tess. My parents met playing hopscotch when they were,

688
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:02,104
他们8岁就认识了...
like, eight years old...

689

现在他们已经结婚42年了
and they were married for 42 years.

690
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,238
我这辈子都在等一个女人
And I've been waiting my whole life

691
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:09,346
希望能像我父母那样
to feel the way my dad felt about my mom.

692
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:12,780
也许我一直忙于事业...
And maybe I've been too busy trying to make something of myself...

693
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:15,250
我觉得我...      哦!
 but, I think I...　　　　 Oh!

694
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,412
错过了一些机会
missed some of those moments.

695
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,513
但是 泰斯 我第一眼见你...      好的
 But, Tess, the second that I saw you...　　　　 Okay.

696
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,821
就知道我们在一起会很快乐
I knew that we could be great together.

697
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,521
所以 呃...
So, um

698
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,656
泰斯 你愿意嫁给我么?
Tess, will you marry me?

699
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:32,202
是的 我当然愿意
Yes, of course I will.

00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,344
等一下 就是说 你要搬回来住?
So, wait. Does this mean that you're moving back here?

702
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,213
是的
Yup.

703
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,425
哇啊 我... 我不知道说什么好
Whoa. Well, I I don't know what to say.

704
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,690
你先是给了简一份工作...
You give Jane a job...

705
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,052
现在又让泰斯回家了
then you get Tessie to move back home.

706
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:56,922
乔治 你是我的英雄 真的
George, you're my hero. I mean it.

707
00:41:57,028 --> 00:42:00,361
哦 谢谢 你有一对特别出色的女儿
Oh, thank you. You have a couple of pretty great girls here.

708
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,631
等一下 我拿样东西 哪也别去
Wait.Just a second. I wanna get somethin'. Don't go anywhere.

709
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,568
谁不是呢?
Who isn't?

710
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,801
我真高兴咱两今天来见我爸爸
I'm so excited that we did this today.

711
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,037
他那么高兴      泰斯
 He's so happy.　　　　 Tess.

712
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:18,479
爸爸!
Daddy!

713
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:22,178
你妈妈会想让你穿这个的      爸爸 谢谢!
Your mother would've wanted you to have it.　　　　 Daddy, thank you!

714
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:24,220
好的
Okay.

715
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:27,814
谢谢      好的
 Thank you.　　　　 Okay.

716
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:31,088
简 你不会介意的 对吧      不 不介意
Jane, you don't mind, right?　　　　 No. No.

717
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,222
以后你也能穿
 You can have it after me.

718
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:35,256
不用了 这样很好 妈妈会想给你的
No. That's good. It's right. Mom would've wanted that.

719
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,800
是的 妈妈是想这样的      我的乖女儿简
 Yeah. Mom would've wanted that.　　　　 That's my Jane.

720
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,961
好吧 那就这样吧 
Okay. Yeah. That's right.

721
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:43,734
这是我妈妈的婚纱
It was my mother's.

722
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:46,742
是不是棒极了?      是很美
 Isn't that amazing?　　　　 That's beautiful.

723
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:50,507
爸爸 我真不知道该说些什么
Dad, I don't even know what to say.

724
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:55,210
我一直在想你为什么想见我
Uh, so I'm just trying to figure out why you decided to meet with me.

725
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:57,287
你一直躲着我 突然之间...
You've been ducking me and then, all of a sudden

726
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,913
我妹妹要结婚了
My little sister's getting married.

727
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:02,117
先你一步      我烦的不是这个
 Ah, before you.　　　　 That's not what I'm upset about.

728
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:04,057
那是为什么?
Then what are you upset about?

729
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:07,824
你不了解泰斯 她会把一切交给我来做的
You don't know Tess. She's gonna want me to do everything.

730
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,866
我不仅要当她的伴娘
I'm not gonna just be her maid of honor.

731
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,697
我还要打理一切
I'm gonna be taking care of everything.

732
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:15,101
那你干嘛不拒绝?      什么?
 So why don't you just say, "No"?　　　　 What?

733
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:17,572
说不
Say, "No."

734
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:21,634
你以前拒绝过别人么?      当然了
 You have said, "No," to people before?　　　　 Yes. Of course.

735
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:25,773
很多次 各种场合... 其实一次也没有过
Many, many times. In this situation, never. Not once.

736
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,511
但是你想拒绝的
Ah, but you want to say, "No."

737
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,780
那是我妹妹 我不能拒绝
But I can't. It's my sister.

738
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,550
就因为是你妹妹你就不能拒绝...
But you can say, "No." Because it's your sister

739
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:36,456
好吧 知道我们接下来要干吗? 来做个练习
All right. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna practice.

740
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,994
好么? 我们来练习说不 你以为我在开玩笑?
All right? We're gonna practice saying, "No." You think I'm kidding?

741
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,428
转过来 我们来玩个游戏 我很幽默的
Turn around. We're gonna play this game. Come on. Humor me.

742
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:44,057
好吧 简 借我50元
All right.Jane, give me 50 bucks.

743
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,569
不!      简 50元而已 我会还的
 No!　　　　Jane, it's 50 bucks. I'll pay you back.

744
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:51,267
不
No.

745
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,243
简 我需要你...
Jane, I need you...

746
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,337
借给我50元
to give me 50 bucks.

747
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:02,115
不?
No?

748
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,380
嗯 不赖
Eh, not bad.

749
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:06,718
我能喝你的酒么?      当然可以
 Can I have your drink?　　　　 Sure.

750
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:08,724
不!
No!

751
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:12,387
哦 不      刚才做得很好的
 Oh, no.　　　　 You were doing so well.

752
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,760
这次太糟了      嗯
 That's terrible.　　　　 Mmhmm.

753
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:18,163
你去定过花了?      去了
 So you went by the flower shop and ordered the favors?　　　　 Yup.

754
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,169
啊哈 请帖呢?
What about the invitation mockups?

755
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:22,262
发了      这太有趣了!
 Done.　　　　 This is so much fun!

756
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,741
我有没有告诉你我还请了朱莉当伴娘?
Did I tell you I asked Julie to be one of the bridesmaids?

757
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,745
谁?      堂妹朱莉 
 Who?　　　　 Cousin Julie. Second cousin twice removed.

758
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,743
那咪咪咋办? 堂妹咪咪?      哦 绝不请她
What about Mimi? Cousin Mimi?　　　　 Oh, no way.

759
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:37,446
她挺着个大肚子 会破坏美感的
She's so pregnant. It'll just throw off the aesthetics.

760
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:39,921
对不起 我知道你不喜欢朱莉
I'm sorry. I know you don't love Julie.

761
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:42,515
谁会喜欢那个小时候她一直叫我...
What's not to love about a woman who asked me if I chaired...

762
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,459
平胸委员会主席的女人?
the Itty Bitty Titty Committee all through my teen years?

763
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:50,000
别听她的 你胸部也挺大的 虽然晚熟了点
Just don't listen to her. Your boobs came in eventually. They just missed high school.

764
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,569
第三个伴娘我想让你邀请你的朋友...
As for the third bridesmaid, I want you to ask your friend...

765
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,661
那个特粗鲁的      你是说卡西?
 that really rude one.　　　　 Casey?

766
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:55,519
对 对      我家卡西?
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah.　　　　 My Casey?

767
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,425
她很漂亮 适合穿无带的伴娘裙
She's really pretty. She can pull off the strapless.

768
00:44:58,425 --> 00:45:01,768
我没什么女性朋友  她们都莫名的不喜欢我
I don't have that many girlfriends. For some reason, girls just don't like me.

769
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:03,237
真不知道为什么
I don't know why.

770
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:07,978
好吧 我知道为什么 能帮我问问她么?
Okay. Fine. I know why. Will you just ask her?

771
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:12,990
当然 当然可以
Sure. Of course.

772
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,253
我在想为婚宴做个幻灯片
So I was also thinking we could do a slide show for the rehearsal dinner.

773
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,693
放一些乔治和我的合照 说点我俩的趣事
You know, put pictures of George and I together and say funny things.

774
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,550
好的      你猜怎么着
 Okay.　　　　 Oh, and guess what.

775
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,062
那个你特迷恋的作家...
That writer you obsess about...

776
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:26,000
想在日报上给我们做个专栏
he wants to do a whole Commitments column on us in the Journal.

777
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,037
他给我打的电话 你敢相信么?
He called me. Can you believe it?

778
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,130
这一点 我绝对相信
At this point, I absolutely can.

779
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:33,540
听着 你的话我考虑了很久 我认为你是对的
Listen, um, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and I think you're right.

780
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:37,478
我觉得如果能像父母那样举办婚礼会很特别
I think it would be so special if I did a wedding just like Mom and Dad's.

781
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:41,381
你是说?      尤其是穿着妈妈的婚纱
Just like?　　　　 You know, especially since I'm wearing Mom's dress.

782
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:44,249
所以...你看!
So, tada!

783
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:47,791
船屋?      是啊
 The Boathouse?　　　　 Uhhuh.

784
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:48,550
刚开始我打电话过去
At first, when I called,

785
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,293
他们说18个月内都定满了
they said they had no availability for 18 months.

786
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:52,597
我第9次打电话的时候
But then the ninth time I called,

787
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,296
他们说有一家取消了预约
they said they had a cancellation.

788
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:57,094
因为新娘跟新郎的父兄们...
Apparently the bride slept with the groom's father and brother...

789
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,294
姐姐...差不多一家人都上过床
and sister and all these people.

790
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,531
所以 很明显 婚礼告吹 他们都很不快
So, obviously, it got canceled and they were all devastated.

791
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,608
但这也意味着...
But which means...

792
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,869
三周后我就能结婚了
we're getting married in three weeks.

793
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,968
三周?
Three weeks?

794
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,742
是啊 哦 简 我知道你能很快搞定
Uhhuh. Oh,Jane. I know you can pull it together quickly.

795
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:14,545
我也不想等那么久...
And I didn't wanna wait that long anyway, so

796
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:21,725
你能不能为我高兴点
Uh, you could be a little excited for me.

797
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:25,113
我很高兴... 但是
No, I am. I am. It's just

798
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:29,165
你也想穿着妈妈的婚纱在船屋结婚
It's just that you wanted to get married at The Boathouse in Mom's dress too.

799
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:32,633
我知道
I know.

800
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,864
我只是... 没想到你会想这么做...
No, I just I didn't know that that's what you wanted...

801
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:38,737
但如果你想这样 我希望你快乐
but if it is, then I just want you to be happy.

802
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:40,970
你知道的      太棒了!
 You know that.　　　　 Great!

803
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:43,478
好 我们现在来谈谈重要的事?
Okay. Now can we talk about more important stuff?

804
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,050
我真不喜欢这些台布
Come on. I really don't like the linens,

805
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,449
我们得租些新台布...
and I think we need to rent new ones...

806
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,452
因为它们跟我选的颜色主题不搭配
because they do not go with the color scheme that I picked out.

807
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:52,988
那个自私的婊子
That selfish whore.

808
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:56,117
别误会      别误会
 Namaste.　　　　 Namaste.

809
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:58,127
我不敢相信 难以置信
I can't believe it. I cannot believe it.

810
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,255
没有男人不喜欢她 即使是好人乔治
There is no man that won't fall for her. Even a dogooder like George.

811
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:06,029
男人见到她就像中邪了一样丧失理智
Men just become hypnotized by her voodoo and they lose their minds.

812
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,534
你不能操办你爱的人和你妹妹的婚礼
You can't plan your sister's wedding to the man you love.

813
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,629
太难受了
It's sick.

814
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,867
不怪她 她不知道我对他的感觉
To be fair, she didn't know how I felt about him.

815
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,604
她也不应该知道...他是我上司  
And nor should she He's my boss.

816
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:18,079
我必须忘掉他 别无选择
I'm just gonna have to get over it. I don't really have a choice.

817
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:20,150
你也没得选择
And neither do you.

818
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,775
她想让你当伴娘
She wants you to be a bridesmaid.

819
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:24,286
你别害我了
You are shitting me.

820
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:25,946
认真点
 Hello?　　　　 Please.

821
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:28,991
不 不 我有原则 我绝不会去的
No. No, I won't do it, on principle.

822
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,995
我要坚持原则 不去 别把我算上
I say, "No," on principle. No. You can count me out.

823
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:36,191
拜托 别让我孤军奋战呀
Please. Please don't leave me alone in this.

824
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,393
求求你了      好吧 好吧
 Please, please, please.　　　　 Fine. Fine.

825
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:41,801
我是为你去的 如果她惹毛我 我让她好看
Because it's you. But if she crosses me, I'm gonna kick her ass.

826
00:47:41,906 --> 00:47:45,137
也让你好看 要是我喝上点酒...
And then I will kick your ass. Then I'm gonna have a couple drinks

827
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:52,176
又没有标志说 "严禁说话"
There's no sign that says, "No talking."

828
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,053
三周? 不可能完成的
Three weeks? It cannot be done.

829
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:03,593
对我来说时间不够!      好吧 嗯...
 It is not enough time for one of my creations!　　　　 Okay, um...

830
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:07,687
安东尼 记得我把你介绍给谢克特夫妇么...
Antoine, remember when I brought you the Schecters...

831
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,995
他们定做的是六层心形杰作?
and they commissioned that sixtiered, heartshaped masterpiece?

832
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,763
后来还做了个能吃的礼物塔...
Then, of course, the tower of edible gifts...

833
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,862
放在史夫曼・卡丹诺夫妇的室外婚宴上
for the SchifmanGuardino outdoor fiesta.

834
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,550
你无所不能 咱俩心知肚明
You can do anything, and we both know it.

835
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,925
你会做这个蛋糕的 并且在三周内完成...
You're gonna do the cake, and you're gonna do it in three weeks...

836
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:24,580
而且还要打折      三周?
 and I would like a discount, please.　　　　 Three weeks?

837
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,276
真让我高兴      太棒了
 It pleases me.　　　　 Delightful.

838
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:30,376
我们的蛋糕定上了
We have a cake.

839
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,425
你来这里做什么?
 What are you doing here?

840
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:34,925
嗨 我是马尔科姆・道尔
Hi. I'm Malcolm Doyle.

841
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,893
什么?      我现在才相信这是真的
 What?　　　　 Oh, yes. I didn't wanna believe it till you were here.

842
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:43,378
嗯 这是我未婚夫乔治      嗨 恭喜二位
Um, this is my fiance, George.　　　　 Hi. Congratulations to the both of you.

843
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,987
谢谢
Thank you.

844
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:46,961
宝贝 我得接个电话 好么?
Oh. Babe, I gotta take this. All right?

845
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:49,096
好的      如果蛋糕方面有紧急情况...
 Okay.　　　　 If there's a cake emergency...

846
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,367
我马上就回来
I'm right over here.

847
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:53,136
哦 这是简 我姐姐
Oh, and this is Jane, my sister.

848
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,804
她迷恋你的文章
She's obsessed with your stories.

849
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,643
她还偷偷把你的文章保存起来   好的
 She keeps them, but pretends she doesn't, but she does.　　　　 Okay.

850
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,047
她是你的头号粉丝
She's your number one fan.

851
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,051
不是古怪的那种
Not in a creepy way though.

852
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:07,214
好的      你说你的名字是 "凯文"
 Right.　　　　 You said your name was "Kevin."

853
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:09,815
凯文的凯 凯文的文
As in "Kevin."

854
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:12,987
我用马尔科姆做笔名来躲开疯狂新娘的追击
Well, I use "Malcolm" for the byline so I don't get stalked by crazy brides.

855
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:15,861
你是怎么认识乔治的?      你是个混蛋
 So how did you meet George?　　　　 You're an asshole.

856
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:18,400
简      怎么? 抱歉 他跟我说他叫 "凯文"
Jane.　　　　 What? I'm sorry. He said his name was "Kevin."

857
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:21,630
我只是...我只是有点晕了      等等
 I'm just I'm a little bit confused.　　　　 Wait.

858
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,050
你们认识?
 You guys know each other?

859
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,301
我们都在这个圈子里工作 所以...
Well, we both work the wedding circuit, so

860
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,346
能让我们单独谈下么? 我要...一小会儿...
Can you just give us one second? I'm just gonna over for one second...

861
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,415
跟他谈谈你
talk to talk about you.

862
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,349
安东尼
Antoine.

863
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,352
你骗我
You lied to me.

864
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:38,999
没有 我说过我是作家
No. I told you I was a writer.

865
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:40,252
只是没告诉你我写什么
I didn't tell you what I wrote.

866
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:45,021
但 但是 你写的东西太美了
But But you write the most beautiful things.

867
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:47,962
你是不是相信真爱和婚姻却假装愤世嫉俗
Do you actually believe in love and marriage and pretend to be a cynic...

868
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:49,999
还是你愤世嫉俗
or are you a cynic

869
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:52,365
像我这样相信浪漫的女孩?
who knows how to spin romantic crap for girls like me?

870
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:56,371
我不明白 但我想是后者吧
I didn't follow that at all. But I think the second one, the spinning crap one.

871
00:49:56,473 --> 00:50:00,050
天呀 我感觉像是发现自己最爱的歌
Oh, my God. I feel like I found out my favorite love song

872
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,638
其实是关于三明治的
was written about a sandwich.

873
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:05,203
我能跟你讲讲乔治跟我的故事么?
Um, can I steal you away to tell you about George and me?

874
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:07,307
当然 当然 就是为这个才来的
Of course. Of course. That's why I'm here.

875
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:35,944
什么? 泰斯不在这
What? Tess is not here.

876
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:39,709
我是来见你的      为什么?
 I'm here to see you.　　　　 Why?

877
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:43,253
开门吧 我得从亲戚朋友口中了解情况
Come on. I have to talk to all of the friends and family.

878
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,687
就五分钟好么?
It'll take five minutes. Please?

879
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,248
看在乔治和泰斯的份上?
For George and Tess?

880
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,261
好吧
Well, okay.

881
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:56,231
谢谢
Thank you.

882
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,824
我能进来么?      想问什么就问吧
 May I come in?　　　　Just ask me what you wanna ask me.

883
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:02,235
或者你还想再撒点谎?      我可没撒谎
 Or would you prefer to lie some more?　　　　 I didn't lie to you.

884
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,253
我不知道你为什么一直这么说
I don't know why you keep saying that.

885
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:04,363
我也许是忽略了点细节
 I may have left out a couple of things.

886
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:07,137
别再计较这个了 行吗?
Can we just get this over with?

887
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:11,044
伴娘是一个奇怪的年轻女子
The maid of honor is a peculiar young woman.

888
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:15,209
说说你对泰斯旋风般的浪漫故事作何感想
So tell me how you feel about Tess's whirlwind romance.

889
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:17,287
再高兴不过了 她是我妹妹
I couldn't be happier. She's my kid sister.

890
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,583
我教会她看表 骑车...
I taught her how to tell time, how to ride a bike...

891
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,590
用洗碗机
how to steam flounder in the dishwasher.

892
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:25,287
可以说是我养大了她...哦 请别用那句话
I mean, I practically raised her Oh, please, don't print that.

893
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:28,627
我爸爸会难过的
That would kill my father.

894
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:31,200
等等 那些是什么?
Wait. What are those?

895
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:34,862
没什么
Nothing.

896
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:36,872
该不会是...     不!
 Are those　　　　 No!

897
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,539
是伴娘礼服?      不关你事
 Are they bridesmaid dresses?　　　　 This is none of your business.

898
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,014
哦! 老天呀
Oh! Good God.

899
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:49,950
怎么? 你还收集了一橱柜 为什么?
What? You kept them all? You have a whole closet full. Why?

900
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:52,715
我朋友很多 我也喜欢收集它们
I have a lot of friends and I like to keep them.

901
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,613
对 完全说得通...
Right. Well, that makes complete sense...

902
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:58,086
因为它们很"漂亮"      有几件并不难看
 because they're beautiful.　　　　 Some are not that bad.

903
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,595
"不难看"? 我真想见识一下哪件不难看
"Not that bad"? I'd like to see one of them that's not that bad.

904
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:02,631
好吧
Fine.

905
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:05,531
呃...不是那件
Um, well Not that one.

906
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:09,436
这件...这件真的很...
This one This one is really

907
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,508
糟糕 对吧?你想用的是这个词吧
Horrible. Right? Was the word you're looking for.

908
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:13,667
这是什么颜色? 呕吐物的颜色?
What color is this? Vomit?

909
00:52:13,777 --> 00:52:15,904
不 这是... 这叫橄榄绿 很流行的
No, it's like a It's an "olivey" green. It's very in.

910
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:17,913
告诉你 穿身上可好看了
I'm telling you, it looks great on.

911
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:21,212
不 我告诉你 这叫精神摧残...
Uh, no. I'm telling you that this is an instrument of torture...

912
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:23,582
新娘让你穿是为了衬托她的美
inflicted on you by a bride who wants you to look ugly.

913
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:26,622
不 吉娜选它是因为大家穿都好看 
No.Jenna picked it because it looks good on everybody.

914
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:29,988
受访者有轻微妄想症 并轻信别人的说辞
Slightly delusional and will believe anything anyone tells her.

915
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:33,358
那不是真的 我要证明给你看你错了
That is not true and I'm going to show you you are wrong.

916
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:48,377
看见了吧?
See?

917
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:52,939
没那么难看 腰带很漂亮的...
It's not so bad. This sash is really very flat

918
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,644
好吧 你是对的 没那么难看 
Okay. You are totally right about the dress. It is not that bad.

919
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:57,720
但是 你瞧瞧这颜色
But, come on. The color? Please.

920
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:02,315
那是你闪光灯的问题 曝光出来怪怪的...
Well, it's your flash. I think it's blowing it out weird...

921
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,553
如果好好照...好吧 不是多好看
and if it were just a normal Okay, it's not very good.

922
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,289
你看起来像亮闪闪的美人鱼
You kind of look like a shiny mermaid.

923
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,675
我是在夸你 她才不想站在一个高挑美丽...
You should be flattered. She didn't want to stand next to a tall, beautiful woman...

924
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:15,100
还穿着华丽的女孩身边
and have you actually looking decent.

925
00:53:15,205 --> 00:53:19,574
这还不是最糟的一件
It's really not the worst one.

926
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:21,837
如果我必须选一件...我会选这一件
If I had to pick one I got a good one.

927
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,680
这是我最喜欢的      哦 我的上帝
 This is my favorite.　　　　 Oh, my God.

928
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:30,753
那是什么鬼玩意儿?      主题婚礼
 What the hell is that?　　　　 Theme wedding.

929
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:34,756
什么主题  "侮辱"? 天呀!
What was the theme, "humiliation"? God!

930
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,628
不 没人会用《飘》作主题
 No, people do not have Gone With The Wind weddings.

931
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:37,918
我参加过三个
I have been to three.

932
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:40,724
照吧      好
 Let's do it.　　　　 All right.

933
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:42,822
说"茄子"      茄子
 Y'all say, "Diddlydee."　　　　 Diddlydee.

934
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:44,764
哦!
Oh!

935
00:53:46,803 --> 00:53:49,271
我晕了 你还有什么礼服 多给我看点
I feel sick. All right. What else you got? Show me some more.

936
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:53,704
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

937
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,278
你得让我看看和服   拿来
 You have to show me Benihana.　　　　 Give it.

938
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:01,274
# You ain't got the crime 'Cause she ain't got #

939
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:04,286
#Nothing' on you #

940
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,652
啊!
Aha!

941
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,751
很漂亮 你觉得自己漂亮么?
Very pretty. Do you feel pretty?

942
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:15,025
人见人爱
Adorable.

943
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,934
每个新娘都喜欢饰品
Every bride loves her accessories.

944
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:22,233
男人穿裙子 女人穿西装
Men wore dresses. Women wore suits.

945
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:31,143
哇!
Whoa!

946
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:37,209
凯文?      哎
 Kevin?　　　　 Yup.

947
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,448
哦!
Oh!

948
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:41,456
啊...
Um

949
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:43,719
这是什么主题?
What was the theme here?

950
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,057
洛杉矶婚礼
L.A. Wedding.

951
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:49,257
<i>如果你感受到这火辣的气氛 就快来狂欢</i>
# You gotta party If you're feeling hearty #

952
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,597
<i>她爱得难以自拔</i>
#She's in love now #

953
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:03,175
<i>还是你想看到</i>
# Would you rather see #

954
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,478
<i>你知道的 耶</i>
# That you know Yeah #

955
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:10,246
<i>来吧</i>
#Come on #

956
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:25,526
总共27件礼服 太开玩笑了
Twentyseven dresses. You gotta be kidding me.

957
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:28,833
我不明白 你...你参加完婚礼
I don't get it. All right. You You do the thing, you have the dress.

958
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:31,339
就把礼服扔了呗 看那一大橱柜
Just throw it out. That's a huge closet.

959
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,534
住在纽约 不能那样浪费空间
You live in New York. You cannot be eating up space like that.

960
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:36,841
也许有点可笑 但它们给我带来了美好时光
Strange as it sounds, I've had some really good times in those dresses.

961
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,972
可能有点怪吧      我不相信你的话
 Weird as that may be.　　　　 I don't believe you.

962
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:41,482
他们让我穿的奇怪点我也不介意
I don't care if somebody wants me to wear a funny dress.

963
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:43,175
那是他们的大日子 不是我的
 It's their day, not mine.

964
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:44,281
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

965
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:46,948
如果支持他们的婚礼意味着...
And if supporting them when they get married means...

966
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:49,355
要去爬阿尔卑斯山...
snowshoeing to a mountaintop in the Alps or...

967
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:52,050
或把泉水汇成湖再放几只天鹅进去...
 helping to caulk a fountain for some swans, then

968
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,156
你真这么干过?
You actually did that?

969
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:57,131
哦 我为了他们两肋插刀
Oh, I'm a really, very good caulker.

970
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,696
她像菜刀
Likes caulk.

971
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,865
好吧 但说真的
All right. But come on. Seriously.

972
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,569
我是说 你花了多少时间为别人做这些?
I mean, how much time do you spend doing this for other people?

973
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:09,703
你自己呢? 难道你就没有需要?
What aboutWhat about you? You don't have any needs?

974
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,213
不 我没需要 我是神
No, I don't. I'm Jesus.

975
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:18,478
总有一天...谁知道...但总有一天...
Someday God knows when But someday...

976
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,488
将会是我自己的大日子
it'll be my day.

977
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,286
这些人都会来参加我的婚礼 所以...
And then all those people will be there for me. So

978
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:25,554
也就是说如果我能...
That is if I ever

979
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:27,960
对不起
Sorry.

980
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:36,071
你不明白的
You don't get it.

981
00:56:36,173 --> 00:56:38,107
没关系的 你怎么可能明白?
That's fine. Why would you?

982
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,502
嘿 我需要你的购物清单
Hey. I need your registry list.

983
00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:12,040
我以为你会在楼下等呢
I thought you were gonna wait downstairs.

984
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:17,703
那是什么?
What is that?

985
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:19,300
乔治在泰卢拉德(科罗拉多州)谁在这儿?
 George is in Telluride. Who's in here?

986
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,282
没人
No one.

987
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,645
我们来大厅谈      泰斯
 Let's talk in the hall.　　　　 Tess.

988
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:24,243
简...
Jane

989
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,413
他想找份兼职做
He was looking for a parttime job.

990
00:57:26,523 --> 00:57:29,424
他...在打扫公寓
He's... cleaning the apartment.

991
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:31,460
哦 小子     瞧 别让乔治知道
 # Oh, boy #　　　　 Look, don't tell George.

992
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:33,461
这是佩德罗和我的小秘密 好么?
It's Pedro and my little secret, okay?

993
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:36,726
我不知道自己究竟在做什么
#I don't really know what I'm doing ##

994
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,494
凯文!
Kevin!

995
00:57:38,602 --> 00:57:41,230
那篇关于伴娘的稿子...进展怎么样?
That bridesmaid story what do you have so far?

996
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:44,102
遇到点瓶颈 我正想办法呢
Uh, it's a little rough. I'm still workin' on it.

997
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,175
我要看      我还没...
 I want to see it.　　　　 I'm not even

998
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:51,578
现在就看 发我邮箱里      我还没完成呢
 Right now. Email it.　　　　 It's notI'm not finished with it. It's not done.

999
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:01,597
你能走开么? 我没请你
Can you go away, please? I did not invite you.

1000
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:02,613
泰斯请我来的
Well, luckily Tess did.

1001
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:06,420
我报道婚礼时得目击所有的环节
When I cover a wedding, I gotta see every aspect.

1002
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,158
你知道 你妹妹想要那么得到处买的东西...
You know, your sister wants so many presents from so many stores...

1003
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,496
却连登个记也不自己来
that she physically cannot register for them all herself.

1004
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:14,502
她时间紧迫 定婚期太短
She's pressed for time. It's a short engagement.

1005
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:16,663
天呢 另一个?
Good God. Another one?

1006
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:18,673
对你来说 这只是个焙盘
To you, it's just another casserole dish.

1007
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:21,369
这将是泰斯用来做妈最爱的圣诞烤肉的盘子
To Tess, it's the pot she's gonna cook my mother's Christmas roast in.

1008
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:23,946
哦 泰斯会做饭?
Oh, Tess cooks?

1009
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,413
好吧 是我做 但泰斯会在场...
All right. Well, I'm gonna cook it. But Tess will be there...

1010
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:28,416
乔治跟她在一起
with George.

1011
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:29,660
而这个不是一般的 "装花的瓶"
 And this isn't just another "vahze."

1012
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,543
那叫花瓶
Vase.

1013
00:58:30,654 --> 00:58:33,248
泰斯会把它拿出来...
This is the "vahze" that Tess will get out...

1014
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:37,087
因为乔治在回家的路上想买些花
when George brings home flowers, just because he felt like it.

1015
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:39,389
明白了 那这个...
I see. And this

1016
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:44,297
是公鸡形状的伞架 让乔治放伞用的
this is the roostershaped umbrella holder that will hold all of George's umbrellas.

1017
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,892
好吧 你就使坏吧
Fine. Be a jerk.

1018
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,972
我是说这些不仅仅是用具
All I'm saying is that this isn't just stuff.

1019
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:52,303
这些是他们共同生活的见证      不
 These are the things that make up a life together.　　　　 No.

1020
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:56,140
这都是些废品 每年盈利70亿的婚礼行业...
This is the useless crap that the 70billiondollarayear wedding industry...

1021
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:59,010
设法让人们认为不这么做就不会得到幸福
has convinced us all that we have to have or we won't be happy.

1022
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:00,347
知道我怎么想?
You know what I think?

1023
00:59:00,347 --> 00:59:02,414
我认为你那些统计数字和理论...
I think that all your statistics and theories...

1024
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:04,544
只不过是障眼法
are just a smoke screen.

1025
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:05,737
哦 真的? 为了什么?
 Oh, really? For what?

1026
00:59:05,737 --> 00:59:08,055
你的小秘密...不管是什么
Your little secretwhatever it is.

1027
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,894
也许是你父母离婚了
Your parents got divorced.

1028
00:59:09,894 --> 00:59:11,059
你还没找到合适的女孩
You haven't found the right girl.

1029
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:13,425
而且害怕永远也找不到      不错
 You're afraid you never will.　　　　 Mmhmm.

1030
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,816
而我认为你如此喜欢婚礼...
And I think you love weddings so much...

1031
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:18,816
因为比起自己你更希望关注别人的精彩时刻
because you'd rather focus on other people's Kodak moments than make memories of your own.

1032
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:19,613
不错 知道为什么吗?
You're right. Know why?

1033
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:22,870
因为婚礼能人忘记自己单身的事实
Because weddings are the perfect place to forget about being single.

1034
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:25,498
我觉得你只想要婚礼... 婚礼 而不是婚姻
I think you want a wedding not a marriage, a wedding.

1035
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:28,203
你有毛病吧?
What is your problem?

1036
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,439
是不是你老婆在婚礼上离你而去了?
Did you have your own fancy wedding and your wife left you or something?

1037
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:34,914
中奖
Bingo.

1038
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,918
什么?
What?

1039
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,920
顺便告诉你 她跟我大学室友跑了
With my roommate from college, by the way.

1040
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,081
所以我认为你还能加点分
So I think you get an extra bingo for that.

1041
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:46,185
哦 糟糕 凯文...
Oh, shit. Kevin, I'm

1042
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:48,764
对不起 我...我只是胡乱猜测
I'm so sorry. It was just It was a guess.

1043
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,425
猜得好
It was a good one.

1044
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:53,700
作为一对自己一无所知的人...
For someone who has no insight whatsoever into herself...

1045
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:55,703
你把我看透了
you nailed me right on the head.

1046
00:59:57,474 --> 01:00:00,272
想不想把店里最难看的东西买给泰斯?
Want to find the ugliest stuff in the store and register Tess for it?

1047
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,480
开始吧
Let's do it.

1048
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,592
哇哦
Wow.

1049
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:20,322
我说了还没写完呢      不 写得很好
 I told you I was not done with it yet.　　　　 No, it's good.

1050
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,625
我刚才的意思是"哇 写得不赖"
I meant, "Wow, it's actually decent."

1051
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:25,428
我不得不承认 我惊呆了...
I have to admit, I was shocked...

1052
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:29,301
啊 既巧妙又辛辣...
but, uh, it's smart and, uh, biting...

1053
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,306
事实上 同时很有娱乐性
and actually entertaining as hell.

1054
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:34,400
谢谢      你真的看透了这个女孩
 Well, thank you.　　　　 You really nailed this girl.

1055
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:38,345
我们把它放在周日的头版
We're running it Sunday, front page of the section.

1056
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:41,781
啊 你可是为了这个才忙得上蹿下跳
Um, here is where you jump up and down with gratitude.

1057
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:44,945
哦... 不 不 不 我只是...
Oh No, no, no, no. I just

1058
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:47,853
认为稿子还不完美 我想精益求精
I just don't think it's perfect yet. I really want to get this right.

1059
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:48,987
我们应该再等一周
 We should just hold it a week.

1060
01:00:48,987 --> 01:00:50,791
等等 你求了几个月...
Wait. You've been begging me for months...

1061
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:54,091
现在却要我给你一周来修改几个标点?
and now you want me to hold the story so you can move some commas around?

1062
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:57,257
不知道 相处后发现她不仅是个永远的伴娘
I don't know. Now that I'm in it, she's more than just this perpetual bridesmaid.

1063
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,495
她身上还有些别的东西
You know, I don't know. There's There's a lot more to her than that.

1064
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:02,901
要不是因为我了解你...
Huh. If I didn't know you any better...

1065
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:05,668
我还以为你对她有点动心了
I would say that you'd developed a little crush.

1066
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:08,539
真好笑 瞧 我会改得更好
Very funny. Look, I know I can make it better.

1067
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:12,103
现在就很好      能再给我一周吗? 就一周
It's good the way it is.　　　　 Will you just give me a week? Just a week.

1068
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:15,116
好吧 出去
Fine. Get out.

1069
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:23,724
嗨      嗨 谢谢你这么快赶来
 Hi.　　　　 Oh, hey. Thank you for coming on such short notice.

1070
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:26,144
不客气 很高兴能帮上忙
Oh, it's no problem. I'm happy to help.

1071
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:29,597
在菜肴方面我比泰斯有经验 你可以放心
And I have more experience eating than Tess does, so you're in good hands.

1072
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:33,191
按照您的指示 我们把婚宴用餐准备好了
Now, we've planned your wedding dinner to your exact specifications.

1073
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:44,309
简的电话      是泰斯吗？
Jane's phone.　　　　 Tess?

1074
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:47,542
嗨 我是凯文      嗨！文章写得怎么样了
 Hey, it's Kevin.　　　　 Hey! How is the article coming?

1075
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,051
会是一篇巨作 你会高兴的
Uh, I think it's gonna be a great piece. I think you'll be very happy.

1076
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:54,590
我快等不及了      嘿 知道简在哪吗？
I can't wait.　　　　 Hey, listen. Any chance you know where Jane is?

1077
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:58,457
我最喜欢泰斯的地方是她从来不胡扯
Yeah, you know, the thing that I like about Tess is there's no bullshit.

1078
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:01,257
她敢于展现真正的自我
You know, she's not afraid to be herself.

1079
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,828
乔治 关于泰斯我有些话要说
George, about Tess There's something that I want to say.

1080
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,738
什么?
What?

1081
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:16,910
我只是为你感到高兴 找到了你一直追寻的
I'm just so happy for you, that you found what you were looking for.

1082
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:20,073
好的 那么你最喜欢...
All right. So what's your favorite part...

1083
01:02:20,183 --> 01:02:21,514
婚礼的哪个部分?
of a wedding?

1084
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:23,643
太容易了
Oh, that's easy.

1085
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:25,988
当音乐响起 新娘走了进来...
You know when the music starts and the bride makes her big entrance...

1086
01:02:25,988 --> 01:02:27,890
所有的人转身注视着她
and everybody turns to look at her?

1087
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:30,755
那一刻我会看着新郎 他的表情说明了一切
That's when I look at the groom. 'Cause his face says it all.

1088
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:34,091
那就是真爱

那么在你的婚礼上 当你进入会场时...
Okay. So when you get married and you make your entrance...

1091
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:41,269
我可以看着新郎吗?
I have full permission to look at the groom?

1092
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:46,604
对 看吧 请确认那个可怜的笨蛋还站在那里
Yes. Please do. Please make sure the poor sucker is still standing there.

1093
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:50,167
没开玩笑吧? 谁能娶到你是他的福气
Are you kidding me? Some guy would be lucky to have you.

1094
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,050
之前你对着辣茄狼吞虎咽的样子
And the way that you attacked that tomatillo

1095
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,148
谁能抵挡得住？

你来干什么?
What are you doing here?

1100
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:17,469
你们在挑选婚宴的菜肴？
Are you guys picking out the wedding meal?

1101
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:21,476
泰斯呢?      她在做头发
 Where's Tess?　　　　 She's... getting her hair done.

1102
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:24,672
我只是在帮忙      
 I'm just helping out.

1103
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:27,716
我们正准备去莱茵贝克的古董店选些亚麻布
We're heading up to Rhinebeck to pick out some linens from an antique store.

1104
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:30,615
我们得走了 我和泰斯还要和我父母吃晚餐
Yeah, we really should go, because Tess and I have dinner with my parents.

1105
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,178
我和你一起走怎样?      什么? 不行
 Well, why don't I just go with you?　　　　 What? No. No. That's okay.

1106
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:37,987
我会按时送你过去 我借了我爸的沃尔沃车
Um, I can get you back on time. I got my dad's Volvo, and that thing books.

1107
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:40,085
好吧 我真的不介意 这很好
All right, look. I really don't mind. It's totally fine.

1108
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,425
关于那篇文章我还有几个问题要问
I got a couple more questions to ask you anyway for the article.

1109
01:03:42,425 --> 01:03:44,691
我很乐意通过电话或邮件回答
Which I'd be happy to answer, by phone or email.

1110
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:47,206
如果你们不介意 这很有用
If you wouldn't mind, that would be a great help.

1111
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,815
我根本不介意 我坚持
I don't mind at all. I insist.

1112
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,285
你跟个电灯泡似的
It was like a lightbulb.

1113
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:58,870
在那碗玉米粥旁边跟他调情
The second I saw you mooning at him over polenta.

1114
01:03:58,982 --> 01:03:59,738
你当然会心烦
Of course you're upset.

1115
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:01,007
因为你正在帮你妹妹和你爱的人...
You're planning your sister's wedding...

1116
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:03,017
策划婚礼
to the man that you're in love with.

1117
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,417
你陷进了一个恐怖的三角恋
You're stuck in this creepy little love triangle...

1118
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:08,719
一直以来 你为了这个婚宴绞尽脑汁
and all the while, you're about one monogrammed party favor away from blowing your brains out.

1119
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:10,656
真是可笑
That is ridiculous.

1120
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,729
拜托 不能告诉他      因为你是好心的简
Oh, come on. Course you can't tell him because you're Nice Jane, you're Sweet Jane.

1121
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,855
得了吧 你根本不知道自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about, okay?

1122
01:04:15,965 --> 01:04:17,113
他们是我的老板和我妹妹
He's my boss. She's my sister.

1123
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:20,061
能策划他们的婚礼我都快喜极而泣了
I am thrilled to be planning their wedding tickled even.

1124
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,900
就像我参与过的每场婚礼一样
Like I have been for every wedding that I've been a part of.

1125
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:25,907
你根本无法理解 因为你是个...
But you can't understand that because you're

1126
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:28,739
吝啬 邪恶又愤世嫉俗的人
you're mean... and dark and cynical.

1127
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,245
朋友 那是你的问题  与我无关
And, well, that's your problem, pal, not mine.

1128
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:32,814
朋友? 朋友?      对
 "Pal"? "Pal"?　　　　 Yeah. Uhhuh.

1129
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,817
嗨 朋友 这不算坏 你刚才叫我朋友
"Hey, pal. Pal." This is bad. You're calling me "pal."

1130
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:37,819
噢 你能不能给我安静点?
Oh, will you just be quiet?

1131
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:42,557
我懂了 你抓狂了 我毁了你整个下午...
Look, I get it. You're mad. I just ruined the whole afternoon...

1132
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:44,820
不然你就能和那个永不会选择你的人去快活
of you pining over somebody that you'll never, ever have.

1133
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:47,328
住嘴! 你给我住嘴！ 
Stop it! Just stop.

1134
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:52,058
好吧 能不能开慢点 好让我看清路标?
Okay. Would you slow down just a little bit so I can read this sign?

1135
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,994
我看不清了
Okay. My Spidey vision's not working so good.

1136
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:59,336
你可以开慢点吗?      能不能别管我！
 Do you think you could slow down just a little bit?　　　　 Would you leave me alone!

1137
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:04,176
说真的 疯狂的女士 车子打滑了 开慢点
Seriously. Crazy Lady, we're gonna hydroplane. Slow down.

1138
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,009
拜托 车子没有打滑
Come on. We are not gonna hydroplane.

1139
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:08,140
哇哦!
Whoa!

1140
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,947
哇哦! 车子打滑了 车子打滑!
Whoa! We're hydroplaning. We're hydroplaning!

1141
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:17,253
我们要死了! 我们要死了！
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

1142
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,590
我们要死了! 我们要死了！
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

1143
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:27,298
别跟我说话
Don't say anything.

1144
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,052
有信号吗?      没有
 You got anything?　　　　 No.

1145
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:52,659
说了别跟我说话 没什么好说的
I said don't! Nothing.

1146
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:10,304
打扰 你的公用电话坏了
Excuse me. Uh, your pay phone's dead.

1147
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,075
好样的 你们像"犯罪现场调查"里的人
Nice work. You're like one of those guys on C.S.I.

1148
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:16,715
我们能用你的电话吗?
Uh, any chance we could use your phone?

1149
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:18,810
来一杯苏格兰 3刻度(度量标准) 不加冰
Could I get a scotch, three fingers, no ice, please?

1150
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:21,185
你在搞什么?      现在很晚了      
 What are you doing?　　　　 Well, it's late...

1151
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,941
我们找不到拖车
we're not getting a tow,

1152
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:25,284
又被困在纽约的东第雷弗伦斯
and we're in East Deliverance, New York.

1153
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:27,295
我要来点喝的
I'm gonna have a drink.

1154
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,499
别这样 现在没人能帮我们
Come on. There's nobody you can help right now.

1155
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:33,753
为什么不坐下来放松一下 喝点酒?
Why don't you just sit down, relax, have a drink?

1156
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:35,196
多漫长的一天
It's been a long day.

1157
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:37,102

1160
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:49,613
啊!      2006年2月12号
 Ah!　　　　 Okay. February 12, 2006.

1161
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,815
克勒的婚礼 你写的那篇专栏感动了我
The Keller wedding. You wrote a column that moved me to tears.

1162
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:57,518
那是我看过得最美丽的笔触
It was downright, flatout the most beautiful thing I have ever read.

1163
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,720
我不记得了      你怎么会忘记?
 Oh I don't remember it.　　　　 How can you not remember that?

1164
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,729

 I don't remember it.　　　　 How can you not?

1165
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:04,959
那天是父亲的忌日 他哥哥从阿富汗回到家
It was the anniversary of the father's death. The brother flew home from Afghanistan.

1166
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:06,362
那样的感情是无法造假的
 You cannot fake emotion like that.

1167
01:07:06,362 --> 01:07:07,502
当然可以      
Oh, yes, you can.

1168
01:07:07,603 --> 01:07:11,039
一个好的作家能      你没那么好
 A good writer can.　　　　 You're not that good.

1169
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:15,042
爽!
Nice!

1170
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:20,209
婚礼里总有一样东西是让你喜欢的
There's gotta be one thing about weddings that you like.

1171
01:07:22,385 --> 01:07:24,285
免费酒柜      不是
 Open bar.　　　　 No.

1172
01:07:25,988 --> 01:07:28,320
好吧
All right.

1173
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:32,588
当新娘走进来的时候 她迈着神圣的步子
So when the bride comes in and she makes her giant, grand entrance

1174
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:35,255
我喜欢回头看看那个可怜的新郎
I like to glance back at the poor bastard getting married.

1175
01:07:36,366 --> 01:07:38,357
虽然我觉得他很蠢...
'Cause even though I think he's an idiot...

1176
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:42,495
他居然欣然地成为合法婚姻的奴隶
for willingly entering into the last legal form of slavery...

1177
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,507
可他看上去总是异常高兴
he always looks really, really happy.

1178
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,545
不知怎么搞的 我...
And, for some reason, I

1179
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:53,547
你干嘛这么看着我?
What the hell are you looking at me like that for?

1180
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,117
你是在讽刺我吗?      什么意思？
 Are you shitting me right now?　　　　 What?

1181
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:58,949
那是我最爱的部分
That's my favorite part.

1182
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,190
老天 我们居然有共同点
Oh, my God. We have something in common.

1183
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,959
对 从统计学上说 那是一定的
Yes. Well, statistically that was bound to happen.

1184
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:10,658
你得承认自己是个大傻瓜
Uhhuh. I think you should just admit that you're a big softy.

1185
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:13,964
你那些愤世嫉俗都是装的 让你自己看起来
That this whole cynical thing is just an act so that you can seem...

1186
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,937
很受伤 神秘 性感
wounded and mysterious and sexy.

1187
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:19,974

 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that last one?　　　　 What?

你是说性感吗?      什么?
 Did you say sexy?　　　　 What?

1189

 Do you think I'm sexy?　　　　 No.

1190
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,739
你这么想很合情理      我没有
 It's okay if you do. You think I'm sexy?　　　　 I don't.

1191
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:29,647
不 你自以为很性感 这得说清楚
No. I think you think you're sexy. That's the point I'm making.

1192
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:32,482
你认为我自认很性感?      没错
 You think I think I'm sexy?　　　　 Yes.

1195
01:08:43,032 --> 01:08:46,593
让它变成羽毛(歌词全都唱错了)
# Gotta make a feather #

1196
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:49,967
歌词不是这样的      就是这样的
 Those are not the words.　　　　 Those are exactly the words.

1197
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:52,734
抱歉 歌词刑警 歌词是什么来着?
Sorry, lyric police. What are the words?

1198
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:55,811
你会听到令人绝倒的音乐
#You're gonna hear a handsome music #

1199
01:08:55,912 --> 01:08:58,244
像是海象的声音
# So the walrus sounds #

1200
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:00,247
"海象的声音"?

I had no idea he was writing an article about me.

You? He called me "Bridezilla" in the New York Frickin' Journal!

1279
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:16,929
我发誓要把他撕成碎片 我要把他大卸八块
I could tear him apart, I swear. I could tear him apart limb from limb.

1280
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:22,400
干嘛?      能让简接电话吗？
 What?　　　　 Can I speak to Jane, please?

1281
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:27,067
有什么话找我的律师去说吧!
The only person that you're gonna be speaking to is my attorney!

1282
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,736
我现在还没有律师 但我保证会有的!
And I don't even have an attorney, but I'm sure gonna get one!

1283
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,575
你这个混蛋!
Asshole!

1284
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,950
我要离开这
I gotta get outta here.

1285
01:14:37,052 --> 01:14:39,748
你最好注意交通安全
Oh, but you better alert Traffic Control...

1286
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,755
因为新娘哥斯拉被放出来了!
because Bridezilla's on the loose!

1287
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:55,394
凯文 凯文
Kevin Kevin

1288
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:58,905
凯文 别再给我打电话了!
Kevin, stop calling me!

1289
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:09,378
在你说话之前 能不能保持沉默?
Before you say anything, can you just not say anything?

1290
01:15:11,153 --> 01:15:13,144
我不懂
I don't understand.

1291
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:15,621
你指什么?
To what are you referring?

1292
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:18,683
别这样 没什么大不了的
Oh, come on. It's no big deal.

1293
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:22,127
只是一篇头版的文章..
It's just an article... on the front page of the section...

1294
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,722
几张你的照片
with a million pictures of you on it.

1295
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:27,394
谁会在意?     简
 Who's upset?　　　　 Jane.

1296
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:39,205
听我解释 我不知道他在写什么
Let me just explain. I had no idea what he was writing.

1297
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:42,876
简 这家伙是个混蛋 他利用了你
Jane, the guy was a jerk. Okay? He took advantage of you.

1298
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:46,284
别担心      我知道 只觉得自己早该料到
Don't worry about it.　　　　 I know. I just I feel like I should've seen it coming.

1299
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:49,653
抱歉      别再道歉了 行吗?
 I'm so sorry.　　　　 Would you please stop apologizing?

1300
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,751
我叫你进来只是想看看你是否还好
The only reason I called you in here was to make sure that you're okay.

1301
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:58,856
哦 好多了
Oh. Well, I've been better.

1302
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,999
我正试着不去想它
I'm just trying to get through it.

1303
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:05,039
瞧 我完全不担心 对吧?
Look. I wouldn't worry about it, all right?

1304
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,735
不是每个人都会看那个板块 嗯？      对
Does anybody read that section anyhow?　　　　 No.

1305
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,010
缝好后 我不会...
So after we hem it, I wouldn't

1306
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,451
简 是你吗?     对
Jane, is that you?　　　　 Yep.

1307
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:21,887
我们稍候再说 嗨      嗨      
 We'll talk about it after. Hi.　　　　 Hi.

1308
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:23,515
你好 苏      你好
 Hi, Sue.　　　　 Hi.

1309
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,618
听着 关于那篇可耻的文章我想了很久
So, listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking about the article fiasco...

1310
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,629
我决定原谅你
and I've decided to forgive you.

1311
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:30,756
恩      你只是太轻信别人了      
 Mmm.　　　　 You're just very trusting...

1312
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,993
这不是你的错      嗯
 and it's not your fault, I guess.　　　　 Mmkay.

1313
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:35,036
泰斯 你真是大度
That's very big of you, Tess. Thank you.

1314
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:37,537
等等 你核对名单了吗?
Wait. Are you checking me off your list?

1315
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,438
放幻灯片的时候 我要知道你都说些什么
Um, about the slide show, I know exactly what I want you to say.

1316
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:43,943
我写了份草稿 爸爸说你有所有的家庭照片
So I wrote out a script. And Dad says that you have all the family photos.

1317
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,241
对      对 我会把乔治的照片也给你
 Yep. Mmhmm.　　　　 So I'm gonna send you George's as well.

1318
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:50,707
看这里 就说这些
Um, here. Please say this and only this.

1319
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:54,948
我们可不想再尴尬了      好 我懂了
 'Cause we don't want to be embarrassed again.　　　　 Okay. You got it.

1320
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:57,116
来了
Here it is.

1321
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:59,786
站进来       好
 Step in.　　　　 Okay.

1322
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,795
好了      就这样   
 Yep.　　　　 There you go.

1323
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:06,468
真漂亮       你得解开后背的纽扣      
 It's beautiful.　　　　 You might have to unbutton that back.

1324
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:09,401
等一下      好了
 One second.　　　　 Okay.

1325
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,975
完美至极 觉得如何?
Perfect. So what do you think?

1326
01:17:15,778 --> 01:17:17,803
我以为你要穿妈妈的婚纱
I I thought you were wearing Mom's dress.

1327
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:21,747
是她的婚纱 不过是一部分
It is Mom's dress. Well, parts of it.

1328
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:26,617
那件太老气了 所以我们进行了一番裁减
It was just so oldfashioned,you know? So we could just use a few pieces here and there.

1329
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,917
部分?      对
 Parts?　　　　 Mmhmm. Yeah.

1330
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:31,424
像这里 还有这个花边
Like this, and the lace.

1331
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,934
你剪了妈妈的婚纱?
You cut up Mom's wedding dress?

1332
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:42,697
从技术上来说 是玛丽埃拉剪的
Well, technically MaryElla did.

1333
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,171
不过别担心 剩下的我们帮你留着
But don't worry. We saved you the rest.

1334
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:48,766
如果你喜欢 可以穿这件
And, I mean, if you want,you can wear this...

1335
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:52,643
只要这个式样还流行
as long as a silhouette's still in fashion.

1336
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:56,275
玛丽埃拉 我觉得下面还得缝一缝
MaryElla, I think just the bottom needs to be hemmed a little bit.

1337
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:58,649
不 不 不
No. No, no, no, no.

1338
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:01,382
不!
No!

1339
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:04,186
好吧 你可以不穿
Okay, fine. You don't have to wear it.

1340
01:18:04,293 --> 01:18:05,378
你根本不在乎
God, you don't care.

1341
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:06,853
除了自己之外你谁都不在乎 对吧?
You don't care about anyone but yourself, do you?

1342
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:08,925
我一直为你找借口 因为妈妈去世时你还小
I have made excuses for you because Mom died when you were little.

1343
01:18:08,925 --> 01:18:10,295
但你得适可而止了
But enough is enough!

1344
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,675
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1345
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:14,612
你的所作所为我无法挽回
I can't undo what you've just done.

1346
01:18:14,612 --> 01:18:15,675
但我不会让你伤害乔治
But I won't let you hurt George.

1347
01:18:15,675 --> 01:18:19,472
他觉得了解你 但他了解到的只是你的谎言
He thinks he knows the truth about you, but all he knows are the lies you've told him.

1348
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,408
你还叫佩德罗瞒着乔治
You even had Pedro keep a secret from George.

1349
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:24,502
你现在就去告诉他真相!
You tell him the truth right now!

1350
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,425
他和你的那些垃圾欧洲男友不一样
He is not one of your Eurotrash boyfriends, Tess.

1351
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:27,741
他是个好人
He is a good person.

1352
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:30,512
你不能把爱情建立在谎言之上
And you cannot start a relationship based on lies.

1353
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:31,925
真的吗 简? 
Oh, really,Jane?

1354
01:18:31,925 --> 01:18:34,885
你如此了解是因为你那些成功的经验之谈?
And you know this because of all your successful relationships?

1355
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:38,484
如果你不去告诉他真相 那么我去说
You tell him the truth, or I will.

1356
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:41,175
不 你不会 你连只苍蝇都不会伤害
No, you won't. You wouldn't hurt a fly.

1357
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,496
更不会伤害我
And you definitely wouldn't hurt me.

1358
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:45,260
我是你妹妹     已经是过去式了
 I'm your sister.　　　　 That was yesterday.

1359
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:46,050
今天你只是一个伤了我心
Today you're just some bitch

1360
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,825
剪了妈妈婚纱的婊子
who broke my heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress.

1361
01:18:50,506 --> 01:18:52,565
反正这件婚纱也不适合你穿
Well, it wouldn't have fit you anyway.

1362
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:15,254
简 你看起来棒极了
Oh,Jane. You look wonderful.

1363
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:17,264
祝贺你
Good for you.

1364
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:21,735
亲爱的 看着妹妹先你一步结婚一定不容易
Oh, honey, it must be so hard to watch your younger sister get married before you.

1365
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:24,203
是的 的确如此
Yes. Yes, it is.

1366
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:27,673
但是想到我还能和别人一夜情
But then I remember that I still get to have hot hate sex with random strangers...

1367
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:30,301
感觉好多了
and I feel so much better.

1368
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:32,312
祝你过得愉快
Enjoy the party.

1369
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:37,616
噢! 你打扮得不错 我没准会对你感兴趣
Whoo! You clean up good. I might even be into you.

1370
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:41,655
好的 文件在"泰斯和乔治"的文件夹里面
 Okay. It's on the desktop under "Tess and George."

1371
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:43,657
还好吗?      很好
 You okay?　　　　 Yep.

1372
01:19:45,027 --> 01:19:48,121
这不是水
That's not water. Okay.

1373
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,130
很好
Okay.

1374
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:55,463
嗨
Hi.

1375
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:58,175
简 谢谢你为我们所做的一切 真的很棒
Jane, thank you so much for doing all this. It's great.

1376
01:19:58,175 --> 01:19:58,631
不用客气
Sure.

1377
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,765
开胃菜?      哦 瞧啊 小热狗
 Hors d'oeuvre?　　　　 Yeah. Oh, look. Pigs in a blanket.

1378
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:06,314
来一个 泰斯?      不 我不吃那玩意 
 Want one, Tess?　　　　 No. I don't eat that stuff,Jane.

1379
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:12,153
对 明白了
Right. That's right. Got it.

1380
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:19,959
我要去放幻灯片了
Well, I'm gonna go do the slide show.

1381
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:22,087
简      什么事?
Jane.　　　　 Mmm?

1382
01:20:23,565 --> 01:20:25,658
只要照着我写的说 知道了吗?
You're only gonna say what I wrote, right?

1383
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:29,259
当然 优秀的伴娘听从新娘的吩咐
Of course. The perfect bridesmaid always does what she's asked.

1384
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:40,805
不会临阵退缩了吧?
Not getting cold feet, are you?

1385
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:43,043
那是什么?      和他? 永远不会      
 What was that?　　　　 With this one? Never.

1386
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,614
嗨 各位
Hey, everybody.

1387
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,623
也许你们已经知道了...
In case you haven't already read...

1388
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:52,455
我参加过很多的婚礼
I have been to my fair share of weddings.

1389
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:57,527
在此之前...
So, to start things off...

1390
01:20:57,633 --> 01:21:00,534
我想大家都该知道泰斯和乔治的真相
I thought you should all know the truth about Tess and George.

1391
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:11,142
泰斯和乔治是完美的一对
"Tess and George are a perfect couple.

1392
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:13,441
不 是天生的一对
"No, a divine couple.

1393
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:15,847
他们的爱宛如神话一般
"A couple whose love is the stuff of myths.

1394
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:18,511
他们是如此的相像
"Their compatibility is so exact...

1395
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,750
只能用天作之合来形容
"that it can only be described as having been designed by the gods.

1396
01:21:22,858 --> 01:21:26,157
一张照片胜过千言万语...
Since a picture is worth a thousand words...

1397
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:29,196
我把照片做成了幻灯片 大家自己欣赏一番
I put together a slide show so you can all see for yourselves.

1398
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:38,369
从一开始 泰斯和乔治就注定为对方而生
"From the very beginning, Tess and George were destined for each other.

1399
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:46,170
乔治和泰斯都喜欢动物
"George and Tess have always shared a love of God's furry creatures.

1400
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:54,949
他们长大后 他俩在奉献 承诺
"As they grew up, they both shared the same level of dedication and commitment...

1401
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:58,458
教育方面水平相当
"to their education.

1402
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:04,888
很好      还有作为市民的责任感      
Nice.　　　　 "And civic responsibility.

1403
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,026
共享快乐
 #So happy together #

1404
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:13,099
他热衷于国际时事
"He was interested in international affairs.

1405
01:22:14,843 --> 01:22:16,242
她也是
"And so was she.

1406

哇哦

1407
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:23,442
今天 泰斯和乔治有着相同的价值观
"And today, Tess and George still share the same values.

1408
01:22:25,187 --> 01:22:28,554
我和你 你和我
#Me and you and you and me #

1409
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:31,956
他们的爱建立在深厚的理解基础之上
"Their love is based on a deep understanding...

1410
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:36,429
并且能接受最真实的对方
"and acceptance of who the other person really is.

1411
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:41,400
幸福的生活在一起
#So happy together #

1412
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:44,301
吧啦 吧啦
#Bah, bah, bah, bah #

1413
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:50,803
两个真正的灵魂伴侣
"The love of two true soul mates...

1414
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:53,380
泰斯和乔治
"Tess and George.

1415
01:22:57,862 --> 01:23:02,613
这就是天造地设的一对
So here's to the most perfect couple brought together by destiny.

1416
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:04,885
为你感到自豪 我的小妹妹
I'm so proud of you, Baby Sister.

1417
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:09,192
好了 好了
Okay. Okay.

1418
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:12,131
好吧 那真是...
All right. Well, that was

1419
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:15,761
嗯...
Yeah. So, um...

1420
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:20,365
欢乐乔治的"小兄弟"佩德罗...
to keep the merriment going, um, George's "little brother" Pedro...

1421
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:22,204
他有一些话要说
wanted to say a few words.

1422
01:23:22,311 --> 01:23:24,302
佩德罗
Pedro.

1423
01:23:24,413 --> 01:23:27,382
告诉我你不是素食主义者也没关系
So, safe to say you're not a vegetarian.

1424
01:23:27,482 --> 01:23:30,974
乔治 那是很久以前的事了
George, that was taken a really long time ago.

1425
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:33,884
那你为什么还带着订婚戒指?
Why exactly were you wearing your engagement ring then?

1426
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:35,889
谢谢大家
Thank you.

1427
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:37,822
大家都知道 乔治是我的哥哥
As all you know, George is my big brother.

1428
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:40,486
不止这些
But he's more than that.

1429
01:23:40,595 --> 01:23:42,495
他是我最好的朋友
He's my best friend.

1430
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:47,034
现在乔治有了泰斯 她真的非常酷
And now George has Tess, who's who's reallyreally, really cool...

1431
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:50,798
因为她帮助我开创自己的清洁事业
'cause she's gonna help me start my own cleaning business.

1432
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:54,000
乔治 泰斯让我别告诉你的
Oh. Tess told me not to tell you, George.

1433
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:56,202
但是我太激动了
But I'm so excited.

1434
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:58,506
现在我只负责打扫乔治的家
So I'm only doing George's place right now.

1435
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:02,140
如果在座的各位需要清洁服务
But if anyone is in the market for a really good cleaning service...

1436
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,878
可以到大厅来找我
please see me in the lobby.

1437
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:07,045
谢谢大家
Thank you.

1438
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:10,215
真不错      不 不是这样的 乔治
 That's great.　　　　 No, it's it's not. George.

1439
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:16,754
乔治 等等 听我解释
George, wait, please. Let me explain.

1440
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:20,096
怎么了?
So what happened?

1441
01:24:22,003 --> 01:24:25,871
他得知道真相      你本可私下告诉他的
 He needed to know the truth.　　　　 You could've told him facetoface.

1442
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:29,501
我知道自己的道德指针也有偏差
I mean, I know that my moral compass doesn't exactly point due north...

1443
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:33,945
但如果我说这件事错了 那就真出了问题
but if I say something's wrong, something's wrong.

1444
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:39,186
是你总是告诉我要为自己而战
You're the one who is always telling me to stand up for myself.

1445
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:41,175
没错 但你表现的并非如此
Yeah. But that's not what you did.

1446
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:45,084
你就像是压抑了20年的感情一夜暴发
What you did was unleash 20 years of repressed feelings in one night.

1447
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:47,093
这很有娱乐效果 别误解我的意思
It was entertaining don't get me wrong

1448
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:50,858
如果你做的对 应该感到舒服了不少
but if it was the right thing to do, you'd feel better right now.

1449
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,368
现在你觉得好多了吗?
Do you feel better right now?

1450
01:24:57,038 --> 01:25:00,405
婚礼取消了 希望你满意了
The wedding's off. I hope you're happy.

1451
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:31,596
哦 上帝 干嘛?
Oh, God. What?

1452
01:25:31,706 --> 01:25:33,606
你怎么在这里?
Why are you here?

1453
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,233
你不回我电话      你想怎么样?
 You wouldn't return my phone calls.　　　　 What do you want?

1454
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:38,574
还要为你的稿子采风吗?
You want another picture for your paper?

1455
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,363
简 对不起 相信我
Jane, I'm sorry. Believe me.

1456
01:25:40,363 --> 01:25:43,174
得了吧 你利用我达到事业的顶峰     
Please. You used me to get ahead in your career.

1457
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,651
是男人的话就承认吧 要么就别来烦我
Be a man and admit it. Or Or don't.

1458
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:49,121
别再假装你在乎了
But please, please don't pretend that you give a shit.

1459
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:51,954
让我解释      不 这不重要
 Will you just please let me explain?　　　　 No, it doesn't matter.

1460
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:56,554
我已经毁了我的生活 用不着你煽风点火
I just destroyed my life, and I didn't need your help to do it.

1461
01:25:56,665 --> 01:25:59,031
好极了
Great! Finally.

1462
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:01,816
我刚才看到了 我认为那很好
I saw what you did in there. And you know what? I thought it was amazing.

1463
01:26:01,816 --> 01:26:05,635
我是认为那很疯狂 但你最终做到了 简
Was it absolutely, certifiably nuts? Yes, it was. But you did something,Jane.

1464
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:09,073
第一次 你不再仅仅是一个完美的伴娘
 For the first time,you were not just the perfect bridesmaid.

1465
01:26:09,177 --> 01:26:12,806
别再说了 我都不知道为什么和你说话
I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even know why I'm standing here talking to you.

1466
01:26:12,914 --> 01:26:15,815
听着
You know what? Let me tell you. Look. Come here. Listen to me.

1467
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:19,284
你知道我今晚为什么来吗?
Do you want to know the real reason why I came here tonight?

1468
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:21,412
我知道这对你很难
Because I knew this was gonna be hard for you.

1469
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:25,687
很久以来 我第一次想成为某个人的依靠
And for the first time in a really long time, I wanted to be there for somebody. Yeah.

1470
01:26:25,794 --> 01:26:29,195
我做错了 是我的错 我承认
All right. I messed up. I did. I'm sorry.

1471
01:26:29,297 --> 01:26:31,316
我会转身就走 立刻消失 
And I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna walk away. I'm gonna vanish.

1472
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:34,769
你再也不会看到我 我保证
You'll never see me again, I promise.

1473
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:37,964
但我想让你知道
But I want you to know that I think you deserve

1474
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:41,372
我觉得你该得到比你现在拥有的更多的东西
I think you deserve more than what you've settled for.

1475
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:45,810
我觉得你值得被珍视
I do. I think you deserve to be taken care of for a change.

1476
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:48,007
我真的这么想
I I believe that.

1477
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:03,391
我忘了给你这个
I forgot to give you this.

1478
01:27:03,498 --> 01:27:06,128
是个礼物
It's a gift...

1479
01:27:06,128 --> 01:27:10,063
你不必再随身带着那个1987年出厂的古董
so you don't have to carry around that crazy Filofax from 1987.

1480
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:13,902
你可以用这个计划你要做的所有事
This will take care of all the stuff you need to do.

1481
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:17,103
重新开始的工具
Perfect for starting over.

1482
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:26,516
请收下吧  不然我觉得自己真是个混蛋
Okay. Will you take it, please, so I don't feel like such a jerk?

1483
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:52,646
不要让你的心思变得疲倦 困惑
#Don't let your mind get weary and confused #

1484
01:27:52,747 --> 01:27:57,184
你的意愿依然 不要尝试
# Your will be still Don't try #

1485
01:28:04,192 --> 01:28:09,459
孩子 不要让你的心变得沉重 
#Don't let your heart get heavy, child, inside you #

1486
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:12,795
谎言的力量
# There's a strength that lies #

1487
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:20,966
那篇报道反响极佳
The story got a phenomenal response.

1488
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:24,204
看来你得到自己的专栏了
 Looks like you got yourself bumped from Commitments.

1489
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,946
太好了
That's great.

1490
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:30,540
开心点 
Kevin, be happy.

1491
01:28:30,652 --> 01:28:33,177
你得到了你想要的 不是吗

1492
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:37,349
孩子 不要让你的心变得孤单 
#Don't let your soul get lonely, child #

1493
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:42,487
时间会让一切过去
#It's only time it will go by ##

1494
01:28:46,234 --> 01:28:48,759
我说的是 你们是姐妹 
All I'm saying is you two are sisters.

1495
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,550
你们得好好谈谈     但她不想和我谈
You have got to work this out.　　　　 I'm telling you, she doesn't want to talk.

1496
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:55,410
不 她爱你 一切都会好的 
No, no. She loves you. Everything is gonna be fine.

1497
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:57,774
只要你...     爸爸
 Okay. If you just　　　　 Dad?

1498
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:03,565
她在这里做什么       
What the hell is she doing here?

1499
01:29:03,565 --> 01:29:06,311
泰斯 这是你们两个人之间的事
Tess, this is between you and her.

1500
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:08,321
跟我无关
I'm out of this.

1501
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:13,019
你看过新款的除草剂吗
You know, Flo, have you seen the new weed whackers we've got out front?

1502
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:15,995

我对所发生的事道歉       道歉?
 I'm so sorry for what happened　　　　 Sorry?

1505

You humiliated me in front of every single person that I know...

1506
01:29:29,711 --> 01:29:31,679
你觉得道个歉就好了
and you think you could just say sorry?

1507
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:35,216
我知道       简 你总是嫉妒我
 II know. But　　　　 Jane,you were always jealous of me.

1508

 Stop it!　　　　 You've just been waiting for the chance to tear me down.

1510
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,113
不是这样的     就是这样!
That's not true.　　　　 Yes, it is!

1511
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:46,855
你拿走了我一生中最重要的东西
And you took the one thing that was finally working out.

1512
01:29:46,855 --> 01:29:48,861
这真是太像你了
Oh, please! This is so typical, Tess.

1513
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:52,330
你不负责任 不承认你向乔治撒谎这个事实
You're not taking any responsibility for the fact that you lied to George.

1514

1516
01:29:57,605 --> 01:30:00,233

Did you even love him? Or was it just convenient?

1517
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:03,678
算了吧 简 别长篇大论了
Oh, please,Jane. Get off your high horse.

他待我很好  知道吗
And he treated me well, you know?

1533
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:49,690
我想成为他心目中的那个人
And I just wanted to be someone that he wanted.

1534
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:51,999
成为配得上他的 
I was trying to be someone who deserved him...

1535
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:55,560
受他尊敬的人
someone he could respect.

1536
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:58,325
我想成为你
I was trying to be you.

1537
01:31:00,034 --> 01:31:02,059
为什么?
Why?

1538
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,139
为什么你想成为我  你就是你
Why would you want to be me when you get to be you?

1539
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:11,974
事情太乱了      我知道
 This is a mess.　　　　 I know.

1540
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,760
简     妈妈去世后你就一直照顾我
Jane, you've been trying to take care of me ever since Mom died.

1541
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,430
我必须照顾你      不 你不必的
 I had to.　　　　 No, you didn't have to.

1542
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:22,484
但如果我不照顾你      如果你不照顾我
But But if I don't then　　　　 But if you don't...

1543
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,822
你就只是我的姐姐 那才是正常的
then you'll just be my sister, which is what it should be.

1544
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:29,863
也许我小的时候你得照顾我 但现在 
Maybe when I was young you needed to help me out. But now?

1545
01:31:29,964 --> 01:31:31,955
别再为我操心了
You gotta stop taking care of me...

1546
01:31:32,066 --> 01:31:34,466
还有其他人
of everybody.

1547
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,812
你好 嗨
Hello? Hi.

1548
01:32:29,324 --> 01:32:31,258
好的
Yeah.

1549
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:33,259
没问题
Yeah. It's no problem. No, of course.

1550
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:36,489
我马上来
Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay. Okay, bye.

1551
01:32:52,714 --> 01:32:55,547
你看起来真漂亮
You look You look great.

1552
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,253
你终于能在下班后出去约会了
So I guess you did need to find me a date for this benefit after all.

1553
01:33:00,253 --> 01:33:03,056
是的
I guess so.

1554
01:33:03,157 --> 01:33:04,175
乔治  在我们出去之前
George, before we go anywhere,

1555
01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:05,785
我想先为昨晚的事道歉
I just want to apologize for last night.

1556
01:33:05,894 --> 01:33:07,830
我不该那样做
I shouldn't have done what I did.

1557
01:33:07,896 --> 01:33:09,989
你帮了我个忙
Look, you did me a favor.

1558
01:33:10,098 --> 01:33:13,124
和一个认识不久的人仓促结婚是我的错
All right, it's not your fault I was about to marry someone I barely knew.

1559
01:33:13,234 --> 01:33:15,828
我到底想什么呢
I mean, what the hell was I thinking, right?

1560
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:21,569
不如我们忘了这件事吧     如果你不介意
 So what do you say we forget the whole thing?　　　　 Okay. If you're sure.

1561
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:24,907
我没事     我想再请你帮我个忙
I'm sure. Now, I hate to ask you for another favor...

1562
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:27,112
今晚我要打印我的演讲词
but I need to print up my speech for tonight,

1563
01:33:27,112 --> 01:33:28,244
但是我找不到文件了
and I cannot find the file.

1564
01:33:28,244 --> 01:33:30,647
我来找好了
Oh, yeah. I can get it.

1565
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:34,483
简 谢天谢地我能给你打电话
Jane, I am so thankful that I could call you tonight.

1566
01:33:34,589 --> 01:33:38,286
我总能指望你 你从来不拒绝
I can always count on you. You never say no.

1567
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:40,827
我很欣赏
Which I love.

1568
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:44,894
什么?
What?

1569
01:33:44,999 --> 01:33:47,991
我只是说
Well, I I just meant

1570
01:33:48,102 --> 01:33:50,002
我说错什么了吗?
I'm sorry. Did I Did I say something wrong?

1571
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:55,332
哦 天呐
Oh, God.

1572
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:58,173
乔治 我辞职
George, I quit.

1573
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,179
是的
Yeah.

1574
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:02,749
我辞职      你辞职是什么意思
 I quit.　　　　 What do you mean, you quit?

1575
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:06,560
我被这个公司和你吸引到这里
When I came here after college, I was blown away by this company and by you.

1576
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,749
但却忙得没时间顾及自己的私生活
And I got so caught up in the job that I never bothered to get my own life.

1577
01:34:09,857 --> 01:34:11,757
我曾以为离开很容易
I think I got too comfortable to leave.

1578
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:13,112
但我又不得不每天来这里
Then I had to be here every day to see you

1579
01:34:13,112 --> 01:34:15,852
因为我疯狂爱上了你
because I was so madly in love with you.

1580
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,099
是的 太可怕了 
Yeah. Horrible.

1581
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:23,102
真是疯了
Crazy Crazy crush. Crazy.

1582
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:27,031
你会没事的  乔治
But you'll be fine, George.

1583
01:34:27,141 --> 01:34:29,371
你会找到代替我的人
You will. You'll get somebody in this position...

1584
01:34:29,477 --> 01:34:33,846
在那个职位上不要超过2年 这才是正确的
who will stay for two years max, because that's what's acceptable and appropriate for this

1585
01:34:45,393 --> 01:34:47,293
对不起 
I I'm sorry. Really sorry.

1586
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:50,222
我不知道 就像...      没关系  
I don't know. It just kind of, like, all of a sudden.　　　　 No. It's okay.

1587
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:53,300
我一直想知道那是什么感觉
I've always wanted to know what that would feel like.

1588
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:57,133
那么
And?

1589
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:59,798
我什么也没感觉到
 Nothin'. I didn't feel a thing.

1590
01:34:59,907 --> 01:35:02,432
真伤人
That hurts.

1591
01:35:02,543 --> 01:35:05,376
那再试一次?     好的 可以
MayMaybe we can give it another try. Okay.　　　　 Yeah. Okay.

1592
01:35:12,854 --> 01:35:14,879
不 还是没感觉 你呢?
Nope. Not even a blip. You?

1593
01:35:14,989 --> 01:35:18,238
说实话 也没有
Mmm. If I'm being honest, not really.

1594
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:21,519
不该是这样的
Yeah. That's not what it's supposed to feel like.

1595
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:23,731
如果是你命中注定的那个 
When you're with the person you're meant to be with...

1596
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:25,722
应该是...
it should feel like

1597
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,801
什么声音
Wait. What is that?

1598
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:36,276
我要走了
I gotta go.

1599
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:41,550
你认为我们可以请几天病假
How many sick days do you think we can

1600
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:42,873
而不至于惹麻烦?
really take without getting in trouble?

1601
01:35:42,984 --> 01:35:47,580
如果连着请四天 就能休息一礼拜 去坎昆玩
If we took four in a row, we could take a whole week off and go down to, like, Cancun.

1602
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:49,690
抱歉 打扰一下
Excuse me. Hello?

1626
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:41,630
多说点 多说点

1633
01:38:01,355 --> 01:38:04,518
我只想告诉你 
Uh, I just wanted to say...

1634
01:38:04,518 --> 01:38:07,025
你是对的 一直都是 
that you were right about me, about all of it.

1635
01:38:07,025 --> 01:38:10,529
我只是听不进去 特别是对你说的话
I just didn't want to hear it, especially not from you.

1636
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:15,734
能开个聚光灯吗
Can we get a follow spot?

1637
01:38:17,471 --> 01:38:20,406
你在那儿啊

1640
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:28,243
然后你出现了
and then you showed up.

1641
01:38:28,349 --> 01:38:30,510
你跟我想象中完全不同
And you are nothing like the man I imagined.

1642
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,987
你愤世嫉俗
You're cynical...

1643
01:38:32,987 --> 01:38:36,787
尖刻  任性
and cranky and impossible.

1644
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:40,327
但事实上和你吵架
But the truth is, fighting with you...

1645
01:38:40,428 --> 01:38:42,521
是我经历过的最好的事
is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1646
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:46,862
我想我可能爱上你了
And I think there's a very good chance that I'm falling in love with you.

1647
01:38:49,804 --> 01:38:54,542
就是这样 
So... that's it.

1648
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:58,970
这就是我要说的 我走了
That's all I had to say. So... I'll go now.

1649
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,316
抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

1650
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:13,617
凯文 我...
Kevin, I just really, um

1651
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:21,328
快过来
Get over here.

1652
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:38,876
我想知道这是为何
#I wonder why it is #

1653
01:39:38,986 --> 01:39:43,286
我不想和任何人这样争吵
#I don't argue like this #

1654
01:39:43,391 --> 01:39:48,385
除了你
# With anyone but you #

1655
01:39:50,464 --> 01:39:54,423
我想知道这是为何
#I wonder why it is #

1656
01:39:54,535 --> 01:39:58,734
我不会放松警惕 一年后 
#I won't let my guard down #

1657
01:39:58,839 --> 01:40:01,899
除了你
#For anyone but you ##

1658
01:40:02,009 --> 01:40:05,069
告诉我 你觉得这个婚礼特别吗?
So Tell me, what do you think makes this wedding special?

1659
01:40:05,179 --> 01:40:08,910
你是谁?     我为报纸写报道
 Who are you?　　　　 I write the Commitments column for the Journal.

1660
01:40:09,016 --> 01:40:11,610
一会能请你喝一杯吗?     到吧台等着  
 Maybe I could buy you a drink later.　　　　 It's an open bar.

1661
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:14,688
也许我会请你喝一杯　　　太棒了
Maybe I'll buy you a drink.　　　　 Yes!

1662

你好     谢谢 
Hi.　　　　 Thank you.

1663
01:40:19,627 --> 01:40:21,890
性感的泰斯
God, look at how hot Tess looks.

1664
01:40:22,663 --> 01:40:25,689
她会喜欢我吗? 我大了一岁
Think she'd go for me? I am a year older.

1665
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,258
不知道 我会为你说好话的
I don't know. I'll put in the good word for you, big guy. All right?

1666
01:40:31,806 --> 01:40:34,001
你好     嘿 
Hello.　　　　 Hi.

1667
01:40:34,108 --> 01:40:37,737
我是伴娘
Um, I'm the maid of honor.

1668
01:40:37,845 --> 01:40:41,160
我和室友住在威廉堡
I, um, live in Williamsburg with a roommate...

1669
01:40:41,248 --> 01:40:45,207
现在在设计手袋
and I just started designing my own line of deeply fabulous handbags.

1670
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:48,652
我破产了 不过没事
And I'm completely broke. But that's okay.

1671
01:40:48,756 --> 01:40:53,693
我一天只吃一个汉堡
I eat a hamburger a day, and my idea of a pet is a rock.

1672
01:40:54,795 --> 01:40:57,423
很高兴认识你     泰斯
 Well, it's very nice to meet you.　　　　 Tess.

1673
01:40:57,531 --> 01:41:00,500
泰斯 知道了
Tess. Got it.

1674
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:03,365
等会见见新娘吧 她很漂亮
Well, wait until you see the bride. She looks gorgeous.

1675
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:09,406
准备好了吗?
Ready?

1676
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,560
一切就绪
Everything's perfect.

1677
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,860
尤其是这裙子 把它改短了还能再穿
And this dress the best thing is I can shorten it and wear it again.

1678
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:16,815
太对了
Definitely. So true.

1679
01:41:16,917 --> 01:41:17,941
好了
All right.

1680
01:41:22,056 --> 01:41:24,251
好了吗?
Okay. Ready?

1681
01:41:24,358 --> 01:41:26,258
好了
Yes.

1682
01:41:52,653 --> 01:41:56,282
那天我穿上了第28套礼服
That day, I woke up and put on my 28th dress.

1683
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:59,450
我出席了一场没人让我拿花束
I went to a wedding where no one asked me to hold the bouquet...

1684
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,894
拿感言稿 提裙摆的婚礼
fold a place card or hold their dress while they peed.

1685
01:42:03,998 --> 01:42:06,796
一切都很完美 我都不在意
Everything was perfect. And I didn't care...

1686
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:10,337
因为对我来说最重要的
because right then, the only thing that mattered...

1687
01:42:10,438 --> 01:42:14,067
是在走道的那端等我的那个人
was the person waiting for me at the end of the aisle.

1688
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:16,939
用我一直期盼的目光注视着我
And he was looking at me the way I'd always hoped.

1689
01:42:32,426 --> 01:42:34,690
这就是你一直期待着的那一刻
So is this moment everything you hoped for?

1690
01:42:36,297 --> 01:42:37,764
不
No.

1691
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:42,633
比我期待的好 好太多了
It's more. It's much more.

1692
01:42:44,271 --> 01:42:47,172
两位恋人  我们在此集聚一堂
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...

1693
01:42:47,274 --> 01:42:51,904
见证简・尼克斯和凯文・道尔的婚礼
to join Jane Nichols and Kevin Doyle in holy matrimony.

1694
01:42:52,012 --> 01:42:54,300
婚姻让人喜悦
Marriage is a cause for celebration.

1695
01:42:56,817 --> 01:42:59,251
事实证明 我说对了一件事
It turns out I was right about one thing.

1696
01:43:00,855 --> 01:43:02,755
我知道她们总有一天会为我而聚在一起
I knew they'd all be there for me someday.
