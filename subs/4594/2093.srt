1
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:43,046
你是做什麼的
So, what do you do?

2
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:45,868
我在上課  想當個演員
I'm studying to be an actress.

3
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:46,210
你呢
You?

4
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,278
我是個碼頭工人
I'm a longshoreman.

5
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,131
我是說真的
No, I mean really.

6
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,133
我...我也是說真的
I mean... I mean really too.

7
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:53,301
不過從下週一開始
Although, starting next Monday,

8
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,094
我要做點兒更棒的事了
I'm doing something a little more glamorous.

9
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,262
什麼
What's that?

10
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:59,599
自助餐廳的夜班收銀員
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

11
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:02,030
我不是問你怎麼賺錢
I don't mean how you make money.

12
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:02,599
我是問
I mean,

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,520
你對什麼感興趣
What are you interested in?

14
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,066
親愛的  我要是有這答案
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,

15
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:11,277
我打賭不出半個小時咱倆都得無聊死
I bet I'd bore us both to death in half an hour.

16
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,070
謝天謝地  終於完了...
Thank God, that's over...

17
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,241
有很多明星都是初次亮相啊
So much for the debut of the laurel players.

18
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:01,577
她太讓人失望了
...And she was very disappointing.

19
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:09,625
弗蘭克
Oh, Frank!

20
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:10,955
太棒了  弗蘭克
Oh, very nice Frank!

21
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,172
謝謝你捧場  吉明斯夫人
Oh, thanks so much, Mrs. Givings.

22
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,327
我們真是太喜歡了
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.

23
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,843
你太太真有天賦
You have a very talented wife.

24
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:19,137
我會轉達的
I'll pass it along!

25
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,860
弗蘭克
Frank!

26
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:35,522
她在那邊...
She's in there...!

27
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,530
我等不及要喝一杯了
I'm about ready for that drink.

28
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:39,490
稍等一下
Couple of minutes!

29
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:49,832
愛寶?
April...?

30
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,335
寶貝兒?
Sweetheart...?

31
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:58,593
-準備好走了嗎  -好的  好的
-You about ready to leave?  -Yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:01,554
我正要卸妝
I've just got to get this makeup off.

33
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:10,049
那個...我猜
Well... I guess  it wasn't

34
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,065
不是很成功吧
A triumph or anything, was it?

35
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,177
我覺得是
I guess not.

36
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,849
我一會兒就好
I'll be ready in a minute.

37
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,531
不用著急
Take your time.

38
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,411
幫個忙好吧
Listen, will you do me a favor?

39
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,456
米莉和謝普想約我們出去
Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them after.

40
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,674
你能不能回絕了?
Will you say we can't?

41
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,043
就說保姆要下班什麼的
Say it's because of the baby sitter or something?

42
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,087
可是  我已經答應了
Well, the thing is, I already said that we could.

43
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:34,497
我...
I mean...

44
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,172
我剛才已經答應他們了
I just saw them and I said we would.

45
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,382
那你能否再出去一趟說剛才搞錯了呢
Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken?

46
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,592
這應該不難吧
That should be simple enough.

47
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,469
你不覺得這有點不禮貌嗎  愛寶
Don't you think that's a little bit rude, April?

48
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,045
好吧  我自己去說
Well I'll tell them myself.

49
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:43,443
好
Okay.

50
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:44,388
好  別急
Okay. Take it easy.

51
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:45,354
好吧
All right?

52
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,557
我去說
I'll tell them.

53
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,172
說真的  寶貝兒
I mean it, baby.

54
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,477
你是這戲裡唯一的亮點
You were the only person in that play.

55
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,062
謝謝
Thank you.

56
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:38,609
就不該讓你搞這破戲劇  這是關鍵
We should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing. It's all.

57
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:40,111
行了
All right.

58
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,223
一幫業餘的傢伙
A bunch of amateurs.

59
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:44,490
我是說  你可是科班出身
I mean, you've studied for Christ's sake.

60
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,950
能別嘮叨了嗎
Could we stop talking about it now?

61
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:47,076
好
Sure.

62
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,539
我只是不想讓你太難過
I just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all,

63
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,708
太不值得了
Because it's not worth it, you know?

64
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:57,420
-和這幫鳥人生活在這兒就夠憋屈了  -是
-It's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people -Yes.

65
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,714
-你說什麼  -我說"是"  弗蘭克
-What'd you say?  -I said yes. All right, Frank.

66
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:02,556
能別再說這個了嗎
Could you just stop talking about it now,

67
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:04,844
免得把我逼瘋
Before you drive me crazy, please?

68
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,808
你幹嗎
What are you doing?

69
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:20,272
愛寶
April...

70
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,124
親愛的
Sweetheart...

71
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,112
我們該談談
Let's talk about this, okay?

72
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,122
拜託  我不想談
Please, don't do that.

73
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:25,948
來
Come on now.

74
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,018
別碰我
Don't touch me.

75
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:27,950
愛寶  愛寶
April... April...

76
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,578
離我遠點兒
You just... Leave me alone!

77
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:38,135
好
Okay.

78
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,045
好
Okay.

79
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:43,438
我受夠了  這一堆狗屁爛事兒
It strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit...

80
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,217
這裡
Going on here,

81
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,925
我只想澄清幾件事
and there is just a few things, that I'd like to clear up.

82
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:47,386
好吧
All right?

83
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,396
第一
Number one:

84
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:52,099
這劇這麼噁心不是我的錯
It's not my fault the play was lousy.

85
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:52,839
第二
Number two:

86
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,477
你沒當成真正的演員
It's sure as hell not my fault

87
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,938
也他媽不是我的錯
That you didn't turn out to be an actress,

88
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:59,357
還有  你越快忘記那些肥皂劇
And the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera

89
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,650
我們就能過得越好
The better off we'll both be.

90
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,596
第三
Number three:

91
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,444
我不是那種
I don't happen to fit the role

92
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:06,447
木訥遲鈍的鄉下漢子
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband,

93
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,575
自從我們搬來這裡  你就一直想讓我變成那樣
You've been trying to leave that crap on me ever since we moved out here.

94
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,952
我受夠了
And I'm damn before wear.

95
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,716
第四
Number four:

96
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:14,967
愛寶
April...

97
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,040
愛寶
April!

98
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,335
愛寶
April...

99
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:21,963
你到底要幹嗎  快回來
What the hell are you doing? Get back to the car.

100
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:23,531
不  我一會兒回去
No. I will in a minute

101
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,758
讓我在這站會兒
Just let me stand here for a second.

102
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:27,468
媽的
Goddamnit.

103
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:31,249
愛寶
April...

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,642
你能不能回到車裡  我們好好談
Can you please, just get back in the car, and talk about this,

105
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,185
別在12號國道上亂跑好嗎
Instead of running all over Route 12?

106
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,896
我說得不夠清楚嗎  我不想談
Haven't I made it clear I don't particularly want to talk about it?

107
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,773
好吧  看在老天的份上
Okay. I mean, Jesus, I'm trying to be nice

108
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:42,858
我很想好好談談
about this thing. For God's sake.

109
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:43,951
你可真體貼
How kind of you.

110
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:46,028
太他媽的體貼了
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

111
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,613
等等  我做錯什麼啦
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.

112
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:50,323
你總是這麼絕對地說
You're always so wonderfully definite, on the subject of...

113
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:51,117
-你該怎樣不該怎樣  -等等
-What you do and don't deserve? -Wait a minute!

114
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,659
媽的  等等
Wait a goddamn...

115
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,746
愛寶  現在你聽我說
April, now you listen to me.

116
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:57,790
這一次
This is one time

117
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,959
你別想再曲解我的話  愛寶
You're not gonna get away with twisting everything that I say, April.

118
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,211
就這一次
This just happen to be one goddamn time.

119
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,005
我知道  我沒錯
I know I'm not the wrong here.

120
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,589
天哪  我真希望你今天沒來
Christ, I wish you'd stayed home tonight!

121
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:06,966
你知道現在的你怎麼了嗎  愛寶
You know what you are, when you are like this, April?

122
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,625
你有病
You're sick.

123
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:08,467
沒錯
I really mean that.

124
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,237
就是有病
You're sick!

125
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,928
-你知道你又怎麼了嗎  -怎麼
-And you know what you are? -What?

126
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:12,346
-你很噁心  -是嗎
-You're disgusting. -Oh yeah?

127
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,723
你別唬我  弗蘭克
You don't bully me, Frank.

128
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,891
就因為你把我困在這個安全的小陷阱裡
Just because you've got me safely in this little trap,

129
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,477
你以為你就能強迫我去感受你的感受嗎
You think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!

130
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,634
-陷阱  你說這是陷阱  -是  就是
-In a trap! You in a trap! -Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:21,105
-天哪  -我  弗蘭克  我
-Jesus! -Me, Frank. Me!

132
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,108
笑死我了
Don't make me laugh.

133
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,870
你這個可憐的自欺欺人的臭小子  看看你
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy. Look at you!

134
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:27,695
看看你
Look at you!

135
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,224
好好看看你自己再告訴我
Look at you and tell me,

136
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,365
你哪來的那麼多想像力
How by any stretch of the imagination

137
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,617
管自己叫男人
You can call yourself a man!

138
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,617
操
Fuck!

139
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,496
媽的
Damn!

140
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,874
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ!

141
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,403
別這麼看著我  愛寶
Don't look at me like that, April.

142
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,644
我們能回家了嗎
Could we please go home now?

143
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:40,844
革命之路

144
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:07,730
15層到了
Fifteenth floor.

145
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:24,163
老弟  今天你得幫幫我
I'm going to need your help this morning, Old Scout.

146
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:28,751
一會兒要是邦迪過來了  就馬上告訴我
For the next few hours, you're to warn me of Bandy's every approach

147
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:32,003
還有  別讓大家看見我
And you may need to shield me from public view in the likely event

148
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:34,715
胃疼的樣子
That avoid my stomach.

149
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,300
太難受了
It's that bad.

150
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,427
早  傑克
Morning, Jack.

151
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,804
看著吧  沒啥好事兒
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

152
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,870
你們一下火車我就知道你們要
Of course, I knew the moment you stepped off the train

153
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:05,955
找什麼
what you were looking for...

154
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,959
一小間改造穀倉或馬車庫房
A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house.

155
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,356
不過我得告訴你們
And I just hate to be the one to tell you

156
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,547
那種房子已經沒有了
That sort of thing just isn't available anymore...

157
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:17,174
不過別失望
But I don't want you to despair.

158
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,844
我要帶你們看個地方
There is one place up here I wanna show you...

159
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:25,015
這裡現在看起來是不怎麼樣
Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end.

160
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,936
你看  克勞福德路上的房子
As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little

161
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,407
都是很小的煤磚房  像個拖車屋
Cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places.

162
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,772
住著水管工
Plumbers, carpenters,

163
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,983
木匠之類的當地人
little local people of that sort.

164
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,568
但是...
But eventually...

165
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:38,703
與它相連的革命路
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road,

166
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,030
狀況可就大相逕庭了
Which is much nicer.

167
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:44,118
我要帶你們去的  是一幢漂亮的小房子
Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house

168
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,995
佈局很別緻
And a sweet little setting.

169
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,845
簡約清新的設計
Simple, clean lines,

170
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:50,874
有片很棒的草地  對孩子再合適不過了
Good lawns, marvelous for children.

171
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,377
就在前面的拐角處
It's just around this next curve...

172
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,918
你們馬上就要看到了
Now, you'll see it.

173
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,574
就是那兒
There.

174
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,010
看見那個白色的房子了嗎
See the little white one?

175
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,509
很討人喜歡吧
Sweet, isn't it?

176
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,940
看它神氣活現地佇立在小斜坡上
The perky way it sits there on its little slope?

177
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:06,432
很迷人吧
Charming, isn't it?

178
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:10,185
是啊
Oh, yes.

179
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,740
你找我?
You wanted to see me?

180
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:24,608
這是今天早晨從托萊多寄來的
Came for you from Toledo this morning.

181
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,118
這個月第3份了
This is the third one this month.

182
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:27,953
-抱歉  我已經很謹慎了...
-Sorry. I thought I'd taken care...

183
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,109
-我本以為
-I'm not prepared to have this...

184
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,039
不會再發生類似事情了  弗蘭克  明白嗎
This conversation again, Frank. You understand?

185
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:32,166
-我只是...
-I was literaly just getttin...

186
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,435
-週邊的其他分公司都很敬重我們
-These folks in the provinces look up to us.

187
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:35,628
我們得有效率
We need to be efficient.

188
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:38,422
我們不能總這麼反覆出錯
We can't have this kind of back and forth, and so forth.

189
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:41,383
太沒效率了
It's just not efficient.

190
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,662
我說的對吧
Am I Right?

191
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:43,302
完全正確
Yes.

192
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:46,912
怎麼了
What was that about?

193
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:47,640
托萊多
Toledo.

194
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:50,225
分店經理想要份
Branch manager wants a revised brochure

195
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,145
改好的諾克斯500會議的宣傳冊
For the conference on the Knox 500.

196
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:56,398
太沒效率了  我說的對吧  對吧  對吧
It's just not efficient. Am I right? Am I right? Am I right?

197
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,734
娘娘腔
Sounds like a goodie.

198
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,868
說實話  我都不知道諾克斯500是什麼
For God's sake. I don't even know what the Knox 500 does...

199
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,237
你知道嗎
Do you?

200
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:04,073
你以為都跟你似的
Don't insult me.

201
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:23,509
如果要找SP-1109下的待用文件
If you'll look in the inactive file under SP-1109.

202
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,887
你就能找著所有發給代理商的文件備份
You'll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency.

203
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:30,881
這樣我們就能追蹤到
And that way we can trace the thing back to its...

204
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,393
原始資料
To its original sources.

205
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:38,941
你午飯不會吃得太早吧
Listen. I hope you weren't planning on an early lunch.

206
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:39,570
不會
No.

207
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,569
我不太餓
I'm not really hungry.

208
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,988
好  我一會兒再過來
Good. I'll check on you later. All right?

209
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:45,851
好的
Okay.

210
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,532
好
Okay.

211
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,622
你知道嗎  莫林
You know something, Maureen?

212
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,959
碰上我算你走運
You're lucky you met me.

213
00:14:58,253 --> 00:14:59,712
怎麼說
Oh? How's that?

214
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,258
我能支你幾招
I think I can show you the ropes, you know.

215
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:07,451
在諾克斯生存的技巧
There's certain art to survival at Knox.

216
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:08,030
真的呀?
Really.

217
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,055
瞧著點兒
Let me show you what I mean.

218
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:11,380
服務生
Waiter.

219
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:15,769
把電話機拿來好嗎  再來兩杯馬提尼
Bring me the telephone would you? And two more Martinis.

220
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,157
請接克朗代克區55566  謝謝
Klondike 55566, please.

221
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:31,823
您好  喬根森夫人
Hello Mrs. Jorgensen.

222
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,147
我是弗蘭克·惠勒
Frank Wheeler here.

223
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:33,412
是的
Yes.

224
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:34,939
我想跟您說一聲
I just wanted to let you know,

225
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,623
我把莫林·格魯布派到
That I've had to send Maureen Grube

226
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,917
視覺輔助部辦點事兒
Down to Visual Aides for me.

227
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,283
恐怕這一下午她都得留下幫忙
I'll probably need her the rest of the afternoon.

228
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:42,546
好的
Yes.

229
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:44,628
您也是
You too.

230
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,966
再見
Take care now.

231
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,931
我都沒聽說過什麼視覺輔助
I've never even heard of Visual Aides.

232
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,579
那是因為...
That's because...

233
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,227
它壓根不存在
It doesn't exist.

234
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,813
你好  海倫
Hi, Helen.

235
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,126
快進來
Come on in.

236
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:23,086
我不久留了...
Oh, I can't stay a minute...

237
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:26,048
我就是來送這個景天草盆栽的
I just wanted to bring this sedum plantings

238
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,218
你能用它裝扮前院那小片凌亂的草地
For that messy patch down by the front yard.

239
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,094
就像歐洲石蓮花
It's like the European houseleek

240
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:34,807
它能開出可愛的小黃花
Only these have the most marvelous little yellow blossoms.

241
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:38,517
只要在開始的幾天澆上一點水
Now all it wants for the first few day is just a tiny dollop of water

242
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,771
它就能開得生機盎然
And you'll find it absolutely thrives.

243
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,857
太感謝你了  海倫  你太熱心了
Oh. Thank you, Helen. It's so kind of you.

244
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,777
要喝咖啡嗎
Would you like some coffee?

245
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:00,791
有什麼需要幫忙的嗎  海倫
Is there something I can do for you, Helen?

246
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,252
我差點兒忘了
Oh... I almost forgot.

247
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:06,964
我有點小事相求
There's a small favor I'd like to ask...

248
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,547
就關於...
It's about...

249
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:11,226
關於我兒子約翰的
It's about my son, John.

250
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,012
他住院了
He's been in the hospital.

251
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,473
真抱歉  他還好吧
Oh, I'm sorry. Is everything all right?

252
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:17,805
其實...
Well, actualy...

253
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:21,627
只是暫時的  他在布魯克醫院
It's just for the time being. He's in... Pleasent Brook.

254
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:22,563
是精神病院
Psychiatric.

255
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,411
我明白了
Oh, I see.

256
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,945
不嚴重
Oh... Nothing serious.

257
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,401
他只是有點抑鬱
He's just got a little run down.

258
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:35,617
總有一天會好起來的
Things can just get the better of us sometimes.

259
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,792
你說是吧
Don't you agree?

260
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:38,563
是的
Yes.

261
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:39,663
當然
Of course.

262
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,040
那裡設施很不錯
It's a marvellous facility.

263
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,002
治療也挺有效
And the treatments seem to be doing wonders for him...

264
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:47,713
不過  醫生說讓他出來放鬆一個下午
Anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon

265
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:50,299
可能對他有好處
Might do him a little bit good.

266
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:54,344
說實話  他覺得我的朋友都太保守了
I think he finds my friends a little conventional, quite frankly

267
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,764
我是說  他一直離家在外
I mean, he's travelled.

268
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,683
他是數學博士
He has a PhD in mathematics.

269
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:03,645
說他是個天才也不為過
I suppose you could say he's an intellectual.

270
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,899
讓他和你們這樣的年輕夫婦接觸
It would do him a world of good

271
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,567
會對他幫助很大的
To meet a young couple like you.

272
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,819
我們很高興認識他
We'd love to meet him.

273
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,828
真的?
Really?

274
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,782
是啊
Yes.

275
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,910
我們非常樂意
We'd love to.

276
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,330
謝謝你  親愛的
Thank you, dear.

277
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
謝謝
Thank you.

278
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:29,325
那個...
Well...

279
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:30,756
我得走了
I must be off.

280
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:44,811
我還記得你下火車那天的樣子
I remember the first day you came off the train.

281
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:47,154
你不像其他客戶
You weren't like my other clients.

282
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,357
你與眾不同
You were different.

283
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:51,693
你看上去...
You just seemed...

284
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:52,778
很特別
Special...

285
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,534
現在依然是
Of course you still are.

286
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,381
記得哦...
Remember...

287
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:05,999
澆一點兒水  我得趕緊走了  再見
Just a dollop. I must scoot. Toodle-oo.

288
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,130
再見
Bye.

289
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:31,775
你讓我醉醺醺的
I think you got me a little drunk.

290
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,618
知道今天什麼日子嗎
You know what today is?

291
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:42,953
不是星期一嗎
...Monday?

292
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,426
是我生日
It's my birthday.

293
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,210
我今天30歲了
I'm thirty years old today.

294
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:52,462
生日快樂
Happy birthday!

295
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:53,296
謝謝
Thank you.

296
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,543
你瞎編的那個部門
What was the name of that, um...

297
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:04,808
叫什麼來著
Department you made up again?

298
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,025
視覺輔助
Visual Aides.

299
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,194
太逗了
...What-a-joke.

300
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,923
太逗了
What-a-joke.

301
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,076
天啊
Oh my...

302
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:28,302
你想聽個真的笑話嗎
Do you wanna hear a real joke...?

303
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:28,790
想
Yes.

304
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,911
我老爸就在諾克斯工作
My old man worked at Knox.

305
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:34,463
是嗎
Yeah?

306
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,300
他在揚克斯市干推銷
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

307
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,426
有一年
Once a year,

308
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:45,849
他帶我進城吃午飯
He used to take me to the city for lunch.

309
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:49,770
那本該是個特別的傳道解惑的場合
It was supposed to be a very special, life-advice sort of occasion.

310
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:50,814
真不錯
Nice.

311
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,535
不
No.

312
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,856
不是的
Not really.

313
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57,319
我坐在那兒想
I used to sit there and think.

314
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:02,657
上帝  我求你別讓我像他那樣庸碌一生
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

315
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,244
現在  我坐在這兒
Now here I am,

316
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,999
一個30歲的諾克斯職員
A thirty year old Knox man.

317
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,253
你能有什麼法子
Can you beat that?

318
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,549
我想我沒太注意...
I think I kind of lost you...

319
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,013
你爸爸以前在諾克斯工作?
Your father worked for Knox...?

320
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:29,341
抱歉  我有點兒...
I'm sorry. Everything's kinda...

321
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:31,520
不能集中精神
...going out of focus

322
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:41,250
我們出去走走吧
Why don't we get some air?

323
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:42,614
我們倆
You with me

324
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:23,321
這是你嗎
Is this you?

325
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,658
是啊
Yeah.

326
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:28,222
你去過巴黎嗎
You've been to Paris?

327
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,620
我哪兒都沒去過
I've never really been anywhere.

328
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,832
那我該帶你去一次
Maybe I'll take you with me then.

329
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,127
只要有機會我就會回去的
I'm going back first chance I get.

330
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:36,751
我跟你說
I tell you.

331
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,494
那兒的人都朝氣蓬勃
People are alive there.

332
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:39,462
不像這裡
Not like here.

333
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,765
愛寶  我只知道...
All I know April is...

334
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:51,933
我想要體驗一切
I wanna feel things.

335
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,979
真真切切地去感受
Really feel them.

336
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,105
明白嗎
You know?

337
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,359
這算得上是野心嗎
How's that for an ambition...?

338
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,536
弗蘭克·惠勒
Frank Wheeler

339
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:08,621
我覺得  你是我見過的
I think you're the most interesting person

340
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,951
最有趣的男人
I've ever met.

341
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:21,963
我猜你今早上班時沒想到會這樣吧
Guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning?

342
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:24,257
是啊  真沒想到
No. It's really wasn't.

343
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:45,820
你有煙嗎  弗蘭克
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

344
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,823
當然
Yeah, sure.

345
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,291
給你點上
There you go.

346
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,088
我給你拿點什麼喝的吧
Can I get you a drink or anything?

347
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,924
不  謝了  莫林  有點兒...
No thanks, Maureen. Actually it's...

348
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:08,304
有點兒晚了  我看...
It's getting kind of late. I guess I...

349
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,011
我看我還是回去了吧
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

350
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:16,226
天啊  是呀  你錯過火車了吧
Oh. Gee. That's right. Did you miss your train?

351
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,489
沒關係
That's all right.

352
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,062
我搭下一班
I'll catch the next one.

353
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,396
聽著
Listen,

354
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:23,191
你真的一級棒
You were swell.

355
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:32,200
再會
Take care now.

356
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:07,162
弗蘭克...
Frank...

357
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,612
幹嗎打扮得這麼隆重
Why are you all dressed up?

358
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,100
首先
First of all,

359
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:12,393
我想念你一整天了
I missed you all day

360
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,117
而且  我要道歉
And I wanna say I'm sorry.

361
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:17,912
從演那齣愚蠢的戲劇以來
I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play.

362
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:20,415
這些日子  都是我不好
I'm sorry for everything.

363
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,666
我愛你
And I love you.

364
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:25,754
其它的以後再說
The rest can wait

365
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:26,980
現在  你...
Now, you...

366
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:31,676
在這兒等我叫你再進來  好嗎
Just wait here till I call you. Okay?

367
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:33,261
好
Okay.

368
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,160
好啦  弗蘭克
Alright Frank!

369
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:45,565
你能進來啦
You can come in now!

370
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:06,461
祝你生日快樂
"Happy Birthday to you."

371
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:10,924
親愛的爸爸生日快樂
"Happy Birthday dear Daddy."

372
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:14,928
祝你生日快樂
"Happy Birthday to you."

373
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,307
生日快樂  親愛的
Happy Birthday, Darling.

374
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,043
我愛你  爸爸
I love you, Daddy.

375
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,352
我也是
I love you too.

376
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:40,245
弗蘭克
Frank.

377
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:47,968
弗蘭克
Frank.

378
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:51,131
我有了個絕妙的主意
I have had the most wonderful idea.

379
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,534
我都想一整天了
I've been thinking about it all day.

380
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:56,094
是什麼呀  寶貝
Baby, what's all this about?

381
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,221
你知道我們已經攢了多少錢嗎
You know how much money we have saved...?

382
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:01,516
多到不用你賺一分錢我們就能生活半年
Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime.

383
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:04,769
如果賣了房子車子  時間還能更長
And with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that.

384
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:06,729
賣房...
What we get for the house...

385
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,921
親愛的  你這是什麼意思
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?

386
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:10,316
我們住哪兒去啊
Where are we going to live?

387
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:12,819
巴黎
Paris.

388
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:14,946
什麼
What?

389
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,584
你總說那是唯一一處
You always said it was the only place

390
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,051
讓你流連忘返的地方
You'd ever been, that you wanna to go back to.

391
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,952
唯一一處值得生活的地方
The only place that was worth living.

392
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:22,620
我們為什麼不去呢
So why don't we go there?

393
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,462
你說真的?
You're serious?

394
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:25,146
是啊
Yes.

395
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:27,000
有什麼能阻止我們
What's stopping us?

396
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,531
有什麼能阻止我們
What's stopping us?

397
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:31,004
我能想到好多
Well, I can think of a number of different things.

398
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:34,841
例如  我要找什麼工作
For example, what kind of a job could I possibly get?

399
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:38,170
你不用找任何工作
You won't be getting any kind of job,

400
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,387
我來
Because I will.

401
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:41,306
好  好
Oh, right. Right.

402
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,679
不許笑話我
Don't laugh at me.

403
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,766
聽我說完
Listen a minute.

404
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,336
你知道在歐洲
Do you know what they pay

405
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,806
政府機關秘書的薪水嗎
For secretarial positions in the government agencies in Europe?

406
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:48,855
不知道
No. I don't.

407
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:49,540
聽著  弗蘭克
Listen Frank,

408
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,502
我是認真的
I'm serious about this.

409
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,025
-你覺得我在開玩笑嗎
-Do you think I'm kidding or something?

410
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:52,674
-好吧
-Okay.

411
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,652
我只是有幾個問題
I just have a couple of questions, is all.

412
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:57,447
我想知道  你外出工作賺錢
For one thing, what exactly am I supposed to be doing

413
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:59,824
那我幹嗎呢
While you're out earning all this money?

414
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,480
你看不出來嗎
Don't you see,

415
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,786
這才是關鍵
That's the whole idea?

416
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,540
你就做7年前沒做成的事
You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago.

417
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,375
你有足夠的時間了
You'll have time.

418
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,669
你有生以來第一次有時間
For the first time in your life you'll have time to find out

419
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:14,005
去弄明白你到底想要幹什麼
What it is that you actually want to do.

420
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,507
而當你弄明白之後
And when you figure it out,

421
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:19,052
你有足夠的時間和自由重新開始
You'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.

422
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:25,517
親愛的  這根本不切實際
Sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all.

423
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:33,775
不  弗蘭克  現在的生活才不切實際
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

424
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:36,733
一個有著聰明頭腦的男人
It's unrealistic for a man with

425
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,446
年復一年地做著他根本無法忍受的工作
A fine mind to go on working

426
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:41,199
居住在自己根本不喜歡的地方
Year after year at a job he can't stand,

427
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:43,076
而且他的妻子也跟他一樣
Coming home to a place he can't stand,

428
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,247
那才叫不切實際
To a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.

429
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:50,625
想要聽最糟的那部分嗎
Do you want to know the worst part?

430
00:28:51,627 --> 00:28:55,088
在一切事物上我們都高人一等
Our whole existence here is based on this great premise

431
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:59,425
那是我們在這兒生活的最大前提
That we're special and superior to the whole thing.

432
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,302
但我們並沒有
But we're not.

433
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,013
我們跟其他人一樣
We're just like everyone else.

434
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:07,976
看看我們自己  我們都在自欺欺人
Look at us. We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion.

435
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,270
這個想法使你不得不放棄去追求生活
This idea that you have to resign from life

436
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:13,314
並因為孩子而安定生活
And settle down the moment you have children.

437
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,235
我們因為它而互相折磨
And we've been punishing each other for it.

438
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,363
聽著  我們決定離開這裡
Listen, we decided to move out here.

439
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,407
沒人逼我去諾克斯工作
No one forced me to take the job at Knox.

440
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:25,285
誰說我想做番大事業來著
I mean, whoever said I was meant to be a big deal, anyway?

441
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,592
當我第一次遇見你的時候
When I first met you,

442
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:29,539
這個世界上沒什麼你不能做的
There was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.

443
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:31,457
當你第一次遇見我的時候  我是個自作聰明
When you first met me I was a little wise guy

444
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,584
大嘴巴小伙子  僅此而已
With a big mouth, that's all.

445
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,712
不是  你怎麼可以如此貶低自己
You were not. How can you even say that?

446
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,843
好  好  我有大把時間
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.

447
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:45,555
天曉得那太吸引人了  太吸引人了
And god knows that's appealing. It's very appealing.

448
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,932
你所說的一切都很在理
And everything you're saying makes sense

449
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,456
如果我確實有才華
If I had a definite talent,

450
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,102
如果我是位作家或是位藝術家
If I were a writer or an artist.

451
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:53,813
不  但是  弗蘭克  聽著  聽我說
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.

452
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,733
你的才華都被掩埋了
It's what you are that's being stifled.

453
00:29:56,817 --> 00:30:01,237
被這樣的生活拒之門外了
It's what you are that's being denied and denied in this kind of life.

454
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,366
那是什麼
And what's that?

455
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:09,829
你不知道嗎
Don't you know?

456
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:16,044
你是這個世界上最美妙絕倫的人
You're the most beautiful and wonderful thing in the world.

457
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,674
你是個大丈夫
You're a man.

458
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:46,324
機不可失  失不再來  弗蘭克
This is our chance, Frank. This is our one chance.

459
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:53,289
好
Okay.

460
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:58,419
你答應了?
Okay?

461
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,217
還有什麼可拒絕的呢
Why not? Why the hell not?

462
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:30,493
-大家早安  -早啊  弗蘭克
-Good morning, all. -Morning, Frank.

463
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:32,787
弗蘭克林  很高興見到你春風滿面的
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.

464
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:37,792
-有什麼好事嗎  -夥計們  我要移居巴黎了
-What's the news? -Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

465
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,422
是嗎  我也要移居丹吉爾了
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

466
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,734
發往托萊多的公司內部電函
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

467
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:07,488
注意  給分公司經理  B.F.查默斯
Attention B.F. Chalmers, branch manager.

468
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:12,285
關於最近反覆地函件往來
With regard to recent and repeated correspondence,

469
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,079
這次發函通知問題
This is to advise that the matter has been

470
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:18,332
將會圓滿解決  句號
Very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.

471
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,273
另起一行
Paragraph.

472
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:23,713
我們完全同意現有的公司簡介並不合適
We wholly agree that the existing brochure is unsuitable.

473
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,341
到最後  我們已改進  引用一句話
To this end, we have developed, quote,

474
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:36,017
"談及生產調度"
"Speaking of production control."

475
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,031
給  惠勒太太  這些是您要的旅行支票
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are the traveller's cheques you requested.

476
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,658
-好的  -您預定的船票
-Yes. -Your steamer reservations.

477
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:56,662
我會幫您把這些遞交給大使館
These I'll pass on to the embassy for you.

478
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:58,623
-祝您好運  -謝謝
-Good luck. -Thank you.

479
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,838
9月份走  最遲10月份
September. October at the outside.

480
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,467
我開始想像人們隨心所欲地
I just happen to think people are better off

481
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,094
做著自己確實喜歡的工作
Doing some kind of work they actually like.

482
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,181
-是啊  是啊  -絕對是...
-Right. Right, yes. -Absolutely, absolutely.

483
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:20,770
但是  如果這兒有份真正適合你的工作在等著你
But, I mean, assuming there is this true vocation waiting for you,

484
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:24,982
你不會在這兒發掘嗎
Wouldn't you be just as likely to discover it here as there?

485
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,320
我不認為在諾克斯大廈15層
I don't think it's possible to discover anything

486
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:32,782
能發掘什麼東西
On the 15th floor of the Knox building,

487
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:35,535
你們也一樣
And I don't think any of you do either.

488
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:36,721
爸爸  爸爸  爸爸
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

489
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:41,142
-邁克爾  -爸爸  你會給我們講故事嗎...
-Michael. -Daddy, will you read us...

490
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:46,772
...直奔這兒
...all the way to here.

491
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,818
我們得搭乘一艘大船穿越海洋抵達那兒
We have to take a big boat ride across the sea to get there.

492
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:55,364
-但那兒我一個人都不認識  -我知道  我也是啊
-But I won't know anybody there. -I know. I know. Neither will I.

493
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,409
但你剛上學的時候不也一樣嗎
But remember how you felt when you started school?

494
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,120
看看現在你有那麼多朋友了
And now look how many friends you have.

495
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:04,874
你們絕對猜不到巴黎人都吃什麼
You'll never guess what they eat in Paris.

496
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,251
-你們絕對猜不到  -吃什麼
-You'll never guess. -What?

497
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,421
-吃黏黏的蝸牛  -蝸牛?
-Slimy Snails. -Snails?

498
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,507
黏黏的蝸牛和青蛙腿
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.

499
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:28,856
米莉  你在哪兒  寶貝
Milly, where are you, doll?

500
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,735
快點換衣服  他們馬上就到了
You better get changed, they'll be here soon.

501
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:36,906
-你就穿這身衣服嗎  -你不喜歡嗎
-Is that what you're wearing? -Don't you like it?

502
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:40,785
不  不  你看起來漂亮極了  寶貝
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.

503
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,246
我得快點去換好衣服
Guess I better haul ass.

504
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:02,306
小伙子們  你們好啊
Hiya, gang.

505
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,313
你們在看什麼呢
What you watching?

506
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:49,937
謝普?
Shep?

507
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,775
我到處找你呢
I was calling you and calling you.

508
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,622
來啦  小點心來啦
Here we go. Just a little something.

509
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:16,005
-看起來美味極了  餓死了  -愛寶  我可猜不透
-Those look great. I'm starving. -April, I can't get over it,

510
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:19,675
你看起來像吃了金絲雀的貓
You look like the cat that ate the canary.

511
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:24,138
有什麼事要宣佈嗎  有什麼小道消息嗎
Do you have something to tell us? just a little bit of news?

512
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:28,476
米莉  其實  我們...我們確實有些重要的事要宣佈
Well, actually, Milly, we...Well, we do have some important news, yes.

513
00:37:28,602 --> 00:37:29,935
我就知道
I knew it.

514
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:33,397
親愛的  你來宣佈吧  講吧
Honey, why don't you tell them? Go ahead.

515
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,652
我們要去歐洲了  去巴黎
We're going to Europe. To Paris.

516
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:44,825
去定居
To live.

517
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:50,790
-什麼  -什麼時候
-What? -When?

518
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:54,335
-9月份走  -為什麼
-In september. -But what for?

519
00:37:55,879 --> 00:38:00,466
為什麼  因為我們一直都嚮往去那兒
What for? Well, because we've always wanted to.

520
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,427
因為孩子還小  因為那兒漂亮
Because the kids are young enough. Because it's beautiful.

521
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:06,806
我是說真的  謝普  你去過那兒  你跟她講講吧
I mean, really. Shep, you've been there, you tell her.

522
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,183
-對  是個不錯的城市  -對
-Yeah, it's a great city. -Yeah.

523
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:18,901
你們什麼時候做的決定
When did you make this decision?

524
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:23,155
大概一週前吧  記不清楚了
About a week ago? It's hard to remember.

525
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,282
我們突然決定的  僅此而已
We just suddenly decided to go, that's all.

526
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,571
大概一週前決定的  你們現在才說
About a week ago, you tell us now.

527
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,537
我們得深思熟慮過後才告訴你們
We had to get used to the idea.

528
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,623
那都安排好了嗎  弗蘭克  在那兒找工作還是怎樣
So, what's the deal, Frank? You get a job over there, or what?

529
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:36,836
-不  還不大確定  -不大確定?
-No, no. Not exactly. -What do you mean, "not exactly"?

530
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:42,883
弗蘭克不會找任何工作  因為我會去工作
Frank won't be getting any kind of a job, because I will.

531
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,430
那你打算做什麼呢  弗蘭克
So what are you going to do,Frank?

532
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:51,767
我要去進修  去讀書
I'm going to study. And I'm going to read.

533
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,542
我想我終於要弄清在接下來的人生中我想要做什麼了
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out what I want to do with my life,

534
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:56,814
謝普
Shep.

535
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:58,816
那她支持你嗎
While she supports you?

536
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:02,194
當然  她很支持我
Yes. While she supports me.

537
00:39:03,405 --> 00:39:05,072
一開始就支持我
In the beginning.

538
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,159
那邊的政府機構付給秘書的薪酬
You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work

539
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:10,161
令人難以置信
In those government agencies over there.

540
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:12,913
像北約和非洲經濟委員會那些機構
NATO and ECA and those places.

541
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,708
而且那邊的生活費用超低的  對吧
And the cost of living is dirt cheap, right?

542
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:17,334
超低
It's so cheap.

543
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:22,214
其實我們只是需要換換環境罷了
The truth is we just need something different.

544
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:26,010
歲月催人老  我們不想生命白白流逝
We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by.

545
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:27,595
是啊
That's right.

546
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:31,307
聽起來棒極了  年輕人
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

547
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:35,436
我說真的  聽起來真的很棒
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

548
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,688
-謝謝  米莉  -米莉
-Thank you, Milly. -Oh, Milly.

549
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:41,317
我們一定會想你們的  對吧  親愛的  天哪
We'll certainly miss you both. Won't we, sweetie? Golly.

550
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,110
-當然  -我們也會想你們的
-Sure. -We'll miss you, too.

551
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,236
-一定會  -一定
-Of course. -True.

552
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,405
我們應該為去巴黎乾一杯
We should have a toast or something. To Paris.

553
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:47,740
-為巴黎乾杯  -為巴黎乾杯
-To Paris. -To Paris.

554
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:49,074
為巴黎乾杯
To paris.

555
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,244
-乾杯  -乾杯
-Cheers. -Cheers.

556
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:07,593
你知道我在想什麼嗎
You know what I think?

557
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,470
什麼
What?

558
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:13,098
我認為這整個計劃聽起來有點不成熟
I think this whole plan sounds a little immature.

559
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,893
天哪  我放心多了
Oh, god, I am so relieved.

560
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,898
我也是  我也一直那麼想
Me, too. I was thinking that the whole time.

561
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,524
我的意思是  什麼樣的男人會整天坐在家裡
I mean, what kind of man is going to sit around

562
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,401
游手好閒  無所事事
In his bathrobe all day picking his nose

563
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,055
-而老婆卻在外面賺錢養家呢
-While his wife goes out and works?

564
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:26,946
-不知道
-I don't know, Shep.

565
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,739
我也不知道
I just don't know.

566
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,039
你幹嗎哭啊
Why are you crying?

567
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,126
怎麼了
What's the matter?

568
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:48,968
沒什麼  我只是要發洩一下罷了
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

569
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:52,096
謝普
Shep.

570
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:58,602
求你別哭了  沒事的  一切都會過去的
Don't cry. Please. It's all right. Everything's going to be all right.

571
00:41:01,022 --> 00:41:06,110
我的天哪  瞧他們當時的臉  天哪
My god, their faces! Oh, god.

572
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:08,779
天哪
Oh, god!

573
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:12,491
愛寶  坦白講  你知道這像什麼嗎
You know what this is like, April, honestly?

574
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,535
這麼講吧
Just talking like this?

575
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:18,372
去歐洲的這個想法
The whole idea of going off to Europe this way?

576
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,501
在戰亂之中  這是我第一次感到要去實現夢想
This is the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war.

577
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:25,462
曾經  我大概跟別人一樣也會被嚇到
I mean, I was probably just as scared as everyone else,

578
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:28,966
但內心我從未感到如此舒暢
But inside I never felt better.

579
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,053
我感到自己還活著  熱血沸騰  我感到...
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...

580
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:36,598
一切都...一切看起來都更真實了
Everything just... everything seemed more real.

581
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:38,392
大伙穿著制服
The guys in their uniforms.

582
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:41,136
樹上  田園上  還有我們身上的皚皚白雪
The snow on the fields,the trees, and all of us.

583
00:41:41,137 --> 00:41:43,188
我們這些行人
All of us just walking.

584
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,984
當然  我曾被嚇到了
I mean, I was scared, of course.

585
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:52,031
但我一直在想像  "就是它  這才是真理"
But I just kept thinking, "This is it, you know. This is the truth."

586
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,162
曾經我也那麼覺得
I felt that way once, too.

587
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:00,748
什麼時候
When?

588
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,550
你第一次像我示愛的時候
The first time you made love to me.

589
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,597
愛寶
April.

590
00:42:55,345 --> 00:42:56,512
弗蘭克
Frank.

591
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:25,999
-怎麼了  -巴特·波洛克來了
-What's up? -Bart Pollock's here.

592
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,168
在邦迪的辦公室
He's in Bandy's office.

593
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:31,672
大事不妙啊
Big deal, huh?

594
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:39,555
看起來像是要找你談話
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

595
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:45,102
喂  別提我的大名啊
Hey, keep my name out of it.

596
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,320
很高興見到你  弗蘭克  認識巴特·波洛克吧
Frank. Good to see you. You know Bart Pollock?

597
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:59,533
-從未見過面  但當然...  -很高興認識你  弗蘭克
-Well, we've never met, but of course... -Good to know you, Frank.

598
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:02,286
"談及生產調度"
"Speaking of production control"?

599
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:10,252
弗蘭克  這真是驚世之作啊
Frank, this is a crackerjack.

600
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:15,215
托萊多的人滿意極了
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

601
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:23,891
真的嗎
Really?

602
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,147
波洛克這傢伙是品味極差人物的絕佳代表素材
So, this guy Pollock was perfect presidential material in the worst sense.

603
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:34,610
笑得臉部肌肉都快抽筋了
A million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between the ears.

604
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:36,820
愛寶  你真該聽聽這傢伙說的話
April, you should have heard this guy.

605
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:41,492
"弗蘭克  這真是驚世之作啊"  馬屁都快拍到馬腿上了
"Frank, this is a crackerjack." What a horse's ass.

606
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:45,329
真想看看當你告訴他要辭職時  他的臉色啊
Wish I'd seen his face when you told him you were leaving.

607
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:55,839
他們來了
Here they come.

608
00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:01,220
-抱歉來晚了  -沒事
-Sorry to be late. -You're not late.

609
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:03,931
-交通大擁堵  -謝謝  何必那麼客氣呢
-The traffic was terrible. -Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

610
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,308
-很高興見到你們  -很糟糕吧  霍華德
-Good to see you. -Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

611
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:07,518
第12大道
Well, Route 12.

612
00:45:07,602 --> 00:45:09,436
到他們擴路完畢為止
By the time they finish that stretch of road,

613
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:12,481
他們不得不再重新開始  對吧
They'll have to start all over again, right?

614
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:16,985
-你一定是約翰吧  -約翰  打個招呼
-And you must be John? -Say hello, John.

615
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:20,614
很高興見到你  久仰大名
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

616
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,369
-寶貝孩子們在哪兒呢  -他們去參加生日派對了
-Where are your darling children? -They're at a birthday party.

617
00:45:25,453 --> 00:45:27,704
-抱歉他們沒法在場  -不要緊
-Sorry they couldn't be here. -Don't worry.

618
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:30,123
如果有個精神病患者來我家
If I had a certified lunatic coming around my house,

619
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,709
我大概也會把孩子們支走
I'd probably get the kids out of the way, too.

620
00:45:32,794 --> 00:45:37,130
瞧你們還弄了吃的  真是太客氣了
Look at all this food. You didn't have to go to any trouble for us.

621
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:38,715
只是些三明治而已
It's just some sandwiches.

622
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,218
約翰  要吃三明治嗎
John, would you like a sandwich?

623
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,097
幾個月來海倫一直談到你們
Helen's been talking it up about you people for months.

624
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:47,933
在革命路上年輕友善的惠勒夫婦
The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road,

625
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:51,645
在惠勒路上年輕友善的革命者們
The nice young revolutionaries on Wheeler Road.

626
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:56,358
-你們誰要喝雪利酒嗎  -弗蘭克  別麻煩了
-Would anyone like some sherry? -Please don't bother, Frank.

627
00:45:56,442 --> 00:45:57,734
我要點兒
I'd like some sherry.

628
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:01,446
如果海倫不打我的話  她的那杯也給我
And I'll drink Helen's, too, if she doesn't beat me to it.

629
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:05,867
但是  你有加冰威士忌嗎
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?

630
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:09,997
放兩三塊小方冰進去  斟滿
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim.

631
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:14,042
-我喜歡這樣喝酒  -我想我能辦到
-That's the way I like it. -I think I can handle that.

632
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:23,468
愛寶  這個雞蛋沙拉很好吃  你一定要教我怎麼做
This egg salad is delicious, April. You must tell me how you fix it.

633
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:26,597
-弗蘭克  你是律師?  -不  不  不是
-You a lawyer, Frank? -No. No, I'm not.

634
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:28,015
我曾經可能是個律師
I could use a lawyer.

635
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,809
約翰  別又開始講律師的事了
John, let's not get started again about the lawyer.

636
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:31,935
老爸  你能不能就坐那兒
Pop, couldn't you just sit there

637
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,397
吃你那美味雞蛋沙拉  少摻和
And eat your wonderful egg salad and quit horning in?

638
00:46:36,316 --> 00:46:38,859
我有很多問題要問呢
See, I've got a good many questions to ask

639
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:41,069
我願意為答案付出代價
And I'm willing to pay for the answers.

640
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:44,406
現在  我無需被告知一個男人拿著茶几
Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother

641
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:48,484
追逐他母親  會使自己處於法律的劣勢方
With a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally,

642
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:49,369
那太明顯了
That's obvious.

643
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:52,122
約翰  過來看看窗外的美妙風景
John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window.

644
00:46:52,206 --> 00:46:53,712
如果他用茶几打她並殺她
If he hits her with it and kills her,

645
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:54,625
那就是一起刑事案
That's a criminal case.

646
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:56,145
快看  太陽出來了
Oh, look, the sun's coming out!

647
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,919
如果他只是打碎茶几
If all he does is break the coffee table

648
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:59,880
還有衝她發火
And give her a certain amount of aggravation

649
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:02,966
她決定訴諸法庭  那就是民事訴訟案
And she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case.

650
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:05,636
也許我們會看到彩虹  約翰  快來看呀
Maybe we'll have a rainbow. John, come have a look.

651
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,805
媽  幫幫忙  閉上你的嘴巴
Ma, how about doing everybody a favour? How about shutting up!

652
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:11,016
冷靜點
Settle down, now.

653
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:15,854
也許我可以調查一下  推薦個人  你意下如何
Maybe I can look into it, recommend someone. What do you say?

654
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:26,573
弗蘭克  你做什麼的
So, what do you do, Frank?

655
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:30,869
其實我是在諾克斯商業機械公司上班
I work at Knox Business Machines, actually.

656
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:32,663
設計機械嗎
You design the machines?

657
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:35,916
-不是  -製造  銷售  還是修理?
-Nope. -Make them, sell them, repair them?

658
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,960
-那麼多問題  -算是銷售人員吧
-All these questions. -I help sell them, I guess.

659
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:43,965
我在辦公室做事  其實  那是...
I work in the office. Actually, it's...

660
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,592
有點無趣的工作  真的
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

661
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:48,595
對它根本一點興趣都沒有
There's nothing interesting about it at all.

662
00:47:49,806 --> 00:47:52,224
那為什麼還要做呢
What do you do it for then?

663
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:54,142
也許弗蘭克不喜歡被質問
Maybe Frank doesn't like being questioned.

664
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:57,312
好  好...我知道那不關我的事
Okay, okay, okay. I know it's none of my business.

665
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:59,773
而且  我知道答案
And besides, I know the answer.

666
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:03,026
你要養家餬口  所以必須工作
You want to play house, you got to have a job.

667
00:48:03,111 --> 00:48:06,613
你想要住很漂亮的房子  很溫馨的房子
You want to play very nice house, very sweet house,

668
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:09,074
然後你就得接受一份你不喜歡的工作
Then you've got to have a job you don't like.

669
00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:11,535
無論誰過來說"你為什麼工作"
Anyone comes along and says, "what do you do it for?"

670
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:16,623
他就可能是從州立瘋人院請了4小時假出來的
He's probably on a four-hour pass from the state funny farm.

671
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,503
-都贊同嗎  媽?  -抱歉  弗蘭克
-All agreed? Ma? -Sorry, Frank.

672
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:26,967
沒事  約翰  說實在的  你剛說的我都贊同
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John, I agree with everything you just said.

673
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,722
我們都贊同  所以秋天我要離職了  我們要走了
We both do. That's why I'm quitting the job in the fall. We're taking off.

674
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:33,640
移居巴黎
We're moving to Paris.

675
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:39,479
老媽  你知道這事嗎
Did you know about this, Ma?

676
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:45,819
你什麼感覺  年輕友善的惠勒一家...
How do you feel about that, Ma? The nice young Wheelers...

677
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:54,494
年輕友善的惠勒一家要走了
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

678
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:03,962
-約翰  求你了  -別激動  孩子
-John, please. -Steady down, son.

679
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:13,346
約翰  出去呼吸下新鮮空氣怎麼樣
John. John. How about some fresh air? What do you say?

680
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:15,223
如果你同意的話?
If that's all right with you?

681
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:17,143
我不知道這樣行不行...
I don't know if it's such a good idea...

682
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:18,894
如果約翰想去的話  我覺得沒什麼大礙
If John wants to, I don't see the harm.

683
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,396
-好  -你先請
-Good. -After you.

684
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:31,573
-聽說你是位數學家  -你聽錯了  一切都已成過去時
-I hear you're a mathematician. -You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

685
00:49:32,492 --> 00:49:33,617
過去時?
All gone?

686
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:36,620
你知道電擊療法嗎
You know what electrical shock treatments are?

687
00:49:36,704 --> 00:49:38,413
知道  知道
Yes. Yes, I do.

688
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:40,165
我已經做過37次了
I've had 37.

689
00:49:43,878 --> 00:49:46,755
本該擊掉情感問題
Supposed to jolt out the emotional problems.

690
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:51,343
-卻只擊掉了數學  -真糟糕
-Just jolted out the mathematics. -How awful.

691
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:57,098
"真糟糕"?  為什麼  因為數學很有意思嗎
"How awful"? Why, because mathematics is so interesting?

692
00:49:57,892 --> 00:50:00,894
不是  因為電擊肯定很糟糕
No. Because the shocks must be awful and,

693
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:05,315
糟糕是因為它並沒達到你想要的結果
Because it's awful not to be able to do what it is that you want to do.

694
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:07,943
我想數學肯定很枯燥乏味
I think mathematics must be dull.

695
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:11,613
我喜歡你太太  弗蘭克
I like your girl, Frank.

696
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:13,031
我也是
Me, too.

697
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:16,701
那像你們這樣的夫婦還有什麼可逃避的呢
So, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from?

698
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:19,204
-我們不是在逃避  -那為什麼要去巴黎
-We're not running. -So what's in Paris?

699
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:22,415
-不同的生活方式  -也許我們是在逃避
-A different way of life. -Maybe we are running.

700
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:27,337
我們在逃避這兒絕望空虛的生活  對吧
We're running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here, right?

701
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,339
絕望空虛?
The hopeless emptiness?

702
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:37,889
你說到點上了  很多人都活在空虛裡
Now you've said it. Plenty of people are on to the emptiness,

703
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:42,978
但直面絕望真的很需要勇氣
But it takes real guts to see the hopelessness.

704
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,626
他好像是第一個能真正了解
You know, he's the first person

705
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:09,629
我們在談論什麼的人
Who seemed to know what we were talking about.

706
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:15,635
是真的  不是嗎  也許我們跟他同類
Yeah. That's true, isn't it? Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

707
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:21,224
如果瘋狂跟生活息息相關的話
If being crazy means living life as if it matters,

708
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:24,311
那麼我不在乎我們是否完全瘋了
Then I don't care if we are completely insane.

709
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:28,231
你在乎嗎
Do you?

710
00:51:31,193 --> 00:51:32,193
不在乎
No.

711
00:51:34,614 --> 00:51:36,364
我好愛你
I love you so much.

712
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:51,004
告訴你一些事  弗蘭克  那個特德·邦迪  友善的傢伙
Tell you something, Frank. That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

713
00:51:51,213 --> 00:51:52,589
討喜的傢伙
Real sport.

714
00:51:52,673 --> 00:51:54,424
足以勝任部門經理一職
Good enough department head and all.

715
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:56,593
但對於這些年他把你的才華隱沒
But I'm a little sore at him for the way he's kept you

716
00:51:56,677 --> 00:51:58,762
我真是感到痛心疾首啊
Under a bushel all these years.

717
00:51:58,846 --> 00:52:02,432
-這地方還好吧  -很好  先生  很好
-This place okay for you? -It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

718
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:05,852
有一件事讓我很感興趣  弗蘭克  就這一件事而已
One thing interests me, Frank, and one thing only.

719
00:52:05,937 --> 00:52:09,689
賣電腦給美國商人
Selling the electronic computer to the American businessman.

720
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:14,361
那是我組建一個團隊的原因  聚集像你這樣的人才
That's why I'm assembling a team. Men like you.

721
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:16,738
不再是以前普通的售貨員了
Not your average salesmen.

722
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:18,114
這意味著有更豐厚的薪水
It'll mean more money,

723
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:21,826
而且  說實話  也許需要付出更多的時間
And, I got to be honest, maybe more of a time commitment.

724
00:52:21,953 --> 00:52:23,333
但你會成為那些
But you'll be a part

725
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:25,372
激動人心的事業的一員  惠勒
Of something exciting, Wheeler.

726
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:26,790
電腦
Computers.

727
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:33,213
先生  這聽起來挺有趣
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

728
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:35,048
-叫我巴特  -巴特
-Bart. -Bart.

729
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:42,555
巴特  問你一個問題
Bart, let me ask you a question.

730
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:46,893
你有沒有想到一位叫厄爾·惠勒的人  揚克斯市的
Do you happen to remember an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

731
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:52,565
-恐怕沒有  是你親戚?  -我爸爸
-Can't say that I do. Relation of yours? -My father.

732
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,069
他在諾克斯做了差不多20年的銷售
He worked as a salesman for Knox for almost 20 years.

733
00:52:57,697 --> 00:53:02,158
厄爾·惠勒
Earl Wheeler.

734
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:07,122
你也理由會記住他
There's no reason you'd remember him.

735
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:11,042
我敢肯定他是個好人
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

736
00:53:17,842 --> 00:53:23,221
聽著巴特  有件事我早該和你說
Listen, Bart, there's something I should have mentioned earlier.

737
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:28,226
我打算在秋季離開公司
I'm going to be leaving the firm in the fall.

738
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:33,189
-跳槽嗎  -不  不  不是跳槽
-Another outfit? -No, no, it's not another outfit.

739
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:36,109
聽著  弗蘭克  是薪水的問題嗎
Now, look, Frank. Is it a question of money?

740
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,194
若是薪水問題的話  那就沒有任何理由
Because if it is, there's no reason

741
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:39,362
使我們達不成共識...
We can't get together on a satisfactory...

742
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:42,699
我非常感激  但不是錢的問題
Well, I sure appreciate that, but no, it's not the money.

743
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:47,787
那是...那是私事
It's... well, it's more of a personal thing.

744
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:50,123
我希望你能理解
I hope you understand.

745
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,125
私事?
A personal thing?

746
00:53:53,002 --> 00:53:54,210
我明白
I see.

747
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:58,757
弗蘭克  我父親告訴我
Frank, let me tell you something my father told me.

748
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,052
人生只有幾次機會
A man only gets a couple of chances in life.

749
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,387
如果你不及時把握
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,

750
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:06,264
不久後便會呆呆坐著
It won't be long before he's sitting around wondering

751
00:54:06,348 --> 00:54:08,683
後悔當時有機會卻沒把握住
How he got to be second rate.

752
00:54:14,648 --> 00:54:16,149
我想也是
I guess so.

753
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:19,986
所以  拜託  別猶豫了
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.

754
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,823
和你妻子商量一下
Discuss it with your wife.

755
00:54:25,117 --> 00:54:26,743
因為  說實話  妻子總是
Because let's be honest, where the hell would any of us be

756
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:28,870
伴隨我們左右的
Without our wives, anyway?

757
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:36,086
而且  弗蘭克  坦率地說  如果你加入我們
And, Frank, in all sincerity, if you do decide to join us,

758
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:39,339
我相信你將永遠不會後悔
I believe it'll be a thing you'll never regret.

759
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:42,967
我還相信另一件事
And I believe something else, too.

760
00:54:43,302 --> 00:54:46,429
我相信這會是對你父親很好的紀念
I believe it'd be a fine memorial to your Dad.

761
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:51,935
想想吧  弗蘭克  仔細想想
Think about it, Frank. Really think about it.

762
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:01,194
知道你擁有的一切  逗號
Knowing what you've got, comma,

763
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,032
知道你所求  逗號
Knowing what you need, comma,

764
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:11,621
知道完成某些事可以不用  破折號
Knowing what you can do without, dash.

765
00:55:13,499 --> 00:55:15,542
存貨控制
That's inventory control.

766
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:36,229
知道你擁有的一切  逗號
Knowing what you've got, comma,

767
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:40,692
知道你所求  逗號
Knowing what you need, comma,

768
00:55:42,611 --> 00:55:46,406
知道完成某些事可以不用  破折號
Knowing what you can do without, dash.

769
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:50,243
存貨控制
That's inventory control.

770
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:53,580
你好  弗蘭克
Hi, Frank.

771
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:56,916
在加班?
Working late?

772
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:01,254
是啊  我快好了
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.

773
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:06,009
聽說你要升職了
I heard you were getting promoted.

774
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:08,720
機會難得
Big shot.

775
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:15,560
我想你父親肯定為你感到驕傲
I guess your Dad would have been real proud, huh?

776
00:56:23,611 --> 00:56:25,486
是啊  我想也是
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

777
00:56:34,997 --> 00:56:38,374
那也許我該請你喝點東西
So maybe I should take you for a drink or something?

778
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:42,462
就當慶祝一下
You know, celebrate.

779
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:48,593
好  可以吧
Yeah, maybe.

780
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,141
我去拿東西
I'll just get my things.

781
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:04,734
我要帶上我的玩具馬車
I'm going to bring my doll carriage

782
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:07,737
還有我的3只復活節兔子  還有我的長頸鹿
And my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe

783
00:57:07,821 --> 00:57:10,907
還有我所有的玩偶  玩具房  蠟筆...
And all my dolls and my doll house and my crayons...

784
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,742
也許我們可以把玩具房送給艾德林
I thought maybe we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

785
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:14,869
我不想送給艾德林
I don't want to give the doll house to Madeline.

786
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:16,162
但我早和你說清楚了
But I already explained to you,

787
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:17,872
大的東西很難塞進行李
The big things are going to be hard to pack.

788
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:19,374
但我可以給她娃娃熊
But she can have my bear,

789
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:22,919
-還有那3只復活節的兔子  -不行  就那大的東西
-And my three easter rabbits. -No! Just the big things.

790
00:57:23,003 --> 00:57:25,088
聽著  為什麼不出去和邁克爾玩兒
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside and play with Michael?

791
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,674
-我不想去  -你一整天都在房子裡
-I don't feel like it. -You've been inside all day.

792
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:28,967
我不想出去
I don't feel like it.

793
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:32,220
我不喜歡向無聊且愚蠢得無法理解的人
Well, I don't feel like explaining everything 15 times

794
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:35,431
把每一件事情都解釋15遍
To somebody who's too bored and silly to listen!

795
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:45,024
-好了  愛寶  你怎麼了  -沒事
-All right, April. What's the matter? -Nothing.

796
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:47,860
我不信  早上發生什麼事了
I don't believe you. Did something happen this morning?

797
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:51,364
很久以來都沒發生什麼了
Nothing happened today that I haven't known about for days and days.

798
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:52,532
什麼
What?

799
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,119
天啊  弗蘭克  別再裝傻了
Oh, god, Frank, please don't look so dense.

800
00:57:56,203 --> 00:57:57,954
你就從沒懷疑過?
You mean you haven't guessed or anything?

801
00:57:58,038 --> 00:58:00,456
愛寶  你到底在說什麼
April, what are you talking about?

802
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:05,712
我懷孕了  就這樣
I'm pregnant, that's all.

803
00:58:08,507 --> 00:58:09,549
什麼
What?

804
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:11,968
弗蘭克  我本想等孩子們睡了再告訴你的
Frank, I meant to wait till the kids were in bed to tell you,

805
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:14,971
但我只是...整個星期我都確信
But I just... well, I've been pretty sure all week

806
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,389
今天我去看了醫生
And today I went to the doctor,

807
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:19,309
現在我根本無法假裝沒事發生
And now I can't even pretend it's not true.

808
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:22,812
-多久了  -10個星期
-How long? -Ten weeks.

809
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:29,652
10個星期  10個星期?  你現在才告訴我?
Ten weeks. Ten weeks? And you wait until now to tell me?

810
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:33,394
我以為...我也不知道我怎麼想的
I thought... I don't know what I thought

811
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:35,575
對不起  弗蘭克  對不起
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

812
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:38,494
我知道  我知道你很難過
I know. I know you are. All right?

813
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,748
我們會有辦法的
There are things we can do.

814
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:44,834
我們不會因此而卻步  對吧
We don't have to let this stop us from going, do we?

815
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:47,170
記得我告訴你那個學校裡的女孩子嗎
Remember that girl at school I told you about?

816
00:58:47,254 --> 00:58:49,185
只要我們在12個星期前
As long as we take care of it

817
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:50,923
把它處理掉就沒事了
Before 12 weeks, it's fine.

818
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:54,844
我們必須同心協力  弗蘭克
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

819
00:58:57,139 --> 00:59:01,851
我們會有辦法的  對嗎
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?

820
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,605
過來
Come here.

821
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:11,944
12個星期  那我們還有時間來做決定
Twelve weeks. So we have time to decide, right?

822
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:13,613
對
Right.

823
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:17,367
我愛你
I love you.

824
00:59:21,538 --> 00:59:23,206
我也愛你
I love you, too.

825
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:11,462
弗蘭克  工作怎樣了  公司沒你也能運作?
So, Frank, how's work? They gonna survive without you?

826
01:00:13,632 --> 01:00:16,759
事實上  前幾天發生了件很搞笑的事
Actually, something kind of funny happened the other day.

827
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:19,656
我只是做了點無聊的事
I did some dumb little piece of work

828
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,431
想要逃離邦迪的束縛
To get myself off the hook with Bandy,

829
01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:24,350
突然  我就變成一個前途光明的有位青年了
And suddenly, I'm the bright young man.

830
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:28,104
-事情總是這樣  不是嗎  -難以置信
-That's always the way, ain't it? -It's incredible.

831
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,189
我是說  我只是用幾分鐘時間搞定那東西
I mean, I knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes

832
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:34,193
現在他們想我加入他們的精英銷售員隊伍
And now they want me to join their team of "specialist" salesmen.

833
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:35,862
一群白癡
Morons.

834
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:39,824
那會很有趣  如果他們
Well, it would be funny if they weren't offering

835
01:00:39,908 --> 01:00:41,701
給我不菲的薪水
So much damn money.

836
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:48,124
那麼  你被誘惑住了嗎
So, are you tempted?

837
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:51,878
真有點諷刺  不是嗎
Well, it's just kind of ironic, don't you think?

838
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:18,070
我以為你已經拒絕了這份工作
I thought you turned the job down.

839
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:20,615
還沒有
Not yet.

840
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:24,118
這只是給我一個選擇  就這樣
It's just an option, that's all.

841
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,723
有了這麼多的錢
With the kind of money they're talking,

842
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,206
我們的生活就會有很大改觀了
Things could be different for us here.

843
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,958
我們可以去更好的地方  去旅行
We could get a better place. Travel.

844
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:33,773
我是說在這兒我們也可以很開心
The point is, we could be happy here,

845
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,171
起碼會有一陣子
At least for a little while.

846
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:37,507
不可能只有巴黎人
It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones

847
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:40,510
才能追求有趣的生活  愛寶
Capable of leading interesting lives, April.

848
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:42,553
所以你已經作出決定了?
So you've made up your mind?

849
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:46,682
不  不  就像我之前說的  那只是一個選擇
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option. That's all.

850
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:52,688
假設你是對的
And supposing you're right.

851
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:56,859
你去掙這些錢  我們在這兒過著有趣的生活
You make all this money and we have this interesting life here.

852
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:59,564
每天掙扎在你覺得荒唐的工作裡
Won't you still be wasting your life

853
01:01:59,565 --> 01:02:02,114
那還不是在浪費你的生命嗎
Toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

854
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:05,243
你就別管我的事了  好嗎
Maybe we let that be my business, all right?

855
01:02:05,327 --> 01:02:06,744
你的事?
Your business?

856
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:10,748
這裡太熱了  我去濕濕身子
You know what? It's too hot for this. I'm going to go get wet.

857
01:02:22,803 --> 01:02:26,222
-你不想去  對不對  -別這樣  愛寶  我當然想去
-You don't want to go, do you? -Come on, April. Of course, I do.

858
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:29,267
不  你不想  因為你從未嘗試過任何事
No, you don't. Because you've never tried at anything.

859
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:32,144
如果你什麼也不嘗試  你永遠會失敗
And if you don't try at anything, you can't fail.

860
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:34,564
你什麼意思  我不嘗試?
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

861
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:37,108
我供養你  是我買下了這房子
I support you, don't I? I pay for this house.

862
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:39,735
我每天花10小時干我無法忍受的工作
I work 10 hours a day at a job I can't stand.

863
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,071
-你沒必要去做  -狗屁
-You don't have to. -Bullshit!

864
01:02:42,322 --> 01:02:43,531
聽著  我對此也很不爽
Look, I'm not happy about it.

865
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:46,576
但我有骨氣  不會逃避責任
But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities.

866
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,912
用你的骨氣去追求你想要的生活  弗蘭克
It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.

867
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:55,585
你要去哪兒
Where are you going?

868
01:02:55,669 --> 01:03:00,006
我要用浴室  這不會影響你吧  愛寶
If it's all right with you, April, I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?

869
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:31,120
你他媽要用這個幹什麼
What the hell are you going to do with this?

870
01:03:31,204 --> 01:03:32,705
你到底在想什麼
And what do you think you're going to do?

871
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:34,457
-你要阻止我嗎  -我就是要阻止你
-You're going to stop me? -You're damn right I am!

872
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:35,708
來啊
Go ahead and try.

873
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:39,503
聽著  如果你真的做了  愛寶  我發誓我...
Listen to me. You do this, April, you do this and I swear to god I'll...

874
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:41,922
你怎樣  離開我嗎  是威脅還是承諾?
You'll what? you'll leave me? Is that a threat or a promise?

875
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:43,132
你什麼時候買的  愛寶
When did you buy this, April?

876
01:03:43,216 --> 01:03:44,800
這東西你買了多久  我要知道
How long have you had this? I want to know!

877
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:45,843
天啊
Jesus christ.

878
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:48,929
整件事你真的很荒謬
You really are being melodramatic about this whole thing.

879
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:52,642
只要在第12週前完成  就完全沒事
As long as it's done in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.

880
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,846
那就是現在  愛寶  我就沒有發言權嗎
That's now, April! Don't I get a say?

881
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:55,853
當然有
Of course you do!

882
01:03:55,937 --> 01:03:58,189
我都是為了你  弗蘭克  你難道看不見嗎
It would be for you, Frank. Don't you see?

883
01:03:58,273 --> 01:04:00,232
那樣我們就有時間  就像我們之前說的
So you can have time, just like we talked about.

884
01:04:00,317 --> 01:04:01,692
你的想法快使我吐了
How can it be for me when the thought of it

885
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:03,778
怎麼會是為我好呢  天啊
Makes my stomach turn over, for God's sake?

886
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:05,279
那就是我自私好了
Then it's for me.

887
01:04:05,364 --> 01:04:07,239
告訴我  我們能在巴黎要孩子  弗蘭克
Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank.

888
01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:09,486
告訴我  我們會有不同的生活
Tell me we can have a different life.

889
01:04:09,487 --> 01:04:11,535
就是別讓我待在這兒  拜託了
But don't make me stay here. Please.

890
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,914
-我們不能在巴黎要孩子  -為什麼
-We can't have the baby in Paris. -Why not?

891
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:18,042
我不需要我們擁有的一切  我不在乎住哪兒
I don't need everything we have here. I don't care where we live.

892
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:20,753
是誰定下這些規矩的?
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

893
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:26,801
聽著  我們搬來這兒的唯一原因是我懷孕了
Look, the only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant.

894
01:04:26,885 --> 01:04:27,886
然後我們又生了一個
Then we had another child

895
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:29,428
來證明前面一個不是錯誤
To prove the first one wasn't a mistake.

896
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:31,847
這一切究竟還要持續多久
I mean, how long does it go on?

897
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:36,769
弗蘭克  你真的想再要一個孩子嗎
Frank. Do you actually want another child?

898
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,233
想嗎  快點  告訴我
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

899
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:46,153
告訴我  弗蘭克  記得嗎
Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that?

900
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:48,572
我們以前就是這樣挽回面子的
We used to live by it.

901
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:51,075
你知道這真相有多好嗎
And you know what's so good about the truth?

902
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:55,079
其實每個人都知道
Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it.

903
01:04:55,163 --> 01:04:59,291
沒人忘記這真相  弗蘭克  他們只是更擅長說謊
No one forgets the truth, Frank. They just get better at lying.

904
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:06,006
所以告訴我  你真的想再要一個孩子嗎
So tell me, do you really want another child?

905
01:05:07,884 --> 01:05:10,010
我只知道我的感覺
All I know is what I feel.

906
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:16,851
任何頭腦清醒的人都和我有相同的感受  愛寶
And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way, April.

907
01:05:16,935 --> 01:05:21,230
但我們已經有兩個小孩了  這還不夠讓我說話嗎
But I've had two children. Doesn't that count in my favour?

908
01:05:21,356 --> 01:05:24,275
天啊  愛寶  你竟然這樣想
Christ, April! The fact that you even put it that way!

909
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:25,939
你弄得好像
You make it seem as if having

910
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,362
有小孩就是一種懲罰
Children is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

911
01:05:28,488 --> 01:05:30,531
我愛我的孩子  弗蘭克
I love my children, Frank.

912
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:34,869
你確信?
And you're sure about that, huh?

913
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,580
你到底是什麼意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

914
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:41,333
愛寶  你剛說我們的女兒是個錯誤
April, you just said our daughter was a mistake.

915
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:43,753
天知道你是否想過要打掉她
How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her,

916
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,463
-或打掉邁克爾  -不
-Or michael for that matter? -No.

917
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:49,324
天知道你是否想把我們整個家衝進馬桶
How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet

918
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:51,510
不  那不是真的  我當然沒有
no, that's not true. Of course I didn't.

919
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:53,596
我怎麼知道  愛寶
But how do I know, April?

920
01:05:53,722 --> 01:05:56,807
停  不要說了  弗蘭克
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

921
01:05:57,309 --> 01:06:01,687
愛寶  一個普通的女人  一位正常的母親
April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother

922
01:06:01,772 --> 01:06:05,107
絕不會去買橡膠管來給自己墮胎
Doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion

923
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:08,486
那樣她就能生活在自己的幻想中
So she can live out some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

924
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,168
聽著  整件事你都極不理智
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing.

925
01:06:25,837 --> 01:06:27,797
我想是時候找個人
And I think it's about time we found somebody

926
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:30,216
來給你理順生活了
To help make some sense of your life.

927
01:06:31,468 --> 01:06:34,470
用那份工作的薪水來支付這費用?
And the new job's going to pay for that, too?

928
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:41,477
愛寶  如果你需要心理醫生
April, if you need a shrink,

929
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:43,938
很明顯
Obviously.

930
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:52,446
好了  我想我們沒話說了
Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say then, is there?

931
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:05,125
所以去巴黎是個很幼稚的想法  對吧
So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh?

932
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:13,008
也許吧
I guess maybe it was.

933
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:30,359
愛寶  在這兒我們也能很開心
April, we can be happy here.

934
01:07:31,653 --> 01:07:33,696
我能使你快樂
I can make you happy here.

935
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:38,200
我們已經在這兒住那麼久了  沒必要離開
We've had a great couple of months. It doesn't need to end.

936
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:44,832
我們會好起來的  我保證
We're going to be okay. I promise.

937
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:50,754
希望如此  弗蘭克
I hope so, Frank.

938
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:54,216
我真的希望如此
I really hope so.

939
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:38,135
久等了  波洛克先生現在可以見你了
Thank you for waiting. Mr Pollock will see you now.

940
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:41,680
非常感謝
Thanks so much.

941
01:08:52,442 --> 01:08:54,818
被失敗的避孕打擊啊
Foiled by faulty contraception.

942
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:58,197
不得不說  我很遺憾
I can't say that I'm sorry.

943
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:01,992
你只是在那間舊房間迷失了  我可以告訴你
You'd have been sorely missed in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.

944
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:04,828
你不也一樣嗎
Wouldn't have been the same without you.

945
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:08,040
而且...
Besides... well...

946
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:11,752
什麼
What?

947
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:18,217
那計劃似乎很不現實  不是嗎
The plan always seemed a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

948
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:24,306
我想這不關我的事
I suppose it's none of my business, really.

949
01:09:24,391 --> 01:09:27,726
當然  這不關你的事
No. No. I suppose it isn't.

950
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:38,946
他們將在秘書室裡慶祝
They'll be celebrating in the secretarial pool.

951
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:11,186
記得你第一次帶我們來這裡嗎
Hey! Remember the first time you brought us here?

952
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,438
當然
Absolutely.

953
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:16,692
你說  維托小木屋的酒品味獨特
You said it takes a special kind of taste to enjoy vito's log cabin.

954
01:10:16,818 --> 01:10:19,570
它味道很糟糕  但又覺得好喝
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

955
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:29,288
看看  多開心  我們又聚在一起了
Look at me. I'm just so happy. Our little gang's back together again.

956
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:35,586
大家喜歡那些樂隊和服務生嗎? 他們今晚是不是很棒?
How do you like the boys in the band? Aren't they swinging tonight?

957
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:45,763
-歐洲也不怎樣  -沒錯
-Hey, Europe's not going anywhere. -That's right.

958
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:11,288
愛寶  親愛的  來跳支舞
April, honey, how about a dance?

959
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,335
現在不想  遲會兒吧
Not right now. Maybe later.

960
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:19,004
-我跳  -好
-I'll dance. -Okay.

961
01:11:33,853 --> 01:11:36,980
我想她還為巴黎感到沮喪  對吧
Guess she's still pretty blue about Paris, huh?

962
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:38,941
你認為她會好起來嗎
Think she'll be okay?

963
01:11:39,025 --> 01:11:41,152
當然  給我們這些女孩幾天時間
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days

964
01:11:41,153 --> 01:11:42,820
一切就會好起來的
And we can get over anything.

965
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:44,113
對
Right.

966
01:11:45,865 --> 01:11:56,792
弗蘭克
Frank.

967
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:59,711
你還好吧  米莉
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?

968
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:01,880
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

969
01:12:02,966 --> 01:12:04,341
失陪一下
Excuse me.

970
01:12:09,264 --> 01:12:10,931
太好了
That's just great.

971
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:14,643
我們該怎樣離開呢
How the hell are we supposed to get out now?

972
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:16,270
天啊
Oh, boy.

973
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:20,691
別擔心  謝普  我們可以等一會兒
Don't worry about it, Shep. We can wait. Really.

974
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,359
那保姆該怎麼辦
What about the sitter?

975
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:24,433
聽著  要不你送米莉回家
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,

976
01:12:24,434 --> 01:12:25,529
然後你自己回去
Then go home yourself.

977
01:12:25,613 --> 01:12:27,093
這樣就能顧及兩邊的保姆了
That takes care of both sitters.

978
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:28,574
然後謝普可以遲點送我回去
Then Shep can take me home later.

979
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:31,326
-這樣不錯  -那好吧
-Yeah, it's fine by me. -Okay, then.

980
01:12:32,662 --> 01:12:36,248
-你...可以嗎  -當然
-You... You'll be all right? -Sure.

981
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,167
好吧
Okay.

982
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:41,628
-晚安  -晚安
-Good night. -Good night.

983
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:43,630
希望你能好點
Feel better.

984
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,361
很抱歉你去不了那兒了
I'm sorry you're not going away any more.

985
01:13:07,488 --> 01:13:09,865
我知道這對你很重要
I know it was important to you.

986
01:13:11,117 --> 01:13:15,579
請別誤會  我去過那裡
Don't take this wrong, but I've been there.

987
01:13:16,414 --> 01:13:19,291
他們有的我們都有
They don't have so much we don't have here.

988
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:22,044
不一定要去巴黎的
It didn't have to be Paris.

989
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:27,132
你只是想離開這裡  是嗎
You just wanted out, huh?

990
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:29,134
我想融入這裡
I wanted in.

991
01:13:32,555 --> 01:13:36,225
我只是想讓我們再來一次
I just wanted us to live again.

992
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,900
多少年來  我以為只有我們知道這秘密
For years, I thought we shared this secret.

993
01:13:47,987 --> 01:13:50,781
以為我們會活得很精彩
That we would be wonderful in the world.

994
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:56,995
但我又不知道具體該怎樣  只是...
I didn't exactly know how, but just...

995
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:01,124
只是那可能性讓我充滿希望
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

996
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:10,175
多可憐
How pathetic is that?

997
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,553
多愚蠢
So stupid.

998
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:21,061
把你所有的希望都寄托於不可能兌現的承諾裡
To put all your hopes in a promise that was never made?

999
01:14:25,066 --> 01:14:28,026
弗蘭克知道  他知道他要什麼
See, Frank knows. He knows what he wants.

1000
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,946
他找到了落腳處
He's found his place. He's just fine.

1001
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:34,074
結了婚  有兩個小孩
Married, two kids.

1002
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:40,998
已經足夠了
It should be enough.

1003
01:14:46,337 --> 01:14:47,838
滿足了
It is for him.

1004
01:14:52,552 --> 01:14:54,052
他是對的
And he's right.

1005
01:14:56,681 --> 01:15:00,309
我們並不特別  什麼都不是
We were never special or destined or anything at all.

1006
01:15:00,852 --> 01:15:02,561
不  你們很特別
Yes, you are.

1007
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,397
你...
You're...

1008
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:08,859
你們是惠勒一家
You're the Wheelers.

1009
01:15:08,985 --> 01:15:11,945
你們是很般配的夫妻  所有人都這樣說
You're a terrific couple. Everybody says so.

1010
01:15:13,281 --> 01:15:15,532
我看到另一個未來
I saw a whole other future.

1011
01:15:19,078 --> 01:15:20,996
我無法放棄
I can't stop seeing it.

1012
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:27,627
不能離開
Can't leave,

1013
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:31,298
不能留下
Can't stay.

1014
01:15:33,634 --> 01:15:35,510
對別人毫無用處
No damn use to anyone.

1015
01:15:43,603 --> 01:15:44,853
別這樣
Come on.

1016
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:47,814
跳舞吧
Let's do it.

1017
01:16:57,552 --> 01:16:58,760
我們去哪兒
Let me take you somewhere.

1018
01:16:58,845 --> 01:17:02,222
不  就在這兒  快
No. Just do it here. Now.

1019
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:50,353
愛寶
April.

1020
01:17:53,065 --> 01:17:55,400
這是我一直所嚮往的
This is what I've always wanted.

1021
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,195
我愛你
I love you.

1022
01:17:59,197 --> 01:18:00,739
別說了
Don't say that.

1023
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:05,952
不  我說真的  我愛你
No. I mean it, I love you.

1024
01:18:06,078 --> 01:18:09,915
安靜一會兒吧
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

1025
01:18:14,378 --> 01:18:16,505
然後載我回家
Then you can take me home.

1026
01:19:07,473 --> 01:19:09,182
外面天氣不錯
It's beautiful out.

1027
01:19:10,434 --> 01:19:11,851
是啊
Yes, it is.

1028
01:19:16,816 --> 01:19:18,733
知道今天是什麼日子嗎
You know what today is?

1029
01:19:19,277 --> 01:19:21,778
-第12週了  -是啊
-It's 12 weeks. -That's right.

1030
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:29,286
這個夏天過得有點不太現實
Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer.

1031
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,413
我們倆都太緊張了
We've both been under a strain.

1032
01:19:31,497 --> 01:19:34,249
我是說  我理解你為什麼煩躁
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

1033
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:38,753
你想知道為什麼我不和你睡一張床了
You know I'm not sleeping with you, and you want to know why.

1034
01:19:40,172 --> 01:19:45,010
對不起  弗蘭克  但我不想談這件事
Well, I'm sorry, Frank, but I really don't feel like talking about it.

1035
01:19:45,678 --> 01:19:48,680
好吧  那我們談什麼  愛寶
All right. Then what should we talk about, April?

1036
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:52,183
就不能什麼都不談嗎
Would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything?

1037
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:55,895
我們能不能安安靜靜的過日子
I mean, can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can,

1038
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:59,608
而不是老要談那些破事
And not feel like we have to talk about everything all the time?

1039
01:19:59,692 --> 01:20:03,069
我沒要建議談那些破事
I don't think I'm suggesting that we talk about everything all the time.

1040
01:20:03,154 --> 01:20:07,365
我是說  我們之前都太緊張了
Look, my point is we've both been under a strain

1041
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:11,703
我們應該互相幫對方一把  別再越陷越深了
And we ought to be helping each other out as much as we can right now.

1042
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:15,749
天知道為什麼我最近表現那麼不正常
I mean, god knows my own behaviour has been pretty weird lately.

1043
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:22,464
實際上  我有件事要告訴你
As a matter of fact, there is something I'd like to tell you about.

1044
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,761
我在城裡的時候  和一個女人有過幾次...
I've been with a girl a few times, in the city.

1045
01:20:29,555 --> 01:20:31,848
我和她都不太熟
A girl I hardly even know.

1046
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,976
她對我來說什麼都不是
It was nothing to me,

1047
01:20:35,061 --> 01:20:39,064
現在結束了  徹底結束了
But it's over now, really over.

1048
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:41,446
我要是沒結束
And if I weren't sure of that,

1049
01:20:41,447 --> 01:20:43,693
就永遠沒法告訴你
I guess I could never have told you about it.

1050
01:20:49,033 --> 01:20:50,492
為什麼
Why did you?

1051
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:53,078
寶貝  我不知道
Baby, I don't know.

1052
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:56,164
自從墮胎那件事之後
I think it's a simple case of wanting to be a man again

1053
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:57,957
我只是想找些新鮮的感覺
After all that abortion business.

1054
01:20:58,042 --> 01:21:01,753
我有點不理智  總想去證明些什麼
Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.

1055
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:05,131
不是  我不是問你為什麼告訴我外面有女人
No. I don't mean why did you have the girl.

1056
01:21:05,216 --> 01:21:08,009
我是問你為什麼告訴我
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

1057
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:13,598
-你什麼意思  -你告訴我這些幹什麼
-What do you mean? -I mean, what's the point?

1058
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:19,020
是想讓我吃醋嗎
Is it supposed to make me jealous or something?

1059
01:21:19,105 --> 01:21:20,939
還是想讓我愛上你
Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you,

1060
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:23,817
還是想讓我和你上睡  還是怎麼的
Or back into bed with you, or what?

1061
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:27,570
你想讓我說什麼  弗蘭克
I mean, what would you like me to say, Frank?

1062
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,950
說說你的感受  愛寶
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

1063
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:34,953
我沒感覺
I don't feel anything.

1064
01:21:35,621 --> 01:21:39,708
也就是說  你不在乎我做了什麼  我幹了誰是嗎
In other words, you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything?

1065
01:21:43,379 --> 01:21:46,673
對  我想是的  我不在乎
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

1066
01:21:49,093 --> 01:21:50,802
愛干誰幹誰吧
Fuck who you like.

1067
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:54,347
愛寶  你不明白我想讓你在乎嗎
April, don't you understand that I want you to care?

1068
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,641
我知道  我知道你想
I know. I know you do.

1069
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,019
我如果還愛你的話我就會在乎了
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

1070
01:22:00,104 --> 01:22:03,231
不過我不愛你了  我剛剛才發現
But I don't think I do any more. And I only just figured that out.

1071
01:22:03,315 --> 01:22:06,776
所以我寧願現在什麼都不談
And that's why I'd just as soon not do any talking right now.

1072
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:09,320
少跟我說這些狗屁  少這麼跟我說話
Don't give me that shit, April. Don't give me that.

1073
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,031
-你很清楚你愛我  -你這麼覺得嗎
-You know goddamn well you love me. -You think so?

1074
01:22:12,116 --> 01:22:13,992
你知道的
You know goddamn well!

1075
01:22:15,995 --> 01:22:17,495
有人在家嗎
Anyone home?

1076
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:25,044
不好意思  晚餐有些遲了  再喝點什麼嗎
I'm sorry dinner's late. Would anyone like another drink?

1077
01:22:25,129 --> 01:22:28,882
別費心了  坐下聊聊天挺好的
Don't worry. It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.

1078
01:22:29,175 --> 01:22:30,800
不用麻煩了
You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

1079
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:32,594
你還要收拾東西呢
With all your packing and whatnot.

1080
01:22:32,678 --> 01:22:36,473
我猜你肯定有的忙了  沒別的意思
I imagine you have a lot on your plate. No pun intended.

1081
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,185
事實上  有點小變動
Actually, there's been a change of plans.

1082
01:22:41,103 --> 01:22:43,438
很顯然啊
I thought maybe it was obvious.

1083
01:22:43,522 --> 01:22:44,814
愛寶懷孕了
April here is pregnant.

1084
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:48,026
-恭喜啊  -愛寶
-Congratulations. -oh, April!

1085
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,279
我真替你高興
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

1086
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:53,990
我猜你們得需要個大點兒的房子了  是吧
But I expect you'll be needing a bigger house now, won't you?

1087
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:56,910
等等  老媽  等等
Hold it a second, Ma. Hold on a second, Ma.

1088
01:22:56,994 --> 01:23:00,955
我沒明白  為什麼很顯然
I don't get this. I mean, what's so obvious about it?

1089
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,877
我是說  她懷孕了又怎樣  歐洲人不生孩子嗎
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what? Don't people have babies in Europe?

1090
01:23:05,961 --> 01:23:07,629
-約翰...  -這麼說吧
-John... -Suppose we just say

1091
01:23:07,713 --> 01:23:10,632
哪個地方的人都是這樣  除非能養得起
That people anywhere aren't very well advised to have babies

1092
01:23:10,716 --> 01:23:12,842
否則他們不會考慮要孩子的
Unless they can afford them.

1093
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:18,181
好吧  好吧  是錢的問題  錢是個好借口
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money. Money's a good reason.

1094
01:23:18,265 --> 01:23:22,644
但是一般都不是真正的原因
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

1095
01:23:22,728 --> 01:23:27,941
真正的原因是什麼  老婆不想去了嗎
What's the real reason? Wife talk you out of it or what?

1096
01:23:28,484 --> 01:23:32,445
小女人覺得她還沒準備好離開"過家家"的生活
Little woman decide she isn't quite ready to quit playing house?

1097
01:23:33,531 --> 01:23:35,907
不是這個原因  我能看出來
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.

1098
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:39,118
她看起來夠強硬
She looks too tough and adequate as hell.

1099
01:23:41,038 --> 01:23:45,708
那就是你了  你怎麼了
Okay, then. It must've been you. What happened?

1100
01:23:45,793 --> 01:23:50,421
-約翰  別這樣  你太無禮了  -不  不  怎麼了  弗蘭克
-John, please. You're being very rude. -No, no. What happened, Frank?

1101
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,136
臨陣畏縮了嗎
You get cold feet?

1102
01:23:57,221 --> 01:24:00,473
你還是覺得在這兒好  是嗎
You decide you're better off here after all?

1103
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:05,395
你發現留在這個
You figure it's more comfy

1104
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:09,983
腐朽無望的空虛裡更舒服是嗎
Here in the old hopeless emptiness after all, huh?

1105
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:14,904
就是這麼回事  看他這張臉
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.

1106
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:17,282
怎麼了啊  惠勒  我愈加激昂了嗎
What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?

1107
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:20,785
-行了  小子  我覺得我們應該...  -你知道嗎
-All right, son. I think we'd better be... -You know something?

1108
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,788
如果他故意讓她中招  我不會感到驚訝的
I wouldn't be surprised if he knocked her up on purpose

1109
01:24:23,873 --> 01:24:25,562
這樣他後半生就可以
Just so he could spend the rest of

1110
01:24:25,563 --> 01:24:27,542
藏在她的孕婦裝後面了
His life hiding behind a maternity dress.

1111
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:30,879
這樣他就永遠不用去尋找真正的自己了
That way he'd never have to find out what he's really made of.

1112
01:24:30,963 --> 01:24:34,632
你給我聽著  我對你已經仁至義盡了
Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you.

1113
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:37,510
你他媽以為你是誰
I mean, who the hell do you think you are?

1114
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:39,012
你來到我家  還說了那麼多
You come in here and say

1115
01:24:39,096 --> 01:24:42,140
你腦中那些瘋話
Whatever crazy goddamn thing comes into your head,

1116
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:43,786
我覺得是時候該有人站出來
And I think it's about time somebody

1117
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,518
告訴你應該閉嘴了
Told you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.

1118
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:48,646
-他有病  弗蘭克  -有病個屁
-He's not well, Frank. -Not well, my ass!

1119
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:52,609
我才不在乎他是否有病  是死是活
I don't give a damn if he's sick or well or dead or alive,

1120
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:54,360
他應該閉上他那張爛嘴
He should keep his fucking opinions

1121
01:24:54,445 --> 01:24:57,989
回到那個他應該待的瘋人院去
In the fucking insane asylum where they belong!

1122
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:03,369
-走吧  孩子  -走吧  約翰
-Let's go, son. -Come on, John.

1123
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:10,543
你男人可真是個大人物  愛寶
Big man you got there, April.

1124
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,129
厲害的居家男人
Big family man.

1125
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:18,843
我為你感到遺憾
I feel sorry for you.

1126
01:25:21,513 --> 01:25:24,974
還有  你們倆挺配的
Still, maybe you deserve each other.

1127
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:29,486
看你現在這樣子  我也開始為他
I mean, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him,

1128
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:29,729
感到遺憾了
Too.

1129
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:33,650
你肯定也沒讓他有好日子過
You must give him a pretty bad time

1130
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:37,654
要不為什麼讓孩子來證明他有種
If making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

1131
01:25:37,905 --> 01:25:42,492
-你他媽的...  -他是個病人  弗蘭克
-You fucking... -No! He's not well, Frank!

1132
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:57,799
好了  約翰  快走吧
All right, John. Let's get on out to the car now.

1133
01:26:03,597 --> 01:26:06,557
愛寶  太抱歉了  對不起
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1134
01:26:06,642 --> 01:26:11,270
是啊  對不起  對不起
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

1135
01:26:11,355 --> 01:26:14,315
老媽  我說的對不起還不夠多嗎
Ma, have I said "I'm sorry" enough times?

1136
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,693
媽的  我是對不起
Damn! I am sorry, too.

1137
01:26:16,777 --> 01:26:19,737
我打賭我才是那個最該被抱歉的雜種
I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know.

1138
01:26:19,822 --> 01:26:21,198
但是話說回來
But get right down to it,

1139
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,950
我也沒有什麼事可開心的
I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.

1140
01:26:24,034 --> 01:26:25,159
是吧
Do I?

1141
01:26:27,871 --> 01:26:29,831
但是你知道嗎
But, hey, you know what?

1142
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:33,251
我很為一件事開心
I am glad about one thing.

1143
01:26:33,836 --> 01:26:36,129
你知道是什麼嗎
You want to know what I'm glad about?

1144
01:26:38,549 --> 01:26:41,175
我很開心我不是那個孩子
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

1145
01:26:58,777 --> 01:27:02,238
好  好  別告訴我
Okay, okay, don't tell me.

1146
01:27:02,823 --> 01:27:04,949
別告訴我  我猜猜
Don't tell me, let me guess.

1147
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:09,078
我做了一件讓人很反感的事  對吧
I made a disgusting spectacle of myself, right?

1148
01:27:10,831 --> 01:27:11,914
對
Right.

1149
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:13,624
那瘋子說的一切都是對的  是吧
And everything that man said is true, right?

1150
01:27:13,709 --> 01:27:15,501
那就是你想說的話嗎
Is that what you're going to say?

1151
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:17,712
很明顯我不用說了
Apparently I don't have to.

1152
01:27:17,796 --> 01:27:20,798
-你都替我說了  -你錯了  愛寶
-You're saying it for me. -Well, you're wrong, April.

1153
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:24,594
-是嗎  為什麼我錯了  -因為他是瘋子
-Really? Why am I wrong? -Because the man is insane.

1154
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:27,930
他瘋了  你明白精神錯亂是什麼意思嗎
He's fucking insane! Do you know what the definition of insanity is?

1155
01:27:28,015 --> 01:27:29,182
不  你明白嗎
No. Do you?

1156
01:27:29,266 --> 01:27:32,769
我明白  就是沒有能力對另一個人負責
Yes, it's the inability to relate to another human being.

1157
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:34,937
沒有能力去愛
It's the inability to love.

1158
01:27:39,943 --> 01:27:42,653
愛寶  愛寶
April. April.

1159
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:45,990
愛寶  愛寶
April! April!

1160
01:27:46,075 --> 01:27:50,328
沒有能力...沒有能力去愛了
The inability... the inability to love.

1161
01:27:52,164 --> 01:27:55,124
弗蘭克  你可真是個大話家
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1162
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:58,544
如果單憑說話就可以顛倒是非
If black could be made into white by talking,

1163
01:27:58,629 --> 01:28:00,671
你就是最適合這個工作的人
You'd be the man for the job.

1164
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:03,257
現在我瘋了  是因為我不愛你了  對吧
So now I'm crazy because I don't love you. Right?

1165
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:05,426
-你是這個意思吧  -不是
-Is that the point? -No. Wrong.

1166
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:09,472
你瘋了  但你還愛我  這是我的意思  愛寶
You're not crazy and you do love me. That's the point, April.

1167
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:13,184
我不愛你  我恨你
But I don't. I hate you.

1168
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:16,521
你只不過是個在派對上曾逗我笑過的男人
You were just some boy who made me laugh at a party once

1169
01:28:16,605 --> 01:28:19,107
而現在我一見你就噁心
And now I loathe the sight of you.

1170
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:23,236
還有  如果你敢靠近我  如果你敢碰我一下
In fact, if you come any closer, if you touch me or anything,

1171
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,196
我會大叫的
I think I'll scream.

1172
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:28,491
別這樣  愛寶
Come on. Stop this, April.

1173
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:35,998
去你媽的  愛寶
Fuck you, April!

1174
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,502
去你媽的  還有你所有的憎恨  下賤的...
Fuck you and all your hateful, snotty little...

1175
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:42,296
你想幹什麼  想打我嗎
What're you going to do now? Are you going to hit me?

1176
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:45,424
-向我證明你有多愛我?  -別擔心  我都懶得打你
-To show me how much you love me? -Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1177
01:28:45,592 --> 01:28:48,261
你根本都不值得我去打
You're not worth the trouble it would take to hit you.

1178
01:28:48,345 --> 01:28:51,055
你都不值得費那些炸彈炸掉你的那些炮灰
You're not worth the powder it would take to blow you up.

1179
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:55,434
你這個空虛  沒有心腸的女人
You're an empty, empty, hollow shell of a woman!

1180
01:28:56,562 --> 01:29:00,565
你如果這麼恨我  留在我家幹什麼
What the hell are you doing in my house if you hate me so much?

1181
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:03,359
為什麼還和我結婚
Why the hell are you married to me?

1182
01:29:03,443 --> 01:29:06,320
為什麼還懷我的孩子
What the hell are you doing carrying my child?

1183
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:09,115
為什麼你有機會的時候不離開我
I mean, why didn't you just get rid of it when you had the chance?

1184
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,243
因為聽我說  聽我說  我有話要告訴你
Because listen to me. Listen to me, I got news for you.

1185
01:29:12,327 --> 01:29:14,495
我真希望你離開了我
I wish to god that you had.

1186
01:29:48,572 --> 01:30:15,640
愛寶
April!

1187
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:25,691
-愛寶  -離我遠點
-April! -Stay away from me.

1188
01:30:25,817 --> 01:30:26,313
-愛寶
-April,

1189
01:30:26,314 --> 01:30:27,860
聽著  -離我遠點
listen. -Stay away from me.

1190
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:29,862
難道我在這破林子裡都甩不開你嗎
Can't I even get away from you in the fucking woods?

1191
01:30:29,947 --> 01:30:31,948
愛寶  聽著  我不是有心的
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1192
01:30:32,032 --> 01:30:34,408
-真的  我真不是那麼想的  -你能不能閉嘴
-Honestly, I didn't mean what I said. -Are you still talking?

1193
01:30:34,493 --> 01:30:37,328
怎樣才能讓你閉嘴?
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?

1194
01:30:37,955 --> 01:30:41,540
我想靜一靜  你看不出來嗎  我要安靜
I need to think. Can't you see that? I need to think.

1195
01:30:43,961 --> 01:30:45,753
回家吧  你在這幹嗎  愛寶
Please come back to the house. What're you doing out here, April?

1196
01:30:45,837 --> 01:30:47,421
你還想讓我再叫嗎  弗蘭克
Do you want me to scream again, Frank?

1197
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:49,715
我會的  我真的會的
Because I will! I mean it!

1198
01:30:58,392 --> 01:31:00,851
好吧  好
Okay. Okay.

1199
01:34:34,107 --> 01:34:36,063
早
Good morning.

1200
01:34:36,064 --> 01:34:39,195
早
Good morning.

1201
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:43,616
雞蛋要炒的還是煎的
Would you like scrambled eggs or fried?

1202
01:34:48,538 --> 01:34:50,122
不知道
I don't know.

1203
01:34:50,874 --> 01:34:55,961
什麼都行  炒的吧  能簡單點吧
It doesn't really matter. Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1204
01:34:56,713 --> 01:34:59,715
好吧  那我也要炒的
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1205
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:02,027
早餐要是沒有孩子們吵還挺好的  是吧
It's kind of nice having breakfast without the kids for a change, huh?

1206
01:36:02,112 --> 01:36:03,279
是啊
Yes.

1207
01:36:04,197 --> 01:36:07,116
我想你今天會想要好好吃頓早餐
I thought you'd probably want a good breakfast today.

1208
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,452
今天很重要  是吧
I mean, it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it?

1209
01:36:11,288 --> 01:36:14,832
你是要今天和波洛克見面嗎
Isn't this the day you have your conference with Pollock?

1210
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,253
對啊  對
Yes. Yes, that's right.

1211
01:36:21,298 --> 01:36:25,217
-要事啊  -我想也應該很重要
-Big deal. -I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1212
01:36:25,885 --> 01:36:27,636
對他們來說很重要
For them, anyway.

1213
01:36:28,888 --> 01:36:32,558
新的工作要做什麼
What exactly do you think you'll be doing in your new job?

1214
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:35,728
你還沒怎麼跟我說過呢
You haven't really told me much about it.

1215
01:36:36,563 --> 01:36:37,980
沒有嗎
Haven't I?

1216
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:42,359
其實就是諾克斯準備要
Well, I think this whole thing is about Knox getting ready

1217
01:36:42,444 --> 01:36:45,738
買一台大型的計算機
To buy up one of those really big computers,

1218
01:36:45,822 --> 01:36:47,948
比500還大的
Even bigger than the 500.

1219
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:52,328
-我沒跟你說過嗎  -沒有
-Didn't I tell you about that? -No.

1220
01:36:52,996 --> 01:36:55,039
現在說說
Why don't you tell me now?

1221
01:37:01,796 --> 01:37:06,258
基本上  是個很大  很快的算數計算機
You know, basically it's just a big, fast adding machine.

1222
01:37:07,927 --> 01:37:11,639
但是你看不到機械部分
Only, instead of mechanical parts, you see,

1223
01:37:12,349 --> 01:37:17,686
你能看到上千個獨立電子管
You've got thousands of individual vacuum tubes.

1224
01:37:28,531 --> 01:37:29,782
這樣啊
I see.

1225
01:37:37,624 --> 01:37:39,667
至少我覺得我明白了
At least I think I see.

1226
01:37:43,505 --> 01:37:46,590
是挺有意思的
Yes, it's really kind of interesting, isn't it?

1227
01:37:49,177 --> 01:37:51,011
不知道
Well, I don't know.

1228
01:37:53,056 --> 01:37:56,266
某些方面來說  是挺有意思的
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting, in a way.

1229
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:03,607
要珍惜你做的工作  弗蘭克
You should value what you do, Frank.

1230
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:07,027
顯然你很擅長這個
You're obviously good at it.

1231
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:25,671
我該走了
Well, I guess I'd better be getting started, huh?

1232
01:38:32,554 --> 01:38:34,888
我想說  愛寶...
Listen, though, April, the...

1233
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:38,809
這樣多好
This was really nice.

1234
01:38:40,395 --> 01:38:43,480
早餐很好  我...
I mean, it was a swell breakfast. Really, I...

1235
01:38:44,357 --> 01:38:47,693
我不知道是否有過比這更好的早餐
I don't know when I've ever had a nicer breakfast.

1236
01:38:49,946 --> 01:38:53,866
謝謝  我也很開心
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1237
01:39:15,638 --> 01:39:19,767
你不再恨我了嗎
Then you don't... you don't hate me or anything?

1238
01:39:22,395 --> 01:39:26,106
不  當然不恨了
No. No, of course I don't.

1239
01:39:36,868 --> 01:39:38,494
過得愉快
Have a good day.

1240
01:39:45,251 --> 01:39:49,004
好吧  再見
Okay, then. So long.

1241
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:35,777
喂?  米莉  還好嗎
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?

1242
01:41:38,072 --> 01:41:41,056
沒有  我還是不太舒服
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better.

1243
01:41:41,057 --> 01:41:42,701
所以我打個電話
That's really why I called.

1244
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:48,332
如果方便的話  今晚最好了
If it's not an inconvenience for you, this evening would be great.

1245
01:41:49,334 --> 01:41:50,375
什麼
What?

1246
01:41:53,087 --> 01:41:58,091
不  不  他們要是在外面玩的話就不用了
Oh, no. No. Not if they're outdoors playing.

1247
01:42:02,388 --> 01:42:04,431
別把他們叫進來
Don't call them in.

1248
01:42:04,515 --> 01:42:08,936
替我親他們一下
Just give them each a kiss for me,

1249
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:12,439
告訴他們...
And tell them I...

1250
01:42:14,108 --> 01:42:15,609
告訴他們...
Tell them...

1251
01:42:16,903 --> 01:42:22,783
你知道的  好的  謝謝  米莉  再見
You know. All right. All right. Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1252
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:57,372
我需要幫助
I think I need help.

1253
01:45:58,875 --> 01:46:02,836
革命路115號
115 Revolutionary Road.

1254
01:46:29,697 --> 01:46:32,490
-弗蘭克  怎麼回事  -上帝啊
-Frank. They tell you what happened? -Jesus christ.

1255
01:46:32,575 --> 01:46:35,118
謝普  他說的我都沒怎麼聽懂
Shep, I didn't understand half the things he told me.

1256
01:46:35,203 --> 01:46:37,996
他說她到醫院之前孩子已經沒了
He said the foetus was out before they got her here.

1257
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,975
他們得做手術拿出那個  那個什麼
And they had to operate to take out the, what do you call it,

1258
01:46:41,976 --> 01:46:42,792
胎盤嗎
The placenta?

1259
01:46:42,877 --> 01:46:45,212
她現在大出血
And now she's still bleeding.

1260
01:46:45,296 --> 01:46:48,006
他說救護車到之前她就流了很多血
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came,

1261
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:50,508
他們正在努力止血
And now they're trying to stop it.

1262
01:46:50,718 --> 01:46:55,096
他說了一堆我根本聽不懂  什麼毛細血管...
He said a whole lot of things I didn't understand about capillaries...

1263
01:46:55,806 --> 01:47:00,185
他說她還在昏迷中  天啊
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.

1264
01:47:00,269 --> 01:47:02,145
弗蘭克  坐下來吧
Okay, Frank, why don't you just take a seat?

1265
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:04,606
我坐下有什麼用  上帝啊
What the hell do I want to sit down for, for god's sake?

1266
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:08,860
好了  弗蘭克  放輕鬆點  冷靜點
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy. Take it easy.

1267
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,741
-弗蘭克  我這兒有煙  -她故意的  謝普
-Frank, have a cigarette. -She did it to herself, Shep.

1268
01:47:16,702 --> 01:47:18,662
她故意的
She did it to herself.

1269
01:47:26,254 --> 01:47:28,505
我給你拿點咖啡
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1270
01:48:38,826 --> 01:48:42,954
他們是那麼好的人  對吧  謝普
They were such wonderful people. Weren't they, Shep?

1271
01:48:43,789 --> 01:48:48,501
真的很讓人震驚  可憐的愛寶
It's just devastating. Poor April.

1272
01:48:48,586 --> 01:48:49,919
謝謝
Thank you.

1273
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:54,591
弗蘭克現在住在城裡  他在哪兒工作來著
Frank lives in the city now. Where is it that he works?

1274
01:48:55,634 --> 01:48:58,136
-巴特·波洛克聯合公司  -計算機的?
-Bart Pollock Associates. -Computers?

1275
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:01,348
有趣的公司
Interesting firm.

1276
01:49:01,432 --> 01:49:04,726
-之後再見過他嗎  -沒有  沒再回來過
-Have you seen him since? -No. Not back here.

1277
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:09,105
我想可能是這裡有太多回憶了  謝普在城裡見過他
There are too many memories, I think. Shep has seen him in the city.

1278
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:11,107
是嗎  親愛的
Haven't you, sweetie?

1279
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:14,778
弗蘭克把所有精力都投入到孩子身上
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1280
01:49:15,654 --> 01:49:18,740
只要一有時間  就陪他們玩
Every spare moment he has, he spends with them.

1281
01:49:33,923 --> 01:49:35,256
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1282
01:49:46,519 --> 01:49:48,061
怎麼了
You all right?

1283
01:49:53,442 --> 01:49:56,694
我不想再談惠勒家的事了
I don't want to talk about the Wheelers any more.

1284
01:49:58,239 --> 01:49:59,322
好吧
Okay.

1285
01:50:01,617 --> 01:50:04,464
我們不說了
We don't have to.

1286
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:06,996
不說了
We don't have to.

1287
01:50:49,123 --> 01:50:51,875
爸爸  爸爸  看啊  爸爸
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.

1288
01:50:57,882 --> 01:50:59,591
你不知道我有多喜歡
I can't tell you how pleased I am

1289
01:50:59,675 --> 01:51:02,886
革命路的那所小房子  霍華德
About the little revolutionary road place, Howard.

1290
01:51:03,304 --> 01:51:06,264
無論我什麼時候經過  都有一種
And now whenever I drive past, it gives me such a lift

1291
01:51:06,348 --> 01:51:09,976
想再看看那種清新的氣氛  那種潔淨的感覺
To see it all perked up and spanking clean again.

1292
01:51:10,561 --> 01:51:12,979
每戶窗裡都亮著燈
All the lights in all the windows.

1293
01:51:14,064 --> 01:51:14,993
你知道嗎
And do you know?

1294
01:51:14,994 --> 01:51:18,276
我在想  我喜歡那座房子這麼多年
I was just thinking, I've loved that little house for years.

1295
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:22,864
佈雷斯家是我找的唯一真正適合的人家
And the Braces are the only really suitable people I've ever found for it.

1296
01:51:23,449 --> 01:51:26,284
非常好  非常隨和的人家
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1297
01:51:26,368 --> 01:51:29,078
你是說除了惠勒家之外嗎
Well, except for the Wheelers, you mean.

1298
01:51:31,081 --> 01:51:33,500
我曾經非常喜歡惠勒一家
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1299
01:51:34,335 --> 01:51:37,795
我只是感覺他們有點古怪  有點神經質
They were a bit whimsical for my taste. A bit neurotic.

1300
01:51:38,923 --> 01:51:40,256
我從沒說過這個  但是他們總是
I never stressed it, but they were often

1301
01:51:40,341 --> 01:51:43,510
在有些方面上很難相處
Very trying people to deal with, in many ways.

1302
01:51:44,803 --> 01:51:49,599
實際上  那所小房子之所以這麼難賣
And actually, the main reason that the little house was so hard to sell

1303
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:52,852
就是因為他們太不好好愛護這房子了
Was because they let it depreciate so dreadfully.

1304
01:51:52,937 --> 01:51:58,566
變形的窗框  潮濕的地窖  滿牆的蠟筆畫
Warped window frames, wet cellar, crayon marks all over the walls,
