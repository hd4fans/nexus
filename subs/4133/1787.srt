有人祈求获救

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,740
有人祈求速死

6
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,720
但更多人以为诸神已离弃

7
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,360
天地万物落入永恒的黑暗

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,830
凯尔特马族的反叛

12
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,590
总督要重开这些贸易路线
The Governor wants these
trade routes re-opened.

13
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,510
叛乱的凯尔特人必须根除
These rebel Celts need to be
dealt with once and for all.

14
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,400
这旨令要明确传达到各领地
This entire territory
requires a clear 
and well-defined message.

15
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,820
是，科佛斯司令
Yes, Tribune Corvus.

16
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,950
No!

17
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,880
杀掉他们
Kill them.

18
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,720
格杀勿论
Kill them all.

19
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,650
Ah!

17年后

23
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,260
Useless!

24
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,190
你把我从温柔乡拖来看这个？
You've dragged me from a perfectly
adequate brothel for this?

25
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,440
我想不通凯撒为何属意这种狗窝
What Caesar saw in this
hell hole, I'll never know.

26
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,450
养这些色雷斯人不便宜
These Thracians are far
too costly to feed.

27
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,290
他们老是把警卫搞成残废
They're always maiming the guards.

28
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,550
我在寻找新奇事物，贝雷特
I'm looking for something new,
Bellator, something fresh.

29
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,130
才有新鲜感

30
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,130
大家唤他凯尔特
They call him The Celt.

31
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,640
他的族人都是驯马高手
They say his people were horsemen

32
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,390
他是唯一幸存者
and that he is the last of them.

33
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,980
Celt! Celt! Celt!

34
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,080
凯尔特...！

35
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,230
这人留在乡下浪费了吧，主人？
Wasted out here in the provinces,
wouldn't you say, Master?

36
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,840
"不列颠尼亚，伦丁尼姆"

37
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,990
"庞贝城"

38
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,600
让路！快让路！
Make way! Make way!

39
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,940
离开道路，闪开
Off! Off the road! Off!

40
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,310
离开道路
Off the road!

41
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,990
让路给上等人
Make way for your betters!

42
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,910
快走，人渣
Move it, scum!

43
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,710
离开道路
Clear the way there!

44
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,710
快走
Move!

45
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,410
那匹马
The horse.

46
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,040
回去队伍，奴隶
Back in line, slave!

47
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,960
那匹马很痛苦，蠢蛋
The horse is in pain,
you ignorant pig!

48
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,100
住手
Stop!

49
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,890
让他帮那匹马
Let him help the horse.

50
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,730
是，小姐
Yes, My Lady.

51
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,010
放松，放松，乖
Easy. Easy, boy.

52
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,250
压住前腿上方
Put pressure on the
top of the leg here,

53
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,080
这样它断气时才不会痛苦
so he doesn't feel the
pain when I move him.

54
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,170
抱歉，小姐，他是野蛮人
I'm sorry, My Lady. He's a savage.

55
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,710
起来
Get up!

56
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,770
换一匹马
Harness another horse.

57
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,500
为何那个粗人要杀马？
Why would the brute do that?

58
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,800
因为那是最仁慈的做法
Because it was the
kindest thing to do.

59
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,350
走吧
Come.

60
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,610
谢谢
Thank you.

61
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
快走
Go on!

62
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,820
在罗马看那么多男人...
A whole year in Rome and I
never saw you look at any man

63
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,770
你从未有看那奴隶的眼神
the way you looked at that slave.

64
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,050
我不敢相信他的力量
I can't believe he had
the strength to do that.

65
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,380
你没看见他的肌肉吗？
Didn't you see his muscles?

66
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,890
我不是那个意思
That's not what I meant.

67
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,720
真的？
Really?

68
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,220
别逗我了
Oh, please...

69
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,860
你看，就在那里
Look. There it is.

70
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,450
我们到家了
We're home.

71
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,540
庞贝城

72
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,350
维纳丽亚节

73
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,360
车夫，怎么了？
Driver, what is it?

74
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,740
维纳丽亚节，小姐
The Vinalia, My Lady.

75
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,910
封街，到处是醉汉
The streets are blocked.
Drunkards everywhere.

76
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,790
干嘛？
- What?
- Come on.

77
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,710
走吧

78
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,540
小姐？
My Lady?

79
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,630
小姐
My Lady!

80
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,510
回别墅见
We'll meet you back at the villa.

81
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,430
小姐
My Lady!

82
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,130
我记得每座雕像，每个街角
I remember every statue,
every street corner.

83
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,850
会使你想念罗马吗？
Does it make you miss Rome?

84
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,310
会使我忘记那里
It makes me forget it.

85
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,420
凯西雅，真高兴见到你
Cassia, oh, it's so
good to see you.

86
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,300
但你怎么回来了？
But how are you here? We weren't
expecting you until after Vinalia.

87
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,170
我们以为节庆后你才会回来

88
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,640
我受不了在罗马多待一天
I couldn't bear to spend
another day in Rome.

89
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,600
太多自大男巴着我奉承
Too many arrogant men who
flatter you with their presence.

90
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,320
听起来我的宝贝长大了
It sounds like my baby
is no longer a child.

91
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,830
爸，你在哭吗？
- Father, are you crying?
- Shh.

92
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,130
别说出去，否则我做生意会被坑
Tell no one.
Or I'll never haggle a
decent price again.

93
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,510
我们好想你
We missed you.

94
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,650
不得了，这全是你的行李？
Juno's tit! Is this
all your luggage?

95
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,740
你是买下整座罗马城吗？
What have you done, purchase
the entire city of Rome?

96
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,700
有遇到心上人吗？
Did you meet anyone there?

97
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,370
回到庞贝城没人值得一提
Nobody worth talking
about in Pompeii.

98
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,460
别担心
Well, not to worry.

99
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,490
你爸以昭告全市的单身汉你回来了
I think your father has informed
every unmarried man in
the city of your return.

100
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,010
不会吧，真的？
Oh, no. Really?

101
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,890
快来，我要听罗马的每件事
Now, come on. I want to
hear everything about Rome.

102
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
我好想你
I've missed you.

103
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,780
欢迎到你们的新家，野蛮人
Welcome to your new home, savages.

104
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,730
继续走
Keep walking!

105
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,480
站住
Stop!

106
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,030
解开他们
Unlock them.

107
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,750
喂这些畜牲
Feed these animals.

108
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,930
小飞
Vires!

109
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,810
我好想你
Oh, I missed you.

110
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,070
我好想你，你好
I missed you. Hello.

111
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,490
它很高兴见到你，小姐
He's pleased to see you, My Lady.

112
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,620
我看得出它受到良好照顾
And I can see he's
been in good hands.

113
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,790
谢谢你，菲力
Thank you, Felix.

114
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,960
明天一早我会把小飞准备好给您
And I'll have Vires ready for
you first thing tomorrow.

115
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,630
今晚我会亲自训练他
I'll exercise him myself tonight.

116
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

117
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,220
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

118
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,960
阿提卡斯
Atticus...

119
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,050
那应该是凯尔特
I think that's The Celt.

120
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,760
哪个凯尔特？
Which Celt?

121
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,010
独一无二的凯尔特
The Celt.

122
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,140
听说他比你还快
They say that Celt is
faster even than you.

123
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
听说不足为据
They always say that.

124
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,860
他要你报上名字，凯尔特
He wants to know your name, Celt.

125
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,740
报上名字，你杀了他兄弟
He wants the name of the
man who killed his brother.

126
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,710
他要我报上名字？
He wants to know my name?

127
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,960
两杯酒押色雷斯大汉
Two wine rations on
the big Thracian.

128
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,900
两杯酒，成交
Two wine rations. Done.

129
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,920
给我解释
Explain.

130
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,890
不是他起头的，他正在用餐
He did not start it.
He was trying to eat.

131
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,640
贝雷特
Bellator!

132
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,320
你得职责是看好这些人，不是吗？
Your purpose is to care
for these men, is it not?

133
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,050
要是没人付钱观赏
别平白让他们自相残杀
Having them bite pieces
from one another
is of no value if no one
is paying to see it.

134
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,050
抱歉，葛雷克斯主人
I'm sorry, Master Graecus.

135
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,180
那个没用了
That one is done.

136
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,690
这个还有救
This one...
Can be repaired.

137
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,950
再有下次，你要付出代价
And the next time, Bellator,
it will be at your cost.

138
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,480
我会记住你，凯尔特
I'll remember you, Celt.

139
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,230
开门
Open the gate!

140
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,660
关上
Close it!

141
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,100
你欠我两杯酒，凯尔特
You owe me two wine rations, Celt.

142
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,720
渴了，好
Thirsty? Okay.

143
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,020
怎么了？
What's wrong?

144
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,100
小飞！
Vires!

145
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,230
小飞！
Vires!

146
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,000
醒来，人渣
Wake up, scum.

147
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,180
站起来
On your feet.

148
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,160
别紧张
Relax.

149
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,830
要是我想杀你
If I was going to kill you, Celt...

150
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,220
我早就下手了
I would have done it already.

151
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,520
你叫什么名字？
What is your name?

152
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,710
我们迟早要交谈的
We will have to speak
at some point.

153
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,750
没必要
No, we don't.

154
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,760
我们只是迟早要杀掉对方
What we have to do is kill
each other at some point.

155
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,930
所以别管我的名字
So my name's my own, I have
no interest in learning yours.

156
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
我也没兴趣打听你的名字

157
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,880
所有人出来
Everyone out!

158
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,550
快走
Move!

159
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,800
你老了，阿提卡斯
You're getting old, Atticus.

160
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,970
许多新血等不及要取代冠军
Plenty of young flesh out here just
aching to take apart a champion.

161
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,730
明天我在竞技场再获胜
When I win in the arena
tomorrow, I'm a free man.

162
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,900
我就自由了

163
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,570
罗马法律
It's Roman law.

164
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,870
你无可奈何
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

165
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,170
阿提卡斯，我的冠军
Atticus, my champion,

166
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,600
明天你有幸终结比赛
tomorrow you have the honor
of closing the games.

167
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,640
但首先
First,

168
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,110
我来替你找个旗鼓相当的对手
let us see if I have
found an opponent
worthy of you.

169
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:39,160
哪个可怜虫该为我的自由而死？
Now...
Who's the poor bastard who
has to die for my freedom?

170
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,030
很不幸，凯尔特
Unlucky, Celt.

171
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,460
太不幸了
Very unlucky.

172
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,260
但我不会出手太重
But I'm going to
take it easy on you.

173
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,850
给你机会明天试身手
Give you a fighting
chance for tomorrow.

174
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,270
你小有名气
You may have earned
your reputation,

175
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,070
但没遇过我这种强敌吧
but not fighting against
a gladiator like me.

176
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
看起来你输定了
You made that a little too obvious.

177
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,420
我看起来输定了吗？
Did I make that too obvious?

178
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
贝雷特！
Bellator!

179
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,290
让开
Get away!

180
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,250
别挡路
Get out of the way! Get up, scum!

181
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
起来，人渣

182
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,880
回去干活
Back to work!

183
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,880
你为什么救我一命？
Why did you save my life?

184
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,180
斗士不该死于背后一刀
No gladiator should die
from a blade to the back.

185
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,030
要死也要死于正面攻击
When you die, the blow
will come from the front.

186
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,410
我保证明天就是你死期
I promise it will be tomorrow.

187
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,460
我会亲手证明
And it will come from my hand.

188
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,090
我能给你更好的保证
Well, I can make you
a better promise.

189
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,920
到时，你会死得很快
When the time comes,
your death will be quick.

190
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,020
我会亲手证明
And it will come from my hand.

191
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,270
别担心，你的计划完美无瑕
Don't worry. Your plan is
nothing short of brilliance.

192
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,990
只有疯子才会劝阻皇帝投资
Only a mad man would advise the
Emperor against investing.

193
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,790
但愿皇帝不会派来疯子
Well, let us hope that the
Emperor has not sent us one.

194
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,950
Keep up in time.

195
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,880
议员，原谅我们无法去港口接您
Senator,
do forgive us for not being able
to receive you at the harbor.

196
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,220
赛佛勒斯
Severus, you're a busy man.
I understand entirely.

197
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,020
你是大忙人，我完全谅解

198
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,030
再说如果我有像你这种娇妻
Besides, if I had a wife
as beautiful as yours,

199
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,450
我一定不急着离开她身边
I'd be in no hurry to
forsake her company.

200
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,290
我是昆塔亚兹科佛斯议员
I am Senator Quintas Attius Corvus.

201
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,710
愿神明容我为你们的款待祈福
May the gods grace me to
bless your kind hospitality.

202
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,130
您太客气了，议员
You're most welcome, Senator.

203
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,470
议员，告诉我们罗马的消息
So, Senator, tell us
the news from Rome.

204
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,850
新皇帝提图斯即位顺利吗？
How does the new
emperor, Titus, fare?

205
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,690
"新"皇帝？
The "new" emperor?

206
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,160
新皇帝提图斯很顺利
The new emperor, Titus, fares well.

207
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,700
他父亲维斯帕先受到人民爱戴
His father, Vespasian,
was loved by his people,

208
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,210
他们会爱屋及乌
and they continue that
love for his son.

209
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,750
正如神旨
- As the gods demand?
- Indeed.

210
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,710
确实

211
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,630
赛佛勒斯，我想向你请教
Severus, I have a question for you.

212
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,340
我从港口到这里
On my journey from the harbor,

213
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,590
我注意到有些镇民背对着我
I noticed some of your townsfolk
turned their backs towards me.

214
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,270
那不会造成问题吧？
There wouldn't be some kind
of problem, would there?

215
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,690
当地人怨恨罗马？
Some local resentment against Rome?

216
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,080
不，不成问题
No. Nothing of the sort.

217
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,900
只有少数弱势反对我们的计划
A tiny...
A miniscule minority of
opposition to our plans.

218
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,400
但新建设会向人民证明有新的沟渠
But our new construction
will provide the people
with a new aqueduct,

219
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,940
更好的卫生，更大的浴场
better sanitation, bigger
bath houses, a new arena.

220
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,270
新的竞技场

221
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,900
崭新的庞贝城
A whole new Pompeii.

222
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,540
讲新皇帝不恰当吗？
What was all that about
the new emperor?

223
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,300
他是政客，留意你的发言
He's a politician.
Be careful what you say to him.

224
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,050
你想我们能跟他做生意吗？
Do you think we can
do business with him?

225
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,100
如果皇帝没兴趣，他就不会来了
He wouldn't be here if the
Emperor wasn't interested.

226
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,030
爸为什么邀请罗马议员来家里？
Why would father invite a
Roman senator into our home?

227
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,080
你怎么能容忍这种事？
How could you allow such a thing?

228
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,000
想要罗马富豪来投资
If we want Rome's rich to
spend their money here,

229
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,540
就得依照他们的要求
we must keep up with
what they demand.

230
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,170
他们的要求？
What they demand?

231
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,930
爸不知道罗马的现况吗？
Does father have any idea what's
going on in Rome right now?

232
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,560
自从提图斯掌权，一切都走样了
Since Titus took power,
everything has changed.

233
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,560
皇帝只听小人的话
Every crooked man now has
the ear of the Emperor.

234
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,900
他们自认能为所欲为
And they assume that they can
take whatever they want.

235
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,030
凯西雅，你为什么提早回家？
Cassia, why did you
come home early?

236
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,950
罗马发生什么事？
What happened in Rome?

237
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,210
我只是受够了
I'd simply had my fill of it.

238
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,440
母亲，那是小飞吗？
Mother, is that Vires?

239
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,900
冷静，冷静
Whoa. Whoa. Easy! Easy!

240
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,220
小飞，你来这里干嘛？
Vires, what are you doing out here?

241
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,600
菲力在哪里？
Where's Felix?

242
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,600
我听说明天是你的最后一战
I heard tomorrow
is your last fight.

243
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,810
没错
That's right.

244
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,910
杀了你之后，他们就会给我自由
After I kill you, they
will give me my freedom.

245
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,910
别作梦了
They won't do it.

246
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,620
你这么强，不会放你
Not while your arm's still strong.

247
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,670
自由是罗马的承诺
Freedom is Rome's promise.

248
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,970
你相信他们会履行承诺？
You trust them to
keep that promise?

249
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,650
我相信他们的法律
I trust their law.

250
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,400
斗士只有一种自由
There's only one freedom
for a gladiator.

251
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,540
死在竞技场时不屈不挠
When you die in that arena,
you die unconquered.

252
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,000
当面唾弃罗马
And you spit in the eye of Rome.

253
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,430
那就是你的未来
Then this is your future.

254
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,930
你会以奴隶身分领死
And you die a slave.

255
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,240
我可不同
But not me.

256
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,370
明天罗马会信守承诺
Tomorrow, Rome will make
good on its promise.

257
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,550
可惜你不会活着见证我是对的
You, unfortunately, will not be
alive to see that I am right.

258
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,850
这么有自信？
So sure?

259
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,640
今天我发现你的弱点
Today you showed me
your weaknesses.

260
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,150
你的左臂比右臂没力
Your left arm is weaker
than your right.

261
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,080
所以你为了保护肋骨顾不得脖子
So you protect your ribs at
the expense of your neck.

262
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,210
那你变换重心时该加强攻击力道
And you should learn how to thrust
when you're shifting your weight

263
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,050
也别再偏重上方防卫
and stop favoring a high guard.

264
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,090
那样你就不会那么好猜
It would make you less predictable.

265
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
这个
This one.

266
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,240
那个
That one.

267
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,470
Mmm...

268
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,370
还有这两个
These two.

269
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,250
站起来，奴隶们
On your feet, slaves.

270
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,990
好
All right.

271
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,750
你站这里
You, here.

272
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,130
你，野蛮人，站这里
You, barbarian, here!

273
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,070
两个都是一流的斗士
Both excellent fighters.

274
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,490
一个是冠军
One, a champion,

275
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,000
另一个在乡下经过考验和鉴定
and the other, tried and
proven in the provinces.

276
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,550
我要看他的后面
I want to see him from behind.

277
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,510
干嘛这么严肃？
Why so serious?

278
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,650
这种夜班不错嘛
Not so bad for a night's work.

279
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,860
很结实
Firm.

280
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,780
但"武器"持久吗？
But what of his weaponry?

281
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,370
想一窥究竟可得付钱
That is an inspection
you'll have to pay for.

282
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,010
这会是新的竞技场
And this will be the new arena,

283
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,930
特别为战车竞赛设计
specifically designed
for chariot races.

284
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,690
好
Yes.

285
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,610
很详细，赛佛勒斯
Very detailed, Severus.

286
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,150
但我想这个计划不适合帝国投资
But I don't believe
that this project
is really suitable for
an Imperial investment.

287
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,160
皇帝对这种乡间嬉戏没兴趣
These dalliances in the countryside
hold very little interest
for the Emperor.

288
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,920
我听到传闻...
I was led to understand...

289
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,310
不，很遗憾皇帝的未来愿景
No. No. Unfortunately,
the Emperor's vision

290
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,660
是集中在罗马
for the future is
firmly fixed on Rome.

291
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,610
我倒是有兴趣投资
I, however, am
interested in investing.

292
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,150
很好
Good.

293
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,440
把合约拟好
Have the pledges drawn up.

294
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,620
明天比赛后，我就会签字
You'll have my mark on them
tomorrow. After your games.

295
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,000
想必接下来该喝酒了
I do believe a drink is in order.

296
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,500
当然，我们加入宾客好吗？
Of course. Shall we
join our guests?

297
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,130
也许令媛能端出来
Perhaps your daughter can bring it.

298
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,140
小女？
My daughter?

299
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
看那里
Look over there.

300
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,200
能跟马说话的奴隶
The slave who can talk to horses.

301
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,220
他真有男人味
He is a fine specimen.

302
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,760
你不能否认
Well, you can't deny it.

303
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,520
转身
Turn around.

304
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,880
凯西雅
Ah, Cassia.

305
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,430
我能占用你一下吗？
May I impose upon you for a moment?

306
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,180
有人要求见你
Your presence has been requested.

307
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,680
当然，父亲
Yes, of course, Father.

308
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,110
拿着，但不是给你的
You will need this.
It is not for you.

309
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,590
凯西雅，容我介绍...
Cassia, may I introduce...

310
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,800
科佛斯议员
Senator Corvus.

311
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,050
凯西雅小姐
Lady Cassia.

312
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,810
天啊，我好想你
My, how I have missed you.

313
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,360
你美极了
You are exquisite.

314
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,030
科佛斯议员，我无言以对
Senator Corvus,
I don't know what to say.

315
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,490
给我的？真体贴
For me? How kind.

316
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,540
你们彼此认识？
You two have met?

317
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,290
赛佛勒斯，你还在啊
Severus, you're still here.

318
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,170
我不知你认识小女
I did not know you
knew my daughter.

319
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,680
那你该听听来龙去脉
Then you should hear
the whole story.

320
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,690
明天在竞技场签约时再聊
Tomorrow in the arena
when I sign your pledges.

321
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,650
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,920
马克斯
Marcus?

323
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,180
议员和凯西雅在罗马就已相识
The Senator and Cassia
have already met, in Rome.

324
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,480
那她需要监护人
Then she requires a chaperone.

325
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,650
她没有我们都能在罗马熬过一年
She survived a year
in Rome without us.

326
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,160
她一定能在自家露台熬过十分钟
I'm sure she can survive
10 minutes on our balcony.

327
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,590
在罗马我以为我们有共识
In Rome, I thought we
had an understanding.

328
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,010
不，是你个人之见
No. You had an understanding.

329
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,300
我没给你机会
One for which I gave you no cause.

330
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,770
你光是出现就给了我机会，小姐
Your mere presence gives
me cause, My Lady.

331
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,480
像你这种美人
A beauty such as yours has no place

332
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,860
不该待在这种假日胜地
in a holiday resort like this.

333
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,150
当然像你这种尤物
Surely, a creature such as you

334
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,490
只属于永恒之城
can have no home but
in the Eternal City.

335
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,920
议员，我毫无意愿回去罗马
Senator, I have no intention
of returning to Rome.

336
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,260
倘若是以我妻子的身分回去呢？
And if you were to
return as my wife?

337
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,720
你妻子？
Your wife?

338
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,390
你能当作是恭维
You may consider it a compliment.

339
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,270
科佛斯议员，我想你误会我是...
Senator Corvus, I believe
you have mistaken me

340
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,360
在罗马坐你大腿的那种女人
for the kind of woman who drapes
herself across your lap in Rome.

341
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,990
我不愿成为你的妻子
I have no wish to become your wife.

342
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,030
断然拒绝，不出我所料
A spirited refusal.
I would have expected nothing less.

343
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,880
享受维纳丽亚节的尾声吧
Enjoy the remains of the
Vinalia, Senator. Good night.

344
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
晚安

345
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,240
这样正常吗？
Is this normal?

346
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,750
是火山，偶尔会有轰隆声
It is the mountain. It
grumbles from time to time.

347
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,360
把这个人带来，我需要他
Bring this man. I need him.

348
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
小姐  - 马上
- My Lady
- Now!

349
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,170
小姐，是小飞
My Lady, it's Vires!

350
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,970
拜托，免得它伤了自己
Please, before he injures himself.

351
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,930
我得单独进去
I have to go in alone.

352
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,770
不行
No.

353
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,940
让他进去
Let him.

354
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,900
小姐，他是野蛮人
My Lady, he's a savage.

355
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,280
让他进去
Let him.

356
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,620
冷静
Easy!

357
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,550
小姐，他不可靠
My Lady, he's not safe.

358
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,880
让开
Move.

359
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,190
在外面等
Wait outside.

360
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,300
你怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

361
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,680
我有问他
I asked him.

362
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,570
你在成为斗士前就会骑马？
You could ride before
you were a gladiator?

363
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,240
我在会走路前就会骑马
I could ride before I could walk.

364
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,000
我的族人曾经是驯马高手
My people were horsemen.

365
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,590
"曾经是"？
"Were" horsemen?

366
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,680
族人被罗马人赶尽杀绝
My family were butchered
by the Romans.

367
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,310
很遗憾
- I'm so sorry.
- "Sorry"?

368
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,350
遗憾？

369
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,940
罗马人哪会懂这些
What would a Roman
know of such things?

370
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,440
我不是罗马人，我是庞贝公民
I am not a Roman.
I'm a citizen of Pompeii.

371
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,450
为何到处可见罗马的鹰旗？
Then why do I see Rome's
eagle everywhere I turn?

372
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,030
这跟我无关
I'm no part of that.

373
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,670
在罗马待一年后
After a year in Rome, I hoped
never to see that eagle again.

374
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,170
我再也不想看那面鹰旗了

375
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,430
但那已经渗透到我家门外
And yet, here it is, thrust
into the soil outside my home.

376
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,270
家父相信他能跟那些禽兽协议
My father believes that he can
bargain with those animals.

377
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,440
换作我爸
My father...

378
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,120
会将他们诛尽杀绝
He would have killed
every last one of them.

379
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,760
小姐？
My Lady?

380
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,850
他们逮到你骑在马上会惩罚你
If they catch you up there
they'll punish you.

381
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,950
小姐？
My Lady?

382
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,010
小姐，一切还好吗？
My Lady, is everything all right?

383
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,780
Wait! Come back!

384
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,280
Come back!

385
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,390
怎么了？
What's wrong?

386
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,530
万一他们逮到你跟我在这里
If they catch you
up here with me...

387
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,490
我会说是我自愿
I'll tell them it was my choice.

388
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,260
他们在那里
There they are!

389
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,070
我得送你回去
I have to take you back.

390
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,080
不，你走，留下我
No. You go and leave me here.

391
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,580
你骑走就在机会
If you ride you have a chance.

392
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,370
什么机会？
- A chance at what?
- At freedom.

393
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,330
自由

394
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,430
但你要付出什么代价？
But at what cost to you?

395
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,730
告诉警卫我强行带你来这里
Tell the guards I brought
you here by force.

396
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
把责任归咎于我
The blame is mine.

397
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,950
把他拖下马
Get him off that horse!

398
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,790
不是他的错，马逃走，情况失控
It wasn't his fault. The horse
bolted. It was out of control.

399
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,980
议员，拜托，这奴隶救了我一命
Senator, please. This
slave saved my life.

400
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,400
他不该被处决
He does not deserve this.

401
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,280
凯西雅小姐，你没受伤吧？
Lady Cassia, you were unharmed?

402
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,160
我毫发无损
I'm perfectly all right.

403
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,670
要我放这奴隶生路
If I were to spare the
life of this slave,

404
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,250
你要回报我什么？
what would it be worth to you?

405
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:58,760
议员？
Senator?

406
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,100
想必你明白这个问题，可人儿
I believe you understand
the question, my dear.

407
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,110
我会很感激你的慈悲
I would be grateful for your mercy.

408
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,400
Well...

409
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,000
今天你走运，奴隶
This is your lucky day, slave.

410
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,500
凯西雅小姐救了你的小命
The Lady Cassia has
saved your life.

411
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,290
这奴隶是谁的？
Who owns this slave?

412
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,010
我的，议员
I do, Senator.

413
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,390
那我建议你惩一儆众
Then I suggest you punish
it and then remove it.

414
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,440
15鞭应该足够
Fifteen lashes should suffice.

415
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,900
毕竟慈悲是美德
After all, mercy is a virtue.

416
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,970
父亲，你得制止
Father, you have to stop this.

417
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,690
我爱莫能助
There's nothing I can do about it.

418
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,950
你救了他一命
You saved his life.

419
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,910
你已该庆幸
Content yourself with that.

420
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,720
科佛斯议员有求于你
Senator Corvus requires
a service of you.

421
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,390
我？
Of me?

422
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,280
这个斗士，你明天对他有何安排？
This gladiator.
What do you have planned
for him tomorrow?

423
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,660
他最后上场
He fights last.

424
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,960
跟我的冠军单挑
Single combat against my champion.

425
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,790
不行
No.

426
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,510
他最先上场，也最早送死
He fights first.
And he dies first.

427
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,490
他被鞭15下都没吭一声
Fifteen lashes and he
didn't make a sound.

428
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,080
我原本能阻止发生
I could have prevented this.

429
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,210
我乱了思绪
I don't know what I was thinking.

430
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,510
他让你感到活力
That he made you feel alive?

431
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,970
他让我感到安全
He made me feel safe.

432
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,980
那种男人不应当死在竞技场
A man like that does not
deserve to die in the arena.

433
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,780
这不是你的错，凯西雅
This is not your fault, Cassia.

434
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,580
他激怒议员了
He has caught the Senator's wrath.

435
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,720
我以为离开罗马他会忘记我
I thought that,
in leaving Rome, that man
would forget about me

436
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,300
转而觊觎别的倒霉鬼
and turn his attentions toward
some other poor victim.

437
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,820
今晚我看到他的眼神，阿丽德妮
I saw a look in that man's
eye tonight, Ariadne.

438
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,660
跟我在罗马看到的一样
The same look I saw in Rome.

439
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,450
但议员从未染指你？
But the Senator never
laid a hand on you.

440
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,670
幸好我在他动手前离开罗马
Only because I left
Rome before he could.

441
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,720
现在罗马跟随我们回到庞贝
Now Rome has followed
us back to Pompeii

442
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,180
会搞得天翻地覆
to turn the world inside out.

443
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,820
你真懂得准备比赛
You certainly know how
to prepare for a battle.

444
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,620
希望她值得
I hope she was worth it.

445
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,050
糟蹋了好酒
A terrible waste of good wine.

446
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,350
你有感觉到吗？
Can you feel that?

447
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,780
是诸神
It is the gods.

448
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,820
祂们对芸芸众生自有安排
They have a plan for us all.

449
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,740
也许吧
Perhaps.

450
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,330
什么意思？
What do you mean?

451
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,970
今晚我看到杀死我全家的人
Tonight I saw the man who
killed my whole family.

452
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,810
也许诸神让我存活有其理由
Perhaps the gods spared
me for a reason.

453
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,040
20年前罗马人夺走我的家庭
The Romans took my family
from me 20 years ago.

454
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,810
夜晚我努力回想他们的面孔
At night I try and remember
their faces, but I cannot.

455
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,140
但我想不起来

456
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,860
但我知道总有一天
But I know one day, the gods
will bring me to them again.

457
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,200
神会让我跟他们团聚

458
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,380
我叫米洛
My name is Milo.

459
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,560
阿提卡斯
Atticus.

460
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,530
你，那个隧道
You, that tunnel.

461
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,500
把凯尔特送进那个隧道
Send The Celt into that tunnel.

462
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,000
我以为他要跟阿提卡斯对打
I thought he was to fight Atticus.

463
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,460
你有新的指示
You're being given
new instructions.

464
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,420
是，主人
Yes, Master.

465
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,390
那阿提卡斯呢？
And Atticus?

466
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,480
他照常单挑
He'll fight single
combat as billed.

467
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,770
让他跟斯巴达大汉对打
Put him with the big Spartan.

468
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,830
给观众一场精彩比赛
He'll give the
audience a good show.

469
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,410
那阿提卡斯会打败他赢得自由
And Atticus will beat him
and win his freedom.

470
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,620
观众真的想看到这一幕？
Is that really what the
audience will want to see?

471
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,700
你想说什么？
What are you saying?

472
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,460
不觉得他们宁可看到...
Don't you think they'd rather see

473
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,630
斗士殉身而不是苟活？
a gladiator meeting
death rather than life?

474
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,590
尤其是壮烈牺牲？
Especially a death
as glorious as his?

475
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,310
站住
Stop.

476
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,020
你，那边
You.
That way.

477
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,920
你也是，野蛮人
You too, barbarian.

478
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,310
科佛斯议员
Senator Corvus.

479
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,440
凯西雅小姐
Lady Cassia.

480
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,610
过来坐我身边
Come sit beside me.

481
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,990
用你的智慧给我增光
Give me the benefit of your wisdom.

482
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,830
喜欢看这种竞赛吗？
Do you enjoy the sports?

483
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,670
看人互相残杀为乐，不算竞赛
Men killing each other for our
amusement is not a sport.

484
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,590
到处都是，全是新裂痕
Everywhere. All new.

485
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,480
我没空跟你扯，葛雷克斯
I don't have time for this, Graecus.
What are you suggesting?

486
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,480
你在暗示什么？

487
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,820
取消比赛？
That we cancel the games?

488
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,820
当然不是，只是延后
Of course not.
Merely postpone them.

489
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,790
这座竞技场已矗立一百年
This amphitheater has stood
for a hundred years.

490
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,580
禁得起大地震
It withstood the great earthquake.

491
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,920
可能不安全，睁亮眼
It may not be safe. Use your eyes.

492
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,100
声明在先，我无法负责不堪后果
I'm just saying I cannot
be held responsible
for what may happen.

493
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,600
那就不必，我负全责
Then don't be.
I take full responsibility.

494
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,650
我们哪能期望...
How can we expect Rome to trust
us to rebuild an entire city

495
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,360
罗马托付我们重建整座城市

496
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,500
要是我们办不成简单的格斗赛？
if we can't stage a
simple bloody spectacle?

497
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,210
拿我的行囊来，我要出城几天
Fetch my litter.
I'm leaving town for a few days.

498
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:30,770
快走！
Move.

499
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,840
站住，铐住他们
Stop. Shackle them!

500
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,770
这是干嘛？
What is this?

501
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,320
这是你最伟大的时刻，阿提卡斯
This is your greatest
moment, Atticus.

502
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,570
你在竞技场的末日
Your final day in the arena.

503
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,700
我应该要单挑的
I'm supposed to fight
single combat.

504
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,750
给他们武器
Bring them their weapons!

505
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,220
祝好运，阿提卡斯
Good fortune, Atticus.

506
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,870
赴死者，我们向你们致敬
To those about to
die, we salute you!

507
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,720
由马克斯卡西赛佛勒主持
By the patronage of
Marcus Cassius Severus

508
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,640
献给提图斯皇帝的盛世
and for the glory of Emperor Titus,

509
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,190
并特此谨记
remember, all here,
the mighty victory

510
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:40,530
科佛斯议员的非凡胜利
of Senator Quintas Attius Corvus

511
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,580
和他铲平凯尔特人叛乱的功迹
and his annihilation of
the Celtic Rebellion.

512
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,120
凯尔特人叛乱？
The Celtic Rebellion?

513
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,550
您为了帝国的伟大和高贵胜利
Your great and noble victory
for the Empire, Senator,

514
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,090
重开北方贸易路线
re-opening the
northern trade routes.

515
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,850
青史会记下您的壮举
The history books record
it as your finest hour.

516
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,940
我想您应该也想要光荣开赛
I thought perhaps you
might like the honor
of opening these games
in a similar manner.

517
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,650
赛佛勒斯，我受宠若惊了
Severus, you flatter me.

518
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,620
我们会让你享有罗马人的殊荣
We'll make a Roman out of you yet.

519
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,540
庞贝的子民
People of Pompeii!

520
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,380
愿朱比特和维纳斯
May Jupiter and Venus bless the
Vinalia and honor these games!

521
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,970
保佑维纳丽亚节并颂扬比赛

522
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,060
竞赛开始！
Let the games begin!

523
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,330
这不是格斗
- This isn't a battle.
- What?

524
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,160
什么？

525
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,620
这是屠杀
This is a massacre.

526
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,920
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

527
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,420
因为我是过来人
Because I was there.

528
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,680
反叛的凯尔特人正在撤离
The rebel Celts are in retreat,

529
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,400
留下强暴和杀戮尾随而至
leaving rape and
slaughter in their wake,

530
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,660
返回遭亵渎的巢穴
returning to their
unholy lair to feast

531
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,040
饱尝无辜受害者的血肉
on the flesh of their
innocent victims.

532
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,430
这就是你们受训的目的，人渣
This is what you've
trained for, scum.

533
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,850
赶快出来
Now get out there.

534
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,820
昆塔亚兹科佛斯
Quintas Attius Corvus gave them
every chance to surrender.

535
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,610
给予他们投降的每个机会

536
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:13,500
但慈悲对野蛮人来说是陌生概念
But mercy was an alien
concept to these savages,

537
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,470
怀抱沉重的心
and with heavy heart,
Quintas Attius Corvus

538
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,510
昆塔亚兹科佛斯

539
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,810
下令他的强大军团
ordered his mighty legions, in the
name of the Emperor, to attack.

540
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,480
以皇帝之名攻击！

541
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,110
举盾！
Shields up!

542
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,650
推进！
Push!

543
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,000
你称这是竞赛？
Is this what you call sport?

544
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,550
不，小姐，这不是竞赛
No, Lady Cassia, this is
not sport. This is politics.

545
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,010
这是政治

546
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,160
我们挡不住他们
We can't hold them!

547
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,330
后退
Back!

548
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,270
快跳

549
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,020
赛佛勒斯，我记得不该是这样
Severus, this is not
exactly how I remember it.

550
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,790
那奴隶对你有何意义？
What exactly is that slave to you?

551
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,870
跟你南辕北辙，议员
Everything that you
are not, Senator.

552
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,710
那你该很高兴得知
Then you should be pleased to learn

553
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,300
令尊已把你许配给我
your father has granted
me your hand in marriage.

554
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,140
什么？
- What?
- I made no such arrangement.

555
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,300
我没做过这种约定

556
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,100
因为他知道要是拒绝了
Because he knows
that if he does not,

557
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,270
我会通报提图斯皇帝
I will inform Titus that your
father has called into question

558
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:56,190
令尊质疑"新"皇帝的能力
our "new" emperor's
ability to rule.

559
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,660
皇帝会把你全家吊死在城墙
Titus will have your entire
family hung from the city walls.

560
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,270
米洛！
Milo!

561
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,680
如果我要嫁给你
If I were to marry you...

562
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,010
凯西雅
- Cassia...
- If I marry you,

563
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,220
如果我嫁给你

564
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,190
我的家人能免于一死吗？
is my family spared?

565
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,780
你的家人就会成为我的家人
Your family will become my family,

566
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,790
受到皇帝的保护
under the protection
of the Emperor.

567
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,830
并拥有各种附带优势
With all of the benefits
that that implies.

568
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,300
庞贝...！
Pompeii! Pompeii! Pompeii!

569
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,340
议员
Senator!

570
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,680
我不会屈服于罗马的力量
I do not yield to
the power of Rome!

571
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:39,970
我唾弃它
I spit on it!

572
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,690
量他没这个胆
He would not dare.

573
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,110
庞贝...！
Pompeii! Pompeii! Pompeii!

574
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,790
加派士兵进入竞技场
Get a detachment in the arena now.

575
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,960
快去
Now!

576
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,530
你说的对，兄弟
You were right, brother.

577
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:10,910
他们承诺的一切全是谎言
Everything they promised,
nothing but lies.

578
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:25,350
赦免！赦免！赦免！赦免！
Live! Live! Live!

579
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,370
你到底想干嘛？
What do you think you're doing?

580
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,210
夫人，坐好
Madame, take your seat!

581
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,800
想活命就给我坐下
If you want to live
you will sit down!

582
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:42,930
马上
Now!

583
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,100
如果你现在杀他
If you kill him now, on the
tip of 100 Roman arrows,

584
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,360
万箭齐发

585
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,690
他会变成烈士而不是暴民
you make him a martyr to the mob.

586
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,240
你想要那样？
Is that what you want?

587
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,450
把革命带回家给皇帝？
To take home to your
Emperor a revolution?

588
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,030
况且如果你推翻这个决定
And if you reverse this decision,

589
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,750
你在罗马会有何风评？
how will it be spoken of in Rome?

590
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,330
大家会闲言闲语
They will whisper it
behind your back,

591
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,250
说你妻子不顺从你
that you have a wife who
does not obey your will.

592
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,800
你的名声能承受这种污点？
Can your reputation
bear such a weakness?

593
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:02,760
我可能成为你的妻子
I might become your wife,
but you will never break me.

594
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,260
但你绝对驯服不了我

595
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,720
我会驯服你
But I will break you,

596
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,610
你会温驯到站坐爬都唯我是从
and you will stay broken to
stand, sit or crawl as I decree.

597
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,240
听清楚了吗？
Do you understand me?

598
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,920
普罗克路斯，派人把她带回别墅
Proculus, have your guard
take her back to the villa.

599
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,170
把她关在那里
Keep her there.

600
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,270
我想婚礼应该在罗马举行
I think the wedding
shall be in Rome.

601
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,550
庞贝的子民
People of Pompeii!

602
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,770
庞贝的子民
People of Pompeii!

603
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,350
火神说话了
Vulcan speaks!

604
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,490
火神裁定那个人是庞贝的冠军
Vulcan decrees that man to
be the champion of Pompeii!

605
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:03,520
他值得挺身当面对抗罗马强权
Decrees that he is worthy to stand
face-to-face against
the might of Rome!

606
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,010
伟大的火神
Great Vulcan, we hear you
speak and will obey!

607
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,930
我们听到您说话并会遵循

608
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,950
普罗克路斯
Proculus...

609
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:18,700
让这些懦夫见识
Show these cowards
what really happens

610
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,000
胆敢挑战罗马强权的下场
when you dare to challenge
the might of Rome.

611
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,000
乐意之至
With pleasure.

612
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,390
快点
Come on! Come on!

613
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,440
快点

614
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,440
快走
Faster! Move it!

615
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,040
怎么回事？小姐？
What's going on? My Lady?

616
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,130
别碰她，放开她
Don't touch her! Let her go!

617
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,790
凯西雅
Cassia!

618
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:11,220
由昆塔亚兹科佛斯议员主持
By the patronage of Senator
Quintas Attius Corvus,

619
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,640
罗马的冠军
the champion of Rome,

620
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,520
马克斯普罗克路斯
Marcus Proculus, hero of
the Celtic Rebellion,

621
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,020
歼灭凯尔特人的英雄

622
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,200
现在会面对庞贝的新冠军
will now face the new champion
of Pompeii, The Celt,

623
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,490
凯尔特

624
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,620
展开单挑
in single combat!

625
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,230
提图斯皇帝万岁
All hail to Emperor Titus!

626
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,290
我知道你
I know you.

627
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,460
真的？
Really?

628
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,430
无论你想报什么仇
Well, whatever revenge you
think you're going to have,

629
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,850
恐怕你会失望
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

630
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,420
给这奴隶像样的剑
Bring this slave a better sword.

631
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,380
刀刃是钝的
This blade's dull.

632
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,750
是吗？
Is it?

633
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,140
给大家看一场好戏吧
Let's give them a good show, huh?

634
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,600
杀了他！
Kill him!

635
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,940
快杀了他！
Kill him now!

636
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,060
不！
No!

637
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:22,040
你很勇敢，我很佩服
You're brave. I'll give you that.

638
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,430
但野蛮人绝对敌不过罗马人
But no savage could ever
be the match for a Roman.

639
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,970
那我们20人呢？
How about 20 of us?

640
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,500
不要！
No!

641
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,430
等等，等等
Wait! Wait!

642
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,390
不要！
No!

643
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,680
怜悯我！
Mercy!

644
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,770
不要！不要！
No!

645
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,660
很高兴见到你，兄弟
Good to see you, brother.

646
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:02,540
我也是
And you.

647
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,950
欧蕾莉亚
Aurelia.

648
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,720
杀了他
Kill him.

649
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,730
杀了他
Kill him.

650
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,580
经过再三考虑
On further consideration,

651
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,840
我决定不投资你的小城市
I have decided not to
invest in your little city.

652
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,520
送我到港口
Get me to the harbor.

653
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,040
对不起
I'm sorry.

654
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:52,960
让开
Move. Move it!

655
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,380
让开

656
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,410
你！
You! Come here!

657
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,580
过来这里

658
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,930
我的船费
For my passage.

659
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,850
让他上船
Let him aboard.

660
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,940
你们要赶快离开
You must leave now!

661
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,150
起锚，准备启航
Cast off! Prepare to set sail!

662
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,020
救命

663
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,940
救命
Help me! Please!

664
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:21,600
你...
You...

665
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,100
你一定要帮助我们
You have to help us.

666
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,240
你一定要解救凯西雅
You have to save Cassia.

667
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,030
她在哪里？
Where is she?

668
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,490
别墅
The villa.

669
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,730
你要去哪里？
- Where are you going?
- I have to find her.

670
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:29,850
我要去找她

671
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,280
米洛，别异想天开了
Milo, this is madness!

672
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,280
我们要去港口，找艘船
We have to get to the
harbor and find a boat.

673
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,070
火山会烧死所有人
The mountain is going
to kill us all!

674
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,040
她为了我冒生命危险，阿提卡斯
She risked her life
for me, Atticus.

675
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,170
为了我不顾一切
Risked everything for me!

676
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,920
没有她，我们早就死在竞技场
Without her, they would have
killed us in that arena!

677
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:44,970
那我们一起去
Then we will go together.

678
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,010
不行
No.

679
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,520
你获得你的自由，我的朋友
You have your freedom, my friend.

680
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,190
现在她是我的目标
Now she is mine.

681
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,280
那我们在港口碰面
Then we meet at the harbor.

682
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,620
港口见
At the harbor.

683
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,650
拜托，给我钥匙
Please, give me the keys!

684
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,620
凯西雅，他们拿走钥匙
Cassia, they've taken the keys!

685
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,160
No!

686
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:34,010
她在哪里？
Where is she?

687
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,460
拿水来
Water!

688
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,900
你为了我回来
You came back for me.

689
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,210
喝吧
Drink. Drink.

690
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:16,600
谢谢，姊妹
Thank you, sister.

691
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,670
不要！
No!

692
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,720
不要！
No!

693
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,500
看着我
Look at me.

694
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,670
我们要赶去港口
We have to get to the harbor.

695
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,330
这样是自杀，回头
This is suicide. Turn around! Back!

696
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:36,290
回去

697
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:37,880
让路
Out of the way!

698
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,090
让路
Get out of the way!

699
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,330
够了
Enough!

700
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,510
杀了他们，杀光他们
Kill them! Kill them all!

701
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,490
快划，白痴，快划
Row, you idiots! Row!

702
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,570
回头，你们得回头
Turn around! You have to turn back!

703
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,370
起来，起来
Come on. Get up! Get up!

704
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,040
不！
No! No, my daughter!

705
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,360
不！不！
Getup!

706
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,440
No!

707
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,880
我的女儿
My daughter!

708
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:28,760
妈咪
Mommy! Help!

709
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,970
这是世界末日吗？
Is this the end of the world?

710
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,770
为何神会让这种事发生？
Why would the gods let this happen?

711
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,470
米洛
- Milo!
- Atticus!

712
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,340
阿提卡斯

713
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:23,140
我知道诸神绝对抓不到你
I knew the gods would
never catch you.

714
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,350
你太快了，现在我懂原因了
There's none faster.
And now I see why.

715
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:29,280
该走了，我的朋友- 不行
- It's time to go, my friend...
- No.

716
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,360
港口不见了，我们得另找出路
The harbor's gone. We
have to find another way.

717
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,120
那我们往南进入丘陵
Then we have to go
south into the hills.

718
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,210
太远了，我们走路到不了
It's too far. We'll
never make it on foot.

719
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,330
那我们去那里
Then we go there.

720
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,670
竞技场？为什么？
The arena? Why?

721
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,800
有马
Horses.

722
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:58,750
我的父母亲
My parents.

723
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,550
我去牵马
I'll get the horses.

724
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,530
别去
Don't.

725
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,000
去帮你朋友
Go help your friend.

726
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,880
阿提卡斯？
Atticus?

727
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,370
到处是罗马人
Romans everywhere.

728
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,600
走吧
Let's go.

729
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,700
你最好舒服待着
You better get
comfortable, my dear.

730
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,910
到罗马还很远
It's a long way to Rome.

731
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,960
你为何这样做？
Why are you doing this?

732
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,920
因为凡是我的资产
Because the property of
Quintas Attius Corvus

733
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,750
不准被随便个奴隶抢去
will not be taken by some slave.

734
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,420
普罗克路斯，没你位子了
Proculus, there's not
enough room for you.

735
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,800
那我们罗马见，议员
Then I shall see you
in Rome, Senator.

736
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,430
科佛斯！
Corvus!

737
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,820
我悬赏一千取那奴隶的人头
1,000 dinari to the man who
brings me the head of that slave!

738
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,560
Hyah! Hyah!

739
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,960
现在换我了，快去
This is mine now. Go.

740
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:26,830
阿提卡斯
Atticus...

741
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,800
再不去就追不回她了
Every second takes her
further away from you.

742
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,940
后会有期，兄弟
I'll see you again, brother.

743
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:50,740
Hyah! Hyah!

744
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,460
Hyah!

745
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,080
Hyah!

746
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,320
Hyah! Hyah!

747
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,920
Hyah!

748
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:27,920
Hyah!

749
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,340
Go on!

750
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:06,330
野蛮人死不足惜，不像罗马人
A barbarian does not die
the equal of a Roman.

751
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:07,900
胡扯
Equal!

752
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:26,730
求求你

753
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:29,190
来瞧瞧罗马人
Let's see if a Roman

754
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,780
跟斗士决一死战的结果
can die the equal of a gladiator.

755
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,530
不要
No!

756
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:40,750
求求你
Please. Please.

757
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,130
求求你

758
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,350
斗士不会乞求
Gladiators do not beg.

759
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:05,850
Hyah!

760
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:57,220
贱人，你这贱人
Bitch! You bitch!

761
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,030
等等
Wait! Wait! Wait!

762
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:08,990
等等，等等

763
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,620
你跟我有何深仇大恨？
Who are you to do this to me?

764
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:13,670
我是昆塔亚兹科佛斯议员
I am Senator Quintas Attius Corvus!

765
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:20,920
那又怎样？昆塔亚兹科佛斯议员
And what is that worth,
Senator Quintas Attius Corvus?

766
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:36,940
你残杀我家人，屠杀我族人
You killed my family,
you slaughtered my people,
and make no mistake,

767
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:36,760
无庸置疑

768
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,300
我的神找上你了
my gods are coming for you.

769
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:53,580
等等
Wait!

770
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,210
你不能把我留在这里
You can't leave me here!

771
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,190
赴死的同袍
For those of us about to die...

772
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,910
我们向你们致敬
We salute you!

773
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,830
我以自由之身死去
I die a free man!

774
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,050
你快把马骑走
You have to ride him out of here.

775
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:43,840
不要
- No!
- He's not fast enough.

776
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,880
它不够快

777
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:47,180
载不了我们两人，快走
He can't carry us both! Go!

778
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,720
不要，我不会丢下你
No, I won't leave you!

779
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:50,690
你别无选择
We don't have a choice.

780
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:54,490
快跑，快走
Run! Go!

781
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:00,960
我不愿浪费最后相聚的一刻逃命
I don't want to spend our
last moments running.

782
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,810
别看
Don't look.

783
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:13,980
看着我
Look at me.

784
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,030
只要看着我
