THE RULES OF THE GAME

A Dramatic Fantasy

"This entertainment, set on the eve
of the Second World War,

7
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,450
does not claim to be
a study of manners.

8
00:01:57,628 --> 00:02:00,791
Its characters are purely fictitious."

"Sensitive hearts, faithful hearts

Who shun love whither it does range

11
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,802
Cease to be so bitter

12
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,375
Is it a crime to change?

13
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:15,774
If Cupid was given wings

14
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:19,746
Was it not to flitter?"

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,963
<i>You're listening to Radio-Cité.
It's exactly 10:00 p.m.</i>

16
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:37,123
We're here
at Le Bourget airfield,

17
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:42,531
working our way through the crowd
that's turned out to welcome

18
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,232
the famous aviator André Jurieu,

19
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:48,706
who has just performed
a tremendous feat:

20
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,042
Crossing the Atlantic in 23 hours!

21
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,582
A record comparable...
Watch the cord!

22
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:59,587
A record comparable only
to the one set a dozen years ago

23
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,190
by Charles Lindbergh.

24
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,553
The crowd's moving!

25
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:14,937
Jurieu has arrived safe and sound,
executing a magnificent landing.

26
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:19,572
The crowd is invading the airfield
and crashing the police cordon.

27
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:07,781
The minister couldn't make it, but
he asked me to convey his admiration

28
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,256
and sincerest congratulations.

29
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:12,361
It's really the plane's doing.

30
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,192
Not at all.
It's a fine achievement.

31
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,033
Octave!

32
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,902
André! Am I ever happy!
Not about your flight!

33
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,804
It's you I'm glad to see!
It is you, isn't it?

34
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:30,140
Is she here?

35
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:33,977
She didn't come?

36
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,420
- She didn't come?
- She couldn't make it.

37
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:40,952
But I did this all for her!

38
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,149
I know.

39
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:45,462
Mr. André Jurieu,
a few words for our listeners.

40
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:47,923
Just a few words.
- What can I say?

41
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:51,067
You just flew solo over the Atlantic.

42
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:55,899
You must have something to say.
Anything. You must be happy.

43
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,668
I'm very unhappy.

44
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:01,902
I've never been
so disappointed in my life.

45
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,977
I made this flight for a woman.

46
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,515
She's not here to welcome me.

47
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,381
She didn't even bother.

48
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,453
I tell her this publicly:
She's disloyal!

49
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:19,025
<i>The great aviator has performed
a stunning feat.</i>

50
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,927
<i>But remember,
it's cost him a great deal of effort,</i>

51
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,760
<i>and he's exhausted.</i>

52
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,397
My purse, Lisette.

53
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:28,102
<i>He can't really talk.</i>

54
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:31,708
<i>But we have here with us
an engineer from Caudron.</i>

55
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,608
Jurieu's aircraft
was manufactured by Caudron.

56
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,877
It's a standard model with
a 200-horsepower Renault engine.

57
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:47,022
The copilot's seat was replaced
by an extra fuel tank.

58
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:52,720
You're a hero, but you just behaved
like a spoiled kid.

59
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:55,297
If Christine won't see you,
serves you right.

60
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,965
- I couldn't face her now.
- Get some sleep first.

61
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:03,297
Tell me, Lisette,
how long have you been married?

62
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,235
- Almost two years, Madame.
- That's true.

63
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:10,170
How time flies! Are you happy?

64
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:12,315
My husband's no trouble.

65
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:15,509
He's in service at the château
and I'm in Paris.

66
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:17,745
With you, Madame, I'm very happy.

67
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,955
- Do you have lovers?
- That's a big word.

68
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,424
Of course you do.
Octave, for example.

69
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,692
Give me my evening lipstick.

70
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:31,263
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh, yes, you do.

71
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,706
I don't like it. Too purple.

72
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,671
It doesn't look natural.

73
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,076
What's natural nowadays?

74
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,751
And your lovers...
What do they say to you?

75
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,046
Not much.

76
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,156
- Do they kiss you?
- If I let them.

77
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,152
- Do they hold your hand?
- It depends.

78
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,725
- And then what?
- Then what?

79
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:03,560
Same old story: The more you give,
the more they want.

80
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,169
My scarf.

81
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,969
Nothing doing.
Men are all the same.

82
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:15,904
What about friendship?

83
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,009
Friendship with a man?

84
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,543
When pigs have wings!

85
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,348
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening, Lisette.

86
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:38,861
- Mitzi...
- Yes, Madame?

87
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,664
- Did you take the dogs out?
- Yes, Madame.

88
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,805
- Where is Monsieur?
- In his study.

89
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,869
<i>Calm has returned
to Le Bourget airfield.</i>

90
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:52,709
<i>The crowd is breaking up peacefully.</i>

91
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:55,181
<i>The victory reception is over.</i>

92
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:58,446
<i>We've just witnessed an event
that will go down...</i>

93
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,858
- We're late, my dear.
- As usual.

94
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,557
A new one?
- I got it today.

95
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:09,095
It's a romantic Negress.
In perfect working order.

96
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,938
I prefer it to the radio.

97
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:22,204
So, you heard
what André Jurieu said?

98
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:28,512
I can well imagine what he thought.
He'd risked his life.

99
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,280
How could you have refused him

100
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:36,482
that small token of affection

101
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,493
he must have
pleaded for so touchingly?

102
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,223
He mistook it for love.

103
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,223
Men are so naïve.

104
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,633
How happy that makes me!

105
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:49,165
Thank you.
- It's nothing.

106
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:56,376
Telling lies is such
a heavy weight to bear.

107
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,742
Lies... Don't exaggerate.

108
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,460
Would you call me a liar?

109
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:15,629
I trust you completely.

110
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,522
Do you?

111
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,636
Excuse me a minute, my dear.

112
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,119
Madame de Marras, please.

113
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:45,192
Is that you, Geneviève?
I must see you.

114
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,563
Then come over now.

115
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,229
You're going out with Christine?

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,300
In the morning, then.

117
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:57,031
Not at 10:00. Yes, 11:00.
Be realistic.

118
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,312
<i>La Chesnaye must be in a state.</i>

119
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,076
- So why does he have a wireless?
- Progress.

120
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:10,948
You call that progress?
I call it exhibitionism.

121
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,419
I feel sorry for Christine,
because she's a foreigner.

122
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:17,184
And because
you have a crush on her.

123
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:21,763
No, but it must be hard
to leave the life she had in Austria.

124
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:25,390
An artist's life. Her father
was a famous conductor in Vienna.

125
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,569
And to move to Paris
where nobody speaks her language.

126
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,766
- Why did she marry? I didn't!
- Oh, you!

127
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,706
What's on your mind?

128
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:38,878
A maxim by Chamfort.
It could almost be a precept.

129
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,448
What does he say?

130
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:45,020
"Love as it exists in society
is merely the mingling of two whims

131
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,020
and the contact of two skins."

132
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:53,019
If I understand you right,
you want to leave me.

133
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:56,894
Last night I suddenly decided
to be worthy of my wife.

134
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:01,835
I see the family picture: Knitting,
the slippers and lots of children.

135
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:06,101
Exactly. I sort of feel now
that I've had my fun.

136
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,778
All this because of the radio
and André Jurieu.

137
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:11,744
How perceptive you are!

138
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,844
Let's say we do split up.

139
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,952
What would change with Christine?

140
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,451
Why, everything.

141
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,655
Nothing!
She's remained so Austrian.

142
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:25,727
A Parisian woman would understand.
Not her.

143
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:31,131
If she found out, it's not
our affair she'd hold against you,

144
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,401
but the fact that you lied
from the start.

145
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,596
She'd never forgive you.

146
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,167
I know.

147
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,340
Believe it or not,
you mean a lot to me.

148
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,710
I don't know if it's love
or force of habit,

149
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,212
but if you leave me, I'll be very
unhappy, and I don't want to be.

150
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:53,388
My dear, I'm so sorry.

151
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:57,416
I didn't intend to hurt you,
but put yourself in my shoes.

152
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,887
A good thing you're weak.

153
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,394
I take after my father.

154
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:07,799
The poor man
had such a complicated existence.

155
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:11,069
Let's go to lunch.
- With pleasure.

156
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,807
I don't know if it's
this sentimental talk,

157
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:15,611
but I'm famished!

158
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,228
No, old man! Go on if you want,
but I'm walking home.

159
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,711
- Don't leave me alone.
- Damn your problems!

160
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:55,181
Since you got back,
you haven't stopped bending my ear.

161
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,513
And now you drive us into a ditch.

162
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,417
Thanks, but no thanks!

163
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:00,613
Are you hurt?

164
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:05,421
I wonder if I'm not dead.
I hit the roof like a feather.

165
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,060
It's rattled my brains.

166
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:11,860
Want to kill yourself over Christine?
Go ahead, but without me.

167
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:13,829
- Understand...
- I do. You're nuts!

168
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:16,801
- So I'm nuts!
- Get help and get off my back.

169
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:20,075
You'd gladly see me put away.
You love her, too.

170
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:22,309
Sure I do, in my own way.

171
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:25,471
So you can't have her
like a glass of wine.

172
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,484
Get this:
She's like a sister to me.

173
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,314
We grew up together.

174
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:35,356
Her father, old Stiller, wasn't just
the greatest of conductors.

175
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,857
He was also the best of men.

176
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:42,154
When I went to study music
with him in Salzburg,

177
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,425
he treated me like a son.

178
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,536
I never got to show him my gratitude.

179
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,902
Now I can. He's not here to look
after his daughter anymore.

180
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:54,669
So I can and will look after her.
She needs looking after.

181
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:59,873
She's a foreigner among people
who don't speak her language.

182
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,917
If you want to make her happy,
let her come with me.

183
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,816
Because I love her.

184
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,651
Seeing her with that idiot
La Chesnaye!

185
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,385
Him and his hunts,
château and mechanical birds!

186
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,324
A two-timing snob!

187
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,863
He may be a snob,
but he's got his feet on the ground.

188
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,830
Your head's in the clouds.

189
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,800
You put your foot in your mouth,
like on the radio.

190
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,902
At Le Bourget when you got back.

191
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:29,444
You're back from America
after breaking all sorts of records.

192
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,110
You get a hero's welcome.
Ministers make speeches.

193
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,047
But instead of modestly and calmly
playing your part as a national hero,

194
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:42,619
instead of giving radio audiences
the twaddle they expect,

195
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:46,923
you start sounding off
about Christine. In public!

196
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,031
No wonder she won't see you!

197
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:52,633
But I did it for her,
for her alone, understand?

198
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,234
She encouraged me.
So when she didn't show up...

199
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,533
She's a society woman,
and society has strict rules.

200
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,541
I don't need lectures.

201
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,645
I need Christine.

202
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,914
I love her, you know.

203
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,918
If I don't see her again, I'll die.

204
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:17,818
You'll see her again.

205
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,488
- Think so?
- Sure you will.

206
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,056
Leave it to me.

207
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,664
So, Mr. Octave!

208
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,201
No hello?

209
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:32,539
Fresh as a rose.

210
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,906
But you look awful.
What's the matter?

211
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:38,281
I bet it's your pilot friend again.

212
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,474
What a nuisance!
Madame can't sleep at night.

213
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,142
Listen here. Do you trust me?

214
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:46,989
I'll settle it.
- Really?

215
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:49,125
Where have you been?

216
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,021
I've been very busy.

217
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:53,958
- Problems?
- I'll tell you later.

218
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,031
You came to see my wife?
Let me say good morning.

219
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,863
- What's that you got: A nightingale?
- A warbler.

220
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:06,008
- Looks like the moths got to it.
- But it still sings every 20 seconds.

221
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,177
- I bet it does.
- Cynic.

222
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,872
Where have you been all this time?

223
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,447
Were you away?

224
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,581
May I?

225
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:21,216
Good morning, my dear.
Sleep well?

226
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,084
Say, Lisette.

227
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:29,596
<i>- I got a letter from Shoemaker.
- Schumacher!</i>

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,268
Your husband. He says that
without her, my woods lack poetry,

229
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:38,201
and his gamekeeper's job
seems utterly dreary.

230
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:41,037
He wants you to join him.

231
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:45,872
And leave Madame?
Your lordship, I'd rather divorce.

232
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,479
Don't get melodramatic.

233
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,445
Are you two done talking?

234
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:54,317
Oh, yes,
you have a big secret for her.

235
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,389
You said it.

236
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:57,526
- I'll leave you.
- About time, too.

237
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:00,458
- Coming out to "La Colinière"?
- Maybe.

238
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,029
What did I say?
Twenty seconds.

239
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,170
A cup of tea?

240
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,403
A nice hot coffee
with bread and jam?

241
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,912
I'm not hungry.

242
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,709
Something's definitely out of order.

243
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:23,944
I've never seen Mr. Octave
without an appetite.

244
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:25,681
Won't you sit down?

245
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,458
Come now, tell me your secret.

246
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,219
- It's about André.
- Oh, no!

247
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:35,160
- You know he wanted to die?
- That's just talk.

248
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:37,056
Excuse me, but I was there.

249
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:39,201
How could he?

250
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:43,973
How? Why, in his car.
He tried to drive into a tree.

251
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:47,106
- And it's my fault?
- It sure is your fault.

252
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,411
- I don't understand.
- Don't you?

253
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,044
Listen, my dear.

254
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:55,075
You throw yourself around people's
necks like a 12-year-old.

255
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:57,645
You can do it with me.

256
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:00,915
You'll always be
my little Salzburg girl.

257
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:04,627
But with others
it can be... awkward.

258
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:10,428
So, in Paris, you can't show a man
affection without...

259
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:15,069
So I'm to blame for everything?

260
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,934
Not everything. Just a few things.

261
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,910
Must I apologize to your friend?

262
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:22,874
That's going a bit far.

263
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:26,015
But you might...
invite him to "La Colinière."

264
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,217
You're so improper!

265
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,877
In that case... I'm going.

266
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:34,080
Good-bye. Or rather, farewell.

267
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:38,083
- Where are you going?
- To see him.

268
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:41,754
You won't come out
to "La Colinière"?

269
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,626
I can't cut myself in two.

270
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:47,994
You silly thing!

271
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:51,641
You foolish old dear!

272
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:56,002
- So you'll invite him?
- I'll invite him.

273
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,171
I don't want to be
the woman who drove to despair

274
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:02,408
the great hero,
the idol of the masses.

275
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:06,187
If his plane crashes,
they'll blame it on me.

276
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:10,788
They'll call me a vamp,
public enemy, obstacle to progress.

277
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,255
They'll talk about "the foreigner."

278
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,263
And I hate martyrs.

279
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,830
And your husband...
what'll you do about him?

280
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:22,602
That's your business.

281
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:26,299
I've done my part.
I wash my hands of the rest.

282
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:30,674
<i>- Christine, du bist ein Engel.
- An angel?</i>

283
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,775
A dangerous angel,
but an angel nonetheless.

284
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,789
Cook me up two fried eggs,

285
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,394
a big slice of ham and a glass
of white wine. I'm starved!

286
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:49,256
- You'll put on weight.
- Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

287
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,706
All right, then.
I'll expect you at "La Colinière."

288
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,699
You have your own car, fine.

289
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:02,939
See you tomorrow.

290
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:08,008
I'm in a terrible predicament.
- Geneviève.

291
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,779
- You know?
- Who doesn't? Sick and tired of her?

292
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,884
But you want to end it?
Leave it to me.

293
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,118
If you could.

294
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:22,230
Easy enough. She's dying to get
married, so we'll get her hitched.

295
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,690
To whom? To you?

296
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:28,360
Oh, me, you know,
I'm not the marrying kind.

297
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,631
I'd be ready to sacrifice myself.

298
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,775
But only for Christine.
- I know.

299
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,477
But I need a favor in return.

300
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,445
You need money?

301
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,278
You know you're a decent guy?

302
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,385
I take after my mother.

303
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,188
I want you to invite André Jurieu.

304
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:50,991
To "La Colinière"?

305
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:53,852
That's a very serious request.

306
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:55,694
Serious?

307
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,925
I know what happened
between Christine and your friend.

308
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,831
I'm not blind.
- Nothing happened.

309
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:03,632
A good thing, too!

310
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:06,136
Then invite him.

311
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,578
I'd be taking a big risk.
I love Christine.

312
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,804
I'd never get over losing her.

313
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:17,080
You know what?
I feel like skedaddling.

314
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:21,422
I want to disappear down a hole.

315
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,683
What for?

316
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,296
So as not to have to figure out
what's right and what's wrong.

317
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:32,931
The awful thing about life is this:
Everyone has their reasons.

318
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,932
Of course they do.

319
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
And I'm all
for their free expression.

320
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,669
I'm against barriers and walls.

321
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:43,472
And that's why I'll invite André.

322
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:46,916
- Is it the right thing to do?
- I have faith in Christine.

323
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:50,145
If she loves Jurieu,
separating them won't stop her.

324
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:53,614
They might as well
see each other and talk it over.

325
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:58,960
You know, we could get Geneviève
together with André.

326
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:01,187
You idiot!
That would be way too practical.

327
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,832
I'll get dressed.
Staying for breakfast?

328
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,532
Yes, I'm staying.

329
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,728
Your lordship,
about "La Colinière"...

330
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,566
See my secretary.

331
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,732
- Is Madame bringing her dogs?
- Ask Madame.

332
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,143
My screw!

333
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,442
Move this bench away.

334
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,386
It's the screw for my warbler.
- I understand, sir.

335
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:27,750
My dear, put that on the table.

336
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:29,824
I have some big news.

337
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:34,191
"My pilot," as you call him,
will be with me at "La Colinière."

338
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,557
The things you dream up!

339
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:41,267
The things I dream up?
Dream up!

340
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:59,017
Excuse me! You know,
you're no fool, you're a poet.

341
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:01,190
A dangerous poet.

342
00:23:31,454 --> 00:23:32,614
Your lordship.

343
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,763
Excuse me for bringing this up
while on duty.

344
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:45,090
It's about my wife.
- You wrote me, my friend.

345
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:49,705
With my wife in Paris
and me out here, it's hardly a life.

346
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,998
I feel like a widower.
What did his lordship decide?

347
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,939
What's there to decide?

348
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,945
If your wife wants to be with you,
it's her decision.

349
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:00,582
Very good, your lordship.

350
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,014
- I'm so glad to be here.
- So am I.

351
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:08,615
I lit the stove
and stocked all the fireplaces.

352
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,780
Inform Corneille.

353
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,928
- How is Gertrude?
- Just fine, your ladyship.

354
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:15,256
Was the coal delivered?

355
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:16,625
And the wood brought in?

356
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,959
Very good.

357
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:21,060
- Hello, Lisette.
- Hello, Edouard.

358
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,632
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

359
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,006
- Here you are, at last.
- Yes, here I am.

360
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:33,346
What's that?

361
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:37,047
It's Mr. Des Réaux's people.
They're shooting rabbits.

362
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,381
What keeps you from doing the same?

363
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:43,214
We've already put up fences
at Epinereaux and Tixier.

364
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:47,657
Along with what the gamekeepers
ferreted, we've killed about 250.

365
00:24:47,997 --> 00:24:48,929
Is that all?

366
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:52,033
With the full moon,
we kill fewer than usual.

367
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,336
We need to put up wire fencing
to protect the plantation.

368
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,770
- I don't want any fencing.
- Yes, your lordship.

369
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:01,842
Nor do I want any rabbits.
Work it out.

370
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:06,072
- May I continue my rounds?
- Of course, Schumacher.

371
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,548
We'll head towards Foucherolle.

372
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,655
Musette! Here, girl!

373
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:23,096
What did the boss say?

374
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,092
He doesn't want fencing or rabbits.

375
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,433
How are we supposed
to work it out?

376
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,942
It's that pest of a miller's cat.

377
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:40,740
He's a real nuisance.

378
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,956
He's no nuisance now.

379
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,958
Marceau deserves the same treatment.

380
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:55,120
Marceau takes us for idiots.

381
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:57,198
But it won't last much longer.

382
00:26:07,877 --> 00:26:10,539
- What'd you find, girl?
- A rabbit in a snare.

383
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,441
Marceau sets snares all over.
Leave them. Don't tip him off.

384
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,415
- He won't be by today.
- At dawn?

385
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,852
If he goes on a binge,
he won't be up early.

386
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,548
That bum's got it too easy.
What do we do?

387
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,391
Watch out for him.

388
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,232
There's one!

389
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:20,909
Hello, Marceau.

390
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,077
Hello, Schumacher. How are you?

391
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:27,846
Want my rabbit?

392
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,793
Give it here.

393
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:38,693
Go on, walk.

394
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,311
Get a move on!

395
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:01,388
- What's going on?
- Marceau, your lordship.

396
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,617
- Marceau who?
- Marceau the poacher.

397
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:05,761
Come here.

398
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:09,058
- We caught him red-handed.
- Doing what?

399
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:11,557
Setting snares at woods' edge.

400
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:15,100
To destroy rabbits?
Why, the man's valuable! Let him go!

401
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:18,105
- Is his lordship serious?
- He understands me.

402
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:21,107
He's an intelligent guy,
not like this big bully!

403
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:23,302
Bully?
I'll teach you manners.

404
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,811
Scum like you should be shot.

405
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,779
Just for a tiny little rabbit!

406
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,476
- So your name is Marceau?
- Yes, your lordship.

407
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:32,553
- You're a poacher?
- Actually, I mend chairs.

408
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:37,022
But times are tough even in my line.
His lordship understands me.

409
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,658
So I try to keep busy.
- Call that busy?

410
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:42,229
Back in the war,
I had men shot for less.

411
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:43,729
That's enough.

412
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:47,391
I like your face.
- His lordship's kind.

413
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,069
He's riffraff!

414
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:50,296
Enough.

415
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,003
Rather than work as an amateur,
would you like to kill rabbits for me?

416
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:57,846
His lordship wants to hire me?

417
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,411
I won't say no.

418
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:02,915
If I poach, it's not out of spite.

419
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,251
It's to feed my aging mother.

420
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:06,750
He has none!

421
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:10,392
What?
I don't have an aging mother?

422
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:13,024
Continue your rounds.
Leave me alone.

423
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:17,191
Say, Marceau.

424
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:23,936
You must have set other snares.
Will you show me one?

425
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,699
Being in your lordship's
service now, I can't refuse.

426
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:31,013
This way.

427
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:39,648
Over here, your lordship.
Here's a snare.

428
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,683
It's set in the wrong place.
- Why?

429
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:45,418
This trail isn't used anymore.
I should've noticed.

430
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:48,324
- We all make mistakes.
- No, it's annoying.

431
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,728
If Schumacher saw this,
I'd never hear the last of it.

432
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:55,393
- You can count on my discretion.
- Thanks, your lordship.

433
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:59,201
So, glad to be working for me?

434
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,173
Sure, but I'd rather work
at the château.

435
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,939
Why? Don't you like the woods,
Mother Nature?

436
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:09,777
With Schumacher around, not really.
This is more his world than yours.

437
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:12,614
At the château,
he'd have to leave me alone.

438
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:15,817
I always dreamed
of being a domestic.

439
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:18,892
- That's funny. Why?
- Because of the outfit.

440
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:21,896
I've always dreamed
of wearing a uniform.

441
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,959
- Has it been raining long?
- A half hour. It was sunny at noon.

442
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:57,862
- Will it last?
- Last time it rained for two weeks.

443
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,330
Charming!

444
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,059
Her luggage.

445
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,131
Every time I come out here it rains.

446
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:07,537
It clears out the mind.

447
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:08,667
Hello, La Bruyère.

448
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,937
Will you allow me?

449
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:15,011
You're drenched.

450
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:17,775
Your scarf.

451
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,652
Where's your wife?

452
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:23,155
With Christine,
discussing housekeeping.

453
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,657
How interesting.
You came from Tourcoing?

454
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,591
Is it raining there?
- Like everywhere else.

455
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:32,097
It took eight hours to get here
via Paris. The roads are slippery.

456
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:34,429
A record.
Hello, Jackie.

457
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,935
How you've grown!
- Think so?

458
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:40,508
- You're studying Chinese, right?
- No, pre-Colombian art.

459
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,041
Sounds thrilling!

460
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:44,679
How are you, Charlotte?
- Hello, my dear.

461
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:46,106
Have you lost weight?

462
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,477
Watch out for yourself.
- I swear.

463
00:31:48,651 --> 00:31:50,744
What about these?
You can't fool me.

464
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:53,179
- Are you playing?
- I'll be right in.

465
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:55,619
Will you join us?
- Bridge bores me.

466
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,691
Who mentioned bridge?
It's belote!

467
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:00,452
Who does your hair, Geneviève?

468
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,736
- Did you really invite Jurieu?
- I did. Do you mind?

469
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,368
On the contrary.

470
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:21,112
- Isn't Jean here?
- He drove to Orleans for the fish.

471
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:24,616
Tell him about
Madame La Bruyère's diet.

472
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:28,023
She eats everything. But no salt.

473
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:33,728
On the contrary. But only sea salt.
And only once the food's cooked.

474
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:36,865
It's simple.
Even a child would understand.

475
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,397
- Do you have sea salt?
- No, but we'll see to it.

476
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:42,867
Adolphe, for Madame La Plante...

477
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,269
I almost forgot: No tea, just coffee.

478
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,673
And for the general,
a slice of lemon in hot water.

479
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,907
I know: Arthritis.

480
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:01,819
And for André Jurieu?

481
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:15,562
What do you think
of the diphtheria vaccine?

482
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:17,395
I don't know.

483
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:20,770
At the factory dispensary,
we've had very good results.

484
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:21,910
Really?

485
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:29,477
Find your suitcase?

486
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:33,119
My eldest had strep throat
and the youngest, measles.

487
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,382
You can imagine how worried I...

488
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:37,916
Who's that?

489
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:40,492
- André Jurieu.
- The aviator?

490
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:42,657
What luck!

491
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,933
I'll ask him for an autograph
for my eldest boy.

492
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,944
- So nice of you to come.
- You're very kind.

493
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:09,418
My dear André.
This is a pleasure.

494
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,893
It's an honor to have you.
You know everyone.

495
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,723
You haven't met my wife.

496
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,924
She'd like an autograph
for our eldest boy.

497
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,091
I hope we'll see you in Tourcoing.

498
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,600
You were magnificent.

499
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:25,968
My dear Jurieu,
I'm proud to shake your hand.

500
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:28,803
Very proud.
You're a man, a real man.

501
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,572
It's a vanishing breed.

502
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,274
You didn't fly in? I must kiss you.
Glad to see you here.

503
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,050
May I kiss you, too?

504
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,010
And me?

505
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:39,785
And me?

506
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,151
I'm entitled to.

507
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:54,666
It stays in the family.

508
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:58,834
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jurieu and Christine.

509
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,935
What's it to you?

510
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,340
We're here to hunt,
not to write our memoirs.

511
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,476
So, did they or didn't they?

512
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:09,451
They did.

513
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,852
A pity. He's so elegant.

514
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:14,647
Dear friends,

515
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:20,620
I must confess something regarding
my relationship with André Jurieu.

516
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:25,300
I had a small part to play
in his exploit.

517
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,100
This is how...

518
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:31,428
While preparing for his flight,
André came to see me often.

519
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:34,672
We spent long hours together.

520
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,612
Very pleasant hours.

521
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,017
Hours marked by the rare sign
of friendship.

522
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,955
He told me about his projects
and I listened.

523
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:49,552
It's important to listen.

524
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:52,460
In this case,
it wasn't a waste of time.

525
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:56,995
I'm very proud,
and I wanted you all to know it.

526
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,535
Aunt, I'm so happy.

527
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:04,230
- We'll throw a big party for Jurieu.
- Excellent idea.

528
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,931
We'll put on a show.
We'll masquerade!

529
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:08,872
Sure, we'll masquerade!

530
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,444
We'll have as much fun as we can.

531
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,072
When, General?

532
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:17,544
- A week from now, after the hunt.
- Perfect!

533
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:20,854
Christine, let's show him his room.

534
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,083
These young people are charming.

535
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:27,020
Saint-Aubin, some billiards.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:30,495
- Anyone for a game of ping-pong?
- Me.

537
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:31,991
Coming, Geneviève?

538
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,898
A party for what?

539
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:37,171
To raise funds for the dispensary.

540
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:42,033
- Your coat, madam.
- I'll take it off in my room.

541
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,307
That Mr. Jurieu is charming.

542
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:49,050
He must have a good position.
- Most likely.

543
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:54,081
- A perfect match for you, Jackie.
- André doesn't notice I exist.

544
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,749
I could arrange a little get-together
at my home in Tourcoing.

545
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:03,695
This Jurieu's handsome.
A pity the lady of the house...

546
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,595
Did you know
she seated him at her right?

547
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,895
- What right?
- At the table.

548
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,870
That's bad.
I'm all for doing as I like,

549
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:14,304
but etiquette is etiquette.

550
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:17,273
Madame can do without your advice.

551
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,540
Asparagus?
- Never anything canned.

552
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,911
Only fresh foods, for the vitamins.

553
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,220
Pass the mustard?

554
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:30,048
Did you get sea salt
for La Bruyère?

555
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:33,089
She can eat like everybody else.

556
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:36,627
Diets I can accept,
but not obsessions.

557
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,194
Madame's gone too far
over her aviator.

558
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:41,359
"Constraint spoils pleasure."

559
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:45,804
- And you, Mr. Corneille?
- None of your business.

560
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,407
That's not very nice.

561
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:49,008
Pass the mustard.

562
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,573
Corneille, you spent 10 years
with Count de Vaudois...

563
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,344
Twelve. I'd still be there
if he hadn't gone bankrupt.

564
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,587
- Fine, but did the countess...
- She had no lovers.

565
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:01,915
Of course not.

566
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,992
She was 85 years old
and confined to a wheelchair.

567
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:08,786
You can't compare her to Madame.

568
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:12,361
- The count wasn't a yid.
- Meaning what?

569
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:17,137
Only that La Chesnaye's grandfather
was a Rosenthal from Frankfurt.

570
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,933
I'm sure your husband agrees.

571
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:23,906
Right, Schumacher?

572
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:26,771
I don't know
what you're talking about.

573
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:31,682
Speaking of Jews, I used to work
for the Baron d'Epinay.

574
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,479
There were no Jews there,

575
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:36,550
but I can tell you
they ate like pigs.

576
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,556
That's why I quit.

577
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,321
- Will you be long, Lisette?
- Madame still needs me.

578
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:44,429
La Chesnaye, yid as he may be,

579
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,001
chewed me out recently
over a potato salad.

580
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,038
You know - or maybe you don't -
that for it to be any good,

581
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,334
you pour white wine
over the potatoes

582
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,069
when they're boiling hot.

583
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:59,646
But Célestin was afraid
of getting burned.

584
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,715
Well, the boss sensed
right off he hadn't done it.

585
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,720
Say what you like, but that's
what I call a real gentleman.

586
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:11,451
So there you are.

587
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,353
Who do we have here?

588
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:17,597
- I'm looking for Mr. Corneille.
- Yes, my friend?

589
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:22,465
I'm the new domestic.
His lordship must have told you.

590
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:24,538
What do you do, my good man?

591
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,968
Oh, I dunno...
a bit of everything.

592
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,873
- You shine shoes, my good man?
- Oh, sure.

593
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:35,278
When it comes to cleaning,
I'm what you call a specialist.

594
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:39,346
Tomorrow morning you'll collect
the boots outside the guest rooms.

595
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,783
Will do, Mr. Corneille.

596
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,581
We eat here?
- Yes, my good man.

597
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,420
I'm on duty now.

598
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:47,552
Sit down here.

599
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,691
Germaine, a plate.

600
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,694
What's your name?

601
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:54,597
Marceau. And you, mademoiselle?

602
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,331
Madame. My name's Lisette.
I'm Madame Schumacher.

603
00:40:00,142 --> 00:40:02,702
Don't let that stop you
from sitting down.

604
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,947
The game better be good.

605
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,413
Last year, at the Cahens,

606
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:12,917
we only bagged
60 pheasant the first day.

607
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:16,414
So long as I don't eat rabbit,
I don't care!

608
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:18,559
Anything but wild rabbit!

609
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:21,321
Do I serve rabbit other than paté?

610
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,259
I'm not saying you do.

611
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:26,195
Say, La Chesnaye,
enjoy driving your Delahaye?

612
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:28,966
Last month, Cannes-Paris:
10 hours and 35 minutes.

613
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:30,664
With a lunch stop.

614
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:35,133
<i>So it's all set.</i>

615
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,710
A party after the hunt.

616
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,540
- What party?
- Our party!

617
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:41,740
- A masquerade?
- Of course. Off to bed now.

618
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,279
I'll come check
you have everything you need.

619
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:50,823
As your guests,
we never lack for anything.

620
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,260
Such hospitality is dying out.

621
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:55,755
Christine,
you're the perfect hostess.

622
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,228
This way, General.

623
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:05,005
Before you go,
I was meaning to ask you...

624
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:07,767
What's this pre-Colombian art?
What are you studying?

625
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:10,707
American civilization
before Columbus's arrival.

626
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:14,610
- Oh, Negroes!
- There weren't any Negroes yet.

627
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:16,751
- Who was there?
- The Indians.

628
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:19,148
What a goose I am! Buffalo Bill!

629
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:30,326
- I forget where my room is.
- I'll show you.

630
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,696
We must have a splendid view.
Too bad it's dark.

631
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:37,805
A hunting horn!
You hunt on horseback?

632
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,304
In my father's day.

633
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,533
Is Octave too noisy?
- Not at all.

634
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,168
At the party,
I'll do a fencing demonstration.

635
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:47,247
I used to do a card trick.

636
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,509
Whatever you do will be fine.

637
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:53,013
- You're a great musician.
- Have fun.

638
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:59,093
William,
I won't be needing you tonight.

639
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:02,428
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

640
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:05,025
Good night. Sleep well.

641
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,565
You two happy?
- Very.

642
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:10,535
I adore you, Charlotte!

643
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:15,533
My dear, I'm so grateful to you.

644
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,702
- For what?
- For not making me look foolish.

645
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:21,714
It was delicate,
in front of everyone.

646
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:23,748
Jurieu handled it well too.

647
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:28,983
It was a trying moment, and you were
admirable. My compliments.

648
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,462
You can go now.
I won't be needing you now.

649
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:44,537
Oh, no?
Good night, Madame.

650
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:54,879
Don't you want children?

651
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,584
Sure I do, Madame.

652
00:42:56,852 --> 00:42:58,717
But they demand a lot of time.

653
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:01,947
You have to keep after them.
Or else why bother?

654
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:04,218
That's the beauty of it.

655
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:06,757
It's your sole preoccupation.

656
00:43:07,229 --> 00:43:10,596
Madame's heard about
the new servant? He's very nice.

657
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:12,560
His name's Marceau.

658
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,526
Watch out for your husband.
His name's Schumacher.

659
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:20,942
And Mr. Octave's friend's name
is André Jurieu.

660
00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:35,886
So my aviator's not all that bad.

661
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:38,853
You sure smell nice. Perfume?
- Leave me alone!

662
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:41,123
Something's cooking!

663
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,327
Not in bed yet?

664
00:43:51,873 --> 00:43:53,272
- So that's it.
- That's what?

665
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,098
It's working out. Happy?

666
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:58,041
Delighted. Now we can
put our cards on the table.

667
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:00,579
But you'd better hide your hand.

668
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:08,788
My good man, I hadn't heard
about that radio business.

669
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:13,385
It confirms my opinion
that our little Christine has class.

670
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,695
And that's a rare thing nowadays.

671
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:18,490
Sleep well, General.

672
00:44:23,104 --> 00:44:24,298
What do you say?

673
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:27,475
- About what?
- Everything. It's going well.

674
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,834
I'm getting the hell out.

675
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:32,741
Oh, no, not after
all the trouble I went to.

676
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:35,041
You're here, you stay.

677
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,877
Do you like pillows?
I can't stand 'em.

678
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:40,453
You finished bouncing around?

679
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:50,225
Sorry, Saint-Aubin.
I shouldn't have shot that pheasant.

680
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:52,958
I thought it was in my range,
but it was yours.

681
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:55,068
No, it was clearly yours.

682
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:59,367
- No, it was past the pine tree.
- It was yours, my dear fellow.

683
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,508
You're too kind.

684
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:02,870
You'll have the seventh blind.

685
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:06,237
It's a bit far,
but there are plenty of pheasant.

686
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:10,610
Saint-Aubin, you're his neighbor.
- The beaters come from where?

687
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:14,380
- From there.
- Then the game will come this way.

688
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:16,581
At least we'll be upwind.

689
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:20,592
Schumacher will show you
to your blinds.

690
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:24,290
- Madame de Marras?
- I know where.

691
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,326
Mr. Jurieu,
you can go up that way.

692
00:45:29,037 --> 00:45:32,006
You have to get some height
ahead of the beaters.

693
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:34,198
A lot of game
try to escape over the road.

694
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:38,235
- You coming with me?
- There?

695
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:41,473
They'll take us for rabbits.
- Don't be silly.

696
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:43,674
That's right, the last blind.

697
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:46,415
Happy being out here?

698
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:49,751
Very happy.
And far from the chatterers.

699
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:51,225
Say, Octave...

700
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:53,924
did you see Christine
with La Chesnaye?

701
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,356
- What'd they do now?
- Disgusting! They're overdoing it.

702
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,694
They have every right to.
They're married.

703
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:04,204
I hate her.

704
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,240
You're going through a rough time,

705
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,246
but you'll get over it.

706
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:16,882
Trust my experience.
It'll take a while, but you will.

707
00:46:17,686 --> 00:46:18,914
One morning you'll wake up

708
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:23,046
and you'll notice the concierge's
daughter has gorgeous eyes.

709
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:24,918
There, you're cured.

710
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,920
To wake up I have to fall asleep.
But I can't sleep!

711
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:33,965
So I've noticed.
You can really be a pain at night.

712
00:46:34,202 --> 00:46:35,464
Ready on the left?

713
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:37,797
Let's go.

714
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:46,140
Gentlemen, your positions!

715
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:51,249
Move it on the left.

716
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:54,513
Move ahead.

717
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:57,450
Stay close.

718
00:46:58,393 --> 00:46:59,655
Flush 'em out.

719
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:07,818
- Jackie, do you enjoy hunting?
- Yes, Aunt. Don't you?

720
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:19,659
I missed them all.
I'm a poor shot today.

721
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:23,965
- You two were talking too much.
- Anyway, I'm sick of hunting.

722
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:27,108
Simple enough.
We'll take up winter sports.

723
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:29,244
Shall we display the kill?

724
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:31,572
No. Do that at the château.

725
00:50:35,517 --> 00:50:38,452
That pheasant there on the left...

726
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,214
Sorry, sir, but this time it's mine.

727
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,881
You can't keep pulling this.

728
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:46,084
Last time I didn't complain.

729
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,552
Try to understand.

730
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,028
I get a bead on a pheasant,

731
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,861
and bang!
He shoots it down in front of me!

732
00:50:54,036 --> 00:50:55,333
That's a bit rich!

733
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:59,003
They have a fine sport
in Austria: Hunting woodcock.

734
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:00,573
- At night?
- At dawn.

735
00:51:00,742 --> 00:51:03,643
- I have something to tell you.
- Go ahead.

736
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:06,406
It's a secret.
May I borrow him, General?

737
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:09,144
- If you give him back.
- Have no fear.

738
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:13,812
None of that, Saint-Aubin.

739
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,090
Some people are really clumsy
with their guns.

740
00:51:20,028 --> 00:51:23,987
Know what happened to poor George
last year at the Malvoisies?

741
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,192
He took his gun from his loader
in such a way

742
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:30,202
that he blasted his thigh to pieces.

743
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,767
He was dead in 20 minutes.

744
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:35,805
Wasn't that a good one, Christine?

745
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:40,438
Deyeux said, "Your day is done
with game bag full and empty gun."

746
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,944
- Jackie, it's yours!
- Where? I can't see a thing!

747
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:47,520
But where?
- There! Aim at the rabbit, not me.

748
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:50,358
We lost him.

749
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,994
You're the most
deliciously clumsy of women.

750
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:55,129
Am I?

751
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:58,265
- You are.
- I wish I were even clumsier.

752
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,797
- Why?
- So you'd kiss me more often.

753
00:52:01,737 --> 00:52:02,726
Easy enough.

754
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:07,703
You know, Jackie...

755
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:10,405
I don't love you.

756
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,008
I know.

757
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:14,173
But you're wasting
your time with my aunt.

758
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:16,910
So you know.

759
00:52:17,085 --> 00:52:20,077
It's no joke.
You're in pain and so am I.

760
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:25,122
The field master was lousy.

761
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,124
Mr. André shot poorly.

762
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:30,059
His lordship is a better shot.

763
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:31,631
You finished, kids?

764
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:39,401
I had no luck despite my position.

765
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:40,970
It can happen.

766
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:43,609
- Are you cold, Madame?
- Not when I walk.

767
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:46,839
When the sun goes down,
the temperatures plummet.

768
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:48,438
A squirrel!

769
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,208
If I only had my gun...

770
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:54,515
- Why? I'm fond of squirrels.
- They're charming but destructive.

771
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:55,745
Take a look.

772
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:00,261
How marvelous!

773
00:53:01,396 --> 00:53:03,557
It looks so close
I could almost touch it.

774
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:06,825
Field glasses always come in handy.

775
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,096
This one's small enough to carry.

776
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:12,869
Their lenses are so fine
and their shape so practical

777
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:15,305
that at a short distance

778
00:53:15,477 --> 00:53:19,846
you can watch that squirrel up close
without frightening it.

779
00:53:21,183 --> 00:53:23,845
Fine. So you'll tell
Christine everything.

780
00:53:24,086 --> 00:53:26,111
To what end?
- To hurt you.

781
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:27,444
Charming of you!

782
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:31,353
I hate suffering alone.
Misery loves company.

783
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:35,359
I want to see your face
when Christine leaves you.

784
00:53:36,164 --> 00:53:37,995
And she will if I tell her.

785
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,066
I don't doubt it.

786
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:42,060
You really love her.

787
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:46,099
You've stopped loving me?
- Let's change the subject.

788
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:50,370
I'm like the shepherd Paris
without the apple. It's grotesque.

789
00:53:50,612 --> 00:53:52,239
Please give me an answer.

790
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,809
No, I don't love you anymore.

791
00:53:54,983 --> 00:53:57,884
I'm very fond of you, but...

792
00:53:58,253 --> 00:53:59,220
But I bore you.

793
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:02,015
The words you come up with, my dear.

794
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,487
The right ones.

795
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:11,064
I give up. You can fight hatred,
but not boredom.

796
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:19,163
Well, the whole thing's
getting to me, too.

797
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,840
Seeing you play shepherd
to your Viennese shepherdess

798
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:24,837
makes me want to yawn.

799
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:28,916
I'm leaving.
- That would be best.

800
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:31,650
Yes, I'm leaving.

801
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:35,019
But bid me a tender farewell.

802
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,090
Not farewell. Good-bye.

803
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:38,783
No, farewell.

804
00:54:39,628 --> 00:54:41,493
But a beautiful farewell.

805
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,794
For a moment, I want to go back
three years in time.

806
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:49,327
When Christine didn't exist.

807
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:53,630
Take me in your arms as you did then.

808
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:56,676
I'll close my eyes

809
00:54:58,146 --> 00:55:00,876
and believe in everything
I could desire.

810
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:02,016
Come now, Geneviève.

811
00:55:02,184 --> 00:55:03,879
Don't say a thing.

812
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,845
Kiss me.
- My dear...

813
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,657
Extraordinary!

814
00:55:17,098 --> 00:55:19,931
A moorhen!
You could count its feathers.

815
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,569
- Still see it?
- No.

816
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,638
Here, Madame.
Two feet away from the tree.

817
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:28,101
Three if we use your feet.

818
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:30,634
I want to see it, too.

819
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:31,904
Isn't it sweet!

820
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,340
Let me see.

821
00:55:33,682 --> 00:55:34,944
It's my turn.

822
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:47,553
Whatever you're looking at
seems damn interesting.

823
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,265
Very interesting.

824
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,464
'Morning, your ladyship.

825
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,584
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I am.

826
00:56:16,157 --> 00:56:19,422
- Not staying for our party?
- I'm expected in Paris.

827
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:23,960
- You can phone.
- No, it's better if I go.

828
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,267
Better?

829
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,094
For whom?

830
00:56:28,837 --> 00:56:29,895
For you?

831
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:32,637
For me, then?

832
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,107
My dear Geneviève,

833
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,337
can we speak frankly?

834
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:44,943
Am I a troublesome wife?

835
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,479
How could you be
troublesome to me?

836
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:58,194
Have I ever tried to hinder
your relationship with my husband?

837
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:01,027
You know?

838
00:57:01,403 --> 00:57:02,802
Like everyone else.

839
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,865
Good old Robert.
He's so kind, so sensitive.

840
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:12,343
But he's like a child.
He's incapable of hiding a thing.

841
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:13,672
How true.

842
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:16,749
When he tries to lie,
you can tell right away.

843
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:18,977
He blushes before speaking.

844
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:20,820
His nose almost starts growing.

845
00:57:21,323 --> 00:57:22,620
He has such tact.

846
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:28,991
I only have one complaint:
His habit of smoking in bed.

847
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,323
Isn't it awful, though!
And the ashes!

848
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:32,466
- The sheets!
- All burnt!

849
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:34,659
- The holes!
- As if beds were for smoking!

850
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:36,303
I ask you.

851
00:57:39,174 --> 00:57:41,199
So you'll stay?

852
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,143
I don't know anymore.

853
00:57:45,513 --> 00:57:49,415
Women should help each other out
once in a while.

854
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:52,483
If you stay,
my husband will look after you

855
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,486
and a little less after me,

856
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,954
which would suit me fine
right now.

857
00:57:58,593 --> 00:57:59,355
André Jurieu?

858
00:58:00,996 --> 00:58:03,487
André's very kind and very decent,

859
00:58:04,532 --> 00:58:07,933
but too sincere.
Sincere people are such bores.

860
00:58:08,303 --> 00:58:09,827
It depends what for.

861
00:58:10,538 --> 00:58:12,438
What will you wear tonight?

862
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:15,169
A Tyrolian outfit. And you?

863
00:58:15,343 --> 00:58:17,436
I didn't prepare anything.

864
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:21,739
Come with me.
We'll find some fabric.

865
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:25,251
Do you know any Tyrolian dances?

866
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,581
Wait, it must go like this.

867
00:58:30,225 --> 00:58:31,283
No, like this.

868
00:58:36,197 --> 00:58:38,324
Unbelievable!
Our shoes have vanished.

869
00:58:42,504 --> 00:58:45,166
- My boots are missing.
- So are mine.

870
00:58:45,774 --> 00:58:47,605
My wife's shoes are gone.

871
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:50,939
- Corneille will find them.
- I'll see to it.

872
00:58:52,347 --> 00:58:54,076
What will you wear tonight?

873
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:56,079
I thought it over all night.

874
00:58:56,718 --> 00:58:59,278
I'm going to dress as a bear.

875
00:59:06,694 --> 00:59:08,753
Wait. I left the price tag on.

876
00:59:09,764 --> 00:59:12,790
It's a fine cape.
Warm and waterproof.

877
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:15,333
But it's not flattering.

878
00:59:22,544 --> 00:59:26,810
"Some men require not
reputation's yoke.

879
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:30,974
Their first sword's thrust
can be the master stroke.

880
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,249
The eye was in the grave
and was watching Cain."

881
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:43,688
Getting used to your new job?

882
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,264
She loves me.

883
00:59:46,434 --> 00:59:47,264
Loves me not.

884
00:59:47,435 --> 00:59:48,197
Loves me.

885
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:49,393
Loves me not.

886
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:50,731
Loves me.

887
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:52,901
Loves me.

888
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:54,063
Loves me not.

889
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,004
Loves me.

890
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,200
Loves me not.

891
00:59:56,377 --> 00:59:57,605
Loves me.

892
00:59:58,446 --> 00:59:59,811
She loves me.

893
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:44,391
I hurt you.

894
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,390
- On the contrary. I'm glad.
- Why?

895
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:51,264
- You're close to me.
- Silly.

896
01:00:58,706 --> 01:01:02,472
Leave us alone or I'll tell Madame
and you'll be fired!

897
01:01:02,744 --> 01:01:05,440
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on duty.

898
01:01:05,613 --> 01:01:07,046
We're on duty.

899
01:01:08,216 --> 01:01:10,446
The boots, my good man!

900
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:13,917
All the men are waiting.
There's a house revolution!

901
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:17,315
Don't blame me.
Blame this big bully here.

902
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:20,790
- Why are you here?
- I came to see my wife.

903
01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:25,490
This is hardly the moment.
Their party's tonight. Off you go.

904
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:30,934
I catch you with her again,
I'll fill you full of lead!

905
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:36,335
Stop bothering the staff.
We're busy enough as it is.

906
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:38,741
See? You're bothering the staff.

907
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:23,347
We're a hit.

908
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:25,159
Encore.

909
01:02:29,097 --> 01:02:30,962
She's so annoying! Come on...

910
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:38,869
Author!

911
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:56,418
<i>Feeling gay
we proudly made our way</i>

912
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:59,822
<i>Out to the racetrack
our hearts unafraid</i>

913
01:03:00,094 --> 01:03:03,120
<i>Our step was brisk
We couldn't risk</i>

914
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:06,461
<i>Missing the military parade</i>

915
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,807
All together now!

916
01:03:42,337 --> 01:03:43,235
Where'd she go?

917
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:44,462
We must talk!

918
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:46,000
- Where is she?
- Who?

919
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,438
- Christine.
- Dunno. Help me out of this.

920
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,704
Berthelin.
- Don't bother me now.

921
01:05:18,866 --> 01:05:21,357
I drank too much.
I don't know what I'm doing.

922
01:05:21,536 --> 01:05:22,730
That's good.

923
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:05,643
- Aren't we playing anymore?
- I've had enough of this show.

924
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:08,738
Why'd I dress up like this, then?

925
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:12,010
Help me out of this bearskin.
- We're busy.

926
01:06:12,186 --> 01:06:13,175
Busy!

927
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:20,724
- Help me out of this.
- I'm busy.

928
01:06:21,262 --> 01:06:22,991
Have you seen my wife?

929
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:24,423
I'm looking for her.

930
01:06:40,214 --> 01:06:43,479
For Christ's sake,
who'll help me out of this skin?

931
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:46,620
- I'm dying to play belote.
- A two-hander?

932
01:06:52,193 --> 01:06:54,127
Ask the general.

933
01:06:57,832 --> 01:06:58,992
Have you seen Madame?

934
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:07,540
I don't mean to be a nuisance,
but I can't manage.

935
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,675
You're a nice fellow, but...

936
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:13,837
- But I can't take it off by myself!
- Now's not the time.

937
01:07:14,015 --> 01:07:16,313
And Christine?
What've you done with her?

938
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:18,551
You'll find out soon enough.

939
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:23,849
Let me just get this off.
Then they'll see!

940
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,328
Come here.
I'll take your bearskin off.

941
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,694
About time!

942
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:46,076
If she still loved you,
she wouldn't be with Saint-Aubin.

943
01:07:46,247 --> 01:07:48,545
Let's leave together.

944
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,640
I live here.
I can't just walk out.

945
01:07:50,785 --> 01:07:53,219
You and your sense of property!

946
01:07:53,387 --> 01:07:55,651
As if a house were that important!

947
01:07:57,058 --> 01:07:58,582
I must see Christine first.

948
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,027
Pull!

949
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:16,304
- You haven't seen me.
- Why?

950
01:08:16,477 --> 01:08:18,809
- Schumacher's after me.
- What for?

951
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,141
On account of his wife.

952
01:08:21,549 --> 01:08:25,076
We were playing around.
He saw us and he's not happy.

953
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,480
Oh, your lordship...

954
01:08:27,955 --> 01:08:30,651
women are charming.
I like them a lot.

955
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:34,685
Too much, in fact.
But they spell trouble.

956
01:08:34,795 --> 01:08:36,023
You're telling me.

957
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,155
- You've got it bad, too?
- Somewhat.

958
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:41,131
Ever wish you were an Arab?

959
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:44,533
- No. What for?
- For the harem.

960
01:08:45,906 --> 01:08:48,568
Only Muslims show a little logic

961
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:51,073
in matters of male-female relations.

962
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,610
They're made like us.
- If you say so.

963
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:56,181
They always have a favorite.

964
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,683
But they don't kick the others out
and hurt their feelings.

965
01:08:59,854 --> 01:09:00,878
If you say so.

966
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:05,219
I don't want to hurt anyone,
especially not a woman.

967
01:09:06,627 --> 01:09:09,790
It's the story of my life.
- But that takes money.

968
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:12,691
Even with money,
I still hurt everybody:

969
01:09:12,867 --> 01:09:15,233
My wife, my mistress
and even myself.

970
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,266
Whether it's to have a woman,
leave her or hold on to her,

971
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:22,068
first I make her laugh.

972
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:26,107
That way, her guard's down
and you have your way with her.

973
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,147
Why don't you give it a try?

974
01:09:29,483 --> 01:09:31,508
Because it takes talent.

975
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,587
Naturally.

976
01:09:33,954 --> 01:09:37,515
Would you mind doing me a favor?
- Gladly. What?

977
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:40,217
Check if the coast is clear.

978
01:09:40,428 --> 01:09:43,886
If Schumacher's not at this end,
I'll slip out the kitchen.

979
01:09:44,665 --> 01:09:46,895
- Use the terrace.
- Too much light.

980
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:50,060
- Stay here. I'll take a look.
- Thanks, your lordship.

981
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:06,579
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

982
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:09,890
You're restricted
to the hallways tonight.

983
01:10:10,057 --> 01:10:11,615
Move into my bathroom!

984
01:10:12,493 --> 01:10:13,357
You're needed.

985
01:10:13,527 --> 01:10:14,721
- Is it time?
- Just about.

986
01:10:14,929 --> 01:10:17,420
Where's Mr. Saint-Aubin?

987
01:10:17,598 --> 01:10:19,862
I don't know, honestly.

988
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,063
Excuse me!

989
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:31,445
Where's André?

990
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:36,508
You realize I've been looking for you
for the past half hour?

991
01:10:36,684 --> 01:10:38,948
By what right?

992
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,781
Yes, by what right?

993
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,288
You're being indiscreet.

994
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:46,790
Maybe so, but this time
I demand an explanation.

995
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:48,461
I refuse to give one.

996
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,564
- You can't order Christine around.
- Then you'll give me one.

997
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:55,531
I'll box your ears, sir.
- Just try, sir.

998
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:57,298
André, please!

999
01:10:57,872 --> 01:10:59,533
My dear Christine, I'm sorry.

1000
01:10:59,707 --> 01:11:01,834
He'll receive my seconds
in the morning.

1001
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:05,240
Mornings, I sleep.
I may have to throw them out.

1002
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:07,437
- You won't duel?
- Not with you.

1003
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:09,742
- You won't live it down.
- That's a laugh.

1004
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:13,944
In my opinion,
you're a most contemptible coward.

1005
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:21,393
You're putting me
in an inferior position.

1006
01:11:21,595 --> 01:11:22,755
You mustn't fight.

1007
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:26,195
I'm going to break that clown's neck.

1008
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,264
Clown?

1009
01:11:30,337 --> 01:11:32,305
Stay out of this.

1010
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,177
So I'm a coward?

1011
01:11:59,533 --> 01:12:00,557
See to Saint-Aubin.

1012
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,902
Why weren't you at Le Bourget?

1013
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:10,041
Because...

1014
01:12:11,378 --> 01:12:12,640
I love you, André.

1015
01:12:13,681 --> 01:12:15,615
I never wanted to admit it.

1016
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,942
But now I have a right to tell you.

1017
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:21,086
I love you.

1018
01:12:22,323 --> 01:12:23,381
This is wonderful.

1019
01:12:26,327 --> 01:12:27,419
I'd given up hope.

1020
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:32,295
What are we going to do?

1021
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,797
We'll go away.

1022
01:12:34,969 --> 01:12:36,732
- Where?
- Anywhere.

1023
01:12:37,071 --> 01:12:38,971
- When?
- Right away.

1024
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,607
I love you, Christine.

1025
01:12:43,677 --> 01:12:45,440
I think I can make you happy.

1026
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:49,541
I've dreamed only
of the joy of being with you.

1027
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:55,377
So I know...
this joy doesn't come as a surprise.

1028
01:12:56,891 --> 01:12:58,222
Are you afraid?

1029
01:13:02,162 --> 01:13:03,686
I must tell La Chesnaye.

1030
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:05,560
What for?

1031
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:07,696
It's only proper that I do.

1032
01:13:14,441 --> 01:13:15,669
Listen to me.

1033
01:13:16,944 --> 01:13:19,777
I can't run off
with the wife of a host

1034
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,847
who calls me friend
and shakes my hand

1035
01:13:23,017 --> 01:13:24,917
without an explanation.

1036
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:29,044
But since we're in love,
what difference can it make?

1037
01:13:29,223 --> 01:13:31,657
Even so, Christine,
there are still rules.

1038
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:43,165
<i>We went and kicked up our heels</i>

1039
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:46,898
<i>Without drum or fife
we looked for thrills in life</i>

1040
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:51,033
<i>We went and kicked up our heels</i>

1041
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:54,669
<i>Though we each have a wife
we kicked up our heels</i>

1042
01:14:14,234 --> 01:14:18,830
Dear friends, I have the pleasure
of showing you my latest acquisition.

1043
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:21,403
It's the high point of my career

1044
01:14:21,575 --> 01:14:24,738
as a collector of musical
and mechanical instruments.

1045
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:28,346
I think you'll like it.
I'll let you decide.

1046
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:29,712
One...

1047
01:14:32,286 --> 01:14:33,184
Two...

1048
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:35,381
Music!

1049
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:21,865
If he bothers you,
come and get me.

1050
01:15:22,036 --> 01:15:25,164
I'll put him in his place, and fast.

1051
01:15:37,317 --> 01:15:40,548
- What are you doing here?
- I came down for an apple.

1052
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:44,755
- Where's Marceau?
- Am I his keeper?

1053
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,959
- Where you going?
- Upstairs with the others.

1054
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:51,430
Get me a drink.

1055
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,590
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and you're coming with me.

1056
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:27,525
Whatever you say, Edouard.

1057
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:29,699
I'll take you to Alsace.

1058
01:16:30,404 --> 01:16:35,000
Poachers, crooks, the likes of
Marceau we know how to handle.

1059
01:16:35,609 --> 01:16:37,042
A squeeze of the trigger

1060
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:39,509
one night in the woods,
and that's settled.

1061
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,908
Of course.

1062
01:16:41,748 --> 01:16:43,409
To hell with their money.

1063
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:48,317
It's stupid to work for others
when you can be your own master.

1064
01:16:48,489 --> 01:16:50,957
And Alsace must be so beautiful,

1065
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:55,289
with all those tall fir trees,
all that snow, and the storks.

1066
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:24,714
Stop it! Do you hear me?

1067
01:17:25,692 --> 01:17:26,659
Let go!

1068
01:17:26,827 --> 01:17:27,816
Let go, Lisette!

1069
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:30,994
For the last time!

1070
01:17:32,266 --> 01:17:35,429
Do you hear me?
I won't say it again!

1071
01:17:35,636 --> 01:17:39,766
No, André, I'll leave with you
right now or never.

1072
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:42,465
We must walk out
with our heads high.

1073
01:17:42,643 --> 01:17:44,167
You'll thank me later.

1074
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,045
Sorry, Madame.

1075
01:17:47,814 --> 01:17:49,372
I'll murder you!

1076
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,379
Well, now...

1077
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:57,223
Mr. Jurieu.

1078
01:17:58,058 --> 01:17:59,855
You have what you wanted.

1079
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,887
You're stealing my wife.
- No, just give me five minutes.

1080
01:18:04,064 --> 01:18:05,793
I'll give you this, bastard!

1081
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:09,934
Repeat that?

1082
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:12,464
What's going on?

1083
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:15,131
Let's get out of here.

1084
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:17,008
Hold on!

1085
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:21,836
Thief!

1086
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:25,612
Are you crazy?

1087
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,783
- I've had enough!
- What is it?

1088
01:18:28,956 --> 01:18:31,516
I just told your friend
that I love him.

1089
01:18:31,692 --> 01:18:33,284
Well, it's about time!

1090
01:18:33,594 --> 01:18:34,856
You really love him?

1091
01:18:35,028 --> 01:18:36,359
I don't know anymore.

1092
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:38,328
Already? What'd he do to you?

1093
01:18:38,432 --> 01:18:40,957
He kept talking... about propriety.

1094
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:44,695
He suggested that I spend a month
with his mother in the country

1095
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:47,169
while he settled things
with La Chesnaye.

1096
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:48,901
What did you expect?

1097
01:18:49,009 --> 01:18:53,207
That he'd take me in his arms,
kiss me and take me away.

1098
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,677
Poor little Christine.

1099
01:18:55,015 --> 01:18:58,382
There's one thing you forget:
You see, he's a hero.

1100
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:05,447
- I'll have his hide!
- You're crazy!

1101
01:19:08,362 --> 01:19:10,887
I've had it!
I'll break your neck!

1102
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,101
- Was that a bullet?
- A bullet.

1103
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,067
- From a gun?
- From a gun.

1104
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:21,366
A bullet from a gun.
Does that surprise you?

1105
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,475
- Christine disappeared.
- Christine disappeared!

1106
01:19:25,712 --> 01:19:27,646
Tonight...
Christine disappeared!

1107
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:30,280
So it goes!

1108
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:33,851
You fools! Didn't you see her
leave with Octave?

1109
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:38,914
I don't blame her.
If you two think you're any fun!

1110
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:41,950
Don't worry.
You'll find her someday.

1111
01:19:42,129 --> 01:19:43,221
Geneviève, please!

1112
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,068
And now, darling,
let's talk about the two of us.

1113
01:19:52,072 --> 01:19:53,539
When are we leaving?

1114
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,475
This isn't the moment!

1115
01:19:56,743 --> 01:19:58,108
I have other worries!

1116
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:02,305
<i>Your father walked by
without even a look.</i>

1117
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:06,377
<i>And we hid behind a door.</i>

1118
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:11,049
The musicians were already
on their feet.

1119
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:14,920
And out there,
the audience was applauding.

1120
01:20:15,095 --> 01:20:17,689
- The old atmosphere!
- Sure was.

1121
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,757
The setting was strange.

1122
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:25,000
It was meant to look
like a parlor in green and gold.

1123
01:20:25,172 --> 01:20:29,700
The kind of green
only the English can come up with.

1124
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:33,068
And your father... what elegance!

1125
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,240
He crossed the stage,
oblivious to everything.

1126
01:20:39,953 --> 01:20:41,648
The house went wild.

1127
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,352
The king here...

1128
01:20:45,726 --> 01:20:47,125
As hard as he could.

1129
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:52,297
He took his baton
from the first violin.

1130
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:54,434
As usual.

1131
01:20:56,203 --> 01:20:58,034
And just like in a dream...

1132
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,458
Leave me alone.

1133
01:22:01,201 --> 01:22:02,190
You dirty louse!

1134
01:22:05,105 --> 01:22:05,969
Let go!

1135
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:09,131
Not another attraction?
This is too much.

1136
01:22:09,643 --> 01:22:11,873
- Enough is enough.
- I hate gunshots.

1137
01:22:12,078 --> 01:22:13,909
That will do, Schumacher!

1138
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,479
- Get off my back!
- What?

1139
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:28,622
André, please help me
calm her down.

1140
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,398
Corneille, put an end to this farce!

1141
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:40,301
- Which one, your lordship?
- Schumacher and company!

1142
01:22:40,474 --> 01:22:41,441
Right away.

1143
01:23:34,261 --> 01:23:35,853
You were standing here?

1144
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:38,562
Yes, Madame.
And I have to thank you.

1145
01:23:39,533 --> 01:23:41,194
Thank you.
- Don't mention it!

1146
01:23:44,304 --> 01:23:45,703
- What's the dose?
- Two.

1147
01:23:45,872 --> 01:23:46,861
Give me four.

1148
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,936
Sleeping pills?
I hate sleeping pills!

1149
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:52,135
Be reasonable.

1150
01:23:52,312 --> 01:23:55,076
Where are you going?
- To dance!

1151
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:59,844
- You can dance in bed.
- Yes, my love. I'm going to bed.

1152
01:24:00,186 --> 01:24:02,677
Yes, darling, I'm going to bed.

1153
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:05,453
You really need it.

1154
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,123
Go back to your room.

1155
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:11,720
I'm asking you, go back inside.

1156
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:14,992
Calm down, my dear.
We'll see each other tomorrow.

1157
01:24:15,902 --> 01:24:16,869
Good night.

1158
01:24:17,737 --> 01:24:18,726
The general!

1159
01:24:24,277 --> 01:24:25,335
Cigarette?

1160
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:28,238
Turning in so soon, General?

1161
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:30,609
Yes, I'm turning in.

1162
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:35,417
I wanted to pay my respects
to Christine. Where is she?

1163
01:24:35,589 --> 01:24:36,521
A headache.

1164
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:40,126
- Turning in because of that incident?
- Not at all.

1165
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:42,557
- A slight dispute.
- Of course. Good night.

1166
01:24:43,296 --> 01:24:45,423
Where's Christine?
Something must be wrong.

1167
01:24:46,066 --> 01:24:47,658
She was tired and turned in.

1168
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:52,294
- Really? And Geneviève?
- A bit weary, that's all.

1169
01:24:52,472 --> 01:24:53,700
She's so sensitive.

1170
01:24:53,873 --> 01:24:56,842
The staff was a bit excited tonight.

1171
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:59,034
They're entitled to some fun, too.

1172
01:24:59,212 --> 01:25:00,702
We thought it was an act.

1173
01:25:00,914 --> 01:25:03,849
Had I known,
I would have stopped him.

1174
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:06,281
It's all right. Sleep well.

1175
01:25:06,453 --> 01:25:08,318
My respects to your wife.

1176
01:25:08,488 --> 01:25:10,080
Kiss her for me.

1177
01:25:10,256 --> 01:25:12,417
Going already?
It's early yet.

1178
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:17,256
If Christine has the flu,
try a footbath with mustard flour.

1179
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:20,061
- Can't we see Christine?
- She's resting.

1180
01:25:20,233 --> 01:25:24,727
Great evening! This would have been
impossible in Tourcoing.

1181
01:25:24,938 --> 01:25:28,669
We once danced a farandole.
Charming, but so old-fashioned.

1182
01:25:28,842 --> 01:25:30,400
Of course. Good night.

1183
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,411
Just a minute.

1184
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:39,411
Was there a lot of damage?
Was anyone injured?

1185
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:43,384
I just did an inspection.
None of the guests were hurt.

1186
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:47,356
The stuffed birds suffered a bit,
and I found a bullet in a door.

1187
01:25:47,527 --> 01:25:49,791
Not to mention the glassware.

1188
01:25:49,963 --> 01:25:52,591
I have no choice but to dismiss you.

1189
01:25:53,033 --> 01:25:56,867
It breaks my heart, but I can't
expose my guests to your firearms.

1190
01:25:57,037 --> 01:26:00,063
It may be wrong of them,
but they value their lives.

1191
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:01,972
When must I leave?

1192
01:26:02,142 --> 01:26:04,372
Straightaway. At once.

1193
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:06,340
Corneille will pay you
some compensation.

1194
01:26:06,446 --> 01:26:08,437
I never want
to hear your name again.

1195
01:26:09,449 --> 01:26:12,111
- You're coming with me?
- I'm going to Madame.

1196
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:13,445
To say good-bye to her?

1197
01:26:13,787 --> 01:26:17,780
I told you before! If Madame
still wants me, I'm staying.

1198
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:26,021
- Isn't it excessive?
- Do as I say.

1199
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:26,893
Very well.

1200
01:26:27,067 --> 01:26:28,034
Come with me.

1201
01:26:35,475 --> 01:26:38,672
My good man,
I have to ask you to leave, too.

1202
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:42,440
I can't dismiss Schumacher
and leave you here with his wife.

1203
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,549
It'd be immoral, you understand?

1204
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:47,151
I understand.
No hard feelings.

1205
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:51,988
Before I go,
I want to tell you how grateful I am.

1206
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:55,690
You tried to help me up
by making me a domestic.

1207
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:58,123
I'll never forget that.

1208
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:02,394
Don't try to soften me up. Just go.
I've enough troubles as it is.

1209
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:07,934
What a night!

1210
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:13,311
Where were we?
- I asked you for five minutes.

1211
01:27:13,513 --> 01:27:14,878
Granted.

1212
01:27:15,048 --> 01:27:17,949
How good of you.
But you have quite a right hook.

1213
01:27:18,118 --> 01:27:19,107
You're too kind.

1214
01:27:20,954 --> 01:27:24,048
Where can we talk?
- In the dining room.

1215
01:27:24,724 --> 01:27:26,123
Yes, of course.

1216
01:27:28,695 --> 01:27:32,028
But first, accept my apologies.
- You don't have to...

1217
01:27:32,198 --> 01:27:35,326
You must.
I behaved like a real roughneck.

1218
01:27:35,435 --> 01:27:36,595
I was no better.

1219
01:27:36,703 --> 01:27:40,469
Know what our little athletic
display reminded me of?

1220
01:27:40,907 --> 01:27:43,671
I sometimes read articles
in the papers

1221
01:27:43,843 --> 01:27:48,439
about some Italian roadworker trying
to seduce a Polish laborer's wife.

1222
01:27:48,615 --> 01:27:49,946
It ends in a stabbing.

1223
01:27:50,116 --> 01:27:53,847
I never believed
such things happened. But they do!

1224
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,009
I have an excuse.

1225
01:27:55,822 --> 01:27:57,847
I love Christine.
- And I don't?

1226
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:00,883
I love her so much
I want her to leave with you.

1227
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:03,221
Since her happiness depends on it.

1228
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:06,999
But I'm glad it's with someone
from our set.

1229
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:08,864
But still...

1230
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:11,434
something bothers me.

1231
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:13,162
- What?
- Your profession.

1232
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:16,399
- What about it?
- Christine has a certain lifestyle.

1233
01:28:16,576 --> 01:28:20,171
You're young and famous.
You could have an accident.

1234
01:28:20,346 --> 01:28:22,746
- What optimism!
- One has to consider it.

1235
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,510
What would
your financial situation be?

1236
01:28:39,499 --> 01:28:42,059
What peace after all that noise.

1237
01:28:42,602 --> 01:28:44,866
Are they all gone?
- Looks like it.

1238
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:46,460
Good.

1239
01:28:48,341 --> 01:28:50,366
I must talk to you
about André again.

1240
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:55,438
You have to understand.
It's the plight of all heroes today.

1241
01:28:55,615 --> 01:28:58,413
In the air, they're terrific.

1242
01:28:58,585 --> 01:29:02,521
But when they come back to earth,
they're weak, poor and helpless.

1243
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:04,247
Clumsy as children.

1244
01:29:04,424 --> 01:29:06,153
They can cross the Atlantic,

1245
01:29:06,326 --> 01:29:10,922
but not the Champs-Elysées
outside the crosswalk.

1246
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:12,462
That's how they are.

1247
01:29:12,632 --> 01:29:14,759
Look at the moon with its halo.

1248
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:16,697
It will rain tomorrow.

1249
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:21,539
I was looking for you.
I was worried.

1250
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:22,897
Why?

1251
01:29:23,343 --> 01:29:25,811
- You're not mad at me?
- Not at all.

1252
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:29,008
It's not our fault
if men are all mad.

1253
01:29:29,716 --> 01:29:32,207
- So I can stay?
- Of course.

1254
01:29:32,585 --> 01:29:33,847
I'm so happy!

1255
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:35,549
Come inside.

1256
01:29:35,722 --> 01:29:39,123
You can't be out like this
on a November night.

1257
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:42,327
You knew about Mme. De Marras
and my husband?

1258
01:29:43,363 --> 01:29:48,062
But it began before your marriage.
At a summer resort.

1259
01:29:48,268 --> 01:29:52,398
You see? Everybody knew.
And you never said a word.

1260
01:29:52,605 --> 01:29:54,732
- We didn't want to hurt you.
- Obviously.

1261
01:29:54,941 --> 01:29:58,934
For the last three years,
my life's been built on a lie.

1262
01:29:59,913 --> 01:30:03,872
It's been on my mind
since I saw them at the hunt.

1263
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:06,944
And suddenly I understood.

1264
01:30:07,654 --> 01:30:09,918
That's also part of the times.

1265
01:30:10,089 --> 01:30:11,954
Today everyone lies.

1266
01:30:12,425 --> 01:30:15,360
Pharmaceutical fliers, governments,

1267
01:30:15,528 --> 01:30:17,928
the radio, the movies,
the newspapers.

1268
01:30:18,097 --> 01:30:22,397
So why shouldn't simple people
like us lie as well?

1269
01:30:23,436 --> 01:30:24,994
Let's go for a walk.

1270
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:26,999
- I'll get your coat.
- I'm too warm.

1271
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,934
That's because you're not well.
Take my cape.

1272
01:30:38,217 --> 01:30:40,981
It's not very fancy,
but you won't catch cold.

1273
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:08,235
You up the creek?

1274
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:12,306
So am I.

1275
01:31:13,453 --> 01:31:14,852
Did you see her again?

1276
01:31:16,022 --> 01:31:17,046
Me neither.

1277
01:31:17,857 --> 01:31:20,257
She said she'd stay with Madame.

1278
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,886
With Madame!

1279
01:31:22,428 --> 01:31:25,056
She's not married to you,
but to Madame.

1280
01:31:33,506 --> 01:31:34,666
What'll you do now?

1281
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:41,579
I'll go back to my little cabin
and get back to work.

1282
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:44,113
Back to your poaching?

1283
01:31:45,318 --> 01:31:49,618
What's it to you,
now that he threw you out?

1284
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:54,757
You must have poached
a few pheasant yourself.

1285
01:31:56,362 --> 01:31:57,386
A few rabbits.

1286
01:31:59,165 --> 01:32:00,894
I have an idea.

1287
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,228
I'm gonna get myself
a license as a game dealer.

1288
01:32:04,404 --> 01:32:06,998
If a cop stops me -
"What've you got there?"

1289
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:10,036
I say, "In my basket?
Ten wild rabbits,

1290
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:13,508
which I have a license to sell.

1291
01:32:13,713 --> 01:32:15,203
Good day, Officer."

1292
01:32:15,381 --> 01:32:17,042
Have a cigarette.

1293
01:32:19,919 --> 01:32:20,886
And you?

1294
01:32:22,655 --> 01:32:23,849
What'll you do now?

1295
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:26,154
I'll stay in the area.

1296
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:28,418
Because of my wife.

1297
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:30,928
I want her back.

1298
01:32:40,006 --> 01:32:41,974
- What are you doing?
- Spitting in the water.

1299
01:32:42,075 --> 01:32:44,134
It's all I know how to do in life.

1300
01:32:45,578 --> 01:32:46,772
Come now.

1301
01:32:47,747 --> 01:32:49,510
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1302
01:32:49,749 --> 01:32:53,048
It's just unpleasant to be reminded

1303
01:32:53,519 --> 01:32:55,384
what a failure I am.

1304
01:32:55,755 --> 01:32:56,687
A leech!

1305
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:04,195
If I didn't have a few tolerant friends,
I'd starve to death.

1306
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:08,227
But you know how
when I was young,

1307
01:33:08,768 --> 01:33:11,566
I also thought my day would come.

1308
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:18,740
The contact with an audience,
that's what I wanted to have.

1309
01:33:19,045 --> 01:33:21,411
It must be an overwhelming feeling.

1310
01:33:21,814 --> 01:33:24,908
To think that I missed out on it!

1311
01:33:25,818 --> 01:33:30,118
So I feed myself a lot of nonsense,
imagine that it did happen.

1312
01:33:30,323 --> 01:33:31,984
But it takes a drink.

1313
01:33:33,292 --> 01:33:36,523
Back on the porch,
I almost thought it had happened.

1314
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:41,166
But after that comes the fall.

1315
01:33:41,567 --> 01:33:44,468
You have a rough time,
but you get used to it.

1316
01:33:47,406 --> 01:33:49,431
Beautiful night.
Look at the moon.

1317
01:33:49,609 --> 01:33:50,598
Aren't you cold?

1318
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,676
No. What about you?

1319
01:33:55,915 --> 01:33:56,882
Put your hood up.

1320
01:34:12,331 --> 01:34:15,858
- It's Lisette.
- With Octave. The skunk!

1321
01:34:16,736 --> 01:34:19,466
You sure it's her?
- She's wearing her cape.

1322
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:21,397
The one I gave her.

1323
01:34:33,186 --> 01:34:35,620
- I'm cold.
- Let's go back.

1324
01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:37,947
Not to the château.

1325
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,122
Never again.

1326
01:34:40,293 --> 01:34:43,319
In that case,
here in the greenhouse.

1327
01:35:03,549 --> 01:35:07,315
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear a thing.

1328
01:35:08,487 --> 01:35:11,456
Got your gun on you?
Let him have it.

1329
01:35:13,259 --> 01:35:15,454
I used up my bullets on you.

1330
01:35:15,828 --> 01:35:17,056
Poor guy.

1331
01:35:17,263 --> 01:35:19,458
But my father wasn't like that.

1332
01:35:19,966 --> 01:35:23,697
He was a hero, too.
A hero in his own way.

1333
01:35:24,203 --> 01:35:28,105
But when you think of your father,
you're unfair to other men.

1334
01:35:28,975 --> 01:35:29,942
Not at all.

1335
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:34,668
You, you're a fine fellow.
- I'm a failure.

1336
01:35:35,815 --> 01:35:37,976
No, you're not.

1337
01:35:38,818 --> 01:35:41,286
But you need someone
to take care of you.

1338
01:35:42,755 --> 01:35:44,052
I'll take care of you.

1339
01:35:44,523 --> 01:35:47,048
It's too late. I'm too old.

1340
01:35:47,793 --> 01:35:48,760
You fool.

1341
01:35:50,196 --> 01:35:51,527
You know...

1342
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:54,860
it's you I love.

1343
01:35:59,772 --> 01:36:02,206
Do you love me?

1344
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:06,103
Yes, Christine.

1345
01:36:07,046 --> 01:36:08,138
I love you.

1346
01:36:09,515 --> 01:36:11,608
Then kiss me.

1347
01:36:16,522 --> 01:36:18,251
On the mouth, like a lover.

1348
01:36:30,136 --> 01:36:32,696
- I'll kill them both.
- Not her.

1349
01:36:34,573 --> 01:36:35,540
Both of them.

1350
01:36:42,048 --> 01:36:43,515
I'll get my gun.

1351
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:46,916
You can't. Not her.

1352
01:36:49,088 --> 01:36:50,055
Come with me.

1353
01:37:06,138 --> 01:37:10,165
Why don't I stay here
just to keep an eye on 'em?

1354
01:37:12,978 --> 01:37:14,445
No, we stick together.

1355
01:37:36,335 --> 01:37:40,237
There's a train at Lamotte-Beuvron
at 3:00 a.m. Let's take it.

1356
01:37:40,406 --> 01:37:42,306
I'll get your coat.

1357
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,641
Where's Christine?
I'm worried.

1358
01:37:49,682 --> 01:37:51,343
Don't worry.
She's with Octave.

1359
01:37:51,684 --> 01:37:55,450
You can trust him.
After all, you met her through him.

1360
01:37:56,188 --> 01:37:57,382
I don't blame him.

1361
01:37:57,656 --> 01:38:00,318
He's a decent fellow. Very decent.

1362
01:38:00,493 --> 01:38:01,460
I know.

1363
01:38:02,128 --> 01:38:06,656
I believe in little, but I may start
believing in friendship.

1364
01:38:09,235 --> 01:38:10,259
But Octave

1365
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:12,668
is someone special.

1366
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:21,943
- Where's Madame?
- Get her coat.

1367
01:38:23,849 --> 01:38:25,111
Her coat.

1368
01:38:26,385 --> 01:38:27,409
Very well.

1369
01:38:35,294 --> 01:38:38,730
Somebody pinched my hat.
Just great!

1370
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:46,765
- This is wrong.
- Why wrong?

1371
01:38:47,239 --> 01:38:50,208
When it's just for fun,
it doesn't matter.

1372
01:38:51,043 --> 01:38:52,704
But for living together,

1373
01:38:53,179 --> 01:38:56,512
the young are for the young
and the old for the old.

1374
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,445
Did you find my hat?

1375
01:38:58,617 --> 01:39:02,781
And you don't have any money.
Madame needs lots of things.

1376
01:39:03,055 --> 01:39:04,886
What will you do without money?

1377
01:39:05,057 --> 01:39:07,821
They trampled it.
It's all ruined.

1378
01:39:07,993 --> 01:39:10,860
I speak my mind.
You're making a mistake.

1379
01:39:11,397 --> 01:39:13,297
Madame won't be happy with you.

1380
01:39:18,971 --> 01:39:20,836
Will you take me with you?

1381
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:24,870
Sure. You'll join us later.

1382
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:27,175
Where's Christine?

1383
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:34,114
She's waiting for you.

1384
01:39:35,321 --> 01:39:36,288
Waiting for me?

1385
01:39:39,024 --> 01:39:42,983
In the greenhouse
over the footbridge.

1386
01:39:44,163 --> 01:39:45,187
Bring her this.

1387
01:39:46,131 --> 01:39:48,099
Hurry! In the greenhouse.

1388
01:39:50,336 --> 01:39:52,497
You mustn't catch cold.
- Thanks so much.

1389
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,537
I have to kiss you.

1390
01:40:05,918 --> 01:40:07,180
You love her too.

1391
01:40:13,626 --> 01:40:15,719
Lisette, please. Am I crying?

1392
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:27,664
I'm suffering and I just hate it.

1393
01:40:46,258 --> 01:40:47,225
She's alone.

1394
01:40:49,728 --> 01:40:52,219
- I'll go talk to her.
- Sure, let's go.

1395
01:40:52,398 --> 01:40:53,262
Not you.

1396
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,389
Me.

1397
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,136
Listen!

1398
01:41:08,781 --> 01:41:09,748
It's him.

1399
01:41:18,857 --> 01:41:19,881
Christine!

1400
01:41:40,746 --> 01:41:42,577
Did you hear a shot
in the park?

1401
01:41:42,748 --> 01:41:43,544
In the park?

1402
01:41:45,918 --> 01:41:47,351
I was in my room and...

1403
01:41:56,729 --> 01:41:59,391
- It's André, isn't it?
- Yes, Miss Jackie.

1404
01:42:00,099 --> 01:42:03,262
- And Madame?
- Madame is all right.

1405
01:42:03,435 --> 01:42:04,424
Thank you.

1406
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:08,301
Is he dead?

1407
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,240
He didn't suffer.

1408
01:42:19,818 --> 01:42:22,412
He was hit here.

1409
01:42:23,522 --> 01:42:25,956
He dropped like an animal
in the hunt.

1410
01:42:32,798 --> 01:42:35,392
He called out for Madame
and it was over.

1411
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:36,966
Did you shoot him?

1412
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:41,239
It was Schumacher.
But I was in it with him.

1413
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,702
Hurry, Corneille.

1414
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:47,508
Why didn't you let me go?

1415
01:42:48,113 --> 01:42:50,638
What's to become of me now?

1416
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:53,711
Let me go. Madame needs me.

1417
01:42:54,286 --> 01:42:55,378
You're going to

1418
01:42:55,821 --> 01:42:57,254
give her a kiss.

1419
01:42:57,856 --> 01:43:01,690
Give her a kiss
and tell her that I left.

1420
01:43:02,361 --> 01:43:03,385
She'll understand.

1421
01:43:04,063 --> 01:43:06,691
I'll say good-bye now to you, too.

1422
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,366
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Octave.

1423
01:43:11,003 --> 01:43:12,561
I was so fond of you.

1424
01:43:18,544 --> 01:43:20,011
I was fond of you, too.

1425
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:26,315
They need us, Corneille.

1426
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:29,049
By the greenhouse?

1427
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:46,995
Where are you headed?

1428
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:48,765
Back to the woods.

1429
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:53,769
I'll try to pick up
some odd jobs here and there.

1430
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,044
And you?

1431
01:43:56,381 --> 01:43:59,748
I'm going to Paris.
I'll try to manage on my own.

1432
01:43:59,985 --> 01:44:03,921
We may run into each other
again someday.

1433
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:06,157
I doubt it.

1434
01:44:06,992 --> 01:44:09,927
But you never know.
Anything's possible.

1435
01:44:12,631 --> 01:44:13,620
Good luck.

1436
01:44:15,534 --> 01:44:16,523
Good luck.

1437
01:44:28,947 --> 01:44:30,437
Will you excuse me?

1438
01:44:31,784 --> 01:44:34,810
The greenhouse is off-limits.
- Pointard's on guard.

1439
01:44:34,987 --> 01:44:37,820
Work out the formalities
with Corneille.

1440
01:44:40,225 --> 01:44:43,353
- I can't bear it!
- Be strong, Miss Jackie.

1441
01:44:43,562 --> 01:44:47,794
An educated young lady like you
has to put on a brave face.

1442
01:44:47,966 --> 01:44:50,127
People are watching.

1443
01:45:05,384 --> 01:45:06,817
I'll take care of her.

1444
01:45:06,985 --> 01:45:09,476
Try to get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

1445
01:45:09,822 --> 01:45:11,722
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

1446
01:45:23,435 --> 01:45:26,199
It was all a deplorable accident
and nothing more.

1447
01:45:26,371 --> 01:45:29,829
My game warden thought
he saw a poacher and fired.

1448
01:45:30,642 --> 01:45:34,100
As fate would have it,
André Jurieu paid for this error.

1449
01:45:35,547 --> 01:45:39,506
Tomorrow we will leave,
in mourning for this delightful friend,

1450
01:45:39,685 --> 01:45:42,381
this wonderful companion

1451
01:45:42,955 --> 01:45:45,753
who made us forget
that he was famous.

1452
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:50,621
And now, dear friends, it's chilly.
You're going to catch cold.

1453
01:45:50,796 --> 01:45:53,094
I suggest you come inside.

1454
01:45:56,702 --> 01:45:59,296
Tomorrow we'll do our duty
for Jurieu.

1455
01:46:01,473 --> 01:46:04,601
A new definition
of the word "accident."

1456
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:08,076
No, this La Chesnaye has class.

1457
01:46:08,247 --> 01:46:11,910
And that's become rare,
my dear Saint-Aubin.

1458
01:46:12,084 --> 01:46:13,381
That's become rare.

1459
01:46:24,763 --> 01:46:27,664
THE END
