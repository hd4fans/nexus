1
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,870
哟！　　　李爷来啦
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,200
李爷来啦
Master Li is here!

3
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,550
秀莲
Shu Lien!

4
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,690
秀莲
Shu Lien!

5
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,160
秀莲，李慕白来啦
Shu Lien! Li Mu Bai is here!

6
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,270
李爷

7
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,970
家里好吗？　　　 挺好的
How's everything? Fine. Please come in.

8
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,200
请进

9
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,010
慕白兄，好久不见
Mu Bai, it's been too long.

10
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,050
是啊！镖局的生意怎么样？
It has. How's business?

11
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,050
还行，你好吗？
Good. And how are you?

12
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,120
好
Fine.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,230
道元真人，年初从武当山路过这里
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.

14
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,470
说起你正在闭关修练
He said you were practicing deep meditation.

15
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,600
嗯

16
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,340
山上是清静
The mountain must be so peaceful...

17
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,730
有时候我真羡慕你
I envy you.

18
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,980
我光是忙着镖局的生意，静不下来
My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.

19
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,880
我破了戒，提早出关
I left the training early.

20
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,230
为什么？
Why?

21
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,280
道人说这次的闭关对你非常重要
You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.

22
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,090
这次闭关静坐的时候
During my meditation training...

23
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,590
我一度进入了一种很深的寂静
I came to a place of deep silence...

24
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,730
我的周围只有光
I was surrounded by light...

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,770
时间、空间都不存在了
Time and space disappeared.

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,000
我似乎触到了…
I had come to a place...

27
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,800
师父从未指点过的境地
my master had never told me about.

28
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,810
你得道了？
You were enlightened?

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,770
我没有这种感觉
No.

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,680
因为我并没有得道的喜悦
I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,550
相反的…
Instead...

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,350
却被一种寂灭的悲哀环绕
I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.

33
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,050
这悲哀超过了我能承受的极限
I couldn't bear it.

34
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,760
我出了定，没办法再继续
I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on.

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,770
有些事…我需要想想
There was something... pulling me back.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,570
什么事？
What was it?

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,270
一些心里放不下的事
Something I can't let go of.

38
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,580
你要出门了吗？
You're leaving soon?

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,000
有一趟镖要到北京
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,380
已经收拾好了，就要上路
to Peking.

41
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,120
有件东西…
Perhaps I could ask you

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,160
烦劳你替我带给贝勒爷
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

43
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,470
青冥剑！把它送给贝勒爷？
The Green Destiny sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,630
是啊
I am.

45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,130
贝勒爷一直是最关心我们的人
He has always been our greatest protector.

46
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,550
我还是不明白
I don't understand.

47
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,940
这是你随身的佩剑
How can you part with it?

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,640
这么多年，它一直都跟着你
It has always been with you.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,950
跟着我惹来不少的江湖恩怨
Too many men have died at its edge.

50
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,080
你看它干干净净的
It only looks pure...

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,480
因为它杀人不沾血
because blood washes so easily from its blade.

52
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,840
你不是个滥杀无辜的人
You use it justly,

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,990
所以你才配用这把剑
you're worthy of it.

54
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,430
该是离开这些恩怨的时候了
It's time for me to leave it behind.

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,670
离开？

56
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,100
之后呢？
So what will you do now?

57
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,040
干脆和我一起去北京
Come with me to Peking.

58
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,070
我觉得你应该亲手把剑交给贝勒爷
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,740
记得我们以前经常结伴去北京吗？
It'll be just like old times.

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,270
我这趟下山，想先去给恩师扫墓
First I must visit my master's grave.

61
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
恩师遭碧眼狐狸暗算…
It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,990
这么多年了，师仇还没报
I have yet to avenge his death.

63
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,560
我竟然萌生了退出江湖的念头
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

64
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,460
我想我该去求他的原谅
I must pray for his forgiveness.

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,700
既然是这样

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,500
办完了事，你到北京跟我会合
Join me once you have finished.

67
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,740
你来，我就等你
I can wait for you in Peking.

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,270
也许吧
Perhaps.

69
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,810
可以了
Ok. Pass.

70
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,550
各位爷，谢了
Thanks.

71
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,450
进城，交了货歇着
Let's go into the city.

72
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,680
进城！

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,460
进城！

74
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,430
谢天谢地，俞姑娘辛苦了
Everything got here safely. I'm much obliged.

75
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,170
哪儿的话

76
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,930
人货平安是我们跑镖应该的
Just doing my job.

77
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,130
“雄远镖局”的招牌…
Sun Security has been the best...

78
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,430
打俞师父起就从来没有砸过
since your father started it.

79
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,680
您押了这几趟

80
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,780
您父亲的在天之灵应该放心了
You're a credit to his memory.

81
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,150
那可不敢说
Thank you.

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,810
是怎么回事，就怎么回事
I mean it.

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,620
这是慕白的贴身佩剑
This is Li Mu Bai's personal sword,

84
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,490
宝剑佩英雄
a great hero's weapon.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,050
当今天下
He is the only one...

86
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,150
论剑法、论武德
in the world...

87
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,850
只有慕白配使用这把剑
worthy of carrying it.

88
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,260
礼太重，我不能收
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

89
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,430
贝勒爷
Sir Te...

90
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,030
这把剑惹了无数江湖恩怨
it has brought him as much trouble as glory.

91
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,970
慕白说，他要从此离开这些恩怨
Help him to leave these troubles behind.

92
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,570
您不收下，恩怨不了
Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

93
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,150
嗯，也是，我就替他管着吧
All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,180
九门提督府玉大人到
Governor Yu has arrived.

95
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,980
更衣
I must change.

96
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,050
是

97
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,230
多谢贝勒爷…

98
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,330
一直关照我和慕白的事
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.

99
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,450
我不该多打扰，晚辈告辞了
Please accept our thanks.

100
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,560
别急着走
Please do not be such a stranger.

101
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,960
你不是外人，在这儿住下
You'll stay the night as my guest.

102
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,100
秀莲啊！告诉我一件事
Now, Shu Lien, tell me something.

103
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,710
可别怪我多事
And forgive me for prying.

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,970
就因为你的爹是我的好友
Your father was a great friend to me,

105
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,350
我一直把你当成自己的女儿看待
and I think of you as my own daughter.

106
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,480
贝勒爷有什么话，请尽管说
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

107
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,620
李慕白突然交出青冥剑
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword

108
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,120
又退出了江湖…
and his warrior days...

109
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,390
莫非他向你暗示些什么
Maybe he's trying to tell you something?

110
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,660
我不知道
I don't know...

111
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,820
不要害羞
Don't be coy.

112
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,620
你们的感情我是知道的
I've always known about your feelings for each other.

113
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,500
只是你们太小心翼翼
All these years, it's a shame...

114
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,900
总是不敢向对方承认这份感情
...neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other.

115
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,240
白白的浪费多年的光阴
You're both wasting precious time.

116
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,940
我跟慕白都不是胆怯的人
I beg your pardon.

117
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,850
也许事情并不是您想的那样
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

118
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,910
面对情字
When it comes to emotions,

119
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,510
再大的英雄也是莫可奈何呀
even great heroes can be idiots.

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,260
下回遇了他，他要是再不肯明讲
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.

121
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,700
告诉我，我去跟他说
I'll give him an earful!

122
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,070
贝勒爷说，就搁在这屋里
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.

123
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,440
您…
Who are you?

124
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,650
我是府上今儿的客
I'm your guest today.

125
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,780
是玉府的小姐
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

126
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,790
这是贝勒爷的书斋，姑娘您…
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to?

127
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,010
外头人多我头昏
I was just...

128
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,560
想找个清静的地方透口气儿
looking for a quiet corner.

129
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,970
小的是铁府管事得禄
I am Sir Te's head servant.

130
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,970
这也是贝勒爷的客
And this is another of our guests.

131
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,250
这么沉？剑不就是片薄铁吗？
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!

132
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,820
沉的是剑柄，剑身倒也不是薄铁
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal.

133
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,660
剑走轻灵，兵器里它算是最轻的
Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons.

134
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,270
你没摸过兵器就觉得它沉
You're just not used to handling it.

135
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,860
谁说我没摸过兵器，摸过的
But, I have had much practice.

136
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,140
我爹在新疆，家里养有府兵
As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,170
能摸他们的兵器，也玩儿
They'd let me play with their weapons.

138
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,770
这剑套真好看
The scabbard is so beautiful.

139
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,540
再好看也是凶器
Beautiful but dangerous.

140
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,600
刃上染了血
Once you see it tainted with blood,

141
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,880
你就不会说它好看了
its beauty is hard to admire.

142
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,950
这把剑有四百年的来历
It's 400 years old.

143
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,920
真好看
Exquisite!

144
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,320
你刚才说这把剑是归…
You said it belongs to...

145
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,600
原本是我恩兄李慕白的
My friend Li Mu Bai.

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,690
现在他送给了贝勒爷
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

147
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,040
李慕白？我在新疆都听说过他
Li Mu Bai!

148
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
大名鼎鼎的
The famous warrior?

149
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,940
可他为什么把这把剑…
Why would he give his sword...

150
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,730
给了贝勒爷呢
to Sir Te?

151
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,570
说多了你也不懂
You're too young to understand.

152
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,410
俞姐是使剑的吧
You're a sword fighter too?

153
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,380
我使双刀，剑法我略懂一二
Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete.

154
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,280
李慕白的武当玄牝剑法
Certain moves,

155
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,050
真是得用这把剑才行啊
however, call for a sword.

156
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,480
是吧
Really?

157
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,450
你在江湖上走来走去的…
It must be exciting to be a fighter,

158
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,850
是不是很好玩？
to be totally free!

159
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,930
走江湖…
Fighters have rules too:

160
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,930
靠的是人熟，讲信、讲义
friendship, trust,

161
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,190
应下来的，就要做到
integrity... Without rules,

162
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,830
不讲信义，可就玩不长了
we wouldn't survive for long.

163
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,830
可我看书上说的…
I've read all about...

164
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,130
都是挺有意思的
people like you.

165
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,130
到处都能去，遇上不服气的就打
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!

166
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,500
写书的不那么写
Writers wouldn't sell many books...

167
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,240
书就没法子卖了
if they told how it really is.

168
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,300
我看你就象书里的人
But you're just like the characters in the stories.

169
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,170
洗不上澡
Sure. No place to bathe for days,

170
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,570
虱子跳蚤咬得睡不着觉
sleeping in flea-infested beds...

171
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,710
书里也写这个？
They tell you all about that in those books?

172
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,950
你知道我说的是什么
You know what I mean.

173
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,600
我就要嫁人了
I'm getting married soon,

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,210
可还没过过我自己想过的日子
but I haven't lived the life I want.

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,360
我听人说起过，恭喜了
So I heard. Congratulations.

176
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,570
嫁人是大事
It's the most important step...

177
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,970
女人一辈子，总是要嫁人的
in a woman's life, isn't it?

178
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,080
俞姐，还没嫁人吧？
You're not married, are you?

179
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,580
你看呢？
What do you think?

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,010
没有，嫁了人还能跑来跑去的？
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,750
说你不懂事吧，又懂点事
You're probably right.

182
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,280
玉大人，看看
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

183
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,200
长二尺九，宽一寸一
2 feet 9 inches long. 1 inch wide.

184
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,300
护手一寸，宽二寸六，厚七分
The handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide.\n7 tenths of an inch thick.

185
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,630
两耳各一寸五

186
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,670
剑柄原镶有七星
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

187
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,540
从剑的旋纹看…
You can tell the design

188
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,070
是先秦吴国的揉剑法
dates back to before the Chin era.

189
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,210
到汉朝就失传了
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.

190
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,850
贝勒爷真是博古通今哪
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

191
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,220
剑要人用才能活
A sword by itself rules nothing.

192
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,820
所谓剑法即人法
It comes alive only through skillful manipulation.

193
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,290
卑职愿闻其详
I see your point. Please continue.

194
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,670
这京城内城…还好说
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

195
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,110
无非是皇亲国戚
With royalty and officials everywhere,

196
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,030
各部的官员，加之八旗军…
the Royal Guard...

197
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,530
布防严密，各有辖区
keeps security tight.

198
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,500
这外城就杂了
But Peking is not like the West.

199
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,910
三教九流，往来人等
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters.

200
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,700
玉大人整治京畿
Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order.

201
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,720
不能只眼看着朝廷
Don't depend only on the court.

202
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,520
江湖上…也要有所联络
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld

203
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,920
九门提督才坐得稳
can ensure your position.

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,430
刚柔相济，方得治道
Be strong yet supple. This is the way to rule.

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
高师娘
Governess...

206
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,200
我来好了
Let me do it.

207
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,280
师娘坐
Please sit.

208
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,530
做了两件睡衣，丝料的
I've made you silk pajamas.

209
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,580
要不要换上？
Do you want to change into them?

210
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,910
放着吧
Put them down.

211
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,520
听说你见到俞秀莲了？
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

212
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,090
你知道她？
Do you know her?

213
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
听说她是道上的人
She's one of those.

214
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,960
夫人不会让你跟那路人混吧
Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

215
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,530
我愿意跟谁混就跟谁混
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

216
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,500
麻烦进了家，就真麻烦
Don't invite danger into your father's house.

217
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,970
我困了
I'm tired now!

218
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,340
那就睡吧
Go to bed then.

219
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,750
小姐长大了，要嫁人了
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.

220
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,850
以后真不知道会怎么样
God knows what the future will bring.

221
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
还不是一样
It'll be just the same.

222
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,290
好了吧？我困了
Enough! I'm tired.

223
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,900
立秋了，我去帮你把窗子关好
Autumn is coming. I'll shut the windows for you.

224
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,860
天冷了
Chilly, eh?

225
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,130
刘师傅
Yes, Master Bo.

226
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,790
来人啊
Someone help!

227
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,360
快来！有贼
Stop him!

228
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,920
上房顶了
He's on the roof!

229
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,070
有人偷宝剑啦！
The sword's been stolen!

230
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,160
上房顶了

231
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,110
抓贼！快，抓贼！
Stop thief!

232
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,610
快搬梯子

233
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,480
有贼呀

234
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,970
看看有没有在房顶上？

235
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,800
抓住他…给我剥了狐狸皮
Stop him! It's Jade Fox!

236
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,270
给我抓住他

237
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,460
我给娘报仇
We must avenge Mother!

238
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,510
你们还站在这儿干什么，快追啊！
Do something! He's getting away!

239
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,040
宝剑物归原主，现在话还好说
Return the sword and I'll let you go.

240
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,950
你是武当派的门人？
You've been trained at Wudan?

241
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,660
我们是从外地来卖艺的

242
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,860
你弄错了
You're mistaken.

243
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,760
我正带着闺女练功呢，走吧！
We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.

244
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,960
爹
Father!

245
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,700
练功？你以为我也是在练功的？
You were rehearsing? Who are you trying to fool?

246
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,430
人哪儿去了
Where did that thief go?

247
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,780
九门提督府？
Governor Yu's house!

248
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,150
给我下来
Get down here!

249
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,430
下来
Get down!

250
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,830
剑给我
Give back the sword!

251
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,210
贝勒爷在厅里候着哪
Sir Te awaits you.

252
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,180
青冥剑是没找回来

253
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,370
可我敢赌…
I'm sure...

254
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,180
贼人与玉大人家有瓜葛
the thief is in the Yu household.

255
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,160
查他个底儿掉

256
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,420
放肆
How dare you imply?

257
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,520
可我明明见着…退下
Enough!

258
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,930
玉大人看过青冥剑吗？
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

259
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,570
看过
Yes,

260
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,480
我想跟玉大人没有关系
though I doubt he's involved in this.

261
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,410
可是剑现在应该在玉府
But the sword could be in his compound.

262
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,110
有人要陷害玉大人
Then someone's trying to set him up.

263
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,810
这不是不可能的事情

264
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,290
这件事应该让慕白知道
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

265
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,120
夫人您小心啊

266
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,140
怎么啦？　　　玉夫人…
What is it?      Madam Yu,

267
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,130
有人在墙上乱贴东西
someone's put up posters.

268
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,580
给我看看
Let me see.

269
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,010
（通缉，碧眼狐狸就在玉府）

270
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,210
是谁跟这碧眼狐狸有仇啊…
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

271
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,310
放肆到府上来了
Preposterous, looking for her here!

272
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,570
说的是天下第一枪…

273
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,340
还是杨家枪

274
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,040
说的是第一枪…

275
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,000
还是我亲爹您哪！

276
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,590
快说

277
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,860
大爷，我是真是不知道啊
Where are they? I don't know.

278
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,750
…许是离开了吧

279
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,750
前两天还见着她呢
I haven't seen them in two days.

280
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,610
小姐，外头有位俞秀莲小姐求见
There's a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.

281
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,230
小姐正没空呢
Miss is busy right now.

282
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,560
那就回了她
I'll tell her.

283
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,360
请俞姑娘进来
Show her in.

284
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,890
是

285
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,700
小姐，麻烦真是进了家了
This spells trouble.

286
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,600
我有客
I have a guest.

287
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,510
俞小姐请
This way please.

288
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,480
俞姐姐，你想死我了
I've missed you.

289
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,590
想我干嘛
How so?

290
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,150
没事干呗
I'm bored...

291
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,260
练字啊
You're doing calligraphy?

292
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,930
我写俞姐姐的名字…练着玩儿
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

293
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,720
这“俞”写起来真象“剑”
I never realized my name looks like "sword".

294
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
我看你转手腕
You write gracefully.

295
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,500
书法剑法，道理好象是相通的
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

296
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,040
大概是吧！我不知道
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

297
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,880
请
Please.

298
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,920
谢谢你抽空见我
Thank you for seeing me.

299
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,850
听说你大喜的日子快到了
I hear your wedding day is near.

300
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,150
想必正为这件事忙着吧
You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.

301
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,280
才不呢能，不想它最好
I'm hardly doing a thing.

302
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,160
我什么也不愿意管
The less I think of it the better.

303
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,250
反正婚事由我爹娘决定
My parents are arranging everything.

304
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,100
他们一到京城

305
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,250
就替我定下这门亲事

306
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,060
他们说鲁老太爷是朝内的大官
The Gous are a very powerful family.

307
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,600
又是三代翰林

308
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,330
如果能跟鲁家联姻
My marrying one will be good...

309
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,830
对爹在北京大有好处
for my father's career.

310
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,710
能跟这样的名门望族结亲
You are fortunate...

311
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,610
这是福气
to marry into such a noble family.

312
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,200
是吗？
Am I?

313
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,610
我倒是喜欢象那些…
I wish I were like...

314
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,610
侠义小说里的英雄儿女
the heroes in the books I read.

315
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,170
就好象你和李慕白一样
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

316
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,620
结婚固然是喜事
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

317
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,180
要是能够自由自在的生活
But to be free to live my own life,

318
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,050
选择自己心爱的人
to choose whom I love...

319
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,550
用自己的方式去爱他

320
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,990
那才算得上是真正的幸福
That is true happiness.

321
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,890
那…我给你讲个故事
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story...

322
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,560
是你和李慕白的事儿？
About you and Li Mu Bai?

323
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,170
是吧
Yes.

324
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,330
我小时候家里也给定过亲
Did you know I was once engaged to be married?

325
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,060
是吗？
No, really?

326
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,910
他的名字叫孟思昭
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

327
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,070
他跟李慕白也是拜把的兄弟
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

328
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,710
有一回，在一场打斗里
One day, while in battle,

329
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,470
孟思昭为了救李慕白
he was killed by the sword

330
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,570
死在对手的刀下
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

331
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,710
这之后…
After,

332
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,510
我们虽然又共同经历了许多事
Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.

333
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,750
感情…也日渐深厚
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

334
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,340
可是我们都坚持要对得起思昭…
But how could we dishonor

335
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,090
和那一纸婚约
Meng's memory?

336
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,330
你说的自由自在，我也渴望
So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.

337
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,630
但我从来没有尝过
But I have never tasted it.

338
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
可是你和李慕白谁也没有错啊
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

339
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,970
只怪那位孟大侠福薄

340
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,370
爱就爱了呗

341
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,950
我虽然不是出身于…
I am not an aristocrat,

342
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,000
你们这样的官宦人家
as you are...

343
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,250
可是一个女人一生该服从的…
but I must still respect...

344
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,710
道德和礼教并不少于你们
a woman's duties.

345
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,020
别说你们我们
Don't distance us.

346
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,610
我要认你这个姐姐
From now on, let's be like sisters.

347
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,610
以后你跟我说话…

348
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,350
不许再这么见外了

349
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,990
好，既然作你的姐姐
Then as a sister,

350
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,290
就希望你真的得到幸福
let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

351
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,800
千里迢迢啊！千里迢迢
What a godforsaken place!

352
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,170
你爹这回调到伊梨
Can't your father be appointed...

353
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,170
还是出不了新疆，这地方…
closer to civilization?

354
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,910
娇龙…你听着了吗？
Jen...are you listening to me?

355
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,540
走吧
Let's go.

356
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,570
你是谁？在干嘛　　　爹
Who are you?

357
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,840
别…您别拿朋友当外人
Wait! I'm a friend!

358
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,200
对那把剑…
I...

359
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,300
我们父女俩一点儿也不上心
don't care about your sword.

360
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,750
那你们盯着玉府干嘛
Why were you spying on the Yus?

361
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,120
我是找个人…碧眼狐狸
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

362
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,440
刘爷

363
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,040
不瞒您说，我是陕甘的总捕头
I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

364
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,880
这碧眼狐狸犯了好几桩案子
Jade Fox is a master criminal.

365
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,520
听说混进了玉府
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

366
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,490
玉大人从新疆调北京
She must have come with them...

367
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,490
这碧眼狐狸一定跟着过来
when they transferred here.

368
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,330
碍着玉大人的面，又不能明拿
But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

369
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,430
只有想办法把她引出来

370
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,160
这碧眼狐狸是公的还是母的？
This Jade Fox is a woman?

371
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,760
母的
Yes.

372
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,800
母的就交给我了
Then leave her to me.

373
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,260
蔡爷，您就别操心了

374
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,300
得罪了，刘爷，您真的拿不住她
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.

375
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,910
我内人也是武行中有名有姓的
My wife was quite a martial arts expert.

376
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,710
都被她害了
Jade Fox killed her.

377
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,370
刘爷，您歇着
So you see,

378
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,170
于公于私，这都是我的事
this is personal. Leave her to me.

379
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,190
丸子熟了
It's ready.

380
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,990
该熟的都熟了
I'm ready for anything!

381
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,590
不行！爹先
Father gets first dip.

382
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,090
走啦
They're gone!

383
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,360
写着什么？
What does it say?

384
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,900
今晚酉时黄土岗上，一决生死！
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."

385
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,700
好，狐狸出洞了
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

386
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,510
请

387
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,110
秀莲，你看谁来了
Shu Lien, look who's here.

388
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,000
贝勒爷觉得这样把嫌疑…
Sir Te believes it's a ploy...

389
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,290
贸然指向玉府，十分不妥
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

390
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,260
但玉府里确实有些蹊跷
But something is going on at the Yu household.

391
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,960
我得彻底弄清楚

392
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,520
你发现了什么？
What have you discovered?

393
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,940
碧眼狐狸？不可能
Jade Fox? Impossible!

394
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,440
你早就怀疑她逃去了西域
You'd always suspected she'd fled to the West.

395
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,320
可是没有想到她藏身在北京
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!

396
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,050
有什么比逗留在玉大人府里…
Is there any place...

397
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,450
更安全的
safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?

398
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,430
师父的仇终于可以报了
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

399
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,490
慕白，还是谨慎一点
Be careful.

400
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,100
这事贝勒爷不许声张…
Sir Te requires discretion.

401
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,740
原本只是公事公办都已经难了
Official business is difficult enough.

402
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,180
再加上你的私仇
Don't let personal...

403
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,330
岂不是会闹得一团糟
feelings make it worse.

404
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,600
再说，这张贴纸也不见得可信
And I don't know... even this poster...

405
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,800
难说不是个圈套
could be some sort of trap.

406
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,950
你看见是谁贴了吗？
Did you see who posted it?

407
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,270
没见着
No.

408
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,740
上面明指碧眼狐狸在玉府
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

409
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
铁爷说，丢失宝剑那天晚上
On the night of the theft...

410
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,710
玉府附近有打斗
there was a brawl near Yu's.

411
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,780
当时你在场吗？
Were you involved?

412
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,950
我…没有
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

413
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,290
听说是护院刘泰保…
I hear he...

414
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,890
一路追他追到玉府
followed the thief to the Yus'.

415
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,570
你查问过他没有？
Have you questioned him yet?

416
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,420
刘泰保啊？还没有…
No, not yet...

417
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,600
你也没有布置镖师盯住玉府？
But your men are watching over Yu's compound?

418
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,800
我早就差他们回去了
No, I'd already sent them home.

419
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,200
宝剑失窃的事，你尽可以怪罪我
You can blame me for losing the sword,

420
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,780
但是请你相信，我有我的法子
but please trust that I'll get it back soon

421
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,540
很快给你找回来
using my own methods.

422
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,870
你误会我的意思
That's not what I meant.

423
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,470
我并不在乎这把宝剑
I don't care about the sword.

424
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,980
你专程赶来北京处理这件事
What do you mean?

425
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,580
怎么能说是不在乎？
Didn't you come back here for it?

426
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,020
我来北京以前
I didn't know it was stolen...

427
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,520
并不知道宝剑失窃的事
until I got here.

428
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,390
那你来是…
Then, why did you come?

429
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,970
我以为我们…已经讲好了嘛
Well, we had talked...

430
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,740
打搅二位
Pardon my intrusion. Master Li,

431
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,340
李爷，您房间收拾好了
your room is ready.

432
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,940
多谢
Thank you.

433
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,280
请得总管带路
Please, lead the way.

434
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,060
说来，就得守信哪
The Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

435
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,390
怎么还闻不到骚味儿？
Still no sign of her.

436
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,340
好啦！不要再装啦
Enough! Show yourself!

437
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,280
蔡九，你这臭当差的
Tsai...You dog!

438
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,510
你不给我活路，我也不让你活
You will pay for your stubbornness!

439
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,220
嘿，你这个老太太
That's what you think,

440
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,820
怎么张口就骂人哪？
old witch!

441
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,250
要是你束手就擒
If you surrender now,

442
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,850
也算你走了一次正道
you'll suffer less.

443
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,230
否则的话，我今天就销了你的案
But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.

444
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,390
爹，我要给我娘报仇
Father! Let me avenge my mother's death!

445
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,900
小婊子！一起来送死
You'll soon end up like her, you little whore!

446
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,630
你这个老狐狸

447
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,630
老成这样了还嘴硬
You'll pay for that!

448
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,270
爹

449
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
你这老狐狸，害得我家破人亡

450
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,960
我今天杀了你…

451
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,320
小心她的点穴
She's going to paralyze you!

452
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,290
香妹
May!

453
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,040
蔡老狗
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

454
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,580
你们还有个打埋伏的
An ambush!

455
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,710
爹…您没事吧，没事
Father, are you all right?

456
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,450
武当派早该铲除你这个妖孽
Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago.

457
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,080
久违了，碧眼狐狸
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

458
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,090
你也许不记得我李慕白
You don't remember me...

459
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
不过，你一定不会忘记…
But you should remember...

460
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,030
我师父江南鹤吧
my master.

461
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,560
当年我在九华山…闭关练剑
You infiltrated Wudan while I was away.

462
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,730
你冒充道姑，潜入武当
You stole our secret manual

463
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,230
盗走心诀，毒害我师父
and poisoned our master!

464
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,520
今天该是你偿还…
Now it's time...

465
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,370
这一段师门血债的时候了
for you to pay!

466
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,430
你师父可惜太小看女人
Your master underestimated us women.

467
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,580
即使入了房纬
Sure, he'd sleep with me,

468
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,580
也不肯把功夫传给我
but he would never teach me.

469
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,480
叫他死在女人手里
He deserved to die...

470
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,580
一点也不冤枉
by a woman's hand!

471
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,420
你盗取武当绝学，十年练剑
You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts.

472
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,420
只练得一身走火入魔的邪招
But after ten years of training your moves are still undisciplined.

473
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,100
今天教你命送武当宗门剑法之下
And today, under a Wudan sword...

474
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,300
对你，也不冤枉
you will die!

475
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,200
徒弟，来，该杀的都在这儿了
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

476
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,940
快走
Let's go!

477
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,380
狐狸还有徒弟？
Another one!

478
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,180
不行！我得除掉那老蔡狗
I must get rid of Tsai!

479
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,340
走

480
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,790
你是谁？
Who are you?

481
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,960
青冥剑为什么在你手里？
Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

482
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,060
你管得着吗？
What's it to you?

483
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,860
在下李慕白
My name is Li Mu Bai.

484
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,870
青冥剑是我的剑
The Green Destiny is mine.

485
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,300
碧眼狐狸绝对不是你师父
Jade Fox can't be your master.

486
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,410
你这“玄牝剑法”从哪里学来的？
Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?

487
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,380
随便玩玩
I'm just playing around.

488
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,990
你师父是谁？
Tell me, who is your master?

489
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,390
小婊子！你给我死

490
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,710
爹

491
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,280
快走，我要斩草除根
Let's go! We must kill them!

492
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,850
快走！别跟他打

493
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,920
走，快走

494
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,820
爹
Father!

495
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,120
爹
Father!

496
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,970
爹
Father!

497
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,440
这就是蔡九
This is Tsai?

498
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,520
我爹，陕甘捕头，蔡九
My father. Police inspector from Shaan.

499
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,190
按说京师命案…
This should be reported...

500
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,390
应该由九门提督来处置
to Governor Yu.

501
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,730
死者又是官差
The victim is an officer.

502
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,790
你确定杀人者就在玉府？
You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound?

503
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,570
我拿性命担保
I'd bet my life on it!

504
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,940
你们随我来
Come with me.

505
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,880
这件事情得尽快的解决
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

506
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,710
玉府那里我去办
I'll get into the Yu household...

507
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,520
一定要查个水落石出
and get her.

508
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,020
让碧眼狐狸跟她的同党…
I'll ferret out Fox...

509
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,620
都现出原形
and her gang.

510
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,850
太莽撞了
We must be careful.

511
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,590
玉大人是朝廷的命官
Yu is a court official,

512
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,590
又掌管京城的治安
and in charge of security.

513
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,750
这件事足以毁掉…
Any disturbance will...

514
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,260
玉大人一生的清誉
cast suspicion on him.

515
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,600
也会让贝勒爷陷入两难的局面
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

516
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,960
这事难办
This is a delicate matter.

517
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,300
贝勒爷，您能不能找个什么借口…
Sir Te, can you find some excuse

518
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,720
把玉夫人和玉小姐…
to invite...

519
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,370
请到府里来坐坐？
Madam Yu and her daughter?

520
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,270
哦？你是打算…
What do you have in mind?

521
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,010
要抓老狐狸，最好从小狐狸着手
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

522
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,280
哎呀，真过意不去

523
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,980
买了料子还要我们挑

524
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,380
到底是福晋
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.

525
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,950
我们嫁闺女，可让你们费心了
She's being so considerate.

526
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,660
福晋这两天着了点凉
I'm sorry she's not feeling well...

527
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,260
陪不了你们
enough to receive you today.

528
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,270
听说贝勒府上丢东西了
I heard Sir Te lost something.

529
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,640
真是的，福晋身体又不合适
And now Madam Te's not feeling well...

530
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,940
丢的东西，已经知道是谁拿了
We know who stole the missing item.

531
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,610
其实拿了剑的人
If the thief...

532
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,810
能自己把剑放回去
returns it,

533
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,770
贝勒爷给面子，也就不追究了
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.

534
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,850
那就好了
That's good.

535
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,950
有时候，这下人手脚不干净
Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves.

536
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,950
也是挺烦人的
It's very embarrassing.

537
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,390
贝勒爷的意思是…
Sir Te knows that

538
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,990
再好的人也有犯错的时候
even well-meaning people can make mistakes...

539
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,960
有的错误不仅是害了自己
that can bring ruin to themselves...

540
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,660
还连累了全家人
and their families.

541
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,670
有时候这心也不能太软
But don't be too lenient.

542
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:06,530
是啊

543
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,030
好比说最近这里出了个杀人的
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer

544
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,540
贝勒爷就绝对饶不过他
who turned up in Peking.

545
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,640
城里也会出这种事？
A murderer?

546
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,580
可不是
Yes,

547
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,310
凶手就是当年毒害…
the very killer of...

548
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,910
我恩兄李慕白师父的女贼
Li Mu Bai's own master.

549
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,110
昨儿夜里把一个…
Last night,

550
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,610
追捕她好多年的捕头给杀了
she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

551
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,820
女贼有这么大的本事，那倒新鲜
A female criminal! Now that's news!

552
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,990
怎么？你说她杀的是个官差？
You say she killed a policeman?

553
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,860
是位陕甘的名捕
Yes, from the West.

554
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,490
化装成江湖卖艺的
He went undercover,

555
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,390
一路跟上北京城里来的
and followed her here.

556
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,530
唉，我瞎说啊
Maybe the murderer

557
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,230
偷剑杀人会不会是同一个人？
and the thief are the same.

558
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,310
应该是不至于
I doubt that.

559
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,600
这个盗剑人…很不寻常
This thief...is very unusual.

560
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,810
应该不会这么傻的
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

561
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,360
娇龙给贝勒爷请安
Greetings, Sir Te.

562
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,660
好…

563
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,200
玉夫人安好
Hello, Madam Yu.

564
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,050
这位是李慕白，有名的侠士
This is Li Mu Bai, the renowned swordsman.

565
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,070
玉夫人、玉小姐，幸会
Delighted to meet you.

566
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,840
玉小姐就要出阁了
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

567
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,400
福气，福气
Congratulations.

568
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,020
来了怎么不进来呢
Why don't you come in?

569
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,830
给你守个门
I'm standing guard.

570
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,820
外头冷，进屋里来吧
Come in. It's cold.

571
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,570
进来吧
Come in.

572
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,770
两个人就不怕打不过碧眼狐狸了
We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together.

573
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,800
这么晚了，还不歇着？
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

574
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,870
来还剑吗？
You've brought me the sword?

575
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,000
高兴就还，不高兴就不还
I do as I please.

576
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,480
你师父在哪？
Where is your master?

577
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,800
你管不着
What's it to you?

578
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
飞够了？
Had enough flying?

579
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,040
天份不错
You've got potential.

580
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,840
只不过你们对武当心诀的领略…
You've studied the Wudan manual...

581
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,540
理路不正
but you don't understand it.

582
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,020
你需要良师的调教，重理剑法
You need a real master.

583
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,040
想当我师父？
Do you think you are a real master?

584
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,750
谁知道你是不是浪得虚名

585
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,420
“李慕白”就是虚名
Like most things, I am nothing.

586
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,660
宗派是虚名，剑法也是虚名

587
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,530
这把青冥剑还是虚名
It's the same for this sword.

588
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,930
一切都是人心的作用
All of it is simply a state of mind.

589
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,400
别到了庙里就说和尚的话，出招！
Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!

590
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,070
那就快告诉我，碧眼狐狸在哪里
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

591
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,870
看招！
On guard!

592
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,490
揣而锐之，不可长保
Real sharpness comes without effort.

593
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,010
勿助、勿长
No growth. Without assistance.

594
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,510
不应、不辩
No action. Without reaction.

595
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,550
无知无欲
No desire without restraint.

596
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,610
“舍己从人”才能“我顺人背”
Now give yourself up and find yourself again.

597
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,360
教你一点做人处事的道理
There is a lesson for you.

598
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,790
下手吧
Go ahead.

599
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,630
何必？
Why should I?

600
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,530
你还要修练，修武德
You need practice.

601
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,930
才能体会静中之动的境界
I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny,

602
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,410
才配得上用这把青冥剑
but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.

603
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,980
你为什么要教我？
Why do you want to teach me?

604
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,140
我一直在想找一个徒弟
I've always wanted a disciple

605
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,210
能把武当派的“玄牝剑法”传下去
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

606
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,110
你不怕我学会了杀了你
And if I use them to kill you?

607
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,950
即为师徒，就要以性命相见
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

608
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,990
我相信
Deep down, you're good.

609
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,890
碧眼狐狸未能泯灭了你的良心
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

610
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,390
武当山是酒馆娼窑，我不希罕
Wudan is a whorehouse! Keep your lessons!

611
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,620
该说你回来早呢，还是回来晚了
You're home late, or should I say early?

612
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,930
你怎么还在这儿？
Why are you still here?

613
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,090
你杀了狗官差
You killed a policeman.

614
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,890
不能再待在这儿了
You should leave!

615
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,500
我跟你说过了

616
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,330
你会连累我们全家的
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

617
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,800
要不是你盗走了青冥剑
They wouldn't have found me...

618
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,600
别人怎么会发现我在这儿？
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

619
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,240
你不小了
Like a little girl,

620
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,640
你以为拿走了青冥剑是好玩的？
you thought stealing would be fun?

621
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,300
我有份，你就有份
You, too, are responsible for that death.

622
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,500
咱俩一起走
Come with me.

623
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,040
要是你真成了朝廷命官的夫人
You don't want to waste your life...

624
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,740
你会憋死的
as the wife of some bureaucrat.

625
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,590
天份也埋没了
Denied your talent...

626
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,020
来，我们师徒两人…
As master and disciple we will rule.

627
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,650
我不会跟你去做江洋大盗
I'll never live as a thief!

628
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,560
你已经是人人捉拿的江洋大盗了
You're already a thief.

629
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,050
我只是想玩玩
That was just for fun.

630
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,520
我干嘛走，我走哪儿去？
How can I leave? Where would I go?

631
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,760
哪儿都行

632
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,860
想干什么就干什么
Wherever we want.

633
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,790
谁想拦我们，就杀他个痛快
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

634
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,890
就连你爹也一样
Even your father.

635
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,200
你给我闭嘴
Shut up!

636
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,660
这就是江湖
It's the Giang Hu

637
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,200
恩恩怨怨、你死我活
fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed.

638
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,270
很吓人，也很刺激，是吧？
Exciting, isn't it?

639
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,750
对你，我已仁至义尽了
I owe you nothing.

640
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,110
仁至义尽的是我
Yes, you do!

641
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,310
收你为徒…
You are still my disciple.

642
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,720
是我这一辈子最得意的一件事

643
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,300
你以为这几年是你…
You think you've been...

644
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,630
在教我《武当剑法心诀》吗？
teaching me all these years from the manual?

645
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,030
幸亏你识字不多
You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

646
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,200
我依图，你依字…
I studied the diagrams.

647
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,700
原来你留了一手
But you hid the details!

648
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,950
那些字就算你知道也不能体会
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.

649
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,750
你心里明白
You know...

650
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,350
你的功夫就只能练到这里了
you've gone as far as you can go.

651
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,890
我藏而不露，也只是怕你伤心
I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.

652
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,460
要不是李慕白那天…
If I hadn't seen...

653
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,460
试出了你的功力
you fight with Li Mu Bai,

654
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,320
我还真不知道你瞒了我这么多
I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.

655
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,830
师娘
Master...

656
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,370
徒弟十岁起就随你秘密练功
I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.

657
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,410
你给了我一个江湖的梦
You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.

658
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,950
可是有一天
But...

659
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,350
我发现我可以击败你
once I realized I could surpass you,

660
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,380
你不知道我心里有多害怕
I became so frightened!

661
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,860
我看不到天地的边
Everything fell apart.

662
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,080
不知道该往哪里去
I had no one to guide me,

663
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,260
我又能跟随谁？
no one to learn from.

664
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,100
你走上了这条道
Believe me,

665
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,600
怕的还在后面呢
I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

666
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,900
剑回来了，高兴吗？
The sword is back...Are you happy?

667
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,780
失而复得
I admit...

668
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,680
才知道对它还是有依恋
getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.

669
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,010
已经不是你的剑了
But it's not your sword anymore.

670
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,620
你不是说要送给贝勒爷吗？
You gave it to Sir Te.

671
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,460
是啊
True.

672
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,980
不过我恐怕还得再借用一回
But I must borrow it for one last mission.

673
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,560
你要让碧眼狐狸死在这把剑下
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

674
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,630
秀莲，你掩护那女孩儿的时候
Did you know what you were hiding...

675
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,530
知不知道她是谁？
when you covered for that girl?

676
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,700
我的责任是要把剑找回来
My job was to get the sword back,

677
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,500
还得顾及大家的颜面
without embarrassing anyone.

678
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,640
我若是把所知的都说出来
I wasn't about to ruin

679
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,320
不但毁了这位姑娘的一生
her life,

680
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,020
更要连累她爹
or her father's.

681
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,610
你事情处理得很漂亮
You did your job well.

682
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,010
剑也要回来了

683
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,320
只是…
But,

684
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,090
这女孩儿…昨夜我见着她了
this girl...I saw her last night.

685
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,590
我就知道你会疑心
I knew she would intrigue you.

686
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,290
她的心性需要约束
She needs direction...

687
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,360
武艺更需要导正和进一步的修练
and training.

688
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,770
她是官家的千金
She's an aristocrat's daughter.

689
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,740
不是我们这种江湖中人
She's not one of us.

690
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,000
慕白，这件事很快就会过去
In any case, it will all be over soon.

691
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,370
你会杀掉碧眼狐狸
You'll kill Fox,

692
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,770
她也会安安份份地去嫁人
and she'll marry.

693
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,210
她不是那种人
That's not for her.

694
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,870
她应该到武当山来做徒弟
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

695
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,650
武当山收女弟子吗？
But Wudan does not accept women.

696
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,050
为她…也许破个例吧
For her, they might make an exception.

697
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,020
如果不成，这姑娘…
If not, I'm afraid...

698
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,020
将来恐怕成为一条毒龙
she'll become a poisoned dragon.

699
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,500
这不关我们的事，她就要嫁人了
It's not our affair.

700
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,900
就算武当肯收她
Even if Wudan accepts her,

701
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,430
她丈夫…这位当朝的翰林
her husband might object.

702
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,030
恐怕也不会答应吧

703
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,630
唉！

704
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,230
交出了青冥剑
I thought by giving away the sword,

705
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,730
以为可以从此退出江湖
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

706
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,510
没想到又惹来了江湖上…
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

707
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,210
许多新仇旧恨

708
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,950
我也想过平静的日子
I wish there were something more

709
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,080
真不知道该怎么帮你
I could do to help you.

710
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,230
耐心点吧！秀莲
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

711
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,040
别动！

712
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,710
小虎？
Lo?

713
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,450
小龙
Jen!

714
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,030
你不该来找我
You shouldn't have come.

715
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,000
最近你们家的屋顶…
With all the traffic...

716
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,800
半夜里还真热闹
on your rooftop these days...

717
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,870
我好不容易才能进来
it took me a while to get in here.

718
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,840
我不能再等了，小龙
I can't wait any longer.

719
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,340
我错了，我不该让你走
I was wrong to let you go.

720
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,480
跟我回去，回新疆你就舒展了
Come back with me. You'll be happy in the desert.

721
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,740
想做什么就做什么
You'll be free there.

722
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,020
这些日子你一直在找我？
You've been looking for me all this time?

723
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,150
娇龙啊，别摆弄它了
Jen...Stop playing with it.

724
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,810
走这么久都没事
I won't break it.

725
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:03,940
停！

726
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,310
半天云
It's Dark Cloud!

727
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,680
半天云来啦
Dark Cloud is coming!

728
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,890
半天云来啦…

729
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,200
保护小姐及夫人
Dark Cloud is coming!

730
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,360
快把帘子放下来
Lower the shade,

731
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,700
别让他们看见你
don't let them see you!

732
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,260
不要害怕

733
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,150
不要碰女人
Don't touch the women!

734
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,590
我说不要碰女人

735
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,220
走！
Let's go!

736
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,070
来呀…

737
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,070
来拿梳子
Come get your comb.

738
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,920
喂

739
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,320
你的妈妈没事，快回去
Hurry back to your mother.

740
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,520
她是我的，让我来
She's mine! Leave her to me!

741
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,600
来，梳子在这儿
Come and get it!

742
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,330
还我梳子
Give me back my comb!

743
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,710
歇手！停一下
Let's stop a moment.

744
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,080
还我梳子
Give it back!

745
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,170
你累了，你要休息
You're tired. You need rest.

746
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,090
你的马要喝水了，前面有水
Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.

747
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,100
上次来还有水的
Well, there used to be!

748
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,990
你的名字？
What's your name?

749
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,370
我是罗小虎
I'm Lo.

750
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,970
汉人们都叫我“半天云”
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

751
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,010
我没有那么高，也没有那么大
I'm not that tall or big,

752
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,610
可是我很快
but I'm quick as lightning.

753
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:33,580
来

754
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,300
还我梳子
My comb!

755
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,160
你喜欢…
If you like that arrow,

756
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,160
我可以做一把小弓弩给你
I can make you a bow.

757
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,160
打猎很管用的
Great for hunting wild chicken.

758
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,400
香喷喷的呱啦鸡
They're delicious.

759
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,440
你要吃东西了，知道吗？
You need to eat. Understand?

760
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,980
吃过东西，有力气
Then you'll have the strength...

761
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,580
我们再打一打
to fight.

762
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,850
好吗？
Understand?

763
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,730
慢慢的才会有力气，不要急
You're eating too fast. Slowly.

764
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,060
你的脾气很不好，这样就好了
You've got quite a temper. It's better this way...

765
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,380
怕死就别装汉子
You coward!

766
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,140
你的脾气还是不好
Still in a bad mood?

767
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,080
不过你说话了，告诉我你的名字
At least you're speaking. What's your name?

768
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,020
呸！

769
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,930
呸？汉人没有这种名字的
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

770
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,700
别紧张
Relax.

771
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:11,730
我有你一半坏
If I had wanted to,

772
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,430
你现在就不是这样了
I would already have done it.

773
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,840
我知道你很想洗澡
You must be dying for a bath.

774
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,870
水源很远，路很难走
Fresh water's hard to get here.

775
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,150
我替你把水背来了
But I managed to bring some up.

776
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,780
洗好了，穿我的衣服
You can wear my clothes when you're done.

777
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,220
很干净的
They're clean.

778
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,640
放心
Don't worry.

779
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,270
你听我唱歌
I'll sing,

780
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,670
就知道我近了还是远了
so you'll know where I am.

781
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,240
等你洗好了，心情就好了
After the bath, you'll be calmer.

782
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,840
不可以再打人
No more hitting on the head!

783
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,290
为一把梳子，值得吗？
All this trouble for a comb?

784
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,850
那是我的
It's mine.

785
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,280
它对我来说很珍贵
It means a lot to me.

786
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,180
象你这样的土匪就没用
A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

787
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,400
不对，我可以用它挑马蚤
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.

788
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,000
告诉你，我是旗人
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

789
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,640
噢，你说的对
I'm sorry...

790
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,710
我猜错了，我以为你是汉人
I guessed wrong. I thought you were a Han.

791
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,910
把梳子还给我
Give me back my comb.

792
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,180
没有人可以命令我
I don't take orders from anyone.

793
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,500
给我
Give it back.

794
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,470
小的时候…
One night...

795
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,880
有一天夜里
when I was a boy,

796
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,780
我看见天上落下千万颗的星星
I saw a thousand shooting stars.

797
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,050
我想，它们都落到哪里去了？
I thought, "Where did they all go?"

798
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,920
我是个孤儿
I'm an orphan.

799
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,420
我就一个人去找星星
I used to look for stars alone.

800
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,790
我想，如果我骑马…
I thought if I rode...

801
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,290
到了沙漠的另一头
to the other end of the desert,

802
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:34,250
我就可以找到它的
I'd find them.

803
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,430
从那以后
I've been...

804
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,030
我就一直在大漠中奔驰
riding in the desert ever since.

805
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,660
后来小男孩儿变成了强盗
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.

806
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:45,510
星星找不到，就抢我的梳子
He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

807
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,010
在大漠中
Out here,

808
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,510
要活着，就要不断地拼杀
you always fight for survival.

809
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,340
大家要联合起来
You have to be part of a gang...

810
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,240
才有机会活下去
to stand a chance.

811
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,850
你的同伴就成了自己的家
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

812
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,190
那个“半天云”的名字…
All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people

813
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,130
只是一个让人更容易活下去的迷
and make my life easier.

814
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,030
所以你在心里头还是个小男孩儿
So you are still that little boy

815
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,030
在寻找那些流星？
looking for shooting stars.

816
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,740
我是一个男人了
I am a man.

817
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,570
而且…
And now...

818
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,170
我已经找到最亮的一颗星了
I've found the brightest star of all.

819
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,500
你爸爸的人在找你
Your father's men are looking for you.

820
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,430
你爸爸还在找你
They're still out there, circling closer.

821
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:19,730
让他们找吧
Let them look.

822
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,440
他们找来找去，是我的麻烦
It is trouble for me.

823
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,970
你别送我回去
Don't send me back.

824
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,510
你自己决定吧
You must decide.

825
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,550
也许以后你会很烦，会不习惯…
You might get tired of this life.

826
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,320
你会想你的爸爸，想你的妈妈
You might begin to miss your family.

827
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,490
如果我们有一个女儿不见了
If it were our daughter,

828
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,090
我们也会找的
we'd look for her too.

829
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,290
我们的女儿也会想我们的
She would miss us.

830
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,000
小龙
Jen...

831
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,240
我要你做我的女人
I want you to be mine forever.

832
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,240
我一定会干一番事业
I will make my mark on the world.

833
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:01,400
让你的爸爸妈妈，看得起我
I will earn your parents respect.

834
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,440
我们有一个传说…
We have a legend.

835
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:07,040
如果谁敢从那个山上跳下来
Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain,

836
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,280
天神就会满足他一个愿望
God will grant his wish.

837
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,120
很久以前有一个人，父母病了…
Long ago, a young man's parents were ill,

838
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,260
他就从山上跳下去
so he jumped.

839
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,260
结果他没有死，一点伤都没有
He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt.

840
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,460
后来他漂泊到一个地方去
He floated away, far away,

841
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,860
再也没有回来
never to return.

842
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,130
他知道他的愿望实现了
He knew his wish had come true.

843
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,230
真心的，就会实现
If you believe, it will happen.

844
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,400
我问过老人们，他们说是…
The elders say,

845
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,810
心诚则灵
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true".

846
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,430
把它保存好
Keep it safe.

847
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,730
等我们重新相聚的时候
Return it to me...

848
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,130
再还给我
when we are together again.

849
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,830
我会
I will.

850
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:07,270
如果你不还我，我会追到你
If you don't, I'll come after you.

851
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,780
下一次我可不会对你这么客气了
And I won't let you off so easy.

852
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:24,260
可是我每前进一步
Wherever I went...

853
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,360
就有人认出我来
someone always recognized me.

854
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,320
我真的尽了力
I really tried.

855
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,660
我听说你们去了北京
Later, I heard you came to Peking.

856
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,670
我怕再也见不到你了
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

857
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,340
所以我就来了
So I came.

858
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,870
我不能让你嫁人
I can't let you marry.

859
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,450
你回去吧
Go.

860
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,480
小龙…
Jen...

861
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:53,150
永远永远不要回来
Don't ever come back.

862
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:54,720
就这样？
So it's over?

863
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,930
就这样
Yes.

864
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,800
小姐，好象有什么动静吧？
We heard noises.

865
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,320
没有，是猫
It was just a cat.

866
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,370
你想碧眼狐狸会出现吗？
You think Jade Fox will show up?

867
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,630
她一定在附近盯着
She's out there,

868
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,740
我料她不至于傻到让人发现
but I doubt she'll show herself.

869
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,570
我们得留神
We'll keep our eyes open.

870
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,700
她迟早会想法子…
Sooner or later,

871
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,800
回到她的主子身边
she'll come for the girl.

872
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,660
小龙！
Jen!

873
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,800
小龙
Jen!

874
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:20,610
小龙，跟我回新疆
Jen! Come with me!

875
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,710
什么人？

876
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,180
不要拉我，放开我…

877
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,020
让开

878
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,190
小龙

879
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,150
没有人可以娶你

880
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:37,490
你是我的，跟我回新疆
You're mine! Come with me to the desert!

881
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:53,680
小龙，跟我回新疆
Jen! Come with me to Xin Jiang!

882
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,750
快告诉我！碧眼狐狸在哪里？
Tell me. Where is Jade Fox?

883
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,750
跟我来，快走！
Come with me. Hurry!

884
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,550
你真以为她会抛下一切…
You thought she'd give it all up...

885
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,050
跟你回新疆吗？
and go back West with you?

886
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,760
她是我的
She's mine.

887
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,330
不论她是不是你的…
Either way,

888
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,060
你没有命，说什么也没用
you are no good to her dead.

889
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,090
有鲁家跟玉家的势力盯着你
With the Gou and Yu clans

890
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,870
要抓你这个外地人，是很快的事
hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands.

891
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,700
豁出去了
I don't care anymore.

892
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,680
如果你真的爱她，你不会这样说
If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that.

893
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:34,310
你难道不想再见娇龙一面吗？
Don't you want to see her again?

894
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:37,620
好吧
All right.

895
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,880
我手书一封，你带去武当山
I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan.

896
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,880
在那等我消息
Wait there for news from me.

897
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,960
好吧
All right.

898
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,040
唉！看来这江湖恩怨未了
When will this end?

899
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,170
想拿就拿，想还就还
They take it, they put it back, they take it again.

900
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,140
我这里连外城的库房都不如
My home is turning into a warehouse.

901
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,550
进来
Come in.

902
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:08,550
讲
Speak!

903
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,980
玉娇龙离家出走
Jen has run away!

904
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,450
听说鲁爷入洞房的时候
Gou found...

905
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,650
新娘子不见了
the wedding chamber empty.

906
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:13,880
玉府想探贝勒爷个信儿
Governor Yu requests your assistance.

907
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,580
是不是愿意帮着寻找一下

908
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,220
说是贝勒爷江湖上认识人多…
You know the Giang Hu underworld.

909
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,130
传个话出去，一是容易找到
He wants to find her,

910
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:21,130
二是别出什么事儿
and keep her from harm.

911
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,260
贝勒爷，这事就交给我们
Sir Te, leave this to us.

912
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,060
不劳您费心
Don't worry.

913
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,890
侍候点什么？
What can I serve you?

914
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,620
怎么这么脏？
This cup is dirty.

915
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,610
打扰了
Hello.

916
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,040
敢问尊姓大名，怎么称呼啊？
What's your name?

917
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,940
姓龙
Long.

918
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,980
原来是龙少侠，失敬…
It's young Master Long. My apologies!

919
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,850
在下“冀东铁鹰爪”宋明
I'm Iron Eagle Sung

920
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:23,390
这位是我师哥“飞天豹”李云
and this is my brother in arms, Flying Cougar Li Yun.

921
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,290
不知道龙少侠途径怀安…
What brings you to Huai An,

922
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:27,690
要到哪儿去啊？
and where are you headed, Master Long?

923
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,260
哪儿好玩儿去哪儿
Anywhere there's action.

924
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:33,430
人生地不熟，我们哥儿俩…
In that case,

925
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,030
帮你调查调查地面儿
perhaps we could be of assistance.

926
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,930
用不着你们操心
Don't bother.

927
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,140
这位是真不懂是假不懂啊
You don't seem to understand.

928
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,380
不懂怎么着？
So what if I don't?

929
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,210
不懂有不懂的规矩
We have ways of helping you to understand.

930
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,160
敢问少侠跟武当派的李慕白是…
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

931
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,130
手下败将
He is my defeated foe!

932
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,760
喝杯茶吧
Have some tea.

933
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,380
秀莲
Shu Lien...

934
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,820
我们能触摸的东西没有“永远”
The things we touch have no permanence.

935
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,860
师父一再的说…
My master would say...

936
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,360
把手握紧，里面什么也没有
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.

937
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,090
把手松开，你拥有的是一切
Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.

938
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:14,670
慕白

939
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:15,840
这世间…

940
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,340
不是每一件事都是虚幻的
Not everything is an illusion.

941
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,000
刚才你握着我的手
My hand...

942
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:22,400
你能感觉到它的真实吗？
wasn't that real?

943
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,710
你的手冰凉凉的
Your hand, rough...

944
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:29,050
那些练刀练出来的硬茧…
and callused from practice...

945
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,190
每一次我看见，都不敢触摸
All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

946
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,520
秀莲

947
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,190
江湖里卧虎藏龙…
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons,

948
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,660
人心里何尝不是？
full of corruption...

949
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,560
刀剑里藏凶…

950
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,870
人情里何尝不是？

951
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,170
我诚心诚意的把青冥剑交出来
I tried sincerely to give it up

952
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,400
却带给我们更多的烦恼
but I have brought us only trouble.

953
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,170
压抑只会让感情更强烈
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

954
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,140
我也阻止不了我的欲望
You're right, but I don't know what to do.

955
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,750
我想跟你在一起
I want to be with you...

956
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,180
就象这样坐着
just like this.

957
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,790
我反而能感觉到一种平静
It gives me a sense of peace.

958
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,110
客官里边请
Please follow me.

959
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,510
要间干净的房
I want a clean room.

960
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,920
房间有的是
We have plenty.

961
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:36,680
客官，吃点什么？
Your order?

962
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,880
花雕蒸鳜鱼、干炸头号里脊
Steamed whole cod,

963
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,650
溜丸子
bite-size meatballs,

964
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,350
丸子小一点，芡粉少一点
a little starchy, but keep the sauce light,

965
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,050
再来一个翅子白菜汤
shark fin soup,

966
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:44,650
二两玫瑰露，温过
mixed vegetables, and some warm wine.

967
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,160
客官，这得等

968
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:47,960
这要到大馆子才有
I have to order from a bigger restaurant.

969
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,200
那就快去呀
Hurry then.

970
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,670
就是他
That's him.

971
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:45,010
在下“铁臂神拳”米大彪
I am Iron Arm Mi.

972
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:45,990
路过此地

973
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,420
听闻有高人在此
I heard a true master has arrived.

974
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,120
特来请教
I have come to seek a lesson.

975
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,130
那在下就失礼了
You asked for it!

976
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,560
哼！什么铁臂神拳
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

977
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,240
好厉害的点穴法
You have amazing technique!

978
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,850
在下“花影无踪”飞刀常
I am Flying Saber.

979
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,720
敢问这位与江南鹤可曾认识？
Are you related to Southern Crane?

980
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,150
什么鸡鸭鹤？
Southern Duck?

981
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,150
我从来不吃两只脚的东西
I don't eat anything with two feet.

982
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,560
你们名字也太罗嗦，谁记得住
Who could remember such long-winded names?

983
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,920
你…

984
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,190
你说李慕白是你的手下败将
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,

985
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:02,000
怎么不知道江南鹤是他师父？
and you don't know his master Southern Crane?

986
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,400
你是哪儿的？
Who are you?

987
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:10,100
在下“凤阳山魁星五手”鲁君雄
I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

988
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,410
鲁君雄…好个鲁君雄
Gou? I hate that name.

989
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,280
我听到你的名字就想吐
It makes me puke!

990
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,680
你活该倒霉姓“鲁”
Too bad you're named Gou.

991
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:21,740
要比划就先拿你开刀
You'll be the first to feel my sword today.

992
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,000
住手
Hold it!

993
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:48,210
你可认得江南静玄禅师？
Don't you know Monk Jing?

994
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,280
和尚不念经…
A monk, in a place like this?

995
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,980
跑到这里开荤也该教训
You need a lesson!

996
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,620
你到底是何人？
Who are you?

997
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,350
我呀…
Who am I?

998
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:56,880
我乃是…
I am...

999
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,590
他手里有宝剑
I am the Invincible Sword Goddess.

1000
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,360
我乃是潇洒人间一剑仙
Armed with the incredible...

1001
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:09,590
青冥宝剑胜龙泉
Green Destiny.

1002
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:18,600
任凭李俞江南鹤
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

1003
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:22,440
都要低头求我怜
lower your head and ask for mercy.

1004
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,420
沙漠飞来一条龙
I am the desert dragon.

1005
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:43,870
神来无影去无踪
I leave no trace.

1006
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:57,440
今朝踏破峨嵋顶
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

1007
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:04,680
明日拔去武当峰
Tomorrow I'll kick over Wudan Mountain!

1008
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,440
好言好语跟他请教
We politely asked for a friendly match,

1009
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,940
他是一点儿规矩也没有
but she showed no respect,

1010
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,510
出口伤人，出手伤人
and attacked us.

1011
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,380
道上兄弟都往这儿赶哪
Everyone came by...

1012
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,110
要教训这没规矩的小子
to teach her a lesson.

1013
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,440
他的剑实在厉害
Her sword was just too powerful.

1014
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,820
我游方四海
I've traveled everywhere,

1015
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,120
从未见过如此无理之人
but never met anyone so uncivilized.

1016
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,420
他硬说，我和他的仇家…
She kept accusing me...

1017
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,420
“鲁君佩”是兄弟
of being Gou Jun Pei's brother.

1018
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,650
这鲁君佩到底是什么人哪？
Who is this Gou, anyway?

1019
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,360
是她丈夫
Her husband.

1020
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,620
是她丈夫啊…

1021
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,800
镖局离这儿不远
We're close to your headquarters.

1022
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,840
是不是要回家看一看？
Go home and check in.

1023
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,140
你们呢？
What about you?

1024
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,550
我到附近打听一下，随后就来
I'll look around and catch up later.

1025
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,750
也好
Not a bad idea.

1026
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,710
我们今晚就在雄远镖局落脚
Tonight we'll get...

1027
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,640
先睡个好觉吧
a good night's sleep at headquarters.

1028
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,850
好

1029
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,650
头儿回来啦
Mistress, you're back.

1030
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,420
哟！头儿回来啦
It's you!

1031
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:47,290
你们几个…家里都好吧？
How is everything here?

1032
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,000
都安在…
Fine.

1033
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,020
大姐这一去怎么去那么久？
You've been gone a while.

1034
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,650
事儿赶事儿！还得走
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

1035
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,820
阿伟，老婆生了？
Your wife was due?

1036
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,830
生了个丫头
Yeah, a baby girl.

1037
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:54,760
丫头好啊
Good!

1038
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,100
能有大姐一个脚趾头，就知足了
I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you.

1039
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,360
吴妈
Mrs. Wu...

1040
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:01,400
你回来啦
You're back!

1041
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,530
膀子还疼不疼？
How's the arm? Still sore?

1042
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,740
好多了
Much better.

1043
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,830
那好

1044
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,300
怎么这一次这么久才回来呀
You've been gone so long.

1045
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,940
吴妈，慕白今晚会来小住
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

1046
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,210
我马上给他收拾房间
I'll go and make up his room!

1047
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,810
俞姐姐
Sister Shu Lien...

1048
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,220
既然是找我，就得有个样子
Here you must be in proper attire.

1049
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,720
我只不过是求个干净衣裳
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.

1050
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,720
又不是来做客
I'm not staying.

1051
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:04,300
你本事挺大的，不必我给你吧
I'll give them to you.

1052
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,800
我也只是路过，想看看你，你…
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

1053
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,210
姐…
You, sister...

1054
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,750
好了，祸也闯了
Look at the trouble you've caused.

1055
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,610
也知道，道上是怎么回事了
Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.

1056
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:21,550
你来…

1057
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,750
就是你心里真有我这个姐姐
If you think of me as your sister,

1058
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:27,420
既然是这样，道理得说清楚
let me give you some sisterly advice.

1059
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:30,760
可以不嫁，父母不能丢下
You can run from marriage, but not your parents.

1060
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,420
就是他们让我嫁的
They forced me to marry!

1061
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,490
先让爹娘放心
Go back to them first.

1062
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:39,270
你与小虎的事，再看着办
Then you can decide about Lo.

1063
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:41,840
你知道罗小虎…
You know about Lo?

1064
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,650
他是一片真心
He really loves you.

1065
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,850
你们俩的事还有商量

1066
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,540
歇一下，跟我回北京
Come back to Peking with me.

1067
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,580
没有商量不成的事
We'll find a solution.

1068
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,920
他在哪里？
Where is he now?

1069
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,120
李慕白已经安排了
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

1070
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:09,130
李慕白？

1071
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,060
李慕白让他去武当山了
He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

1072
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,270
你们都是一起的
You're working together to set me up!

1073
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,970
给我下套儿…我走
I'm leaving!

1074
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,440
娇龙，闭嘴，你凭什么骂人
How dare you accuse us!

1075
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,140
从一开始…
I always knew...

1076
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,040
我就知道是你拿了青冥剑
you had stolen the sword!

1077
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,070
我一路替你隐瞒
I've done nothing...

1078
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:23,670
护着你和你的家人
but protect you and your family.

1079
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,580
你除了蔑视我
And you've repaid me with nothing...

1080
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:25,980
你拿什么来报答？
but contempt.

1081
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,490
李慕白没有惩罚你
Li Mu Bai himself spared you,

1082
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,290
你反而一再恶言挑衅
and all you do is insult him.

1083
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,380
我们祈求的一点平静…
We wanted some peace...

1084
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,580
都教你给毁了，你还不甘心？
and you've ruined it all!

1085
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,650
这样的姊妹，不要也罢
You're no sister of mine!

1086
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,390
我不在乎
What do I care?

1087
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,290
朋友本来就是假的
You were never a real friend anyway.

1088
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,230
只不过我怀疑…
But I wonder...

1089
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,930
做我的敌人你能撑多久
how long could you last as my enemy?

1090
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,410
把剑放下
Put the sword down!

1091
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,980
上面有人，什么人…抓起来

1092
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:02,110
娇龙
Jen!

1093
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,850
通通出去，把门关上
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

1094
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,000
好，说翻脸就翻脸
Fine... the friendship is over.

1095
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,400
不准摸
Don't touch it!

1096
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,360
那是李慕白的剑
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

1097
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,470
有本事来拿
Come and get it if you can.

1098
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,740
有本事就别用宝剑
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.

1099
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:48,540
哼！打不赢怪兵器不好
Don't be a sore loser.

1100
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:55,410
去啊！随便挑
Go ahead. Take your pick.

1101
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,380
我等着你
I'll wait.

1102
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:00,820
去啊
Go ahead.

1103
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,180
把剑给我
Give me the sword.

1104
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:00,740
拿去
Take it!

1105
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:06,180
住手
Stop it!

1106
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,760
你不配用这把剑
You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

1107
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:14,360
又来个教训人的，看剑
Not another lecture! On guard!

1108
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,670
到此为止
Let's end this here.

1109
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,830
从今以后我认剑不认人
Only the sword will settle this.

1110
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,070
当日古寺留一步给你
I only let you go...

1111
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,270
是要见你的本心
because I wanted to see the real you.

1112
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:07,440
你们这些老江湖
What do you know...

1113
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:09,040
怎么见得到本心
about a true heart?

1114
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,690
为什么非要缠着我？
What do you want?

1115
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:55,420
还是那句话，我来教你心诀
What I've always wanted, to teach you.

1116
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,990
好吧
All right.

1117
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,690
三招之内你能拿回青冥剑…
If you can take back the sword in three moves,

1118
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,560
我就跟你走
I'll go with you.

1119
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,200
剑还我
Give it back!

1120
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,270
拜师
Kneel!

1121
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,470
做梦
Never!

1122
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,740
那剑就没有了
Then you have no use for the sword.

1123
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,050
我知道那帮人…
Sooner or later...

1124
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,050
早晚会把你逮回去的
they'd drag you back to Peking.

1125
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:04,290
你爹娘是要面子的人
Your parents...

1126
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,290
哪能容你再进家门
will never accept you again.

1127
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:10,950
家有什么好？
But why go home?

1128
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,630
既然出来了，我们就到处走走
We've gone this far, we won't stop now.

1129
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,090
你还是我的千金小姐
You'll always be my Lady.

1130
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:23,040
人生一世，不就图个痛快？
At last, we'll be our own masters.

1131
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:25,250
这下子好了
We'll be happy.

1132
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,300
我们可以做自己的主啊
That's the most important thing.

1133
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:29,710
你我都是自己唯一的亲人
All we have left is each other, right?

1134
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,450
快躺下…别乱动
Lie down and rest.

1135
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:02,270
这样儿的姑娘，杀了算了
She's crazy. You should have killed her.

1136
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:04,240
下不去手
I didn't have the heart.

1137
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,840
慕白啊，也许能下得了手
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

1138
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,550
你要剑…还是要我？
Is it me or the sword you want?

1139
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,640
你中了迷香
You've been drugged.

1140
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,690
碧眼狐狸在哪里？
Where is Jade Fox?

1141
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,340
怎么了
What happened?

1142
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,940
碧眼狐狸给她施了迷香
Jade Fox drugged her.

1143
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,820
你们怎么来的？
How did you get here?

1144
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,980
碧眼狐狸往这边走，我们跟来的
We followed Jade Fox.

1145
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,620
小心

1146
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:11,560
师娘

1147
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:28,610
你的路已经到了尽头
And so you die.

1148
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:32,110
你也一样
And so shall you!

1149
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,000
是毒针
A poisoned needle!

1150
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,490
虽然你死也不冤
You deserve to die,

1151
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,610
徒儿不肖…我要的是玉娇龙的命
but the life I was hoping to take...was Jen's.

1152
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:58,270
十年苦心
Ten years I devoted to you.

1153
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,410
就是因为你一肚子的坏水
But you deceived me!

1154
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:03,750
隐藏心诀…
You hid the manual's true meaning.

1155
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:06,120
让我苦练不成
I never improved...

1156
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:10,950
而你…却是剑艺精进
but your progress was limitless!

1157
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,330
什么是毒？
You know what poison is?

1158
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:18,700
一个八岁的孩子就有这种心机…
An eight-year-old girl, full of deceit.

1159
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,430
这就是毒
That's poison!

1160
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:25,840
娇龙…
Jen!

1161
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,640
我唯一的亲…
My only family...

1162
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,410
唯一的仇！
my only enemy...

1163
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:42,690
你不能死
You can't die!

1164
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,750
告诉我，你用的是什么毒？
Tell us what poison you used!

1165
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,450
什么毒…

1166
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:48,500
你不能死
You can't die!

1167
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,860
解方是什么？
Tell us the antidote!

1168
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:52,730
你不能让他死，李慕白不能死
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

1169
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:54,300
是九转紫阴针
She used Purple Yin...

1170
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,400
什么？

1171
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:59,340
紫阴针…毒走心脉…
Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.

1172
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,170
一个时辰之后

1173
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:06,170
静脉的血，就会开始倒流
My blood will soon reverse its flow.

1174
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:08,440
我师父江南鹤…
It's the same poison

1175
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,940
就是送命在紫阴针下
she used to kill my master.

1176
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:13,720
这毒没解的
There is no antidote.

1177
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:15,890
一定有解，一定能解
That can't be!

1178
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,350
相生相克
Everything has an antithesis!

1179
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,150
一物…

1180
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,350
怎么可能一物不能克一物
Why not this?

1181
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:21,860
我知道解方
The antidote exists.

1182
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:24,300
是从师娘那儿知道的
She taught it to me.

1183
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,400
其实药方并不难
The formula is simple,

1184
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,200
只是很不容易配
but it takes time...

1185
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:28,870
需要时间
to prepare.

1186
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:36,550
相信我
Trust me.

1187
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,540
你们救了我
As you have helped me,

1188
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:41,710
让我救他吧
let me help him.

1189
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:45,820
好吧，你快去
All right. Hurry.

1190
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,650
以我的内力，顶多只有一个对时
I will hold on as long as I can.

1191
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:51,060
骑我的马去，镖局里药材不少
Take my horse and go to the compound.

1192
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:53,990
给吴妈看这个，她会帮你，快去！
Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!

1193
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,060
守住真气，我一定回来
Spare your energy. I'll be back!

1194
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,060
有人闯进来啦

1195
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:29,690
吴妈…
Where is Mrs. Wu?

1196
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,830
住手
Stop it!

1197
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:34,930
这是俞姐的，俞姐叫我来的
Shu Lien told me to show you this.

1198
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,600
让她进来
Let her in.

1199
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,820
慕白，守住气
Mu Bai, hold on.

1200
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,490
给我一点希望
Give me some hope.

1201
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:26,820
秀莲
Shu Lien...

1202
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:29,760
别动气
Save your strength.

1203
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,690
生命已经到了尽头
My life is departing.

1204
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,430
我只有一息尚存
I've only one breath left.

1205
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:43,430
用这口气，练神还虚吧
Use it to meditate.

1206
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:46,060
解脱得道、元寂永恒
Free yourself from this world

1207
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:48,860
一直是武当修练的愿望
as you have been taught.

1208
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,510
提升这一口气
Let your soul rise to eternity

1209
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:54,710
到达你这一生追求的境地
with your last breath.

1210
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:59,880
别放下、浪费在我身上
Do not waste it for me.

1211
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:05,020
我已经浪费了这一生
I've already wasted my whole life.

1212
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:09,260
我要用这口气对你说…
I want to tell you with my last breath...

1213
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:13,830
我一直深爱着你！
I have always loved you.

1214
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,030
我宁愿游荡在你身边…
I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side...

1215
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,070
做七天的野鬼…
as a condemned soul...

1216
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:56,770
跟随你

1217
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:03,280
就算落进最黑暗的地方
than enter heaven without you.

1218
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,120
我的爱…
Because of your love...

1219
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:14,560
也不会让我成为永远的孤魂
I will never be a lonely spirit.

1220
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:11,750
他走了？
He's gone?

1221
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,620
刘师傅
Bo...

1222
01:51:43,290 --> 01:51:46,020
剑就托你送还贝勒府
please take this sword back to Sir Te.

1223
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:54,760
去武当山
Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.

1224
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,760
小虎在那里等着你
Lo awaits you there.

1225
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:00,200
答应我
Promise me one thing.

1226
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:03,670
不论你对此生的决定为何…
Whatever path you take in this life...

1227
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:06,800
一定要真诚的对待自己
be true to yourself.

1228
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:55,120
小龙

1229
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,250
小龙

1230
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:02,890
还记得你说的那个故事吗？
Do you remember the legend of the young man?

1231
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,330
心诚则灵
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

1232
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:16,640
许个愿吧，小虎
Make a wish, Lo.

1233
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,080
一起回新疆！
To be back in the desert, together again.
