It's all right, dear. It didn't spill.

117
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
我才不在乎它洒没洒
I don't care if it spilled or not.

118
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,200
就算我淹死在里边我也不在乎！
I don't care if I drowned in it!

119
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,660
亲爱的 你病了
My dear, you're ill.

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,830
我派人去把博纳科温医生请来
I'll send for Dr. Bonnachoven.

121
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,340
我不要博纳科温医生！就让我安静的死掉吧
I don't want Dr. Bonnachoven! Please let me die in peace.

122
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
你不会死的
You're not dying.

123
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,800
别管我！
Leave me!

124
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,630
- 别管我！
- 你就是有些紧张了 控制你的情绪 安
- Leave me!
- It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

125
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
我不要！
I don't want to!

126
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,390
公主殿下！
Your Highness!

127
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,600
我去把博纳科温医生找来
I'll get Dr. Bonnachoven.

128
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,100
这没用的
It's no use.

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,100
在他赶到这里前我就会死掉
I'll be dead before he gets here.

130
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,150
她已经睡着了
She's asleep.

131
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
3分钟前她还是歇斯底里的 医生
She was in hysterics three minutes ago, Doctor.

132
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,410
您睡着了吗 殿下？
Are you asleep, ma'am?

133
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,540
没有！
No!

134
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,420
我只打扰您一小会儿 公主殿下
I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness a moment.

135
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
我真的很惭愧 博纳科温医生
I'm very ashamed, Dr. Bonnachoven.

136
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,170
突然间 我就哭起来了
Sudenly, I was crying.

137
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,220
哭 是再平常不过的事了
To cry, a perfectly normal thing to do.

138
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,930
最重要的是让她在出席记者招待会的时候能够冷静 放松 医生
It's most important she be calm and relaxed for the press conference, Doctor.

139
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,810
别担心 医生
Don't worry, Doctor.

140
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,640
我会冷静 放松的
I'll be calm and relaxed.

141
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,810
我会欠身 微笑的
I'll bow, and I'll smile.

142
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,390
我会改善贸易关系 还有...
I'll improve trade relations, and...

143
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,690
她又这样了 给她点儿什么药 医生 快点
There she goes again. Give her something, Doctor, please.

144
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,400
请把她的衣袖卷起来
<font color=#FF7F00>[请注意将军的表演]</font>
Uncover her arm, please.

145
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,610
那是什么？
What's that?

146
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,160
镇定促睡眠的药
Sleep and calm.

147
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
这会让公主殿下您感到放松并感到些许愉快的
This will relax you and make Your Highness feel a little happy.

148
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,490
这是一种新药 没有任何副作用
It's a new drug, quite harmless.

149
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,500
好了
There.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,130
我没感觉有什么不同
I don't feel any different.

151
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,510
你会的 要过一阵才会起效
You will. It may take a little time to take hold.

152
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,880
现在 快躺下吧
Just, now, lie back.

153
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,550
能给我留一盏灯别关 好吗？
Can I keep just one light on?

154
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,010
当然可以
Of course.

155
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,850
我最懂得的就是遵照您的心意了
Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while.

156
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,350
谢谢您 医生
Thank you, Doctor.

157
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,070
噢 将军他！医生 快来！

You're much too young to get picked up by the police.

204
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,400

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,910
要知道 酒量不行的人就不该喝酒
You know, people who can't handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

207
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,290
“若是我死去 眠于地下 但只要听见你的声音”
"If I were dead and buried and I heard your voice

213

你不介意做个解释吧？

214
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,600
这个世界需要的是让甜美和庄重重新回归到
What the world needs is a return to sweetness and decency

215
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,230

1,000里拉

1 2 3 4千
One, two, three, four mille.

252
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,280
好了

254

好的 好的 现在 听我说
Okay, okay. Now, look.

255
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,040
- 拿上这些钱...
- 嗯？
- Take a little bit of that...
- Yeah?

256
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,790
她想去哪儿就把她送到什么地方去
Take her wherever she wants to go.

257
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,500
晚安
Good night.

258
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:44,593
噢 不行 不行 等等 等等
Oh, No, no, moument, moument.

259
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,300
- 不行 不行 不行 不行

- No, no, no, no.
- All right, look.

260
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,180
你看 等她醒了
As soon as she wakes up, see,

261
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,220
她就会告诉你她要去什么地方 对吧？
she'll tell you where she wants to go, okay?

262
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,640
等等 等等 我的出租车可不是让人睡觉的
Moument, moument. My taxi is not for sleep.

263
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,230
我的出租车 不是睡觉用的 明白吗？你明白吗？
My taxi. No sleep. Understand? You understand?

264
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,110
听着 朋友 这不关我的事 明白吗？
Look, pal. This is not my problem, see?

265
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,320
我之前从没见过她 好吗
I never see her before. Okay.

266
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,110
这不关你的事 也不关我的事
Is not your problem. Is not my problem.

267
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,910
你想怎样？你不想要女孩儿 对吧？<font color=#FF7F00>[意式英语 凑合翻译]</font>
What you want? You don't want girl, yeah?

268
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,910
我不想要女孩儿
Me don't want girl.

269
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,450
警察！也许她会想要女孩儿
Police! Maybe she want girl.

270
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,000
好吧 好吧 好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,920
真开心...真开心...
So happy... So happy...

272
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,020
我该去做下头部检查了
I ought to have my head examined.

273
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,570
这是电梯吗？
Is this the elevator?

274
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,410
这是我的房间
It's my room.

275
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,790
非常抱歉我这样说起它 不过我晕得越来越厉害了
I'm terribly sorry to mention it, but the dizziness is getting worse.

276
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,000
我可以睡在这里吗？
Can I sleep here?

277
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,710
那是当然的
That's the general idea.

278
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,590
能给我件缀着玫瑰花的丝绸睡袍吗？
Can I have a silk nightgown with rosebuds on it?

279
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,800
我恐怕你今晚要将就一下了 穿上这些吧
I'm afraid you'll have to rough it tonight, in these.

280
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,970
睡衣！
Pajamas!

281
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,480
抱歉 亲爱的 可我不穿睡袍已经好多年了
Sorry, honey, but I haven't worn a nightgown in years.

282
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,480
你能替我宽衣吗 谢谢？
Will you help me get undressed, please?

283
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,440
好吧
Okay.

284
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,540
给你 剩下的你自己来吧
There you are. You can handle the rest.

285
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,800
我可以喝点儿吗？
May I have some?

286
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,180
不行
No.

287
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,350
好了 听着...
Now, look...

288
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,350
这很不寻常
This is very unusual.

289
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,690
我之前从未同一个男人独处过
I've never been alone with a man before,

290
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,690
即便是穿着衣服
even with my dress on.

291
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,990
现在连衣服都没穿 这太不寻常了
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

292
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,780
我不会介意的
I don't seem to mind.

293
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,160
你呢？
Do you?

294
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,330
我想我要出去喝杯咖啡
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

295
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
你还是快点儿睡觉吧
You'd better get to sleep.

296
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,750
不 睡这上边
No. On this one.

297
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,050
真是太体贴了
So terribly nice.

298
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,067
听着
Here.

299
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,140
这些是睡衣 穿上它们睡觉
These are pajamas. They're to sleep in.

300
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,550
你要爬进睡衣里去 明白吗？
You're to climb into them. You understand?

301
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
谢谢
Thank you.

302
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,560
你要睡在躺椅上 明白吗 不是床上
And you do your sleeping on the couch, see, not on the bed.

303
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,060
不是椅子上 是躺椅上 听明白了吗？
Not on the chair, on the couch. Is that clear?

304
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,850
你知道我最喜欢的那首诗吗？
Do you know my favorite poem?

305
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,730
你已经念给我听过了
You've already recited that for me.

306
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:53,570

307

- Keats.
- Shelley.

308
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,290
别想什么诗了 穿上睡衣吧
You just keep your mind off the poetry and on the pajamas.

309
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,370
一切都会好起来的 明白吗？
Everything'll be all right, see?

310
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,790
- 是基茨的
- 好了 我...
- It's Keats.
- Now, I'll be...

311
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,920
是雪莱的 我大约10分钟后回来
It's Shelley. I'll be back in about 10 minutes.

312
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,210
基茨
Keats.

313
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,340
我准你退下了
You have my permission to withdraw.

314
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,260
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

315
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,600
- 怎么样？
- 没有任何踪迹 阁下
- Well?
- No trace, Your Excellency.

316
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,940
庭院里你搜过了吗？
Have you searched the grounds?

317
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,190
每英寸都搜过了 长官 从阁楼到地下室都搜过了
Every inch, sir, from the attics to the cellar.

318
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,990
我要你用自己的名誉担保不把这事告诉任何人
I must put you on your honor not to speak of this to anyone.

319
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,410
我必须提醒你公主是王位的第一顺位继承人
I must remind you that the princess is the direct heir to the throne.

320
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,080
这件事必须保持绝密
This must be classified as top crisis secret.

321
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,450
- 你能向我保证吗？
- 是的 长官
- Have I your pledge?
- Yes, sir.

322
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,870
非常好
Very well.

323
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,960
现在我必须通知国王及王后
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

324
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,100
噢

你在找我吗？
You've been looking for me?

342
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,830
刚才来上班？
Just coming to work?

343
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,200

Who, me?

344
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,830
我们这里是8:30上班
We start our days at 8:30 in this office.

345
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,960
我们要完成分配的任务...
We pick up our assignments...

346
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,170
我的任务昨晚就完成了
I picked mine up last night.

347
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,050
- 你指的那个任务？
- 公主的 11:45的那个
- What assignment was that?
- The princess. 11:45.

348
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,630
你已经采访过了？
You've already been to the interview?

349
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,590
当然 我刚回来
Sure. I just got back.

350
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,770
- 好吧 好吧 好吧 算我错怪你了
- 没事
- Well, well, well, all my apologies.
- It's all right.

351
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,770
- 采访很有趣吧
- 算不上 跟往常一样吧
- This is very interesting.
- No, just routine.

352
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,310
告诉我 告诉我 她回答了采访单上的全部问题吗？
Tell me, tell me, did she answer all the questions on the list?

353
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,940
噢 当然她都回答了 我把它们放在这里或者别的什么地方了
Well, of course she did. I've got them right here somewhere.

354
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,860
你用不着忙活了 我这里就有一份副本
Don't disturb yourself. I have a copy here.

355
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,530
公主殿下对建立欧洲联盟有何看法？
How did Her Highness react to the idea of a European federation?

356
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,530
她认为还不错
She thought it was just fine.

357
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,200
是吗？
She did?

358
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,500
嗯 她认为这将产生两方面的影响
Well, she thought that there'd be two effects.

359
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
两方面？
Two?

360
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,580
直接还有间接的影响
The direct and the indirect.

361
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,170
说得真不错
Remarkable.

362
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,670
当然 她认为间接影响没有直接影响来得那么直接
Naturally, she thought that the indirect would not be as direct as the direct.

363
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,260
- 就是说 来得没有那么快
- 不 不 不 不
- That is, not right away.
- No, no, no, no.

364
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,050
当然 要过段时间 噢 谁知道呢
Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

365
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,730
噢 噢 噢 这说法很老练啊
Well, well, well, that was a shrewd observation.

366
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,060
他们在耍你 知道吗 这些皇室的小家伙们
They fool you, you know, these royal kids.

367
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
他们可不像我们想的那样只会在舞会上跳舞
They've got a lot more on the ball than we suspect.

368
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,110
她对各国今后的友好关系怎么看呢？
How did she feel about the future friendship of nations?

369
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,950
要看年轻人
Youth.

370
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,030
她认为年轻人
She felt that the youth of the world

371
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,450
必将引导世界走向更美好的未来
must lead the way to a better world.

372
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,920
蛮新颖的
Original.

373
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,670
顺便问下 她当时穿的什么？
By the way, what was she wearing?

374
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,710
你是说 她当时着的什么装吗？
You mean, what did she have on?

375
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,130
还能是什么意思
That's usually what it means.

376
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
怎么了？这里对你来说有点儿太热了吗？
What's the matter? Is it a little warm in here for you?

377
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,970
不 没有 我刚跑回来的 就这样
No, no. I just hurried over here, that's all.

378
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,760
当然了 拿着这样不得了的料<font color=#FF7F00>[自然要跑快点儿]</font>
Naturally, with a story of these dimensions.

379
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,180
你刚说她穿的是灰色的？
Did you say she was wearing gray?

380
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,520
不 我没那么说过
No, I didn't say that.

381
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,060
嗯 她通常都穿灰色的
Well, she usually wears gray.

382
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,400
噢 是灰色的
Well, it was a kind of a gray.

383
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,530
我想我知道你说的是哪件连衣裙 衣领是金色的那件
I think I know the dress you mean. It has a gold collar.

384
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,070
就是那件 就是那件 没错
That's the one. That's the one, yeah.

385
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,320
我不知道该怎么去描述它 不过...
I didn't know exactly how to describe it, but that's...

386
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,910
我想你已经把它描述得很清楚了
I think you described it very well,

387
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,240
事实上公主殿下
in view of the fact that Her Highness

388
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,910
今天凌晨3:00突染疾病
was taken violently ill at 3:00 this morning,

389
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,870
正躺在床上发着高烧
put to bed with a high fever,

390
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,710
她今天所有的预订活动全部都取消了！
and has had all her appointments for today canceled in toto!

391
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
全部？
In toto?

392
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,800
是的 布兰德利先生 全部
Yes, Mr. Bradley, in toto.

393
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,430
这还真有点儿难咽<font color=#FF7F00>[之前从门外秘书顺的饼干]</font>
It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

394
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,100
- 鉴于你刚从她那儿回来
- 没错
- In view of the fact that you just left her,
- of course.

395
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,760
你看看这些 布兰德利先生
But here it is, Mr. Bradley,

396
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,310
罗马所有的报纸头版都登了
all over the front page of every newspaper in Rome.

397
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,390
好吧 好吧 我睡过头了 谁都会睡过头的
All right, all right, I overslept. It can happen to anybody.

398
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,980
要是你起得够早 有时间读下今天早上的报纸
If you only got up early enough to read a morning paper,

399
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,020
你也许不会看到什么新闻事件
you might discover little news events,

400
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,190
或是娱乐大众的八卦
little items of general interest

401
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,360
但至少不会让人看过之后被
that might prevent someone in the future from getting immersed

402
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,320
这样一个镀着金的 精心包装 闪闪发光的谎话骗得晕头转向
in such a gold-plated, triple-decked, star-spangled lie

403
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,120
比如你刚才跟我说的那个
as you have just told me.

404
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,490
如果我是你 我就会试着干点儿别的工作
If I were you, I would try some other line of business,

405
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
比如床垫测试
like mattress testing.

406
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,080
这就是公主？
Is this the princess?

407
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,500
是的 布兰德利先生 这就是公主
Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

408
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,590
不是安妮 奥克莱 桃勒西 拉莫 也不是蒋介石夫人
<font color=#FF7F00>[安妮 奥克莱 1860-1926 美国著名神枪手 首位美国女明星]</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>[桃勒西 拉莫 1914-1996 美国演员及歌手]</font>

<font color=#FF7F00>[Dorothy Lamour 1914-1996 American actress and singer]</font>

409
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,670
好好看清楚她的样子
Take a good look at her.

410
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,260
说不定哪天你还得采访她
You might be interviewing her again someday.

411
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,670
我被炒了吗？
Am I fired?

412
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,550
没有 你没有被炒
No, you're not fired.

413
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,350
我要炒你的时候 你都不用问
When I want to fire you, you won't have to ask.

414
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,000
你就知道自己被炒掉了！
<font color=#FF7F00>[即登报 甚至可能在讣告栏：布兰德利 你被炒了！]</font>
You'll know you're fired!

415
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,520
那家伙疯了
The man's mad.

416
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,380
乔万尼 我是乔 布兰德利
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

417
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,880
现在 仔细听好了 我要你马上去我的房间
Now, listen carefully. I want you to hurry up to my place

418
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,970
去看看是不是还有人睡在那儿
and see if there's somebody there asleep.

419
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,430
好吧 乔先生 我这就去看
Say, Mr. Joe, I look.

420
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
你等着
You wait.

421
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
乔先生？
Mr. Joe?

422
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,240
我在！喂 喂 喂 跟我说 跟我说
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me. Tell me.

423
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,170
乔万尼 我爱你 好了 听着
Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

424
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,710
什么事 乔先生？
Yes, Mr. Joe?

425
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,250
拿把枪？
A gun?

426
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
不！
No!

427
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,800
好吧 拿把枪 拿把刀 拿什么都行
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything,

428
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,550
但别让任何人进出
but nobody goes in and nobody goes out.

429
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,930
好的
Okay.

430
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,690
你还没走？
You still here?

431
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,240
要是对这个女人真的做个采访值多少钱？
How much would a real interview with this dame be worth?

432
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,910
你是指公主殿下吗？
Are you referring to Her Highness?

433
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,410
我说的不是安妮 奥克莱 桃勒西 拉莫 或者...
I'm not referring to Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour or...

434
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,450
多少钱？
How much?

435
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
你问这干什么？你能采访到的机会...
What do you care? You got about as much chance as...

436
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,080
我知道 可要是我办到了 值多少钱？
I know, but if I did, how much would it be worth?

437
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
光简单的跟她谈下世界局势就值250
Just a plain talk on world conditions might be worth 250.

438
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,300
她对服装的品味 当然 就更值钱了 应该值1,000吧
Her views on clothes, of course, would be worth a lot more, maybe 1,000.

439
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
- 美元？
- 美元
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

440
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,390
我说的是她对所有事的看法
I'm talking about her views on everything.

441
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,060
公主私密的渴望
The private and secret longings of a princess.

442
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,560
她内心深处的想法
Her innermost thoughts,

443
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:24,730
将透露给你的罗马通讯记者 这是私人的 面对面的 独家采访
as revealed to your Rome correspondent in a private, personal, exclusive interview.

444
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,860
这点子不行吗 嗯？
Can't use it, huh?

445
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,620
我就知道你不会喜欢的
I didn't think you'd like it.

446
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,000
过来
Come here.

447
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,920
还有 爱情观了 我想？
Love angle, too, I suppose?

448
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,630
详细到所有的爱情观
Practically all love angle.

449
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,670
要附照片
With pictures.

450
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,340
可以的话 多少钱？
Could be. How much?

451
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,590
这么详细的料对任何通讯社来说都值5,000
That particular story will be worth five grand to any news service.

452
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,680
不过告诉我 布兰德利先生 要是你清醒的话
But tell me, Mr. Bradley, if you are sober,

453
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,890
你要怎样去完成这个不可思议的采访？
just how you are going to obtain this fantastic interview.

454
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,480
我打算装扮成一支体温计进入她的病房
I plan to enter her sickroom disguised as a thermometer.

455
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,940
你说的是5,000？我要和你握手约定
You said five grand? I want you to shake on that.

456
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,780
你知道吗 当然 今天公主殿下是躺在床上
And you realize, of course, Her Highness is in bed today

457
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,820
但明天就要离开去雅典了？
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

458
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
知道
Yep.

459
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,950
既然这样 我还想再跟你打个赌
Now, I'd like to make a little side bet with you.

460
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,870
500 赌你弄不回来那份料
500 says you don't come up with the story.

461
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,330
你看那个做什么？
What are you looking at that for?

462
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
我只是想看看现在什么时候了
I just want to see what time it is.

463
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,290
- 嗯？
- 看下今天几号了
- Huh?
- What day it is.

464
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,670
就这么说定了！
It's a deal!

465
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,800
我们握手吧
Now I'd like you to shake.

466
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,600
在我看来 你这500已经是我的了
Let's see, you're into me for about 500 now.

467
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,810
要是你输了 你就欠我1,000
When you lose this bet, you'll owe me 1,000.

468
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,520
为什么 你这卑鄙的骗子 我当然会赢你
Why, you poor sucker, I'll practically own you.

469
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,100
到现在你已经套了我好多年了
You have practically owned me for a couple of years now.

470
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,480
不过现在都结束了
But that's all over.

471
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,810
我会赢了那笔钱
I'm going to win that money,

472
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,650
然后 我会用它给自己买张回纽约的单程机票
and with it, I'm gonna buy me a one-way ticket back to New York.

473
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,240
接着说 接着说 我就爱听你发牢骚
Go on, go on, I love to hear you whine.

474
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,450
等我到了一家真正的新闻编辑部的时候 我会很高兴想到
And when I'm back in a real newsroom, I'll enjoy thinking about you,

475
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,530
你坐在这儿 手里皮带那头的项圈里什么也没有
sitting here with an empty leash in your hands

476
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,080
再没人会在你面前瑟瑟发抖
and nobody to twitch for you.

477
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,290
再见了 鸽子！<font color=#FF7F00>[鸽子 咕咕咕 话多且无意义]</font>
So long, pigeon!

478
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[知道意大利为什么出黑手党了吧？]</font>

479
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,270
嘿 乔 你知道什么吗？
Hey, Joe. What you know?

480
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,440
一切都还好吗 乔万尼？
Is everything okay, Giovanni?

481
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,900
没人来找她 她也没出去
Nobody she's come. Nobody she's go.

482
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,990
绝对没人进出过
Absolutely nobody.

483
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,870
干得漂亮 太谢谢了
Swell. Thanks a lot.

484
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,000
乔万尼...
Giovanni...

485
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,120
你想赚点儿钱吗？
How would you like to make some money?

486
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,210
- 钱？
- 是的
- Money?
- Yeah.

487
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,460
这就对了 好了 听着 我有个方法绝对能赚钱
That's the stuff. Now, look, I've got a sure thing.

488
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,340
两天之内让你的钱翻一倍
Double your money back in two days.

489
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,590
让我的钱翻一倍？
Double my money?

490
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,390
是的 嗯 我需要点儿启动资金
Yeah, well, I need a little investment capital to swing the deal.

491
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,390
好了 要是你能借我一点儿钱...
Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash...

492
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,520
你还欠我两个月的房租呢
You owing me two months' rent,

493
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,110
你还想我借钱给你？
and you want me to lend you money?

494
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,650
- 是的
- 不行
- Yeah.
- No.

495
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,990
明天你会后悔的
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

496
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[这个动作让译者想起一个词：斯德哥尔摩综合症]</font>

497
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,590
公主殿下？
Your Highness?

498
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,100
公主殿下？
Your Royal Highness?

499
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,100
嗯 怎么了？
Yes, what is it?

500
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,150
亲爱的博纳科温医生...
Dear Dr. Bonnachoven...

501
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:40,290
是我 是的 噢 你没事了 好多了 你想要点儿什么吗？
Sure, yes, well, you're fine. Much better. Is there anything you want?

502
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,830
好多东西
So many things.

503
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,580
- 是吗？那好 跟医生说吧
- 好...
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.
- So...

504
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,000
把一切都告诉医生吧
Tell the good doctor everything.

505
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,670
我梦见 我梦见
I dreamt, and I dreamt.

506
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,420
什么？好了 你梦见什么了？
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

507
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,810
我梦见自己睡在街道上 然后来了一个年轻的男人
I dreamt I was asleep in the street, and a young man came.

508
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,270
他长得高大又强壮 而且他对我很有意
He was tall and strong, and he was so mean to me.

509
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,570
是吗？
He was?

510
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,740
那感觉太好了
It was wonderful.

511
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,690
早上好
Good morning.

512
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[注意嘴角那微微一颤 NICE!]</font>

513
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,190
博纳科温医生呢？
Where's Dr. Bonnachoven?

514
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,570
我恐怕自己认识的人里没叫那个名字的
I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.

515
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,570
刚才同我说话的不是他吗？
Wasn't I talking to him just now?

516
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,030
我恐怕不是
Afraid not.

517
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,080
我是出了什么事故吗？
Have I had an accident?

518
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,040
不是
No.

519
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,250
我可以坐起来吗？<font color=#FF7F00>[原文意思认为自己出了意外身体不能动]</font>
Quite safe for me to sit up?

520
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,130
完全可以
Perfect.

521
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,310
谢谢
Thank you.

522
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,780
这些是你的吗？<font color=#FF7F00>[这一段的表演相当精彩]</font>
Are these yours?

523
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,950
你丢了什么吗？
Did you lose something?

524
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:57,870
没有
No.

525
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,710
你能告诉我 我这是在什么地方吗？
Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am?

526
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,920
噢 让您见笑了 这是我的公寓
Well, this is what is laughingly known as my apartment.

527
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,550
你是强行把我带到这儿来的吗？
Did you bring me here by force?

528
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,260
不 不 不 恰恰相反
No, no, no. Quite the contrary.

529
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,350
我整晚都在这里 一个人？
Have I been here all night, alone?

530
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,940
要是不算上我的话 是的
If you don't count me, yes.

531
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,520
这么说我整晚都同你在这里？
So I've spent the night here with you?

532
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,320
噢 好了 我的确不知道自己该怎么说
Well, now, I don't know that I'd use those words, exactly,

533
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,370
不过从某种角度上来说 是的
but from a certain angle, yes.

534
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
<font color=#FF7F00>[这一段的面部表情 SO NICE!]</font>

535
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[亲爱的 那颗犬齿算是龅牙吗？请脑残粉务必恕译者无罪]</font>

536
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,970
你好
How do you do?

537
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,340
你好
How do you do?

538
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,010
- 你是...
- 布兰德利 乔 布兰德利
- And you are...
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

539
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,100
很高兴认识你
Delighted.

540
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,810
你不会知道能认识您我有多么高兴
You don't know how delighted I am to meet you.

541
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,600
你可以坐下了
You may sit down.

542
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,480
非常感谢<font color=#FF7F00>[流氓 你就没看人家手指的哪边吗？]</font>
Thank you very much.

543
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,610
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

544
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,990
你就叫我安雅吧
You may call me Anya.

545
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,660
谢谢 安雅
Thank you, Anya.

546
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,830
你要来杯咖啡吗？
Would you like a cup of coffee?

547
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,500
- 现在什么时候了？
- 快1:30了
- What time is it?
- About 1:30.

548
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,340
1:30！我必须换上衣服离开了！
1:30! I must get dressed and go!

549
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,340
为什么？你这么急为什么？时间还多着呢
Why? What's your hurry? There's lots of time.

550
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,180
不 没时间了 我给你带来的麻烦已经够多了
No, there isn't, and I've been quite enough trouble to you as it is.

551
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,510
麻烦？
Trouble?

552
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,220
我不觉得你有什么麻烦到我
You're not what I'd call trouble.

553
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,350
我没有吗？
I'm not?

554
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,940
我去给你准备沐浴
I'll run a bath for you.

555
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,580
你可以进去了
There you are.

556
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,580
现在我们开始
Here we go now.

557
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,210
就这样别动 姿势很好
There you are. That does it.

558
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,590
别拉那么紧 好吗？
Give me a little slack, will you?

559
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,920
艾文！你为什么不接电话？
Irving! Why don't you answer the phone?

560
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,470
听着 我是乔
Look, this is Joe.

561
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,590
艾文 你能在5分钟内赶过来吗？
Irving, can you get over here in about five minutes?

562
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,260
不行 我现在过不来 乔 我正忙着呢
No, I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy.

563
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,100
不行
No.

564
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,810
乔 我没工夫听电话
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

565
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,810
去换上你的下一套服装 好吗 亲爱的？独木舟
Go and get into your next outfit, will you, honey? The canoe.

566
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,310
是什么样的独家新闻 乔？
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

567
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,520
听着 艾文 在电话里我可不能说
Look, Irving, I can't talk over the telephone.

568
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,690
要是说漏了一个词
One word in the wrong quarter,

569
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,150
这事就会捅上天去
and this whole thing might blow sky-high.

570
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,030
这是上头版的料 我只能告诉你这么多了
It's front-page stuff. That's all I can tell you.

571
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,280
可能是政治性的 或者可能是件轰动的丑闻
It might be political or it might be a sensational scandal.

572
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,820
我还不确定 总之是猛料
I'm not sure which, but it's a big story.

573
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,910
需要附上些照片
It's got to have pictures.

574
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,790
可我现在不能过来 乔 我很忙...
But I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy...

575
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,290
我很忙现在 半小时后我还要去Rocca咖啡馆同弗朗西斯卡见面
I'm busy now, and I'm meeting Francesca at Rocca's in a half an hour.

576
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,430
听不懂
Don't understand.

577
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
你在这里
There you are.

578
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,540
我在看附近的那些人们
I was looking at all the people out here.

579
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,500
住在这样的地方一定很有意思
It must be fun to live in a place like this.

580
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,250
是的 有时候是很有意思
Yeah, it has its moments.

581
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,670
我可以向你介绍每间公寓的主人
I can give you a running commentary on each apartment.

582
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,090
我必须走了
I must go.

583
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,420
我只是在等着和你说声再见
I only waited to say good-bye.

584
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,720
再见？为什么 我们才刚认识
Good-bye? Why, we've only just met.

585
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,560
- 要吃点儿早餐吗？
- 抱歉 我没时间了
- How about some breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

586
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,480
什么都不吃就急着走 那一定是非常重要的约会
It must be a pretty important date to run off without eating.

587
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,190
是的
It is.

588
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,860
好吧 我陪你去 不管你去哪儿
Well, I'll go along with you, wherever you are going.

589

That's all right, thank you. I can find the place.

590

谢谢你让我睡在你的床上
Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.

591
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,370
没关系的 这不算什么
That's all right. Think nothing of it.

592
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,330
你真是太体贴了
It was very considerate of you.

593
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,410
你在躺椅上一定非常不舒服
You must have been awfully uncomfortable on that couch.

594
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,580
不 我一直都睡躺椅上！
No. Do it all the time!

595
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,050
- 再见 布兰德利先生
- 再见
- Good-bye, Mr. Bradley.
- Good-bye.

596
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,680
从那里穿过去 然后沿阶梯下到尽头
Go right through there and down all the steps.

597
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,100
谢谢
Thank you.

598
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,130
噢 世界真小
Well, small world.

00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,710
是的 我差点儿忘了 你能借我些钱吗？
Yes. I almost forgot. Can you lend me some money?

600
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,010
好的 可以 你昨晚身上就没带钱 对吧？
Yeah, that's right. You didn't have any last night, did you?

601
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,480
你要多少钱？
How much was it that you wanted?

602
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,980
噢 我不知道自己要多少 你身上有多少？
Well, I don't know how much I need. How much have you got?

嗯 我想我们就五五分吧 这是1,000里拉
Well, suppose we just split this 50-50? Here's 1,000 lira.

604
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,530
1,000？你真的要给我这么多吗？
1,000? Can you really spare all that?

605
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,820
这大概相当于$1.50美元
It's about $1.50.

606

噢 我会让人把它送还给你的

怎么了？
What was the matter?

688
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,980
和老师闹矛盾了？
Trouble with the teacher?

689
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,190
不 不是因为那种事
No, nothing like that.

690
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,810
噢 你不会无缘无故就从学校偷跑出来吧
Well, you don't just run away from school for nothing.

691
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,360
我本想就偷跑出来一两个小时
I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

692
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,740
他们昨晚给我用了一些让我睡觉的药
They gave me something last night to make me sleep.

693
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,700
我明白了
I see.

694
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,530
我现在最好还是乘出租车回去了
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

695
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,620
噢 听我说 在你这么做之前
Well, look, before you do,

696
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,710
为什么不再玩一会儿呢？
why don't you take a little time for yourself?

697
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,210
那就再玩一个小时吧

698
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,880
生活充满了未知数 玩个一整天吧
Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

699

你想都想不到的
You can't imagine.

我想一整天都做自己喜欢的事情
I'd like to do just whatever I like the whole day long.

703
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,890
你是说 像是剪短头发 吃冰淇淋这样的事情？
You mean, things like having your hair cut, eating gelato?

Yes, and I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe and look in shop windows,

705
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,360
在雨中漫步
walk in the rain.

706
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,940
做一些好玩 甚至有些刺激的事
Have fun, and maybe some excitement.

707
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,280
- 这些对你来说不算什么 对吧？
- 很不错
- Doesn't seem much to you, does it?
- It's great.

708
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,530
这么跟你说吧
Tell you what.

709
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,780
我们为什么不一起做这些事情呢？
Why don't we do all those things together?

710
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,370
你不用工作吗？
Don't you have to work?

711
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,830
工作？不用 今天放假
Work? No. Today's going to be a holiday.

712
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,000
可你不会想要做一大堆愚蠢的事情的
But you don't want to do a lot of silly things.

713
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,170
我会不想吗？
Don't I?

714
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,420
第一件想做的事 去家路边咖啡馆 这就走吧

I know just the place. Rocca's.

716
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,930
要是学校里的人看到你新剪的头发他们会怎么说？
What will the people at school say when they see your new haircut?

717
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,770
他们会大吃一惊的
They'll have a fit.

718
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,650
要是他们知道我整晚都在你的房间里他们会说什么呢？
What would they say if they knew I'd spent the night in your room?

719
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:42,900
噢 我告诉你吧 你不能告诉你的朋友 我也不会告诉我的朋友
Well, I tell you what. You don't tell your folks, and I won't tell mine.

720
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,440
就这么说定了
It's a pact.

721
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,490

725
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,420
你在那所学校里一定过着奢华的生活

午饭喝香槟
Champagne for lunch.

727
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,340

Forty years on the job. What do you know about that?

733
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,150
他是干什么的？
What does he do?

734
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,530
嗯 最接近的说法应该叫公共关系吧
Well, mostly you might call it public relations.

735
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,030
噢 那工作挺辛苦的

739
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,460
噢 干那行的人几乎就不能辞职
Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit,

740
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,460
除非他们的健康状况真的恶化到无法继续工作
unless it's actually unhealthy for them to continue.

741
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,960

776
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,910
听着 我还是懂得起的 再见了
Look, I can take a hint. I'll see you around.

777
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,240
你的饮料才刚来
Your drink's just here.

778
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,830
噢 你的饮料正好来了 艾文 别急着走
Yeah, here's your drink right now, Irving. Take it easy.

779
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,330
我对刚才的事很抱歉 坐下吧 他人很不错的
I'm sorry about that. Sit down. That's a good fellow.

780
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,170
喝杯...这才是好孩子
Have a... That's a boy.

781
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,510

You're...

782
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,010
你在拧我的手臂 你知道的
You're twisting my arm, you know.

783
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,890
当心点儿别再弄洒就好了
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

784
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,300
弄洒？刚才是谁弄洒的？
Spill? Who's been doing the spilling?

785
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,470
你
You.

786
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,060
- 我？
- 是的
- Me?
- Yeah.

787
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,140
你在哪儿找到的这个疯子？
Where did you find this loony?

788
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,270
没有说你 敬你一杯
You're okay. Here's to you.

789
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,820
致以我最美好的祝愿
Here's hoping for the best.

790
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,280
要不是因为这发型 我发誓...
If it wasn't for that hair, I'd swear that...

791
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,910
谢谢
Thanks.

792
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,500
你滑倒了 艾文 你滑倒了 你刚才差点儿伤着自己
You slipped, Irving. You slipped, you almost hurt yourself that time.

793
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:46,880
我滑倒了？我差点儿伤着自己？
I slipped? I almost hurt myself?

794
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,040
- 乔 我不是滑倒的！
- 你一定扭伤得不轻
- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain there.

795
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,500
别管我扭伤得怎样 乔
Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe.

796
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,420
我们最好到那边去把衣服弄干净
We'd better go in here and get it fixed up.

797
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,840
- 正好 我也想...
- 我们能失陪一会儿吗？
- Yeah, I'd like to...
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

798
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,130
好的 当然可以 我非常抱歉
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

799
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,680
- 过来 朋友
- 乔 你先别忙
- Come here, pal.
- Joe, now wait a minute.

800
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,760
你这是想干什么？把你的手从我身上拿开
What are you trying to do now? Take your hands off me.

801
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,520
- 你有带打火机吗？
- 要那个东西干什么？
- Have you got your lighter?
- What's that got to do with it?

802
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,980
- 你有带吗？
- 是的 可你要拿去干什么？
- Have you got it?
- Yeah, but what are you trying to do?

803
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,980
听着 给你5,000你愿意吗？
Listen, what would you do for five grand?

804
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,480
- 5,000？
- 好的 听着
- Five grand?
- Okay, look.

805
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,900
她不知道我是谁也不知道我是干什么的
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

806
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,950
听着 艾文 这就是我说的料 是我发掘的 我得保住它
Look, Irving, this is my story. I dug it up. I've got to protect it.

807
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,740
她真的就是...
She's really the...

808
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:23,410
你的相片会让这个短暂的史诗般的作品升值一倍
Your tintypes are gonna make this little epic twice as valuable.

809
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,540
- “公主前往贫民区访问”
- 赚的钱你拿25%
- "The princess goes slumming."
- You're in for 25% of the take.

810
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,290
- 这能赚5,000
- 最少这个数 亨尼西已经保证出这个价
- The take's five Gs.
- Minimum. Hennessy shook hands on it.

811
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,790
- 那就是$1,500美元
- 是$1,250美元<font color=#FF7F00>[脑子钝就是坑爹啊]</font>
- That's $1,500.
- It's $1,250.

812
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,170

Okay, now lend me 30,000.

814
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,720
30,000？那可是50美元 你这是要买王冠吗？
30,000? That's 50 bucks. Are you gonna buy the crown jewels?

815
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
她正在那儿喝香槟 我没钱结账了
She's out there now drinking champagne that I can't pay for.

816
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,300
我们得逗她开心 对吧？
We've got to entertain her, don't we?

817
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,760
乔 我们不能带着这么惹眼的公主在城里到处转悠
Joe, we can't go running around town with a hot princess.

818
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,600
你到底想不想做这笔交易了？
Do you want in on this deal or don't you?

819
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,900
周六把钱还我
This I want back Saturday.

820
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,320
好的 你的打火机呢？
Okay. Now where's your lighter?

821
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,950
我们开始干吧
Let's go to work.

822
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,040
好点儿了吗？
Better now?

823
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,790
- 你的耳朵
- 我的耳朵？
- Your ear.
- My ear?

824
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,670
是的 乔给我弄好了
Yeah. Joe fixed it.

825
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,090
你介意抽支烟吗？
Would you care for a cigarette?

826
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,590
好的 请给我吧
Yes, please.

827
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,840
你也许不相信 但我这真是第一次
You won't believe this, but it's my very first.

828
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,550
你第一次？
Your very first?

829
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,640
学校不准吸烟吗？
No smoking in school?

830
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,310
你的第一支香烟
Your first cigarette.

831
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,730
好了 这小东西弄好了
There. The gizmo works.

832
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,030
噢 感觉怎么样？还好吗？
Well, what's the verdict? Okay?

833
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,700
没什么感觉
Nothing to it.

834
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,950
这就对了 没什么感觉
That's right. Nothing to it.

835
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,740
我要伸一下腿
I'll stretch my legs a little here.

836
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,660
这次我请客 艾文
I'll pick this one up, Irving.

837
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,710
是啊 你付得起
Yeah. You can afford it.

838
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,290
好了 接下来我们干什么呢？我们要稍微做个时间表吗？
Well, what shall we do next? Shall we make out a little schedule?

839
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,340
别说那个词 拜托
Not that word, please.

840
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,470
我说的不是工作...学校时间表
I didn't mean a work... School schedule.

841
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,220
我说的是娱乐时间表
I meant a fun schedule.

842
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,640
好的 我们走吧
Yes. Let's just go.

843
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,930
噢 你怎么样 艾文？你准备好了吗？
Well, how about you, Irving? Are you ready?

844
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,310
- 是的
- 那走吧
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

845
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:27,560
弗朗西斯卡！
Francesca!

846
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,980
- 这位是...
- 史密蒂
- This is...
- Smitty.

847
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,490
她可是位千金小姐 艾文 千金
She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

848
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,320
5,000 艾文
Five grand, Irving.

849
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,530
- 乔！
- 你这是要去哪儿？
- Joe!
- Where are you going now?

850
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,490
亲爱的 我要开始工作了 我晚上再给你电话
Honey, I gotta work. I'll call you tonight.

851
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,830
看看那些家伙！
Look at those men!

852
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,450
他们应该别那么引人注意的
They were supposed to be inconspicuous.

853
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,660
是你要求穿便装的
You asked for plain clothes.

854
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,450
嘿！抱歉
Hey! Excuse me.

855
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,930
嘿！停下！骑着VESPA回来！
Hey! Stop! Come back with your VESPA here!

856
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,700
- 让我来...
- 不 不 让我来 我可以开的
- Let me take this...
- No, no. Let it go. I can do it.

857
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,700
<font color=#FF7F00>[译者忽然觉得李刚他儿子有点儿冤 要是他爹就给他买个VESPA的话...]</font>

噢
Yeah.

860
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,620
从现在起我要改过自新了
I'm going straight from now on.

861
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,090
美国通讯社？他什么意思？
American News Service? What did he mean?

862
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,010
噢 知道吗 要是你说自己是新闻界的
Well, you know, you say you're with the press,

863
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,760
任何麻烦你都能躲过去的
you can get away with anything.

864
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,640
骑着<font color=#FF7F00>[VESPA]</font>摩托车去教堂结婚吧 了不起的家伙
Going to church to get married on a scooter, that's a hot one.

865
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,640
乔相当会说谎
Joe's a wonderful liar.

866
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,520
恭喜 恭喜
Congratulations. Congratulations.

867
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,290
你不用这么担心 我不会要你娶我的
You don't have to look so worried. I won't hold you to it.

868
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,160
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

869
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,750
你也没必要这么高兴吧！
You don't have to be too grateful!

870
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,330
好的 我没有
Okay, I won't.

871
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,550
我也很能说谎 对吧 布兰德利先生？
I'm a good liar, too, aren't I, Mr. Bradley?

872
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,420
是我认识的人里最棒的
The best I ever met.

873
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,180
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

874
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,840
我说...
Say...

875
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,140
跟我来吧
Come with me.

876
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,980
诚实之口

877
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:33,190
传说中要是你把手放在这里并说谎的话
The legend is that if you're given to lying and put your hand in there,

878
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,940
手就会被咬掉
<font color=#FF7F00>[这个传说自其17世纪出土后出现]</font>
it'll be bitten off.

879
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,780
这真可怕
What a horrid idea.

880
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,490
你试试看
Let's see you do it.

881
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,680
你试试看
Let's see you do it.

882
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,140
好吧
Sure.

883
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,700
你好
Hello.

884
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,790
你这个坏蛋！
You beast!

885
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,660
你根本就没事！你的手根本就没有受伤！
It was perfectly all right! You never hurt your hand!

886
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,170
抱歉 开个玩笑而已
I'm sorry. It's just a joke.

887
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,880
你的手根本就没有受伤
You never hurt your hand.

888
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,920
抱歉 你没事吧？
I'm sorry. You okay?

889
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,760
- 是的
- 那好 我们走吧
- Yes.
- All right. Let's go.

890
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,130
小心！
Look out!

891
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,130
<font color=#FF7F00>[译者趋同于这是古罗马的下水道井盖的说法]
[各位观众是不是觉得有些冷？]</font>

892
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,350
我去把车停在那个墙角
I'll park at the corner.

893
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,620
这些题字 是要表达什么意思？
What do they mean, all these inscriptions?

894
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,630
噢 每一个都代表着实现了一个愿望
Well, each one represents a wish fulfilled.

895
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:28,250
这始于大战期间一次空袭的时候
It all started during the war when there was an air raid right out here,

896
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,840
一个男人同自己的四个孩子被困在街上
a man with his four children was caught in the street.

897
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,590
他们跑到这堵墙边寻求庇护
They ran over against the wall right there for shelter

898
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,220
祈祷自己能够平安
and prayed for safety.

899
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,350
炸弹就掉在非常近的地方 可没有一个人受伤
Bombs fell very close, but no one was hurt.

900
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:43,520
后来 这个男人回到这里 挂上了第一个纪念牌
Later on, the man came back and he put up the first of these tablets.

901
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
从那时起 这里就成为了一个圣地
Since then, it's become a sort of a shrine.

902
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:48,440
人们到这里来 等到他们的愿望实现的时候
People come, and whenever their wishes are granted,

903
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,650
他们就会再挂上这样一个小瓷片
they put up another one of these little plaques.

904
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,070
很美的故事
Lovely story.

905
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,780
看看这些题字吧
Read some of the inscriptions.

906
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,920
要许愿吗？
Make a wish?

907
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,880
还是跟医生说吗？
Tell the doctor?

908
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,220
不管怎样 愿望能实现的机会都微乎其微
Anyway, the chances of it being granted are very slight.

909
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,310
噢 现在去哪儿呢？
Well, what now?

910
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,190
我知道一个好地方 可以在船上跳舞
I've heard of a wonderful place for dancing on a boat.

911
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,270
你指的是 圣安杰洛<font color=#FF7F00>[城堡]</font>边的驳船？
<font color=#FF7F00>[<i>哈德良陵墓</i> 现名<i>圣安杰洛城堡</i> 位于帕克 阿德里亚诺，罗马]

912
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,860
是的 我们今晚去不好吗？
Yes, couldn't we go there tonight?

913
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,110
- 为什么不呢？
- 只要是你想做的都行
- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

914
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,660
等到了午夜 我就会穿着我的水晶鞋乘上一辆南瓜车 离开的
And then at midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper.

915
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,490
那是童话故事的结局
And that'll be the end of the fairytale.

916
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,080
噢 我猜艾文现在得走了
Well, I guess Irving has to go now.

917
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,660
我吗？
I do?

918
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,830
是的 要知道 你还有单大业务要谈
Yes, you know, that big business development of yours

919
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,000
你不是得参加吗？
that you have to attend to?

920
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,380
噢 业务
Oh, the development.

921
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,170
没错 那可不能怠慢了
Yes, can't afford not to take care of that.

922
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,840
好吧 晚些时候再见 史密蒂
Yeah. I'll see you later, Smitty.

923
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,220
- 祝大业务谈判顺利
- 谢谢
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

924
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,070
两位 谢谢
Two, please.

925
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,500
<font color=#FF7F00>[要是十三陵也这么闹的话...]</font>

927
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,230
你好
Hello.

928
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,650
你好
Hello.

929
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,870
布兰德利先生 要是你不介意我这么说的话
Mr. Bradley, if you don't mind my saying so,

930
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,000
我觉得你是个
ringer<font color=#FF7F00>[按照布兰德利之前的胡诌 此处为有魅力的人]</font>
I think you are a ringer.

931
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,500
什么？
A what?

932
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,790
噢！
Oh!

933
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,540
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

934
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,920
你整天都陪着我做我想做的事
You've spent the whole day doing things I've always wanted to.

935
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,090
为什么？
<font color=#FF7F00>[公主一直都觉得你对她动了情]</font>
Why?

936
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,380
我不知道 这是应该的
I don't know. It seemed the thing to do.

937
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,890
我从不知道有这么好的人
I've never heard of anybody so kind.

938
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,850
举手之劳
It wasn't any trouble.

939
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,390
如此的慷慨无私
Or so completely unselfish.

940
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,320
我们去吧台喝一杯吧
Let's have a drink at the bar.

941
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,910
你来了！
There you are!

942
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,700
我找你很久了 我还以为也许你不会来了
I look for you a long time. I think maybe you not come.

943
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,830
剪掉...都剪掉！
Off... All off!

944
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,040
短发很好看 对吧？
It's nice without, isn't it?

945
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,250
酷
Cool.

946
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,750
非常 非常好
<font color=#FF7F00>[意大利人恶补英语就补出来个GOOD!]</font>
Very, very good.

947
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,590
这位是布兰德利先生
This is Mr. Bradley.

948
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,550
我 马里奥 德兰尼
I, Mario Delani.

949
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,130
认识很久了吗？
Old friends?

950
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:06,130

Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon. He invited me here tonight.

951
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,680
噢 你说你的名字是？
Well, what did you say the name was?

952
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,140
德兰尼 马里奥 德兰尼
Delani. Mario Delani.

953
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:14,270
马里奥 德兰尼 非常高兴认识你
Mario Delani. I'm very glad to know you.

954
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,940
我也是
Me, too.

955
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,400
我可以...可以...你介意吗？
May I enjoy myself... The pleasure... Do you mind?

956
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,990
不 不介意 请便吧
No, no. Go right ahead.

957
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,400
谢谢
Thank you.

958
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,050
- 我有错过什么吗？
- 你来得正是时候 朋友
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

959
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,220
和史密蒂跳舞的那人是谁？
Who's Smitty dancing with?

960
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,060
理发师

961
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,020
今天下午给她理发 今晚还约了她

962
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,230
公主和理发师
The princess and the barber.

963
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,880
怎么回事？
What is it?

964
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,650
奥伽斯
August.

965
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,370

Thank you!

966
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,000

967
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,430
公主殿下
Your Highness.

968
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,440
慢慢跳到入口那边去
You'll dance quietly towards the entrance.

969
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,230
那里有辆车在等着
There is a car waiting.

970
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,310
- 不
- 公主殿下 请吧
- No.
- Your Highness, please.

971
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,860
你弄错了
You've made a mistake.

972
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,610
放开我 你不肯放手吗？
Let me go. Will you let me go?

973
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,030
布兰德利先生！放开我 你不放手吗？布兰德利先生！
Mr. Bradley! Let me go, will you? Mr. Bradley!

974

放手！
Let go!

975
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,600
你...
You...

976
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,060
再给他一下 史密蒂！
Hit him again, Smitty!

977
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,320
- 乔 这是我的车钥匙
- 警察来了 警察来了 快走
- Joe, here are my car keys.
- The police. The police. Come on.

978
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,620
快到桥那边去
The other side of the bridge.

979
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,620
<font color=#FF7F00>[无处不在的喵星人 哪怕只有个背影]</font>

980
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,060
没事吧？
All right?

981
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,220
还好 你呢？
Fine. How are you?

982
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:18,430
没事
Fine.

983
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,650
你知道吗 你刚才真的好厉害
Say, you know, you were great back there.

984
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,860
你也不差啊
You weren't so bad yourself.

985
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,720
我想我们最好还是乘艾文的车离开这里吧
I guess we'd better get Irving's car and get out of here.

986
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,120
这是自罗马广播的美国时段节目
This is The American Hour from Rome,

987
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,120
现在继续我们的音乐精选节目
continuing our program of musical selections.

988
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,690
衣服都弄脏了吗？
Everything ruined?

989
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,110
没有 很快就能干了
No. They'll be dry in a minute.

990
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,490
很合身
Suits you.

991
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,990
你可以一直穿我的衣服
You should always wear my clothes.

992
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,200
看起来是这样的
It seems I do.

993
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,750
我想喝点儿酒应该会感觉好些的
I thought a little wine might be good.

994
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,290
我可以做些东西吃吗？
Shall I cook something?

995
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,380
没有厨房 也没有可以做的东西 我都在外面吃
No kitchen. Nothing to cook. I always eat out.

996
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,050
你喜欢这样吗？
Do you like that?

997
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,550
生活并不总是如人意的
Life isn't always what one likes.

998
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,890
是吗？
Is it?

999
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,350
是的 不是的
No, it isn't.

1000
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,110
- 累了吗？
- 有一点儿
- Tired?
- A little.

1001
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:43,570
你过了相当难忘的一天
You've had quite a day.

1002
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:45,110
美妙的一天
A wonderful day.

1003
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,820
这是自罗马广播的美国时段节目
This is The American Hour from Rome,

1004
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:50,410
现在用英语及意大利语播送一条特别新闻简讯
broadcasting a special news bulletin in English and Italian.

1005
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:53,990
截至今晚 仍旧没有卧病在床的安公主的进一步消息
Tonight, there is no further word from the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome,

1006
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:58,500
她在欧洲贸易推动之旅的最后一站 罗马 昨日突染疾病
where she was taken ill yesterday on the last leg of her European goodwill tour.

1007
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,920
外界传闻说她的病情可能很严重
This has given rise to rumors that her condition may be serious,

1008
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
这在她的国民之中造成了恐慌和焦虑的情绪
which is causing alarm and anxiety among the people in her country.

1009
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,010
- 明天再听新闻吧
- 好的
- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

1010
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,350
可以再给我倒点儿酒吗？
May I have a little more wine?

1011
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,640
真抱歉我没能给我们做顿晚饭
I'm sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner.

1012
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,310
你在学校学过怎么做饭吗？
Did you learn how in school?

1013
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,190
我的厨艺很棒的
I'm a good cook.

1014
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:26,860
我可以以此为生的
I could earn my living at it.

1015
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,900
我还会针线 清洁房屋和熨衣服
I can sew, too, and clean a house and iron.

1016
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,030
这些事情我都会
I learned to do all those things.

1017
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:35,360
我只是没机会为谁做这些事罢了
I just haven't had the chance to do it for anyone.

1018
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,370
噢 看来我该搬家了
Well, it looks like I'll have to move

1019
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,710
我得给自己找间带厨房的屋子了
and get myself a place with a kitchen.

1020
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,760
是的
Yes.

1021
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,860
我该走了 现在
I shall have to go now.

1022
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,130
安雅...
Anya...

1023
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,300
有些事我想告诉你
There's something that I want to tell you.

1024
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,720
别说了
No, please.

1025
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,270
什么都别说
Nothing.

1026
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,370
我必须换上衣服离开了
I must go and get dressed.

1027
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:51,200
请在下一个转角处停车
Stop at the next corner, please.

1028
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,370
好的
Okay.

1029
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,720
是这里吗？
Here?

1030
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,300
是的
Yes.

1031
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,350
我得离开你了 现在
I have to leave you now.

1032
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,900
我会走到那个转角然后转过去
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

1033
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,530
你必须留在车里然后离开
You must stay in the car and drive away.

1034
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:43,790
答应我过了转角就不要再看我
Promise not to watch me go beyond the corner.

1035
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:48,080
只管开车离开 别管我
Just drive away and leave me,

1036
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,710
就像我离开你那样
as I leave you.

1037
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,840
好吧
All right.

1038
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,930
我不知道该如何道别
I don't know how to say good-bye.

1039
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,440
我不知道该说什么
I can't think of any words.

1040
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,360
那就别说了
Don't try.

1041
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:14,010
公主殿下 24个小时 不可能什么都没发生
Your Royal Highness, 24 hours, they can't all be blank.

1042
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,300
当然不是
They are not.

1043
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,230
可我该怎么同国王和王后解释呢？
But what explanation am I to offer Their Majesties?

1044
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:26,350
我之前不舒服 现在我好多了
I was indisposed. I am better.

1045
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:33,990
殿下 您必须理解我得履行自己的职责
Ma'am, you must appreciate that I have my duty to perform,

1046
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:37,280
正如公主殿下也有她自己的职责
just as Your Royal Highness has her duty.

1047
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,990
阁下 我相信您会发现今后没必要
Your Excellency, I trust you will not find it necessary

1048
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,950
再说那样的话了
to use that word again.

1049
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:49,210
要是我完全意识不到自己对家人和国民还负有责任的话
Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country,

1050
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,830
今晚我就不会回来了
I would not have come back tonight,

1051
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,680
或者 应该说是 永远不会回来
or, indeed, ever again.

1053
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:12,850
好了 我知道我们今天的时间表排得相当满
And now, since I understand we have a very full schedule today,

1054
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,110
你们都可以退下了
you have my permission to withdraw.

1056
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,500
不用端牛奶还有饼干了
No milk and crackers.

1058
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,430
我没有什么吩咐了 谢谢 伯爵夫人
That will be all, thank you, Countess.

1059
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,150
真的吗？你真的办到了吗？
Is it true? Did you really get it?

1061
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:50,490
办到什么？
Did I get what?

1062
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,570
公主的料啊 独家采访 你办到了吗？
The princess story. The exclusive. Did you get it?

1063
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,820
不 没有 我没有办到
No, no, I didn't get it.

1064
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,700
什么？这不可能
What? But that's impossible.

1065
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,160
要喝杯咖啡或者别的吗？
Have a cup of coffee or something?

1066
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,490
- 乔 你可不能瞒着我
- 谁要瞒着你了？
- Joe, you can't hold out on me.
- Who's holding out on you?

1068
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,660
- 是你
- 你在胡说些什么？
- You are.
- What are you talking about?

1069
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,000
我都知道
I know too much.

1070
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,250
你先是走进我的办公室
First you come into my office

1072
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:06,170
然后说要对公主做个独家采访
and ask about an exclusive on the princess.

1073
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,710
接着 你就跑出去了
Next, you disappear.

1074
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:10,210
之后我从自己在大使馆的关系那里听说
Then I get the rumor from my contact at the embassy

1076
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,340
公主没有生病而是自己跑到城里来了
that the princess isn't sick at all and she's out on the town.

1077
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,800
你还算得上是新闻工作者吗？
What kind of a newspaperman are you?

1078
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,130
所有传到你耳朵里的毫无根据的传言你也信吗？
You believe every two-bit rumor that comes your way?

1079
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,720
嗯 还有很多其他的传闻
Yeah, and a lot of other rumors

1081
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,100
像是河边驳船上的舞会
about a shindig on a barge down by the river

1082
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:25,230
还有来自某国的8名秘密情务人员被捕
and the arrest of eight Secret Service men from a country which shall be nameless.

1085
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:28,350
之后就传出公主奇迹般康复的新闻
And then comes the news of the lady's miraculous recovery.

1086
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,980
现在都满天飞了
It all ads up.

1087
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,520
别给我抬杠 好抬高你手上料的价钱
And don't think by playing hard to get you'll raise the price of that story.

1088
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,110
交易就是交易
A deal's a deal.

1089
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:38,360
好了 快说吧 快说吧 你弄的料呢？
Now, come on, come on, where is that story?

1091
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,410
我手上没有什么料
I have no story.

1092
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,580
- 那之前你怎么会想到要...
- 乔！
- Then what was the idea of...
- Joe!

1094
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:49,910
- 伙计 等你们看到这些
- 艾文...
- Man, wait till you see these.
- Irving...

1095
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,040
你好 亨尼西先生 您来得正是时候
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy. You got here at the right time.

1097
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,750
- 艾文...
- 等你看了...
- Irving...
- Wait till you get a look...

1098
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:56,920
这是什么意思？
What's the idea?

1099
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,670
你跑这里来把东西在我的房间里洒得到处都是想干什么？
What do you mean charging in here and spilling things all over my place?

1100
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,800
谁洒得到处都是了？
Who's spilling?

1101
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,720
就是你 我之前就这样跟你说过一次了
You did. I spoke to you about that once before.

1102
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,550
你还记得吗？
Don't you remember?

1104
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:05,600
乔 看看我的裤子
Joe, look at my pants.

1105
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,720
噢 你最好进去吧裤子弄干 艾文
Yeah, you'd better come in here and dry them off, Irving.

1107
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,390
别胡说了
Nuts to that.

1108
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,480
- 嘿 他有没有跟你说起过史密蒂？
- 艾文...
- Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?
- Irving...

1109
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,690
史密蒂？
Smitty?

1110
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,890
- 亨尼西先生...
- 艾文...
- Mr. Hennessy...
- Irving...

1111
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,350
等到...
Wait till...

1112
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,730
你又来了 艾文
There you go again, Irving.

1113
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:21,690
乔
Joe.

1114
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,820
- 好吧 有什么话待会儿再说
- 听着...
- All right, save that till later.
- Listen...

1115
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,570
不管怎样 你来早了点儿 你干嘛不先回家去刮个胡子呢？
You're here early, anyway. Why don't you go home and shave?

1117
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,620
刮胡子？
Shave?

1118
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,330
是的 要不就在我同亨尼西先生谈完之前保持安静
Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.

1119
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,960
嘿 这到底是怎么回事？
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1120
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,080
你们两个在说什么？谁是史密蒂？
What are you two guys up to? Who's Smitty?

1122
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,290
他是我们认识的一个人 你没必要在意他
He's a guy that we met. You wouldn't care for him.

1124
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,500
要是我想看看呢？
What am I supposed to look at?

1125
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:44,340
不用了 只不过是些艾文的美女照 你不会喜欢的
No, just a couple of Irving's dames. You wouldn't like them.

1126
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,970
也许你会喜欢的
Maybe you would.

1127
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:49,260
别岔开话题 昨天你走进我办公室的时候...
Don't change the subject. When you came back into my office yesterday...

1129
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,390
是的 我知道 昨天下午 我以为自己掌握了个好料
Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon, I thought I had a good lead,

1130
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:52,930
可我弄错了
but I was wrong.

1131
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,980
事情就是这样 什么料都没有
That's all there is to it. There is no story.

1132
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,850
好吧
Okay.

1133
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,690
她今天举行记者招待会 同样的时间 同样的地点
She's holding the press interview today. Same time, same place.

1135
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,280
也许这次你能弄到料
Maybe that's one story you can get.

1136
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:09,950
你还欠我500美元！
And you owe me 500 bucks!

1138
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:11,990
从我的薪水里扣吧 每周50美元
Take it out of my salary, 50 bucks a week.

1140
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,820
别以为我不会
Don't think I won't.

1141
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,790
嘿 怎么了？
Hey, what gives?

1143
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:20,460
有人给我们出更高的价吗？
Have we had a better offer?

1144
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:24,790
艾文 我不知道该怎么跟你说 可是...
Irving, I don't know just how to tell you this, but...

1146
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,170
我先坐下来再说吧
Wait till I sit down.

1147
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:35,300
好了 关于这次的料还有这些照片
Well, in regard to the story that goes with these,

1148
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,930
没有什么料
there is no story.

1149
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:42,140
为什么没有？
Why not?

1151
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,480
我是说 我之前没有考虑清楚
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1152
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:02,950
嘿 照片洗出来相当不错 你想看看吗？
Hey, the pictures came out pretty well. You want to have a look at them?

1153
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,470
怎么样 从这么小的底片洗出来的？
How about a blowup from a negative that size?

1155
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:22,680
- 这是她的第一支烟
- 噢 是啊 在Rocca咖啡馆
- That's her first cigarette.
- Oh, yeah. At Rocca's.

1157
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,760
嘿 诚实之口
Hey, the mouth of truth.

1158
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,850
噢 你想知道我给这张想的标题是什么吗？
Oh, you want to know the caption I had in mind there?

1159
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:30,600
“闯入<font color=#FF7F00>[公主生活]</font>的理发师”
"Barber cuts in."

1160
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,900
噢 这张我觉得应该排在最醒目的位置
Well, here's the one I figured would be the key shot for the layout.

1161
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:38,190
“愿望成真之墙”
"The wall where wishes come true."

1163
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,820
乔 这主意不错
Joe, that's good.

1164
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,200
先是那些照片 然后就是愿望墙的照片
Lead off with that, then follow up with the wishes.

1166
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:45,910
这是我从档案中找出来的
I dug that up out of the file.

1168
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,990
“公主检阅警察”
"Princess inspects police."

1169
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,200
耶
Yeah.

1171
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,210
“警察检阅公主”
"Police inspects princess."

1173
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,040
怎么样？
How about it?

1174
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,090
- 乔 我有个好东西要给你
- 很好...
- Joe, I got a topper for you.
- Pretty good...

1176
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:00,670
喔！
Wow!

1177
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,130
- 这够冲击吧？
- 简直太棒了！
- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1179
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,010
这够冲击吧 乔？
Is that a shot, Joe?

1180
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,220
“保镖惨败”
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1181
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,260
耶 不 叫这个怎么样？
Yeah. No, how about this?

1182
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:10,260
“加冕”
"Crowned head."

1183
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:13,350
说得太对了！真是...乔 你说得...
I get it! That's... Joe, you got...

1184
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,730
她就是供人评论的对象 乔
She's fair game, Joe.

1186
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,030
对公主怎么报导都可以
It's always open season on princesses.

1187
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,660
你一定是疯了
You must be out of your mind.

1188
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,780
是的 我知道 不过...
Yeah, I know, but...

1189
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:36,330
好了 听着 如果你打算卖掉这些照片的话我也阻止不了你
Well, look, I can't prevent you from selling the pictures if you want to.

1190
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:39,580
- 你可以拿它们卖个好价钱
- 没错！
- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah!

1192
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,970
你这是要去记者招待会吗？
You going to the interview?

1194
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,390
你去吗？
Are you going?

1195
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:53,010
是的 这是我的任务 不是吗？
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1196
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,890
是的
Yeah.

1197
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,480
再见
I'll see you.

1199
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:19,160
这儿虽然不怎么样 但这就是别人的家
It ain't much, but it's home.
