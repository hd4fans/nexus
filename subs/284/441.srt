别说了！
{\fs11}Stop!

100
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,570
- 我的上帝啊！
- 别说了！别说了！别说了！
{\fs11}- Good heavens!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

101
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,070
没事 亲爱的 没洒出来
{\fs11}It's all right, dear. It didn't spill.

102
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
我才不在乎它洒没洒
{\fs11}I don't care if it spilled or not.

103
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,200
就算我淹死在里边我也不在乎！
{\fs11}I don't care if I drowned in it!

104
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,660
亲爱的 你病了
{\fs11}My dear, you're ill.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,830
我派人去把博纳科温医生请来
{\fs11}I'll send for Dr. Bonnachoven.

106
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,340
我不要博纳科温医生！就让我安静的死掉吧
{\fs11}I don't want Dr. Bonnachoven! Please let me die in peace.

107
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
你不会死的
{\fs11}You're not dying.

108
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,800
别管我！
{\fs11}Leave me!

109
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,630
- 别管我！
- 你就是有些紧张了 控制你的情绪 安
{\fs11}- Leave me!
- It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

110
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
我不要！
{\fs11}I don't want to!

111
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,390
公主殿下！
{\fs11}Your Highness!

112
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,600
我去把博纳科温医生找来
{\fs11}I'll get Dr. Bonnachoven.

113
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,100
这没用的
{\fs11}It's no use.

114
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,100
在他赶到这里前我就会死掉
{\fs11}I'll be dead before he gets here.

115
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,150
她已经睡着了
{\fs11}She's asleep.

116
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
3分钟前她还是歇斯底里的 医生
{\fs11}She was in hysterics three minutes ago, Doctor.

117
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,410
您睡着了吗 殿下？
{\fs11}Are you asleep, ma'am?

118
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,540
没有！
{\fs11}No!

119
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,420
我只打扰您一小会儿 公主殿下
{\fs11}I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness a moment.

120
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
我真的很惭愧 博纳科温医生
{\fs11}I'm very ashamed, Dr. Bonnachoven.

121
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,170
突然间 我就哭起来了
{\fs11}Sudenly, I was crying.

122
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,220
哭 是再平常不过的事了
{\fs11}To cry, a perfectly normal thing to do.

123
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,930
最重要的是让她在出席记者招待会的时候能够冷静 放松 医生
{\fs11}It's most important she be calm and relaxed for the press conference, Doctor.

124
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,810
别担心 医生
{\fs11}Don't worry, Doctor.

125
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,640
我会冷静 放松的
{\fs11}I'll be calm and relaxed.

126
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,810
我会欠身 微笑的
{\fs11}I'll bow, and I'll smile.

127
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,390
我会改善贸易关系 还有...
{\fs11}I'll improve trade relations, and...

128
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,690
她又这样了 给她点儿什么药 医生 快点
{\fs11}There she goes again. Give her something, Doctor, please.

129
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,400
请把她的衣袖卷起来
<font color=#FF7F00>[请注意将军的表演]</font>
{\fs11}Uncover her arm, please.

130
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,610
那是什么？
{\fs11}What's that?

131
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,160
镇定促睡眠的药
{\fs11}Sleep and calm.

132
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
这会让公主殿下您感到放松并感到些许愉快的
{\fs11}This will relax you and make Your Highness feel a little happy.

133
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,490
这是一种新药 没有任何副作用
{\fs11}It's a new drug, quite harmless.

134
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,500
好了
{\fs11}There.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,130
我没感觉有什么不同
{\fs11}I don't feel any different.

136
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,510
你会的 要过一阵才会起效
{\fs11}You will. It may take a little time to take hold.

137
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,880
现在 快躺下吧
{\fs11}Just, now, lie back.

138
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,550
能给我留一盏灯别关 好吗？
{\fs11}Can I keep just one light on?

139
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,010
当然可以
{\fs11}Of course.

140
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,850
我最懂得的就是遵照您的心意了
{\fs11}Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while.

141
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,350
谢谢您 医生
{\fs11}Thank you, Doctor.

142
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,070
噢 将军他！医生 快来！
{\fs11}Oh, The General! Doctor, quick!

143
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,860
我已经完全没事了
{\fs11}I'm perfectly all right.

144
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,870
晚安 殿下
{\fs11}Good night, ma'am.

145
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,200
- 晚安 殿下
- 晚安 医生
{\fs11}- Good night, ma'am.

152
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,780

再赌500
{\fs11}500 more.

154
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,580
牌都不用看
{\fs11}Without looking.

155
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,920
500 你要跟我就得出1,000
{\fs11}500, and I'll raise you 1,000.

156

{\fs11}Two pairs.

157
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,970
我拿的是三张7
{\fs11}I got three shy little sevens.

158
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,770
三条 你们可以光屁股回家了 傻瓜们
{\fs11}A nervous straight. Come home, you fools.

{\fs11}Not bad. That's 10 bucks.

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,110
再来一把
{\fs11}One more round,

162
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,860
我要把你们赢个干净
{\fs11}and I'm going to throw you gents right out in the snow.

163
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,240
什么 干嘛这么说？
{\fs11}Say, what is this?

164
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,110
我还要早起呢
{\fs11}I got to get up early.

165
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,570
我约了公主殿下
{\fs11}Date with Her Royal Highness,

166
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,070
她会做出优雅的姿势给我照的
{\fs11}who will graciously pose for some pictures.

167
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,410
你说什么 早起？我收到的邀请函上写的是11:45
{\fs11}What do you mean, early? My personal invitation says 11:45.

168
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
你赢了就不想玩了吗？
{\fs11}Couldn't be anything to do with the fact that you're ahead?

169
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,290
应该是吧
{\fs11}It could.

170
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,040
我输惨了 这是我最后5,000里拉了
{\fs11}It works out fine for me. This is my last 5,000,

171
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,760

{\fs11}All right, a little seven-card stud.

176
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,850

{\fs11}Okay with me.

177

185
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,880
你也很迷人
{\fs11}Charmed, too.

186
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,100
你可以坐下了
{\fs11}You may sit down.

187
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,310
我想你最好坐起来
{\fs11}I think you'd better sit up.

188
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,770
你这年纪也小得连警察都不会收容你
{\fs11}You're much too young to get picked up by the police.

189
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,400
- 警察？
- 没错 警察
{\fs11}- Police?
- Yep. Police.

190
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,280
2:15回来换衣服 2:45...
{\fs11}2:15 and back here to change. 2:45...

191
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,910
要知道 酒量不行的人就不该喝酒
{\fs11}You know, people who can't handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

192
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,290
“若是我死去 眠于地下 但只要听见你的声音”
{\fs11}"If I were dead and buried and I heard your voice

193

“即便在青草之下 我那已化为泥土的心也会欣慰的”
{\fs11}"beneath the sod my heart of dust would still rejoice."

194
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,500
你知道这首诗吗？
{\fs11}Do you know that poem?

195
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,010
那你知道什么？
{\fs11}What do you know?

196
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,300
你读书又多 穿得也好
{\fs11}You're well-read, well-dressed,

197
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,850
却在大街上打瞌睡
{\fs11}snoozing away in a public street.

198
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,980
你不介意做个解释吧？
{\fs11}Would you care to make a statement?

199
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,600
这个世界需要的是让甜美和庄重重新回归到
{\fs11}What the world needs is a return to sweetness and decency

200
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,230
青年人的灵魂里...
{\fs11}in the souls of its young men and...

201
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,410
是的 我绝对同意你的说法 不过...
{\fs11}Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more, but...

202
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,170
喝点咖啡吧 这样你就会好多了
{\fs11}Get yourself some coffee. You'll be all right.

203
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,360
听着 这辆出租车你坐吧
{\fs11}Look, you take the cab.

204
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,120
快点 上车去 回家
{\fs11}Come on, climb in the cab and go home.

205
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,040
- 真开心
- 你有带钱吗？
{\fs11}- So happy.
- You got any money?

206
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,580
我从不带钱
{\fs11}Never carry money.

207
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,420
这真不是个好习惯
{\fs11}That's a bad habit.

208
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,050
好吧 我送你 走吧
{\fs11}All right. I'll drop you off. Come on.

209
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,760
这是辆出租车！
{\fs11}It's a taxi!

210
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,180
噢 这可不是超级酋长<font color=#FF7F00>[1935-1974 洛杉矶-芝加哥特快列车]</font>
{\fs11}Well, it's not the Super Chief.

211
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,140
你们要到哪儿？
{\fs11}Where are we going?

212
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,890
你住哪儿？
{\fs11}Where do you live?

213
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,520
圆形竞技场
{\fs11}Colosseum.

214
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,150
噢 得了 你还没那么醉呢
{\fs11}Now, come on. You're not that drunk.

215
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,360
你真是聪明 我一点儿都没醉
{\fs11}You're so smart. I'm not drunk at all.

216
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,820
我只是非常开心罢了
{\fs11}I'm just being very happy.

217
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,360
现在 坐好 别又睡着了 来吧
{\fs11}There, now, don't go to sleep again. Come on.

218
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,330

294
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,370
一切都会好起来的 明白吗？

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,860
你用不着忙活了 我这里就有一份副本
{\fs11}Don't disturb yourself. I have a copy here.

337
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,530
公主殿下对建立欧洲联盟有何看法？
{\fs11}How did Her Highness react to the idea of a European federation?

338
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,530
她认为还不错
{\fs11}She thought it was just fine.

339
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,200
是吗？
{\fs11}She did?

340
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,500
嗯 她认为这将产生两方面的影响
{\fs11}Well, she thought that there'd be two effects.

341
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
两方面？
{\fs11}Two?

342
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,580
直接还有间接的影响
{\fs11}The direct and the indirect.

343
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,170
说得真不错
{\fs11}Remarkable.

344
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,670
当然 她认为间接影响没有直接影响来得那么直接
{\fs11}Naturally, she thought that the indirect would not be as direct as the direct.

345
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,260
- 就是说 来得没有那么快
- 不 不 不 不
{\fs11}- That is, not right away.
- No, no, no, no.

346
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,050
当然 要过段时间 噢 谁知道呢
{\fs11}Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

347
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,730
噢 噢 噢 这说法很老练啊
{\fs11}Well, well, well, that was a shrewd observation.

348
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,060
他们在耍你 知道吗 这些皇室的小家伙们
{\fs11}They fool you, you know, these royal kids.

349
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
他们可不像我们想的那样只会在舞会上跳舞
{\fs11}They've got a lot more on the ball than we suspect.

350
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,110
她对各国今后的友好关系怎么看呢？
{\fs11}How did she feel about the future friendship of nations?

351
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,950
要看年轻人
{\fs11}Youth.

352
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,030
她认为年轻人
{\fs11}She felt that the youth of the world

353
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,450
必将引导世界走向更美好的未来
{\fs11}must lead the way to a better world.

354
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,920
蛮新颖的
{\fs11}Original.

355
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,670
顺便问下 她当时穿的什么？
{\fs11}By the way, what was she wearing?

356
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,710
你是说 她当时着的什么装吗？
{\fs11}You mean, what did she have on?

357
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,130
还能是什么意思
{\fs11}That's usually what it means.

358
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
怎么了？这里对你来说有点儿太热了吗？
{\fs11}What's the matter? Is it a little warm in here for you?

359
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,970
不 没有 我刚跑回来的 就这样
{\fs11}No, no. I just hurried over here, that's all.

360
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,760
当然了 拿着这样不得了的料<font color=#FF7F00>[自然要跑快点儿]</font>
{\fs11}Naturally, with a story of these dimensions.

361
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,180
你刚说她穿的是灰色的？
{\fs11}Did you say she was wearing gray?

362
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,520
不 我没那么说过
{\fs11}No, I didn't say that.

363
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,060
嗯 她通常都穿灰色的
{\fs11}Well, she usually wears gray.

364
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,400
噢 是灰色的
{\fs11}Well, it was a kind of a gray.

365
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,530
我想我知道你说的是哪件连衣裙 衣领是金色的那件
{\fs11}I think I know the dress you mean. It has a gold collar.

366
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,070
就是那件 就是那件 没错
{\fs11}That's the one. That's the one, yeah.

367
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,320
我不知道该怎么去描述它 不过...
{\fs11}I didn't know exactly how to describe it, but that's...

368
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,910
我想你已经把它描述得很清楚了
{\fs11}I think you described it very well,

369
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,240
事实上公主殿下
{\fs11}in view of the fact that Her Highness

370
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,910
今天凌晨3:00突染疾病
{\fs11}was taken violently ill at 3:00 this morning,

371
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,870
正躺在床上发着高烧
{\fs11}put to bed with a high fever,

372
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,710
她今天所有的预订活动全部都取消了！
{\fs11}and has had all her appointments for today canceled in toto!

373
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
全部？
{\fs11}In toto?

374
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,800
是的 布兰德利先生 全部
{\fs11}Yes, Mr. Bradley, in toto.

375
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,430
这还真有点儿难咽<font color=#FF7F00>[之前从门外秘书顺的饼干]</font>
{\fs11}It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

376
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,100
- 鉴于你刚从她那儿回来
- 没错
{\fs11}- In view of the fact that you just left her,
- of course.

377
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,760
你看看这些 布兰德利先生
{\fs11}But here it is, Mr. Bradley,

378
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,310
罗马所有的报纸头版都登了
{\fs11}all over the front page of every newspaper in Rome.

379
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,390
好吧 好吧 我睡过头了 谁都会睡过头的
{\fs11}All right, all right, I overslept. It can happen to anybody.

380
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,980
要是你起得够早 有时间读下今天早上的报纸
{\fs11}If you only got up early enough to read a morning paper,

381
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,020
你也许不会看到什么新闻事件
{\fs11}you might discover little news events,

382
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,190
或是娱乐大众的八卦
{\fs11}little items of general interest

383
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,360
但至少不会让人看过之后被
{\fs11}that might prevent someone in the future from getting immersed

384
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,320
这样一个镀着金的 精心包装 闪闪发光的谎话骗得晕头转向
{\fs11}in such a gold-plated, triple-decked, star-spangled lie

385
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,120
比如你刚才跟我说的那个
{\fs11}as you have just told me.

386
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,490
如果我是你 我就会试着干点儿别的工作
{\fs11}If I were you, I would try some other line of business,

387
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
比如床垫测试
{\fs11}like mattress testing.

388
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,080
这就是公主？
{\fs11}Is this the princess?

389
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,500
是的 布兰德利先生 这就是公主
{\fs11}Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

390
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,590
不是安妮 奥克莱 桃勒西 拉莫 也不是蒋介石夫人
<font color=#FF7F00>[安妮 奥克莱 1860-1926 美国著名神枪手 首位美国女明星]</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>[桃勒西 拉莫 1914-1996 美国演员及歌手]</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>[Chiang Kai-Shek 蒋介石 曾有某部二战书中一直译为蒋凯申]</font>
{\fs11}It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour, or Madam Chiang Kai-Shek.
<font color=#FF7F00>[Annie Oakley 1860-1926 American sharpshooter the first American female superstar]</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>[Dorothy Lamour 1914-1996 American actress and singer]</font>

391
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,670
好好看清楚她的样子
{\fs11}Take a good look at her.

392
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,260
说不定哪天你还得采访她
{\fs11}You might be interviewing her again someday.

393
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,670
我被炒了吗？
{\fs11}Am I fired?

394
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,550
没有 你没有被炒
{\fs11}No, you're not fired.

395
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,350
我要炒你的时候 你都不用问
{\fs11}When I want to fire you, you won't have to ask.

396
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,000
你就知道自己被炒掉了！
<font color=#FF7F00>[即登报 甚至可能在讣告栏：布兰德利 你被炒了！]</font>
{\fs11}You'll know you're fired!

397
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,520
那家伙疯了
{\fs11}The man's mad.

398
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,380
乔万尼 我是乔 布兰德利
{\fs11}Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

399
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,880
现在 仔细听好了 我要你马上去我的房间
{\fs11}Now, listen carefully. I want you to hurry up to my place

400
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,970
去看看是不是还有人睡在那儿
{\fs11}and see if there's somebody there asleep.

401
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,430
好吧 乔先生 我这就去看
{\fs11}Say, Mr. Joe, I look.

402
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
你等着
{\fs11}You wait.

403
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
乔先生？
{\fs11}Mr. Joe?

404
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,240
我在！喂 喂 喂 跟我说 跟我说
{\fs11}Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me. Tell me.

405
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,170
乔万尼 我爱你 好了 听着
{\fs11}Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

406
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,710
什么事 乔先生？
{\fs11}Yes, Mr. Joe?

407
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,250
拿把枪？
{\fs11}A gun?

408
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
不！
{\fs11}No!

409
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,800
好吧 拿把枪 拿把刀 拿什么都行
{\fs11}Yes, a gun, a knife, anything,

410
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,550
但别让任何人进出
{\fs11}but nobody goes in and nobody goes out.

411
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,930
好的
{\fs11}Okay.

412
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,690
你还没走？
{\fs11}You still here?

413
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,240
要是对这个女人真的做个采访值多少钱？
{\fs11}How much would a real interview with this dame be worth?

414
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,910
你是指公主殿下吗？
{\fs11}Are you referring to Her Highness?

415
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,410
我说的不是安妮 奥克莱 桃勒西 拉莫 或者...
{\fs11}I'm not referring to Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour or...

416
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,450
多少钱？
{\fs11}How much?

417
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
你问这干什么？你能采访到的机会...
{\fs11}What do you care? You got about as much chance as...

418
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,080
我知道 可要是我办到了 值多少钱？
{\fs11}I know, but if I did, how much would it be worth?

419
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
光简单的跟她谈下世界局势就值250
{\fs11}Just a plain talk on world conditions might be worth 250.

420
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,300
她对服装的品味 当然 就更值钱了 应该值1,000吧
{\fs11}Her views on clothes, of course, would be worth a lot more, maybe 1,000.

421
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
- 美元？
- 美元
{\fs11}- Dollars?
- Dollars.

422
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,390
我说的是她对所有事的看法
{\fs11}I'm talking about her views on everything.

423
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,060
公主私密的渴望
{\fs11}The private and secret longings of a princess.

424
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,560
她内心深处的想法
{\fs11}Her innermost thoughts,

425
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:24,730
将透露给你的罗马通讯记者 这是私人的 面对面的 独家采访
{\fs11}as revealed to your Rome correspondent in a private, personal, exclusive interview.

426
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,860
这点子不行吗 嗯？
{\fs11}Can't use it, huh?

427
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,620
我就知道你不会喜欢的
{\fs11}I didn't think you'd like it.

428
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,000
过来
{\fs11}Come here.

429
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,920
还有 爱情观了 我想？
{\fs11}Love angle, too, I suppose?

430
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,630
详细到所有的爱情观
{\fs11}Practically all love angle.

431
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,670
要附照片
{\fs11}With pictures.

432
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,340
可以的话 多少钱？
{\fs11}Could be. How much?

433
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,590
这么详细的料对任何通讯社来说都值5,000
{\fs11}That particular story will be worth five grand to any news service.

434
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,680
不过告诉我 布兰德利先生 要是你清醒的话
{\fs11}But tell me, Mr. Bradley, if you are sober,

435
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,890
你要怎样去完成这个不可思议的采访？
{\fs11}just how you are going to obtain this fantastic interview.

436
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,480
我打算装扮成一支体温计进入她的病房
{\fs11}I plan to enter her sickroom disguised as a thermometer.

437
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,940
你说的是5,000？我要和你握手约定
{\fs11}You said five grand? I want you to shake on that.

438
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,780
你知道吗 当然 今天公主殿下是躺在床上
{\fs11}And you realize, of course, Her Highness is in bed today

439
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,820
但明天就要离开去雅典了？
{\fs11}and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

440
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
知道
{\fs11}Yep.

441
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,950
既然这样 我还想再跟你打个赌
{\fs11}Now, I'd like to make a little side bet with you.

442
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,870
500 赌你弄不回来那份料
{\fs11}500 says you don't come up with the story.

443
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,330
你看那个做什么？
{\fs11}What are you looking at that for?

444
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
我只是想看看现在什么时候了
{\fs11}I just want to see what time it is.

445
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,290
- 嗯？
- 看下今天几号了
{\fs11}- Huh?
- What day it is.

446
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,670
就这么说定了！
{\fs11}It's a deal!

447
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,800
我们握手吧
{\fs11}Now I'd like you to shake.

448
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,600
在我看来 你这500已经是我的了
{\fs11}Let's see, you're into me for about 500 now.

449
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,810
要是你输了 你就欠我1,000
{\fs11}When you lose this bet, you'll owe me 1,000.

450
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,520
为什么 你这卑鄙的骗子 我当然会赢你
{\fs11}Why, you poor sucker, I'll practically own you.

451
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,100
到现在你已经套了我好多年了
{\fs11}You have practically owned me for a couple of years now.

452
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,480
不过现在都结束了
{\fs11}But that's all over.

453
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,810
我会赢了那笔钱
{\fs11}I'm going to win that money,

454
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,650
然后 我会用它给自己买张回纽约的单程机票
{\fs11}and with it, I'm gonna buy me a one-way ticket back to New York.

455
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,240
接着说 接着说 我就爱听你发牢骚
{\fs11}Go on, go on, I love to hear you whine.

456
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,450
等我到了一家真正的新闻编辑部的时候 我会很高兴想到
{\fs11}And when I'm back in a real newsroom, I'll enjoy thinking about you,

457
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,530
你坐在这儿 手里皮带那头的项圈里什么也没有
{\fs11}sitting here with an empty leash in your hands

458
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,080
再没人会在你面前瑟瑟发抖
{\fs11}and nobody to twitch for you.

459
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,290
再见了 鸽子！<font color=#FF7F00>[鸽子 咕咕咕 话多且无意义]</font>
{\fs11}So long, pigeon!

460
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[知道意大利为什么出黑手党了吧？]</font>

461
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,270
嘿 乔 你知道什么吗？
{\fs11}Hey, Joe. What you know?

462
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,440
一切都还好吗 乔万尼？
{\fs11}Is everything okay, Giovanni?

463
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,900
没人来找她 她也没出去
{\fs11}Nobody she's come. Nobody she's go.

464
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,990
绝对没人进出过
{\fs11}Absolutely nobody.

465
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,870
干得漂亮 太谢谢了
{\fs11}Swell. Thanks a lot.

466
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,000
乔万尼...
{\fs11}Giovanni...

467
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,120
你想赚点儿钱吗？
{\fs11}How would you like to make some money?

468
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,210
- 钱？
- 是的
{\fs11}- Money?

469
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,460

{\fs11}That's the stuff. Now, look, I've got a sure thing.

两天之内让你的钱翻一倍
{\fs11}Double your money back in two days.

471
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,590
让我的钱翻一倍？
{\fs11}Double my money?

472
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,390
是的 嗯 我需要点儿启动资金
{\fs11}Yeah, well, I need a little investment capital to swing the deal.

473
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,390
好了 要是你能借我一点儿钱...
{\fs11}Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash...

474
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,520
你还欠我两个月的房租呢
{\fs11}You owing me two months' rent,

475
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,110
你还想我借钱给你？
{\fs11}and you want me to lend you money?

476
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,650
- 是的
- 不行
{\fs11}- Yeah.
- No.

477
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,990
明天你会后悔的
{\fs11}Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

478
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[这个动作让译者想起一个词：斯德哥尔摩综合症]</font>

479
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,590
公主殿下？
{\fs11}Your Highness?

480
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,100
公主殿下？
{\fs11}Your Royal Highness?

481
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,100
嗯 怎么了？
{\fs11}Yes, what is it?

482
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,150
亲爱的博纳科温医生...
{\fs11}Dear Dr. Bonnachoven...

483
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:40,290
是我 是的 噢 你没事了 好多了 你想要点儿什么吗？
{\fs11}Sure, yes, well, you're fine. Much better. Is there anything you want?

484
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,830
好多东西
{\fs11}So many things.

485
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,580
- 是吗？那好 跟医生说吧
- 好...
{\fs11}- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.
- So...

486
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,000
把一切都告诉医生吧
{\fs11}Tell the good doctor everything.

487
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,670
我梦见 我梦见
{\fs11}I dreamt, and I dreamt.

488
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,420
什么？好了 你梦见什么了？
{\fs11}Yes? Well, what did you dream?

489
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,810
我梦见自己睡在街道上 然后来了一个年轻的男人
{\fs11}I dreamt I was asleep in the street, and a young man came.

490
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,270
他长得高大又强壮 而且他对我很有意
{\fs11}He was tall and strong, and he was so mean to me.

491
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,570
是吗？
{\fs11}He was?

492
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,740
那感觉太好了
{\fs11}It was wonderful.

493
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,690
早上好
{\fs11}Good morning.

494
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
<font color=#FF7F00>[注意嘴角那微微一颤 NICE!]</font>

495
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,190
博纳科温医生呢？
{\fs11}Where's Dr. Bonnachoven?

496
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,570
我恐怕自己认识的人里没叫那个名字的
{\fs11}I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.

497
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,570
刚才同我说话的不是他吗？
{\fs11}Wasn't I talking to him just now?

498
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,030
我恐怕不是
{\fs11}Afraid not.

499
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,080
我是出了什么事故吗？
{\fs11}Have I had an accident?

500
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,040
不是
{\fs11}No.

501
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,250
我可以坐起来吗？<font color=#FF7F00>[原文意思认为自己出了意外身体不能动]</font>
{\fs11}Quite safe for me to sit up?

502
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,130
完全可以
{\fs11}Perfect.

503
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,310
谢谢
{\fs11}Thank you.

504
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,780
这些是你的吗？<font color=#FF7F00>[这一段的表演相当精彩]</font>
{\fs11}Are these yours?

505
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,950
你丢了什么吗？
{\fs11}Did you lose something?

506
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:57,870
没有
{\fs11}No.

507
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,710
你能告诉我 我这是在什么地方吗？
{\fs11}Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am?

508
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,920
噢 让您见笑了 这是我的公寓
{\fs11}Well, this is what is laughingly known as my apartment.

509
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,550
你是强行把我带到这儿来的吗？
{\fs11}Did you bring me here by force?

510
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,260
不 不 不 恰恰相反
{\fs11}No, no, no. Quite the contrary.

511
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,350
我整晚都在这里 一个人？
{\fs11}Have I been here all night, alone?

512
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,940
要是不算上我的话 是的
{\fs11}If you don't count me, yes.

513
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,520
这么说我整晚都同你在这里？
{\fs11}So I've spent the night here with you?

514
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,320
噢 好了 我的确不知道自己该怎么说
{\fs11}Well, now, I don't know that I'd use those words, exactly,

515
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,370
不过从某种角度上来说 是的
{\fs11}but from a certain angle, yes.

516
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
<font color=#FF7F00>[这一段的面部表情 SO NICE!]</font>

517

<font color=#FF7F00>[亲爱的 那颗犬齿算是龅牙吗？请脑残粉务必恕译者无罪]</font>

518
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,970
你好
{\fs11}How do you do?

519
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,340
你好
{\fs11}How do you do?

520
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,010
- 你是...
- 布兰德利 乔 布兰德利
{\fs11}- And you are...
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

521
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,100
很高兴认识你
{\fs11}Delighted.

522
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,810
你不会知道能认识您我有多么高兴
{\fs11}You don't know how delighted I am to meet you.

523
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,600
你可以坐下了
{\fs11}You may sit down.

524
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,480
非常感谢<font color=#FF7F00>[流氓 你就没看人家手指的哪边吗？]</font>
{\fs11}Thank you very much.

525

你叫什么名字？
{\fs11}What's your name?

526

527
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,660
谢谢 安雅
{\fs11}Thank you, Anya.

528
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,830
你要来杯咖啡吗？
{\fs11}Would you like a cup of coffee?

529
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,500
- 现在什么时候了？
- 快1:30了
{\fs11}- What time is it?
- About 1:30.

530
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,340
1:30！我必须换上衣服离开了！
{\fs11}1:30! I must get dressed and go!

531
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,340
为什么？你这么急为什么？时间还多着呢
{\fs11}Why? What's your hurry? There's lots of time.

532
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,180
不 没时间了 我给你带来的麻烦已经够多了
{\fs11}No, there isn't, and I've been quite enough trouble to you as it is.

533
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,510
麻烦？
{\fs11}Trouble?

534
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,220
我不觉得你有什么麻烦到我
{\fs11}You're not what I'd call trouble.

535
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,350
我没有吗？
{\fs11}I'm not?

536
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,940
我去给你准备沐浴
{\fs11}I'll run a bath for you.

537
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,580
你可以进去了
{\fs11}There you are.

538
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,580
现在我们开始
{\fs11}Here we go now.

539
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,210
就这样别动 姿势很好
{\fs11}There you are. That does it.

540
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,590
别拉那么紧 好吗？
{\fs11}Give me a little slack, will you?

541
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,920
艾文！你为什么不接电话？
{\fs11}Irving! Why don't you answer the phone?

542
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,470
听着 我是乔
{\fs11}Look, this is Joe.

543
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,590
艾文 你能在5分钟内赶过来吗？
{\fs11}Irving, can you get over here in about five minutes?

544
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,260
不行 我现在过不来 乔 我正忙着呢
{\fs11}No, I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy.

545
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,100
不行
{\fs11}No.

546
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,810

{\fs11}Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

547
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,810
去换上你的下一套服装 好吗 亲爱的？独木舟
{\fs11}Go and get into your next outfit, will you, honey? The canoe.

548
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,310
是什么样的独家新闻 乔？
{\fs11}What kind of a scoop, Joe?

549
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,520
听着 艾文 在电话里我可不能说
{\fs11}Look, Irving, I can't talk over the telephone.

550
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,690
要是说漏了一个词
{\fs11}One word in the wrong quarter,

551
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,150
这事就会捅上天去
{\fs11}and this whole thing might blow sky-high.

552
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,030
这是上头版的料 我只能告诉你这么多了
{\fs11}It's front-page stuff. That's all I can tell you.

553
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,280
可能是政治性的 或者可能是件轰动的丑闻
{\fs11}It might be political or it might be a sensational scandal.

554
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,820
我还不确定 总之是猛料
{\fs11}I'm not sure which, but it's a big story.

555
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,910
需要附上些照片
{\fs11}It's got to have pictures.

556
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,790
可我现在不能过来 乔 我很忙...
{\fs11}But I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy...

557
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,290
我很忙现在 半小时后我还要去Rocca咖啡馆同弗朗西斯卡见面
{\fs11}I'm busy now, and I'm meeting Francesca at Rocca's in a half an hour.

558
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,430
听不懂
{\fs11}Don't understand.

559
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
你在这里
{\fs11}There you are.

560
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,540
我在看附近的那些人们
{\fs11}I was looking at all the people out here.

561
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,500
住在这样的地方一定很有意思
{\fs11}It must be fun to live in a place like this.

562
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,250
是的 有时候是很有意思
{\fs11}Yeah, it has its moments.

563
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,670
我可以向你介绍每间公寓的主人
{\fs11}I can give you a running commentary on each apartment.

564
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,090
我必须走了
{\fs11}I must go.

565
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,420
我只是在等着和你说声再见
{\fs11}I only waited to say good-bye.

566
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,720
再见？为什么 我们才刚认识
{\fs11}Good-bye? Why, we've only just met.

567
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,560
- 要吃点儿早餐吗？
- 抱歉 我没时间了
{\fs11}- How about some breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

568
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,480
什么都不吃就急着走 那一定是非常重要的约会
{\fs11}It must be a pretty important date to run off without eating.

569
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,190
是的
{\fs11}It is.

570
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,860
好吧 我陪你去 不管你去哪儿
{\fs11}Well, I'll go along with you, wherever you are going.

571
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,150
没关系 谢谢 我自己能去
{\fs11}That's all right, thank you. I can find the place.

572
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,910
谢谢你让我睡在你的床上
{\fs11}Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.

573
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,370
没关系的 这不算什么
{\fs11}That's all right. Think nothing of it.

574
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,330
你真是太体贴了
{\fs11}It was very considerate of you.

575

01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,810
噢 你不会无缘无故就从学校偷跑出来吧
{\fs11}Well, you don't just run away from school for nothing.

672
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,360
我本想就偷跑出来一两个小时
{\fs11}I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

673
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,740
他们昨晚给我用了一些让我睡觉的药
{\fs11}They gave me something last night to make me sleep.

674
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,700
我明白了
{\fs11}I see.

675
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,530
我现在最好还是乘出租车回去了

{\fs11}why don't you take a little time for yourself?

678
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,210
那就再玩一个小时吧
{\fs11}Maybe another hour.

679
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,880
生活充满了未知数 玩个一整天吧
{\fs11}Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

你想都想不到的
{\fs11}You can't imagine.

683
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,300
我想一整天都做自己喜欢的事情
{\fs11}I'd like to do just whatever I like the whole day long.

684
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,890
你是说 像是剪短头发 吃冰淇淋这样的事情？
{\fs11}You mean, things like having your hair cut, eating gelato?

685
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:49,940
是的 我想坐在路边咖啡馆 看商店橱窗里的东西
{\fs11}Yes, and I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe and look in shop windows,

686
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,360
在雨中漫步
{\fs11}walk in the rain.

687
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,940
做一些好玩 甚至有些刺激的事
{\fs11}Have fun, and maybe some excitement.

688
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,280
- 这些对你来说不算什么 对吧？
- 很不错
{\fs11}- Doesn't seem much to you, does it?
- It's great.

689
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,530
这么跟你说吧
{\fs11}Tell you what.

690
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,780
我们为什么不一起做这些事情呢？
{\fs11}Why don't we do all those things together?

691
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,370
你不用工作吗？
{\fs11}Don't you have to work?

692
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,830
工作？不用 今天放假
{\fs11}Work? No. Today's going to be a holiday.

693
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,000
可你不会想要做一大堆愚蠢的事情的
{\fs11}But you don't want to do a lot of silly things.

694
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,170
我会不想吗？
{\fs11}Don't I?

695
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,420
第一件想做的事 去家路边咖啡馆 这就走吧
{\fs11}First wish, one sidewalk cafe. Coming right up.

要是学校里的人看到你新剪的头发他们会怎么说？
{\fs11}What will the people at school say when they see your new haircut?

698
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,770
他们会大吃一惊的
{\fs11}They'll have a fit.

699
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,650
要是他们知道我整晚都在你的房间里他们会说什么呢？
{\fs11}What would they say if they knew I'd spent the night in your room?

700
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:42,900
噢 我告诉你吧 你不能告诉你的朋友 我也不会告诉我的朋友
{\fs11}Well, I tell you what. You don't tell your folks, and I won't tell mine.

701
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,440
就这么说定了
{\fs11}It's a pact.

702
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,490
好了 你想喝什么？
{\fs11}Well, what would you like to drink?

703
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,280
香槟 谢谢
{\fs11}Champagne, please.

704
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,540
香槟？
{\fs11}Champagne?

705
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,380
给我来杯冰咖啡
{\fs11}And cold coffee for me.

706
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,420
你在那所学校里一定过着奢华的生活
{\fs11}Must be quite a life you have in that school.

707
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,800
午饭喝香槟
{\fs11}Champagne for lunch.

708
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,340
只有在特别的场合才喝
{\fs11}Only on special occasions.

709
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,640
比如说？
{\fs11}For instance?

710
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,010
最近一次是在我父亲的周年纪念日
{\fs11}The last time was my father's anniversary.

711
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,310
结婚纪念日？
{\fs11}Weding?

712
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:19,560
不是 纪念他从事工作40周年
{\fs11}No. It was the 40th anniversary of the day he got his job.

713
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,650
40年都在从事一份工作 你对他的工作知道多少？
{\fs11}Forty years on the job. What do you know about that?

714
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,150
他是干什么的？
{\fs11}What does he do?

715
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,530
嗯 最接近的说法应该叫公共关系吧
{\fs11}Well, mostly you might call it public relations.

716
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,030
噢 那工作挺辛苦的
{\fs11}Well, that's hard work.

717
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,740
- 是的 我不在意他的工作
- 那他呢？
{\fs11}- Yes, I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

718
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,990
我曾听到他抱怨自己的工作
{\fs11}I've heard him complain about it.

719
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,910
他为什么不辞职呢？
{\fs11}Why doesn't he quit?

720
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,460
噢 干那行的人几乎就不能辞职
{\fs11}Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit,

721
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,460
除非他们的健康状况真的恶化到无法继续工作
{\fs11}unless it's actually unhealthy for them to continue.

722
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,960
噢 那 祝他身体健康
{\fs11}Well, here's to his health, then.

723
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,300
知道吗 每个人都这么说
{\fs11}You know, that's what everybody says.

724
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,930
味道还好吗？
{\fs11}It's all right?

725
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,520
还好 谢谢
{\fs11}Yes, thank you.

726

{\fs11}I'm in the selling game.

728
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,520
真的吗？听起来很有意思
{\fs11}Really? How interesting.

729

{\fs11}Irving! Well, am I glad to see you!

734
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:31,250
高兴什么？你又忘了带钱包吗？
{\fs11}Why? Did you forget your wallet?

735
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,880
搬把椅子过来 艾文 跟我们坐一起
{\fs11}Pull up a chair, Irving. Sit down with us.

736
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,300
你不打算跟我介绍一下吗？

服务生？
{\fs11}Waiter?

747
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,290
这是个美国短语
{\fs11}It's an American term,

748
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:22,670
意思是说某个人非常的有魅力 迷人

768
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,140
你在哪儿找到的这个疯子？
{\fs11}Where did you find this loony?

769
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,270
没有说你 敬你一杯
{\fs11}You're okay. Here's to you.

770
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,820
致以我最美好的祝愿
{\fs11}Here's hoping for the best.

771
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,280
要不是因为这发型 我发誓...

{\fs11}I slipped? I almost hurt myself?

775
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,040
- 乔 我不是滑倒的！

{\fs11}- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain there.

776
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,500
别管我扭伤得怎样 乔
{\fs11}Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe.

777
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,420
我们最好到那边去把衣服弄干净

她真的就是...
{\fs11}She's really the...

789

{\fs11}We've got to entertain her, don't we?

798
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,760
乔 我们不能带着这么惹眼的公主在城里到处转悠
{\fs11}Joe, we can't go running around town with a hot princess.

799
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,600
你到底想不想做这笔交易了？
{\fs11}Do you want in on this deal or don't you?

{\fs11}Well, what's the verdict? Okay?

814
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,700
没什么感觉

815
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,950

{\fs11}Well, what shall we do next? Shall we make out a little schedule?

820
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,340
别说那个词 拜托
{\fs11}Not that word, please.

821
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,470
我说的不是工作...学校时间表
{\fs11}I didn't mean a work... School schedule.

822
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,220
我说的是娱乐时间表
{\fs11}I meant a fun schedule.

823
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,640
好的 我们走吧
{\fs11}Yes. Let's just go.

824
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,930
噢 你怎么样 艾文？你准备好了吗？
{\fs11}Well, how about you, Irving? Are you ready?

825
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,310
- 是的
- 那走吧
{\fs11}- Yeah.
- Let's go.

826
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:27,560
弗朗西斯卡！
{\fs11}Francesca!

827
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,980
- 这位是...
- 史密蒂
{\fs11}- This is...
- Smitty.

828
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,490
她可是位千金小姐 艾文 千金
{\fs11}She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

829
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,320
5,000 艾文
{\fs11}Five grand, Irving.

830
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,530
- 乔！
- 你这是要去哪儿？
{\fs11}- Joe!
- Where are you going now?

831
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,490
亲爱的 我要开始工作了 我晚上再给你电话
{\fs11}Honey, I gotta work. I'll call you tonight.

832
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,830
看看那些家伙！
{\fs11}Look at those men!

833
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,450
他们应该别那么引人注意的
{\fs11}They were supposed to be inconspicuous.

834
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,660
是你要求穿便装的
{\fs11}You asked for plain clothes.

835
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,450
嘿！抱歉
{\fs11}Hey! Excuse me.

836
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,930
嘿！停下！骑着VESPA回来！
{\fs11}Hey! Stop! Come back with your VESPA here!

837
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,700
- 让我来...
- 不 不 让我来 我可以开的
{\fs11}- Let me take this...
- No, no. Let it go. I can do it.

838
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,700
<font color=#FF7F00>[译者忽然觉得李刚他儿子有点儿冤 要是他爹就给他买个VESPA的话...]</font>

840
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,250
噢
{\fs11}Yeah.

841
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,620
从现在起我要改过自新了
{\fs11}I'm going straight from now on.

842
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,090
美国通讯社？他什么意思？
{\fs11}American News Service? What did he mean?

843
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,010
噢 知道吗 要是你说自己是新闻界的
{\fs11}Well, you know, you say you're with the press,

844
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,760
任何麻烦你都能躲过去的
{\fs11}you can get away with anything.

845
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,640
骑着<font color=#FF7F00>[VESPA]</font>摩托车去教堂结婚吧 了不起的家伙
{\fs11}Going to church to get married on a scooter, that's a hot one.

846
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,640
乔相当会说谎
{\fs11}Joe's a wonderful liar.

847
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,520
恭喜 恭喜
{\fs11}Congratulations. Congratulations.

848
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,290
你不用这么担心 我不会要你娶我的
{\fs11}You don't have to look so worried. I won't hold you to it.

849
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,160
非常感谢
{\fs11}Thank you very much.

850
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,750
你也没必要这么高兴吧！
{\fs11}You don't have to be too grateful!

851
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,330
好的 我没有
{\fs11}Okay, I won't.

852
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,550
我也很能说谎 对吧 布兰德利先生？
{\fs11}I'm a good liar, too, aren't I, Mr. Bradley?

853
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,420
是我认识的人里最棒的
{\fs11}The best I ever met.

854
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,180
非常感谢
{\fs11}Thank you very much.

855
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,840
我说...
{\fs11}Say...

856
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,140
跟我来吧
{\fs11}Come with me.

857
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,980
诚实之口
<font color=#FF7F00>[也译为真实之口 位于罗马科斯梅丁圣母堂]</font>
<font color=#FF7F00>[Ita：Bocca della Verità-Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin]</font>
{\fs11}The mouth of truth.

858
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:33,190
传说中要是你把手放在这里并说谎的话
{\fs11}The legend is that if you're given to lying and put your hand in there,

859
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,940
手就会被咬掉
<font color=#FF7F00>[这个传说自其17世纪出土后出现]</font>
{\fs11}it'll be bitten off.

860
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,780
这真可怕
{\fs11}What a horrid idea.

861
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,490
你试试看
{\fs11}Let's see you do it.

862
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,680
你试试看
{\fs11}Let's see you do it.

863
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,140
好吧
{\fs11}Sure.

864
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,700
你好
{\fs11}Hello.

865
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,790
你这个坏蛋！
{\fs11}You beast!

866
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,660
你根本就没事！你的手根本就没有受伤！
{\fs11}It was perfectly all right! You never hurt your hand!

867
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,170
抱歉 开个玩笑而已
{\fs11}I'm sorry. It's just a joke.

868
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,880
你的手根本就没有受伤
{\fs11}You never hurt your hand.

869
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,920
抱歉 你没事吧？
{\fs11}I'm sorry. You okay?

870
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,760
- 是的
- 那好 我们走吧
{\fs11}- Yes.
- All right. Let's go.

871
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,130
小心！
{\fs11}Look out!

872
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,130
<font color=#FF7F00>[译者趋同于这是古罗马的下水道井盖的说法]
[各位观众是不是觉得有些冷？]</font>

873
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,350
我去把车停在那个墙角
{\fs11}I'll park at the corner.

874
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,620
这些题字 是要表达什么意思？
{\fs11}What do they mean, all these inscriptions?

875
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,630
噢 每一个都代表着实现了一个愿望
{\fs11}Well, each one represents a wish fulfilled.

876
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:28,250
这始于大战期间一次空袭的时候
{\fs11}It all started during the war when there was an air raid right out here,

877
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,840
一个男人同自己的四个孩子被困在街上
{\fs11}a man with his four children was caught in the street.

878
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,590
他们跑到这堵墙边寻求庇护
{\fs11}They ran over against the wall right there for shelter

879
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,220
祈祷自己能够平安
{\fs11}and prayed for safety.

880
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,350
炸弹就掉在非常近的地方 可没有一个人受伤
{\fs11}Bombs fell very close, but no one was hurt.

881
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:43,520
后来 这个男人回到这里 挂上了第一个纪念牌
{\fs11}Later on, the man came back and he put up the first of these tablets.

882
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
从那时起 这里就成为了一个圣地
{\fs11}Since then, it's become a sort of a shrine.

883
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:48,440
人们到这里来 等到他们的愿望实现的时候
{\fs11}People come, and whenever their wishes are granted,

884
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,650
他们就会再挂上这样一个小瓷片
{\fs11}they put up another one of these little plaques.

885
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,070
很美的故事
{\fs11}Lovely story.

886
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,780
看看这些题字吧
{\fs11}Read some of the inscriptions.

887
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,920
要许愿吗？
{\fs11}Make a wish?

888
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,880
还是跟医生说吗？
{\fs11}Tell the doctor?

889
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,220
不管怎样 愿望能实现的机会都微乎其微
{\fs11}Anyway, the chances of it being granted are very slight.

890
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,310
噢 现在去哪儿呢？
{\fs11}Well, what now?

891
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,190
我知道一个好地方 可以在船上跳舞
{\fs11}I've heard of a wonderful place for dancing on a boat.

892
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,270
你指的是 圣安杰洛<font color=#FF7F00>[城堡]</font>边的驳船？
<font color=#FF7F00>[<i>哈德良陵墓</i> 现名<i>圣安杰洛城堡</i> 位于帕克 阿德里亚诺，罗马]

893
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,860
是的 我们今晚去不好吗？
{\fs11}Yes, couldn't we go there tonight?

894
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,110
- 为什么不呢？
- 只要是你想做的都行
{\fs11}- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

895
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,660
等到了午夜 我就会穿着我的水晶鞋乘上一辆南瓜车 离开的
{\fs11}And then at midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper.

896
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,490
那是童话故事的结局
{\fs11}And that'll be the end of the fairytale.

897
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,080
噢 我猜艾文现在得走了
{\fs11}Well, I guess Irving has to go now.

898
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,660
我吗？
{\fs11}I do?

899
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,830
是的 要知道 你还有单大业务要谈
{\fs11}Yes, you know, that big business development of yours

900
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,000
你不是得参加吗？
{\fs11}that you have to attend to?

901
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,380
噢 业务
{\fs11}Oh, the development.

902
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,170
没错 那可不能怠慢了
{\fs11}Yes, can't afford not to take care of that.

903
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,840
好吧 晚些时候再见 史密蒂
{\fs11}Yeah. I'll see you later, Smitty.

904
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,220
- 祝大业务谈判顺利
- 谢谢
{\fs11}- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

905
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,070

909
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,650
你好
{\fs11}Hello.

910
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,870
布兰德利先生 要是你不介意我这么说的话
{\fs11}Mr. Bradley, if you don't mind my saying so,

911
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,000
我觉得你是个
ringer<font color=#FF7F00>[按照布兰德利之前的胡诌 此处为有魅力的人]</font>
{\fs11}I think you are a ringer.

912
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,500
什么？
{\fs11}A what?

913
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,790
噢！
{\fs11}Oh!

914
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,540
非常感谢
{\fs11}Thanks very much.

915
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,920
你整天都陪着我做我想做的事
{\fs11}You've spent the whole day doing things I've always wanted to.

916
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,090
为什么？
<font color=#FF7F00>[公主一直都觉得你对她动了情]</font>
{\fs11}Why?

917
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,380
我不知道 这是应该的
{\fs11}I don't know. It seemed the thing to do.

918
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,890
我从不知道有这么好的人
{\fs11}I've never heard of anybody so kind.

919
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,850
举手之劳
{\fs11}It wasn't any trouble.

920
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,390
如此的慷慨无私
{\fs11}Or so completely unselfish.

921
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,320
我们去吧台喝一杯吧
{\fs11}Let's have a drink at the bar.

922
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,910
你来了！
{\fs11}There you are!

923
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,700
我找你很久了 我还以为也许你不会来了
{\fs11}I look for you a long time. I think maybe you not come.

924
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,830
剪掉...都剪掉！
{\fs11}Off... All off!

925
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,040
短发很好看 对吧？
{\fs11}It's nice without, isn't it?

926
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,250
酷
{\fs11}Cool.

927
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,750
非常 非常好
<font color=#FF7F00>[意大利人恶补英语就补出来个GOOD!]</font>
{\fs11}Very, very good.

930

{\fs11}Old friends?

931
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:06,130
是的 今天下午他给我剪的头发 他邀我今晚来这儿的
{\fs11}Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon. He invited me here tonight.

932
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,680
噢 你说你的名字是？
{\fs11}Well, what did you say the name was?

{\fs11}Me, too.

936

{\fs11}May I enjoy myself... The pleasure... Do you mind?

937
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,990
不 不介意 请便吧

谢谢
{\fs11}Thank you.

939
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,050
- 我有错过什么吗？
- 你来得正是时候 朋友
{\fs11}- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

940
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,220
和史密蒂跳舞的那人是谁？
{\fs11}Who's Smitty dancing with?

941
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,060
理发师
{\fs11}The barber.

942
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,020
今天下午给她理发 今晚还约了她
{\fs11}Cut her hair this afternoon. Made a date for tonight.

943
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,230
公主和理发师
{\fs11}The princess and the barber.

944
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,880
怎么回事？
{\fs11}What is it?

945
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,650
奥伽斯
{\fs11}August.

946
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,370
谢谢！
{\fs11}Thank you!

947
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,000
再见
{\fs11}Bye.

948
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,430
公主殿下
{\fs11}Your Highness.

949
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,440
慢慢跳到入口那边去
{\fs11}You'll dance quietly towards the entrance.

950
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,230
那里有辆车在等着
{\fs11}There is a car waiting.

951
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,310
- 不
- 公主殿下 请吧
{\fs11}- No.
- Your Highness, please.

952
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,860
你弄错了
{\fs11}You've made a mistake.

953
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,610
放开我 你不肯放手吗？
{\fs11}Let me go. Will you let me go?

954
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,030
布兰德利先生！放开我 你不放手吗？布兰德利先生！
{\fs11}Mr. Bradley! Let me go, will you? Mr. Bradley!

955
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,220
放手！
{\fs11}Let go!

956
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,600
你...
{\fs11}You...

957
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,060
再给他一下 史密蒂！
{\fs11}Hit him again, Smitty!

958
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,320
- 乔 这是我的车钥匙
- 警察来了 警察来了 快走
{\fs11}- Joe, here are my car keys.
- The police. The police. Come on.

959
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,620
快到桥那边去
{\fs11}The other side of the bridge.

960
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,620
<font color=#FF7F00>[无处不在的喵星人 哪怕只有个背影]</font>

961
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,060
没事吧？
{\fs11}All right?

962
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,220
还好 你呢？
{\fs11}Fine. How are you?

963
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:18,430
没事
{\fs11}Fine.

964
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,650
你知道吗 你刚才真的好厉害
{\fs11}Say, you know, you were great back there.

965
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,860
你也不差啊
{\fs11}You weren't so bad yourself.

966
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,720
我想我们最好还是乘艾文的车离开这里吧
{\fs11}I guess we'd better get Irving's car and get out of here.

967
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,120
这是自罗马广播的美国时段节目
{\fs11}This is The American Hour from Rome,

968
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,120
现在继续我们的音乐精选节目
{\fs11}continuing our program of musical selections.

969
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,690
衣服都弄脏了吗？
{\fs11}Everything ruined?

970
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,110
没有 很快就能干了
{\fs11}No. They'll be dry in a minute.

971
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,490
很合身
{\fs11}Suits you.

972
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,990
你可以一直穿我的衣服
{\fs11}You should always wear my clothes.

973
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,200
看起来是这样的
{\fs11}It seems I do.

974
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,750
我想喝点儿酒应该会感觉好些的
{\fs11}I thought a little wine might be good.

975
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,290
我可以做些东西吃吗？
{\fs11}Shall I cook something?

976
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,380
没有厨房 也没有可以做的东西 我都在外面吃
{\fs11}No kitchen. Nothing to cook. I always eat out.

977
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,050
你喜欢这样吗？
{\fs11}Do you like that?

978
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,550
生活并不总是如人意的
{\fs11}Life isn't always what one likes.

979
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,890
是吗？
{\fs11}Is it?

980
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,350
是的 不是的
{\fs11}No, it isn't.

981
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,110
- 累了吗？
- 有一点儿
{\fs11}- Tired?
- A little.

982
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:43,570
你过了相当难忘的一天
{\fs11}You've had quite a day.

983
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:45,110
美妙的一天
{\fs11}A wonderful day.

984
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,820
这是自罗马广播的美国时段节目
{\fs11}This is The American Hour from Rome,

985
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:50,410
现在用英语及意大利语播送一条特别新闻简讯
{\fs11}broadcasting a special news bulletin in English and Italian.

986
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:53,990
截至今晚 仍旧没有卧病在床的安公主的进一步消息
{\fs11}Tonight, there is no further word from the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome,

987
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:58,500
她在欧洲贸易推动之旅的最后一站 罗马 昨日突染疾病
{\fs11}where she was taken ill yesterday on the last leg of her European goodwill tour.

988
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,920
外界传闻说她的病情可能很严重
{\fs11}This has given rise to rumors that her condition may be serious,

989
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
这在她的国民之中造成了恐慌和焦虑的情绪
{\fs11}which is causing alarm and anxiety among the people in her country.

990
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,010
- 明天再听新闻吧
- 好的
{\fs11}- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

991
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,350
可以再给我倒点儿酒吗？
{\fs11}May I have a little more wine?

992
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,640
真抱歉我没能给我们做顿晚饭
{\fs11}I'm sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner.

993
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,310
你在学校学过怎么做饭吗？
{\fs11}Did you learn how in school?

994
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,190
我的厨艺很棒的
{\fs11}I'm a good cook.

995
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:26,860
我可以以此为生的
{\fs11}I could earn my living at it.

996
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,900
我还会针线 清洁房屋和熨衣服
{\fs11}I can sew, too, and clean a house and iron.

997
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,030
这些事情我都会
{\fs11}I learned to do all those things.

998
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:35,360
我只是没机会为谁做这些事罢了
{\fs11}I just haven't had the chance to do it for anyone.

999
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,370
噢 看来我该搬家了
{\fs11}Well, it looks like I'll have to move

1000
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,710
我得给自己找间带厨房的屋子了
{\fs11}and get myself a place with a kitchen.

1001
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,760
是的
{\fs11}Yes.

1002
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,860
我该走了 现在
{\fs11}I shall have to go now.

1003
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,130
安雅...
{\fs11}Anya...

1004
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,300
有些事我想告诉你
{\fs11}There's something that I want to tell you.

1005
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,720
别说了
{\fs11}No, please.

1006
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,270
什么都别说
{\fs11}Nothing.

1007
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,370
我必须换上衣服离开了
{\fs11}I must go and get dressed.

1008
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:51,200
请在下一个转角处停车
{\fs11}Stop at the next corner, please.

1009
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,370
好的
{\fs11}Okay.

1010
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,720
是这里吗？
{\fs11}Here?

1011
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,300
是的
{\fs11}Yes.

1012
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,350
我得离开你了 现在
{\fs11}I have to leave you now.

1013
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,900
我会走到那个转角然后转过去
{\fs11}I'm going to that corner there and turn.

1014
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,530
你必须留在车里然后离开
{\fs11}You must stay in the car and drive away.

1015
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:43,790
答应我过了转角就不要再看我
{\fs11}Promise not to watch me go beyond the corner.

1016
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:48,080
只管开车离开 别管我
{\fs11}Just drive away and leave me,

1017
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,710
就像我离开你那样
{\fs11}as I leave you.

1018
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,840
好吧
{\fs11}All right.

1019
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,930
我不知道该如何道别
{\fs11}I don't know how to say good-bye.

1020
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,440
我不知道该说什么
{\fs11}I can't think of any words.

1021
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,360
那就别说了
{\fs11}Don't try.

1022
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:14,010
公主殿下 24个小时 不可能什么都没发生
{\fs11}Your Royal Highness, 24 hours, they can't all be blank.

1023
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,300
当然不是
{\fs11}They are not.

1024
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,230
可我该怎么同国王和王后解释呢？
{\fs11}But what explanation am I to offer Their Majesties?

1025
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:26,350
我之前不舒服 现在我好多了
{\fs11}I was indisposed. I am better.

1026
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:33,990
殿下 您必须理解我得履行自己的职责
{\fs11}Ma'am, you must appreciate that I have my duty to perform,

1027
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:37,280
正如公主殿下也有她自己的职责
{\fs11}just as Your Royal Highness has her duty.

1028
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,990
阁下 我相信您会发现今后没必要
{\fs11}Your Excellency, I trust you will not find it necessary

1029
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,950
再说那样的话了
{\fs11}to use that word again.

1030
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:49,210
要是我完全意识不到自己对家人和国民还负有责任的话
{\fs11}Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country,

1031
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,830
今晚我就不会回来了
{\fs11}I would not have come back tonight,

1032
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,680
或者 应该说是 永远不会回来
{\fs11}or, indeed, ever again.

1033
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:12,850
好了 我知道我们今天的时间表排得相当满
{\fs11}And now, since I understand we have a very full schedule today,

1034
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,110
你们都可以退下了
{\fs11}you have my permission to withdraw.

1035
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,500
不用端牛奶还有饼干了
{\fs11}No milk and crackers.

1036
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,430
我没有什么吩咐了 谢谢 伯爵夫人
{\fs11}That will be all, thank you, Countess.

1037
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,150
真的吗？你真的办到了吗？
{\fs11}Is it true? Did you really get it?

1038
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:50,490
办到什么？
{\fs11}Did I get what?

1039
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,570
公主的料啊 独家采访 你办到了吗？
{\fs11}The princess story. The exclusive. Did you get it?

1040
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,820
不 没有 我没有办到
{\fs11}No, no, I didn't get it.

1041
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,700
什么？这不可能
{\fs11}What? But that's impossible.

1042
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,160
要喝杯咖啡或者别的吗？
{\fs11}Have a cup of coffee or something?

1043
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,490
- 乔 你可不能瞒着我
- 谁要瞒着你了？
{\fs11}- Joe, you can't hold out on me.
- Who's holding out on you?

1044
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,660
- 是你
- 你在胡说些什么？
{\fs11}- You are.
- What are you talking about?

1045
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,000
我都知道
{\fs11}I know too much.

1046
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,250
你先是走进我的办公室
{\fs11}First you come into my office

1047
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:06,170
然后说要对公主做个独家采访
{\fs11}and ask about an exclusive on the princess.

1048
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,710
接着 你就跑出去了
{\fs11}Next, you disappear.

1049
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:10,210
之后我从自己在大使馆的关系那里听说
{\fs11}Then I get the rumor from my contact at the embassy

1050
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,340
公主没有生病而是自己跑到城里来了
{\fs11}that the princess isn't sick at all and she's out on the town.

1051
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,800
你还算得上是新闻工作者吗？
{\fs11}What kind of a newspaperman are you?

1052
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,130
所有传到你耳朵里的毫无根据的传言你也信吗？
{\fs11}You believe every two-bit rumor that comes your way?

1053
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,720
嗯 还有很多其他的传闻
{\fs11}Yeah, and a lot of other rumors

1054
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,100
像是河边驳船上的舞会
{\fs11}about a shindig on a barge down by the river

1055
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:25,230
还有来自某国的8名秘密情务人员被捕
{\fs11}and the arrest of eight Secret Service men from a country which shall be nameless.

1056
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:28,350
之后就传出公主奇迹般康复的新闻
{\fs11}And then comes the news of the lady's miraculous recovery.

1057
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,980
现在都满天飞了
{\fs11}It all ads up.

1058
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,520
别给我抬杠 好抬高你手上料的价钱
{\fs11}And don't think by playing hard to get you'll raise the price of that story.

1059
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,110
交易就是交易
{\fs11}A deal's a deal.

1060
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:38,360
好了 快说吧 快说吧 你弄的料呢？
{\fs11}Now, come on, come on, where is that story?

1061
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,410
我手上没有什么料
{\fs11}I have no story.

1062
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,580
- 那之前你怎么会想到要...
- 乔！
{\fs11}- Then what was the idea of...
- Joe!

1063
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:49,910
- 伙计 等你们看到这些

你好 亨尼西先生 您来得正是时候
{\fs11}Hiya, Mr. Hennessy. You got here at the right time.

1065
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,750
- 艾文...
- 等你看了...
{\fs11}- Irving...
- Wait till you get a look...

1066
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:56,920
这是什么意思？
{\fs11}What's the idea?

1067
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,670
你跑这里来把东西在我的房间里洒得到处都是想干什么？
{\fs11}What do you mean charging in here and spilling things all over my place?

1068
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,800
谁洒得到处都是了？
{\fs11}Who's spilling?

1069
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,720
就是你 我之前就这样跟你说过一次了
{\fs11}You did. I spoke to you about that once before.

1070
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,550
你还记得吗？
{\fs11}Don't you remember?

1071
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:05,600
乔 看看我的裤子
{\fs11}Joe, look at my pants.

1072
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,720
噢 你最好进去吧裤子弄干 艾文
{\fs11}Yeah, you'd better come in here and dry them off, Irving.

1073
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,390
别胡说了
{\fs11}Nuts to that.

1074
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,480
- 嘿 他有没有跟你说起过史密蒂？
- 艾文...
{\fs11}- Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?
- Irving...

1075
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,690
史密蒂？
{\fs11}Smitty?

1076
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,890
- 亨尼西先生...
- 艾文...
{\fs11}- Mr. Hennessy...
- Irving...

1077
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,350
等到...
{\fs11}Wait till...

1078
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,730
你又来了 艾文
{\fs11}There you go again, Irving.

1079
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:21,690
乔
{\fs11}Joe.

1080
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,820
- 好吧 有什么话待会儿再说
- 听着...
{\fs11}- All right, save that till later.
- Listen...

1081
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,570
不管怎样 你来早了点儿 你干嘛不先回家去刮个胡子呢？
{\fs11}You're here early, anyway. Why don't you go home and shave?

1082
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,620
刮胡子？
{\fs11}Shave?

1083
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,330
是的 要不就在我同亨尼西先生谈完之前保持安静
{\fs11}Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.

1084
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,960
嘿 这到底是怎么回事？
{\fs11}Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1085
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,080
你们两个在说什么？谁是史密蒂？
{\fs11}What are you two guys up to? Who's Smitty?

1086
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,290
他是我们认识的一个人 你没必要在意他
{\fs11}He's a guy that we met. You wouldn't care for him.

1087
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,500
要是我想看看呢？
{\fs11}What am I supposed to look at?

1088
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:44,340
不用了 只不过是些艾文的美女照 你不会喜欢的
{\fs11}No, just a couple of Irving's dames. You wouldn't like them.

1089
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,970
也许你会喜欢的
{\fs11}Maybe you would.

1090
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:49,260
别岔开话题 昨天你走进我办公室的时候...
{\fs11}Don't change the subject. When you came back into my office yesterday...

1091
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,390
是的 我知道 昨天下午 我以为自己掌握了个好料
{\fs11}Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon, I thought I had a good lead,

1092
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:52,930
可我弄错了
{\fs11}but I was wrong.

1093
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,980
事情就是这样 什么料都没有
{\fs11}That's all there is to it. There is no story.

1094
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,850
好吧
{\fs11}Okay.

1095
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,690
她今天举行记者招待会 同样的时间 同样的地点
{\fs11}She's holding the press interview today. Same time, same place.

1096
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,280
也许这次你能弄到料
{\fs11}Maybe that's one story you can get.

1097
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:09,950
你还欠我500美元！
{\fs11}And you owe me 500 bucks!

1098
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:11,990
从我的薪水里扣吧 每周50美元
{\fs11}Take it out of my salary, 50 bucks a week.

1099
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,820
别以为我不会
{\fs11}Don't think I won't.

1100
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,790
嘿 怎么了？
{\fs11}Hey, what gives?

1101
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:20,460
有人给我们出更高的价吗？
{\fs11}Have we had a better offer?

1102
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:24,790
艾文 我不知道该怎么跟你说 可是...
{\fs11}Irving, I don't know just how to tell you this, but...

1103
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,170
我先坐下来再说吧
{\fs11}Wait till I sit down.

1104
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:35,300
好了 关于这次的料还有这些照片
{\fs11}Well, in regard to the story that goes with these,

1105
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,930
没有什么料
{\fs11}there is no story.

1106
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:42,140
为什么没有？
{\fs11}Why not?

1107
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,480
我是说 我之前没有考虑清楚
{\fs11}I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1108
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:02,950
嘿 照片洗出来相当不错 你想看看吗？
{\fs11}Hey, the pictures came out pretty well. You want to have a look at them?

1109
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,470
怎么样 从这么小的底片洗出来的？
{\fs11}How about a blowup from a negative that size?

1110
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:22,680
- 这是她的第一支烟
- 噢 是啊 在Rocca咖啡馆
{\fs11}- That's her first cigarette.
- Oh, yeah. At Rocca's.

1111
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,760
嘿 诚实之口
{\fs11}Hey, the mouth of truth.

1112
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,850
噢 你想知道我给这张想的标题是什么吗？
{\fs11}Oh, you want to know the caption I had in mind there?

1113
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:30,600
“闯入<font color=#FF7F00>[公主生活]</font>的理发师”
{\fs11}"Barber cuts in."

1114
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,900
噢 这张我觉得应该排在最醒目的位置
{\fs11}Well, here's the one I figured would be the key shot for the layout.

1115
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:38,190
“愿望成真之墙”
{\fs11}"The wall where wishes come true."

1116
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,820
乔 这主意不错
{\fs11}Joe, that's good.

1117
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,200
先是那些照片 然后就是愿望墙的照片
{\fs11}Lead off with that, then follow up with the wishes.

1118
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:45,910
这是我从档案中找出来的
{\fs11}I dug that up out of the file.

1119
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,990
“公主检阅警察”
{\fs11}"Princess inspects police."

1122
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,040
怎么样？
{\fs11}How about it?

1123
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,090
- 乔 我有个好东西要给你
- 很好...
{\fs11}- Joe, I got a topper for you.
- Pretty good...

1124
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:00,670

{\fs11}- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1126
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,010
这够冲击吧 乔？
{\fs11}Is that a shot, Joe?

1127
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,220

{\fs11}I get it! That's... Joe, you got...

1131
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,730
她就是供人评论的对象 乔
{\fs11}She's fair game, Joe.

1132
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,030
对公主怎么报导都可以
{\fs11}It's always open season on princesses.

1133
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,660
你一定是疯了
{\fs11}You must be out of your mind.

好了 听着 如果你打算卖掉这些照片的话我也阻止不了你
{\fs11}Well, look, I can't prevent you from selling the pictures if you want to.

1136
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:39,580
- 你可以拿它们卖个好价钱
- 没错！
{\fs11}- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah!

1137
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,970
你这是要去记者招待会吗？
{\fs11}You going to the interview?

1138
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,390
你去吗？
{\fs11}Are you going?

1139
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:53,010
