00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,720
Paramount News brings you a special coverage

2
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,550
of Princess Ann's visit to London,

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,060
the first stop on her much-publicized goodwill tour of European capitals.

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,560
She gets a royal welcome from the British,

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,770
as thousands cheer the gracious young member

6
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,690
of one of Europe's oldest ruling families.

7
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,440
After three days of continuous activity and a visit to Buckingham Palace,

8
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,400
Ann flew to Amsterdam,

9
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,820
where Her Royal Highness dedicated the new International Aid Building

10
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,950
and christened an ocean liner,

11
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,490
then went to Paris,

12
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,580
where she attended many official functions

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,120
designed to cement trade relations

14
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,580
between her country and the Western European nations.

15
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,000
And so, to Rome, the Eternal City,

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,960
where the princess' visit was marked by a spectacular military parade

17
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,260
highlighted by the band of the crack Bersaglieri regiment.

18
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,810
The smiling young princess showed no sign of the strain

19
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,390
of the week's continuous public appearances,

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
and, at her country's embassy that evening,

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,650
a formal reception and ball in her honor

22
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,820
was given by her country's ambassador to Italy.

23
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,880
Her Royal Highness.

24
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,270
His Excellency, the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Altomonte.

25
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,780
Sir Hugo Macy de Farmington.

26
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,610
- Good evening, Sir Hugo.
- Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

27
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,780
His Highness the Maharajah of Khanipur

28
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,580
and the Rajkumari.

29
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,620
I'm so glad that you could come.

30
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

31
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,040
Friherre Erick af Massinsjarna Bergenskiold.

32
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,630
Prince Istvan Barlossy Nagyavaros.

33
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,630
How do you do?

34
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,020
Lhre Hoheit der Furst und die Fursten von und zu Luchtenstichenholz.

35
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Sir Hari Singh and Kmark Singh.

36
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,360
The Count and Countess Von Marstrand.

37
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,610
Good evening, Countess.

38
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,660
Good evening.

39
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,170
Señor e Señora Joao de Camoes.

40
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,380
Good evening.

41
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,260
Hassan El Din Pasha.

42
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,880
How do you do?

43
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,940
I hate this nightgown.

44
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,700
I hate all my nightgowns, and I hate all my underwear, too.

45
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,030
My dear, you have lovely things.

46
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,410
But I'm not two hundred years old.

47
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,950
Why can't I sleep in pajamas?

48
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
Pajamas!

49
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,000
Just the top part.

50
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,880
Did you know there are people

51
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
who sleep with absolutely nothing on at all?

52
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,880
I rejoice to say that I did not.

53
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,800
Listen.

54
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,890
Ann, your slippers.

55
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,190
Please put on your slippers and come away from the window.

56
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,120
Your milk and crackers.

57
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,620
Everything we do is so wholesome.

58
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,290
They'll help you to sleep.

59
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,210
I'm too tired to sleep. I shan't sleep a wink.

60
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,340
Now, my dear, if you don't mind, tomorrow's schedule, or "schedule,"

61
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,920
whichever you prefer. Both are correct.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,670
8:30, breakfast here with the embassy staff.

63
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,550
9:00, we leave for the Polinari automotive works,

64
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,850
where you'll be presented with a small car.

65
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,010
Thank you.

66
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,350
Which you will not accept.

67
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,470
No, thank you.

68
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,850
10:35, inspection of food and agricultural organization,

69
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,560
will present you with an olive tree.

70
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,850
No, thank you.

71
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,860
Which you will accept.

72
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,900
Thank you.

73
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,820
10:55, the New Foundling Home for Orphans.

74
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,950
You will preside over the laying of the cornerstone.

75
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,320
Same speech as last Monday.

76
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,660
Trade relations.

77
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,830
Yes.

78
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,410
For the orphans?

79
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,960
No, no, no, the other one.

80
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,460
Youth and progress.

81
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,870
Precisely.

82
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,960
11:45, back here to rest. No, that's wrong.

83
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,710
11:45, conference here with the press.

84
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,260
Sweetness and decency.

85
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,220
1:00 sharp, lunch with the Foreign Ministry.

86
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,890
You will wear your white lace and carry a bouquet of

87
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,390
- very small pink roses.
- Very small pink roses.

88
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,890
3:05, presentation of a plaque.

89
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Thank you.

90
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,730
4:10, review Special Guard of Carabinieri...

91
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,860
No, thank you.

92
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,270
- 4:45, back here to change...
- How do you do? Charmed.

93
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,230
...into your uniform to meet the...
- So happy...

94
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Stop!

95
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,570
- Good heavens!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

96
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,070
It's all right, dear. It didn't spill.

97
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
I don't care if it spilled or not.

98
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't care if I drowned in it!

99
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,660
My dear, you're ill.

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,830
I'll send for Dr. Bonnachoven.

101
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,340
I don't want Dr. Bonnachoven! Please let me die in peace.

102
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
You're not dying.

103
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,800
Leave me!

104
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,630
- Leave me!
- It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

105
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
I don't want to!

106
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,390
Your Highness!

107
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll get Dr. Bonnachoven.

108
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,100
It's no use.

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,100
I'll be dead before he gets here.

110
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,150
She's asleep.

111
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
She was in hysterics three minutes ago, Doctor.

112
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,410
Are you asleep, ma'am?

113
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,540
No!

114
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,420
I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness a moment.

115
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
I'm very ashamed, Dr. Bonnachoven.

116
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,170
Sudenly, I was crying.

117
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,220
To cry, a perfectly normal thing to do.

118
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,390
It's most important she be calm and relaxed

119
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,930
for the press conference, Doctor.

120
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,810
Don't worry, Doctor.

121
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,640
I'll be calm and relaxed.

122
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,810
I'll bow, and I'll smile.

123
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,390
I'll improve trade relations, and...

124
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,690
There she goes again. Give her something, Doctor, please.

125
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,400
Uncover her arm, please.

126
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,610
What's that?

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,160
Sleep and calm.

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
This will relax you and make Your Highness feel a little happy.

129
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,490
It's a new drug, quite harmless.

130
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,500
There.

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,130
I don't feel any different.

132
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,510
You will. It may take a little time to take hold.

133
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,880
Just, now, lie back.

134
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,550
Can I keep just one light on?

135
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,010
Of course.

136
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,970
Best thing I know

137
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,850
is to do exactly what you wish for a while.

138
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,350
Thank you, Doctor.

139
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,070
The General! Doctor, quick!

140
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,860
I'm perfectly all right.

141
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,870
Good night, ma'am.

142
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,200
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night, Doctor.

143
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,770
Bet 500.

144
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,310
500. How many?

145
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,060
One.

146
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,020
I'll take one.

147
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,400
Three.

148
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,940
Foolish boy.

149
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,780
Two for papa.

150
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,870
500 more.

151
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,580
Without looking.

152
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,920
500, and I'll raise you 1,000.

153
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,470
Two pairs.

154
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,970
I got three shy little sevens.

155
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,770
A nervous straight. Come home, you fools.

156
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,020
Look at that. 6,500.

157
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,350
Not bad. That's 10 bucks.

158
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,110
One more round,

159
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,860
and I'm going to throw you gents right out in the snow.

160
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,240
Say, what is this?

161
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,110
I got to get up early.

162
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,570
Date with Her Royal Highness,

163
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,070
who will graciously pose for some pictures.

164
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,410
What do you mean, early? My personal invitation says 11:45.

165
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Couldn't be anything to do with the fact that you're ahead?

166
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,290
It could.

167
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,040
It works out fine for me. This is my last 5,000,

168
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,760
and you hyenas are not gonna get it. Thanks a lot, Irving.

169
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,670
Yeah, see you at Annie's little party in the morning.

170
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,880
- Ciao, Joe.
- Yeah, ciao.

171
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,010
Good night, Joe.

172
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,800
All right, a little seven-card stud.

173
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,850
Okay with me.

174
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,820
So happy.

175
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,530
How are you this evening?

176
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,210
Hey, hey, hey.

177
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,750
Hey, wake up.

178
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,040
Thank you very much. Delighted.

179
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,420
Wake up.

180
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,050
No, thank you.

181
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,840
Charmed.

182
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,880
Charmed, too.

183
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,100
You may sit down.

184
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,310
I think you'd better sit up.

185
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,770
You're much too young to get picked up by the police.

186
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,400
- Police?
- Yep. Police.

187
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,280
2:15 and back here to change. 2:45...

188
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,910
You know, people who can't handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

189
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,290
"If I were dead and buried and I heard your voice

190
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,750
"beneath the sod my heart of dust would still rejoice."

191
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,500
Do you know that poem?

192
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,010
What do you know?

193
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,300
You're well-read, well-dressed,

194
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,850
snoozing away in a public street.

195
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,980
Would you care to make a statement?

196
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,600
What the world needs is a return to sweetness and decency

197
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,230
in the souls of its young men and...

198
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,410
Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more, but...

199
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,170
Get yourself some coffee. You'll be all right.

200
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,360
Look, you take the cab.

201
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,120
Come on, climb in the cab and go home.

202
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,040
- So happy.
- You got any money?

203
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,580
Never carry money.

204
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,420
That's a bad habit.

205
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,050
All right. I'll drop you off. Come on.

206
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,760
It's a taxi!

207
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,180
Well, it's not the Super Chief.

208
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,140
Where are we going?

209
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,890
Where do you live?

210
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,520
Colosseum.

211
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,150
Now, come on. You're not that drunk.

212
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,360
You're so smart. I'm not drunk at all.

213
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,820
I'm just being very happy.

214
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,360
There, now, don't go to sleep again. Come on.

215
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,330
Where are we going?

216
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,830
- Okay.
- Look, now, where do you want to go?

217
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,790
Where shall I take you?

218
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,590
Where do you live?

219
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,760
Come on. Come on. Where do you live?

220
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,510
Come on! Where do you live?

221
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,510
Colosseum.

222
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,060
She lives in the Colosseum.

223
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,640
Is wrong adress.

224
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,940
Now, look, signore, for me, it is very late night.

225
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,820
Wife. I have three bambino, three bambino.

226
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,570
You know bambino?

227
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,620
My taxi go home. I go home, too. Together.

228
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,620
Via Margutta 51.

229
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,740
Via Margutta 51.

230
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,050
Here is Via Margutta 51.

231
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,720
I am very happy.

232
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,760
1,000 lira.

233
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,150
One, two, three, four mille.

234
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,280
Okay.

235
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,070
For me?

236
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,990
Okay, okay. Now, look.

237
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,040
- Take a little bit of that...
- Yeah?

238
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,790
Take her wherever she wants to go.

239
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,500
Good night.

240
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,300
- No, no, no, no.
- All right, look.

241
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,180
As soon as she wakes up, see,

242
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,220
she'll tell you where she wants to go, okay?

243
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,640
My taxi is not for sleep.

244
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,230
My taxi. No sleep. Understand? You understand?

245
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,110
Look, pal. This is not my problem, see?

246
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,320
I never see her before. Okay.

247
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,110
Is not your problem. Is not my problem.

248
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,910
What you want? You don't want girl, yeah?

249
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,910
Me don't want girl.

250
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,450
Police! Maybe she want girl.

251
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, okay, okay.

252
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,920
So happy... So happy...

253
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,020
I ought to have my head examined.

254
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,570
Is this the elevator?

255
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,410
It's my room.

256
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,790
I'm terribly sorry to mention it, but the dizziness is getting worse.

257
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,000
Can I sleep here?

258
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,710
That's the general idea.

259
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,590
Can I have a silk nightgown with rosebuds on it?

260
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm afraid you'll have to rough it tonight, in these.

261
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,970
Pajamas!

262
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,480
Sorry, honey, but I haven't worn a nightgown in years.

263
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,480
Will you help me get undressed, please?

264
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,440
Okay.

265
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,540
There you are. You can handle the rest.

266
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,800
May I have some?

267
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,180
No.

268
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,350
Now, look...

269
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,350
This is very unusual.

270
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,690
I've never been alone with a man before,

271
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,690
even with my dress on.

272
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,990
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

273
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,780
I don't seem to mind.

274
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,160
Do you?

275
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,330
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

276
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
You'd better get to sleep.

277
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,750
No. On this one.

278
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,050
So terribly nice.

279
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,140
These are pajamas. They're to sleep in.

280
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,550
You're to climb into them. You understand?

281
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Thank you.

282
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,560
And you do your sleeping on the couch, see, not on the bed.

283
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,060
Not on the chair, on the couch. Is that clear?

284
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,850
Do you know my favorite poem?

285
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,730
You've already recited that for me.

286
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,240
"Arethusa arose From her couch of snows

287
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,570
"In the Acroceraunian mountains."

288
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,700
- Keats.
- Shelley.

289
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,290
You just keep your mind off the poetry and on the pajamas.

290
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,370
Everything'll be all right, see?

291
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,790
- It's Keats.
- Now, I'll be...

292
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,920
It's Shelley. I'll be back in about 10 minutes.

293
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,210
Keats.

294
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,340
You have my permission to withdraw.

295
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,260
Thank you very much.

296
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,600
- Well?
- No trace, Your Excellency.

297
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,940
Have you searched the grounds?

298
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,190
Every inch, sir, from the attics to the cellar.

299
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,990
I must put you on your honor not to speak of this to anyone.

300
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,410
I must remind you that the princess is the direct heir to the throne.

301
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,080
This must be classified as top crisis secret.

302
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,450
- Have I your pledge?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,870
Very well.

304
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,960
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

305
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,100
Oh.

306
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,040
So happy.

307
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,450
The pleasure's mine.

308
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,580
Screwball.

309
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,710
Holy smoke! The princess interview.

310
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,970
11:45.

311
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,930
Hi, Joe.

312
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,760
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

313
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,230
Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you.

314
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,820
Thanks a lot, hon.

315
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,690
Come in!

316
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,450
You've been looking for me?

317
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,830
Just coming to work?

318
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,200
Who, me?

319
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,830
We start our days at 8:30 in this office.

320
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,960
We pick up our assignments...

321
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,170
I picked mine up last night.

322
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,050
- What assignment was that?
- The princess. 11:45.

323
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,630
You've already been to the interview?

324
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,590
Sure. I just got back.

325
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,770
- Well, well, well, all my apologies.
- It's all right.

326
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,770
- This is very interesting.
- No, just routine.

327
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,310
Tell me, tell me, did she answer all the questions on the list?

328
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,940
Well, of course she did. I've got them right here somewhere.

329
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,860
Don't disturb yourself. I have a copy here.

330
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,530
How did Her Highness react to the idea of a European federation?

331
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,530
She thought it was just fine.

332
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,200
She did?

333
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,500
Well, she thought that there'd be two effects.

334
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Two?

335
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,580
The direct and the indirect.

336
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,170
Remarkable.

337
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,670
Naturally, she thought that the indirect would not be as direct as the direct.

338
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,260
- That is, not right away.
- No, no, no, no.

339
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,050
Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

340
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,730
Well, well, well, that was a shrewd observation.

341
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,060
They fool you, you know, these royal kids.

342
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
They've got a lot more on the ball than we suspect.

343
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,110
How did she feel about the future friendship of nations?

344
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,950
Youth.

345
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,030
She felt that the youth of the world

346
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,450
must lead the way to a better world.

347
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,920
Original.

348
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,670
By the way, what was she wearing?

349
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,710
You mean, what did she have on?

350
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,130
That's usually what it means.

351
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
What's the matter? Is it a little warm in here for you?

352
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,970
No, no. I just hurried over here, that's all.

353
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,760
Naturally, with a story of these dimensions.

354
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,180
Did you say she was wearing gray?

355
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,520
No, I didn't say that.

356
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,060
Well, she usually wears gray.

357
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,400
Well, it was a kind of a gray.

358
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,530
I think I know the dress you mean. It has a gold collar.

359
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,070
That's the one. That's the one, yeah.

360
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,320
I didn't know exactly how to describe it, but that's...

361
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,910
I think you described it very well,

362
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,240
in view of the fact that Her Highness

363
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,910
was taken violently ill at 3:00 this morning,

364
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,870
put to bed with a high fever,

365
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,710
and has had all her appointments for today canceled in toto!

366
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
In toto?

367
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,800
Yes, Mr. Bradley, in toto.

368
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,430
It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

369
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,100
In view of the fact that you just left her, of course.

370
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,760
But here it is, Mr. Bradley,

371
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,310
all over the front page of every newspaper in Rome.

372
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,390
All right, all right, I overslept. It can happen to anybody.

373
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,980
If you only got up early enough to read a morning paper,

374
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,020
you might discover little news events,

375
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,190
little items of general interest

376
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,360
that might prevent someone in the future from getting immersed

377
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,320
in such a gold-plated, triple-decked, star-spangled lie

378
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,120
as you have just told me.

379
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,490
If I were you, I would try some other line of business,

380
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
like mattress testing.

381
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,080
Is this the princess?

382
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,500
Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

383
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,590
It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour, or Madam Chiang Kai-Shek.

384
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,670
Take a good look at her.

385
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,260
You might be interviewing her again someday.

386
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,670
Am I fired?

387
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,550
No, you're not fired.

388
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,350
When I want to fire you, you won't have to ask.

389
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,470
You'll know you're fired!

390
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,520
The man's mad.

391
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,380
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

392
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,880
Now, listen carefully. I want you to hurry up to my place

393
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,970
and see if there's somebody there asleep.

394
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,430
Say, Mr. Joe, I look.

395
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
You wait.

396
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Mr. Joe?

397
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,240
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,170
Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

399
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,710
Yes, Mr. Joe?

400
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,250
A gun?

401
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
No!

402
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,800
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything,

403
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,550
but nobody goes in and nobody goes out.

404
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,930
Okay.

405
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,690
You still here?

406
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,240
How much would a real interview with this dame be worth?

407
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,910
Are you referring to Her Highness?

408
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,410
I'm not referring to Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour or...

409
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,450
How much?

410
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
What do you care? You got about as much chance as...

411
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,080
I know, but if I did, how much would it be worth?

412
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
Just a plain talk on world conditions might be worth 250.

413
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,300
Her views on clothes, of course, would be worth a lot more, maybe 1,000.

414
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

415
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,390
I'm talking about her views on everything.

416
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,060
The private and secret longings of a princess.

417
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,560
Her innermost thoughts,

418
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,940
as revealed to your Rome correspondent

419
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,730
in a private, personal, exclusive interview.

420
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,860
Can't use it, huh?

421
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,620
I didn't think you'd like it.

422
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,000
Come here.

423
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,920
Love angle, too, I suppose?

424
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,630
Practically all love angle.

425
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,670
With pictures.

426
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,340
Could be. How much?

427
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,590
That particular story will be worth five grand to any news service.

428
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,680
But tell me, Mr. Bradley, if you are sober,

429
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,890
just how you are going to obtain this fantastic interview.

430
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,480
I plan to enter her sickroom disguised as a thermometer.

431
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,940
You said five grand? I want you to shake on that.

432
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,780
And you realize, of course, Her Highness is in bed today

433
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,820
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

434
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Yep.

435
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,950
Now, I'd like to make a little side bet with you.

436
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,870
500 says you don't come up with the story.

437
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,330
What are you looking at that for?

438
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I just want to see what time it is.

439
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,290
- Huh?
- What day it is.

440
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,670
It's a deal!

441
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,800
Now I'd like you to shake.

442
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,600
Let's see, you're into me for about 500 now.

443
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,810
When you lose this bet, you'll owe me 1,000.

444
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,520
Why, you poor sucker, I'll practically own you.

445
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,100
You have practically owned me for a couple of years now.

446
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,480
But that's all over.

447
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,810
I'm going to win that money,

448
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,650
and with it, I'm gonna buy me a one-way ticket back to New York.

449
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,240
Go on, go on, I love to hear you whine.

450
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,450
And when I'm back in a real newsroom, I'll enjoy thinking about you,

451
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,530
sitting here with an empty leash in your hands

452
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,080
and nobody to twitch for you.

453
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,290
So long, pigeon!

454
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,270
Hey, Joe. What you know?

455
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,440
Is everything okay, Giovanni?

456
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,900
Nobody she's come. Nobody she's go.

457
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,990
Absolutely nobody.

458
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,870
Swell. Thanks a lot.

459
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,000
Giovanni...

460
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,120
How would you like to make some money?

461
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,210
- Money?
- Yeah.

462
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,460
That's the stuff. Now, look, I've got a sure thing.

463
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,340
Double your money back in two days.

464
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,590
Double my money?

465
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,260
Yeah, well, I need a little investment capital

466
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,390
to swing the deal.

467
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,390
Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash...

468
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,520
You owing me two months' rent,

469
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,110
and you want me to lend you money?

470
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,650
- Yeah.
- No.

471
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,990
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

472
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,590
Your Highness?

473
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,100
Your Royal Highness?

474
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,100
Yes, what is it?

475
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,150
Dear Dr. Bonnachoven...

476
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:40,290
Sure, yes, well, you're fine. Much better. Is there anything you want?

477
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,830
So many things.

478
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,580
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.
- So...

479
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,000
Tell the good doctor everything.

480
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,670
I dreamt, and I dreamt.

481
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,420
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

482
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,810
I dreamt I was asleep in the street, and a young man came.

483
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,270
He was tall and strong, and he was so mean to me.

484
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,570
He was?

485
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,740
It was wonderful.

486
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,690
Good morning.

487
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,190
Where's Dr. Bonnachoven?

488
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,570
I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.

489
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,570
Wasn't I talking to him just now?

490
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,030
Afraid not.

491
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,080
Have I had an accident?

492
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,040
No.

493
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,250
Quite safe for me to sit up?

494
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,130
Perfect.

495
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,310
Thank you.

496
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,780
Are these yours?

497
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,950
Did you lose something?

498
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:57,870
No.

499
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,710
Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am?

500
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,920
Well, this is what is laughingly known as my apartment.

501
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,550
Did you bring me here by force?

502
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,260
No, no, no. Quite the contrary.

503
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,350
Have I been here all night, alone?

504
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,940
If you don't count me, yes.

505
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,520
So I've spent the night here with you?

506
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,320
Well, now, I don't know that I'd use those words, exactly,

507
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,370
but from a certain angle, yes.

508
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,970
How do you do?

509
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,340
How do you do?

510
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,010
- And you are...
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

511
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,100
Delighted.

512
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,810
You don't know how delighted I am to meet you.

513
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,600
You may sit down.

514
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,480
Thank you very much.

515
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,610
What's your name?

516
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,990
You may call me Anya.

517
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,660
Thank you, Anya.

518
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,830
Would you like a cup of coffee?

519
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,500
- What time is it?
- About 1:30.

520
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,340
1:30! I must get dressed and go!

521
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,340
Why? What's your hurry? There's lots of time.

522
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,180
No, there isn't, and I've been quite enough trouble to you as it is.

523
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,510
Trouble?

524
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,220
You're not what I'd call trouble.

525
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,350
I'm not?

526
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,940
I'll run a bath for you.

527
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,580
There you are.

528
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,580
Here we go now.

529
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,210
There you are. That does it.

530
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,590
Give me a little slack, will you?

531
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,920
Irving! Why don't you answer the phone?

532
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,470
Look, this is Joe.

533
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,590
Irving, can you get over here in about five minutes?

534
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,260
No, I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy.

535
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,100
No.

536
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,810
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

537
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,810
Go and get into your next outfit, will you, honey? The canoe.

538
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,310
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

539
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,520
Look, Irving, I can't talk over the telephone.

540
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,690
One word in the wrong quarter,

541
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,150
and this whole thing might blow sky-high.

542
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,030
It's front-page stuff. That's all I can tell you.

543
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,280
It might be political or it might be a sensational scandal.

544
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,820
I'm not sure which, but it's a big story.

545
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,910
It's got to have pictures.

546
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,790
But I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy...

547
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,290
I'm busy now, and I'm meeting Francesca at Rocca's in a half an hour.

548
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,430
Don't understand.

549
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
There you are.

550
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,540
I was looking at all the people out here.

551
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,500
It must be fun to live in a place like this.

552
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,250
Yeah, it has its moments.

553
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,670
I can give you a running commentary on each apartment.

554
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,090
I must go.

555
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,420
I only waited to say good-bye.

556
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,720
Good-bye? Why, we've only just met.

557
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,560
- How about some breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

558
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,480
It must be a pretty important date to run off without eating.

559
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,190
It is.

560
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,860
Well, I'll go along with you, wherever you are going.

561
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,150
That's all right, thank you. I can find the place.

562
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,910
Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.

563
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,370
That's all right. Think nothing of it.

564
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,330
It was very considerate of you.

565
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,410
You must have been awfully uncomfortable on that couch.

566
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,580
No. Do it all the time!

567
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,050
- Good-bye, Mr. Bradley.
- Good-bye.

568
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,680
Go right through there and down all the steps.

569
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,100
Thank you.

570
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,130
Well, small world.

571
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,710
Yes. I almost forgot. Can you lend me some money?

572
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,010
Yeah, that's right. You didn't have any last night, did you?

573
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,480
How much was it that you wanted?

574
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,980
Well, I don't know how much I need. How much have you got?

575
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,650
Well, suppose we just split this 50-50? Here's 1,000 lira.

576
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,530
1,000? Can you really spare all that?

577
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,820
It's about $1.50.

578
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,530
Well, I'll arrange for it to be sent back to you.

579
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,410
What is your adress?

580
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,540
Via Margutta 51.

581
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,460
Via Margutta 51.

582
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,750
Joe Bradley.

583
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,380
Good-bye. Thank you.

584
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,520
Double my money, eh?

585
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,060
You tell me why double my money that way?

586
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,980
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

587
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,560
Yeah, tomorrow.

588
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,580
What a wonderful hair you have.

589
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,880
Just cut, thank you.

590
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,250
Just cut?

591
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,840
Well, then, cut so?

592
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,760
Higher.

593
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,220
Higher?

594
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,340
Here?

595
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,510
More.

596
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,020
- Here?
- Even more.

597
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,180
Where?

598
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,480
There.

599
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,730
There?

600
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,070
Are you sure, miss?

601
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,190
I'm quite sure, thank you.

602
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,660
All off?

603
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,990
All off.

604
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,700
Off.

605
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,050
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

606
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,050
Yes.

607
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,760
Off!

608
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,310
Off!

609
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,900
Off.

610
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,660
Off!

611
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,100
That's a nice little camera you have there.

612
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,480
It's nice.

613
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,400
You don't mind if I just borrow it, do you?

614
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,520
- Miss Weber!
- Bring it right back.

615
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,110
- Just for a couple of minutes.
- No.

616
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,110
Let go. It's my camera.

617
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,120
You musician, maybe?

618
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,410
You artist?

619
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,080
Painter?

620
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,130
I know. You model.

621
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,840
Model.

622
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,300
Thank you.

623
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,970
It's perfect.

624
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:10,220
You be nice without long hair.

625
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,810
Now is cool. Cool?

626
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,850
Yes. It's just what I wanted.

627
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,810
Now, why you not come dancing tonight with me?

628
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,320
You should see. Is so nice.

629
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,110
Is on a boat on the Tiber, the river by Sant'Angelo.

630
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,240
Moonlight, music, romantic.

631
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,910
Is very, very... Very!

632
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,580
Please? You come?

633
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,200
I wish I could.

634
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:44,340
But your friend, I not think they recognize you.

635
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,420
No, I don't think they will.

636
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,880
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

637
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,720
After 9:00, I will be there, dancing on river.

638
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,430
Remember, Sant'Angelo.

639
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,850
All my friends...

640
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,310
If you come, you will be most pretty of all girl.

641
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:08,980
Thank you.

642
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,990
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

643
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,040
Thank you.

644
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,780
1,000 lira.

645
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,150
No money.

646
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,580
I'm sorry. I've really no money.

647
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,700
Look.

648
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,920
I'm sorry.

649
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,660
Well, it's you.

650
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,450
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

651
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,830
Or is it?

652
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,710
Do you like it?

653
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,750
Yeah. Very much.

654
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,510
So that was your mysterious appointment.

655
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,590
Mr. Bradley, I have a confession to make.

656
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,010
Confession?

657
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,760
Yes. I ran away last night,

658
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,390
from school.

659
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,060
What was the matter?

660
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,980
Trouble with the teacher?

661
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,190
No, nothing like that.

662
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,810
Well, you don't just run away from school for nothing.

663
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,360
I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

664
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,740
They gave me something last night to make me sleep.

665
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,700
I see.

666
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,530
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

667
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,620
Well, look, before you do,

668
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,710
why don't you take a little time for yourself?

669
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,210
Maybe another hour.

670
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,880
Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

671
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,510
I could do some of the things I've always wanted to.

672
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,970
Like what?

673
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,470
You can't imagine.

674
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,300
I'd like to do just whatever I like the whole day long.

675
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,890
You mean, things like having your hair cut, eating gelato?

676
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:49,940
Yes, and I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe and look in shop windows,

677
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,360
walk in the rain.

678
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,940
Have fun, and maybe some excitement.

679
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,280
- Doesn't seem much to you, does it?
- It's great.

680
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,530
Tell you what.

681
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,780
Why don't we do all those things together?

682
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,370
Don't you have to work?

683
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,830
Work? No. Today's going to be a holiday.

684
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,000
But you don't want to do a lot of silly things.

685
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,170
Don't I?

686
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,420
First wish, one sidewalk cafe. Coming right up.

687
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,090
I know just the place. Rocca's.

688
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,930
What will the people at school say when they see your new haircut?

689
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,770
They'll have a fit.

690
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,650
What would they say if they knew I'd spent the night in your room?

691
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:42,900
Well, I tell you what. You don't tell your folks, and I won't tell mine.

692
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,440
It's a pact.

693
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,490
Well, what would you like to drink?

694
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,280
Champagne, please.

695
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,540
Champagne?

696
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,380
And cold coffee for me.

697
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,420
Must be quite a life you have in that school.

698
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,800
Champagne for lunch.

699
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,340
Only on special occasions.

700
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,640
For instance?

701
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,010
The last time was my father's anniversary.

702
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,310
Weding?

703
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:19,560
No. It was the 40th anniversary of the day he got his job.

704
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,650
Forty years on the job. What do you know about that?

705
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,150
What does he do?

706
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,530
Well, mostly you might call it public relations.

707
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,030
Well, that's hard work.

708
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,740
- Yes, I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

709
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,990
I've heard him complain about it.

710
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,910
Why doesn't he quit?

711
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,460
Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit,

712
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,460
unless it's actually unhealthy for them to continue.

713
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,960
Well, here's to his health, then.

714
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,300
You know, that's what everybody says.

715
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,930
It's all right?

716
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,520
Yes, thank you.

717
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,390
What is your work?

718
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,900
I'm in the selling game.

719
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,520
Really? How interesting.

720
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,270
What do you sell?

721
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,320
Fertilizer.

722
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,660
Chemicals. You know, chemicals.

723
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,370
Stuff like that.

724
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,210
Irving! Well, am I glad to see you!

725
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:31,250
Why? Did you forget your wallet?

726
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,880
Pull up a chair, Irving. Sit down with us.

727
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,300
Aren't you going to introduce me?

728
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,260
Yes. This is a very good friend of mine, Irving Radovich. Anya, Irving.

729
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,390
- Anya...
- Smith.

730
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,260
Hiya, Smitty.

731
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,600
Charmed.

732
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,850
Hey, anybody ever tell you you're a dead ringer for...

733
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Well, I guess I'll be going.

734
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,610
No, don't do anything like that, Irving. Sit down. Join us. Join us.

735
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,740
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

736
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:14,920
Tell me, Mr. Radovich, what is a ringer?

737
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Waiter?

738
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,290
It's an American term,

739
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:22,670
and it means anyone who has a great deal of charm.

740
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,590
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,310
Cousins.

742
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,480
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me all about his work.

743
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,310
I'd like to have heard that.

744
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,860
What do you do?

745
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,820
I'm in the same racket as Joe, only I'm...

746
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,320
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

747
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,110
- What are you...
- I'm sorry.

748
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,910
Look, I can take a hint. I'll see you around.

749
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,240
Your drink's just here.

750
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,830
Yeah, here's your drink right now, Irving. Take it easy.

751
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,330
I'm sorry about that. Sit down. That's a good fellow.

752
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,170
Have a... That's a boy.

753
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,510
You're...

754
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,010
You're twisting my arm, you know.

755
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,890
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

756
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,300
Spill? Who's been doing the spilling?

757
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,470
You.

758
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,060
- Me?
- Yeah.

759
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,140
Where did you find this loony?

760
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,270
You're okay. Here's to you.

761
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,820
Here's hoping for the best.

762
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,280
If it wasn't for that hair, I'd swear that...

763
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,910
Thanks.

764
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,500
You slipped, Irving. You slipped, you almost hurt yourself that time.

765
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:46,880
I slipped? I almost hurt myself?

766
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,040
- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain there.

767
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,500
Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe.

768
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,420
We'd better go in here and get it fixed up.

769
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,840
- Yeah, I'd like to...
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

770
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,130
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

771
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,680
- Come here, pal.
- Joe, now wait a minute.

772
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,760
What are you trying to do now? Take your hands off me.

773
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,520
- Have you got your lighter?
- What's that got to do with it?

774
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,980
- Have you got it?
- Yeah, but what are you trying to do?

775
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,980
Listen, what would you do for five grand?

776
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,480
- Five grand?
- Okay, look.

777
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,900
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

778
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,950
Look, Irving, this is my story. I dug it up. I've got to protect it.

779
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,740
She's really the...

780
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:23,410
Your tintypes are gonna make this little epic twice as valuable.

781
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,540
- "The princess goes slumming."
- You're in for 25% of the take.

782
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,290
- The take's five Gs.
- Minimum. Hennessy shook hands on it.

783
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,790
- That's $1,500.
- It's $1,250.

784
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,170
Okay. Now you shake.

785
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,340
Okay, now lend me 30,000.

786
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,720
30,000? That's 50 bucks. Are you gonna buy the crown jewels?

787
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
She's out there now drinking champagne that I can't pay for.

788
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,300
We've got to entertain her, don't we?

789
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,760
Joe, we can't go running around town with a hot princess.

790
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,600
Do you want in on this deal or don't you?

791
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,900
This I want back Saturday.

792
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,320
Okay. Now where's your lighter?

793
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,950
Let's go to work.

794
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,040
Better now?

795
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,790
- Your ear.
- My ear?

796
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,670
Yeah. Joe fixed it.

797
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,090
Would you care for a cigarette?

798
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,590
Yes, please.

799
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,840
You won't believe this, but it's my very first.

800
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,550
Your very first?

801
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,640
No smoking in school?

802
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,310
Your first cigarette.

803
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,730
There. The gizmo works.

804
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,030
Well, what's the verdict? Okay?

805
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,700
Nothing to it.

806
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,950
That's right. Nothing to it.

807
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,740
I'll stretch my legs a little here.

808
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,660
I'll pick this one up, Irving.

809
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,710
Yeah. You can afford it.

810
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,290
Well, what shall we do next? Shall we make out a little schedule?

811
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,340
Not that word, please.

812
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,470
I didn't mean a work... School schedule.

813
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,220
I meant a fun schedule.

814
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,640
Yes. Let's just go.

815
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,930
Well, how about you, Irving? Are you ready?

816
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,310
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

817
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:27,560
Francesca!

818
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,980
- This is...
- Smitty.

819
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,490
She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

820
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,320
Five grand, Irving.

821
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,530
- Joe!
- Where are you going now?

822
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,490
Honey, I gotta work. I'll call you tonight.

823
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,830
Look at those men!

824
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,450
They were supposed to be inconspicuous.

825
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,660
You asked for plain clothes.

826
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,850
Hey!

827
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,930
Stop! Come back here!

828
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,700
- Let me take this...
- No, no. Let it go. I can do it.

829
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,250
Yeah.

830
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,620
I'm going straight from now on.

831
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,090
American News Service? What did he mean?

832
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,010
Well, you know, you say you're with the press,

833
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,760
you can get away with anything.

834
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,640
Going to church to get married on a scooter, that's a hot one.

835
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,640
Joe's a wonderful liar.

836
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,520
Congratulations. Congratulations.

837
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,290
You don't have to look so worried. I won't hold you to it.

838
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,160
Thank you very much.

839
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,750
You don't have to be too grateful!

840
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,330
Okay, I won't.

841
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,550
I'm a good liar, too, aren't I, Mr. Bradley?

842
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,420
The best I ever met.

843
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,180
Thank you very much.

844
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,840
Say...

845
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,140
Come with me.

846
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,980
The mouth of truth.

847
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:33,190
The legend is that if you're given to lying and put your hand in there,

848
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,940
it'll be bitten off.

849
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,780
What a horrid idea.

850
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,490
Let's see you do it.

851
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,680
Let's see you do it.

852
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,140
Sure.

853
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,700
Hello.

854
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,790
You beast!

855
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,660
It was perfectly all right! You never hurt your hand!

856
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,170
I'm sorry. It's just a joke.

857
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,880
You never hurt your hand.

858
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,920
I'm sorry. You okay?

859
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,760
- Yes.
- All right. Let's go.

860
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,130
Look out!

861
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,350
I'll park at the corner.

862
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,620
What do they mean, all these inscriptions?

863
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,630
Well, each one represents a wish fulfilled.

864
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:28,250
It all started during the war when there was an air raid right out here,

865
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,840
a man with his four children was caught in the street.

866
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,590
They ran over against the wall right there for shelter

867
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,220
and prayed for safety.

868
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,350
Bombs fell very close, but no one was hurt.

869
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:43,520
Later on, the man came back and he put up the first of these tablets.

870
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
Since then, it's become a sort of a shrine.

871
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:48,440
People come, and whenever their wishes are granted,

872
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,650
they put up another one of these little plaques.

873
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,070
Lovely story.

874
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,780
Read some of the inscriptions.

875
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,920
Make a wish?

876
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,880
Tell the doctor?

877
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,220
Anyway, the chances of it being granted are very slight.

878
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,310
Well, what now?

879
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,190
I've heard of a wonderful place for dancing on a boat.

880
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,270
You mean, the barges down by Sant'Angelo?

881
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,860
Yes, couldn't we go there tonight?

882
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,110
- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

883
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,070
And then at midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin

884
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,660
and drive away in my glass slipper.

885
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,490
And that'll be the end of the fairytale.

886
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,080
Well, I guess Irving has to go now.

887
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,660
I do?

888
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,830
Yes, you know, that big business development of yours

889
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,000
that you have to attend to?

890
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,380
Oh, the development.

891
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,170
Yes, can't afford not to take care of that.

892
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,840
Yeah. I'll see you later, Smitty.

893
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,220
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

894
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,070
Two, please.

895
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,230
Hello.

896
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,650
Hello.

897
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,870
Mr. Bradley, if you don't mind my saying so,

898
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,000
I think you are a ringer.

899
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,500
A what?

900
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,790
Oh!

901
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,540
Thanks very much.

902
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,920
You've spent the whole day doing things I've always wanted to.

903
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,090
Why?

904
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,380
I don't know. It seemed the thing to do.

905
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,890
I've never heard of anybody so kind.

906
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,850
It wasn't any trouble.

907
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,390
Or so completely unselfish.

908
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,320
Let's have a drink at the bar.

909
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,910
There you are!

910
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,700
I look for you a long time. I think maybe you not come.

911
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,830
Off... All off!

912
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,040
It's nice without, isn't it?

913
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,250
Cool.

914
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,750
Very, very good.

915
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,590
This is Mr. Bradley.

916
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,550
I, Mario Delani.

917
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,130
Old friends?

918
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:06,130
Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon. He invited me here tonight.

919
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,680
Well, what did you say the name was?

920
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,140
Delani. Mario Delani.

921
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:14,270
Mario Delani. I'm very glad to know you.

922
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,940
Me, too.

923
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,400
May I enjoy myself... The pleasure... Do you mind?

924
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,990
No, no. Go right ahead.

925
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,400
Thank you.

926
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,050
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

927
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,220
Who's Smitty dancing with?

928
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,060
The barber.

929
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,020
Cut her hair this afternoon. Made a date for tonight.

930
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,230
The princess and the barber.

931
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,880
What is it?

932
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,650
August.

933
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,370
Thank you!

934
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,000
Bye.

935
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,430
Your Highness.

936
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,440
You'll dance quietly towards the entrance.

937
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,230
There is a car waiting.

938
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,310
- No.
- Your Highness, please.

939
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,860
You've made a mistake.

940
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,610
Let me go. Will you let me go?

941
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,030
Mr. Bradley! Let me go, will you? Mr. Bradley!

942
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,220
Let go!

943
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,600
You...

944
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,060
Hit him again, Smitty!

945
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,320
- Joe, here are my car keys.
- The police. The police. Come on.

946
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,620
The other side of the bridge.

947
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,060
All right?

948
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,220
Fine. How are you?

949
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:18,430
Fine.

950
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,650
Say, you know, you were great back there.

951
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,860
You weren't so bad yourself.

952
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,720
I guess we'd better get Irving's car and get out of here.

953
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,120
This is The American Hour from Rome,

954
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,120
continuing our program of musical selections.

955
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,690
Everything ruined?

956
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,110
No. They'll be dry in a minute.

957
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,490
Suits you.

958
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,990
You should always wear my clothes.

959
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,200
It seems I do.

960
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,750
I thought a little wine might be good.

961
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,290
Shall I cook something?

962
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,380
No kitchen. Nothing to cook. I always eat out.

963
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,050
Do you like that?

964
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,550
Life isn't always what one likes.

965
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,890
Is it?

966
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,350
No, it isn't.

967
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,110
- Tired?
- A little.

968
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:43,570
You've had quite a day.

969
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:45,110
A wonderful day.

970
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,820
This is The American Hour from Rome,

971
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:50,410
broadcasting a special news bulletin in English and Italian.

972
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,700
Tonight, there is no further word

973
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,990
from the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome,

974
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,370
where she was taken ill yesterday

975
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:58,500
on the last leg of her European goodwill tour.

976
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,920
This has given rise to rumors that her condition may be serious,

977
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
which is causing alarm and anxiety among the people in her country.

978
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,010
- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

979
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,350
May I have a little more wine?

980
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,640
I'm sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner.

981
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,310
Did you learn how in school?

982
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,190
I'm a good cook.

983
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:26,860
I could earn my living at it.

984
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,900
I can sew, too, and clean a house and iron.

985
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,030
I learned to do all those things.

986
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:35,360
I just haven't had the chance to do it for anyone.

987
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,370
Well, it looks like I'll have to move

988
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,710
and get myself a place with a kitchen.

989
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,760
Yes.

990
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,860
I shall have to go now.

991
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,130
Anya...

992
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,300
There's something that I want to tell you.

993
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,720
No, please.

994
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,270
Nothing.

995
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,370
I must go and get dressed.

996
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:51,200
Stop at the next corner, please.

997
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,370
Okay.

998
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,720
Here?

999
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,300
Yes.

1000
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,350
I have to leave you now.

1001
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,900
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

1002
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,530
You must stay in the car and drive away.

1003
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:43,790
Promise not to watch me go beyond the corner.

1004
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:48,080
Just drive away and leave me,

1005
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,710
as I leave you.

1006
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,840
All right.

1007
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,930
I don't know how to say good-bye.

1008
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,440
I can't think of any words.

1009
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,360
Don't try.

1010
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:14,010
Your Royal Highness, 24 hours, they can't all be blank.

1011
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,300
They are not.

1012
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,230
But what explanation am I to offer Their Majesties?

1013
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:26,350
I was indisposed. I am better.

1014
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:33,990
Ma'am, you must appreciate that I have my duty to perform,

1015
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:37,280
just as Your Royal Highness has her duty.

1016
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,990
Your Excellency, I trust you will not find it necessary

1017
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,950
to use that word again.

1018
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:49,210
Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country,

1019
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,830
I would not have come back tonight,

1020
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,680
or, indeed, ever again.

1021
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:12,850
And now, since I understand we have a very full schedule today,

1022
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,110
you have my permission to withdraw.

1023
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,500
No milk and crackers.

1024
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,430
That will be all, thank you, Countess.

1025
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,150
Is it true? Did you really get it?

1026
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:50,490
Did I get what?

1027
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,570
The princess story. The exclusive. Did you get it?

1028
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,820
No, no, I didn't get it.

1029
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,700
What? But that's impossible.

1030
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,160
Have a cup of coffee or something?

1031
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,490
- Joe, you can't hold out on me.
- Who's holding out on you?

1032
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,660
- You are.
- What are you talking about?

1033
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,000
I know too much.

1034
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,250
First you come into my office

1035
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:06,170
and ask about an exclusive on the princess.

1036
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,710
Next, you disappear.

1037
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:10,210
Then I get the rumor from my contact at the embassy

1038
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,340
that the princess isn't sick at all and she's out on the town.

1039
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,800
What kind of a newspaperman are you?

1040
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,130
You believe every two-bit rumor that comes your way?

1041
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,720
Yeah, and a lot of other rumors

1042
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,100
about a shindig on a barge down by the river

1043
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:22,930
and the arrest of eight Secret Service men

1044
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,230
from a country which shall be nameless.

1045
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:28,350
And then comes the news of the lady's miraculous recovery.

1046
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,980
It all ads up.

1047
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,520
And don't think by playing hard to get you'll raise the price of that story.

1048
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,110
A deal's a deal.

1049
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:38,360
Now, come on, come on, where is that story?

1050
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,410
I have no story.

1051
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,580
- Then what was the idea of...
- Joe!

1052
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:49,910
- Man, wait till you see these.
- Irving...

1053
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,040
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy. You got here at the right time.

1054
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,750
- Irving...
- Wait till you get a look...

1055
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:56,920
What's the idea?

1056
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,670
What do you mean charging in here and spilling things all over my place?

1057
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,800
Who's spilling?

1058
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,720
You did. I spoke to you about that once before.

1059
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,550
Don't you remember?

1060
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:05,600
Joe, look at my pants.

1061
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,720
Yeah, you'd better come in here and dry them off, Irving.

1062
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,390
Nuts to that.

1063
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,480
- Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?
- Irving...

1064
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,690
Smitty?

1065
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,890
- Mr. Hennessy...
- Irving...

1066
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,350
Wait till...

1067
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,730
There you go again, Irving.

1068
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:21,690
Joe.

1069
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,820
- All right, save that till later.
- Listen...

1070
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,570
You're here early, anyway. Why don't you go home and shave?

1071
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,620
Shave?

1072
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,330
Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.

1073
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,960
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1074
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,080
What are you two guys up to? Who's Smitty?

1075
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,290
He's a guy that we met. You wouldn't care for him.

1076
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,500
What am I supposed to look at?

1077
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:44,340
No, just a couple of Irving's dames. You wouldn't like them.

1078
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,970
Maybe you would.

1079
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:49,260
Don't change the subject. When you came back into my office yesterday...

1080
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,390
Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon, I thought I had a good lead,

1081
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:52,930
but I was wrong.

1082
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,980
That's all there is to it. There is no story.

1083
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,850
Okay.

1084
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,690
She's holding the press interview today. Same time, same place.

1085
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,280
Maybe that's one story you can get.

1086
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:09,950
And you owe me 500 bucks!

1087
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:11,990
Take it out of my salary, 50 bucks a week.

1088
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,820
Don't think I won't.

1089
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,790
Hey, what gives?

1090
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:20,460
Have we had a better offer?

1091
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:24,790
Irving, I don't know just how to tell you this, but...

1092
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,170
Wait till I sit down.

1093
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:35,300
Well, in regard to the story that goes with these,

1094
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,930
there is no story.

1095
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:42,140
Why not?

1096
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,480
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1097
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:02,950
Hey, the pictures came out pretty well. You want to have a look at them?

1098
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,470
How about a blowup from a negative that size?

1099
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:22,680
- That's her first cigarette.
- Oh, yeah. At Rocca's.

1100
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,760
Hey, the mouth of truth.

1101
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,850
Oh, you want to know the caption I had in mind there?

1102
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:30,600
"Barber cuts in."

1103
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,900
Well, here's the one I figured would be the key shot for the layout.

1104
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:38,190
"The wall where wishes come true."

1105
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,820
Joe, that's good.

1106
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,200
Lead off with that, then follow up with the wishes.

1107
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:45,910
I dug that up out of the file.

1108
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,990
"Princess inspects police."

1109
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,200
Yeah.

1110
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,210
"Police inspects princess."

1111
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,040
How about it?

1112
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,090
- Joe, I got a topper for you.
- Pretty good...

1113
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:00,670
Wow!

1114
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,130
- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1115
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,010
Is that a shot, Joe?

1116
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,220
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1117
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,260
Yeah. No, how about this?

1118
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:10,260
"Crowned head."

1119
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:13,350
I get it! That's... Joe, you got...

1120
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,730
She's fair game, Joe.

1121
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,030
It's always open season on princesses.

1122
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,660
You must be out of your mind.

1123
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,780
Yeah, I know, but...

1124
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:36,330
Well, look, I can't prevent you from selling the pictures if you want to.

1125
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:39,580
- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah!

1126
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,970
You going to the interview?

1127
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,390
Are you going?

1128
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:53,010
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1129
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,890
Yeah.

1130
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,480
I'll see you.

1131
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:19,160
It ain't much, but it's home.

1132
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:33,260
Ladies and gentlemen, please approach.

1133
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,870
Her Royal Highness.

1134
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:37,690
Your Royal Highness, the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

1135
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:15,730
Ladies and gentlemen,

1136
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:18,900
Her Royal Highness will now answer your questions.

1137
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,570
I believe at the outset, Your Highness,

1138
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:25,070
that I should express the pleasure of all of us

1139
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:27,950
at your recovery from the recent illness.

1140
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:31,740
Thank you.

1141
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:35,950
Does Your Highness believe that federation would be

1142
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,580
a possible solution to Europe's economic problems?

1143
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:44,090
I am in favor of any measure

1144
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:47,710
which would lead to closer cooperation in Europe.

1145
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:52,050
And what, in the opinion of Your Highness,

1146
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:55,430
is the outlook for friendship among nations?

1147
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,640
I have every faith in it,

1148
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,060
as I have faith in relations between people.

1149
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:16,200
May I say, speaking for my own press service,

1150
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:20,830
we believe that Your Highness's faith will not be unjustified.

1151
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:27,130
I am so glad to hear you say it.

1152
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:33,970
Which of the cities visited did Your Highness enjoy the most?

1153
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:45,100
Each in its own way...

1154
01:51:48,230 --> 01:51:52,570
Each in its own way was unforgettable.

1155
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,480
It would be difficult to...

1156
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,110
Rome.

1157
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:02,450
By all means, Rome.

1158
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:12,080
I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live.

1159
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,930
Despite your indisposition, Your Highness?

1160
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:25,760
Despite that.

1161
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:29,060
Photographs may now be taken.

1162
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,880
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.

1163
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:04,590
