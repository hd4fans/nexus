1
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,186
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:41,985
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,523
Open it.

4
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:49,901
Take this.

5
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,565
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,562
Yes.

7
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,608
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,902
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,108
OK.

10
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:36,564
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,027
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,655
Yeah.

13
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:22,146
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:25,647
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,239
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,610
A face with features...

17
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,447
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,066
I have participated in

19
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,645
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,271
carried out in the world...

21
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:46,813
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,270
Good...

23
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,936
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,652
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,855
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,696
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:53,527
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,524
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,610
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:32,687
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,440
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,735
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,615
Your skin is softer than I tohught.

34
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,110
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,485
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:49,730
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:51,905
In any case...

38
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:56,317
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,274
Here it is...

40
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,110
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,781
Thank you.

42
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:25,531
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,735
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,529
I was hasty.

45
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,653
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,489
No.

47
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,690
And now?

48
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:49,940
No.

49
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,655
Now!

50
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,322
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,735
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:58,854
in recent years.

53
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,651
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:05,029
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,442
No.

56
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,653
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,112
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:16,270
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:19,234
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:20,318
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,404
and the results...

62
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:27,272
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,190
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,278
they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:33,155
in human mammals.

66
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:38,729
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:40,441
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,778
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,697
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:50,773
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,613
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,237
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,988
and it smells different.

74
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,738
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:02,394
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:05,062
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,154
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,864
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:13,067
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,149
Excuse me.

81
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,444
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,985
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:23,863
By mutating it.

84
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:26,149
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,898
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,402
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:36,071
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:37,859
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:39,738
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,316
You're insane!

91
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,773
You know the application
of transgenetic therepy...

92
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:46,447
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:47,652
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,437
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:54,609
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,987
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:01,854
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,316
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,397
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,860
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,364
Don't go on!

102
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,569
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,526
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,812
But even so...

105
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:20,272
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:22,397
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,071
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,112
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:30,192
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:35,567
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:38,152
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,942
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:41,980
I remember...

114
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,988
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,355
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:49,274
And it still is.

117
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,772
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:55,153
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,104
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:03,946
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,822
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,521
I don't know.

123
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:12,690
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,572
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,187
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,736
What do you mean?

127
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,442
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,281
No.

129
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:26,234
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,281
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,982
Yes...

132
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:36,695
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,022
And now what?

134
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:48,240
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,195
and smoke it.

136
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,487
I mean us.

137
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:54,941
Me.

138
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,148
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,439
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:02,645
When?

141
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,276
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,905
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,528
Live together.

144
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:14,903
Live together?

145
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:18,280
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,532
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,777
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,233
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:31,156
That's it!

150
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,322
Here.

151
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,443
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,405
I'm yours.

153
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:58,149
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,398
Did I say that?

156
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:05,235
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,607
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:11,406
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,233
In this pocket.

160
00:21:55,532 --> 00:22:02,649
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:11,859
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,445
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:18,068
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:20,231
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:23,110
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,519
No.

167
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:28,816
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,899
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:36,232
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:38,730
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,738
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:45,813
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,147
You're sick.

174
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:49,822
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:53,070
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:56,526
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,693
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,030
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,907
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,405
What do you want?

181
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:51,479
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:52,812
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,235
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,192
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:00,941
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:02,987
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,315
Zeca!

188
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:22,821
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:24,690
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:26,233
Open the door!

191
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:32,071
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,898
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,780
Little tiger!

194
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,277
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,197
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:49,191
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:53,897
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,364
How did you find us?

199
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:24,572
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,482
He was giving a...

201
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:29,899
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,897
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,027
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,404
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:39,609
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

206
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,031
Brute!

207
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,362
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,197
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,487
<i>and the daring robbery commited
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,522
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:03,936
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:06,527
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

213
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:12,771
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,355
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:19,938
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,026
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,405
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:30,652
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,063
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:35,734
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:37,696
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:41,692
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:44,064
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,614
Hide you here?

225
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:46,770
Not a chance.

226
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:49,734
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:49,823 --> 00:26:51,814
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:55,480
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,321
Robert?

230
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,439
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,607
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,240
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,697
after what you did?

234
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,896
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:14,897
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:18,312
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:21,152
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,322
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:27,233
Even better.

240
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,902
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,156
Where are you going?

242
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,693
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:43,654
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,104
What's this?

245
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,781
It's a film!

246
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:14,649
Go away!

247
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,104
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,399
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,114
Mom...

250
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:50,649
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:55,277
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,443
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:00,072
How could it be her?

254
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,148
Get out of here!

255
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,691
Keep away!

256
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:12,780
Marilia?

257
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:16,020
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:18,066
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,112
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,821
<i>Marilia?

261
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,649
Marilia!

262
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:48,906
There.

263
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:18,194
Who is it?

264
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,279
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:22,197
I can't.

266
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,238
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:27,071
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:29,610
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:54,854
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,278
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:08,403
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,732
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,488
No, where is it?

274
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,902
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,652
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:33,023
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:37,103
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:47,103
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,687
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:51,151
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:56,769
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:00,484
It all fit before.

283
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:48,780
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:51,061
No.

285
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,736
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:01,531
He saved me.

287
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:05,147
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,278
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,571
You're saying that...

290
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,398
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:14,609
No!

292
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,855
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:21,905
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:24,603
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,655
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:30,986
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:32,905
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,364
Great.

299
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,568
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:42,397
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,947
Yes.

302
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,021
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,112
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:55,571
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:59,823
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:06,109
Listen...

307
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:07,813
What?

308
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:10,193
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:14,192
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,362
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:24,780
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:26,572
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:28,822
It's very big.

314
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:31,697
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,198
Yes...

316
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,865
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:40,689
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:55,982
Kill her!

319
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:58,649
Kill them both!

320
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,487
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:32,698 --> 00:37:36,064
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:40,278
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:42,316
Yes.

324
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:44,608
They're brothers...

325
00:37:45,615 --> 00:37:47,736
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,813
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:56,527
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:02,403
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:07,854
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,361
It's my fault.

331
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:22,106
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:25,323
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:27,735
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:32,897
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:37,531
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:43,235
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,233
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:52,566
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:58,360
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:04,318
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,489
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:18,112
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:22,113
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,855
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,815
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,443
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,193
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:40,021
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,689
But she...

350
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:52,985
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,437
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:08,358
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,358
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,065
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:19,604
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:24,402
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:28,781
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:33,815
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,652
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:41,780
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:47,029
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:53,980
One day...

363
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:58,862
whe she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:04,111
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:08,520
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:13,532
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:20,490
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,233
And it was...

369
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:27,356
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,907
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:12,489
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:23,316
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:26,312
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:32,692
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,021
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:50,613
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:54,690
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,859
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:02,782 --> 00:43:04,938
Through the window.

380
00:43:44,573 --> 00:43:47,773
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:49,399
Did you pray?

382
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,737
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:43:57,948 --> 00:43:59,820
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:41,191
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:42,905
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:47,363
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:50,023
As you wish.

388
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:55,530
But hold me!

389
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:05,020
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:08,774
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,781
Thank you!

392
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,652
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:38,194
Sleep, my love.

394
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:00,398
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:34,985
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:37,692
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:40,115 --> 00:46:42,734
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:45,270
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:54,899
Your daughter is getting on well
with my neices.

400
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:57,357
She seems much better...

401
00:46:57,532 --> 00:47:00,234
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:03,940
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:07,362
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:22,774
To you!

405
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,734
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:18,405
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:32,358
Excuse me.

408
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:43,357
Norma!

409
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,031
Norma!

410
00:50:45,448 --> 00:50:47,190
Norma!

411
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,030
Norma!

412
00:50:49,198 --> 00:50:50,774
Norma!

413
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,438
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:01,854
There, there!

415
00:52:09,948 --> 00:52:11,145
What about this one?

416
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,437
Yes, but...

417
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:13,693
no.

418
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:14,937
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:17,236
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:19,777
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:19,865 --> 00:52:22,354
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,983
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:25,489
No stripes.

424
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:38,239
Something graphic?

425
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:40,984
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,987
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:46,190
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:50,073 --> 00:52:51,235
Cristina...

429
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,231
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:56,231
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:52:56,365 --> 00:52:57,906
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:52:58,073 --> 00:53:00,644
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:04,356
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,481
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:09,321
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:11,314
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:13,694
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:15,941
In any case...

439
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:19,772
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:19,907 --> 00:53:21,944
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,189
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,531
I'm off.

443
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,364
Where to?

444
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,864
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,192
How come?

446
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:35,812
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:38,442
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:39,687
Were you invited?

449
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:41,856
Jorge knows one of the neices.

450
00:53:41,948 --> 00:53:43,690
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:46,979
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,396
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:51,323 --> 00:53:52,651
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:54,281
Hello.

455
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,736
My wife has left us...

456
00:53:57,823 --> 00:54:00,359
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:03,403
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:04,948 --> 00:54:06,322
Well...

459
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:08,736
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:14,946
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,690
They're very nice.

462
00:54:17,032 --> 00:54:19,022
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:22,736
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:23,730
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:25,233
It certainly is.

466
00:54:25,323 --> 00:54:26,697
But...

467
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:29,402
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:31,570
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:34,655
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,446
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:36,532 --> 00:54:39,613
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,312
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:31,156
What a party!

474
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:32,739
Fresh air!

475
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,523
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:42,405
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:43,282 --> 00:55:44,858
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,780
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,277
All the better, right?

480
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:08,941
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,066
Stoned?

482
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:13,529
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,030
Yes.

484
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:18,647
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:22,447
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,814
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:25,907 --> 00:56:27,565
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:30,402
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:31,811
Shit!

490
00:56:31,948 --> 00:56:33,904
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:34,032 --> 00:56:35,359
High?

492
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:37,233
Yes.

493
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,147
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:46,356
No. Are you?

495
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:49,276
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:11,108
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,608
And this jacket!

498
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:24,026
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:28,229
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,769
Wait.

501
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,488
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,523
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:19,947
and different.

504
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:23,821
I'm different too.

505
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:26,272
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:29,152
No.

507
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,278
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:32,774
I don't know.

509
00:58:33,448 --> 00:58:36,980
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:38,484
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:40,529
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:40,657 --> 00:58:42,398
with all my affection.

513
00:59:41,907 --> 00:59:47,192
No!

514
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:54,111
Shut up!

515
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:58,730
Stop!

516
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:34,572
Cristina...

517
01:01:34,698 --> 01:01:37,945
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,614
Yes...

519
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,488
but where are you going?

520
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,524
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:44,698 --> 01:01:46,274
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:47,816
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:49,530
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:52,403
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:53,989
It's best not to.

526
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:57,447
I'm going out.

527
01:01:57,907 --> 01:01:59,814
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:01:59,865 --> 01:02:00,813
Yes.

529
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:06,108
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:06,198 --> 01:02:08,901
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:08,948 --> 01:02:11,982
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,278
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:17,777
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:12,157 --> 01:03:15,357
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:03:56,282 --> 01:03:57,905
Son of a bitch!

536
01:03:58,823 --> 01:04:01,229
Bastard!

537
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:10,947
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:14,362
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:12,528
Help!

540
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:18,191
<i>Help!

541
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,941
Come in.

542
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,234
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:38,608
Thank you.

544
01:06:40,657 --> 01:06:42,647
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:43,823 --> 01:06:48,232
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:51,483
And the body?

547
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,234
Nothing.

548
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,896
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,280
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,196
My son is alive.

551
01:07:06,865 --> 01:07:10,029
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:11,696
but my son?

553
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:15,687
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:21,731
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:21,823 --> 01:07:23,779
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:27,906
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,561
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,940
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:39,232
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:39,282 --> 01:07:41,023
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:41,073 --> 01:07:42,401
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:46,021
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:03,323 --> 01:08:05,279
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:19,907 --> 01:08:23,604
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:28,731
Norma...

566
01:08:30,615 --> 01:08:31,645
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:32,942
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:33,032 --> 01:08:35,983
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:39,858
Where are you going?

570
01:08:46,782 --> 01:08:48,488
Where are you going?

571
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:58,522
Norma, love.

572
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:04,110
Everything OK?

573
01:09:04,157 --> 01:09:06,562
Yes.

574
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,940
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:15,355
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,531
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:21,108
We tried...

578
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,773
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:26,523
She rips it off.

580
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:32,399
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:36,814
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:39,064
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:42,190
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:42,323 --> 01:09:43,697
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:43,782 --> 01:09:46,152
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,989
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:50,073 --> 01:09:51,353
Maybe...

588
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:54,316
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,109
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:09:57,157 --> 01:09:59,776
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:09:59,907 --> 01:10:00,937
How could I know...

592
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,941
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:29,948 --> 01:11:34,819
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:34,907 --> 01:11:37,821
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:42,569
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,780
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,982
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:48,115 --> 01:11:51,196
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:52,157 --> 01:11:54,941
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:07,739
Turn around!

601
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:41,234
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:44,647
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,778
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:25,032 --> 01:13:26,524
Eat.

605
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:29,358
Thank you!

606
01:13:35,365 --> 01:13:37,605
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:40,902
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:46,982
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:53,188
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:53,365 --> 01:13:55,403
We have to talk.

611
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:24,822
My condolences.

612
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:30,314
We did what we could.

613
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:33,104
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,112
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:36,821
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:36,865 --> 01:14:39,614
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:45,148
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,402
Yes.

619
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:49,648
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,821
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:55,395
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:15,522
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:18,770
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:30,772
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,607
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:42,106
The toys...

627
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:43,940
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,311
We buried her today.

629
01:15:50,907 --> 01:15:52,814
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:01,907 --> 01:16:04,573
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:07,282 --> 01:16:09,319
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:11,772
That's a good question.

633
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:06,193
Yes?

634
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,614
<i>It's us.

635
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,149
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:29,858
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:32,146
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:34,279
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,363
Good evening.

640
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:40,776
You're late.

641
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:42,773
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:45,865
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:48,271
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:48,782 --> 01:17:52,656
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:36,944
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,446
He isn't.

647
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:43,362
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,488
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,945
What's happened?

650
01:19:28,573 --> 01:19:30,529
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:33,438
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,612
No...

653
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:34,109
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:35,821
It's very important.

655
01:20:38,157 --> 01:20:41,487
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:46,439
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:46,532 --> 01:20:49,695
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:49,948 --> 01:20:51,228
You...

659
01:20:52,532 --> 01:20:55,364
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:20:55,448 --> 01:20:58,814
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:20:59,948 --> 01:21:04,570
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:07,027
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,114
In this case...

664
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:14,898
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:17,407 --> 01:21:21,780
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:24,115 --> 01:21:26,355
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:29,734
but in a few months...

668
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:32,946
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:33,073 --> 01:21:34,780
and the skin...

670
01:21:34,948 --> 01:21:39,024
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:51,105
This is very good.

672
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:55,360
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:57,107
Four weeks.

674
01:21:57,448 --> 01:21:58,989
Can I go now?

675
01:21:59,407 --> 01:22:01,978
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,445
But we've just started.

677
01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:21,320
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:23,365 --> 01:22:25,984
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:30,443
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:38,323 --> 01:22:40,859
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:44,567
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:45,948 --> 01:22:50,191
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:51,782 --> 01:22:53,819
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:53,865 --> 01:22:58,190
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:22:59,157 --> 01:23:04,028
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:04,073 --> 01:23:08,612
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:10,488
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:35,312
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:42,605
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:46,906
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,608
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,693
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:02,782 --> 01:24:07,238
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:14,731
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:14,823 --> 01:24:18,154
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:23,113
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:25,899
like a second skin.

698
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:28,864
Put it on.

699
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:16,652
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:37,115 --> 01:25:38,442
Bitch!

701
01:26:27,073 --> 01:26:28,447
Stop!

702
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,229
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:34,365 --> 01:26:36,071
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:51,948 --> 01:26:53,773
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:53,823 --> 01:26:55,897
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:26:57,073 --> 01:26:58,815
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:35,613
We were lucky.

708
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:39,155
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:23,073 --> 01:28:25,858
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:28,865 --> 01:28:33,190
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:20,323 --> 01:30:22,729
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:25,229
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:25,323 --> 01:30:26,982
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:49,782 --> 01:30:52,353
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:30:52,407 --> 01:30:55,274
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:31:15,865 --> 01:31:19,065
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:31:19,532 --> 01:31:22,316
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:31:22,407 --> 01:31:24,196
<i>a place to which...

719
01:31:24,282 --> 01:31:26,605
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:31:26,657 --> 01:31:29,323
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:31:29,865 --> 01:31:32,152
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:31:32,407 --> 01:31:35,321
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:39,694
<i>It's a flace where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,363
<i>freedom.

725
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:43,196
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:31:43,282 --> 01:31:45,901
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:50,315
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:31:50,782 --> 01:31:52,772
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,022
My Cigarral!

730
01:32:56,865 --> 01:32:58,772
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:00,323 --> 01:33:03,026
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:03,157 --> 01:33:06,854
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:10,073
I tohught you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:12,613
I thought that...

735
01:33:12,782 --> 01:33:16,029
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:16,573 --> 01:33:18,730
My poor child.

737
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,064
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:23,604
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:24,282 --> 01:33:26,154
As you wish.

740
01:33:27,157 --> 01:33:29,562
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:31,407 --> 01:33:33,362
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:35,191
I'm parched.

743
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,195
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:45,313
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:45,532 --> 01:33:49,063
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:51,777
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:51,907 --> 01:33:56,196
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:33:56,323 --> 01:33:58,113
I'll explain.

749
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:01,479
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:01,573 --> 01:34:05,484
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:11,484
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,946
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:34,657 --> 01:34:37,110
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:37,157 --> 01:34:38,697
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:41,442
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:49,365 --> 01:34:50,858
Who is she?

757
01:34:52,115 --> 01:34:54,236
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:34:55,032 --> 01:34:56,773
What's she doing?

759
01:34:57,657 --> 01:34:59,363
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:01,777
I can see that.

761
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:05,357
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:07,782 --> 01:35:09,986
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:10,115 --> 01:35:12,899
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:13,282 --> 01:35:16,233
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:17,907 --> 01:35:20,858
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:25,815
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:26,657 --> 01:35:28,943
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:29,073 --> 01:35:32,735
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:32,865 --> 01:35:37,072
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:48,282 --> 01:35:51,730
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:06,776
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,980
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:29,399
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:31,698 --> 01:36:34,317
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:34,448 --> 01:36:36,238
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:36,573 --> 01:36:39,773
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:41,073 --> 01:36:42,614
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:45,732
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,729
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:55,608
Thank you.

781
01:37:58,157 --> 01:37:59,898
Good morning.

782
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:07,405
Breakfast.

783
01:38:10,907 --> 01:38:12,696
Thank you.

784
01:38:22,615 --> 01:38:24,487
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:24,657 --> 01:38:26,694
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:31,070
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:41,573 --> 01:38:43,232
Last night...

788
01:38:44,073 --> 01:38:45,945
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:46,073 --> 01:38:48,988
we talked alot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:53,814
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:38:55,782 --> 01:38:58,898
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:38:59,698 --> 01:39:02,317
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:05,611
that I was free.

794
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:10,773
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:12,032 --> 01:39:13,987
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:17,027
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:17,657 --> 01:39:19,896
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:29,282 --> 01:39:32,031
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:33,157 --> 01:39:36,605
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:36,698 --> 01:39:38,440
She promised not to.

801
01:39:38,532 --> 01:39:41,779
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:42,323 --> 01:39:46,152
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:47,774
That's enough!

804
01:39:50,823 --> 01:39:53,063
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:56,988
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:39:57,448 --> 01:40:00,896
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:01,073 --> 01:40:02,649
Thank you.

808
01:40:18,657 --> 01:40:20,315
Come along, child!

809
01:40:26,782 --> 01:40:28,819
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:29,365 --> 01:40:32,647
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:34,407 --> 01:40:37,772
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:39,981
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:40,865 --> 01:40:42,488
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:42,573 --> 01:40:46,069
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:47,823 --> 01:40:50,738
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:50,823 --> 01:40:52,446
It's not just that.

817
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,520
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,819
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:04,739
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:04,865 --> 01:41:07,697
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,236
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:15,073 --> 01:41:17,609
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,904
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:41:55,157 --> 01:41:57,147
Are you still here?

825
01:41:58,532 --> 01:41:59,776
I'm leaving now...

826
01:41:59,907 --> 01:42:03,568
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:07,865 --> 01:42:09,571
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:09,698 --> 01:42:11,855
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:12,615 --> 01:42:16,230
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:17,562
as you can see.

831
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:19,239
And?

832
01:42:19,948 --> 01:42:22,354
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:22,615 --> 01:42:24,405
without hormones.

834
01:42:24,532 --> 01:42:26,522
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:27,032 --> 01:42:30,444
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:30,573 --> 01:42:34,069
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:38,448 --> 01:42:42,063
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:42,157 --> 01:42:44,313
Don't go there.

839
01:42:44,448 --> 01:42:46,854
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:47,282 --> 01:42:48,230
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:48,323 --> 01:42:51,072
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,817
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:42:53,865 --> 01:42:56,780
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:42:57,448 --> 01:43:01,489
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:01,573 --> 01:43:03,813
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:04,115 --> 01:43:05,229
You told us...

847
01:43:05,323 --> 01:43:07,942
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,821
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:09,907 --> 01:43:13,237
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:13,323 --> 01:43:15,195
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:15,532 --> 01:43:19,442
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:19,532 --> 01:43:21,487
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:21,573 --> 01:43:23,611
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:23,657 --> 01:43:26,276
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:28,615 --> 01:43:31,151
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:34,448 --> 01:43:37,316
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:38,782 --> 01:43:42,562
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:45,948 --> 01:43:46,896
And...

859
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,945
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:50,323 --> 01:43:52,065
A cream?

861
01:43:54,323 --> 01:43:56,990
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:02,104
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:02,448 --> 01:44:04,071
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,026
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:30,115 --> 01:44:31,691
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:41,365 --> 01:44:43,107
Thank you.

867
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:46,191
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:13,115 --> 01:45:14,857
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:16,566
Yes.

870
01:45:18,657 --> 01:45:20,647
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:24,152
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:24,948 --> 01:45:26,690
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:26,782 --> 01:45:28,938
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,526
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:46,532 --> 01:45:48,688
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:48,823 --> 01:45:49,985
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:50,073 --> 01:45:52,644
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:52,823 --> 01:45:55,940
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:29,573 --> 01:46:32,820
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:48,071
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:52,066
Not yet.

882
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,364
Come on...

883
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:02,821
What are you doing?

884
01:47:05,448 --> 01:47:07,273
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,398
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:10,282 --> 01:47:12,023
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:13,532 --> 01:47:15,487
But you promised!

888
01:47:15,615 --> 01:47:17,487
I lied.

889
01:47:56,865 --> 01:47:58,322
Robert?

890
01:48:00,282 --> 01:48:01,739
Robert?

891
01:48:01,865 --> 01:48:03,406
He's asleep.

892
01:48:04,698 --> 01:48:06,440
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:06,698 --> 01:48:08,239
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:11,399
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:18,073 --> 01:48:19,649
Robert!

896
01:48:20,573 --> 01:48:22,232
My son!

897
01:48:33,282 --> 01:48:36,564
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:40,315
Where are you?

899
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,528
I knew it.

900
01:50:56,698 --> 01:50:58,321
Hello.

901
01:51:08,115 --> 01:51:10,106
You see to her.

902
01:51:12,323 --> 01:51:13,899
Good morning.

903
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,565
What did you want?

904
01:51:30,448 --> 01:51:32,486
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:33,573 --> 01:51:35,647
Are you all right?

906
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:42,239
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:46,279
Do you know me?

908
01:51:47,115 --> 01:51:50,943
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:55,486
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:51:57,907 --> 01:52:00,988
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:03,032 --> 01:52:05,188
You have to help me.

912
01:52:10,115 --> 01:52:11,821
Look.

913
01:52:12,532 --> 01:52:14,569
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:16,865 --> 01:52:20,941
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:21,282 --> 01:52:23,403
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:23,823 --> 01:52:26,359
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:30,821
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:32,865 --> 01:52:37,688
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:44,948 --> 01:52:47,022
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:51,652
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:04,907 --> 01:53:07,609
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:18,782 --> 01:53:21,152
I'm Vicente.
