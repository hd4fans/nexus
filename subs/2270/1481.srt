00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,890
AMC台《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously on the AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,400
我已在路上漂泊了几个月
I've been on the road for a couple of months.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,970
独自一人吗
By yourself?

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,930
是啊
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,920
你叫什么名字
You got a name?

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,310
布莱恩・赫里奥特
Brian Heriot.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,750
肯定有更安全的地方
There has to be someplace better,

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,630
你要帮我们找到
and you're gonna help us find it.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,650
来吧  梅根
Come on, Megan.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,060
该你走了  小姑娘
Your move, pumpkin.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,890
我在思考
I'm thinking.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
米奇  拿着
Mitch, grab that.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,840
上去吧
Go on.

14
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,950
你不能一直思考
You can't think forever.

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,700
你迟早得出手
Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,130
反正你也从不让我赢
You never let me win anyway.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
让了就不是赢了
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

18
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,880
我爸爸以前经常这样说
That's what my daddy used to say.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,320
他也经常下棋赢我
He used to beat me at chess, too.

20
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,950
他什么都比我好[双关]
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

21
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,640
你认识这个人吗
You know this guy?

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,700
你爸爸很刻薄吗
Was your dad mean?

23
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,940
有时候吧
Sometimes.

24
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,490
你坏吗
Were you bad?

25
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,480
有时候吧
Sometimes.

26
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,710
你一直在路上漂泊吗
So you've been on the road all this time?

27
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,890
对
Yeah.

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,050
你没事吧  布莱恩
You okay, Brian?

29
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,060
怎么了  小姑娘
What is it, pumpkin?

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,810
我坏吗
Am I bad?

31
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,320
什么
What?

32
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,690
你为什么会这样想
Why would you think that?

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,660
我爸爸总是对我很刻薄
My dad was always mean to me.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,590
你很好
Hey, you're good.

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,570
真的
You are.

36
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,070
我们的营地离这里半英里
We've got a camp about a half a mile from here.

37
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,130
绝对不行  马丁内斯
Hell, no, Martinez.

38
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,370
我们那边人已经够多了
We got too many mouths as it is.

39
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,550
看在老天的份上  他们带着个小孩
They got a kid for Christ's sake.

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,190
如果你跟我们回去
Hey, if you do come back with us,

41
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,810
就得接受两件事
there's two things you got to accept.

42
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,120
第一  我掌权
One, I'm in charge.

43
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,490
第二  不许成为累赘
Two, no deadweight.

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,550
大家都得遵守
That goes for everyone.

45
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,120
要么做出贡献  要么就被赶走
Contribute or be cast out.

46
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,910
你能接受吗
Can you live with that,

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
布莱恩
Brian?

48
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,830
你  我  你妈妈  还有塔拉姨妈
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

49
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,210
我们都会没事的
we're gonna be okay.

50
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,130
因为我们是好人吗
'Cause we're good?

51
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,390
我们都是吗
All of us?

52
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,520
该你了
Your turn.

53
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,080
布莱恩
Brian?

54
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,100
该你了
It's your turn.

55
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,970

你今天出去吗
You going out there today?

65
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,710
去找补给品
Supply run.

66
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,320
马丁内斯和杜尔根兄弟
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

67
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,950
我要在营地建立一个护士站
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station for the camp.

68
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,130
他们需要
They need one.

69
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,980
-抱歉  莉莉  这地方...  -别说了
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is-- - Stop it.

70
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,790
我想为我们找到更好的地方
I wanted something better for us.

71
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,270
这个营地不错了
This camp is good.

72
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,750
我们会让这里变得更好
We'll make it better.

73
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,630
有鱼吗
How's the fishing?

74
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,500
没鱼了  池塘水质不好
There isn't any. Pond's dead.

75
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,440
就像一潭死水
As a doornail.

76
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,300
但我们还可以抓点兔子  臭鼬
We still got rabbits, skunks,

77
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,850
负鼠什么的来吃
some possum out here.

78
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,290
你还是管好你自己吧  独眼老布
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

79
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,750
你确定我们走对方向了吗
You sure we're headed in the right direction?

80
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,570
照着霍华德的地图走的
If Howard's map is right.

81
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,110
真应该把他拖出来问个清楚
We should have dragged his ass out here to make sure.

82
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,050
人家老年人  哪里走得动
He's an old man. He can barely walk.

83
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,670
所以我才说拖着他走
That's why I said dragged.

84
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,790
希望这趟没白跑
Hope this is worth it.

85
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,250
也许他是那种末日生存主义者
Supposedly this guy was a survivalist type.

86
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,410
他的小屋里或许能找出有用的东西
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

87
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,230
说不定他还活着
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

88
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,140
我觉得危险
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

89
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,580
嘿  独眼龙  你在干嘛
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

90
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,910
这是什么
The hell is this?

91
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,970
骗子

92
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,180
看来他是把某人给惹毛了
Somebody pissed somebody off.

93
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,330
管他呢
Who gives a shit?

94
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
死了就一了百了了
That guy's got nothing to worry about anymore.

95
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,310
继续走
Let's go.

96
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,890
-这个伤口很深  -没事
- It's a deep cut. - No, that's nothing, ma'am.

97
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,670
不过是玩刀子玩过头了  很快就好了
I just got cute with my knife, that's all. I'll be fine.

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,910
那么...
So...

99
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,260
我叫艾丽西娅
Alicia.

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,310
哦对  艾丽西娅
Alicia. Right.

101
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,640
你是海军陆战队的吗
You in the Marines or something?

102
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,870
我是陆军预备役
Army. In the reserves.

103
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,170
用的M4步枪对吧
An M4, huh?

104
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,910
你有意见吗
You don't approve?

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,470
别误会
I mean, don't get me wrong,

106
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,200
用M4步枪打近战不错
an M4 is great for close combat,

107
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,670
但作为野战武器的话
but as a field weapon?

108
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,500
尘土飞扬易卡壳  还是算了吧
With all that dirt and dust, no, thanks.

109
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,860
我不太喜欢长枪
I've never really been into big guns anyway.

110
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,840
我更喜欢史密斯威森手枪
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

111
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,580
方便又好用
Less fuss, you know?

112
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,330
你尽喜欢装逼对吧
You always this full of shit?

113
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,750
没错
Yes, I am

114
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,580
强奸犯

115
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,360
凶手

116
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,930
自杀了
Took himself out.

117
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,700
你觉得是他杀了之前那些军人吗
You think he's the one who 86'd those military guys?

118
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,770
-他的头还在  -没剩多少了
- He still has his head. - Some of it, anyway.

119
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,900
进里屋看看
Let's see what he's got inside.

120
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,790
听到了吗  里面有行尸
You hear that? There's one in there.

121
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,710
肯定被卡住了出不来
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

122
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,230
要进去吗
We going in?

123
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,250
你吓尿了吗  磨蹭什么
You want us to wait till you finish pissing in your pants?

124
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,560
-不  我只是  -别废话了
- No, I'm... - Cut the chatter.

125
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,620
进去吧
Let's go.

126
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,520
-很近了  -安静
- It's close. - Quiet.

127
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,770
-它出来了  -闭嘴
- It's out. - Shut up.

128
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,590
把它从我身上弄下来
Get it off of me!

129
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,660
把它弄下来
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

130
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,730
快把它弄下来
Get it off of me!

131
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,270
皮特
Pete!

132
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
假如当时只有你一人在那个坑里
If it was just you in that pit,

133
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,040
我不会把你带进营地的
I wouldn't have brought you into the camp.

134
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,360
要不是那些和你在一起的人
If it weren't for the people you were with...

135
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,510
那个小女孩儿
the girl...

136
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,150
你感觉不太一样了
You seem different now.

137
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,210
变了
Changed.

138
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,780
是不是
Are you?

139
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,820
是的
I am.

140
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,600
那就好
Good.

141
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,080
这人有堆好东西
The guy had some good stuff.

142
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,360
罐头食品
Canned food.

143
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,920
我们有啤酒喝了
We got beer.

144
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,450
伙计  这儿发生什么了
Man, what happened here?

145
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,980
这间小屋里到底发生了什么
I mean, what the hell was going on in this cabin?

146
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,900
他养着那些行尸吗
Was he storing those biters?

147
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,730
她们是他的妻子和小孩
They were his wife and kid, man.

148
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,680
不是  它们是行尸
No, they were biters.

149
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,570
那些头又是怎么回事
What about those heads?

150
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,940
那些头的主人惹错了对象
Belonged to the guys who did the wrong thing to the wrong man.

151
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,270
我们最好还是别细想这事了
Probably best not to think too much about it.

152
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,800
你最好听独眼老布的话  皮特
Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.

153
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,250
我永远也分不清他是在使眼色还是在眨眼
I can never tell if he's winking or blinking.

154
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,930
但你知道如何控制的  是吧  老布
But you know how to regulate, don't you, Bri?

155
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,820
他一直是这样吗  马丁内斯
He was always like this, Martinez?

156
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,950
是啊  喜怒不形于色
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

157
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,730
你应该看看他当年风光的样子
You should have seen him back in the day.

158
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,730
你们大伙儿呢
What about you fellas, huh?

159
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,930
在这巨变发生前你是做什么的
What did you do before it all changed?

160
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,490
我是
I was...

161
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,350
我是个冰淇淋车司机
I was an ice cream truck driver.

162
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,710
之后我"升级"了下我的人生
Till I upgraded my life

163
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,640
成为了一个坦克驾驶员
and I became a tank operator

164
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,450
为美国陆军服务
for the US Army.

165
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,610
当一切变糟之后
Then when everything went tits up,

166
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,200
我离开了军队  把我的坦克一起带走了
I got the hell out and took my ride with me.

167
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,370
假如你有一辆坦克的话
End of the world don't mean shit

168
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,560
世界末日就不算什么屁事了
when you got a tank.

169
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,550
我也是陆军
I was Army, too.

170
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,900
驻扎在本宁堡
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

171
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,470
当这一切发生后我还在那儿待了一阵子
Stayed for a while after it all started.

172
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,210
这就是我家皮特
That's my Pete.

173
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,850
他太忠心了  不愿离开
He's too loyal to bounce.

174
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,080
你呢  布莱恩
What about you, Brian?

175
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,900
当巨变发生时你在做什么
What did you do when it all went bad?

176
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,580
生存
I survived.

177
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,820
等等  你父亲是位天主教神父吗
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

178
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,660
没错
That's right.

179
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,850
所以神父当了爹吗
So the father became a daddy?

180
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,280
的确给教堂带来了一些问题
It caused some problems with the Church a little bit.

181
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,480
这些故事布莱恩以前都听过
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

182
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,820
我们在一起待过很长时间
We spent a lot of time out there together.

183
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,040
你们在这里做得很好  我是说这个营地
You've done all right here. I mean this camp.

184
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,480
这是一切发生之后我第一次有安全感
It's the first time I've felt safe since all this started.

185
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,120
我跟布莱恩之前待的地方挺不错
The place Brian and I lived before kind of worked.

186
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,500
我想让这里也一样
I guess I wanted that again.

187
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,580
听起来你们的旧营地非常好
Sounds like your old camp was pretty sweet.

188
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,140
你们有围墙  对吗
You guys had walls, right?

189
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,580
没错  那是
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

190
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,570
那是个好地方
it was a good place.

191
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,140
这里也是个好地方  对吗
This place is good, too, right?

192
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,110
你知道的
You know it.

193
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,320
希望有一天我能听听详情
I want to hear all about it someday.

194
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,840
布莱恩一个字都不肯说
Brian won't say a word.

195
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,020
过去的事就让它过去吧
I say leave the past in the past.

196
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,800
好吧  很久以来第一次
Well, for the first time in a long time,

197
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,480
-我醉成一坨屎了  -塔拉
- I'm shitfaced. - Tara.

198
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,870
抱歉  梅根  别说那个词  好吗
Sorry. Megan, don't say that, okay?

199
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,700
-你想走了吗  -好
- You want to get out of here? - Yeah.

200
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,730
谢谢款待  尤其谢谢你们的啤酒
Thanks for the dinner. Double thanks for the suds.

201
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,730
好  再见
Yeah. Boom. There you go.

202
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,870
-注意安全  -好
- Be safe. - Yep.

203
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,110
我想  我想我也该走了
I think, um-- I think I'm gonna go.

204
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,460
你确定吗  我还有不少臭啤酒呢
You sure? I got a couple of skunky beers left.

205
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,040
我没事  谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

206
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,670
布莱恩  屋顶又漏了
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

207
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,690
你去修修吧  伙计
You should fix that, man.

208
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,640
我会的
I'll do that.

209
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,770
等一会儿  小娃娃
Later, muneca.

210
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,120
差点忘了  有个惊喜给你
Almost forgot. Got a surprise for you.

211
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,720
我靠
Aw, damn it.

212
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,770
再给我递一个
Hand me another one.

213
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,350
你知道他死了  对吗
You know he's dead, right?

214
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,950
香珀特
Shumpert?

215
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,920
伍德伯里之后他就不一样了
He was never the same after Woodbury.

216
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,730
他变得很鲁莽
Yeah. He got reckless.

217
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,380
行尸在那边咬掉了他一块肉
Biter took a piece of him right over there.

218
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,420
我发誓  他都没想要躲开
I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.

219
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,440
我亲手放倒了他
I put him down myself.

220
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,160
就在那边
Right over there.

221
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,060
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

222
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,130
有些事情你永远无法回头
There's some things you just can't come back from.

223
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,530
它们变成了你的一部分
They become a part of who you are.

224
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,230
不管你是否能够接受
Either you live with them or you don't.

225
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,660
看起来你接受的挺好
Well, you seem to be living with them pretty well.

226
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,940
你也一样
So are you.

227
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,300
那家人  他们把你带了回来
That family, they brought you back.

228
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,980
你很幸运  我不能
You're lucky. I couldn't--

229
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,510
我不能再那么做了  不能冒那个险
I couldn't do that again. Couldn't risk it.

230
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,020
想到可能失去他们  我就无法在夜里安眠
Couldn't sleep at night knowing I was gonna lose them.

231
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,320
我不会失去她们的
I'm not gonna lose them.

232
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,080
是啊
Yeah.

233
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,440
你不认为你能保护营地的安全吗
What, you don't think you can keep this place safe?

234
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,240
我会尽力
I'll try.

235
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,900
希望我们能尽量做好准备
Hopefully we'll be prepared for whatever comes.

236
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,390
现在你来了
Now you're here,

237
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,160
也许我们可以一起干
maybe we can share the crown a little.

238
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,100
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

239
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,000
早知道我就去学学高尔夫
I should have taken some golf lessons before the-

240
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,100
我不想这么做
I don't wanna do it!

241
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,360
我不想  我不想
I don't want it! I don't want it!

242
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,010
听见了吗  我也不想  该死的
You hear me? I don't want it, damn it!

243
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,420
我也不想
I don't want it.

244
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,710
我也不想
I don't want it.

245
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,530
布莱恩  我们回来了
Brian, we're home!

246
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,560
梅根  他睡觉呢
Megan, he's sleeping.

247
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,210
布莱恩
Brian?

248
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,460
你在发抖
You're shaking.

249
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,090
怎么了
What is it?

250
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,950
做了个噩梦  没什么
I just had a bad dream, that's all.

251
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,500
什么样的噩梦
What was it?

252
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,720
我不记得了
I can't remember.

253
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,040
大家听着
Listen up!

254
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,200
今天早上  我们在一个坑里
We found what was left of Martinez

255
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,410
找到了马丁内斯的残骸
in a pit this morning.

256
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,170
貌似他当时在打高尔夫
Looks like he was hitting some golf balls,

257
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,720
他喝多了
he got drunk,

258
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,110
然后掉进了坑里
he fell in.

259
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,260
那现在怎么办
So now what?

260
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,120
我将继任营地首领
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

261
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,230
-不  不  -等一下  都等等
- No. No. - Hold on now. Hold on now!

262
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,420
我们应该投票才对
We should vote on who leads, right?

263
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,180
-是啊  -你没权利就这么接任
- Yeah. - You can't just take over.

264
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,640
-闭嘴  婊子  -你说什么
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch. - What?

265
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,940
冷静
Hey, calm down!

266
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,840
大家都冷静
Calm down, all of you.

267
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,430
我们现在
We need each other

268
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,340
更需要团结一致
now more than ever.

269
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,980
能熬过这一切  所有这一切的唯一办法
The only way we get through this, through any of this,

270
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,270
就是团结一致
is together.

271
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,290
现在的安排是暂时的
Now this is temporary.

272
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,850
未来几天内我们会想办法选举
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote in the next couple of days.

273
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,170
但现在  一切照旧
For now, it's business as usual.

274
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,520
行吗
Okay?

275
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
你们听见他说的了
You heard the man.

276
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,680
解散
Move!

277
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,700
拜托
Please?

278
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,910
做好准备  我们去找补给
Gear up. We're going on a hunt.

279
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,450
定量配给  修护栏  药品储备
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

280
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,360
有无数个问题而人们期望我给出答案
There are 100 questions and people are looking to me for answers.

281
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,270
当领袖是很难
Well, it's hard to lead.

282
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,560
是啊  我需要点协助
Yeah, I could use some help.

283
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,940
有多少人
How many?

284
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,300
10个
10.

285
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,560
可能不到
Maybe less.

286
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,490
但他们供给很足
They got a lot of supplies, though.

287
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,300
也许我们该把他们吸收进来
Maybe we should take 'em in.

288
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,500
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

289
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,420
我们的供给只是勉强够分
We barely got enough to go around as it is.

290
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,170
听着  皮特  我知道你不想伤害任何人
Look, Pete, I know you don't want to hurt nobody.

291
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,860
我也不想  但我们需要那些供给
Neither do I, but we need those supplies.

292
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,600
我们直接过去
Now let's just go over there

293
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,950
拿到需要的东西  就回家
and take what we need and go home.

294
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,050
绝不采取暴力
No rough stuff.

295
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,150
-你想抢劫他们  -何不呢
- You want to rob 'em? - Why not?

296
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,760
我们需要他们的补给
We need their stuff.

297
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,500
-他们有枪  但如果我们动作快点  -不
- They got guns, but if we roll up on 'em quick--  - No.

298
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,900
不行  我们自己也能找到供给
No, we can find our own supplies.

299
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,020
走吧 
Come on.

300
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,160
太搞笑了
What a joke.

301
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,340
我们干得挺好的
We did all right.

302
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,430
是啊  几只该死的松鼠  几罐炼乳
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels, some condensed milk.

303
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,690
你还要我怎么样  我在努力呢
What do you want from me? I'm trying here.

304
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,230
你去哪儿
Where you going?

305
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,460
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

306
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,350
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

307
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,970
这不是行尸干的
This wasn't biters.

308
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,110
是人干的
People did this.

309
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,740
肯定是刚发生的
Must have just happened.

310
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,700
我们本来可以拿到供给的
We would have had those supplies.

311
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,890
你在担心供给吗
You're worried about supplies?

312
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,890
这些人已经死了  米奇
These people are dead, Mitch.

313
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,350
你说得太对了  他们死了
You're damn right they're dead!

314
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
反正他们都是个死
That was gonna happen either way.

315
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,680
现在倒让别人抢走了咱们的供给
Now some other group's got our stuff.

316
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,000
米奇  米奇  不
Mitch. Mitch, no!

317
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,880
他可能还活着
He might have lived.

318
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,920
可能吧
Might have.

319
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,700
需要这个吗
Need this?

320
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,530
布莱恩  出什么事了
Brian, what's going on?

321
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,450
-马上收拾你的东西  -怎么啦
- Pack your things, now. - What's happening?

322
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,420
等等  宝贝
Hold on, baby.

323
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,780
拿上你的衣服  带点吃的  快点
Grab your clothes, pack some food. Come on.

324
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,280
妈妈
Mommy?

325
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,450
-布莱恩  住手  -去找塔拉
- Brian, stop. - Get Tara.

326
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,700
我们得走了  这里不再安全了
We need to leave. It isn't safe here anymore.

327
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,880
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

328
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,100
我们不能就这么走人
We can't just run off.

329
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,330
我是营地里唯一的护士  塔拉跟艾丽西娅在一起
I'm the only nurse in camp. Tara's got Alicia.

330
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,820
那梅根怎么办
What about Megan?

331
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,240
听着  这里就要出大事了
Look, things are about to go very wrong here.

332
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,430
我以前遇到过  不能再让你和梅根遭罪
It's happened to me before. I can't put you and Megan through that.

333
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,980
不能再失去你们了
Can't lose you again.

334
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,740
那皮特怎么办
What about Pete?

335
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,390
你说过他是个好人
You said he was a good man.

336
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,210
-我错了  -但是...
- Well, I was wrong. - But...

337
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,850
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

338
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,350
你相信我吗  莉莉
Do you trust me, Lily?

339
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,450
那就快收拾东西
Then pack your things.

340
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,950
我们今晚就走
We're leaving tonight, okay?

341
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,380
快点
Come on.

342
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,620
妈妈
Mommy.

343
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,270
妈妈
Mommy.

344
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,710
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

345
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,890
-艾丽西娅  -你应该开慢点
- Alicia. - Maybe you should slow down.

346
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,140
不行  我不明白  我不懂
No, I don't understand this. I don't understand this.

347
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,990
不管去哪里我们都在一起  好吗
Hey, we're together, okay?

348
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,700
我们在营地里什么都有  有食物有住所
We have everything back there. We have food, we have shelter.

349
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,400
-布莱恩  -天呐
- Brian. - Oh, my god.

350
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,170
待在车里
Just stay in the car.

351
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,910
你在做什么
What are you doing?

352
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,060
生存
Surviving.

353
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,020
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

354
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,260
米奇的事情
About Mitch.

355
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,310
进来吧
Come in.

356
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,220
我就知道会这样
I knew this was coming.

357
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,090
我总是得帮他擦屁股
I've been getting him out of trouble my--

358
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,790
皮特呢
Where's Pete?

359
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,740
他死了
He's dead.

360
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,240
现在你也要把我干掉吗
You gonna kill me, too, now?

361
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,460
因为我杀了营地里那个老家伙吗
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

362
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,850
抽烟吗
Smoke?

363
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,950
你对我哥哥做了什么
Why did you do my brother?

364
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,160
关于那个营地  你说得对
You were right about that camp.

365
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,370
我们应该把他们的补给抢回来
We should have taken their supplies.

366
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,470
我不在乎你杀了那个老头
I don't care that you killed the old man.

367
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,850
像你哥哥那种人  总是坚持做对的事情
Men like your brother, always doing the right thing,

368
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,260
甚至以自己人为代价
even at the cost of their own people.

369
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,820
抽根烟吧
Go on. Have a cigarette.

370
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,130
我戒了
I quit.

371
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,620
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

372
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,220
我还记得我抽的第一根烟
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

373
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,540
我和我哥挤在车库里
Me and my brother huddled in the garage

374
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,570
吸着我爸的好彩烟
puffing on one of my dad's lucky strikes.

375
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,100
他肯定是闻到了烟味  接着就冲了进来
He must have smelled the smoke, because he came barging in,

376
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,150
想揍我们
looking to beat up on us.

377
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,670
但是我哥哥挡在我前面
But my brother got between us.

378
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,030
说是他偷的
Said he stole them.

379
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,360
根本不是  是我偷的
Wasn't true. It was me.

380
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,870
但我哥哥就是那种人
But that was my brother.

381
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,340
英雄
Hero.

382
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,910
他因此被揍得鼻青脸肿  肋骨断了一根
He got two black eyes and a broken rib for that.

383
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,640
我也挨了打
And I got beat anyway.

384
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,410
拿一根吧
Take one.

385
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,940
现在我接管了
I'm running things now,

386
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,160
我会尽我所能保护这个营地
and I will do everything it takes to protect this camp.

387
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,980
如果你加入我  我保证
Now, if you join me, I promise you

388
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,840
你以后再也不用担心自己的行为
you will never have to worry about whether you were doing

389
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,100
是对还是错
the right thing or the wrong thing.

390
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,130
因为为了营地
Because we will do

391
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,730
我们会做任何事
the only thing.

392
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,120
皮特的事我们怎么对营地的人说
What are we gonna tell the camp about Pete?

393
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,390
我们就说他在寻找补给时
We'll tell them he died on a supply run

394
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,100
为救我们而死
saving our asses.

395
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,230
你觉得人们会相信吗
You think they're really gonna believe that?

396
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,300
人们相信自己想相信的事
People believe what they want to believe.

397
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,230
人人都爱英雄
Everybody loves a hero.

398
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,490
外围防护如何了
How's the perimeter coming?

399
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,040
挺好的  我们用车围起了整个营地
It's good. We got cars ringing almost the entire camp.

400
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,150
再去找点东西
I think a few more runs,

401
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,600
就能建起一个缓冲带了
we should have ourselves a nice little buffer.

402
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,750
尸坑呢
And the pits?

403
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,820
行尸不断来  我们不断烧
They keep coming, we keep burning them.

404
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,100
不知道是不是因为太热了
I don't know if it's the heat or what,

405
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,090
最近它们变得非常多
but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately.

406
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,760
-弹药呢  -充足
- And the armory? - solid.

407
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,900
我收集了营地的所有子弹
I rounded up all the ammo in camp.

408
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,950
我们的子弹都堆满了
We're officially stocked in the bullet department.

409
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,830
但还是告诉你的队员
Still, tell your crews

410
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,430
以后外出搜索只准用弓箭
supply runs are arrow only from now on.

411
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,150
子弹这年头很珍贵
Gunshots are a luxury.

412
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,660
留着它们迟早用的上
Sooner or later we're gonna need 'em.

413
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,210
对  不只是对付行尸
That's right, and not just for the biters.

414
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,180
米奇  我  还有皮特
Mitch and I and Pete,

415
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,310
我们见识过外面的人有多危险
we saw what people can do out there.

416
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,180
如果碰到陌生人  就避开他们
You come across strangers, you just avoid them.

417
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,530
回来告诉我们你在哪里看到了他们  好吗
Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay?

418
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,820
走吧
Let's go.

419
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,940
也许我们能找到更好的地方
Maybe we can find a better place.

420
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,060
你知道  如果
You know, if...

421
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,100
我们愿意去争取的话
we're willing to fight for it.

422
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,230
我们不用去找更好的地方
We don't need to find a better place.

423
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,610
这里就是家
This is home.

424
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,840
你是鬼  塔拉姨妈
You're it, Aunt Tara.

425
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,110
什么  我不能当鬼  我在放哨
What? I can't be it. I'm on guard duty.

426
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,800
我是个负责任的成年人
I have to be a responsible adult.

427
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,740
-你是鬼  -快去追她
- You're it. - Go get her.

428
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,460
-这不公平  -快跑  梅根
- No fair! - Run, Megan.

429
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,460
你不必独自承担
You don't have to do this alone.

430
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,910
抓到你了
Caught you.

431
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,310
塔拉姨妈
Aunt Tara!

432
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,010
梅根
Megan!

433
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,310
塔拉姨妈  不
Aunt Tara! No!

434
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,250
-妈妈  -梅根
- Mommy! - Megan!

435
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,050
没事了  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

436
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,170
没事的
It's okay.

437
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,700
现代汽车为您带来《行尸走肉》下集预告
Hyundai presents scenes from the next episode of The Walking Dead...

438
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,920
他们有高墙  栅栏  非常安全
They've got walls, fences, peace of mind.

439
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,610
如果我们愿意的话
There's nothing between us and them

440
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,740
季中大结局

441
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,310
可以轻易夺下那里
if we're willing to take it from them.

442
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,790
我们不会离开
We are not leaving.

443
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,460
我现在就可以做个了结
I can end this right now.

444
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,470
两方相争

445
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,700
必有死伤

446
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,710
