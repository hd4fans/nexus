{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}当年他从武甫人那里逃出\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}He was fleeing the Wulfings

200
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,040
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}空手将他们的一个族人杀死\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}and he'd killed one of them with his bare hands.

201
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,050
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}- 西索拉夫\N- 就是他，没错\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}- Heatholaf. - That's it, yeah. That's right.

202
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,920
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我替你父亲偿还了血债（用财产）\N于是他宣誓效忠于我\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I paid the blood debt for your father, and he swore his oath to me.

203
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,050
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我救了他一命，所以你把我们拯救\N是这样吧？\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}So I saved his skin, and you're here to save ours, that right?

204
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,870
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}荣耀属于伟大的贝奥武甫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}All hail the great Beowulf,

205
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,640
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}来把我们丹麦人可怜的小命拯救，啊？\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}come to save our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

206
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,780
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我们至死感激不尽，强大的贝奥武甫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}And we are so damned grateful, mighty Beowulf.

207
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,790
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}但有一问题不知该不该问\N秉着对你狂热的仰慕\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}But can I ask a question, as a huge admirer of yours?

208
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,400
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我听说有另一位贝奥武甫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}There was another Beowulf I heard tell of

209
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,440
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}挑战无敌的布勒卡，在深海里赛泳\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}who challenged Brecca the Mighty to a swimming race out on the open sea.

210
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,640
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}那人可是你？\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Was that you?

211
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,900
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我是和布勒卡赛泳\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I swam against Brecca.

212
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,180
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我以为那定是另一位贝奥武甫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Because I thought it had to be a different Beowulf,

213
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,150
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}另外一人，却有相同的名字\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}someone else of the same name.

214
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,630
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}因为，我听说的这位贝奥武甫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Because, you see, the Beowulf I heard of

215
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,360
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}与布勒卡赛泳，输了\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}swam against Brecca and lost.

216
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,260
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}此人用自己和布勒卡的生命做筹码\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}He risked his life and Brecca's

217
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,770
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}来满足自己的虚荣和傲慢\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}to serve his own vanity and pride.

218
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,340
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}一位自负的愚人\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}A boastful fool.

219
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,310
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}最后却输了\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}And he lost!

220
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,240
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}所以，我想那定是他人\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}So I thought it had to be someone else.

221
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,060
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我是和布勒卡赛泳\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I swam against Brecca.

222
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,120
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}但胜利属于他，不属于你\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}But victory was his, not yours.

223
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,330
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}一位无敌的战士，却无法赢得赛泳\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}A mighty warrior who cannot even win a swimming match!

224
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,130
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}且说我自己的想法\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Speaking only for myself here,

225
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,000
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我不仅质疑你能否有一个片刻\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}not only do I doubt that you will be able to stand for a moment

226
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,700
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}抵挡住哥伦德\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}against Grendel,

227
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,010
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我质疑你是否有勇气在这大殿度过一夜\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I doubt that you will even have the belly to stay in the hall all night.

228
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,750
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}与醉人争辩是最难不过\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

229
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,960
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}但你说的乃是事实，我没有赢得比赛\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}But it's true, I did not win the race.

230
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,400
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我们游过了五个昼夜，颈并着颈\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}We swam for five days, neck and neck.

231
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,500
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我保藏着力量，为最后的冲刺\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I was conserving my strength for the final stretch

232
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,580
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}风暴突然地吹起\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}when this storm blew up

233
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,440
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}带来了海中的怪兽\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}and with it came sea monsters.

234
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,060
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}一次又一次，海怪接连袭来\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Again and again, the monsters attacked!

235
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,730
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}黑暗的事物，来自大海的深处\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Dark things from the sea's depths.

236
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,110
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我拿起宝剑\N砍向这些污秽的怪兽，刺进他们的身体\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I hacked and I lashed at these foul beasts with my sword,

237
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,780
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}它们剖开的肚肠，洒进大海\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}spilling their guts into the sea.

238
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,890
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}贝奥武甫!\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Beowulf!

239
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,370
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}然后，其中一只把我咬住\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Then one of them seized me by its jaws

240
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,280
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}拖我到了海底\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}and dragged me to the bottom.

241
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,250
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}被我用我的剑杀死\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I killed the monster with my own blade

242
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,640
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}直插进心脏\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}and I plunged it into its heart.

243

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}是的，海上的怪兽\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}上次说的是三只\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Last time it were three.

247
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,300
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}那么，你能告知，你的姓名\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}But would you do me the honor of telling me your name?

248
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,070
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我是俄戈拉夫之子，安浮斯\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}他们说你把你的两个兄弟杀死\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}They say you killed both your brothers

252
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,060
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}因为你撞见他们与你母亲私通\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}when you witnessed them having knowledge of your mother.

253
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,600
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}我还要告诉你另一个事实，弑亲的安浮斯\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}I have another true thing to tell you, Unferth Kinslayer.

254

255

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}几乎把性命赔上\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Nearly cost me my life.

282

283
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,890
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}看到吗？要用刀或匕首直插进去\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}See? You have to go in with a knife or a dagger.

284
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,570

285

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}那不过是狼\N没有任何声音预示哥伦德的到来\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}That was a wolf. You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

293

{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}欺骗已经太迟了，维格拉夫\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\b0}Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:56,770
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}注释

856
01:45:57,670 --> 01:46:09,670
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}原诗写成于公元八世纪左右\N作者和后来的抄写修订者是基督信徒\N而所记叙的北欧世界则信仰英雄崇拜\N和北欧众神（如片中的奥丁神）

857
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:19,070
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}所以片中出现了两种信仰的交叉对立\N贝奥武甫等代表英雄，众神信仰\N安浮斯和晚年的王后等代表基督教信仰

858
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:36,070
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}原诗中，哥伦德一族是该隐的后代\N该隐是圣经中亚当夏娃之子\N因弑兄（原罪）被上帝驱逐\N受罚永生游荡（即“命定的地方”）\N众多罪恶均从该隐而起\N（片中安浮斯曾弑兄，他的奴隶叫该隐）

859
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:46,070
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}片中，歌伦德之母是龙或蛇一族\N原诗中龙贪婪护财，终生守护财宝\N只因财宝被盗，便残杀人类报复

860
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:56,070
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}而片中哥伦德之母为得到金龙角\N引诱王者洛斯戈和贝奥武甫（维格拉夫）\N生下了哥伦德和火龙

861
01:46:56,070 --> 01:47:04,970
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}所以洛斯戈说哥伦德是他的诅咒\N而安浮斯说的“父辈的罪孽”即指\N作为父亲的该隐，洛斯戈，贝奥武夫的罪孽

862
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:12,970
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}原诗中哥伦德袭击人类是因为\N他忍受不了人类的欢乐\N未听懂的哥伦德话大意也应是如此

863
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:17,970
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}贝奥武甫的名字的含义有多种推测\N片中用的是《指环王》作者托尔金的解释

864
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:25,970
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}Beowulf=Bee（蜜蜂）+Wolf（狼，猎手）\N吃蜜蜂的狼，即指熊\N形容贝奥武夫的勇猛强壮

865
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:30,970
{\fn黑体\fs14\b2}谢谢欣赏
