1
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,019
It's cold.
Where should we go?

2
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,409
Anywhere, just make it quick.

3
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
It's ready.

4
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,060
Over here!

5
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,819
It's over here.

6
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,000
Someone must've fallen
from the roof.

7
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,289
Suicide?

8
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,990
I don't know.

9
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,409
Let's go check it out.

10
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,069
Someone died
and you wanna wa'tch?

11
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,080
Let's go see it later.

12
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,560
Excuse me.

13
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,639
What are you doing?

14
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,840
Hurry up.

15
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,589
Do you know where
Lee Eun-yi lives?

16
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,079
Forgive me for entering
your home without permission.

17
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,069
But I need to be careful
about new hires.

18
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,439
I checked your resume
and references and so on.

19
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,019
But I wanted to see for myself
how you lived.

20
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:55,959
Please don't misunderstand.

21
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,930
Not much of a talker, are you?

22
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,850
I heard you have
a small apartment in Pyung-taek?

23
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,800
Yes, I had to rent it out.

24
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,529
You went over everything
with Mrs. Cho?

25
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,799
You're here
on her recommendation.

26
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,879
We appreciate your help.

27
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,529
No, ma'am.
Thank you.

28
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,340
It's huge, isn't it?

29
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,429
It is quite large.

30
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,789
It's because there are
two of them in there.

31
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,629
You didn't tell her?

32
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,970
Mrs. Cho...

33
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,159
I told you not to do that again.

34
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,419
Oh, twins are no problem.

35
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,080
I'll work out
the terms again, ma'am.

36
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,519
Should fit you perfectly.

37
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,799
Don't let them see you
in anything else.

38
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,110
It's nice, but...

39
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,750
I never wore anything like this
at work before.

40
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,919
Madam's underwear
is in her bathroom

41
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,340
you should hand wash it.

42
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,059
When you get that big,
you pee just by sneezing.

43
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,690
Look in the laundry basket,
please.

44
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,049
You're Nami, right?
I'm the new nanny, Eun-yi.

45
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,279
I told you
a new maid was coming today.

46
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,309
I know.

47
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,299
Aren't you going to go
greet your mother?

48
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,340
After I change
and wash my hands.

49
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,879
I can do it myself.

50
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,570
- Then call me if you need me.
- Okay.

51
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,590
- Should I close the door?
- Yes, please.

52
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,629
Do you like the new maid?

53
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,039
She likes me a lot.

54
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,679
- Did she say that?
- No.

55
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,529
Then how do you know?

56
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,730
I can see it in her face.

57
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,070
It's all going to be
thrown out.

58
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,100
We might as well eat it.

59
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,139
Are you insane?

60
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,659
I'm sorry.

61
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,080
He's here.

62
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,049
She's new, sir.
She'll be here for a while.

63
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,809
This is Lee Eun-yi,
she took care of

64
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,450
Hyun's baby brother for 3 years.

65
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,600
She's divorced and living alone.

66
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,169
Ah, do you have any children?

67
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,629
Have a seat, please.

68
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,730
Go tell Mom
there's no need to come down.

69
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,230
I'll be right up.

70
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,720
Okay.

71
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,899
I'm Goh Hoon.
Nami's father.

72
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,120
Lee Eun-yi, sir.

73
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,950
I don't have anything to say
in particular.

74
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,090
But you'll be raising my kids...

75
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,600
and cooking the food I'll eat.

76
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,399
You're an important person.
I should greet you properly.

77
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,269
Madam?

78
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,409
Would you send up
a bottle of red wine?

79
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:51,759
He calls you madam?

80
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,230
Sometimes.
When he feels like it.

81
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:17,389
Take it up to him.

82
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,580
Were you grouchy
all day again?

83
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,600
I can't even breathe.
And my stomach's so itchy.

84
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,549
You exercise too much.

85
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,529
I need to be healthy
for a natural delivery.

86
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,429
You know, the doctors say
that won't be easy.

87
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,539
Of course they say that.
A C-section is easier for them.

88
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,210
They'll do as I tell them.
You sure you can handle it?

89
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,470
Of course.
I'm the mom.

90
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,039
Ms. Lee used to be an
early childhood education major.

91
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:19,029
What does that have to do
with actually raising kids?

92
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,159
I guess.
She seems kind of childlike.

93
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,120
That's good.
She'll get along with the kids.

94
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,269
Eun-yi?

95
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,379
Yes?

96
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,019
You're still awake?

97
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,980
Can you leave the door
open a little?

98
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,430
This much?

99
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,099
More please.

100
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,099
Thank you.

101
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:00,809
Who's playing?

102
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,210
Black pepper.

103
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,609
Two times.

104
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,690
Take it.

105
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,019
The Beethoven sounded nice.

106
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:51,259
Bye.

107
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,059
- Breakfast, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

108
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,730
Me, too.
Breakfast, please.

109
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,190
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:26,089
That's too hot.

111
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,940
I think Mr. Goh is back, ma'am.

112
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,460
I should clean the washroom.

113
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,730
My fingernails tomorrow, please.

114
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,579
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,289
Try it.

116
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,529
If you want more,
stop by my father's house.

117
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,519
Drink, it's good.

118
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,869
Much better!

119
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,599
You brought your swimsuit,
right?

120
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
Gotcha!

121
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,940
You're a good swimmer.

122
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,519
You're floating!

123
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Up you go.

124
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,119
It's so cold...

125
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,609
Mmm, hot water!

126
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:30,240
You know why I'm not getting
a C-section, baby?

127
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,569
I'm going to have
4 or 5 children.

128
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,009
I don't get why your brother's
wife stopped after two kids.

129
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:01,779
That's for common people who
have to struggle to raise them.

130
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,369
Not so deep.

131
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,650
I think we should stop.

132
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,140
What a shame...

133
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,269
I'll use my mouth.

134
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:44,900
Is that you, Nami?

135
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,559
Come on down.

136
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,839
Drink up.

137
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,140
Let me see.

138
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,940
Pull off the blanket.

139
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,420
God, I love this smell.

140
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,990
Suck it.

141
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,869
"The Second Sex"

142
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,599
That'll be all.

143
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,470
Ms. Lee?

144
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,190
Thank you.

145
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,380
Bye, honey.

146
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,119
Not so hard.

147
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:47,009
Your eyes seem so desperate
to find your baby.

148
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:52,019
Your eyes, pure like diamonds
and sharp like sapphire.

149
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,579
Now, shed your tears
into the lake.

150
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:59,150
I will take only your eyes.

151
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,049
Then I will bring you

152
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:04,420
to the other side of the lake
to your baby.

153
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,490
The young mother sighs
in desperation.

154
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,279
If I can only save my baby
from death...

155
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,079
Of course
I will give you my eyes.

156
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:19,259
The mother starts
shedding tears into the lake.

157
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:25,859
Look at the picture.

158
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,700
I love how
you're such a nice girl.

159
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,569
You're not bad-tempered,
you're polite to me.

160
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,710
I learned that from Father.

161
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:46,779
He said
to treat people politely.

162
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,069
It may seem like
a sign of respect,

163
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:52,240
but it's really
putting myself first.

164
00:33:58,849 --> 00:33:59,869
You're lucky to have a father

165
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,509
who teaches you things
like that.

166
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,579
Open the door wide tonight,
please.

167
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,710
Yes, Miss.

168
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,119
It's so late.
You don't have to do that.

169
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,320
Congratulations on your son.

170
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,820
Thank you, sir.

171
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,940
You must be tired.

172
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,369
I'm fine, sir.

173
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:00,599
I'm going to cum.

174
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,960
Can I do it inside you?

175
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,280
Please don't.

176
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,539
Then let me cum in your mouth.

177
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,300
Yes!

178
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,340
Not now.
Suck it hard when I put it in.

179
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,750
What?

180
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,110
Suck it like a straw.

181
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,420
I'll try.

182
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,730
I'm so scared.

183
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,929
What are you scared of?

184
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:58,869
I'm terrified.

185
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,599
Now, in your mouth!

186
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,449
- Where is it?
- Here!

187
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,480
Take it.

188
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:32,059
You!

189
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,269
Let's eat.

190
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:54,889
Wow.

191
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,710
They're kicking hard.

192
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,250
You're impatient to come out?

193
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,360
You two are so lively!

194
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,340
They're moving around.

195
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,170
You get up in the morning

196
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,860
and think of
what you have to endure...

197
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,679
...and damn
it makes your gut hurt.

198
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,039
But what can you do?

199
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,949
Just breathe in deep,
and transform into a cold stone.

200
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,110
Sorry I can't be warmer to you.

201
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:17,889
This job is R.U.N.S.

202
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,250
What?

203
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:23,849
Revolting, ugly,
nauseating, and shameless.

204
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,469
I wasted my whole life
in this place.

205
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:35,559
How long do you plan to do this?

206
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,619
I like this job.

207
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,519
You got a man?
You're still in good shape.

208
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,329
Aren't I?
I still got it, huh?

209
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,449
Are you dating or not?

210
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:00,019
Out there
the world's full of men.

211
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,400
But no one's
really worth my time.

212
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:12,300
That's true.

213
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:36,309
She used to eat
the stinkiest kimchi...

214
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,840
But now she won't even touch it.

215
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,699
She can't keep her food down.

216
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,860
And her breasts seem swollen.

217
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,099
I know how sharp you are.

218
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:51,460
So I asked her off guard,
but she doesn't have a man.

219
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,400
I'm pretty sure of it, ma'am.

220
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,300
So she doesn't even realize
she's pregnant yet?

221
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:01,849
Well, she's kind of
on the slow side...

222
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,699
Slow?

223
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,469
Really?

224
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,539
What do you think she'll do
when she finds out?

225
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:13,380
Slow, or naive...

226
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,960
She's not completely stupid,
but she won't pull any tricks.

227
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,820
She's pure-hearted.

228
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,710
Like Dostoyevsky's Idiot?

229
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,880
Your daughter got mad at me
for coming here.

230
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,139
Like she can do anything
without me.

231
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:41,800
I heard your son
got appointed to prosecutor.

232
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,219
Truly amazing, huh?

233
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,199
Thank you.
It's all thanks to you.

234
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:51,190
What do you mean?

235
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,079
It's a personal triumph for you.

236
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,010
A personal triumph.

237
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,329
Your boss came in naked
and you didn't even resist?

238
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:05,460
I was naked, too
and waiting for him!.

239
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:09,599
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,010
So, is it any different
with a rich man?

241
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,809
He finished with that.

242
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:25,889
Guess it is different.

243
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,079
Are you going to keep
working in that house?

244
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,190
Yes.

245
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,449
Isn't it uncomfortable
being around his wife?

246
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,289
It's like
nothing really happened.

247
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,449
But it did happen.
You can't change that.

248
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,219
Bye, Mom.

249
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,210
I won't be coming anymore.

250
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:33,219
Why call in someone else
to do the cleaning?

251
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:35,909
Just have her do it bit by bit.

252
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,219
She won't be too busy
until the twins are born.

253
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:41,030
That damn thing!

254
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,980
My god, Mom!

255
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,320
Stay calm, don't panic.

256
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:51,449
Mom, do something!

257
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:52,590
Don't move!

258
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:54,789
Ma'am?
Please grab my leg.

259
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,159
Grandma! Hurry!

260
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,150
Nami, you stay still.

261
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,900
Mom!
Are you crazy?

262
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:21,110
Shut up
if you don't know anything.

263
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,059
She just has
a slight concussion.

264
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,030
But she feels pain in her pelvis
so we'll do some tests.

265
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,900
She fell
from the second floor?

266
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,300
She's very lucky.

267
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,949
Your husband's fucking her,
and she's pregnant.

268
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:47,889
That's a fact.

269
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,130
The possibility that the baby's
not your husband's?

270
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,880
Zero.

271
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,579
So you pulled that shit
in front of Nami?

272
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,420
I can't believe you.

273
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,420
What shit?

274
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:05,670
That was just an accident.

275
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,670
Yes?

276
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:20,170
She has a concussion
bruised pelvis,

277
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,340
and some abrasions.

278
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,679
They're all pretty minor.

279
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,809
She just needs
a couple days rest.

280
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,639
That's not
what I want to know.

281
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:34,099
The doctor
didn't mention that.

282
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,900
And she didn't
discharge any blood.

283
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:38,539
Tough as a weed, that girl...

284
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:39,960
The doctors did all that testing

285
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,730
and didn't find out
she's pregnant?

286
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,159
It's still too early to tell,
ma'am.

287
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,869
You sure you didn't
make a mistake?

288
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:52,940
Fine! Calm her down
and come back.

289
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,980
I heard Hoon's going abroad
on business.

290
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,900
Just hold on for tonight.

291
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,050
I'll take care of everything
before he gets back.

292
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,590
Mother, I want to be alone.

293
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:18,059
With a rich husband, cheating
is just part of the package.

294
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,349
Hae-ra's mother says
she's really sorry.

295
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:07,400
She says to rest up
and not worry about anything.

296
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,050
It must've been heavy.

297
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:17,039
Your consolation payment.

298
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,650
You know this is how that family
solves any problems, right?

299
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,780
Convenient for them.
And not bad for us either.

300
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,880
Get some rest.

301
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:11,980
Mrs. Cho!

302
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,750
Do you still see me

303
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,980
as that helpless little
high school girl?

304
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,590
Of course not, ma'am.

305
00:53:30,789 --> 00:53:32,250
In that case

306
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:34,360
how dare you gossip
about my husband

307
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:38,760
behind my back to outsiders?

308
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,460
Outsiders?
How am I an outsider?

309
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:43,980
Mom!

310
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,920
My deepest apologies, ma'am.

311
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,340
It won't happen again.

312
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,050
Hello, Mother.

313
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,860
Hi.

314
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,440
- Hae-ra is edgy.
- These days she always is.

315
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,219
I don't see
the young maid today.

316
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,940
I sent her to the hospital.
She's not feeling well, sir.

317
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,480
This late?

318
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,940
They admitted her
for the night.

319
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,789
Oh, really?

320
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:31,230
She'll be back tomorrow, sir.

321
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,280
Mrs. Cho?

322
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,510
Why are you chattering on
this late at night?

323
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:40,489
With that annoying
voice of yours.

324
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:46,179
And why does it take you hours
to pack a suitcase?

325
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:49,389
Is it because you're old?

326
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,050
I am the mother...

327
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,170
...of a prosecutor
of the Republic of Korea!

328
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:10,420
Revolting, ugly,
nauseating, and shameless!

329
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:17,760
R.U.N.S.

330
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:19,909
R.U.N.S.

331
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,849
R.U.N.S!

332
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,630
- Here's Ms. Lee Eun-yi.
- Thank you.

333
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:37,159
We didn't notice it at first.

334
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,280
See this?

335
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,570
The fertilized egg
implanted in your womb?

336
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,530
You're pregnant.
Looks like about four weeks.

337
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,070
It's a blessing to be pregnant.

338
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,519
Be brave.

339
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:01,670
Was it your boss?

340
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,630
You'll spend all your savings
giving birth

341
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:08,269
and raising the baby.

342
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,210
But I guess savings are meant
to be spent in times like this.

343
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:16,460
Maybe there's some sort of
government support?

344
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,300
Is it your boss' baby?

345
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,469
I mean, he's rich and all.

346
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,570
Have you ever had an abortion?

347
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:37,139
You should pack up
and get out of that house now.

348
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,389
Abortion or not.

349
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,010
Then what?

350
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:45,840
Then what?
You can think about that later.

351
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,289
Your baby's not going anywhere.

352
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,440
Thank you.

353
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,289
There are obstetrics tests
listed on the hospital bill.

354
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:03,019
Now she knows she's pregnant.

355
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:09,059
Let's see what that bimbo
tries to pull.

356
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,070
What did he see
in that cheap, common slut?

357
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,289
I should've pushed her
from someplace higher

358
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:23,929
and ended things.

359
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:25,309
Damn it.

360
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:15,469
I'm sorry, Eun-yi.

361
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,460
I can't believe
I made a mistake like that.

362
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:19,920
You understand, right?

363
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,130
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:23,059
Your friend got you
some herbal medicine?

365
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,449
I should've done that.

366
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,789
No, I'm fine, ma'am.
I'll be up again soon.

367
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,159
I'm late for work.

368
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:34,699
Bye.

369
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,280
Drink that lying down.
Go on. Lie down.

370
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:58,420
How could that bastard
do this to me?

371
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:02,369
In my house, with the bitch
who washes my underwear.

372
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,630
You made her wash
your underwear?

373
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:09,500
No need for you to resent Hoon.

374
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:13,739
From the day he was born,

375
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,280
he had everything
he ever wanted.

376
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,349
Whatever he saw
if he wanted it, it was his.

377
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:27,599
No matter what.

378
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,849
All the men
in that family are like that.

379
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:34,579
Look at your mother-in-law.

380
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,579
She suffered through such awful
things because of those guys.

381
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,969
Normal people
can't even imagine it.

382
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:49,130
But she endured it all
to become who she is today.

383
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,139
And look at her now.

384
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,260
Everyone worships
the ground she walks on.

385
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,219
You'll be like that, too.

386
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:04,599
And your children
will be like Hoon.

387
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:08,769
That's what both
you and I want, isn't it?

388
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:17,250
Let him sleep around
all he wants.

389
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:22,420
Later, you can enjoy yourself
and live like a queen.

390
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,780
You know...

391
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,210
This house is kind of scary.

392
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:40,440
Why?

393
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,909
Last night...

394
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:48,679
What about last night?

395
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,500
Had a nightmare?

396
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,110
I think I'd better
quit working here.

397
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:15,710
Then pack up now and go.

398
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:17,670
But until they find
someone else...

399
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,079
Look.

400
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:22,900
No one in this family will care
that you're gone.

401
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,630
Just go.

402
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,250
But I should tell them...

403
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:31,260
Just cut the bullshit
and leave.

404
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:52,809
What if she shows up one day
with her baby?

405
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,329
You think a few million dollars
would solve the problem?

406
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,159
She'll hinder you for life,

407
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:06,070
and be a thorn in the side
of Nami and the twins, too.

408
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,090
You should deal with it now.

409
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,800
Make her get rid of it
before it's too late.

410
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,050
Come in.

411
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:26,440
Sit down.

412
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,800
I'm sorry to say this.
But something came up.

413
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:39,769
What is it?

414
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,849
It's a family matter.

415
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,360
What are you doing?

416
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,110
I said, what are you doing?

417
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:12,820
I treated you
humanely and nicely.

418
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:17,119
Didn't I?

419
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:35,239
I'm sorry, ma'am.

420
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,610
About what?

421
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:55,050
I'll see myself out.

422
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,820
Stay right there, please.

423
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,420
I apologize.

424
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:02,380
For what?

425
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,440
Mother?

426
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,420
Sit up straight.

427
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,409
Let's go get an abortion.

428
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:30,610
Then you can take this
and leave.

429
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,449
Then we'll all go back
to living in peace.

430
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:39,250
That's a $100,OOO check.

431
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:45,900
That thing inside you,
it's nothing.

432
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:50,070
You can just cut it off,
like a cyst.

433
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,039
Think wisely.

434
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,150
But how did you all know?

435
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,699
I'll give you a few days,

436
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:10,699
but you won't get yourway,
eVer.

437
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,630
She's been so affectionate
to the kids in my stomach.

438
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,000
So her own kid...

439
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,780
She won't give up the baby
for all the money in the world.

440
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,650
Never.

441
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:05,710
Stupid!
Imbecile!

442
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,619
I should've
thought of Madam...

443
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:27,779
I did a horrible thing.

444
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,840
It's her husband
who should've thought of her.

445
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,949
Did the hospital tell them
I am pregnant?

446
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:55,810
If you want more money, ask.
They'll pay.

447
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,319
And forget the baby.

448
01:09:04,989 --> 01:09:07,270
Look.

449
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,140
Do you really want to
have this baby and bring it up?

450
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:14,989
I'm not sure.

451
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:26,359
Why'd you just stand still
and let her slap you like that?

452
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:31,899
I'm sorry.

453
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:35,569
Don't be sorry!
Damn!

454
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:58,829
You're still awake?

455
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:03,970
You sleep first, tonight.
I'll watch over you.

456
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,229
I'm sorry.

457
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,420
About what?

458
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:30,390
Grandma pushing the ladder
on purpose.

459
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,039
I saw it.

460
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:49,619
It was an accident
because of the vacuum cleaner.

461
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:05,770
You're a good person.
I feel bad.

462
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:00,739
"Herbal medicine"

463
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:29,640
- Mrs. Cho!
- Yes?

464
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:31,970
Tell her to move
out of this room.

465
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,720
Pardon?

466
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,649
Put her in your room
and keep an eye on her.

467
01:13:17,569 --> 01:13:19,300
Why did you move to this room?

468
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:26,939
A new nanny will come.

469
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,300
Why?
Are you sick?

470
01:13:31,649 --> 01:13:33,350
It's not that.

471
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,779
There's a baby
inside my tummy, too.

472
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:41,100
Is it a boy or a girl?

473
01:13:43,829 --> 01:13:47,260
I hope it's a girl like you.

474
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,640
I'm not sure yet.

475
01:13:51,069 --> 01:13:52,649
It's still too small, right?

476
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:00,399
Nami...

477
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:03,140
Yes?

478
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,069
Nami...

479
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:13,609
Nami?
Your mother's waiting.

480
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,369
Bye, Eun-yi.

481
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:28,069
I hope you deliver safely.

482
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,590
- Where were you?
- Never mind.

483
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:39,399
Keep an eye on that woman.

484
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,890
Yes.

485
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:07,149
What a relief!

486
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,960
Liberation!

487
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:43,649
Madam Cho?

488
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:55,989
I'm having this baby.

489
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,600
Go ahead.

490
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:24,789
Hello, Mother.
Thank you for being here.

491
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,779
Right on time
despite being so busy.

492
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,590
Go on in.

493
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,329
Let's eat.

494
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:09,079
They even took my cell phone.

495
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,739
Sit.

496
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:34,000
What do they think
they can do to my baby?

497
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:40,050
These people are scary.

498
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:43,420
I'm scared something awful
might happen to you.

499
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,960
Bravo.

500
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,529
Well done, my sweetie.

501
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,689
Thank you, honey.

502
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,310
Get some rest.
I'll go change and come back.

503
01:19:06,189 --> 01:19:09,149
Son of a bitch.

504
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:13,050
That's enough, okay?
Stop there.

505
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,520
After these precious angels
were just born...

506
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:37,760
My stomach.

507
01:20:49,789 --> 01:20:51,630
I don't need anything.

508
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,649
Damn bitch.
How dare she!

509
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,590
What are you doing there?

510
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,520
I was feeling
under the weather.

511
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:07,729
Wanna join me?

512
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:13,310
As you wish...

513
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,479
Were the twins born?

514
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:18,989
What's wrong with you?

515
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,510
I'm pregnant.

516
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,550
But the ladies of the house
found out everything.

517
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:45,130
They really smacked me around.

518
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:50,720
They said they'd give me
$1OO,OOO if I have an abortion.

519
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:57,710
But I'm having this baby.

520
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:04,250
What are you doing in there?

521
01:23:04,789 --> 01:23:06,369
Get out of there, now!

522
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:26,460
I know you don't even
think of me as human.

523
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:29,220
But this baby is yours!

524
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:54,180
No! Don't do this!
No, baby!

525
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:38,689
I'll just disappear quietly
and live with my baby.

526
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:44,500
I couldn't hurt anyone,
and I don't need money.

527
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,409
You're the father.
This is your baby, too.

528
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:56,729
Calm down, Ms. Lee.

529
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,670
Let's have the baby, okay?

530
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:14,350
Thank you, Mr. Goh.

531
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:17,279
Sorry for getting pregnant
from someone like you.

532
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:42,979
She was squirming
in such pain,

533
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:44,949
I gave her a shot
of something strong.

534
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,470
Good work.

535
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:51,100
The men in this family
are really something.

536
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,779
- See you.
- Bye.

537
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,939
Pack her things
and send her out.

538
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:57,930
Don't let her back here, ever.

539
01:25:58,199 --> 01:25:59,489
Yes, ma'am.

540
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:04,430
Mr. Goh wants to see you.

541
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,409
- Me?
- Yes.

542
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:10,270
- He saw her?
- Yes, ma'am.

543
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,869
Is the baby dead?
Completely?

544
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:46,229
Oh, it seems she fooled around
and came in pregnant.

545
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,699
Why do you even care?

546
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:54,489
Ma'am!
I'll ask the questions.

547
01:26:59,789 --> 01:27:02,189
The baby's completely erased?

548
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,579
Yes.

549
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:08,779
She said it was my baby.

550
01:27:09,069 --> 01:27:10,909
Who says?

551
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:21,489
She'd say anything to try
to rip some money off us.

552
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:31,000
If it wasn't mine
why go through all the trouble?

553
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:37,859
Did you slip her some poison?

554
01:27:38,329 --> 01:27:40,060
It wasn't me.

555
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:43,350
Then who was it?

556
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,170
Your daughter?

557
01:27:51,109 --> 01:27:53,859
Sorry.
It was me.

558
01:27:54,279 --> 01:27:56,649
Are you completely insane?

559
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,279
This is a real shock to me.

560
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:06,010
It's my child.

561
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:09,920
How dare you think
you can do that?

562
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:12,359
Who has the nerve!

563
01:28:20,909 --> 01:28:22,640
Look.

564
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:24,310
Is it not my child

565
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:27,819
if your daughter
doesn't give birth to it?

566
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,649
Is that it?

567
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:37,350
No, course not.

568
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:06,800
Did you get a signature?

569
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,300
Just do it.
It's an emergency.

570
01:29:30,109 --> 01:29:32,569
Isn't that woman outside
her mother?

571
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,789
No.
It's no one.

572
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:11,279
It was probably Hae-ra
who did it.

573
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:20,100
Scary people.
Probably why they're so rich.

574
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:27,199
Nami said...

575
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:31,979
She saw her grandmother push me
from the second floor.

576
01:30:32,609 --> 01:30:37,409
She apologized,
and said she felt sorry for me.

577
01:30:40,779 --> 01:30:42,739
Kids don't lie.

578
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:46,359
But I didn't even know
I was pregnant then!

579
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,869
I did.

580
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:56,670
Nothing goes on in that house
without me knowing.

581
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,260
I knew everything.

582
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:14,380
When you came home
from the hospital,

583
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,930
your baby's fate was decided.

584
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,050
Even if I hadn't told them...

585
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:31,170
I'm sorry.

586
01:31:38,069 --> 01:31:39,329
I'm ashamed.

587
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,390
But a woman like me...

588
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:47,340
...it's in my bones.

589
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:15,720
Take this and find someone nice.

590
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:20,090
You'll be fine
you have a good heart.

591
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:35,220
I'm going to get revenge.

592
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:40,430
I know.
Anyone would want to.

593
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:49,260
No! However small
I have to do something!

594
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:17,829
Damned world has been
so cruel to me.

595
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,939
You poor thing.

596
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,479
I'll apologize for them.
Happy?

597
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:35,810
Their daughter, Nami...

598
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:39,789
She was genuinely nice to me.

599
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:42,510
Stop thinking about it.

600
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:48,289
I wanted to have a pretty
little daughter like her.

601
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:53,479
A girl who's kind to me.

602
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:56,460
Wipe those thoughts
from your head.

603
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,539
I smell like the restaurant
don't I?

604
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:09,930
No.

605
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:15,789
Go to sleep.
And forget it ever happened.

606
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:34,800
R.U.N.S., R.U.N.S.

607
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,060
We haven't done it for ages.

608
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,739
You're unclean.

609
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,460
Me?

610
01:35:14,689 --> 01:35:16,739
Put your hand
on your heart and think.

611
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,720
All right.

612
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:33,289
Still, tell me when you're ready
for our 4th and 5th kids.

613
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:51,949
Ms. Lee!

614
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:56,520
What the hell
are you doing here?

615
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,810
"What the hell
are you doing here?"

616
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:11,409
- Leave the baby alone.
- "Leave the baby alone."

617
01:37:25,579 --> 01:37:28,359
- Go, go!
- I'm going!

618
01:37:28,789 --> 01:37:29,930
- Honey!
- "Honey!"

619
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:31,640
- Honey!
- "Honey!"

620
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,100
What's going on?

621
01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:37,199
She's crazy!

622
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:43,609
Mrs. Cho?
How did that bimbo get in here?

623
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:45,479
Who let her in?

624
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,569
Kick her out, now.

625
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:49,649
Call the men
if you can't do it alone.

626
01:37:49,939 --> 01:37:53,510
I quit.
I'm leaving this house, now.

627
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:56,220
What's this all of a sudden?

628
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:00,010
I'm already packed to go.

629
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,770
Where do you get the nerve?

630
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:08,100
Chase that crazy bitch out
before you go!

631
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:11,680
Never shut up, do you?

632
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,439
From now on, if you want
something do it yourselves.

633
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,729
I quit.

634
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:19,970
What are you doing, Mrs. Cho!

635
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:23,039
What the hell are you doing?

636
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,140
You really want to
live like this?

637
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:31,329
This is what these people
are like.

638
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,819
Just ignore her.

639
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,859
Eun-yi!

640
01:38:36,289 --> 01:38:38,720
Nami, how have you been?

641
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:42,460
Okay.
What about you?

642
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,329
You must be so happy to have
two angelic little brothers.

643
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:47,819
It's so-so.

644
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,189
What about the baby
inside your tummy?

645
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:55,539
My baby?

646
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,210
It died.

647
01:38:57,439 --> 01:38:59,430
Why?

648
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,199
Eun-yi?

649
01:39:16,529 --> 01:39:18,020
Don't do it.

650
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,689
Walk out of here with me.

651
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:23,000
I can't get it
out of my head...

652
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:25,520
what happened here.

653
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,680
It's so horrible...

654
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,369
I can't take it anymore.
That's why.

655
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,779
Ms. Lee.

656
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:41,060
I apologize for what happened.
I'll settle with you as needed.

657
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:43,130
You know me.
