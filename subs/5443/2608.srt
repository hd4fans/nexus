1
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,111
(man) Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,250
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,788
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:27,292
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,523
... to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,758
...in my actions.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,292
At this moment...

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,998
...this is me...

9
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,701
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,301
Bill.

11
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:47,675
It's your ba...

12
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,650
(woman) Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,381
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56,455 --> 00:01:00,016
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:03,289
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:06,695
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:11,870
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:15,429
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:18,533
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,172
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,082
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,416
but I've only one more.

23
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,547
The last one.

24
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,151
The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:38,060
The only one left.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,793
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:45,064
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,128
(@ instrumental)

29
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,832
(woman) The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

30
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:17,062
that put this whole gory story into motion

31
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,764
has since become legend.

32
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:22,534
"Massacre at Two Pines. "

33
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,599
That's what the newspapers called it.

34
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,508
The local TV news called it,

35
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:30,571
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre. "

36
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:33,345
How it happened, who was there,

37
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,354
how many got killed
and who killed them -

38
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,983
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

39
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:45,497
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

40
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,964
It was a wedding rehearsal.

41
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,593
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

42
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,901
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,306
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,367
(laughter)

45
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,606
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,843
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,509
(laughter continues)

48
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:09,611
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,789
Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:19,628
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

51
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,689
- Sure.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,099
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,263
Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,399
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

55
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,467
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,445
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:39,848
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,513
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

59
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:47,787
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,318
Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,595
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

62
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:00,160
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

63
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,901
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

64
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,205
Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:09,373
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:12,679
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

67
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:16,687
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

68
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:20,020
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:22,960
Right...

70
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,020
Well, I don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,363
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,495
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,300
But, uh...

74
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:38,605
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,838
You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,841
Well, I don't have anybody...

77
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,853
...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:53,358
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

79
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:57,691
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:03,457
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,936
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,133
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,838
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:16,574
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:19,082
(Reverend) Right...

86

(@ flute)

87
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,526
Hello, Kiddo.

88
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:47,395
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

89
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,211
What are you doin' here?

90
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,804
What am I doin'?

91
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,243
Well...

92
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,652
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

93
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,689
At this moment...

94
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:17,258
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

95
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,698
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

96
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,107
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

97
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,416
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

98
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,683
Hmm.

99
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,189
I always told you...

100
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,591
...your sweet side is you best side.

101
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:47,155
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

102
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:52,901
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,437
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

104
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:05,112
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

105
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,743
Have you seen Tommy?

106
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:13,083
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

107
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,285
Then I saw him.

108
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,554
I like his hair.

109
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,264
You promised you'd be nice.

110
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:28,161
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

111
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,238
But you're right.

112
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,404
What does your young man
do for a living?

113
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,149
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

114
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:43,916
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

115
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,252
Aren't we all?

116
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,696
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

117
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:59,328
I work in the record store.

118
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,862
Aso.

119
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:06,001
It all suddenly seems so clear.

120
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:12,850
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

121
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,647
I get to listen to music all day...

122
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,715
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,223
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

124
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:32,765
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

125
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:37,639
and being paid vast sums of money?

126
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,040
Precisely.

127
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,103
Well, my old friend...

128
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,546
...to each his own.

129
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:49,178
However, all cockblockery aside...

130
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,712
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

131
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:58,058
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

132
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,360
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

133
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,538
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

134
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:12,065
Your side always was a bit lonely.

135
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,177
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

136
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,574
You know...

137
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,119
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

138
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,621
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

139
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,982
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,492
Arlene's told me so much about you.

141
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,359
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

142
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,525
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,330
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,166
Oh, my God, this is great!

145
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,036
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

146
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,406
The name's Bill.

147
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,809
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

148
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,076
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

149
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,414
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

150
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:57,887
Well, in the surprise department...

151
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:01,392
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

152
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,621
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

153
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,823
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

154
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:10,698
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

155
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,828
...no one could reach you.

156
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:16,169
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

157
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,334
So...

158
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,176
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

159
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:26,479
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

160
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,882
We thought,

161
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,150
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

162
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,215
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

163
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:38,023
So, I think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

164
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,730
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

165
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,827
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

166
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,200
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

167
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,170
I know just what you mean.

168
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,443
(Reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

169
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,177
(Rufus) Sure do.

170
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,688
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

171
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:07,748
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

172
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:11,557
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

173
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,098
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

174
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:17,157
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

175
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,203
That's asking a lot.

176
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,501
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

177
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,339
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

178
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,141
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

179
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,808
Deal. We got to do this now.

180
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:35,876
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

181
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,923
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

182
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,618
(Reverend) Mother, here we go!

183
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,358
Now son, about them vows...

184
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,367
(@ guitar)

185
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,104
Bill...

186
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:02,738
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

187
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,374
If he's the man you want...

188
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,510
...then go stand by him.

189
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:35,845
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

190
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,989
Thank you.

191
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,052
(Reverend) What the hell?

192
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,461
(screaming)

193
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,499
(bride) No! Bill!

194
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,830
(machine gunfire)

195
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,833
(barking)

196
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,342
(bells toll)

197
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,919
(bird chirps)

198
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:12,668
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

199
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,971
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

200
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,811
They just called themselves
"The Crazy 88"

201
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:21,044
- How come?
- I don't know.

202
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:24,282
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

203
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:27,984
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

204
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:32,052
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

205
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,588
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

206
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:39,231
It would appear he has broken it.

207
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,134
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

208
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,270
Or maybe...

209
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:52,744
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

210
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:57,516
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

211
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,253
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

212
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,788
I, um...

213
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,392
(belches) I pawned that years ago.

214
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,801
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

215
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:15,934
Yep.

216
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,998
It was priceless.

217
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:27,016
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

218
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,077
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

219
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,419
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

220
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,723
(sniffs)

221
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,697
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come down to the club

222
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:43,529
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

223
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:50,070
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

224
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:53,941
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

225
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:58,449
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

226
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,711
and start becoming afraid of (bleep),

227
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:04,516
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

228
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,887
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

229
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,800
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

230
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,411
Can't we just... forget the past?

231
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,309
That woman...

232
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,582
...deserves her revenge.

233
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,518
And...

234
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,393
...we deserve to die.

235
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:53,296
But then again...

236
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,430
...so does she.

237
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,539
So I guess...

238
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,013
...we'll just see.

239
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,180

242

Late again.

Budd, can't you tell time?

244

There ain't nobody in here, man.

- Yeah.

his fucking ass back here!

OK.

Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

249

Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

250
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,515
You looking for me?

251
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:30,061
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

252
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:33,433
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

253
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,166
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

254
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,403
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

255
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,672
Larry...

256
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,681
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

257
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:50,210
(slurring) "There's nobody
out there, Larry."

258
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,552
What's your point?

259
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:57,219
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

260
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:01,925
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,231
You saying that the reason...

262
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:09,137
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

263
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:13,701
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

264
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,312
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

265
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,317
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

266
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,344
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

267
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,754
Well, guess what, buddy?

268
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:32,023
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

269
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,257
Let's go to the calendar.

270
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,596
It's calendar time.

271
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,192
Calendar time for Buddy.

272
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,637
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:46,803
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

274
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,869
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

275
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:52,177
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

276

- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:58,685
I don't think so.
Friday.

278

I d... There's your name.

279
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,861
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

280
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,761
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

281
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:08,856
Uh, Monday...

282
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,423
Here. How about that?

283
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:15,268
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

284
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,969

...the hat.

289

That fucking...

291
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,531
How many times have I told you,

292
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,592
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

293
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,608
Customers wear hats.

294
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:54,338
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

295
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:58,371
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

296
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:03,386
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

300
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,118
There's shitty water all over the floor.

301
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,995
OK... Rocket.

302
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,665
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

And to what do I owe

- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.

349
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,629
I shot her full of rock salt.

350
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:33,363
She's so gentle right now, I could
perform her coup de grace with a rock.

351
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,768
Anywho...

352
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:43,142

A brand spankin' new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

355

And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

-...that's what I call sharp.
- How much?

Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's... priceless and all.

What's the terms?

You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...

360
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,703
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

361
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:18,078
...and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

362
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,984
Now, how do you like the sound of that?

363
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,885
Sounds like we got a deal.

364
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:28,823
- One condition.
- What?

365
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:32,487
She must suffer to her last breath.

366
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,191
(chuckling) Well...

367
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:38,234
That, Elle darlin'...

368
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:41,135
...I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

369
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:45,972
Then I'll see you

I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

...and buried alive.

That's a wise decision.

00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:55,385
head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate -

which is another way

Or did he just fail to see

The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

of the temple's head abbot

that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:59,745
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

486
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:03,343
at the fists of the White Lotus.

487
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,220
And... so began the legend...

488
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,693
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

489
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,991
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

490
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,692
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

491
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:21,836
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

492
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,834
He hits you with his fingertips...

493
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,846
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

494
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:34,941
...and then lets you walk away.

495
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:37,987
But once you've taken five steps...

496
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:42,081
...your heart explodes inside your body...

497
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:45,252
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

498
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:48,421
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

499
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:54,733
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

500
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,870
Now...

501
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:01,274
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

502
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,335
...Kiddo...

503
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:07,777
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

504
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:16,084
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

505
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,786
Whatever...

506
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,820
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

507
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:28,364
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

508
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:33,667
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

509
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:36,940
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

510
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:43,181
And that will be the story of you.

511
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,948
(@ flute)

512
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:06,033
He'll accept you as his student.

513
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:08,202
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

514
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,441
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

515
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:12,947
Why did he accept me?

516
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:17,282
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

517
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:20,584
And like all rotten bastards...

518
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:25,822
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

519
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,864
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

520
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:33,665
but it does teach them
the value of company.

521
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:36,227
Whew. Oh.

522
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:41,209
(sighs) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

523
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,176
You're gonna have a lot of fun

524
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:47,114
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

525
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:53,680
When will I see you again?

526
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:57,248
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

527
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,124
- What?
- Nothin'.

528
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:01,663
When he tells me you're done.

529
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:04,427
When do you think that might be?

530
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,436
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

531
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,133
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

532
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:13,505
At least not for the first year or so.

533
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:16,773
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

534
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:20,680
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

535
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,548
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

536
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:29,323
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

537
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:33,022
- Adios.
- (engine starts)

538
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,454
Master...

539
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,993
Your Mandarin is lousy.

540
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,332
It causes my ears discomfort.

541
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:20,994
You bray like an ass!

542
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,931
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

543
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,436
Is it too much to hope --
you understand Cantonese?

544
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:33,580
I speak Japanese very well--

545
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,949
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese --

546
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,181
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

547
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:41,712
A little.

548
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:46,988
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

549
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,490
If you can't understand me --

550
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:51,055
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

551
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,859
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

552
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:02,808
Bill is your master, is he not?

553
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,204
Yes, he is.

554
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:12,351
Your master tells me --
you're not entirely unschooled.

555
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:14,654
What training do you possess?

556
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:18,152
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

557
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:22,220
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

558
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:23,526
(scoffs)

559
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,090
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

560
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:31,232
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for --

561
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,166
Japanese fat heads!

562
00:48:33,743 --> 00:48:35,734
(laughs)

563
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:43,445
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

564
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:44,577
No.

565
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:47,389
Are you aware I kill at will?

566
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,115
Yes.

567
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,024
Is it your wish to die?

568
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:51,791
No.

569
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:53,894
(laughs)

570
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:54,931
Then you must be stupid...

571
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,331
Then you must be stupid...so stupid.

572
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,131
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

573
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:02,797
Rise.

574
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:12,940
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

575
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,750
What's the matter?

576
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,119
Cat got your tongue?

577
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,558
-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

578
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,625
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

579
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:29,392
Go to that rack.

580
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:38,674
Remove the sword.

581
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,742
(whooshes)

582
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,798
Let's see how good you really are.

583
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,297
If...

584
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:11,667
...you land a single blow,

585
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:15,138
I'll bow down and call you master.

586
00:50:15,878 --> 00:50:18,108
(whipping)

587
00:50:19,982 --> 00:50:21,916
(grunts)

588
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:23,508
(grunts)

589
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:27,849
(grunting)

590
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:31,792
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

591
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:32,952
(thud)

592
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,365
(laughs)

593
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:40,366
Your swordsmanship --
is amateur at best.

594
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,969
(whipping)

595
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:47,840
(grunting)

596
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:59,853
Your so-called kung-fu -- is really --
quite pathetic.

597
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:06,492
I asked you to demonstrate --
what you know -- and you did...

598
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:08,390
Not a goddamn thing!

599
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:13,094
Let's see your Tiger Crane --
match my Eagle's Claw.

600
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,233
(whooshes)

601
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:30,251
(grunting)

602
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,560
(grunts)

603
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:48,360
(grunting)

604
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:51,769
(grunts/laughs)

605
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:00,005
(grunting continues)

606
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,978
(laughs)

607
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,077
(screams)

608
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,182
(screams)

609
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:12,227
Like all Yankee women...

610
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,787
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

611
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,560
Excruciating -- isn't it?

612
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:19,896
Yes!

613
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,801
If it was my wish...

614
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,637
...I could chop your arm off.

615
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:25,969
No, please don't!

616
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,373
(laughs)

617
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:29,741
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

618
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:32,609
If you can stop me -- I suggest you try.

619
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,775
(screams)

620
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,839
I can't.

621
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:38,247
Because you're helpless?

622
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:40,019
Yes.

623
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:44,751
Have you ever felt this before?

624
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:45,957
No.

625
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,628
Compared to me -- you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

626
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:51,827
YES!!!

627
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:54,764
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG!

628
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,171
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

629
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:07,473
Yes!

630
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:11,815
Your training will begin -- tomorrow.

631
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,925
(yells)

632
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:21,961
Since your arm now belongs to me...

633
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,162
...I want it strong.

634
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,134
Can you do that?

635
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,499
I can, but not that close.

636
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:31,970
Then you can't do it.

637
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:36,975
What if your enemy --
is three inches in front of you...

638
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:39,309
...What do you do then...

639
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:41,541
...Curl into a ball...

640
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,481
...or do you put your FlST through him?

641
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:46,817
Now begin.

642
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:58,528
(grunts)

643
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,931
(grunts)

644
00:54:10,312 --> 00:54:12,280
(grunts)

645
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:15,473
(grunts)

646
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:18,179
(groans)

647
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,579
It's the wood that should
fear your hand --

648
00:54:20,656 --> 00:54:23,124
-- not the other way around.

649
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:28,192
No wonder you can't do it --
you acquiesce to defeat --

650
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,697
-- before you even begin.

651
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,732
(scoffs)

652
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,748
(grunting)

653
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,079
(continues grunting)

654
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:55,146
(grunting)

655
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,764
(continues grunting)

656
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:13,568
(gasping)

657
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,853
(grunting)

658
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:30,652
(yelling)

659
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:41,628
(continues yelling)

660
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:46,270
(rainfall)

661
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:11,655
(chopsticks fall)

662
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,404
If you want to eat like a dog...

663
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:23,668
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

664
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,082
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

665
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,175
...pick up those sticks.

666
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,187
(sighs)

667
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,021
(sighs)

668
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,571
(whoosh)

669
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,953
(grunts)

670
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:08,175
(grunts)

671
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:05,726
Come on, you bitch.

672
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:08,700
(grunts)

673
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,336
OK, Pai Mei.

674
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,879
Here I come.

675
01:00:56,552 --> 01:01:00,352
(grunting)

676
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,949
(grunting faster)

677
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:05,515
(gasping)

678
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:09,481
(wheezing)

679
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,725
(grunts)

680
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:23,964
(gasping)

681
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:32,811
(wheezing)

682
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,552
(breathing softly)

683
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:55,197
(chimes)

684
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:06,641
May I have a glass of water, please?

685
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,135
(screeching)

686
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:47,208
-Sothat's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

687
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,108
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

688
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:54,273
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

689
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:56,783
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

690
01:05:57,652 --> 01:05:59,449
Paula...

691
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:03,047
...Schultz.

692
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:09,795
Can I look at the sword?

693
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:13,426
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

694
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:16,198
It sure is.

695
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:18,671
Well then, it's your sword now.

696
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,653
(blender whirring)

697
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:39,893
What's that you said?

698
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:42,361
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword?

699
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,762
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

700
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:47,597
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

701
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,162
Yeah, once.

702
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,003
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

703
01:07:03,118 --> 01:07:06,645
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

704
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:12,056
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

705
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:17,030
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

706
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,300
(sniffs/clears throat)

707
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,808
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

708
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,944
So...

709
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:42,512
...which "R" are you filled with?

710
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,282
What?

711
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:49,888
They say...

712
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:52,160
...the number one killer...

713
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,259
...of old people...

714
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,669
...is retirement.

715
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:03,735
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

716
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,679
I've always figured that...

717
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:10,809
...warriors and their enemies...

718
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,548
...share the same relationship.

719
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,989
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

720
01:08:17,058 --> 01:08:19,185
on the battlefield...

721
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:23,287
...which "R" ya filled with?

722
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,091
Relief...

723
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:31,467
...or regret?

724
01:08:33,174 --> 01:08:37,543
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

725
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,647
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

726
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,478
But I know damn well that you feel one...

727
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,181
...more than you feel the other.

728
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:52,386
And the question was:
Which one is it?

729
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:55,757
Regret.

730
01:08:57,532 --> 01:08:59,966
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

731
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:04,904
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

732
01:09:04,973 --> 01:09:07,066
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

733
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,508
And I tried to tell him...

734
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:11,772
...she was just smart for a blond.

735
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:32,762
Thanks a bunch.

736
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,510
(sniffs/clears throat)

737
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:45,137
(chuckles)

738
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:47,078
All right.

739
01:09:47,148 --> 01:09:49,844
(hissing)

740
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:52,546
(screaming)

741
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:04,188
(continues screaming)

742
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:19,338
Mmm.

743
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:21,314
I'm sorry, Budd.

744
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,011
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

745
01:10:24,085 --> 01:10:27,612
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

746
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:30,681
Black mamba, this is Budd.

747
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,227
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

748
01:10:33,294 --> 01:10:35,558
I looked him up on the lnternet.

749
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,827
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

750
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,265
Listen to this:

751
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:42,558
(groans)

752
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,870
"ln Africa, the saying goes,

753
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:52,140
"'ln the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

754
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:56,240
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

755
01:10:56,317 --> 01:11:00,754
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

756
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:06,556
Hence its handle, 'Death lncarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

757
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,830
"lts neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

758
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,234
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

759
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:19,831
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

760
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,638
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

761
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:26,146
"However, a bite to the face or torso

762
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:29,843
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

763
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,149
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

764
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:37,822
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

765
01:11:37,892 --> 01:11:41,089
can be gargantuan."

766
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:43,722
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

767
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,392
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

768
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:50,068
"lf not treated quickly with antivenom,

769
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:52,971
"ten to 1 5 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

770
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,601
"However, the black mamba can deliver

771
01:11:55,677 --> 01:12:00,478
as much as 1 00 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

772
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,654
Now...

773
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:11,249
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

774
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,261
Iet me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

775
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:20,693
Right at this moment...

776
01:12:20,768 --> 01:12:24,397
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

777
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:31,976
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

778
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:38,178
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

779
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:42,121
alkie, piece of shit like you.

780
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,356
That woman deserved better.

781
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:49,294
(moans/stops moaning)

782
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,396
(cell phone rings)

783
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:31,563
Bill...

784
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:35,232
...I have some tragic news.

785
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:39,311
Your brother's dead.

786
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,177
I am so sorry, baby.

787
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,751
She put a black mamba in his camper.

788
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:47,687
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

789
01:13:50,825 --> 01:13:52,690
Let me put it this way:

790
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,094
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

791
01:13:57,165 --> 01:14:01,067
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

792
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:04,036
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

793
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:08,474
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

794
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:10,534
and lay them on the grave.

795
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:16,551
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

796
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,109
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

797
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:21,018
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

798
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,557
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

799
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,992
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

800
01:14:27,061 --> 01:14:29,552
Do you want me to come over?

801
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,930
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

802
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:38,568
OK. I'm leaving now.

803
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,803
You go smoke some pot or somethin',
I'll be there soon.

804
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,123
(grunting)

805
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,129
(grunting continues)

806
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:17,273
(grunting continues)

807
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,205
Ugh.

808
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:46,638
Gross.

809
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:09,863
(yelling)

810
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,289
(grunts)

811
01:16:58,179 --> 01:16:59,976
Hi-ya!

812
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:14,592
"T o my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

813
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,504
What's that?

814
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:32,478
Budd's Hanzo sword.

815
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:35,038
He said he pawned it.

816
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:38,745
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

817
01:17:42,423 --> 01:17:45,085
- Elle?
- Bea.

818
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,120
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

819
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:52,860
Just between us girls...

820
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:57,337
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

821
01:17:57,405 --> 01:18:00,135
(screams) Ow!

822
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:04,339
I called him a miserable old fool.

823
01:18:04,412 --> 01:18:08,508
Ooh. Bad idea.

824
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:11,345
Know what I did?

825
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:15,614
I killed that miserable old fool.

826
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:20,487
(Elle) How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

827
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:22,961
I poisoned his fish heads.

828
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:26,488
Elle, you treacherous dog.

829
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,468
(Elle laughs)

830
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:33,403
I - give - you - my - word --

831
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:34,998
(Elle) And I told him,

832
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:38,978
"T o me, the word
of an old fool like you

833
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:43,107
is worth less than nothing."

834
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:44,674
(laughs)

835
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:49,990
That's right.

836
01:18:50,057 --> 01:18:52,025
I killed your master.

837
01:18:52,093 --> 01:18:54,721
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

838
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:57,457
With your own sword, no less.

839
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:03,835
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

840
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:08,032
Bitch...

841
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:10,703
...you don't have a future.

842
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,268
(yelling)

843
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,488
(screaming)

844
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,293
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

845
01:20:04,465 --> 01:20:06,695
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

846
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:17,573
(screaming) I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

847
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:23,110
(screaming) You bitch! You bitch!

848
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:26,711
(moaning/screaming)

849
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:29,915
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

850
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,391
(hisses)

851
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,829
(screaming) Oh, I'll get you!

852
01:20:36,897 --> 01:20:39,832
I'm gonna...

853
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,926
(screaming) Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

854
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,972
(continues screaming)

855
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:48,839
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

856
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:51,776
(screaming) You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

857
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:54,246
(continues screaming)

858
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:57,113
(cries) Oh... shit!

859
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:03,288
(screaming)

860
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:07,418
(wind blowing)

861
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,935
(@ choral music)

862
01:21:57,978 --> 01:22:00,344
(@ male singing in Spanish)

863
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,770
(the bride) Like most men
who never knew their father,

864
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,605
Bill collected father figures.

865
01:22:29,677 --> 01:22:32,669
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

866
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:36,808
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

867
01:22:36,884 --> 01:22:40,980
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico
for over 50 years.

868
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:43,387
His army, the Acuna Boys,

869
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:47,826
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

870
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:50,887
He ran the Acuna Boys.

871
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:57,070
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

872
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:00,164
who could point me in Bill's direction.

873
01:23:02,176 --> 01:23:04,542
Senor Esteban Vihaio?

874
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,445
Yes.

875
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,483
May I join you?

876
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:14,749
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

877
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:18,986
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

878
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,223
Americana?

879
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:26,994
Yes.

880
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:29,729
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

881
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,365
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

882
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,965
I haven't spoken it in a while,

883
01:23:36,043 --> 01:23:39,410
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

884
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,347
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

885
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:46,819
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

886
01:23:46,887 --> 01:23:49,822
I must warn you, young lady...

887
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:52,859
...I am susceptible to flattery.

888
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:57,954
How may I be of service to you?

889
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:08,068
Where's Bill?

890
01:24:10,444 --> 01:24:13,072
Ahh.

891
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:15,172
You must be Beatrix.

892
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:19,412
I can see the attraction.

893
01:24:22,089 --> 01:24:27,425
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

894
01:24:27,494 --> 01:24:31,191
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

895
01:24:31,265 --> 01:24:36,328
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

896
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:39,668
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

897
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:45,372
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

898
01:24:45,446 --> 01:24:51,009
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

899
01:24:56,523 --> 01:24:58,616
Mmm.

900
01:24:58,692 --> 01:25:00,353
You know...

901
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:04,295
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

902
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:07,766
...is always the right thing to do.

903
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:14,764
If we had met when I was
back in business...

904
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:19,404
...you would have been
my number one lady.

905
01:25:21,815 --> 01:25:25,478
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

906
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:32,383
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

907
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:34,393
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

908
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:38,423
The Pussy died. Hmm.

909
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:44,033
Bill shot you in the head, no?

910
01:25:44,104 --> 01:25:46,698
- Yes.
- Hmm.

911
01:25:47,975 --> 01:25:51,069
I would have been much nicer.

912
01:25:51,145 --> 01:25:53,443
I would have just cut your face.

913
01:25:56,517 --> 01:25:58,144
You must forgive me.

914
01:25:58,218 --> 01:26:00,709
Please... you have a drink with me.

915
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:08,322
Clara! (smooches)

916
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:11,592
Coming.

917
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,166
Dos anejo.

918
01:26:18,305 --> 01:26:19,431
(mumbles)

919
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:30,172
Gracias.

920
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:38,515
What were we talking about?

921
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:46,856
Bill.

922
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:52,595
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill.

923
01:26:52,673 --> 01:26:55,164
Yeah. Hmm.

924
01:26:55,242 --> 01:27:00,771
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

925
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,146
I will draw you a map.

926
01:27:04,685 --> 01:27:07,017
Bill is like a son to me.

927
01:27:08,655 --> 01:27:12,648
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

928
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:14,660
Because he would want me to.

929
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,564
Now, that I don't believe.

930
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:21,066
Ahh.

931
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,663
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

932
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,267
Freeze, Mommy.

933
01:28:35,342 --> 01:28:37,333
Bang, bang! Oh!

934
01:28:37,411 --> 01:28:39,641
Oh! She got us, B.B.

935
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:42,648
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

936
01:28:42,716 --> 01:28:45,981
(groaning) I'm dying.

937
01:28:47,454 --> 01:28:50,912
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

938
01:28:52,459 --> 01:28:58,989
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

939
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:04,163
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

940
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,297
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

941
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:10,002
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

942
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:15,776
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

943
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:21,287
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

944
01:29:23,557 --> 01:29:24,546
Bang, bang!

945
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:36,664
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

946
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:39,262
Oh!

947
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:43,366
B.B.

948
01:29:47,347 --> 01:29:51,181
Oh! B.B....

949
01:29:51,251 --> 01:29:53,515
(grunts)

950
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:56,715
I should've known.

951
01:29:56,790 --> 01:30:00,089
You are... the best.

952
01:30:07,067 --> 01:30:09,661
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

953
01:30:10,137 --> 01:30:12,298
I was just playing.

954
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:19,068
I know.

955
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,196
I told her that you were asleep...

956
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:41,132
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

957
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:45,433
And she asked me, "lf Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

958
01:30:45,505 --> 01:30:48,201
then how will she know what I look like?"

959
01:30:48,275 --> 01:30:54,942
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

960
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:58,817
That's what I said.

961
01:30:58,885 --> 01:31:02,218
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

962
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:06,987
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

963
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:10,120
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

964
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,267
Now, let me look at you.

965
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:27,307
Oh.

966
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:35,353
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

967
01:31:35,422 --> 01:31:37,151
You're pretty too, Mommy.

968
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:47,091
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

969
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:48,259
Mnh-mnh.

970
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:50,997
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

971
01:31:51,071 --> 01:31:53,733
Come on. You know what you said.

972
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:58,073
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

973
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,636
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

974
01:32:00,714 --> 01:32:03,205
I said... I said,

975
01:32:03,283 --> 01:32:09,483
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

976
01:32:11,124 --> 01:32:14,890
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

977
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:21,693
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

978
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:25,568
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

979
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,773
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

980
01:32:31,845 --> 01:32:36,646
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

981
01:32:39,519 --> 01:32:44,547
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

982
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:47,525
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

983
01:32:47,594 --> 01:32:51,997
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

984
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:57,560
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

985
01:32:57,637 --> 01:33:02,540
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

986
01:33:04,244 --> 01:33:07,179
I killed him.

987
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:12,344
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfiss.

988
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:17,083
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

989
01:33:17,157 --> 01:33:20,126
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

990
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:25,889
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

991
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:28,161
How did he die?"

992
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:31,329
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

993
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:36,638
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

994
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:40,612
"l accidentally stepped on him."

995
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,614
To which I queried,

996
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:48,177
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

997
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:52,521
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

998
01:33:52,592 --> 01:33:56,528
Mmm. The plot thickens.

999
01:33:56,596 --> 01:34:01,499
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

1000
01:34:01,568 --> 01:34:04,935
And Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

1001
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:09,399
She didn't lie.

1002
01:34:09,476 --> 01:34:13,640
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

1003
01:34:13,713 --> 01:34:17,240
...and put him on the carpet.

1004
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:22,846
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

1005
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:24,754
Flapping.

1006
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:29,659
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

1007
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:33,529
And when you lifted up your foot...

1008
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,661
-...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

1009
01:34:37,737 --> 01:34:40,501
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1010
01:34:43,009 --> 01:34:45,477
She told me later...

1011
01:34:45,545 --> 01:34:47,843
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1012
01:34:47,914 --> 01:34:52,146
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1013
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:57,316
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

1014
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:02,555
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1015
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:10,762
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death..

1016
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:13,465
...knew what it meant.

1017
01:35:14,174 --> 01:35:17,268
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

1018
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:20,279
Well... I love Mommy, too.

1019
01:35:21,748 --> 01:35:23,978
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

1020
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:28,009
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

1021
01:35:28,088 --> 01:35:30,181
I shot Mommy.

1022
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:33,420
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1023
01:35:33,493 --> 01:35:35,154
I shot her for real.

1024
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:37,696
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

1025
01:35:37,764 --> 01:35:42,497
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

1026
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:47,063
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

1027
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,803
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

1028
01:35:53,146 --> 01:35:55,376
And that's when I learned...

1029
01:35:55,448 --> 01:36:00,579
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1030
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:08,888
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

1031
01:36:08,962 --> 01:36:12,125
You OK, Mommy?
Did it hurt?

1032
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:15,895
No, sweetie.

1033
01:36:15,969 --> 01:36:18,369
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1034
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:26,001
Did it make you sick?

1035
01:36:27,347 --> 01:36:31,681
No. It made me sleep.

1036
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:34,447
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

1037
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:38,252
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1038
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:41,453
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1039
01:36:41,528 --> 01:36:46,795
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

1040
01:36:46,866 --> 01:36:48,333
Uh-huh.

1041
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:52,167
Mommy, do you wanna watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

1042
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:54,934
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

1043
01:36:55,008 --> 01:36:57,806
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

1044
01:36:57,877 --> 01:37:00,243
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

1045
01:37:00,313 --> 01:37:04,374
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

1046
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:08,717
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

1047
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:20,999
(boy) When I was little,
my father was famous.

1048
01:37:21,067 --> 01:37:25,401
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

1049
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:28,771
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1050
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:34,109
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1051
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:38,640
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

1052
01:37:38,718 --> 01:37:41,414
he would forget about the killings.

1053
01:37:41,488 --> 01:37:46,653
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

1054
01:37:46,726 --> 01:37:49,422
Maybe that was the problem.

1055
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:52,329
One night, the shogun sent...

1056
01:37:52,432 --> 01:37:56,994
(@ "About Her" by Malcolm McLaren)

1057
01:38:05,178 --> 01:38:10,514
@ My man got a heart

1058
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:17,648
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

1059
01:38:23,563 --> 01:38:30,401
@ Well, no one told me about her

1060
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:33,439
@ The way she lied

1061
01:38:35,975 --> 01:38:42,539
@ Well, no one told me about her

1062
01:38:42,615 --> 01:38:45,914
@ How many people cried

1063
01:38:54,761 --> 01:39:00,427
@ My man got a heart

1064
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:07,463
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

1065
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:12,910
@ My man got a heart

1066
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:20,511
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

1067
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:32,797
@ Well, no one told me about her

1068
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:36,063
@ The way she lied

1069
01:39:38,338 --> 01:39:44,902
@ Well, no one told me about her

1070
01:39:44,978 --> 01:39:48,539
@ How many people cried

1071
01:39:49,382 --> 01:39:55,514
@ But it's too late to say you're sorry

1072
01:39:55,588 --> 01:39:58,148
@ How would I know?

1073
01:39:58,224 --> 01:40:02,024
@ Why should I care?

1074
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:07,761
@ Please don't bother trying to find her

1075
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:12,533
@ She's not there

1076
01:40:14,073 --> 01:40:16,974
I was just admiring your sword.

1077
01:40:17,043 --> 01:40:20,570
Quite a piece of work.

1078
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:24,879
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1079
01:40:25,418 --> 01:40:26,885
He's good.

1080
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:31,924
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1081
01:40:35,061 --> 01:40:39,862
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1082
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:44,199
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1083
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:46,363
That'd do it.

1084
01:40:59,552 --> 01:41:05,650
@ Well, no one told me about her

1085
01:41:11,931 --> 01:41:16,595
@ Well, no one told me about her

1086
01:41:17,637 --> 01:41:22,904
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

1087
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:26,538
Well,

1088
01:41:26,613 --> 01:41:31,846
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1089
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:36,116
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

1090
01:41:36,189 --> 01:41:39,181
bathed in moonlight.

1091
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:42,057
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

1092
01:41:42,128 --> 01:41:48,863
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

1093
01:41:49,535 --> 01:41:53,164
But if you wanna be old school about it..

1094
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:56,868
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

1095
01:41:56,943 --> 01:42:00,709
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1096
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,044
Iike a couple of real-life honest...

1097
01:42:05,318 --> 01:42:10,221
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

1098
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:13,589
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1099
01:42:15,695 --> 01:42:19,426
(laughing) I'm just fuckin' with you.

1100
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,428
Now...

1101
01:42:23,503 --> 01:42:26,063
...when it comes to you...

1102
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:28,130
...and us...

1103
01:42:29,742 --> 01:42:32,905
...I have a few unanswered questions.

1104
01:42:32,979 --> 01:42:39,441
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

1105
01:42:39,519 --> 01:42:44,786
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1106
01:42:44,857 --> 01:42:49,089
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1107
01:42:49,162 --> 01:42:51,653
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1108
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:57,101
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

1109
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:01,573
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1110
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:05,133
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1111
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:12,014
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1112
01:43:12,085 --> 01:43:14,110
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1113
01:43:14,187 --> 01:43:15,950
Well,

1114
01:43:16,022 --> 01:43:18,013
it just so happens,

1115
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:20,218
I have a solution.

1116
01:43:20,293 --> 01:43:22,727
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

1117
01:43:22,795 --> 01:43:24,956
(grunting) Goddamn!

1118
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,397
(laughs)

1119
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:30,868
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

1120
01:43:30,937 --> 01:43:34,668
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1121
01:43:35,441 --> 01:43:38,308
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1122
01:43:43,049 --> 01:43:49,318
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

1123
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:53,917
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

1124
01:43:53,993 --> 01:43:57,121
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1125
01:43:57,196 --> 01:44:02,691
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

1126
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:08,503
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

1127
01:44:08,574 --> 01:44:11,566
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1128
01:44:11,644 --> 01:44:14,613
- No.
- Too bad.

1129
01:44:15,748 --> 01:44:18,046
As you know...

1130
01:44:18,117 --> 01:44:21,575
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

1131
01:44:22,388 --> 01:44:25,255
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1132
01:44:25,324 --> 01:44:30,887
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1133
01:44:30,963 --> 01:44:35,559
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1134
01:44:35,635 --> 01:44:38,695
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well-drawn.

1135
01:44:40,339 --> 01:44:42,034
Mmm.

1136
01:44:42,108 --> 01:44:44,508
But the mythology...

1137
01:44:44,577 --> 01:44:47,944
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

1138
01:44:48,014 --> 01:44:52,280
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1139
01:44:52,351 --> 01:44:56,287
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

1140
01:44:56,355 --> 01:45:01,554
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

1141
01:45:01,627 --> 01:45:04,653
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1142
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:08,962
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1143
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:13,970
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1144
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:19,205
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1145
01:45:19,278 --> 01:45:25,114
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1146
01:45:25,184 --> 01:45:28,017
Superman didn't become Superman.

1147
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:30,783
Superman was born Superman.

1148
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:35,191
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1149
01:45:35,261 --> 01:45:37,786
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1150
01:45:38,798 --> 01:45:41,961
His outfit with the big red "S" -

1151
01:45:42,034 --> 01:45:45,697
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

1152
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:48,638
Those are his clothes.

1153
01:45:48,708 --> 01:45:53,941
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

1154
01:45:54,013 --> 01:46:00,179
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

1155
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:03,711
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1156
01:46:03,789 --> 01:46:07,054
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1157
01:46:07,126 --> 01:46:09,458
He's weak...

1158
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:12,396
...he's unsure of himself...

1159
01:46:12,465 --> 01:46:14,194
...he's a coward.

1160
01:46:15,234 --> 01:46:20,171
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1161
01:46:21,941 --> 01:46:26,674
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1162
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,110
Aso.

1163
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:32,378
The point emerges.

1164
01:46:34,086 --> 01:46:37,613
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1165
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:41,456
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1166
01:46:41,527 --> 01:46:46,487
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1167
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:48,727
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1168
01:46:56,075 --> 01:46:58,339
Are you calling me a superhero?

1169
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:00,606
I'm calling you a killer.

1170
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,581
A natural born killer.

1171
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:07,278
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1172
01:47:07,353 --> 01:47:09,583
Moving to El Paso...

1173
01:47:09,655 --> 01:47:13,056
...working in a used record store...

1174
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:15,650
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1175
01:47:15,728 --> 01:47:17,218
...clipping coupons.

1176
01:47:17,296 --> 01:47:19,127
That's you...

1177
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:22,690
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1178
01:47:22,768 --> 01:47:25,794
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1179
01:47:25,871 --> 01:47:28,271
But you're not a worker bee.

1180
01:47:29,275 --> 01:47:32,108
You're a renegade killer bee.

1181
01:47:32,178 --> 01:47:34,976
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1182
01:47:35,047 --> 01:47:38,346
or how fat your ass got,

1183
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:42,285
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1184
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:46,749
First question:

1185
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:54,297
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1186
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:02,030
No!

1187
01:48:05,177 --> 01:48:08,203
But I would've had B.B.!

1188
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:10,977
Don't get me wrong.

1189
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:14,952
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1190
01:48:15,021 --> 01:48:17,546
But you are a killer.

1191
01:48:21,694 --> 01:48:24,458
All those people you killed to get to me...

1192
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,998
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1193
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:31,636
Yes.

1194
01:48:31,704 --> 01:48:34,002
Every single one of them?

1195
01:48:44,283 --> 01:48:46,012
Yes.

1196
01:48:49,355 --> 01:48:51,949
That was the warmup round.

1197
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:57,326
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1198
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:07,665
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1199
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:14,946
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1200
01:49:15,014 --> 01:49:17,448
Of course.

1201
01:49:17,516 --> 01:49:19,541
Lisa Wong.

1202
01:49:20,886 --> 01:49:23,446
The morning I left, I was sick.

1203
01:49:25,124 --> 01:49:27,752
On the plane, I threw up.

1204
01:49:29,595 --> 01:49:33,463
So I started thinking:

1205
01:49:33,532 --> 01:49:35,693
Maybe I was pregnant.

1206
01:49:35,768 --> 01:49:40,228
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1207
01:49:42,408 --> 01:49:44,899
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1208
01:49:44,977 --> 01:49:48,469
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1209
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:49,639
(sighs)

1210
01:49:49,715 --> 01:49:51,945
(clock ticking)

1211
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:25,874
Fuck.

1212
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:28,112
(the bride) What I didn't know...

1213
01:50:28,187 --> 01:50:32,248
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

1214
01:50:32,324 --> 01:50:38,422
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

1215
01:50:38,497 --> 01:50:41,227
- (doorbell)
- (the bride) Hello, can I help you?

1216
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:44,633
(woman) Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1217
01:50:44,703 --> 01:50:46,500
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1218
01:50:46,572 --> 01:50:49,769
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1219
01:50:49,842 --> 01:50:51,833
Can you just leave it by the door?

1220
01:51:04,323 --> 01:51:07,520
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1221
01:51:07,593 --> 01:51:09,493
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1222
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:12,622
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1223
01:51:12,698 --> 01:51:16,099
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1224
01:51:16,168 --> 01:51:20,332
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1225
01:51:22,007 --> 01:51:24,168
Karen...

1226
01:51:26,111 --> 01:51:28,443
...I just found out...

1227
01:51:28,514 --> 01:51:30,482
...right now...

1228
01:51:30,549 --> 01:51:36,510
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1229
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:39,456
-...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1230
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,793
On the floor by the door...

1231
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:46,991
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1232
01:51:47,066 --> 01:51:48,226
Bullshit.

1233
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:53,165
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1234
01:51:53,239 --> 01:51:56,106
This time...

1235
01:51:56,175 --> 01:51:58,200
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1236
01:52:00,746 --> 01:52:04,341
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1237
01:52:04,416 --> 01:52:06,611
But right now...

1238
01:52:06,685 --> 01:52:09,051
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1239
01:52:09,922 --> 01:52:11,913
Please.

1240
01:52:13,025 --> 01:52:15,425
Just look at the strip.

1241
01:52:17,496 --> 01:52:19,225
Please.

1242
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:25,266
Stay where you are and don't move.

1243
01:52:42,454 --> 01:52:44,820
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1244
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:47,290
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1245
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:00,733
"Easy to use.

1246
01:53:00,806 --> 01:53:05,368
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1247
01:53:05,444 --> 01:53:07,105
Blue means pregnant.

1248
01:53:07,913 --> 01:53:09,904
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1249
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:19,724
Oh, OK.

1250
01:53:19,792 --> 01:53:22,022
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1251
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:24,722
Just go home.

1252
01:53:25,831 --> 01:53:27,924
I'll do the same.

1253
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:34,996
(door opens)

1254
01:53:47,519 --> 01:53:49,111
Congratulations.

1255
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:55,589
(the bride) Before that strip turned blue...

1256
01:53:55,661 --> 01:53:59,097
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1257
01:53:59,164 --> 01:54:02,725
I was a killer who killed for you.

1258
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:05,895
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1259
01:54:05,971 --> 01:54:08,963
onto a speeding train.

1260
01:54:09,041 --> 01:54:11,032
For you.

1261
01:54:12,344 --> 01:54:15,711
But once that strip turned blue...

1262
01:54:15,781 --> 01:54:19,273
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1263
01:54:19,351 --> 01:54:21,819
Not anymore.

1264
01:54:21,887 --> 01:54:24,447
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1265
01:54:27,559 --> 01:54:29,322
Can you understand that?

1266
01:54:32,531 --> 01:54:35,125
Yes.

1267
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,361
But why didn't you...

1268
01:54:37,436 --> 01:54:40,599
...tell me then, instead of now?

1269
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:42,971
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1270
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:45,033
And I didn't want that.

1271
01:54:45,778 --> 01:54:48,008
Not your decision to make.

1272
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,207
Yes.

1273
01:54:50,282 --> 01:54:54,548
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1274
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:59,284
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1275
01:54:59,358 --> 01:55:01,349
But with you...

1276
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:05,557
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1277
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:10,263
I had to choose.

1278
01:55:10,335 --> 01:55:12,326
I chose her.

1279
01:55:14,907 --> 01:55:17,705
You know, five years ago,

1280
01:55:17,776 --> 01:55:22,645
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1281
01:55:22,715 --> 01:55:28,347
you performing a coup de grace on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1282
01:55:30,756 --> 01:55:33,418
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1283
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:37,119
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't l?

1284
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:40,364
I-I'm sorry.

1285
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:42,559
Was that a question?

1286
01:55:43,802 --> 01:55:46,430
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1287
01:55:46,505 --> 01:55:49,736
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1288
01:55:50,642 --> 01:55:51,700
Well?

1289
01:55:52,711 --> 01:55:55,407
When you never came back,

1290
01:55:55,481 --> 01:56:01,647
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1291
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:04,951
Oh! And for the record...

1292
01:56:05,023 --> 01:56:09,221
...Ietting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1293
01:56:09,294 --> 01:56:11,285
is quite cruel.

1294
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:18,568
I mourned you for three months.

1295
01:56:19,371 --> 01:56:23,740
And in the third month of mourning you...

1296
01:56:23,809 --> 01:56:26,175
...I tracked you down.

1297
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:28,372
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1298
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:33,885
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1299
01:56:33,952 --> 01:56:37,444
So I find you...

1300
01:56:37,523 --> 01:56:39,718
...and what do I find?

1301
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:43,125
Not only are you not dead...

1302
01:56:43,195 --> 01:56:47,256
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1303
01:56:49,568 --> 01:56:52,093
And you're pregnant.

1304
01:56:55,407 --> 01:56:57,773
I overreacted.

1305
01:57:06,418 --> 01:57:10,218
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1306
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:12,723
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1307
01:57:12,791 --> 01:57:15,225
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1308
01:57:15,794 --> 01:57:19,730
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1309
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:24,692
I'm a killer.

1310
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:27,671
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1311
01:57:28,273 --> 01:57:31,242
And there are consequences...

1312
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:35,576
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1313
01:57:35,647 --> 01:57:38,207
You experienced some of them.

1314
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:45,315
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1315
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:49,087
Yes. It was.

1316
01:57:51,496 --> 01:57:55,262
Could you do what you did?

1317
01:57:55,334 --> 01:57:59,065
Of course you could.

1318
01:57:59,137 --> 01:58:05,565
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1319
01:58:05,644 --> 01:58:08,670
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1320
01:58:08,747 --> 01:58:10,908
...but you thought wrong.

1321
01:58:17,155 --> 01:58:21,285
You and I have unfinished business.

1322
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,459
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1323

1325

Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

1326
01:59:07,105 --> 01:59:09,266
'Course he did.

1327
01:59:11,143 --> 01:59:13,168
Why didn't you tell me?

1328
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:19,108
I don't know.

1329
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,455
Because I'm...

1330
01:59:24,523 --> 01:59:27,617
...a bad person.

1331
01:59:27,693 --> 01:59:29,786
No.

1332
01:59:31,229 --> 01:59:34,289
You're not a bad person.

1333
01:59:34,366 --> 01:59:37,358
You're a terrific person.

1334
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:39,927
You're my favorite person.

1335
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,742
But every once in a while...

1336
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:47,802
...you can be a real cunt.

1337
02:00:07,299 --> 02:00:09,290
How do I look?

1338
02:00:25,017 --> 02:00:28,350
You look ready.

1339
02:02:14,059 --> 02:02:18,291
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.

1340
02:02:24,369 --> 02:02:26,735
(narrator) Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.

1341
02:02:26,805 --> 02:02:28,796
Let's go to press. Flash.

1342
02:02:28,874 --> 02:02:31,604
Do you have a magpie in your home?

1343
02:02:31,676 --> 02:02:34,042
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1344
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:37,775
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1345
02:02:37,849 --> 02:02:40,317
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1346
02:02:40,385 --> 02:02:43,445
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1347
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:47,982
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.

1349

I'm gonna do.
