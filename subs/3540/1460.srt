我看起来象吗?
Does it look like I'm stealing this car?

00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,920
- 有一点  - 为什么?因为我是黑人?
-Little bit, -Why? Because I'm black?

119
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,163
白人碰到这辆车...
White man has his hand in the car,,,

120
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,525
...你会认为他在做好事 
,,,you give him a Good Samaritan award,

121
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,396
你会想他是在帮别人关掉车灯 
Figure he's going around turning off people's lights,

122
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,533
好了,请出示你的驾照 
All right, license and registration, please,

123
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,608
我不会给你这个纳粹份子看任何东西!
I ain't showing you a damn thing, you Nazi,

124
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,271
- 再说一遍? - 嘿,朋友!
-Excuse me? -Hey, man!

125
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,346
这是我的车 
This here? This is my car,

126
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,913
我没做错什么 
I ain't done nothing wrong,

127
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,608
可我看起来...
The way I see it,,,

128
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,583
- ...你该给我道歉  - 你刚才叫我什么?
-,,,you owe me an apology, -What did you call me?

129

You ain't listening, baby, We ain't got nothing to talk about,

130
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,757
除非你向我说“我错了 ”
Unless it starts with you saying, "I'm sorry,"

131
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,828
你有危险了 
You're on dangerous grounds,

132
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,430
注意你的嘴巴 
Be careful what comes out of your mouth next,

133
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,163
想知道我要说什么吗?

-You're under arrest, -Oh, no,

139
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,577
不是我,你才被捕了  现在我就逮捕你这个笨蛋 
I ain't under arrest, You are, I'm arresting your ass,

140
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,278

Citizen's arrest, You're under arrest for false arrest,

141
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,682
把你的手放在车上! 把手铐给我

够了,靠到车上去 
That's it, get up against the car!

145
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,328
不要让我给你加上“拒捕”的罪名

-Watch my car, I just had it detailed, -Settle down! Understand?

148
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,303
这是警察滥用暴力!
This is police brutality!

149
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,676
你只会添麻烦!
You ain't doing nothing but compounding problems,

150
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,474
- 我受够了这些废话! - 我告诉你,朋友 不要再惹我

You don't think I'll fall for that, do you?

167
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,602
警方不肯公布受害人的名字...
Police are withholding his name...

168
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,239
...但我们获得了这张...

是一只大黄蜂干的

麦克杜菲探长对此回应道:
Detective McDuff had this reaction:

174

175

...并且信任我们的工作

177
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,706
很明显这是一个孤立的事件 
Clearly, this is an isolated incident.

178
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,742
- 是蜜蜂干的  - 给我滚出去

184
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,105

-What's up, man? -What happened to your face?

185
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,446
你们中的一个警员殴打了我  你认为呢?
I was attacked by one of your officers, What do you think?

186
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,138
我的意思是你的这些肿块是怎么回事?
I mean, what happened to the swelling and bruises?

187
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,841
那个呀,只是过敏,蜜蜂叮的 
Oh, that, That ain't nothing but allergies, Bee stings,

188
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,975
再说一遍?

189
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,246
我坐下你们不介意吧,可以 
Y'all mind if I have a seat? Cool,

190
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,155
你们要问黑人兄弟问题,却不给他坐 
Y'all gonna ask a brother questions, don't even offer me a seat,

191
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,159
发生什么事了?
What's happening?

192
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,388
好吧 
All right,

193
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,295
我正关车门的时候, 突然警棍驾到了我脖子上...
While I was being slammed into the car, having billy clubs jammed in my neck,,,

194
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,131

...让一只大黄蜂差点没把我叮死 
,,,also allowed this big-ass bumblebee to nearly sting me to death,

196
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,641
你们知道吗?我还在怀疑那只蜜蜂 是不是这个臭警察派来的 
You know what? I'm not even sure that bee wasn't one of his own,

197
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:54,218
似乎是一种受过训练的反非裔人 蜜蜂,专门用来对付黑人
Like some anti-Africanized attack bee, trained to hate black people,

198
00:15:54,653 --> 00:16:00,649
这就是你们需要调查发现的 
That's the sort of thing y'all gonna uncover in your investigation,,,

199
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,326

202
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,403
我们不能让这家伙去上庭作证 
We can't put this guy on the stand,

203
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,939

-He's unstable, Not to mention that he-- -Yo,

204
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,680

Who's the Planet-of-the Apes-looking lady in the dress?

205
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,379

Handsome man,

我不敢相信 
I don't believe this,

208
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,524
我不干了 这太疯狂了--
I'm calling this off, This is crazy--

209
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,985
不论如何,拉弗蒂侵犯了他的权利 
Like it or not, Rafferty violated his rights,

210
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,062
人们只会这么看 
People won't look the other way,

211
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,028
我们不能再这样下去了 
We can't go through this again,

212
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,227
如果你不起诉他我保证会引发暴力事件 
Drop the prosecution and I guarantee you got a riot on your hands,

213
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,637

-Y'all need to investigate them-- -Mr, Montgomery,,,

,,,all allergies aside, did Officer Rafferty assault you or not?

220
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,459
我还要说多少次?
How many times I gotta say it?

221
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,394
行 我们办正事 
All right, Let's get down to business,

222
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,036
高等法院现在开庭  请就座 
Superior Court is now in session, Please be seated,

223
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,871

Case CV-34259, Honorable Marsha Gailey presiding,

At this time the bee appeared, Right here, There it is, It's coming in,

226
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,182
你无法--
You can't--

227
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,227
你无法在录象带上看到它  但它真的在那儿 
You can't really see it on the tape, but it's there,

228
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,319
好的 
Okay,

229
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,795
我用一根棍子打它 
I'm swatting it with my stick,

230
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:53,565
看,我在用脚踩它,用我长统靴的后跟 
There I am, stomping on it, with the heel of my boot,

231
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,796
一直无法看清 
Kept missing it,

232
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,874
角度不好 
It's not a good angle,

233
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,777
你是否声称案件发生时那儿没有大黄蜂?
Are you claiming there was no bumblebee at the time of the incident?

234
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,448

- 当时有一个大黄蜂,朋友  - 哦,很好

狗叫声 
There were dogs barking,

00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,128
我所知道的就是树丛里有一只花栗鼠 在和乌龟做爱 
For all I know there was a chipmunk in the bushes, humping a turtle,

239
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,027
你一定要注意这种小东西, 它会和任何生物做爱 
You gotta be careful with them chipmunks, They'll hump anything,

240
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,041
请你不要开玩笑,蒙哥马利先生 
This is no laughing matter, Mr, Montgomery,

241
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,271
听着,朋友,我来这儿是为了得到公正  看见那边那个人吗?
Look, man, I came here for justice, Okay, that man right there?

242
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,675
那个人粗暴的对待我 
That man harassed and choked me,

243
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,883
他使用了暴力...

我知道结果如何

It's not the first time I been pulled over for DWB,

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,493

248
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,227

不要停 
Keep it moving,

254
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,129
你一定是那个白人警察,对吧? 揍那个黑人的 
You must be that white cop, huh? Beat up the black guy,

00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,101

256
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,369

,,,you decide to pay your buddy Earl a visit, Things got out of hand,,,

391
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:02,285
...有人开枪了,警察为了及时 逮住汉克也开了枪,而汉克想...
,,,shots are fired, police respond just in time to catch Hank trying to get,,,

392
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,396
...开他的车与带着你一起逃跑,很 可能用枪指着你的头 我说对了吗?
,,,away with you in his car, probably holding you at gunpoint, Am I correct?

393
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:11,467
天才 你太棒了 
Amazing, You are very, very good,

394
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:15,470
等一等 这太疯狂了  我出狱不是为了复仇 
Wait a second, This is crazy, I wasn't out for revenge,

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,270
闭上你的臭嘴!快闭上  我厌倦了你那些该死的谎言 
Shut the hell up! Just shut the hell up, I'm tired of your goddamn lies,

396
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,939
我得到了一个限制令,要你不得在 100英尺内接近这个人 
I got a restraining order saying you can't get within 1 00 feet of this guy,

397
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,984
所以我他妈的根本不在意你说的什么  我所需要的...
So I don't really give a damn what you have to say, All I need from you,,,

398
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:34,022
...是你的证词,还有让他滚回监狱去  明天就回去 
,,,is your testimony and his ass goes back to prison, Tomorrow,

399
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:41,356
没有什么事情能让我看到这小子滚回监 狱更让我高兴了 
Nothing would make me happier than to see this man go back to prison,

400
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,399
好的 
Good,

401
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,298
由于心痛...
For the heartache,,,

402
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,564
...还有精神上的伤害 
,,,and the trauma,

403
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,868
有一次他挥舞着他的警棍...
One time he took the club and he switched it around,,,

404
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,740
...把手打到了我这里 
,,,with the handle sticking out and bop, right there,

405
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,941
你能看到那个小切口吗,就在那儿? 无论怎样....
Can you see that little cut, right there? Anyway,,,,

406
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:05,078
这些所发生的事情让我开始说一些胡话....
What happens is it makes me start saying incoherent,,,,

407
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,159
你看得出 我很容易就把一些无意义的 狗屁东西说出来 婊子养的!
You know, I'm liable to spurt that out, Just incoherent shit, Bitch!

408
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,762
我向你道歉 
I apologize,

409
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,765
医生说我的氧气运输功能有问题  从这儿开始氧气上不来 
My doctor said I'm not getting proper oxygen up through here,

410
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,371
他们说抽出来再呼吸 
They said pump it and breathe,

411
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,065
象运动鞋似的东西 
And it's sort of like that sneaker,

412
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,533
这是个怪异的练习 
It's a weird exercise,

413
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,545
不管怎样,让他回监狱,没有比这让我更 开心的事情了 
Anyway, nothing would make me happier than to see him go to prison,

414
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,013
- 等等! - 回来,贱人!
-Wait a second here! -Get back, bitch!

415
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:38,622

-Shut the hell up, Hank, and I mean it! -You-- The violence,

416
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,191
让我自己冷静一下 
Let me calm myself,

417
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,696
很不幸,你故事中的某些细节有一点 歪曲事实了 
Unfortunately, certain details of your story are slightly skewed,

418
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,161
你什么意思,歪曲事实?
What do you mean, skewed?

419
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,398

428

Yeah, my dog, That's what I'm talking about, man,

429
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:39,814
汉克正在诚心和我道歉的时候...
Hank was right in the middle of this very touching apology,,,

430
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,079
...我发现我的仓库被盗了 
,,,when I discovered that my warehouse was being robbed,

431
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:47,453
因此我和汉克合作一起去抓那些罪犯 
So Hank and l, we banded together to apprehend these outlaws,

432
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,823
要不是你们这些小子插进来,我们早就 逮到那帮罪犯了 
And we would've had them, had not your boys come along,

433
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,453
你说什么?
Excuse me?

434

- 有什么进展? - 最新报告 
-What you got? -The updated report,

We got a 4-59 at the warehouse, but nothing on a van, Coroner has two bodies,

439
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,776
辩方律师声称是自卫  我们可以很轻易的打败他 
DA says self-defense, So we kick them loose,

440
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,649
－18大街的C和L仓库? －对 
-The C and L warehouse on 1 8th? -Yeah,

Not a cop anymore, Hank, so stop acting like one,

442
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,822
我非常乐意随便找个理由把你他妈 的关起来 你懂不懂?
I'm all too happy to find any reason to lock your ass up, You understand?

443

Yeah, we also encountered a naked girl upstairs, handcuffed to a light fixture,

445
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,073
洛拉 
Lola,

446
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:45,506
你认为你还可以给一个兄弟另一个限制令吗?
Do you think you could hook a brother up with another restraining order?

447
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,411

我所有的东西也应该在那儿 
All my stuff should be in here too,

449
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,123
怎么了?
What's up?

450
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,955
对了 
Right,

451
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,995
我不敢相信 我的子弹呢?
I don't believe this, Where's my bullets?

452
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,694
我们不会返还弹药 
We don't return live ammunition,

453
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,035
这样的话,还不如把枪也收回去 
Well, if you're gonna keep the bullets, just keep the gun,

454
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,939
- 好吧好吧  - 把我的枪给我,伙计 
-All right, -Give me my gun, man,

455

Impound lot, Twenty blocks up, seven blocks over,

457
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,620
你想让那个人走着去....

458
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,849
有公车吗? 你知不知道?
Y'all got a shuttle bus? You know what?

You upset my partner, I should set it off up in this,,,,

460
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,327
但你有很多兄弟 
But you got your boys,

461
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,532
汉克,你相信他的看法,伙计?
Hank, you believe his attitude, man?

462
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:44,004
伙计,他们很可能把你车的轮胎 全卸了再还给你 
Man, they probably gonna give you your car back with no tires,

463
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,302
我喜欢你处理这件事的方式 
I like the way you played it back there,

464
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,344
啊,没让他们干涉我们的案子  这非常自然

- 这是我们的事情,是吗? - 滚开!
-This is our bust, right? -Get the hell away from me!

466
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,341
嗨,汉克!你知道不知道?
Hey, Hank! You know what?

467
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,580
迟早你的敌对情绪会影响我们的工作 
Sooner or later, your hostility is officially gonna start affecting our work,

468
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,190
伙计,现在你听我说  你需要做的就是一种--
Now, look, man, All you got to do is kind of--

469
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,725
你忙什么? 我努力在与你谈 
What is you running for? I'm trying to talk to you,

现在看来似乎值得  因此不要再得寸进尺了!
Which right now seems almost worth it, So don't push it!

我向他们投炸弹,投炸弹 
I drop bombs on them, drop bombs on them,

The way I see it, they got a 20-minute head start,

496
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,476

They're probably heading down the 405,

497

有什么问题吗?
What the problem is?

506
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,841
伙计,要我独自来制止这个犯罪吗?
Hey, man, do I got to solve this crime by myself?

507
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,480
难以置信 
Unbelievable,

508
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,263
比较大的,红色卡车  应该容易找到 
Big, red truck, It's gonna be easy to find,

509
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:30,396
也许卡车两边写着“大红”...
It's probably gonna say "Big Red" all along the side of the truck,,,

510
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,735
...用又大又红的字

Well, I used my acute peripheral vision to get a upside-down read,

513
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,646
- 想知道我看见什么了吗? - 什么?
-Wanna know what I saw? -What?

514
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:48,019
其中的一份文件上写着:“CIA劫匪 ”
On one of them papers it said, "ClA heist,"

515
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,250
还有呢?
And?

516
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,521
- 我看到的就这些,“CIA ” - 没了?
-That's all I saw, "ClA," -That's it?

517
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:57,562
行吧,伙计,我说过我的边缘视力 很强的,不是X射线那种穿透力,对吧?
Hey, look, man, I said I got peripheral vision, not X-ray vision, man, All right?

518
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,363
明显的是,我们被一伙真正的...
Now, apparently, we are caught up in some real live,,,

519
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,939
...混蛋盯上了,该死的间谍 
,,,complex-ass, espionage shit,

520
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,168
太好了,伙计,不是吗?
This is great, man, isn't it?

521
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,112
伙计,我们是一种跟真的警察一样的保安 
Me and you, man, we're security guards out here acting like real cops,

522
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,443
- 我曾经是警察,埃尔  - 你一定爱死了,是吧?
-I was a real cop, Earl, -Well, you must've loved it, huh?

523
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,349
我不能相信你放弃了 
I can't believe you gave that up,

524
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,127
是,这是1号路 
Yeah, There's Route 1,

525
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,988
别下高速,这样会快多了 
Stay on the freeway, it's a lot faster,

526
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,962
他们会保持低调的  他们会选择1号路 
They wanna keep a low profile, They're gonna go Route 1,

527
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,535
别下高速,不,别下高速,快 
Stay on the freeway, No, on the freeway, come on,

528
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,036
- 别! - 操!
-Don't! -Oh, shit!

529
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,703
- 赶快! - 高速公路上的交通是这样,伙计 
-Hey, come on! -Freeway traffic, man,

530
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,471
- 别下高速  - 我们在街道中央 
-Stay on the freeway, -We're in the middle of the street,

531
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,772
你们做什么?!
What are you doing?!

532
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,249
- 赶快上车! - 高速公路!
-Let go of the wheel! -Freeway!

533
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,387
你干什么,汉克?!
What are you doing, Hank?!

534
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,886
哦,见鬼!
Oh, shit!

535
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,805
- 天拉!你没事吧? - 没事 
-God! Are you okay? -Yeah,

536
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,171
- 操  - 嗨!
-Shit, -Hey!

537
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,508
不好意思 
Sorry,

538
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,385
- 有人对高速公路的看法算是对了  - 什么?
-Somebody was right about the freeway, -What?

539
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,079
看那边 那不就是大红色卡车吗?
Look at that, You can't tell me that ain't a big, red truck,

540
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,349
对,对 
Yeah, yeah,

541
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,032
座位下有枪 
Gun under the seat,

542
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,968
汉克!汉克!
Hank! Hank!

543
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,806
汉克!
Hank!

544
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,039
放开我!
Get off me!

545
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,336
- 嘿! - 向她开枪,汉克 
-Hey! -Shoot her, Hank,

546
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,913
向这个婊子开枪  汉克就要开枪打你了 
Shoot this big bitch, Hank's about to shoot you,

547
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,642
不,我不向任何人开枪  把他放下...
No, I ain't gonna shoot anybody, Put him down,,,

548
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,287
....慢慢的 不要急 
,,,in a minute or two, No hurry,

549
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,548
我不喜欢别人动我的车 
I don't like nobody messing with my rig,

550
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,157
不要象个娘娘腔,汉克 射她!
Don't be a pussy, Hank, Shoot her!

00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,466
你这个肥婆,大脚,猪屁股,--
You oversized, big-boot, thick-ass, Jerry Springer-reject ass--

552
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,166
- 埃尔,我们走吧  - 不,伙计 
-Earl, come on, Let's go, -No, man,

553
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,535
她还没道歉呢 
Shaq here owes me an apology,

554
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,740
再问一次...
But then again,,,

555
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,037
...你叫什么名字?
,,,what your name is?

556
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,638
布列塔尼 
Brittany,

557
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,645
是吗?
Yeah?

558
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,749
除了无名指,每个手指上 都有个戒指,是吗?(没结婚)
Got a ring on every finger except that lock down one, huh?

559
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,690
你喜欢摔跤是吗?那可是我拿手的  我也喜欢摔跤 
You like to wrestle? Because that's my thing, I like to wrestle,

埃尔 埃尔,快点,我们走 
Earl, Earl, come on, let's go,

561
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,802
给我留个电话号码好吗?
Why don't you give me your number?

562
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:55,742
如果你真的不错,我就给你一个真正大的戒指 
And if you're nice, I'll show you what a real big rig looks like,

563
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,975
埃尔,快点!
Earl, come on!

564
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,550
- 我会打电话给你  - 我们走!卡车开了 
-I'll call you, -Let's go! The truck's leaving,

565

- 我来了,等等,等等  - 快啊!
-I'm with you, Hold on, hold on, -Come on!

566
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,531
- 他们是我们要找的人吗? - 我他妈的怎么知道?
-Think these are our guys? -How the hell am I supposed to know?

567
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,303
不,等等,不 
No, wait, Wait, No,

568
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,303
抱歉 
Sorry,

569
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,539
埃尔!
Earl!

570
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,835
埃尔,来啊!
Earl, come on!

571
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,444
加油,加油!
Come on, come on!

572
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,880
转过来!
Swing around!

573
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,711
哦,我的膝盖!
Oh, my knee!

574
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,121
哦,妈的 
Oh, shit,

来啊,来啊,来啊!
Hey, come on! Come on, come on,

576
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,939
- 你是故意的! - 看啊 
-You did that on purpose, -Look,

577
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,511
难怪警察找不到这车 
So that's why the cops couldn't find the van,

578
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,015
你知道怎么样用电线启动车吗?
Hey, do you know how to hot-wire a car?

579
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:13,782
因为我是黑人,所以就自动知道如何 用电线启动车吗?
Oh, because I'm black, I automatically know how to hot-wire a car?

580
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,791
- 你到底知道不知道? - 知道 
-Do you know how or don't you? -Yeah,

581
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,522
- 但不是因为我是黑人  - 快动手啊 
-But not because I'm black, -Do it then,

582
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,024
- 把腿动一下 腿闭起来  - 快进去 
-Move your leg, man, Close your legs, -Get in there,

583
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,996
- 看见了吗? - 好的,快,快 
-See that? -All right, go, go, go,

584
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,504
好的 
Okay,

585
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,234
看到电线搭上去以后冒出的火花吗?
See that spark when one of them bumped into each other?

586
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,573
是因为红线发出所有能量 
That's because that red wire is what gives off all that energy,

587
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,477
- 我可不管  - 看到怎样冒火花了吗?
-I don't care, -See how that's sparking there?

588
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,878
好了吗?
Got it?

589
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:45,454
- 怎么样了? - 埃尔,雨刮器动了 
-How's that? What's that doing? -Earl, the windshield wipers are on,

590
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,820
一定是94款的车,我准是搭错线了 
Must be a '94, I touched the wrong one,

591
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,624
怎么样了?
How's that?

592
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,225
- 什么声音? - 怎么了?
-What's that? -What the hell?

593
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,296
- 关掉,快关掉! - 哦,快啊 
-Turn it off, Turn it off! -Oh, come on,

594
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,371
拖车里面有人,我们去看看 
Somebody's back in that trailer, Let's take a look,

595
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,017
埃迪,小心!
Eddie, look out!

596
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,933
- 快啊,快啊  - 好了 
-Do it, Come on, come on, come on, -Yeah,

597
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,502
走!
Go!

598
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,661
哦,妈的!
Oh, shit!

599
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,075
谢谢,汉克 
Thanks, Hank,

600
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:24,585
20分钟之内,已经是第二次降落 在这种狗屎上面了 
That's the second time in 20 minutes you landed us in some shit,

601
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,991
嘿,你们是在和埃尔还有汉克作对!
Hey, you messing with Earl and Hank!

602
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,559
你们有什么问题吗?
What the problem is?

603
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,026
我们来看看这些盒子里面到底有什么 
Let's find out what the hell is in these boxes,

604
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,100
哦,汉克!
Oh, Hank!

605
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,394
哦,真臭啊 
Oh, it stinks,

606
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,439
- 哦,妈的! - 抱歉 
-Oh, damn! -Sorry,

607
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,473
妈的,看上去像圣诞节大甩卖 
Damn, it looks like Christmas,

608
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,341
除了这些鱼肠子和桔子皮 
Except for these fish guts and orange peels,

609
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,648
上帝保佑,但愿是枪,但愿是枪 
Please be guns, Please be guns,

610
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,984
那是什么玩意儿?
What the hell is that?

611
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,961
这是个啤酒桶 
This is a beer keg,

612
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,796
不应该啊 
It doesn't make any sense,

613
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,595
你把这些片断连起来就能说明问题了 
It makes sense when you put together the pieces,

614
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,203
什么片断?
What pieces?

615
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,867
很明显 
It's obvious,

616
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,031
ClA,他们把酒偷运到市中心...
The ClA, they're smuggling alcohol,,,

617
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,940
...是为了进一步控制黑人 
,,,into the inner city in an effort to further subjugate the black man,

618
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,846
嘿,你真的相信你说的鬼话吗?
Hey, do you actually believe the crap that comes out of your mouth?

619
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:32,250
哦,在我说完之前我都不能确定 
Oh, I'm never really sure until I'm finished talking,

620
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,491
你认为里面都是啤酒吗?
Think they all kegs?

621
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:42,796
是的,纳什,出了问题 
Yeah, Nash, We got a problem,

622
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,694
这好像是...
Well, what we have here appears to be,,,

623
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,600
...要付22美元押金的普通啤酒桶 
,,,your average, garden-variety, $22-deposit beer keg,,,

624
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,434
...但这个太轻了 
,,,but it's way too light,

625
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,372
- 一定是清淡型的啤酒  - 是的,太淡了 
-lt must be light beer, -Yeah, way too light,

626
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,311
不可能有一磅半重,我们看看里面,怎么样?
Couldn't be a pound and a half, Let's take a peek inside, huh?

627
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,651
里面是空的 
Yeah, she's empty all right,

628
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,151
你认为是双层的,里面藏着东西?
You think there's a double wall? Something stashed in between?

629
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,019
很乐意看一看 
Happy to take a look,

630
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,991
戴上眼镜,孩子们,要不你们会瞎的 
Put on the glasses, boys, or you will go blind,

631
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,268
这气割炬能产生华氏4000度的高温...
This torch burns at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit,,,

632
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,876
...我们来割开这罐子 
,,,so let's slice open this can of peaches,

633
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,805
不可思议 
Incredible,

634
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,471
冷得像冰一样 
She's cold as ice,

635
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,582
太棒了 
Gorgeous,

636
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,947
你能不能离桶稍微远点?
Why don't you and the keg get a room?

637
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,251
先生们,这是...
Gentlemen, what we have here,,,

638
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,625
...一种51区(美国研究飞碟的秘密基地)的, 高科技太空合金 
,,,is an Area 51, high-tech, aerospace alloy,

639
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,097
它非常轻,几乎感觉不到重量  散热极快...
It weighs next to nothing, disperses heat instantaneously,,,

640
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,431
...并且能够抵挡任何人工和自然压力 
,,,and is resistant to almost any force in man or nature,

641
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,266
嗯,是不是很值钱?
Well, is it worth anything?

642
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,536
是的,值好几百万!
Yeah, millions!

643
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,234
所以,我要你们...
Which is exactly why,,,

644
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:06,212
...带上这玩意,滚出我的店 
,,,l want you two to take this thing and get the hell out of my shop,

645
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,580
就我而言,我可不打算马上死掉...
Personally, I don't feel like dying right now,,,

646
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,586
...匹夫无罪,怀壁其罪 
,,,and this is exactly the kind of shit people get killed over,

647
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,551
谢谢 
Thanks,

648
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,532
我们把车藏在这里,去探个究竟 
We'll stash the van here until we find out what's what,

649
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,802
- 这是谁的车库? - 我朋友的,没关系 
-Whose garage is this? -This guy I know, It doesn't matter,

650
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:39,312
不,这不是男人的车库,这里没有电动工具 
No, no, This ain't no guy garage, There ain't a power tool in here,

651
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,780
我们走 
Let's go,

652
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,852
汉克,上面这个盒子上有你的名字 
Hank, this box up here got your name on it,

653
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,818
这不会是你女朋友的房子吧?
This wouldn't be your girlfriend's house?

654
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,350
能帮个忙吗? 别管我的私事?
Could you do me a favor? Could you stay out of my business?

655
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:54,589
哦,有人不高兴了,是吗?
Oh, well, lookie, lookie, lookie, Looks like somebody got dissed, huh?

656
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,063
好吧,我猜猜看,汉克 
All right, let me guess, Hank,

657
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,434
你虐待你女朋友,所以她离开了你 
Your girl left because you beat the shit out of her,

658
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,568
不,很有讽刺意味的是,她离开我...
No, lronically, she left me,,,

659
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,608
...是因为我打了别人而被定罪 
,,,because I was convicted of beating the shit out of somebody else,

660
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,975
哦,是打了我吗?
Oh, me?

661
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,708
伙计,继续啊  听着,汉克,我只是说...
Man, go ahead with that, man, Look, Hank, I'm just saying, man,,,

662
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,315
...我猜因此你才这付臭态度,是吗?
,,,l suppose that's what your attitude is all about? Huh?

663
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,455
汉克没人爱咯 
Hanky ain't getting no loving,

664
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,386
我很乐意回到那里...
I'll be happy to go back in there,,,

665
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,287
...来挽回一切 
,,,and straighten this whole mess out,

666
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,487
- 不用,谢了,你做得够多了  - 不,说真的,汉克 让我来吧,伙计 
-No, thanks, you've done enough, -No, serious, Hank, I wanna do it, man,

667
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,997
埃尔・蒙哥马利是爱情制造者, 而不是破坏者 
Earl Montgomery is a love-maker, not a love-taker,

668
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,659
等等,你是不是说...
Wait a second, Let me get this straight,

669
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,397
你要进去告诉丹尼斯...
You're telling me you'd go in there and tell Denise,,,

670
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,406
...我从没有骚扰过你, 我进监狱是冤枉的?
,,,l never harassed you, and I went to jail for no reason?

671
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,644
当然 
Absolutely,

672
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,748
但你我都知道,你是罪有应得 
But you and I both know you got exactly what you deserve,

673
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,378
丹尼斯 
Denise,

674
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,817
我希望他们不会认为我们是破门而入的 
I hope they don't think we're breaking in,

675
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,848
她不在家 
She's not home,

676
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,926
妈的 丹尼斯有个长得不错的女佣 
Damn, Denise got one fine-looking maid,

677
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,726
- 什么? - 埃尔...
-Excuse me? -Earl,,,

678
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,428
...那就是丹尼斯 嘿 
,,,that is Denise, Hey,

679
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,367
- 你想干什么,汉克? - 我只想谈谈 
-What do you want, Hank? -I only wanna talk,

680
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,804
- 你想谈谈? - 是的 
-Oh, you wanna talk? -Yeah,

681
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,844
是谈谈还是要说谎? 你知道两者是有区别的 
Or you wanna lie? Because there's a difference, you know,

682
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,278
- 我对你一直是诚实的  - 当然 
-I've always been honest with you, -Of course,

683
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:23,180
你只是忘了告诉我你吃午饭的时候揍了黑人 
You just forgot to tell me you were beating up black men on your lunch,

684
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,844
哈,她很风趣 
Oh, snap, She's witty,

685
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,253
是的,她总是占上风 
Yeah, She most definitely got the upper hand,

686
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,485
你能不能安静一会儿?谢谢 
Hey, could you be quiet for a minute? Thanks,

687
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,562
- 听着,我告诉你-- - 是的,我都知道了,不是你,是大黄蜂干的 
-Look, I told you how-- -Yeah, I know, the bumblebee did it,

688
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,631
- 是的  - 你说谎,亨利 
-Yeah, -You lied to me, Henry,

689
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,429
谎言,谎言 除了谎言还是谎言 
Lies, lies, Lies just compound lies,

690
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,368
你知道吗?但你总是说同样的事,请你继续 
You know? But you saying the same thing, Do your thing,

691
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,771
我谁也没揍,我能证明 
I didn't beat anybody, okay? And I can prove it,

692
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:52,643
这就是我被控告袭击的人,埃尔 
This is the man that I was accused of assaulting, Okay, Earl,

693
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,785
- 你好  - 你有什么要说的吗?
-Hi, -You got something you wanna say?

694
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,318
哦,是的 
Oh, yeah,

695
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,616
她是黑人,你从没告诉过我 
She's black, You never told me she was black,

696
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,558
我有没有袭击过你?
Did I or did I not assault you?

697
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,924
哦,他把我揍了个半死,女士 
Oh, he beat the hell out of me, ma'am,

698
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,089
- 什么? - 我可不会对我的姐妹撒谎 
-What? -I'm not gonna lie to the sister,

699
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,896
不,你这个狗娘养的! 我不会让你得逞的!
No, you're-- You son of a bitch! I'm not gonna take this!

700
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,505
你放开他,住手,滚出去 
Hey! Get your hands off him, Stop it, Get out,

701
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,265
- 出去! - 出去!滚出去!
-Get out! -Get out! Just get out!

702
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,706
- 亨利,滚出去! - 你也出去 滚!
-Henry, get out! -You too, Get out! Get!

703
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,072
- 可是-- - 滚!
-But-- -Get!

704
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,113
要是我出去的话,暴力就要升级了 
I think the violence might kick off out there,

705
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,308
滚出去 
Get out,

706
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,287
听着,伙计,等等  你为什么对我使这种下流手段?
Listen, man, Wait, Why you all salty at me, man?

707
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:38,451
听着,汉克,别嚷嚷了, 不是我的错,知道吗?
Look, Hank, kill that noise, man, Listen, it's not my fault, Okay?

708
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,721
- 你告诉我她是白人的  - 没有 
-You told me she was white, -I did not,

709
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,956
那你也没告诉我她是黑人 
Well, you didn't tell me she was black,

710
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,499
- 有什么区别吗? - 区别大了 
-What difference does it make? -A big difference,

711
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,729
听着,如果我说谎,告诉她你没揍我...
Look, if I had lied and told her that you didn't beat me up,,,

712
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,396
...我就是在原谅一种跨种族关系 
,,,I'd be condoning interracial relationships,

713
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,475
但这是我不能原谅的 
Which is something I do not condone,

714
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,874
好的,如果你三秒钟之内不从面前消失--
Okay, that's it, If you're not out of my face in three seconds--

715
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,675
你可不要威胁你的搭档 
Now, you don't wanna be threatening your partner,

716
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,985
我不是你的搭档!
I am not your partner!

717
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,281
我有搭档! 我甚至愿意为他挡枪子儿!
I had a partner! I would have taken a bullet for him!

718
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,822
而你,我正在克制自己不开枪杀了你!
You, I'm having a hard time not shooting!

719
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,723
好的,别动!就这样,你惹火我了 
All right, hold on! Now, that's it, Now I'm upset,

720
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,059
如果你要走,我就逮捕你 
If you leave, I'm gonna put your ass under citizen's arrest,

721
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,168
你我都知道,你直接违反了...
Okay? And you and I both know you are in direct violation,,,

722
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,327
...法定的限制令 
,,,of a legal, binding restraining order,

723
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,372
- 你牙齿上有个东西  - 哪儿?这儿还是这儿?
-You have something in your teeth, -Where? Here, or here?

724
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,940
现在你可以告诉别人我揍了你 
Now you can tell people I hit you,

725
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,958
- 嗨  - 嗨,78年款的普利毛斯沃来尔,棕色 
-Hi, -Hi, '78 Plymouth Volare, tan,

-Can I have your driver's license? -Yep,

727
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,772
你在和我开玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

728
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,782
我牙齿上有个东西?
I got something in my teeth?

729
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,386
我告诉你是什么,汉克  是我对你的信任,现在没有了 
I'll tell you what it was, Hank, Trust, And now it's gone,

730
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,045
埃尔,你要我做什么?
Earl, what do I have to do?

731
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,182
我是为我的小埃尔来的  没有他我哪儿也不去 
I just came to get Earl Jr, I don't go nowhere without my baby,

732
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,557
你为什么不带上你的破车, 然后我们分道扬镳 
So why don't you get your jalopy, and we go our separate ways,

733
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,096
我的车就在那儿,能把钥匙给我吗?
That's my car right over there, Could I have the keys?

734
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,735
我只是想看一下你的证件 
We're just trying to locate your paperwork, sir,

735
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,464
看啊,看啊,谁在这里啊?

740

你那些关于跨种族关系的狗屁哪里去了?
What was all that crap about interracial couples?

741
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:56,127
当男方是白人时,我坚决反对...
I am firmly and belligerently against any interracial coupling,,,

742
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,899

谢谢 
Thanks,

747
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:21,051

Get your stuff out of my car and get the hell out of here!

748
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:31,930

769
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,184
小心!
Watch out!

770
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,052
死路!死路!
Dead end! Dead end, dead end!

771
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,890
- 嘿! - 我看见了 
-Hey! -I see it,

772
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,707
想想看,你打我,我却没有杀了你 
Come to think of it, you hit me and I didn't kill you?

773
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,842
我救了你,让你活了下去 
I'm letting you live, saving your ass,

774
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,107
- 哦,我直奔天堂而去  - 栅栏!
-Oh, I'm going straight to heaven, -Fence!

775
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,375
放心,汉克 上帝保佑我呢 
Chill, Hank, I'm blessed,

776
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,620
这次你又要干什么,汉克?
What'd you do this time, Hank?

777
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,399
不知道,我想想 
I don't know, I'll find out,

778
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,092
作为一个警察,你麻烦大了 
For a cop, you sure get in a hell of a lot of trouble,

779
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,295
是的,是的 
Yeah, yeah,

780
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,099
在这里转弯 转弯,转弯!
Turn here, Turn, turn, turn!

781
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,346
嘿 在这里转弯,在这里转弯!
Hey, chopper, Turn here, turn here!

782
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,506
转弯!
Turn!

783
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,819
我总是喜欢洗车 
Always loved the car wash, man,

784
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:12,690
白色的泡沫水撒到你头顶上, 刷子在风中飞舞 
White, foamy water over you, Brushes waving in the breeze,

785
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:17,295
对于一个贫民区的孩子来说, 就像是在夏威夷 
When you a kid in the ghetto, that's like going to Hawaii,

786
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,163
- 他们已经通缉我们了  - 我们?我做什么了?
-They got an APB out on both of us, -Both of us? What the hell did I do?

787
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:24,500
你因为在文森特・托马斯大桥开火被通缉 
We're wanted for the shootout on the Vincent Thomas Bridge,

788
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,472
- 是的,很公平  - 不,没道理啊 
-Yeah, well, that's fair, -No, it doesn't make any sense,

789
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,268
警察怎么知道我们在桥上?
How'd the cops know we were on the bridge?

790
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,974
只有卡车里的家伙才认识我们, 但他们不会报警的 
Only the guys in the truck could lD us, and they wouldn't call it in,

791
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,616
也许是里面的人发通缉令想找到我们 
Maybe someone on the inside put out a APB to locate us,

792
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,551
一定是有坏警察 
Now we're talking about dirty cops,

793
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:48,027
- 你在干什么? - 查那面包车的牌照 
-What you doing? -Running the numbers on the van,

794
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,530
不,妈的,牌照是假的!
No, plates are phony, Damn it!

795
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
- 查一查车辆识别代码  - 什么?
-Check the VlN, -What?

796
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,602
- 我还以为都给刮掉了  - 下面的没有 
-I thought they were all scratched off, -Not underneath,

797
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,741
我启动货车时扯下来的 
I pulled it when I was wiring the van,

798
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,207
- 所有单位,5-0-3警车被偷  - 有了 好的,地址 
-All units, 5-0-3, stolen police vehicle. -Bingo, Address, Okay,

799
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,075
- 被盗警车在威尼斯和克伦莎洗过车  - 他们发现我们了 
-Car wash at Venice and Crenshaw. -They tracked us,

800
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,877
把车扔掉吧!
Let's ditch the car!

801
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,190
- 我们需要车  - 是的,是的 
-We need a car, -Yeah, yeah,

802
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,695
嘿,嘿!嘿,嘿!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

803
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,100
你能停车吗?
Hey, could you pull over here?

804
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,863
- 上帝! - 用警徽 
-God! -Use the badge,

805
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,733
- 什么? - 警徽 
-What? -Use the badge,

806
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,340
停下!国家保安!
Stop! National Security!

807
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,609
- 我要征用你的车! - 给我看看警徽 
-I'm commandeering this car! -Let's see the badge,

808
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,882
- 快出来  - 别对我大声嚷嚷 
-Just step out of the car, ma'am, -Don't you raise your voice at me,

809
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,518
快他妈的下车!
Get out of the damn car!

810
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,845
你妈没有教你懂礼貌吗?
Didn't your mama teach you any manners?

811
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,322
起码你可以对我客气点 
At least you could ask me nicely,

812
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,489
你这叫征用车辆?
You call this commandeering a car?

813
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,396
- 你给我闭嘴  - 别在我的车里说粗话 
-You wanna shut the hell up? -Don't be using that language in my car,

814
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,696
抱歉 
Sorry,

815
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,663
你们可以搭我的车 
Now, I got no problem giving you boys a ride,

816
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,708
但我可不乐意别人叫我离开我自己的车 
But I don't take kindly to being told to get out of my car,

817
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,607
不,长官,我当然不乐意 
No, sir, I surely do not,

818
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,612
搜查令 
Warrant,

819
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,807
一份搜查令 
A warrant,

820
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,612
他们要搜查仓库必须有搜查令 
They must've had a warrant to raid the warehouse,

821
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,152
坏警察要把他的人先放进去必须有搜查令 
The dirty cop had to have access to it to send his boys in first,

822
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,815
储藏库也是一样 
Same thing must've happened at the storage place,

823
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,961
- 谁泄漏的消息? - 我不知道 
-So who's the leak? -I don't know,

824
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,893
通缉令发给了所有观察员 
APB's go through watch commander,

825
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,556
华盛顿? 不是一直都这样的吗?
Washington? Ain't that how it always is?

826
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,100
- 什么? - 你黔驴技穷了...
-What? -You have nothing to go on,,,

827
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,170
...就开始指责黑人 
,,,and already you blaming the black man,

828
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,333
- 我只实话实说  - 我来告诉你们怎么发现坏警察 
-I'm just throwing names out, -I'll tell you how to find a dirty cop,

829
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,978
给警察局打电话 
Pick up the phone and call the police station,

830
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,341
别管谁接听 
Don't really matter who answers,

831
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,259
该说什么?
What you gonna say?

832
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,795
- 谢谢  - 谢谢 
-Thanks, -Thank you,

833
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:06,334
- 嗯,你们现在学好了  - 当然 
-Okay, you boys behave now, -No question,

834
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:10,202
- 保重  - 我该要她的电话吗?
-Take care, -Should I have gotten her number?

835
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:13,274
- 当然,她很不错  - 我也这么认为 
-Definitely, She's very nice, -I thought so too,

836
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,703
是这里吗?
Is this the place?

837
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,507
机灵点 
Stay cool,

838
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,082
你能开锁吗?
Can you pick this?

839
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:29,748
什么?“仅仅因为我是黑人,所以...”
What? "Just because I'm a black man,,,, What?"

840
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,759
你学得很像,但你为什么不这样 
You were doing good, But why you said like this:

841
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,296
黑人都这样,让身体随心所欲地动--
All black people don't do that, Look, man, Just let it flow--

842
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,696
能开锁吗?!
Can you pick the lock or not?

843
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:44,538
- 得有工具  - 嘿,嘿,来啊 
-Not without my tools, -Hey, hey, Come on,

844
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:49,334
这里很不错,是个监视的好地方 
This is great, A real stakeout,

845
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,810
我一辈子都想当警察 
My whole life, man, I wanted to be a cop,

846
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,677
自从我小时候在电视上看昆西以后 
Ever since I was a kid, watching Quincy on TV,

847
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,842
昆西是验尸官 
Quincy was a medical examiner,

848
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,719
哦,我想在这里,我们不会得到很好的招待 
Oh, I guess in the projects we didn't get real good reception,

849
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:10,424
伙计,很无聊,我们在这里多久了?
Hey, man, This is boring, How long we been here?

850
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:17,338
- 上来12分钟了  - 那些家伙到底去哪儿了?
-Coming up on 1 2 minutes, -Where the hell are these people?

851
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,238
埃尔,这是监视点,我们在这里也许要 坐上几个小时 
Earl, this is a stakeout, We could be sitting here for hours,

852
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,039
难怪警察都这么胖 
No wonder cops are so fat,

853
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,678
说啊 
Shoot,

854
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,045
查理怎么了?
Hey, whatever happened to Charlie?

855
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:40,192
如果你不介意,我现在不想谈 
If you don't mind, I'd just-- I'd rather not talk about it,

856
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,194
真的不?
You sure?

857
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,790
不 
Yeah,

858
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,872
他们就在我面前杀了他 
You know, they shot him right in front of me, man,

859
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,986
而我却无能为力 
I couldn't do a damn thing about it,

860
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,320
很抱歉,谁干的?
I'm sorry to hear that, man, Who did it?

861
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,289
我们要找的那些家伙 
The guys we're looking for,

862
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,264
看来是私人恩怨 
So that's why this is personal,

863
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,201
我来明说,他们杀了你搭档...
Let me get this straight, Your partner got killed,,,

864
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:30,005
...你丢了工作,被扔进监狱,女朋友又跑了...
,,,you lost your job, you got thrown in jail, your girlfriend walked,,,

865
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:35,947
...你现在只是一个每周挣182美元的保安?
,,,and now you're a security guard making 1 82 dollars a week?

866
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,212
知道你是什么人吗,汉克?
Know what you are, Hank?

867
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,685
你是个黑人了 
You're a black man,

868
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,493
你该好好琢磨琢磨,对吧?
Now, though, you gotta think about it though, right?

869
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,091
看到你笑了,我很高兴 
Glad to see you laugh, man,

870
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,701
- 我们在这儿多久了? - 哦,又来了 
-Now how long have we been here? -Oh, come on,

871
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:02,038
- 13分钟了  - 我去弄点吃的 
-Coming up on 1 3 minutes, -I got to get something to eat, man,

872
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,897
埃尔 
Earl,

873
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:30,061
嘿,埃尔 
Hey, Earl,

874
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,102
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

875
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,448
不!埃尔!
No! Earl!

876
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

877
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,322
埃尔,嘿 埃尔 
Earl, hey, Earl,

878
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,770
我们总早到,他们总迟到 
We're always early, He's always late,

879
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,913
妈的!
Damn it!

880
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:24,352
给我回话,在警察拘留所发现他们了 
Call me back. They were spotted at the police impound yard.

881
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,957
下去把货拿来 
Get down and get the goods.

882
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,263
讨厌的家伙!
Pain in the ass!

883
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,394
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

884
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,940
不,我有事,我中枪了 
Hell, no, I ain't okay, man, I been shot!

885
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,874
妈的 
Shit,

886
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,811
- 是他! - 你怎么知道?
-It's him! -How do you know?

887
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,677
纹身!
Tattoo!

888
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,343
婊子养的!
Son of a bitch!

889
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,386
搭档 
Partner,

890
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:30,958
去干了他 
Go get him,

891
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,439
- 汉克  - 嗯?
-Hank, -Yeah?

892
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,842
干掉了?
You get him?

893
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,212
没有 
No,

894
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,355
- 拜托  - 我不行了,汉克 
-Come on, -I ain't gonna make it, Hank,

895
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:04,892
我很冷,全身都冷 
I'm cold, man, I'm cold all over,

896
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,726
我开始看见白光了 
I'm starting to see white light,

897
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:11,056
妈的,连光都是白的了 
Damn, Even the light is white,

898
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,669
赶紧,你腿中枪了,萨利 我们走!
Come on, You got hit in the leg, Sally, Let's go!

916
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,257
埃尔?你没穿内裤 
Earl? You're not wearing any underwear,

917
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:14,459
我不喜欢穿内裤,让我觉得被约束 
I don't like to wear drawers, okay? Makes me feel constricted,

918
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,155

我还以为你要搞同性恋 
I thought you was trying to get a free ass shot,

927

- 能给片薯片吗? - 不行 
-Can I get a chip? -No,

958
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,576

能不能告诉他?

A year ago, over $7 million in atomic alloy was stolen out of Crupps,

972
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:10,029

To smuggle it out, they had to melt it down and recast it as beer kegs,

973
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,827

是的,我不知道我在想什么

I don't know who you're selling these things to,

987
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,448
我们只想分一份,比如说100万 
All we want is a piece of the pie, Say, $1 million worth,

你怎么找到这个地方的?
How'd you find this place?

991
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:40,987
我在这里做过几天保安,看管建筑设备 
I did a couple nights of security watching some construction equipment,

992
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,251

-It's perfect for us, though, -How many boys Washington got?

-You bring the metal, Hank? -You bring the money, Frank?

We'll see about that when I see the kegs,

1000
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,937
不谈钱了,你要的东西已经来了 
Let's just forget about the money, We already got what we came for,

1001
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:41,405
我想他们没你们想像得那么有用 
I don't think you'll find them as helpful as you thought they'd be,

1002

你的黑人兄弟和他们是一伙的?
The brother's in on it?

1007
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,169
他一定是在白人街区长大的

1017
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,955
趴下!怎么回事?
Down! Down! What the hell happened?
