1
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,513
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:35,726
So, what do you wanna
hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,394
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:41,357
- There's porno theaters for that.
- Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:47,655
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:51,742
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,870
Figure I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,414
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,333
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,001
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,920
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,548
All right.
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

13
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,594
- How's your driving record?
- It's clean.

14
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,972
It's real clean, like my conscience.

15
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,976
You gonna break my chops? I got
enough trouble with guys like you.

16
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:20,563
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches.

17
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,148
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,527
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,529
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,447
Education?

21
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,116
Some.

22
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:34,410
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,707
Military record?

24
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,126
Honorable discharge.

25
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,628
May 1973.

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,839
- Were you in the Army?
- Marines.

27
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,093
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,472
So, what is it?

29
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,766
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,269
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,273
Well, I...
I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:05,941
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,278
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,447
...when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,282
O'Brien, please step up.

36
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:16,035
Take the car out
through 58th Street, please.

37
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:18,078
Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,749
Hey, Rodriguez!

39
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:31,759
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

40
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,344
May 10th.

41
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,805
Thank God for the rain,
which has washed away...

42
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,308
...the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,103
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:28,107
Six in the afternoon to 6 in the morning,
sometimes even 8 in the morning.

45
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:31,443
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:34,571
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:37,032
I can take in $300,
$350 a week.

48
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,827
Sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.

49
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,271
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:12,526
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,696
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,287
Someday a real rain'll come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,257
I go all over. I take people to the
Bronx, Brooklyn. I take them to Harlem.

54
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,427
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:42,222
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,016
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,851
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.

58
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:50,147
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,943
I can't afford
to get stopped anywhere.

60
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,321
Oh, no.
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:01,241
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
you do the right things.

62
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,037
You got a way.

63
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,707
Yeah. Now you're talking!

64
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:11,418
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,125
Each night when I return the cab...

66
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,169
...I have to clean the come
off the back seat.

67
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,468
Some nights, I clean off the blood.

68
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,336
Can I help you?

69
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,589
Yeah, what's your name?

70
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,174
My name is Travis.

71
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,177
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

72
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,222
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

73
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,474
Give me a break.

74
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:53,604
Look, you can tell me what your
name is. I'm not gonna do anything.

75
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:57,441
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to call the manager.

76
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:01,111
- Troy!
- All right. Okay, I mean...

77
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:05,490
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?

78
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:10,787
And do you have any Jujubes? They
last longer. I'd like to get some Jujubes.

79
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,207
What you see is what we got.

80
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,880
A Clark.

81
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,842
I'll take these.

82
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:27,679
Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,767
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

84
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:35,103
A dollar eighty-five.

85
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:00,545
Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.

86
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,673
Damn.

87
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:06,969
The days go on and on.
And they don't end.

88
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:11,848
All my life needed was
a sense of some place to go.

89
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,436
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

90
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:19,982
I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.

91
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:27,281
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

92
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:31,243
She was wearing a white dress.

93
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,912
She appeared like an angel...

94
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:37,040
...out of this filthy mass.

95
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,126
She is alone.

96
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:41,837
They...

97
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:43,714
...cannot...

98
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,590
...touch...

99
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,676
...her.

100
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,065
Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes.

101
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,027
I think it's a total
of 5000 campaign buttons.

102
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,572
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is:

103
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:11,491
"We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

104
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,202
These new buttons
have "we" underlined.

105
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:18,999
That reads, "We are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

106
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,128
"We are the people" is not
the same as "We are the people."

107
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:25,422
Let's not fight.

108
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,342
Look, we'll make it real simple.

109
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,677
We don't pay for the buttons.

110
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:35,223
- We throw the buttons away, all right?
- Tom, come here a minute.

111
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,143
What?

112
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:45,859
What is it?

113
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:50,447
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

114
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,949
I gotta get that New York Times article
xeroxed.

115
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,702
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget.

116
00:11:55,912 --> 00:12:00,165
We have to emphasize mandatory
welfare. That's the issue to push.

117
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,250
First push the man, then the issue.

118
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,461
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

119
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,714
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

120
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,091
You forgot sexy.

121
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,675
I did not forget sexy.

122
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,512
Listen to you. You sound
like you're selling mouthwash.

123
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,888
We are selling mouthwash.

124
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,057
- Are we authorized to do that?
- Very funny.

125
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:20,477
You can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

126
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:23,188
My uncle's in jail because of that.

127
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:27,526
It's not really jail. Of course, living
with his wife, anything would be jail.

128
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,027
Look over there.

129
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,487
I love you.

130
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,822
Notice anything?

131
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,241
- No.
- Well, put your glasses on.

132
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:37,035
Okay, just a minute. All right.

133
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,538
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

134
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,090
What taxi driver?

135
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,426
That one, the one that's sitting there.

136
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:56,012
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know. It feels like a long time.

137
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,057
- Does he bother you?
- No.

138
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,351
You mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

139
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,437
Oh, you're quick.
You're really quick.

140
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,188
Well, I try to be real quick.

141
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,649
I'll play the male
in this relationship...

142
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,109
Good luck.

143
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,654
- And tell him to move. And I don't
need good luck. Thank you.

144
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,615
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

145
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:27,627
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

146
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,064
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

147
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,774
...lipstick, rouge.

148
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:15,860
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

149
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,448
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

150
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,326
Travis.

151
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:27,330
- Hey, Wiz.
- That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

152
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,624
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

153
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,252
A cup of coffee, please.

154
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:35,255
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it.

155
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,882
And then perfume. The spray kind.

156
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,594
Get this. In the middle
of the Triborough Bridge...

157
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:44,014
And this woman is beautiful.
- She changes her pantyhose.

158
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,515
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,810
- What'd you do?
- I throw the meter, you know...

160
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:53,398
...and I jump in the back seat and whip
it out. I said, "You know what this is?"

161
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,401
She says, "It's love."
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

162
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,236
She goes wild and she said:

163
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,156
"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

164
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:04,909
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

165
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,413
Travis, you know Doughboy,
Charlie T?

166
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:12,834
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickel?

167
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,420
Doughboy'll do anything for a buck.

168
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,674
So how's it hanging?

169
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,305
What's that?

170
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:32,187
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

171
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,480
Stickup?

172
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:37,400
No, he got cut up by some
crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

173
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,237
- Where?
- It was at 122nd Street.

174
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:43,823
Fucking Mau Mau land.

175
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:50,121
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

176
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:53,583
Travis?

177
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,339
Travis.

178
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,509
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:05,053
You handle some
pretty rough customers, huh?

180
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:06,805
Yeah, I have.

181
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,266
- You carry a piece?
- No.

182
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,560
- You need one?
- No.

183
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:15,980
I know a fella who can get you
a real nice deal.

184
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,066
There's lots of shit around.

185
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,735
I never use mine.
I'm conservative, you know.

186
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:24,823
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

187
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,086
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

188
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:40,964
Travis.

189
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:43,717
Look.

190
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:47,053
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

191
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:49,180
Dig the symbols.

192
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:53,226
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

193
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:56,229
And the watermark.

194
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,148
There's one person...

195
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,024
...there's two persons...

196
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,735
...and there's three persons.

197
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:04,154
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

198
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,614
Why don't you take it,
and if you can sell it...

199
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:10,618
...you give me half of what you got.
- I don't want to.

200
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:13,538
Hey, I'm gonna get in my cab
and boogie.

201
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,972
- Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
- Well...

202
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:35,018
- Nothing.
- That's very cute. Thank you.

203
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,103
Hey, you wanna see something?

204
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:40,857
Wait, I just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

205
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:43,860
- What?
- If you had...

206
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:46,321
...these three fingers
missing on this hand...

207
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,782
...and that hand missing
on that hand...

208
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,660
...how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't.

209
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:55,038
Go ahead. Give it a try.

210
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, I don't think I could do it.

211
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,502
No?

212
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,378
It's gonna be difficult.

213
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:04,422
I'll give it a try.

214
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:15,266
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

215
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,977
Just a minute.

216
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,028
I can't do it.

217
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,280
The guy at the newsstand can do it.

218
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,533
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

219
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,786
- Anyway, he's probably Italian.
- No.

220
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:36,579
- You're sure?
- He's black.

221
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,124
If he had been Italian, he might've been
a thief. The mob does that.

222
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:43,962
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

223
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,714
This sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

224
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:50,093
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

225
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:53,596
- It's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

226
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:56,516
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

227
00:19:56,725 --> 00:20:00,603
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a pet store...

228
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,606
...boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

229
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:33,928
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you right over here.

230
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,806
I'd rather volunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

231
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,896
Why do you feel
you have to volunteer to me?

232
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:47,233
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

233
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,029
Thanks.

234
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,489
But what do you think of Palantine?

235
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,703
Well, I...

236
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,165
Palantine, the man you're volunteering
to help elect president.

237
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,585
I'm sure he'll make a good president.

238
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:09,172
I don't know what his policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

239
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:13,259
- You wanna canvass?
- Yeah, I'll canvass.

240
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:16,054
How do you feel about
the senator's stand on welfare?

241
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:20,725
I don't really know his stand on
welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

242
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,853
- You're sure of that?
- Yeah.

243
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,524
We all work together here,
day and night...

244
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:31,903
...so I'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

245
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:36,658
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

246
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,035
...to work in the day.

247
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,288
Then what exactly do you want?

248
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:45,249
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

249
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,709
Why?

250
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,128
- Why? I'll tell you why.
- Yeah.

251
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:52,423
I think you're a lonely person.

252
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,259
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

253
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,470
I see a lot of people around you...

254
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,765
...and I see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

255
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:02,308
...that means nothing.

256
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,644
And when I came inside and met you...

257
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:07,605
...I saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself...

258
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,024
...that you're not a happy person.

259
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:12,402
And I think you need something.

260
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,488
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

261
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,784
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

262
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,168
What do you say?

263
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,010
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

264
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:44,976
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

265
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,894
I'm there to protect you.

266
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,236
Come on. Just take a little break.

267
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:00,491
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

268
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:02,744
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

269
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,872
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

270
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,000
- All right, 4 p.m.
- Right.

271
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,044
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

272
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,462
Okay.

273
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:15,089
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

274
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,925
Travis.

275
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,678
I appreciate this, Betsy.

276
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,612
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

277
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:41,741
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

278
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:47,371
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

279
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,832
I think that was a good selection.

280
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,376
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

281
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,504
She could've had
anything she wanted.

282
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:57,423
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

283
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:59,467
But the organizational problems.

284
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:04,597
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

285
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:09,894
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my possessions.

286
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:14,524
I should get one of those signs: "One
of these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

287
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,400
You mean "organized"?

288
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,486
Organiz-ized.

289
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:21,155
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

290
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:24,617
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

291
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:29,122
You mean "organiz-ize." Like those
little signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

292
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:36,712
Do you like where you work?

293
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:42,051
We've got some good people. And
I think Palantine's got a good chance.

294
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,266
You know you have beautiful eyes?

295
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:56,941
Do you like the guy you work with?

296
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,776
He's okay.

297
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,029
Yeah, I know.
But do you like him?

298
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:06,993
He's funny, good at his job. He's okay.
Though he does have a few problems.

299
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,370
I would say
he has quite a few problems.

300
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:14,167
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

301
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:17,587
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

302
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:20,673
...I could just tell
that there was no connection...

303
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,258
...whatsoever.

304
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:25,720
And I felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

305
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,639
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

306
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:31,559
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

307
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:35,521
Otherwise, I never would've felt
that I had the right to talk to you.

308
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:38,733
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

309
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,111
And with him,
I felt there was nothing.

310
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,406
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

311
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:51,287
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

312
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:54,874
Where are you from?

313
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:56,584
Upstate.

314
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:02,298
That fellow, I don't like him.

315
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,509
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

316
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,223
I don't think he respects you.

317
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,477
I don't believe I've ever met
anyone quite like you.

318
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:27,531
You wanna go to...

319
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,534
...a movie with me?

320
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:35,039
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now. Another time?

321
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:44,006
Sure.
You know what you remind me of?

322
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:47,343
- What?
- That song...

323
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:51,597
...by Kris Kristofferson.

324
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:57,186
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

325
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:58,938
"He's a prophet...

326
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,898
He's a prophet and a pusher...

327
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:05,152
...partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

328
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:08,239
You saying that about me?

329
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,157
Who else would I be talking about?

330
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,451
I'm no pusher.
I've never pushed.

331
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,372
No, just the part
about the contradictions.

332
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:18,416
You are that.

333
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:52,825
I called Betsy again at her office.
She said maybe we'd go to a movie...

334
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:55,953
...after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

335
00:27:56,204 --> 00:28:00,333
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

336
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:03,502
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

337
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:06,422
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

338
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,925
Damn! I gotta remember
stuff like that.

339
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,773
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

340
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,650
...until things start coming in
from California.

341
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:29,779
Listen, I think we should've
waited for the limo.

342
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,781
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

343
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:35,785
...going to California without the right
preparation. That'll get us in trouble.

344
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:38,037
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

345
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,665
Yes, I am.

346
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,293
I'm a big supporter.

347
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:47,963
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you.

348
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:49,757
Why, thank you...

349
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:52,885
...Travis.

350
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:56,013
I'm sure you'll win.
Everybody I know's gonna vote for you.

351
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,641
I was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi...

352
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:01,769
...but the company said
it was against their policy.

353
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:03,604
They're a bunch ofjerks.

354
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,649
Let me tell you, I have learned
more about America...

355
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:10,069
...from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country.

356
00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:14,782
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

357
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:17,827
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

358
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,205
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

359
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:27,711
Well, I don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

360
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,423
Oh, well, there must be something.

361
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:34,802
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

362
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:39,515
...because this city here's like an
open sewer. It's full of filth and scum.

363
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,809
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

364
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,020
Whatever ever becomes the president
should just...

365
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,773
...really clean it up.
Know what I mean?

366
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:51,652
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

367
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,947
And they just like... They just
never go away, you know?

368
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:57,533
I think that the president
should just...

369
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:02,538
...clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

370
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,174
Well, I think I know
what you mean, Travis.

371
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:15,426
But it's not gonna be easy.

372
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:19,096
- We'll have to make radical changes.
- Damn straight.

373
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,516
Here you go, Travis.
Keep the change.

374
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:24,018
Thank you.

375
00:30:27,522 --> 00:30:29,565
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

376
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,151
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

377
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,361
Thank you. Drive safe.

378
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:59,470
Come on, man.
Get me out of here, all right?

379
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,683
Come on!

380
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:07,186
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.

381
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:10,022
Now, come on!
Come on, don't make no scene.

382
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,108
You wanna get busted?

383
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:14,610
Now, bitch, be cool!

384
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:25,579
Don't start no trouble.

385
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,749
Cabbie, forget about this.
It's nothing.

386
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,209
Be cool, bitch!

387
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:42,471
- Stop!
- Wanna hear something?

388
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,020
What's the matter, baby?

389
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:26,390
Get your ass out of here!

390
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:37,836
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

391
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:41,340
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

392
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:43,217
I got a present for you.

393
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:51,141
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

394
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,526
Why'd you do that?

395
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:03,654
What else am I gonna do
with my money?

396
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,156
I wish you'd have listened to this.

397
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:09,743
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

398
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,203
Your stereo's broken?

399
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:13,872
How can you stand it?
I can't live without music.

400
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:17,751
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

401
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:19,878
Then you haven't played
this record yet?

402
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:21,547
No.

403
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:27,052
But I was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

404
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:30,973
Now, going back to
40 years of Chick Webb.

405
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:48,741
You gotta be kidding.

406
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,244
- What?
- This is a dirty movie.

407
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,665
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

408
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:00,794
- All kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?

409
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,714
Yeah, I see them all the time.

410
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,093
Come on.

411
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,302
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,763
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

413
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,265
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

414
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,768
- I don't like these movies.
- Well, I mean...

415
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,896
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

416
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:04,024
- If I had known...
- These the only movies you go to?

417
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:07,236
Yeah, I mean I come and...
This is not so bad.

418
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:11,281
Taking me to a place like this is as
exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

419
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:18,288
There are other places
I can take you.

420
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:21,625
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other places.

421
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,627
We're just different.

422
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,421
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

423
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,840
- I've gotta go now.
- Wait.

424
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:31,677
- Wait a second, I wanna talk to you.
- Look, I have to go.

425
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:33,387
Taxi!

426
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:37,766
Can I talk to you at least? Won't you at
least talk to me? I didn't know you'd...

427
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,309
Won't you take the record?

428
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,854
- I've already got it.
- But, please.

429
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:46,066
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Now I've got two. Let's go.

430
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:47,985
Can I call you?

431
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:51,321
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

432
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:58,787
Hello, Betsy.

433
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:00,706
Hi, it's Travis.

434
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:05,544
How you doing? Listen,
I'm sorry about the other night.

435
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:08,839
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

436
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:15,721
Well, I didn't know. If I... I would
have taken you somewhere else.

437
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,057
Are you feeling better or?

438
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,645
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

439
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:26,148
It can happen. Yeah.

440
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:33,447
You've been working hard, huh?
Yeah.

441
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:40,787
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

442
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,665
...in the next few days or something?

443
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:48,295
How about just a cup of coffee?

444
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:52,633
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could...

445
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,344
Okay, okay.

446
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:00,557
Did you get my flowers in the?

447
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:06,813
You didn't get them?
But I sent some flowers.

448
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:13,111
Yeah. Well... Okay, okay.

449
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:15,364
Can I call you again?

450
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:18,325
Tomorrow or the next day?
Okay.

451
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:21,411
No, I'm gonna...
Okay, yeah, sure. Okay.

452
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:23,080
So long.

453
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,334
I tried several times to call her...

454
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:31,421
...but after the first call, she wouldn't
come to the phone any longer.

455
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:34,257
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

456
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:37,094
The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.

457
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:41,848
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.

458
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,559
I shouldn't complain, though.

459
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,062
You're only as healthy...

460
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,399
You're only as healthy as you feel.

461
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:53,110
You're only...

462
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,028
...as healthy...

463
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,655
...as...

464
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:58,448
...you...

465
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,033
...feel.

466
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,006
- Let's not have any trouble, okay?
- Why won't you talk to me?

467
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:16,675
You think I don't know you're here?

468
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:18,927
You think I don't know?

469
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:20,804
- Please leave.
- Take your hands off!

470
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:23,181
I just want you to know...

471
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,851
Please, just leave.
This is no place to do this.

472
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,144
Take your hands off me.

473
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,021
- Take your hands off!
- Just leave.

474
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:32,357
- All right, just leave, then.
- I'm gonna tell you...

475
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,193
...you're in a hell!
You'll die in hell like the rest.

476
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:38,155
- Come on. There's a cop.
- You're like the rest of them.

477
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,699
Look, I'm calling the cop.
Officer!

478
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,078
Officer!

479
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:50,042
Look, don't come around here,
because I'll call the police!

480
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,964
I realize now how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

481
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:57,841
And many people are like that.

482
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:01,344
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

483
00:40:02,638 --> 00:40:04,097
Yo, cab!

484
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:15,776
Okay, pull over to the curb over there.
Right over to the curb. Over there.

485
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,863
No, no, don't... Don't... Don't...

486
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,449
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

487
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,826
What are you doing with the meter?

488
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:28,205
Did I tell you to put...?
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

489
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,457
Put the meter back.
Let the numbers go on.

490
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,334
I don't care what I have to pay.

491
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:36,171
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

492
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:37,380
Put it down.

493
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,760
Put it... That's right.
Put it... Put it down!

494
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:44,888
That's right.

495
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:48,266
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

496
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:49,976
Put the thing down. Just sit.

497
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:56,566
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over."

498
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:59,277
We pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

499
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:02,864
We're gonna sit.

500
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:25,554
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

501
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:29,391
The light?
The window in the second floor.

502
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:35,981
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

503
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:40,569
The light up in the window.
Second story.

504
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,947
What are you, blind?

505
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:45,782
Do you see the light?

506
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,536
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

507
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:52,831
You see the woman?

508
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:58,170
Do you see the woman in the window?

509
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:03,341
- Yeah.
- You see the woman. Good.

510
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:06,428
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

511
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,807
But that's not my apartment.

512
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:16,438
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there, huh?

513
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,026
No, I mean, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

514
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:23,945
A nigger lives there.

515
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:26,031
How do you like that?

516
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:35,207
And I'm g... I'm gonna kill her.

517
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:40,295
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

518
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,505
Well, what do you think of that?

519
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:46,468
I said, what do you think of that?

520
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,386
Don't answer.

521
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:50,847
You don't have to answer everything.

522
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:57,771
I'm gonna kill her
with a.44 Magnum pistol.

523
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:02,525
I have a.44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

524
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:06,529
Did you ever see what a.44 Magnum
pistol can do to a woman's face?

525
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:10,659
I mean, it'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

526
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,161
That's what it can do to her face.

527
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:16,623
Did you ever see what it can do to
a woman's pussy? You should.

528
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:21,711
You should see what a.44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

529
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:30,011
What's that?

530
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:33,181
I know you must think
that I'm, you know...

531
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:37,143
You must think
I'm pretty sick or something.

532
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,522
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

533
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:48,196
Right? I bet you really
think I'm sick, right?

534
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:56,746
You think I'm sick?

535
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:03,461
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

536
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,382
I picked up this midget, you know.

537
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:10,135
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

538
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,804
...good-looking,
with a beautiful tall blonde.

539
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:15,557
- Was it a lady midget?
- No, the guy was a midget.

540
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:18,059
- The blonde was a lady.
- I got you.

541
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,312
Those midgets are funny.

542
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:23,648
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

543
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,651
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

544
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:32,157
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

545
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:38,496
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

546
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:41,708
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

547
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:44,419
I say, "I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

548
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,005
...of your own home,
behind closed doors.

549
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:48,923
This is an American free country.

550
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:53,720
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

551
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:58,516
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

552
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:01,936
- God loves you, do what you want."
- Tell them to go to California.

553
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:06,816
In California, when two fags split up,
one's gotta pay the other one alimony.

554
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:13,031
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

555
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,158
So I tell them to get out of the cab.

556
00:45:15,368 --> 00:45:17,994
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

557
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:21,331
- He was on crutches, you know.
- The cop?

558
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,834
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

559
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:28,505
- Hey, Travis.
- Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

560
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,927
My man is loaded. Loaded.

561
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:38,807
I'd be broke if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.

562
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:43,144
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

563
00:45:43,396 --> 00:45:45,397
What's the action around?

564
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:47,190
It's pretty slow.

565
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:49,776
I'm shoving on.

566
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,320
Hey, Wiz, wait.

567
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:56,574
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Bye, Killer.

568
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,704
Thank you. Night.

569
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:19,097
- You put it down.
- You can have them all you want!

570
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:21,683
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

571
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:25,979
You better take your ass out, boy!

572
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:31,943
Yeah?

573
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:34,612
I know you and I ain't talked
too much, you know.

574
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,699
But I figure you've been around a lot,
so you could...

575
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,410
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

576
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,911
I got...

577
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:46,624
It's just that I got a... I got a...

578
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,084
Things got you down?

579
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:51,337
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

580
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:55,049
Yeah, they got me real down.
Real...

581
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:02,140
I just wanna go out...

582
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:06,519
...and you know, like, really...
Really... Really do something.

583
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:10,482
Taxi life, you mean?

584
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:14,027
Yeah, well...

585
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,112
No, it's...

586
00:47:17,364 --> 00:47:18,615
I don't know.

587
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,994
I just wanna go out...

588
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,663
I really...

589
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,249
I really wanna...

590
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:31,544
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just...

591
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,798
Look. Look at it this way.

592
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,929
A man...
A man takes a job, you know.

593
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,056
And that job...

594
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:47,602
...you know, that becomes what he is.

595
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:49,687
You know, like...

596
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:53,858
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

597
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:58,905
I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.

598
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:01,991
And I still don't own my own cab,
you know. Why?

599
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:06,955
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

600
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,333
You know, to be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

601
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,210
You understand?

602
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:16,214
You get a job, you become the job.

603
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:19,968
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

604
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:22,679
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

605
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,015
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

606
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:28,017
...and people are born.

607
00:48:28,227 --> 00:48:30,353
I envy you, your youth.

608
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,983
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. You know, do anything.

609
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:40,613
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

610
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:44,534
More or less, you know?

611
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:52,458
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

612
00:48:54,086 --> 00:48:57,297
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

613
00:48:57,464 --> 00:48:58,756
What do I know?

614
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:01,843
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

615
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,345
Maybe I don't know either.

616
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:10,226
Don't worry so much. Relax,
Killer, you're gonna be all right.

617
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:13,354
I know.
I've seen a lot of people...

618
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:16,733
...and I know.
- Okay.

619
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,318
Okay. Thanks, man.

620
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:21,863
I'll see you. I guess...

621
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,285
Yeah, you know. You're all right.
You're all right.

622
00:49:45,304 --> 00:49:49,766
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

623
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:51,559
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

624
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:55,104
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

625
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,899
...to our opponent
in the other party.

626
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:01,736
I think that my programs
are better defined than his.

627
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:05,657
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

628
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:08,701
It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.

629
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:10,662
I see.

630
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:14,248
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

631
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,709
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

632
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,088
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

633
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,590
...when I said
"Let the people rule"...

634
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,677
...I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.

635
00:50:25,928 --> 00:50:29,472
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

636
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:33,601
The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.

637
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:36,270
The people are beginning to rule.

638
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,107
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

639
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:42,276
...it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

640
00:50:42,444 --> 00:50:45,238
And I know it will rise...

641
00:50:45,447 --> 00:50:48,157
...to an unprecedented swell
in November.

642
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:16,662
That bitch, goddamn!
I'll blow her brains out!

643
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:21,042
I'll kill her, goddamn it! I'm gonna
get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

644
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,543
Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!

645
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:26,464
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

646
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,759
- Hey, Sport.
- Hey, Sport.

647
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,136
I'll kill her! Damn it!

648
00:52:32,304 --> 00:52:35,389
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

649
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:53,115
Hey, guys.

650
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:58,621
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

651
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:14,303
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

652
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,098
In bars, in cars...

653
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,976
...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

654
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:22,520
There's no escape.

655
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,439
I'm God's lonely man.

656
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,112
June 8th.

657
00:53:31,613 --> 00:53:34,031
My life has taken another turn again.

658
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:37,743
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

659
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:40,496
...one day indistinguishable
from the next.

660
00:53:40,747 --> 00:53:43,207
A long, continuous chain.

661
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:45,251
And then suddenly...

662
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,545
...there is change.

663
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:05,062
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

664
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:07,356
How you doing, Travis?

665
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:32,798
- You got a.44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

666
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:35,051
That's all right. I got money.

667
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,969
It's a real monster.

668
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:41,766
Stop a car at 100 yards, put a round
right through the engine block.

669
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:54,487
Here you go.

670
00:54:54,947 --> 00:54:57,531
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

671
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:03,245
Look at that.

672
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:06,582
Look at that. That's a beauty.

673
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,799
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

674
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:19,095
But I just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

675
00:55:20,305 --> 00:55:21,597
How about that?

676
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:24,976
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

677
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,436
In which case,
for you, I'd recommend...

678
00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:29,647
...38 snub-nosed.

679
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:33,067
Look at this.

680
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,738
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.

681
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:40,157
It's nickel-plated with a snub-nose...

682
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,785
...otherwise the same
as a service revolver.

683
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:45,246
That'll stop anything that moves.

684
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:48,833
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

685
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:52,253
That.38, that's a funny gun.

686
00:55:57,342 --> 00:55:59,593
Some of these guns are like toys.

687
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:02,930
That.38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

688
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,434
...come back and it'll cut
dead center on target every time.

689
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:10,604
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

690
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:15,026
You interested in an automatic?

691
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:19,363
It's a Colt.25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

692
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:20,781
It's a beautiful gun.

693
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,576
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

694
00:56:23,785 --> 00:56:25,870
If you're dumb enough
to put a round there.

695
00:56:27,372 --> 00:56:29,790
Here. Look at this.

696
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,500
.380 Walther.

697
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:33,961
Holds eight shots in the clip.

698
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:37,089
That's a nice gun.

699
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,800
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

700
00:56:43,221 --> 00:56:47,516
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

701
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,561
Just given out to officers.

702
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:58,360
Ain't that a little honey?

703
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,122
- How much for everything?
- All together?

704
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:14,418
Well, only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

705
00:57:15,504 --> 00:57:19,006
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

706
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:21,092
Forty dollars.

707
00:57:21,843 --> 00:57:24,845
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the.38...

708
00:57:25,013 --> 00:57:28,641
...one and a quarter for the.25,
150 for the.380.

709
00:57:29,017 --> 00:57:32,061
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

710
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:35,940
How about dope? Grass?
Hash? Coke?

711
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:40,111
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

712
00:57:40,362 --> 00:57:43,864
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- No, I'm not interested in that stuff.

713
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:46,742
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

714
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:49,370
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

715
00:57:49,704 --> 00:57:51,413
...with the pink slip, two grand.

716
00:58:00,048 --> 00:58:01,549
June 29th.

717
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:05,511
I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.

718
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:08,264
Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.

719
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:10,933
From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.

720
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:14,270
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.

721
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:18,649
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

722
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:22,945
From now on, it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.

723
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:45,050
Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

724
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:47,428
Oh, it looks so good.

725
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:57,229
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

726
00:58:58,773 --> 00:59:02,776
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

727
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,112
True force.

728
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:09,950
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

729
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:14,408
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.

730
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:16,785
All the way back there?

731
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:18,203
- Come on.
- They'll work.

732
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:21,123
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- I've done this 100 times.

733
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:23,625
- You've done this before?
- Yes, don't worry.

734
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:26,754
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.

735
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:28,464
Betsy!

736
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,883
- Betsy!
- What?!

737
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:34,636
Betsy. Come here, come here.

738
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:30,526
Hey.

739
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:35,322
Hey, you're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

740
01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:39,493
Just waiting for the senator.

741
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,663
You're waiting for the senator?

742
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:48,710
That's a very good answer.

743
01:02:48,962 --> 01:02:51,171
Shit, man.

744
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:55,759
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

745
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:59,930
No, the reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

746
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:01,723
I won't say anything.

747
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:03,475
- Is because I...

748
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,773
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

749
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:12,192
- You did?
- They were right over there.

750
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:19,950
They were just here.

751
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:25,456
They were very, very...

752
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:28,041
- Suspicious.
- Yeah.

753
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:33,046
Where'd he go?

754
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:36,049
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

755
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:37,301
Why?

756
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:40,429
Well, I was just curious,
because I think I'd be good at it.

757
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:42,473
I'm very observant.

758
01:03:42,724 --> 01:03:45,392
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

759
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:47,728
I'm good with crowds.

760
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:53,567
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

761
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:54,860
Sort of.

762
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:59,156
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

763
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,578
Hey, what kind of guns
you guys carry?

764
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,833
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

765
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:14,796
Look, if you're really interested, if
you give me your name and address...

766
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:18,550
...we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

767
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:22,221
- You will?
- Sure.

768
01:04:22,388 --> 01:04:23,931
Okay.

769
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,849
Why not?

770
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:31,271
My name is Henry...

771
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:35,651
...Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

772
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:42,950
154 Hopper Avenue.

773
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:45,285
- "Hopper"?
- Yeah.

774
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,290
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

775
01:04:53,294 --> 01:04:55,295
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

776
01:04:58,049 --> 01:04:59,132
Is there a zip code?

777
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:02,344
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

778
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:08,350
- Okay?
- That's six digits. 6, 1...

779
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:12,521
Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5.

780
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:14,815
Okay.

781
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:18,110
I was thinking of
my telephone number.

782
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:19,444
Well, I've got it all.

783
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:22,406
Henry, we'll get all the stuff
right out to you.

784
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:26,118
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

785
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:28,161
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

786
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:32,583
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

787
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:42,217
Damn it!

788
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:05,991
Yeah.

789
01:06:09,996 --> 01:06:13,248
I'm faster than you,
you fucking sick...

790
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,168
I saw you coming, you fuck.

791
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:18,045
Shitheel!

792
01:06:21,466 --> 01:06:24,384
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

793
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:26,261
You make the move.

794
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:28,388
It's your move.

795
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,644
Don't try it, you fuck.

796
01:06:40,193 --> 01:06:49,910
You talking to me?

797
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:55,540
Well, then who the hell else are you
talking to? You talking to me?

798
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:58,043
Well, I'm the only one here.

799
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:03,256
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

800
01:07:03,549 --> 01:07:05,133
Oh, yeah?

801
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,929
Okay.

802
01:07:16,229 --> 01:07:18,605
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

803
01:07:18,815 --> 01:07:21,358
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

804
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,735
Who would not let...

805
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:26,822
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

806
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:30,492
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

807
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:32,786
A man who stood up
against the scum...

808
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:35,372
...the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

809
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,625
Here is someone who stood up.

810
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:46,967
You're dead.

811
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:15,203
Hey, Travis.

812
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,080
Hi, Melio.

813
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:29,426
Yeah, man?

814
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:33,764
Okay, shut your fucking mouth and give
me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

815
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:36,808
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
- Don't shoot.

816
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:39,227
Stop taking so long. Come on!

817
01:08:39,437 --> 01:08:41,897
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

818
01:08:42,106 --> 01:08:43,690
- This all you got?
- That's it.

819
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:46,193
I don't have any more money, man.

820
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:48,195
- That's all I got!
- You got more.

821
01:08:48,446 --> 01:08:51,448
- I tell you, I got no money!
- Reach in your sock.

822
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:53,617
- Give me the rest of the bread.
- Hey. Hey.

823
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:01,583
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

824
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:08,548
Shit, man.

825
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:13,303
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

826
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:22,813
I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

827
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:29,319
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

828
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:32,405
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man, just get out of here.

829
01:09:32,657 --> 01:09:35,158
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

830
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:41,832
The fifth motherfucker this year!

831
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:30,106
Walt Whitman, that great
American poet...

832
01:11:30,358 --> 01:11:32,359
...spoke for all of us when he said:

833
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:35,362
"I am the man. I suffered.

834
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:38,740
I was there."
Today I say to you:

835
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:42,369
We are the people. We suffered.

836
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,871
We were there.

837
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,377
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

838
01:11:50,962 --> 01:11:53,713
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

839
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:56,716
...from unemployment, inflation...

840
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,969
...crime and corruption.

841
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,182
Dear Father and Mother...

842
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:06,726
...July is the month I remember...

843
01:12:06,894 --> 01:12:10,146
...which brings not only
your wedding anniversary...

844
01:12:10,356 --> 01:12:13,566
...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

845
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:16,695
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

846
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:20,907
...but I hope this card
will take care of them all.

847
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,327
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

848
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:26,997
...like I promised to last year.

849
01:12:27,164 --> 01:12:30,000
But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government...

850
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:32,419
...demands utmost secrecy.

851
01:12:33,004 --> 01:12:35,755
I know you will understand.

852
01:12:36,674 --> 01:12:39,092
I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.

853
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,594
I've been going with a girl
for several months...

854
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:44,431
...and I know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

855
01:12:45,016 --> 01:12:48,768
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.

856
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:51,312
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

857
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:56,401
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

858
01:12:58,612 --> 01:13:02,240
- Bear the burden of suffering
for the few.

859
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,785
No more will we fight the wars
of the few...

860
01:13:05,953 --> 01:13:08,288
...through the heart of the many.

861
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:16,212
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

862
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:19,799
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

863
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:23,428
One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.

864
01:13:24,221 --> 01:13:26,222
Love, Travis.

865
01:13:32,938 --> 01:13:34,647
Don't you have some idea?

866
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:36,649
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

867
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:40,904
But you must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

868
01:13:41,113 --> 01:13:44,991
...is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

869
01:13:47,661 --> 01:13:51,122
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

870
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:57,295
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

871
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:02,675
I do love him.

872
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:08,348
What about us, June?

873
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:11,684
Our marriage?

874
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,481
You gotta know
our marriage wasn't legal.

875
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,818
In the eyes of God, we are married.

876
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:26,324
Brock, please don't do this to me.

877
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:29,828
I love him so...

878
01:14:39,046 --> 01:14:40,672
Damn.

879
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,217
Goddamn!

880
01:15:18,711 --> 01:15:20,753
They trying to get in the picture.

881
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,594
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

882
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:34,225
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

883
01:15:34,393 --> 01:15:36,561
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

884
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:40,273
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

885
01:15:43,777 --> 01:15:47,197
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

886
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:49,115
Officer.

887
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:54,287
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

888
01:15:54,538 --> 01:15:56,789
You gonna bust me
for nothing, man?

889
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,375
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

890
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:01,794
Then why are you
asking me for action?

891
01:16:04,381 --> 01:16:06,382
Because she sent me over.

892
01:16:08,636 --> 01:16:11,429
I suppose that ain't a.38
you've got in your sock.

893
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:13,264
A.38?

894
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,727
I'm clean, man.

895
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:20,647
- Shit, you're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

896
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:24,317
That's nice, man. All right.
That's all right.

897
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:28,279
Fifteen dollars, 15 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

898
01:16:29,907 --> 01:16:31,407
Shit.

899
01:16:31,784 --> 01:16:33,034
A cowboy, huh?

900
01:16:34,662 --> 01:16:36,996
I once had a horse.
In Coney Island.

901
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:38,915
She got hit by a car.

902
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,294
Well, take it or leave it.

903
01:16:43,504 --> 01:16:46,631
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

904
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:48,633
Because you'll be back for more.

905
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:52,679
She's 12 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

906
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:55,598
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

907
01:16:55,808 --> 01:16:58,685
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

908
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:02,272
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

909
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:07,694
But no rough stuff. All right?

910
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:14,367
All right, I'll take it.

911
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,204
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

912
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:19,622
You wanna fuck me?

913
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:22,875
You're gonna fuck her,
you give her the money.

914
01:17:24,336 --> 01:17:25,878
Catch you later, copper.

915
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:29,382
- What'd you say?
- I'll see you later, copper.

916
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:32,885
I'm no cop, man.

917
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:37,515
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

918
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:41,853
I'm hip.

919
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:45,231
Funny, you don't look hip.

920
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:51,696
Go ahead. Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

921
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:02,540
You're a funny guy.

922
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:07,754
But looks aren't everything.

923
01:18:08,172 --> 01:18:10,048
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

924
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,263
You're a funny guy.

925
01:18:57,304 --> 01:18:58,971
Hey.

926
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:01,432
The room'll cost you 10 bucks.

927
01:19:14,446 --> 01:19:16,322
I'm timing you too.

928
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:36,926
Come on.

929
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:48,104
Are you really 12 and a half?

930
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:54,235
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

931
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,657
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

932
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:05,288
How old are you?

933
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:09,041
You won't tell me?

934
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,545
- What's your name?
- Easy.

935
01:20:12,754 --> 01:20:15,673
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

936
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:18,342
Yeah, but what's your real name?

937
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,052
I don't like my real name.

938
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:22,388
But what's your real name?

939
01:20:26,226 --> 01:20:27,643
Iris.

940
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:30,146
What's wrong with that?
It's a nice name.

941
01:20:30,731 --> 01:20:32,440
That's what you think.

942
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:42,742
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

943
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:47,079
Remember when you got into
a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

944
01:20:47,372 --> 01:20:49,415
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

945
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:52,084
...and he said he wanted to
take you away.

946
01:20:52,377 --> 01:20:53,419
He pulled you away.

947
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:56,797
I don't remember that.

948
01:20:58,383 --> 01:21:01,260
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

949
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:04,138
I'm gonna get you out of here.

950
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:06,641
Listen, we better make it
or Sport'll get mad.

951
01:21:06,892 --> 01:21:09,936
- How do you wanna make it?
- I don't wanna make it. Who's Sport?

952
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:12,939
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

953
01:21:17,986 --> 01:21:19,987
Wanna make it like this?

954
01:21:25,953 --> 01:21:27,286
Listen, I...

955
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:28,955
Can't you understand something?

956
01:21:29,206 --> 01:21:32,792
You're the one that came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

957
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:34,460
Well, I must've been stoned.

958
01:21:35,128 --> 01:21:38,297
- Why? They drug you?
- Oh, come off it, man.

959
01:21:40,008 --> 01:21:41,926
What are you doing?

960
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:44,136
Don't you wanna make it?

961
01:21:47,224 --> 01:21:49,475
No, I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

962
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:52,311
Well, I could help you.

963
01:21:56,942 --> 01:21:58,192
Damn, man!

964
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,486
Goddamn it!

965
01:22:04,491 --> 01:22:07,660
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

966
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:10,329
We don't have to make it, mister.

967
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,582
Damn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

968
01:22:15,335 --> 01:22:18,004
Can't you understand why I'm here?

969
01:22:18,255 --> 01:22:20,506
I think I understand.

970
01:22:22,175 --> 01:22:24,010
I tried to get into your cab...

971
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:26,721
...and now you wanna
come and take me away.

972
01:22:28,181 --> 01:22:31,559
- Is that it?
- Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

973
01:22:31,852 --> 01:22:35,688
- I can leave any time I want to.
- Then what about that one night?

974
01:22:37,774 --> 01:22:39,859
Look, I was stoned.

975
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,488
That's why they stopped me.

976
01:22:46,283 --> 01:22:49,201
When I'm not stoned I got
no place else to go.

977
01:22:50,537 --> 01:22:52,413
So they just...

978
01:22:52,998 --> 01:22:55,124
...protect me from myself.

979
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:04,050
I don't know.

980
01:23:06,553 --> 01:23:08,888
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

981
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:12,099
Hey, look, I understand.

982
01:23:12,392 --> 01:23:17,396
- And it means something, really.
- Yeah, well.

983
01:23:18,023 --> 01:23:19,732
Well, look, can I see you again?

984
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,401
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

985
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:26,405
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

986
01:23:26,907 --> 01:23:28,574
How about breakfast tomorrow?

987
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,785
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at 1:00.

988
01:23:31,036 --> 01:23:33,412
- One o'clock?
- One o'clock.

989
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:38,084
Well, I got a thing. I don't know...

990
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:39,585
Do you want to or not?

991
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,796
Yeah, I want...
Okay, all right.

992
01:23:42,047 --> 01:23:43,547
- Okay, 1:00.
- One o'clock.

993
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:46,425
Okay. See you tomorrow.

994
01:23:47,552 --> 01:23:50,596
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

995
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:53,933
Thanks a lot, Travis.

996
01:23:55,602 --> 01:23:58,938
So long, Iris.
See you tomorrow.

997
01:24:00,273 --> 01:24:02,274
Sweet Iris.

998
01:24:26,299 --> 01:24:28,134
This is yours.

999
01:24:28,385 --> 01:24:29,969
Spend it right.

1000
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,184
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1001
01:24:37,894 --> 01:24:39,228
I will.

1002
01:24:57,831 --> 01:25:00,666
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

1003
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:02,376
They hate me.

1004
01:25:02,627 --> 01:25:05,880
Why do you think I split?
There ain't nothing there.

1005
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:09,633
Yeah, but you can't live like this.
It's a hell.

1006
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:11,677
A girl should live at home.

1007
01:25:12,512 --> 01:25:14,346
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

1008
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,348
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1009
01:25:16,516 --> 01:25:19,393
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

1010
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:21,729
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1011
01:25:21,938 --> 01:25:23,522
You should be going to school.

1012
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:27,443
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1013
01:25:27,694 --> 01:25:29,695
Hey, I'm not square. You're square.

1014
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:31,739
You're full of shit, man.

1015
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:34,200
What are you talking about?
You walk out with...

1016
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:36,744
...fucking creeps,
lowlifes and degenerates...

1017
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:40,414
...and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1018
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:42,541
For some lowlife pimp?

1019
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:44,877
Stands in a hall.

1020
01:25:46,171 --> 01:25:49,089
I'm the...? I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

1021
01:25:49,382 --> 01:25:52,718
I don't go screw and fuck with
killers and junkies the way you do.

1022
01:25:53,762 --> 01:25:55,721
You call that being hip?

1023
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:58,390
What world you from?

1024
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:06,398
- Who's a killer?
- That guy Sport's a killer.

1025
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:08,067
Sport never killed nobody.

1026
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:09,735
- He killed...
- He's a Libra.

1027
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:11,111
He's a what?

1028
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:14,698
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1029
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:19,745
He looks like a killer to me.

1030
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:23,624
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1031
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:26,085
...but my whole family
are air signs.

1032
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:27,461
He's also a dope-shooter.

1033
01:26:28,421 --> 01:26:31,632
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1034
01:26:32,092 --> 01:26:35,010
Did you ever try looking at
your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1035
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:43,435
What'll you do about
Sport and that old bastard?

1036
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:45,771
- When?
- When you leave.

1037
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:50,609
I'll just leave them.

1038
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:52,653
- Just leave?
- They got other girls.

1039
01:26:52,863 --> 01:26:55,781
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1040
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:00,119
Want me to call the cops?

1041
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:02,830
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1042
01:27:03,456 --> 01:27:07,167
Look, Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1043
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:10,796
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1044
01:27:10,964 --> 01:27:12,548
You can't allow him to do that.

1045
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:14,967
He is the lowest kind of person.

1046
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,136
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1047
01:27:17,345 --> 01:27:18,804
He's the scum of the earth.

1048
01:27:19,055 --> 01:27:20,556
He's the worst...

1049
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:24,351
...sucking scum
I have ever, ever seen.

1050
01:27:27,147 --> 01:27:29,523
You know what he told me about you?

1051
01:27:31,818 --> 01:27:35,571
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1052
01:27:37,073 --> 01:27:40,159
He does... He...
He doesn't mean it.

1053
01:27:42,162 --> 01:27:45,831
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1054
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:53,172
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know.

1055
01:27:53,381 --> 01:27:55,507
I saw...

1056
01:27:55,842 --> 01:27:58,928
...some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1057
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:01,430
Why don't you come with me?

1058
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:05,225
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1059
01:28:05,435 --> 01:28:06,852
Why not?

1060
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:12,608
- I don't go to places like that.
- Oh, come on, why not?

1061
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:14,860
I don't get along with
people like that.

1062
01:28:15,362 --> 01:28:17,237
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1063
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:20,866
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1064
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,036
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1065
01:28:24,245 --> 01:28:27,039
- Come on. Why?
- I got something very important to do.

1066
01:28:27,207 --> 01:28:28,832
So, what's so important?

1067
01:28:30,627 --> 01:28:32,920
I'm doing something
for the government.

1068
01:28:33,755 --> 01:28:36,048
The cab thing is just part-time.

1069
01:28:37,217 --> 01:28:38,717
Are you a narc?

1070
01:28:41,137 --> 01:28:42,346
Do I look like a narc?

1071
01:28:43,223 --> 01:28:44,890
Yeah.

1072
01:28:45,558 --> 01:28:47,351
I am a narc.

1073
01:28:48,436 --> 01:28:51,897
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1074
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:02,241
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- I'll give you the money to go.

1075
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:05,452
- You don't have to do that.
- I want you to take it.

1076
01:29:05,745 --> 01:29:08,455
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1077
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,499
And I wanna do it.

1078
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:13,252
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1079
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:17,423
I might be going away
for a while.

1080
01:29:43,033 --> 01:29:46,452
You're just a little tense,
that's all.

1081
01:29:46,703 --> 01:29:49,163
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1082
01:29:49,456 --> 01:29:52,416
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1083
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:56,545
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1084
01:29:58,298 --> 01:30:00,799
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1085
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:04,053
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1086
01:30:05,138 --> 01:30:07,639
You miss your man, don't you?

1087
01:30:08,975 --> 01:30:12,352
I don't like to be away
from you either.

1088
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:15,147
You know how I feel about you.

1089
01:30:16,232 --> 01:30:18,233
I depend on you.

1090
01:30:20,653 --> 01:30:21,820
I'd be lost without you.

1091
01:30:23,323 --> 01:30:25,741
Don't you ever forget that.

1092
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:37,461
How much I need you.

1093
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:41,381
Come to me, baby.

1094
01:30:51,518 --> 01:30:53,268
Let me hold you.

1095
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:04,113
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1096
01:31:08,785 --> 01:31:13,288
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1097
01:31:18,253 --> 01:31:21,213
That every woman, everywhere...

1098
01:31:22,924 --> 01:31:26,051
...had a man who loves her
like I love you.

1099
01:31:29,889 --> 01:31:33,308
God, it's good so close.

1100
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,281
You know, at times like this...

1101
01:31:47,782 --> 01:31:50,617
...I know I'm a lucky man.

1102
01:31:53,413 --> 01:31:56,665
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1103
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:06,091
It's only you that keeps me together.

1104
01:33:38,184 --> 01:33:41,019
Now I see it clearly.
My whole life has pointed...

1105
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:43,522
...in one direction. I see that now.

1106
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:48,235
There never has been
any choice for me.

1107
01:34:23,354 --> 01:34:24,396
Ladies and gentlemen...

1108
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:28,900
...the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1109
01:34:35,325 --> 01:34:36,616
Thank you, Tom.

1110
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:39,077
Ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,416
...we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1112
01:34:44,584 --> 01:34:46,752
This is no ordinary place.

1113
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:51,757
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1114
01:34:52,925 --> 01:34:55,594
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1115
01:34:55,887 --> 01:34:59,139
...because these
are not ordinary times.

1116
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:02,434
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1117
01:35:04,103 --> 01:35:07,773
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1118
01:35:08,066 --> 01:35:12,277
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1119
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,405
...into unemployment and inflation.

1120
01:35:16,282 --> 01:35:19,951
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1121
01:35:23,748 --> 01:35:27,959
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1122
01:35:36,135 --> 01:35:40,430
Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.

1123
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:43,141
They will not be easy.

1124
01:35:43,434 --> 01:35:46,937
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1125
01:35:47,146 --> 01:35:49,147
We, the people, know that.

1126
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:57,406
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1127
01:35:58,408 --> 01:36:02,702
Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and I.

1128
01:36:02,954 --> 01:36:06,206
And it is time to let the people rule!

1129
01:36:06,457 --> 01:36:07,666
Thank you.

1130
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,184
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1131
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:33,066
Palantine.

1132
01:36:40,825 --> 01:36:42,534
Thank you. Thank you.

1133
01:36:47,457 --> 01:36:48,832
Over there. Get that man.

1134
01:36:51,169 --> 01:36:52,752
Give him some air!

1135
01:36:53,463 --> 01:36:55,380
Give him some air, will you?

1136
01:36:55,673 --> 01:36:57,549
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1137
01:36:57,842 --> 01:36:59,718
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1138
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,537
What's happening?

1139
01:37:27,747 --> 01:37:29,080
Got the money?

1140
01:37:40,259 --> 01:37:41,426
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1141
01:37:41,594 --> 01:37:43,094
Okay.

1142
01:38:18,839 --> 01:38:20,799
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1143
01:38:20,967 --> 01:38:23,093
Okay, okay, my man. How...?

1144
01:38:24,595 --> 01:38:27,472
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1145
01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:29,975
How's everything
in the pimp business?

1146
01:38:31,143 --> 01:38:33,311
- Do I know you?
- No.

1147
01:38:33,563 --> 01:38:34,980
Do I know you?

1148
01:38:35,273 --> 01:38:37,107
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.

1149
01:38:37,316 --> 01:38:38,942
Do I know you?

1150
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:42,654
How's Iris?

1151
01:38:42,947 --> 01:38:44,322
You know Iris.

1152
01:38:44,574 --> 01:38:47,284
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1153
01:38:47,493 --> 01:38:49,578
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1154
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:54,791
- You don't know anybody named Iris?
- I don't know nobody named Iris.

1155
01:38:55,293 --> 01:38:56,501
No?

1156
01:38:56,836 --> 01:38:59,379
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1157
01:38:59,672 --> 01:39:02,090
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1158
01:39:03,593 --> 01:39:05,010
You got a gun?

1159
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,347
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1160
01:39:09,849 --> 01:39:11,474
Suck on this.

1161
01:39:46,552 --> 01:39:47,552
Hey!

1162
01:40:25,716 --> 01:40:27,759
You crazy son of a bitch!

1163
01:40:28,052 --> 01:40:29,427
Fucking son of a bitch!

1164
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:34,307
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1165
01:40:34,475 --> 01:40:37,477
I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!

1166
01:40:37,728 --> 01:40:39,813
Crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1167
01:40:57,456 --> 01:40:58,790
Crazy son of a bitch!

1168
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:02,419
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1169
01:41:02,628 --> 01:41:05,755
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1170
01:41:05,923 --> 01:41:09,968
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1171
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,639
Stop!

1172
01:41:27,445 --> 01:41:28,528
Don't shoot him!

1173
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,600
Dear Mr. Bickle:

1174
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:13,771
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...

1175
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:16,941
...to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1176
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:20,028
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1177
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:22,947
...when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...

1178
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,783
...but you were still in a coma.

1179
01:46:26,076 --> 01:46:28,119
There is no way we can repay you...

1180
01:46:28,328 --> 01:46:31,456
...for returning our Iris to us.

1181
01:46:31,749 --> 01:46:33,416
We thought we had lost her...

1182
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:36,794
...and now our lives are full again.

1183
01:46:37,296 --> 01:46:38,629
Needless to say...

1184
01:46:38,839 --> 01:46:43,342
...you are something
of a hero around this household.

1185
01:46:44,094 --> 01:46:47,597
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1186
01:46:47,806 --> 01:46:51,309
She's back in school and working hard.

1187
01:46:51,602 --> 01:46:54,645
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1188
01:46:54,813 --> 01:46:56,147
...as you can well imagine.

1189
01:46:57,649 --> 01:46:59,192
But we have taken steps to see...

1190
01:46:59,443 --> 01:47:03,613
...she has never cause
to run away again.

1191
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:05,615
In conclusion...

1192
01:47:05,824 --> 01:47:09,577
...Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...

1193
01:47:09,828 --> 01:47:12,497
...from the bottom of our hearts.

1194
01:47:12,706 --> 01:47:16,793
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1195
01:47:17,002 --> 01:47:20,963
...to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1196
01:47:21,173 --> 01:47:24,008
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1197
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:28,846
...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1198
01:47:29,139 --> 01:47:34,018
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

1199
01:47:35,229 --> 01:47:39,524
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up,
he says, "Hey, I wanna swap tires."

1200
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:41,317
I say, "These are new tires.

1201
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,695
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1202
01:47:44,905 --> 01:47:48,991
- His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1957.
- That's why the fleet has no spares.

1203
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:51,619
- Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
- Hey.

1204
01:47:51,829 --> 01:47:54,247
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1205
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:56,749
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1206
01:47:58,252 --> 01:47:59,544
Shit.

1207
01:48:00,379 --> 01:48:01,754
Well, see you later.

1208
01:48:02,047 --> 01:48:03,673
See you, Travis.

1209
01:48:24,778 --> 01:48:26,571
Hello, Travis.

1210
01:48:28,031 --> 01:48:29,240
Hello.

1211
01:48:50,179 --> 01:48:52,889
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1212
01:48:54,183 --> 01:48:57,268
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1213
01:48:58,312 --> 01:49:00,188
Well, I hope he wins.

1214
01:49:13,785 --> 01:49:16,913
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1215
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:22,460
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I got over that.

1216
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:27,465
The papers always
blow these things up.

1217
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:32,595
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1218
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,841
Travis.

1219
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:18,266
How much was it?

1220
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:28,776
So long.
