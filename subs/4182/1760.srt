1
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,844
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We’re dark. What the fuck?

2
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,553
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-What just happened?
-What are you looking at me for?

3
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,789
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I don't know.
-Come on! Do it! Fix it!

4
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,457
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Seriously.
-You are not doing it.

5
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,092
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Fix it. You're the computer whiz.
-Come on, do it!

6
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,968
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, what happened?

7
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,300
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hong Kong server was just hacked.

8
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,206
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Rerouting to Dubai, Iceland,

9
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,040
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Johannesburg, Rio.

10
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,171
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And Barcelona.

11
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,611
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Quadruple redundancy, plus a spare.

12
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,515
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Excellent work, my precious ones.

13
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,615
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Okay, it's on.

14
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,757
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Did you see that one?

15
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,360
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Oh, my God!

16
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,299
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Hey! What?
-That is so gross.

17
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,965
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I so just me a little.
-Right, yeah.

18
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,139
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Dude!
-Follow him.

19
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,069
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Closer.

20
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,383
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ready camera four.

21
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,880
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Go.

22
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,917
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Did you see that?
-Oh, my gosh.

23
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,278
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Right in the back! That was fantastic.
-Right in the back, are you kidding me?

24
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,321
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm not betting against Ripper anymore.

25
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,826
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Now it gets really fucked up.

26
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,522
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Are you kidding me?
Like it hasn't been already?

27
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,126
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Live or die. Live or die.

28
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,728
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}All right, kill or stay?

29
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,735
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}- Kill him. Kill him.
- Kill him.

30
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,865
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why not, right?

31
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,410
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I mean, dude, he's lost us 100 bucks.
-Let's do it.

32
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,705
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}- Kill.
- Kill, I guess.

33
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,780
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Survey says...

34
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:38,078
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Mr. Executioner, come on down!

35
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,521
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Finish him.

36
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,827
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Now!

37
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,722
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He didn't even cut it off with the first one!

38
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,659
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-He didn't even cut it off!
-God, this is so gross, you guys!

39
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,492
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-This is so gross.
-God. It makes me giddy in my underpants.

40
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,693
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come on.

41
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,859
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}This isn't real, is it?

42
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,426
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, it's like the movies.
It's special effects and stuff.

43
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,971
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Smoke and mirrors, yeah, it's...

44
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,599
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, no. No, I heard it was real.
I mean, if it was fake, it'd be on TV.

45
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,302
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-What? You're so stupid.
-Yeah, right.

46
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,674
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-There's no way.
-Seriously.

47
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,645
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My brother-in-law's friend works for the FBI.

48
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,444
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Says they're looking
for the guy that runs this thing.

49
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,990
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey.

50
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,794
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Sorry.

51
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,197
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's better.

52
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,070
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How did my gallant warrior do?

53
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,769
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Total slaughter.

54
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,338
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No mercy given?

55
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,810
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}None taken.

56
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,137
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What was the score?

57
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,511
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}A lot to a little.

58
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,050
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Defensive struggle?

59
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,246
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Always. You ready?

60
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,515
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah.

61
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,091
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Thank you.

62
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,924
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I was watching, to be honest.

63
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,939
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're gonna miss these moments.

64
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,111
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Waves of nausea
followed by crippling cramps?

65
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,882
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Somehow I doubt that.

66
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,684
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Okay, but when you're 50,

67
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,749
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}don't get all teary-eyed
reminiscing about those pregnant days

68
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,953
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and how you miss them.

69
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,160
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're such a man.

70
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,987
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You think you know everything,

71
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,330
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}but you know nothing of
the inner workings of the female body.

72
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,733
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But you still have to give your opinion.

73
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,538
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And expect everyone to accept it as fact.

74
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,408
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I know to bail on this conversation.

75
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,704
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah. Good thinking.

76
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,171
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}David!

77
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,646
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-You all right?
-Yeah.

78
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,730
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Lori.

79
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,970
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Baby?

80
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,068
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}David, I'm sorry.

81
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,486
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I don't speak Mexican, senorita.

82
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,219
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No sleeping in the bar. You understand that?

83
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,508
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Just give me another bottle of...

84
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,445
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Whatever it is I'm drinking, okay?

85
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,048
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Okay.

86
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,351
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's for you.

87
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,455
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Where’s the head at?

88
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,121
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's over there.

89
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,961
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah.

90
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,603
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}One more, please.

91
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,606
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hello.

92
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,374
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey.

93
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,027
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Where's my drink?

94
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,456
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I don't smoke.

95
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,891
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But you do speak French.

96
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,329
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What happened to your face?

97
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,863
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Life sucks. Scars happen.

98
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,930
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know,
this is the third bar I've seen you in.

99
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:49,276
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You like to flash those big bills
or perhaps you have a Mexican death wish.

100
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,315
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You traveling alone?

101
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,307
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What business is it to you?

102
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,678
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}None, really.

103
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,824
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But from what I saw in there,
I thought we could make ourselves

104
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,656
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}not so lonely.

105
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,986
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I hope you have e nicer place
than this shithole to fuck your wife.

106
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,157
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Not that I'm complaining.

107
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,204
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm not married.

108
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,605
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What? She leave you?

109
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,569
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}She's dead.

110
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,447
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Then I guess she won't be missing you.

111
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,604
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I've got something for you here.

112
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,149
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Check him for tracking devices.
If you find anything, dump his corpse.

113
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,523
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Make sure you're not followed.

114
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,208
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hello?

115
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,744
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hello?

116
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,308
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Don't draw attention.

117
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,215
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who's there?

118
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,884
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Over here.

119
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,186
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Where am I?

120
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,522
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hell.

121
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,947
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What is the one thing
we all have in common?

122
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,495
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Dead

123
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,975
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The only questions are how and when
the Grim Reaper will visit.

124
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,007
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}A problem you need not
worry about any longer

125
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,843
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}This point forward,

126
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,121
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}your life isn't yours anymore.

127
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,322
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It belongs to me.

128
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,326
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You are no longer David Lord.

129
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,392
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He ceases to exist.

130
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,298
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your name is Death Dealer.

131
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,533
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You were bred to fight.

132
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,327
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}To kill.

133
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,194
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And to die.

134
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,465
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who are you?

135
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,911
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and your demise will be on of glory.

136
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,378
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Resist,

137
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:22,317
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and I promise you pain in the likes of which
you never could conceive imaginable.

138
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,546
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What do you want?

139
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,554
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Help! Hello?

140
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,189
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Somebody help me!

141
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,456
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Let me out!

142
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,479
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your name is Death Dealer.

143
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,106
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What are you doing?

144
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,411
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You were bred to fight.

145
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,912
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}To kill. To die.

146
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,913
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your name is Death Dealer
You were bred to fight.

147
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,015
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill. Death Dealer. To die. To kill.

148
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,891
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your name is Death Dealer.
You were bred to fight.

149
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,396
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill, kill, kill. Your name is... Die.

150
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,063
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So, what do we know about him?

151
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,034
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's a fireman from Denver.

152
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,737
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I thought he was a doctor.

153
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,999
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He has a paramedic license.
He's not a doctor.

154
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,599
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Family?

155
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,607
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Wife, deceased.

156
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,770
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's a fucking doctor.

157
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,406
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}At least the last guy she grabbed was
a competitive Kendo artist.

158
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,883
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, this guy is a fireman, okay?

159
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,047
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Have you seen him? He's, like, 85 kilograms.

160
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,181
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-186...
-Milla.

161
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,853
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-He'll flight.
-He's fucking useless. He's a piece of shit.

162
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,897
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's so typical of you, Milla.

163
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,262
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My dear Kaden.

164
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,701
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's been in your care for three days
and he's yet to give you the time of day.

165
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,070
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Maybe Kaden's tired old shtick
won't break him.

166
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,842
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'll guarantee you
he'll respond to a little honey instead.

167
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,539
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Dirty, fucking whore.

168
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,381
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's my fighter. I recruited him.

169
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,476
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's my risk, my responsibility.

170
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,990
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}May I remind both of you
they are all my fighters.

171
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,457
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And this is my world.

172
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,925
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But you're absolutely right, Milla.

173
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,719
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's your risk.

174
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,493
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's also your ass.

175
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,660
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, he'll fight and he'll win.

176
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,400
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Do whatever it takes.

177
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,135
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Just make sure he fights.

178
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,170
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's your name?

179
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,833
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You went my reel name
or the one they gave me?

180
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,603
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The real one.

181
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,372
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Mori. Taiga Mori.

182
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,951
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm from Osaka.

183
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,717
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You don't sound Japanese.

184
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,186
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I studied architecture at Harvard.

185
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,258
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I'm...
-David Lord.

186
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,895
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Firefighter/paramedic from Denver.

187
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,728
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You hurt?

188
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,999
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We’re going to die here, David Lord.

189
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,437
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Nah, nah, don't talk like that.

190
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,005
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My wife, Akiko,

191
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,909
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}she used to say that I was the strong one.

192
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:27,023
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The survivor. But I'm not. I'm weak.

193
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,447
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm tired.

194
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,158
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And I'm angry.

195
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,526
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And all I went to do
is kill those motherfuckers!

196
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,863
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Showtime.

197
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,382
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hold your breath! Hold!

198
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,718
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Tough it up!
-Tough it up!

199
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,623
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You look like shit.

200
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,223
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The magic cocktail
is already whispering in your ear.

201
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,129
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why are you doing this?

202
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,160
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's your name?

203
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,670
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}David Lord.

204
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,810
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What were you going to name your child?

205
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,681
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Leave my family out of this.

206
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,881
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your wife, she's pretty.

207
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,451
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Such a pity she's gone.

208
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,966
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}In the Marines, how many men, women
and children did you kill?

209
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,070
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No matter.

210
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,197
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}'Cause you aren't prepared
for what’s about to happen.

211
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,076
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Whether you live or die.

212
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,036
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How will you live or die?

213
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,346
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's your choice.

214
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,080
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What?

215
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,149
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-You want me?
-I'd love to get my hands on you.

216
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,852
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's the spirit.

217
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,795
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, no, no!

218
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,870
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}New guy doesn't stand a chance.

219
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,400
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yoshi.

220
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,167
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We need to talk about your TPS reports.

221
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,310
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah. The cover sheets.

222
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,740
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I know. I know.

223
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,529
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Home again, home again.

224
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,868
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And how are my two beauties this fine day?

225
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,237
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Ready to go.
-Ready to go.

226
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,706
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Magnificent.

227
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,436
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Let's make something special, shall we?

228
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,073
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What is your name?

229
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,147
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}David Lord.

230
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,753
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No. Your name is Death Dealer.

231
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,963
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Now I'm gonna ask you again.

232
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,537
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What is your name?

233
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,377
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Input a six-second delay.

234
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,137
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Link the video screen.

235
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,882
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ladies, if you will.

236
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,083
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Lights.

237
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,121
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Lay in graphics.

238
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,291
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Marvelous!

239
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,762
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Outstanding. You've outdone yourselves,
my little pearls.

240
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:08,969
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We are going live in three, two, one.
Cue music.

241
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,469
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not gonna fight!

242
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,670
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Boring.

243
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,743
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What a coward.

244
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,072
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}If I was a betting man, Milla, and I am,

245
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,640
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'd say you're going to lose this one.

246
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,134
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-No.
-Get up, get up, get up!

247
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,499
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ladies, please, do something.

248
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,566
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My lids are getting heavy.
I'm falling asleep here.

249
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,668
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yeah!
-Dude.

250
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,247
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's shit.

251
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,306
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What?

252
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,293
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, I'll be damned.

253
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,499
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Oh, my God!

254
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,402
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It is now time for the Fan-atics to vote.

255
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,281
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Survey says...

256
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,282
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Mr. Executioner, come on down!

257
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,286
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm a paramedic.
I'm gonna stop the bleeding.

258
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,019
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's he doing?

259
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,025
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I've got a child.

260
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,230
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm David Lord and I've been kidnapped!

261
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,230
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Cut the audio. Cue music.

262
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,771
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Can you smell it? It's just like sweetness.

263
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,408
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Naughty boy.

264
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,308
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Get him out of there, please.

265
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:52,228
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And we are out in three, two, one.

266
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,867
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant show.

267
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,699
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You were marvelous.
And you were marvelous.

268
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,612
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey!

269
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,651
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Stop right there!

270
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,286
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

271
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,054
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's an embarrassment.
I should have cut him in half there and then.

272
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,617
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, no, no!

273
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,425
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You are not going to kill him!

274
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,692
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yes, I am.

275
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,132
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kaden, be reasonable.

276
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,305
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Reasonable? This cunt deserves to die.

277
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,501
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yes he does, but not this way.

278
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,572
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's wasted if he dies off camera.

279
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,668
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fuck the cameras!

280
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,742
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kaden, where's your sense of adventure?

281
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,409
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He wronged me.

282
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,918
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He wronged us!

283
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,922
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Look, I want to hold his head
on tho chopping block for you.

284
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,889
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But we can break him.
We can make him fight.

285
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,853
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We can make him fight for us.

286
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,525
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}On our stage.

287
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,190
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And if he won't?

288
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,032
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Then you get your wish. Fuck the cameras.

289
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,029
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So, there we were.

290
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:41,002
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Akiko got a headache from the flight,
so she went out to get some Aspirin.

291
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,970
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That was the last time I ever saw her.

292
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,873
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Searched the city for days.

293
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,244
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Contacted the authorities,
the embassy. Nothing.

294
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,052
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}There was no trace of her.

295
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,219
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And than I got a phone call.

296
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,158
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It was the first time I ever heard that voice.

297
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,561
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And she said

298
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,538
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}if I ever wanted to see my wife alive,

299
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,269
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I should do exactly what she says.

300
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,571
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's so fucking cliche!

301
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,377
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I should have known something was up
when she never asked for a ransom.

302
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,521
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}She told me to go to this bar outside the city.

303
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,692
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}To go alone.

304
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,662
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But when I got there,

305
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,660
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}there was no Akiko.

306
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,964
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Only that woman.

307
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,968
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}She's the same woman that brought you.

308
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,404
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Then I woke up here.

309
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,138
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How long has it been?

310
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,271
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}A month. Six weeks maybe.

311
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,978
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}When you never see the sun rise or set,
how do you knew?

312
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,290
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why'd they choose you?

313
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,393
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Because I trained with weapons all my life.

314
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,920
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Have you fought?

315
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,524
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah.

316
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,093
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It was either him or me.

317
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,236
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We're all already dead anyway.

318
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,041
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I brought you something to eat.

319
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,379
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why?

320
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,752
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's simple.

321
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,430
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Satisfied?

322
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,441
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You were lucky. You won't be next time.

323
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,943
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why do you care?

324
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,290
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I can help you.
-I don't need your help.

325
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,326
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Without me, you'd be dead very soon.

326
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,358
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's in it for you, huh?

327
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,088
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I recruited you.

328
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,200
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You win, I win.

329
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,336
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I know it must be maddening for you,
but your situation is hopeless.

330
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,043
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Can't escape.

331
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,841
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You can only hope to survive.

332
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,476
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who the hell are you?

333
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,850
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I am that man behind the curtain.

334
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,986
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're sick.

335
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,325
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}When I was growing up,
my father used to stage these brutal,

336
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,624
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}bare-knuckle fights in the backyard.

337
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,632
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}All these assholes would come over
and drink and gamble

338
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,965
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and cheer the winners and spit on the losers.

339
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,432
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, in my mind,

340
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,498
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}just watching those poor fools lose
wasn't enough.

341
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,604
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So I've upped the ante, as it were.

342
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,309
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm gonna kill you. You know that?

343
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:29,547
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What we have here is
a failure to communicate.

344
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,062
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I have always wanted to say that!

345
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,697
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I love Strother Martin.

346
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,605
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Where were we?

347
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,573
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yes.

348
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,407
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The paradox.

349
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,850
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You won't fight,

350
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,612
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}but you don't want to die.

351
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,684
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But you will die,

352
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,751
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}if you won't fight.

353
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,850
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You see our dilemma?

354
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,228
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I won't fight. Not for you.

355
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,195
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, who would you fight for? Your wife?

356
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,835
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's right. She's dead.

357
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,231
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, what would you fight for?

358
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,642
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your freedom?

359
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,948
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, seriously.
I'll make you a proposition.

360
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,511
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You give me, say, 10 fights.

361
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,156
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-One down, nine to go.
-I didn't kill that man.

362
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,750
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Horribly mutilated and left for dead?

363
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,093
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Knowing he was going to be killed, huh?
Shades of gray, David.

364
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,824
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Shades of gray.

365
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,666
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You give me an all-out effort,

366
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,261
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}nine more times and win,

367
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,199
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and I'll let you go.

368
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,307
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm witness to kidnapping, torture
and murder.

369
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,870
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I know your faces.

370
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,711
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You really want me to believe
you'll just let me go?

371
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,846
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, you'll be drugged and dropped on
some desolate road in a Third World country,

372
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,323
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}yeah, but you'll be free.

373
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,091
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And as far as you knowing who we are,

374
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,290
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}you don't know shit.

375
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:23,203
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Look, the FBI, MI5, Interpol,
all kinds of motherfuckers are looking for us.

376
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,965
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I don't fear a fireman from Denver.

377
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,278
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I give you my word.

378
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,140
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Give me nine more fights and win,

379
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,050
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and, in the words of Abraham Lincoln,

380
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,146
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}"I'll set you free!"

381
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,650
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fuck you! I'll die before I kill for you.

382
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:51,730
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I am sorely disappointed. Crushed, really.

383
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,167
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But I haven't lost my appetite.

384
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,527
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What is your name?

385
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,558
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You expecting a different answer?

386
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,939
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Death Dealer.

387
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,270
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How lovely it would be.

388
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,013
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But first,

389
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,682
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}you must fight for me.

390
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,420
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Or what?

391
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,752
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You gonna kill me?

392
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:52,921
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No. I'm gonna kill her.

393
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,755
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your friend's wife. Akiko.

394
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,693
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You have three minutes

395
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,904
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}to kill your opponent.

396
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,307
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And by kill, I mean...

397
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,912
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Off with his head.

398
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,506
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You do that in the allotted amount of time,

399
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,821
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}she goes free.

400
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,451
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But you lose,

401
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:29,086
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}or you're one second over three minutes,

402
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,833
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I will slice her throat,

403
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,496
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}and bleed her like a little fucking piggy.

404
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,168
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know, they say

405
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,572
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}you drown in your own blood.

406
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,919
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Sounds like a horrible way to go.

407
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,190
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'll take it that you accept my offer.

408
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,989
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey, dude, come here.

409
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,521
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're retarded. Come on. Line up's up.

410
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,791
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-"White Samurai"?
-Yeah.

411
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,696
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's only fought once. He's kind of a pussy.

412
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,961
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're kind of a pussy.

413
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,866
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-I like the Dealer of Death.
-Death Dealer.

414
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,427
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Whatever.
-No, not whatever.

415
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,370
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}His name is Death Dealer,
that's what you should call him.

416
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,839
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Shut up, okay?

417
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,770
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Oh, my gosh, a damsel in distress.

418
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,876
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Classic.
-I love samurais.

419
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:55,974
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who doesn't?

420
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,543
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Bring up the music.

421
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,016
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Gently. Gently.

422
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,056
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Now give me a breeze.

423
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,743
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Lovely!

424
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,383
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ninjas don't like samurais.

425
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,981
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's not true.
Ninjas and samurais are like cousins.

426
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,062
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yeah.
-Yeah!

427
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,293
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-That is disgusting.
-I love it when they get gruesome.

428
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,282
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Do you think he's gonna make it?
-Yeah.

429
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,620
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-No, he's done. He's done.
-No, he's hurt.

430
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,872
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-What?
-Awesome!

431
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,483
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-David.
-Taiga. Taiga.

432
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,018
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Taiga, no, no, no.

433
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,019
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}They told me they would kill her.

434
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,487
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm sorry.

435
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,693
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Safe.
-That was Insane.

436
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,834
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm sorry.

437
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:31,362
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The White Samurai fought with with bravery.

438
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,136
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But was unable to defeat his opponent

439
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,279
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And unable to save his princess.

440
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,503
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That was a little gross.

441
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,041
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm sorry.

442
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,084
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}There's nothing I can do.

443
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,761
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why are you letting this man suffer?

444
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,888
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}End it. Kill him.

445
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,627
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill him now.

446
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,775
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Awesome!

447
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,988
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fade music.

448
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,735
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fade graphics.

449
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:13,741
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And we're out.

450
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,240
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That was astounding!

451
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,717
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kudos to us all.

452
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,922
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You said he would fight, Milla,
and fight he did.

453
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,648
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My money, please.

454
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:39,460
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ladies, will you please wire Milla's winnings.

455
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,930
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kawaii.

456
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,114
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}A little something extra.

457
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,784
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You've done exceedingly well, Milla.

458
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,047
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your fireman from Denver
may turn out to be a rainmaker.

459
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,024
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey

460
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,559
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You.

461
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,631
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The one behind the curtain.

462
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,435
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yes.

463
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,297
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I accept your offer.

464
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,839
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I will give my absolute best
for another eight fights.

465
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,472
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}On one condition.

466
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,174
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And that is?

467
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,682
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The last fight,

468
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,916
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I want him.

469
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,226
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Those are my terms.

470
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,024
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You don't like them,

471
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,229
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}then we're done with this bullshit right now.

472
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,766
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You are not going to kill yourself.
You're bluffing.

473
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,577
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You don't think I could beat him.

474
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,773
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Please, it's a nonissue.

475
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,150
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No one's ever survived five contests,
let alone 10.

476
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,288
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}People want to see me fight.

477
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,451
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I want to fight.

478
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,120
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well?

479
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,525
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's it gonna be?

480
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,995
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's up to you, Kaden.

481
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,770
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And what if he wins?

482
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:30,336
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know I'd never allow that to happen.

483
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,107
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We accept your offer,

484
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,347
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Death Dealer.

485
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,071
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}They're moving you into another room.

486
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,774
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'd rather have antibiotics.

487
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,283
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I can get you those.

488
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,945
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What changed?

489
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,189
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You fought.

490
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,851
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You mean, I won.

491
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,324
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So what? Now I'm your prize pig?

492
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,197
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How much is your cut

493
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,966
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}of the death of another innocent life, huh?

494
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,371
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Do you want the antibiotics or not?

495
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,506
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah, I want the antibiotics.

496
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,449
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And something to sew it up!

497
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,377
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Watch the muscle, watch the muscle.

498
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,620
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Right there.

499
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,434
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Wider stitches, okay?

500
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,267
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Very good. Pull the skin.

501
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,467
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Pull the skin. Pull it tight.

502
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,529
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fuck.

503
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,845
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah, yeah.

504
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,808
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Looks like you're getting better.

505
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,738
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Better enough to fight.

506
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,183
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Exactly.

507
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,154
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Thank you.

508
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,563
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Really.

509
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,959
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah, we sure do like a whipping.
But nothing

510
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,934
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}like a pussy-whipping.

511
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,279
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hey, check this out.

512
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,978
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What's up?

513
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,215
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Dude.
-Yeah.

514
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,780
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hell, yeah, Death Dealer will be all over him.

515
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,587
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-You think so?
-Definitely.

516
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,924
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-He's gonna kill him.
-The Executioner's a big guy.

517
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,820
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What'd you do to your hair?

518
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,258
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Just trying something a little different.

519
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,885
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I am David Lord.

520
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,218
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah!Yeah!

521
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,657
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Oh, my goodness!

522
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:36,227
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He is every bit as good
as you were in your prime.

523
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,665
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know, just say the word, partner.

524
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,438
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We can call this off.

525
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:41,095
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My name is David Lord.
And in one more fight, I'm gonna kill you.

526
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,611
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That was amazing, my man.

527
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,718
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Bravo! Bravo!

528
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,055
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Better watch your back.

529
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,258
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He may have found himself a new favorite.

530
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,639
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We've got a situation up here.

531
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,920
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Brutus Jackson,
who terrorized South Africa 12 months ago

532
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,482
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}by going on e drug-induced rampage,
killing 14 people, has escaped.

533
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,759
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Jackson was being transferred
to the death row facility at Pollsmoor

534
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,926
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}when the transport carrying him
was brazenly ambhushed

535
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,299
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}just outside the Robben Island Prison gate.

536
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,897
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The three guards escorting Jackson
were found dead at the scene.

537
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,409
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Local authorities have
no further information at this time.

538
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,975
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Are you out of your fucking mind?

539
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,344
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I don't see the problem.

540
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,846
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The whole universe is looking for us
and you pull a stunt like this!

541
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,654
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You kidnap a world-famous serial killer?

542
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:19,918
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Spree killer.

543
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,157
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You might as well
drop a trail of bread crumbs

544
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,926
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}leading law enforcement to our door!

545
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,491
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come on. The deadbeats are boring.

546
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,538
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}All the mind fucking in the world
can't help someone who's physically weak.

547
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,466
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Listen, and this guy,

548
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:38,634
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}he is a monster.

549
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:40,473
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He is ready to kill again.

550
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:45,085
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Think of the added revenue
when our audience sees that it's him.

551
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:49,684
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No longer will anyone be able to claim
that our fights aren’t reel.

552
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,025
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're afraid of him.

553
01:05:56,385 --> 01:06:00,299
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah, and you will be, too,
once you get up close and personal.

554
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,030
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, no, no. Not the serial killer.

555
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,266
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're afraid of the fireman.

556
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:13,312
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You are hurting me!

557
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,160
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}What?

558
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,134
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How did you come to be their hostage?

559
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,229
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's funny.

560
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,510
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Let's just say
my family wasn't as pleasant as they are.

561
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,307
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Certainly with less reward.

562
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,146
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kaden's afraid of you.

563
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,458
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He brought in some professional,

564
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,787
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}some maniac from South Africa.

565
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,237
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come back alive. Please.

566
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,678
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Just two more
and at least one of us will be free.

567
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,385
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know they won't let me live.

568
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,321
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I have a brother, Sam.

569
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,364
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We haven't spoken since the accident.

570
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,464
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I tuned out everyone I ever loved.

571
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,369
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He probably doesn't even know I'm missing.

572
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,965
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Or that I'll soon be dead.

573
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,567
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Wish I had been a better brother.

574
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,708
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Now I want closure, you know?

575
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,288
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So have you guys done that whole,
you know,

576
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,026
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-college threesome thing yet or...
-Dude.

577
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,395
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're never gonna believe
who Death Dealer is fighting.

578
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,537
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Remember that South African
serial killer guy?

579
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:51,594
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yeah.
-The one who escaped?

580
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,367
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yeah.
-Yeah. Him.

581
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,132
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Tonight?
-Now.

582
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,370
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It was nice meeting you guys. Have fun.

583
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,177
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Death Dealer! Death Dealer!

584
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,787
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Oh, my God.
-Sacagawea!

585
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,254
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Kill the man!
-Yeah!

586
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,235
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}God damn!

587
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,600
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Where'd he go?

588
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,874
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kaneko, Kawaii, can one of you find him?

589
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:41,183
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Having a little bit of fun now,
aren't we? Yeah?

590
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,919
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

591
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:57,932
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yes! All day long, yeah!
-God, this is so awesome!

592
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,036
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Yeah!Yeah!

593
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,674
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Got a lot of fight in ya.

594
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,715
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's pointless, although it's noble.

595
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,902
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's nice. Very nice.

596
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,833
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Very, very nice.

597
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,939
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Payback's a bitch, huh?

598
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,978
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's been nice knowing you.

599
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,102
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Yeah!
-Oh, my God!

600
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,975
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That was frickin' awesome.

601
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,788
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Fade music.

602
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,033
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Titles.

603
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,063
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And we are out.

604
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:22,405
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}

605
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,825
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hello.

606
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,363
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Talk or I hang up.

607
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,666
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}HI, I'm looking for Sam Lord.

608
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,399
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who’s calling?

609
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,646
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I have a message for you
from your brother, David.

610
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:06,542
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}From my brother, David? David Lord?

611
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,550
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who is this?

612
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,987
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm just a friend.

613
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,823
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Is this a joke?

614
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,454
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No, no, he wanted me to tell you something.

615
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,827
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My brother's dead.

616
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,197
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Not yet, but soon.

617
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,434
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}He's dead to me.

618
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,217
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Can you help me?

619
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,459
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-He just owned that, you knew?
-Game's on in 10 minutes.

620
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:22,889
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You can't just, like...

621
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,454
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}If you hold it too long,
it's like sitting on the pot and not shitting.

622
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,481
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, well, well, the Wizard himself.

623
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,814
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}To what do I owe
the extreme pleasure of this surprise visit?

624
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,793
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Well, fireman, you got your wish.

625
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,191
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Any thoughts to what you're gonna do
when you're free?

626
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,196
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So how's it gonna come?

627
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,667
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}How's what gonna come?

628
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,005
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}All right, okay, so you know.

629
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,770
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Here I had this speech prepared
I was gonna give, but...

630
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,117
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I had the lab whip this up.

631
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,523
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Genius little concoction.

632
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,283
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Takes about 20 minutes to kick in.

633
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,926
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It won't kill you.

634
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:32,164
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Just throw you off your game. Teeny bit.

635
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,962
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Can't have our fans feeling like
they got ripped off, now can we?

636
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,200
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}They’ve come to expect
great things from you.

637
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,969
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You and Kaden, you're both just cowards.

638
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,142
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No. No, only me.

639
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,939
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kaden may be a lot of things,
but he's not a coward.

640
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:55,011
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You are really great in there.

641
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,717
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's like you were born to do this.

642
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,287
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know, there is another way.

643
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:06,059
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You could stay and achieve true greatness.

644
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,694
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Let's just get this over with.

645
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,803
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}May I?

646
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,385
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I told you I'd kill you.

647
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,426
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}After I'm done with Kaden.

648
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,263
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Good luck with that.

649
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,452
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your boyfriend dies tonight.

650
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,839
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-So gonna whup his ass.
-Here we go, here we go.

651
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:23,803
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Run for it!

652
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:14,951
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come on, Kaden.

653
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,503
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come on.

654
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,063
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}These guys are horrible. God, stop.

655
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,772
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Lori. Lori. Lori!

656
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:54,225
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I don't know how it happened,
but your cover was blown.

657
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,256
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Probably a retaliation
for the Korean sanction.

658
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,105
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Hi, I'm looking for Sam Lord.

659
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,733
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Who's calling?

660
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:14,303
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I have a message for you
from your brother, David.

661
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,514
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}From my brother David? David Lord?

662
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,285
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Ready the men.
We have a location on Agent Searle.

663
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,350
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come on.

664
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:30,889
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Come here, you.

665
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,703
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You ready to die, Death Dealer, huh?
Ready to die?

666
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,711
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}They've got a website. Death Games.

667
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:47,738
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Real fucked up shit.

668
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,548
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}But they're no two-bit operation.
Their online security is flawless.

669
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:54,314
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So their origins are unknown
and so far untraceable.

670
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,322
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So is the money trail.

671
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,013
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Dead end every time.

672
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:07,055
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that this is the
closest thing there is to e suicide mission.

673
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,693
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Are you sure?
-I want this assignment.

674
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,562
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Give it!

675
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:31,715
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill him.

676
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:49,698
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}That's quality action right there.

677
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:00,280
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Who are you?
-My name is David Lord.

678
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,515
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}David Lord. David Lord.

679
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,215
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Your cover name will be David Lord.

680
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,219
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You're a firefighter and a paramedic
from Denver, Colorado.

681
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:09,057
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}My name is Death Dealer.

682
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:12,127
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-No.
-I was bred to fight. To kill.

683
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:13,726
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I made you.

684
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,463
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And I will end you!

685
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:17,295
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No.

686
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:33,482
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why and how in the fuck is he still standing?

687
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,448
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Can you help me?

688
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,575
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Why are you smiling, you conniving bitch?

689
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,236
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Do you realize what you...
-Logan!

690
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,360
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You know what to do.

691
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,694
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

692
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,420
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

693
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,205
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Going somewhere?

694
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:27,555
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I could have killed you months ago!
I protected you!

695
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,930
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Somehow I don't feel protected.

696
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:37,695
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Look, I can give you more money
than you could ever spend!

697
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:38,999
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'm sure you could.

698
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,062
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Here, take it!

699
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:49,512
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}On the ground, on the ground,
get on the ground!

700
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:56,788
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Room's clear.

701
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,523
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I never murdered anyone!
It was Kaden, he's the one!

702
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,427
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}And your hands are clean?

703
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,158
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Cleaner than yours!

704
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:09,965
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You can't make somebody change, David!

705
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,937
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}You murdered those people
be use you wanted to do it!

706
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:18,200
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}All that bullshit about brainwashing
You didn't have to do it! You wanted to do it!

707
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:21,907
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's who you are,
it's who you've always been!

708
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,348
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We’re the same, you're just like me!

709
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:25,543
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}So tell me,

710
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:28,984
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}since we're the same, what am I about to do?

711
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,568
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}No!No!No!

712
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,184
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Drop your weapon and get on your knees!
Drop your weapon!

713
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,491
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Drop your weapon!

714
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,258
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Agent Searle?

715
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,398
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Agent Searle?

716
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,598
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Agent Searle, it's good to see you made it.

717
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,838
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I'd almost given up hope.

718
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,943
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}I killed all those men.

719
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,707
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}It's okay, son.

720
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,581
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}They were already dead.

721
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:12,852
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}The important thing to remember is
that you saved countless others.

722
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,124
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}One of them is still alive.

723
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:20,630
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}-Find him.
-We will.

724
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,225
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}We'll find him. I promise you that.

725
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:44,047
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}She's the only reason I'm alive.

726
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:47,520
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Don't worry about her, David.
She's in good hands.

727
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,560
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}Her kind,

728
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:54,361
{\fs22\1c&H4080FF&}they almost always and up on their feet.
Come on.
