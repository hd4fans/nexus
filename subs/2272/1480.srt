00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,660
AMC台《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously on the AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,480
栅栏继续往里凹陷的话
Fence keeps bending in like that,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,000
行尸会闯进来的
those walkers are coming over it.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,960
兽医院的药  人也能用
That veterinary college, the drugs are the same we need.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,780
输液袋  输液管  夹子  连接头都有了
Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,320
-单子上的都有了  -好的  走吧
- Everything on the list. - All right, let's roll.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,320
我不能让你这么做
I can't let you do this.

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,380
那里面的人饱受煎熬
There are people in there suffering.

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,510
-凯伦和大卫是你杀的吗  -是的
- Did you kill Karen and David? - Yes.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,880
我不会让你留下
I won't have you there.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,010
你能在外面生存
You're gonna survive out here.

12
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,130
亨利  你得冷静下来
Henry, I need you to calm down.

13
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,560
我们在试图帮忙
We're trying to help.

14
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,840
不
No--!

15
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,910
你俩都喝点
Drink some of that. Both of you.

16
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,000
这场委员会会议真不赖
Some council meeting, huh?

17
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,600
少了两个人
We're two members short.

18
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,410
我想我们应该在他们归来之前制定新规矩
I think we should make some new rules before they get back.

19
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,790
我特此宣布  每周三的周二
I hereby declare we have spaghetti Tuesdays

20
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,410
我们都吃意式细面[玩笑]
every Wednesday.

21
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,160
首先我们得找到意式细面
First we have to find some spaghetti.

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,740
交给你没问题吗
You okay to take over?

23
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,600
每五到六秒就挤压一次
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
你开始觉得头晕时
You start feeling lightheaded,

25
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,620
就叫别人来接替你
grab somebody else to take over.

26
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,070
我们轮流来做
We'll take it in shifts.

27
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,220
你想帮我去巡查吗
You want to help me go on my rounds?

28
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,720
好
Yeah.

29
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,870
没问题
Sure.

30
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,050
那样能保住他多久的命
How long will that keep him alive?

31
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,910
只要我们愿意坚持  他就能活下去
Just as long as we're willing to do it.

32
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,770
不管需要多久
As long as it takes.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,670
不  在这不行
No. Not here.

34
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,590
帮我把他抬上来
Help me get him on this.

35
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,350
好吧  但过了几小时  亨利死了时...
Okay, but in a couple of hours when Henry's dead--

36
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,090
-格伦  -我们怎么能把他的尸体
- Glenn. - How are we gonna get his body

37
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,440
抬下楼  经过牢房区
down the stairs, across the cell block

38
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,270
经过一扇扇门  同时不让别人发现呢
and through those doors without anyone noticing?

39
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,990
如果发生了那种情况  你得帮我
If that happens-- if-- you're gonna help me.

40
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,890
如果我不在了呢
And what if I'm gone?

41
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,080
闭嘴  帮我把他抬上来
Shut up and help me get him on this.

42
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,310
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

43
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
我们把雅各布森先生送去更安静的地方
We're taking Mr. Jacobson to a quieter place.

44
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,870
去我的房里拿那本《汤姆・索耶历险记》吧
Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer" from my room.

45
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,900
我想让你今晚看完
I want you to read it by tonight.

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,760
我们都有活要干
We all got jobs to do.

47
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,830
-那是你的任务  -我看不完的
- That one's yours. - I won't finish it.

48
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,250
为什么
Why?

49
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,050
会太黑的  看不见
It's gonna get too dark.

50
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,720
好吧
Well,

51
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,740
尽量试试
give it your best try.

52
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,910
还有喝点茶
And drink some tea.

53
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,870
你以前还没这样做过吧
You haven't had to do this yet, have you?

54
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,950
昨晚深夜时有一个人去世了
There was one late last night.

55
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,420
是萨沙动手的
Sasha did it.

56
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,460
人们没必要看见
People don't need to see it.

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,980
我不想让他们看见
I don't want them to.

行尸走肉
第四季  第五集

78
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,120
格伦呢  他说会来见我
Where's Glenn? He said he would meet me.

79
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,370
他在休息
He's resting.

80
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,610
他没事吧
Is he okay?

81
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,070
他一直在帮我忙  很累了  就这样
He was helping me and he got tired, that's all.

82
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,350
-如果你需要帮忙  我可以来  -我不需要
- If you need help, I can help you. - I don't.

83
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,530
我只是让他有事情做
I was just keeping him occupied.

84
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,770
让他只想着帮助别人
Keeping his mind on helping people.

85
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,400
我可以进去帮你
I can come in there and help you.

86
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,930
不  你不用进来
No, you don't need to.

87
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,300
-这样你可以休息  -不
- You can rest-- - No!

88
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,190
贝丝怎么样
How's Bethy?

89
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,130
她很好
She's okay.

90
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,330
老爸  感觉你要累垮了
Daddy, you look so tired.

91
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,200
的确
I am.

92
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,700
但我扛得住
But I'm fine.

93
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,580
他们很快就会回来了
They could return any minute now.

94
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,520
里面情况很糟
It's hard in here.

95
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,670
但我们能坚持住
But we're holding it together.

96
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,530
能挺过去的
We're gonna make it.

97
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,140
你相信的对吧
Don't you believe that?

98
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,110
当然
Of course.

99
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,380
只要再多坚持一下
Just hold it together a little longer.

100
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,680
拜托了
Please?

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,730
宝贝儿  我爱你
I love you, honey.

102
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,120
我也爱你
I love you, too.

103
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,200
多谢你拦住了她
Thank you for stopping her.

104
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,270
外面总得有人照料
We need someone out there taking care of things.

105
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,400
如果她看见我
If she saw me,

106
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,960
肯定会进来陪我
couldn't keep her out.

107
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,280
我知道你不想骗她
I know you didn't want to lie to her.

108
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,770
我并没有骗啊
I wasn't lying.

109
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
你看你  这不是在休息吗
Look at you. You're resting.

110
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,080
事情差不多做完了
I'm almost done down here.

111
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,540
要不你去躺着休息吧
Why don't you go lie down?

112
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,640
卡尔  朱迪思  他们还好吧
Carl, Judith, are they okay?

113
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,570
还好  卡萝尔人呢
Yeah. Where's Carol?

114
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,110
格伦  赫谢尔  萨沙呢
Glenn, Hershel, Sasha?

115
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,690
情况很糟  但还撑着  达里尔还没回来
Yeah, it's bad, but they're fighting it. Daryl's not back yet.

116
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,050
瑞克  卡萝尔呢
Rick. Rick, where's Carol?

117
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,010
是她
It was her.

118
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,160
杀了凯伦和大卫
She killed Karen and David.

119
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,130
她是为了防止病毒扩散
She was trying to stop it from spreading.

120
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,510
泰尔西很快就回来了
Tyreese is gonna be back here soon,

121
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,430
所以她还是离开比较好
so I didn't think she should be here.

122
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,860
而且我也不能留她
And I couldn't have her here.

123
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,450
她有车有供给
She has a car, supplies,

124
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,190
应该没问题
she'll figure it out.

125
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,000
我等下告诉你父亲  先别告诉其他人
I'll tell your dad. Don't tell anyone else yet.

126
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,850
好
Okay.

127
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,010
换做是你  你会带她回来吗
Would you have brought her back?

128
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,980
-她承认是她干的吗  -是的
- She said she did it? - Yeah.

129
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,310
那你让她走就是对的
Then you were right to send her away.

130
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
不知道我能不能做到
I don't know if I could have.

131
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,320
你可以做到  玛姬
You could have, Maggie.

132
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,590
更难的事你都做了
You've done harder things.

133
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,370
别怀疑自己  我们没这特权了
Don't doubt yourself. We don't get to anymore.

134
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,320
瑞克  行尸越来越多了
Rick, the cluster's getting

135
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,650
比推倒栅栏的那群还多
bigger than the one that took the fence down.

136
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,330
-我们得做点什么了  -我们会的
- We need to do something. - We will.

137
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,770
卡尔
Carl?

138
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,930
卡尔
Carl.

139
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,620
卡尔
Carl?

140
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,180
你还好吗
You okay?

141
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,190
我正想问你呢
I was gonna ask you that.

142
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,940
-我们很好  -没人生病吗
- We're fine. - No one's sick?

143
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,510
没有需要采取措施吧
You didn't have to do anything?

144
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,100
没遇到需要开枪的状况  爸
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.

145
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,410
朱迪思呢
And Judith?

146
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,140
她跟贝丝在一起
She's with Beth.

147
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,400
很好
Good.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,850
在外面找到了点食物
Found some food on the run.

149
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,020
这里有些水果干
There's a bunch of fruit leather in there.

150
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,400
吃完之后让大家把牙刷了
Have everybody brush their teeth after.

151
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,450
-我们很快能出去吗  -还不行
- Can we come out soon? - Not just yet.

152
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,970
爸  你暴露在病毒下的时候我在你身边  
Dad, I was around you when you were in the middle of it.

153
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,700
我也在帕特里克的身边
And I was around Patrick.

154
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,920
我没被传染  我能帮你
I didn't get it. I can help you.

155
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,800
谢了  但是我需要你待在这里
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.

156
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,430
我会的
I will.

157
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,510
但是
But,

158
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,160
爸  你不能让我避开
Dad, you can't keep me from it.

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,030
避开什么
From what?

160
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,300
总要发生的事
From what always happens.

161
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,530
是啊
Yeah.

162
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,010
也许吧
Maybe.

163
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,070
但我觉得我有责任试试看
But I think it's my job to try.

164
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,940
谢谢你
Thank you.

165
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,290
不客气
No problem.

166
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,500
让我们看看你的病情
Let's have a look at you.

167
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,070
医生是最差的病人
Doctors make the worst patients.

168
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,110
不是所有人都能活下去
Not everyone gets to live.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,110
晚期
End stage

170
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,160
就是病入膏肓
is a point that no one comes back from

171
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,380
无法好转
or they-- or they can't.

172
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,950
我现在就是晚期
That's where I am.

173
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,400
不  你得把精力放到能活下去的人的身上
No, you need to focus on the ones that can make it.

174
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,940
我又做了一些点滴
I made some more IVs.

175
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,580
如果你不准备好失去一个人
If you're not ready to lose one,

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,290
你就会失去他们所有人
you're gonna lose them all.

177
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,840
这就像是关灯一样
It's like turning off a light--

178
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,290
一盏一盏地灭掉
it'll happen one after the other.

179
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,270
而且他们还不止是死了这么简单
And they don't just die.

180
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,690
我们能挺过去的
We can hold on.

181
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,380
迦勒
Caleb.

182
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,060
迦勒
Caleb.

183
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,890
那个牢房区出事后
After what happened in the other cell block,

184
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,830
当我来这里时  我带来了这些
when I came in here, I brought these.

185
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,990
躺回床上去  我们的情况还没那么糟
Get back in bed now. We're not that bad off.

186
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,260
等真那么糟时
When we are,

187
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,480
就迟了
it'll be too late.

188
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,130
你不明白
You don't understand.

189
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,630
你还有生存机会
You have a chance.

190
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,090
但得了这病  我们已经死定了
This is it after this.

191
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,130
我不会放弃任何一个人的
I'm not giving up on anyone.

192
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,730
至少目前不会
Not yet.

193
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,250
确保每个人的门都关好了
Just make sure everyone's doors are shut.

194
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,570
迦勒
Caleb...

195
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,420
一定要确保
Just make sure!

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
迦勒  你得让我给你看看
Caleb, you've got to let me look at you.

197
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,960
好吧  赫谢尔
Okay, Hershel.

198
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,270
尽管看吧
Have a look.

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,850
喝了我留给你的茶
Drink the tea I left you.

200
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,260
我一小时之后回来看你
Gonna be back to check on you in an hour.

201
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,600
大家
Everyone,

202
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,950
回到你们的牢房里
get back in your cells.

203
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,370
快点  回你们的牢房里去
Go on, get back in your cells.

204
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,540
我们把他搬上来吧
Let's get him on this.

205
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,030
去休息吧
Go rest.

206
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,710
你能自己走回你的牢房吗
Can you make it to your cell?

207
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,550
? Go your way ?

208
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,200
? I'll take the long way 'round, ?

209
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,120
? I'll find my own way down ?

210
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,100
? As I should ?

211
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,640
? And hold your gates ?

212
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,300
? As croak in the midas touch ?

213
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,640
? A joke in the way that we rust ?

214
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,170
? And breathe again ?

215
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,050
赫谢尔
Hershel.

216
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,700
这是我们失去的第三个人了
Third one we've lost.

217
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,310
我们在牢区后面火化了他们
We're burning them behind the blocks.

218
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,750
火化了他们
Burning them.

219
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,770
只能这样了
That's what it's come to.

220
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,770
你还好吧
Are you okay?

221
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,100
我昨天还和他聊了斯坦贝克[小说家]
I talked to him yesterday about Steinbeck.

222
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,930
他还给我引用了一段
He told me a quote.

223
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,530
"一个悲伤的灵魂能比细菌
"A sad soul

224
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,770
让你死的更快"
can kill quicker than a germ."

225
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,290
所以不想让他们看见发生了什么
That's exactly why I didn't want them all to see what happens.

226
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,460
我知道他们知道
I know they know,

227
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,710
但我不想让他们看见这一幕
but I didn't want them to see it right now.

228
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,640
他们是在看着你呢  赫谢尔
They're seeing you, Hershel.

229
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,420
他们看的是你
They see you

230
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,460
坚持下去
keep going.

231
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,800
即使选择越来越少
Even after all the choices keep getting taken away.

232
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,680
等我们挺过去
When we get past this thing...

233
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,250
事情不会再像之前那样  对吗
it's not gonna be like how it was, is it?

234
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,230
不会
No.

235
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,230
那算是逃避吗
Was that denial?

236
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,080
对事实视而不见
Not seeing things for how they were?

237
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,390
不
No.

238
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,150
你只是需要缓缓
You just caught a break.

239
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,830
你需要点时间  休息了一下
You needed some time. You got some.

240
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,040
你运气好
You got lucky.

241
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,930
我们都是
We all did.

242
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,530
我还是认为这是上天的计划
I still think there's a plan.

243
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,070
我还是相信有个理由
I still believe there's a reason.

244
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,700
你认为这都是考验吗
You think it's all a test?

245
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,550
生活永远都是考验  瑞克
Life was always a test, Rick.

246
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,770
我得跟你说说卡萝尔的事
I need to talk to you about Carol.

247
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,040
挺住
Come on.

248
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,770
挺住  萨沙
Come on, Sasha.

249
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,910
你知道怎么战斗
You know how to fight.

250
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,310
坚持住
Just hold on.

251
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,260
坚持住  别放弃
Just hold on. Don't give up on me, now.

252
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,500
我刚跟你爸谈过了
I just talked to your dad.

253
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,030
总体来说  他看着还行
He looks good, all things considered.

254
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,750
如果卡尔病了  你会在那儿陪着他吗
If Carl were sick, would you be up there with him?

255
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,830
如果我认为自己能帮上忙的话
If I thought I could help.

256
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,520
你觉得我帮不上忙吗
You don't think I can help?

257
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,440
妈的
Damn.

258
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,440
我很庆幸你和我一起在外面
I'm just glad you're out here with me.

259
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,350
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

260
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,870
我昏过去了吗
I passed out?

261
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,570
你脱水了
You were dehydrated.

262
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,860
逞英雄消耗太大了吧
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.

263
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,980
你明白的
You should know.

264
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,830
我觉得你进来这里真是个笨蛋
I thought you were an idiot to come in here.

265
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,020
我以为你必死无疑
I mean, I was sure you were just gonna be a dead foolish man.

266
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,080
我不知道这算不算恭维
I can't tell if that's a compliment.

267
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,360
我不知道我在说什么
I don't know what I'm saying.

268
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,990
我一定是撞到头了
I must have hit my head.

269
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,260
我不相信魔法
I don't believe in magic

270
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,360
或是运气
or luck.

271
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,970
我精心计算
I do the math

272
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,160
从不赌运气
and I don't gamble.

273
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,420
但我不知道如果你不是那么笨
But I don't know if I'd be here right now

274
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,310
我现在是不是还能活着
if you weren't so damn stupid.

275
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,230
你知道吗
You know what?

276
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,880
我就当你是在恭维了
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

277
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,380
赫谢...
Hersh--

278
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,440
赫谢尔
Hershel--

279
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,420
我过一会儿再来看你
I'll check on you in a little while.

280
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,620
他怎么样

在睡觉
He's sleeping.

282
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,890
你自己也该休息会儿
You should get some rest yourself.

283
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,290
我不想离开他  说不定他会醒过来
I don't want to leave him in case he wakes up.

284
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,190
-要我看看他吗  -不用了
- Want me to take a look at him? - No.

285
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,490
让他睡觉就好
Just let him sleep.

286
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,510
赫谢尔
Hershel!

287
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,600

去吧
Go.

291
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,300
围栏更重要  我们得确保围栏坚挺不倒
The fence is more important. We need to keep it standing.

292
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,370
我来就行
I got this.

293
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,210
-你一个人做不来  -我知道  快去

你觉得他们还好吗

如果情况不妙  我们应该会听到更多枪响
If things were going bad, we would have heard more shots.

爸爸  我们怎么办
Dad, what do we do?

330
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,990
也许我能把车开来挡住围栏

拉回拉杆

? Go your way ?

381
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,890
? I'll take the long way 'round ?

382
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,920
? I'll find my own way down ?

383
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,190
? As I should ?

384
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:05,280
? And hold your gates ?

385
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,940
? As croak in the midas touch ?

386
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,210
? A joke in the way that we rust ?

387
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,660
? And breathe again ?

388
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,080
? And you'll find loss ?

389
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,050
