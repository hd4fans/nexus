. . .卡塞林戰役出了什麼事？我聽說一塌糊塗。

Apparently, everything went wrong.
顯然，似乎每件事都出了差錯。

153

We'd send over a 75-millimeter shell, the krauts would return an 88.
我們打出75毫米的炮彈，德軍就回敬88毫米的。

154
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:54,738
Their tanks are diesels.
他們用的是柴油機坦克。

子彈打進去後，只是在車裡撞來撞去。

I understand we had a little trouble coordinating the air cover.

史密斯將軍接通了，長官。
請原諒，布拉德。

Bedell?
比爾？

167
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:40,857
Listen, I'm calling about, uh, Bradley and his job here.
喔，我打電話是想談談，啊，布拉德利和他在這裡的工作問題。

啊，我需要一位副手，我想要布拉德利當我的副官，行嗎？

You clear it with Ike?
你能請示艾克批准嗎？

長官，帶了。
讓我們把它們戴上。

175
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:20,314
What's the matter, Brad? I've been nominated by the president.
布拉德，怎麼了？是總統親自提名的。

176
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:25,191
I know, but, uh, it doesn't become official until it's approved by the Senate.

我有沒有告訴你，那回我設計了坦克兵的制服？

喬治，我在卡塞林戰報裡還提到一件事。

Some of our boys were just plain scared.

Well, that's understandable.

197
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:11,664
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out.

A blind man could see it in a minute.
就連瞎子也能很快看出。

They don't look like soldiers, they don't act like soldiers.
他們不像當兵的，也不是當兵的料。

又怎麼能指望他們去打勝仗呢？

You're absolutely right. The discipline's pretty poor.
你說的對，他們紀律非常渙散。

In about 15 minutes, we're going to start turning these boys. . .
15分鐘後，我們要讓他們開始變得. . .

They'll lose their fear of the Germans.
讓他們見了德兵不再害怕，

Ike has turned it down.
艾克否決了它。

他認為，因為這是意大利人首次保衛自己國土. . .

564
01:02:56,589 --> 01:03:00,839

-Well, ah, where do my people land, then? 
-In the Gulf of Gela.
那麼，啊，我的部隊在哪裡登陸？  在基拉海灣。

566
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:07,169
What for? There's nothing there but a beach.
為什麼？那裡只有海灘

Ike had to consider all points of view.

He made his decision not as an American, but as an Ally.
他不是以美國人，而是以盟友的身份作出決定的。

如果是反過來，我確信蒙蒂一定會抗議。

顯然，他們在西西里有兩個唱主角的，蒙哥馬利和巴頓。

我想我是沒說清楚，長官。

請他們再發一遍。但你別急著去辦。

不過，至少那只是個人責備，而不是官方的。

...that Russia will have nothing to say.
...俄國將沒有發言權。

1107
01:56:16,363 --> 01:56:20,709
Congressional leaders like Senator Clayburn Foss are quick to react.
如同福斯參議員那樣的國會領袖迅速反應。

1108
01:56:20,792 --> 01:56:23,697
This man has insulted our Russian allies, . . .
此人侮辱了我們的俄國盟友，. . .

依我看來，他應該受到嚴厲的懲罰。

01:56:30,042 --> 01:56:32,217
None, no, Bedell. This time I didn't do a damn thing.
沒有，不，畢托，這次我什麼也沒做。

They promised me they wouldn't be any reporters there.
他們向我保證那裡沒有記者。

因此，我可以即興講演隨意說幾句，而不被報道。

Ike told you to keep your mouth shut. You won't listen.
艾克要你閉嘴，你就是不聽。

1115
01:56:40,467 --> 01:56:44,313

難道你真的不知道俄國人對英美有多麼懷疑嗎？

我不喜歡那些狗娘養的，但我會禮貌地提到他們。

1119
01:56:53,641 --> 01:56:56,891
Bedell, I don't know anything about politics, ... you know that.
畢托，我完全不懂政治 ... 你是知道的。

1120
01:56:56,963 --> 01:57:02,292
I have no political ambitions afterwar. All I want to do is command an army in combat.
我在戰後沒有政治野心。我只是想指揮部隊作戰！

1121
01:57:02,376 --> 01:57:04,673
Well, it's out of our hands, now.
算了，我現在已經控制不住了。

1122
01:57:04,733 --> 01:57:08,054
Ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff.
艾克昨晚送消息給了參謀總長。

It's just a question of waiting for the orders now.

No, sir.
不會的，長官。

1141
01:58:32,357 --> 01:58:34,821
God will not permit this to happen!
上帝怎能允許這種事情發生！

01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:40,686
I am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny!

01:58:58,385 --> 01:59:02,813
In the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted, ...

I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen on D-day or D-plus-10, and I said so.
我就知道蒙蒂無法在D日或其後10天攻佔戛納，我早就說過。

1151
01:59:32,972 --> 01:59:37,020
And here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country.
他們現在全困在樹籬地區。

1152

他們現應該折回向希里芬，像在第一次世界大戰中計劃的一樣。(First World War)

Then we might get a chance to do some real broken-field running.

除非他心裡有數，否則布拉德利將軍不會召您來的。

I'll tell you, Cod. I've learned my lesson.
聽我說，考德，我已經學乖了。

我會用胳膊輕輕碰您一下。
你應該用力朝屁股上踹我一腳！

1164
02:00:25,306 --> 02:00:27,151
Yes, sir.
遵命，長官！

Gennral. Welcome to France, sir.
將軍。歡迎來到法國，長官！

I'd give myself some leeway if I were you.
如果我是你的話，我會多給自己留些迴旋餘地。

But what about your men?
但是你的部下呢？

You can't cart them off 100 miles then expect them to attack without rest.
你不可能強行軍100英里，然後指望部隊不休整就立刻開始進攻！

02:25:09,790 --> 02:25:12,682
I trained these men, Arthur. They'll do what I tell them.
部隊是我帶出來的，亞瑟。他們會照我的命令去做。

啊，我們沒想到你這麼受部隊歡迎，將軍。

I'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers, . . .
並非是我受歡迎，他們這樣做全是因為他們是出色的士兵，. . .

喔，請允許我代表蒙哥馬利元帥發言。
