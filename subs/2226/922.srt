1
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,060
我们可以去车上待着...
We could jump in the car if...

2
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,980
在这儿等着
We'll wait.

3
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,360
-你给议员买生日礼物了吗  -没有
- Did you get the congressman anything for his birthday? - No.

4
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,110
我买了袖口  银质的  有他的...
I got him cufflinks. Silver, with his --

5
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,930
我们不谈论生日  不送礼物
We don't talk about birthdays. We don't do gifts.

6
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,920
为什么
Why not?

7
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,570
去把袖口退了吧
You should return the cufflinks.

8
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,470
道格
Doug?

9
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,620
我一直在给你打电话
Tried calling you.

10
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,930
-我把手机留在...  -我们得谈谈
- I left my phone in the... - We need to talk.

11
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,770
怎么了
What's going on?

12
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,240
克里斯蒂娜  我刚刚跟她谈过
Christina. I just spoke to her.

13
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,120
佐伊...
Did Zoe...?

14
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
是的  但还不止
Yeah. But that's not all. 

15
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,660
他们还找到了瑞秋
They tracked down Rachel, too.

16
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,190
弗兰西斯
Francis?

17
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,020
跟我说说瑞秋  她在哪
Tell me about Rachel. Where is she?

18
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,440
我控制住她了
I have her under control.

19
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,900
答非所问
That's not what I asked.

20
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,800
我送她回家了  不用担心她
I drove her home. We don't have to worry about her.

21
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,780
你当初也这么说斯克斯基
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky. 

22
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,110
还牵扯到别人了吗
Anyone else involved?

23
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,440
只有简宁和佐伊
Just Janine and Zoe. 

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,610
他们在查罗素被捕的事
They asked about Russo's arrest 

25
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,660
而且知道他去找过科佩尼科
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.

26
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,520
我想他们应该就知道这些了
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.

27
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,040
不要想当然
Assume nothing.

28
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,800
我去告诉巴尼·豪尔
I'll alert Barney Hull. 

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,990
拿佐伊怎么办
What do you want me to do about Zoe?

30
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,420
我对付佐伊
I'll handle Zoe. 

31
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,600
你去办事吧
Get to work.

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,590
是  先生
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,960
我拿走了
I emptied it. 

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,950
你周二就又老一岁了
You're another year older on Tuesday.

35
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,570
副总统可不能抽烟
And we can't have a vice president who smokes.

36
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,200
你能结束吗
Can you finish?

37
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
什么
What?

38
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
我完事了
I'm good.

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,560
你怎么了
What's wrong?

40
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,140
没什么  就是完事了
Nothing. I just said finish.

41
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,280
我不想...如果你不想...
Well, I don't want just -- if you're not...

42
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,820
好吧  随便了
Okay, fine. Whatever.

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,870
佐伊  是我做错了什么吗
Zoe, did I do something that made you...?

44
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,850
没有
No.

45
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,700
佐伊  你不能说一句完事了  然后就停下啊
Zoe, you can't say something like "just finish" and then shut down.

46
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,170
这里很安全  佐伊  我不是他
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

47
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,040
早上好  杰姬
Good morning, Jackie.

48
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,330
早上好
Good morning.

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,500
理查德·拉塞尔
Richard Russell.

50
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,500
{\an8}长期反对民权运动

51
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,900
1963年  《民权法案》
Civil Rights Act. 1963.

52
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,130
不是所有人都能青史留名
Not everyone can be on the right side of history.

53
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,780
连林登也曾站错队
No, not even Lyndon for a time,

54
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,410
但没有拉塞尔  林登也当不上多数党领袖
but he would have never become majority leader without him.

55
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,100
但是没有约翰逊参议院大楼
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.

56
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,100
{\an8}有拉塞尔参议院大楼

57
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,250
是啊  只能委屈他拿一栋总统图书馆凑合了
No. He had to settle for a presidential library.

58
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,430
我们都好久没聊聊了
So it's been some time since you and I have had a chance to catch up. 

59
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,170
你的工作做得很出色  杰姬
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie. 

60
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,010
比你那些老练的同事还高效
Far more effective than your more seasoned colleagues.

61
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,890
你能推动合作  必要时候还有股狠劲
You're a coalition builder, a fighter when you have to be. 

62
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,010
告诉我  你怎么看自己的前途
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?

63
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,570
我想做众议院军事委员会主席
I'd like to aim for the chair of Armed Services. 

64
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,030
或者众议院国土安全委员会主席
Or Homeland Security.

65
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,600
你考虑过进入领导层吗
Have you ever considered serving in the leadership?

66
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,540
我想那至少也得等八...十年了
I figure that might be possible eight, ten years from now.

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,110
如果我说你这一届就能进入领导层呢
Well, what if I suggested that you could serve in leadership this term. 

68
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,730
接替我  做党鞭
To replace me. As whip.

69
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,040
你要接任副总统了
You're being tapped for VP.

70
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
就算是这样吧
Let's assume that's true.

71
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,540
-这也说得通  但我做党鞭  -是的
- Well, that makes sense. But me as whip? - Yes.

72
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,960
我只是个第三任女议员
A third-term congresswoman? 

73
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,570
你的能力有目共睹  而且还参过战
A universally admired incumbent who also happens to be a war veteran.

74
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,220
按顺序也该是韦伯  或巴克沃特
Webb is next in line. Or Buchwalter.

75
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,540
所以  你考虑一下吧
So just consider that for a moment.

76
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
他们会牵制彼此的选票
They'll draw votes from one another.

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,980
我可没说你会赢得很轻松
Oh, I'm not saying you wouldn't have to fight for it,

78
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,060
但我愿意帮你
but I'd be willing to give you the ammunition. 

79
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,610
过来
Come over here.

80
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,230
这是什么
What is this?

81
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,770
我关于韦伯和巴克沃特的文件
My files on Webb and Buchwalter. 

82
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,970
你自己看看吧
Why don't you take a look? 

83
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,060
我们过几天再谈
We'll speak in a few days.

84
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,700
还有一个关于你的文件夹
Oh, and, uh, there's one on you. 

85
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,070
或许你会想先读那个
You might want to begin by reading that one first.

86
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,600
简宁怎么说
What'd Janine say?

87
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,320
脱衣舞俱乐部还没开
Strip club's not open yet. 

88
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,510
你去查科佩尼科的事吗
You'll look into Kapeniak?

89
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,330
如果他出现  我就能找到他
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,980
-送我去地铁中心站  -不去办公室吗
- Drop me at metro center. - Not the office?

91
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,340
我要去找瑞秋
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

92
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,560
她会像昨晚那样否认一切的
She'll deny everything, like she did last night.

93
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,240
她不能否认上了斯坦普的车  你看到她了
She can't deny getting into Stamper's car. You saw her.

94
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,350
或许你可以写一篇关于她爸爸的事的报道
Maybe you send a version of the story, about her dad?

95
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,380
没人会发表的
No one would print it.

96
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,050
可瑞秋不知道啊
Rachel doesn't know that.

97
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,060
她说"随你便  贱人"
She said, "Go to town, bitch." 

98
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,030
不会管用的  我得当面跟她谈
It won't work. I have to get in her face.

99
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,280
恭喜
Congratulations.

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
-我们都替你高兴  -谢谢
- We're thrilled for you. - Thank you.

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,960
我想亲自跟鲍勃和泰瑞说
I wanted to fill in Bob and Terry personally.

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,950
我们快开始吧  我什么时候出发去匹兹堡
Now let's get to it. I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?

103
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,870
20分钟后
20 minutes.

104
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,880
帮吉姆冲刺  就要到终点了
Home stretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

105
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,960
现在形势很好
Looking good out there.

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,840
的确  但我们还是不想冒险
Very good. But we don't want to take any chances. 

107
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,750
接替你的党鞭人选  弗兰克
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.

108
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,470
鲍勃已经提出了一些想法
Bob has already shared some thoughts.

109
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,510
我喜欢霍华德·韦伯
I like Howard Webb.

110
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,470
韦伯不错  你考虑过韦斯·巴克沃特吗
Webb is a solid choice. Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

111
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,880
巴克沃特太冲动
Buchwalter's a hot-head.

112
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,950
那么韦伯你觉得可以吗  弗兰克
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?

113
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,550
韦伯懂战术  但做事虎头蛇尾
Webb is a good tactician, but he lacks follow-through.

114
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,200
巴克沃特是个粗人
The problem with Buchwalter is he's too abrasive. 

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,770
毫无魅力  树敌太多
No charm. Lots of enemies.

116
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,740
还有别的选择吗
Is there a third option?

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,040
他们是党团资历最深的两位  轮到他们了
They're the two most senior members in the caucus. It's their turn.

118
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,500
总统先生  可不可以让党内成员一起挑选
Mr. President, what if we let the caucus pick?

119
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,020
大家公平竞争  他们两人都很有资质
Let it be a wide-open race. Both men are qualified.

120
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,810
领导层在这事上要意见一致
The leadership should be united in this.

121
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,650
我们不能各自支持不同的候选人  弗兰克
We don't want to be backing different candidates, Frank.

122
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,930
那我们就干脆别插手  谁都不支持
So we stay out of it and neither of us backs anyone.

123
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,610
这挺好
I like it. 

124
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,780
党团会尊重凭实力竞争上来的人
Caucus will respect someone who did it the old-fashioned way.

125
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,020
几位  这事你们做主
Well, gentlemen, it's your call to make.

126
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,310
你们自己讨论决定  然后告诉我
Figure it out amongst yourselves. Let me know what you decide.

127
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,540
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,040
帮我接刘易斯部长
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

129
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,240
弗兰克  我不想为这事跟你争
Frank, I don't want to go to battle with you on this.

130
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,300
我们犯过这种错
We've been down that road.

131
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,560
说得是啊
I couldn't agree more.

132
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,910
公平竞争让我紧张
An open race makes me nervous.

133
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,970
我只是提议一下
Well, look, it was just a suggestion.

134
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,960
-我再想想吧  -谢谢
- I'll put some thought into it. - Thank you.

135
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,650
我去做做他的工作吧
You know, let me -- let me go work on him.

136
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,880
祝你好运了
Good luck.

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,380
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

138
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,940
问我要点什么
Ask me what I want to order.

139
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,460
想好点什么了吗  先生
Have you decided, sir?

140
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,540
你马上辞职  告诉里昂你不干了
I need you to quit your job. Tell Leon it's your last day.

141
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,950
为什么
Why?

142
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,410
表现自然点
Act normal.

143
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,280
要什么配菜
Did you want a side with that?

144
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,610
他们能找到你一次
They found you once. 

145
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,390
不能冒险让你再被找到
We can't take the chance they'll find you again.

146
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,090
那钱的事怎么办
What am I supposed to do about money?

147
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,370
照我说的做  回家  收拾东西
Do as I say. Go home and pack your things.

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,410
我十点过来
I'll come by around ten.

149
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,220
-那我就无权决定...  -够了
- Well -- but I don't get a say in any... - Stop it.

150
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,100
只收拾一个箱子
One suitcase. That's it.

151
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,230
-你至少也告诉我...  -我要肉馅土豆馅饼
- Can you at least tell me... - I'll take the shepherd's pie

152
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,160
配菜要球芽甘蓝
with a side of Brussels sprouts.

153
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,300
带走
To go.

154
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,860
我们不想上法庭  她的律师不想上法庭
We don't want a trial. Her lawyers don't want a trial. 

155
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,050
但科尔女士就是不听劝
But Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.

156
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,330
即便如此  如果你再给我点时间
That said, if you give me a little more time, I think that --

157
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,810
如果她想上法庭  那就随她
If she wants to go to court, then let's give her that.

158
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,170
虽然她现在不肯讲理  不代表将来...
Just because she's being unreasonable now doesn't mean she --

159
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,150
我受够了
I'm done.

160
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,600
这就是膝跳反应
That's a knee-jerk reaction. 

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,750
我知道你不是个不理智不耐心的人
I've never known you to be a person who was irrational or impatient.

162
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,110
我再去找找她的律师  或许我们...
Let me check back with her lawyers, and maybe we can --

163
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,040
最早什么时候能知道开庭日期
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,580
克莱尔
Claire...

165
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,340
给我个大致时间
Give me a timeframe.

166
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,520
最早也六个月后吧
Six months, at the earliest.

167
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,960
转告她那边  然后就中止沟通
Inform her people, then no more communication.

168
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,630
作为你的律师  我有责任强烈建议你不要这么做
As your counsel, it is my duty to strongly advise you against this.

169
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,760
我明白  谢谢你  奥利弗
I understand and I thank you, Oliver. 

170
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,990
谢谢
Thank you.

171
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,830
-怎么样  -他们不肯透露私人联络方式
- So? - They wouldn't give me individual contact info,

172
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,870
但这里是过去三年在东非工作过的
but here's every doctor who served in east Africa 

173
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,200
所有医生的名单
during the last three years.

174
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,490
健康维护组织呢
And what about the HMO?

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,490
{\an8}收取固定预付费用后  为特定地区主动参保人群提供全面医疗服务的体系

176
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,150
需要同意书  也在袋子里了
You need a consent form. And it's in the packet.

177
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,530
{\an8}私人医师  东非

178
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,060
{\an8}大卫·阿普博姆医生

179
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,790
有事吗
Can I help you?

180
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,710
我找瑞秋·波斯纳
Yeah. I'm looking for Rachel Posner.

181
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,450
她不在
She's not here.

182
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,360
她晚些时候会来吗
Uh, is she coming in later?

183
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
干什么
Why?

184
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,890
我认识她
I know her.

185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,590
你朋友可把我害惨了
Well, your friend really screwed me over.

186
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,860
怎么回事
What happened?

187
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
她上班上到一半就跑了
She took off, middle of her shift.

188
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,830
我不得不去找我的房东来帮忙
I had to put my hostess on wait staff duty.

189
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,430
我有点担心  瑞秋有麻烦
Look, I'm concerned. Rachel's in real trouble.

190
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,540
我才不管她的私人问题呢
I don't care what her personal issues are.

191
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,800
我只想知道她住哪
I just need to know where she lives.

192
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,830
你们不是认识吗
I thought you knew her.

193
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,820
我们认识  但有日子没见了
I do. It's just been a while. 

194
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,250
她给我发短信说她想自残
And she sent me a text message saying she wants to hurt herself.

195
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,050
现在又不接电话
And now she won't answer her phone. 

196
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,990
她有精神病史
She has a history of mental illness. 

197
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,140
你得帮帮我啊
You've gotta help me out.

198
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,580
我帮不了
Look, I can't. 

199
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,750
她的工资和税务报表  上面的地址是个邮箱
Her W-2, the address is a P.O. Box.

200
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,340
有什么都行
I'll take whatever I can get.

201
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,650
-我去办公室帮你看看  -谢谢
- Let me see what I got in the office. - Thank you.

202
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,110
如果你找的她  叫她别回来了
If you find her, you tell her not to come back.

203
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,770
我才不需要疯子来我这儿捣乱
I don't need some nutcase creating chaos in here.

204
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,950
-南茜  -是  先生
- Nancy? - Yes, sir?

205
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000

Is Doug back yet?

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,260
在办公室  还有
In his office. And, sir?

207
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
我们开始收到生日贺卡了  还有几件礼物
Birthday cards have started to arrive. A few presents.

208
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,710
写感谢信  记录礼物  贵重的...

209
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,530

212
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,480
你知道怎么处理贺卡
And you know what to do with the cards.

213
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,510
当然
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,210
我今晚去接她
I'm picking her up tonight.

215
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,220
我在乔帕都安排好了
I got everything set up for her in Joppa.

216
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,090
那是哪里
Where's that?

217
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,660
马里兰  巴尔的摩北30分钟路程
Maryland. About 30 minutes north of Baltimore.

218
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,950
太近了
That's close to home.

219
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,820
我们想让她消失  但我们得能找到她
We want her to disappear, but not on us.

220
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,870
-好吧  一次性电话买好了吗  -嗯
- Fine. Do you have the burner? - Yeah.

221
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,440
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

222
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,570
预付款的  你只要开机拨号就行
It's prepaid. All you need to do is turn it on and dial.

223
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,440
电话记录还得处理掉
We still have the phone history.

224
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,830
所以日后更要小心了
All the more reason to be safe going forward.

225
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,250
克里斯蒂娜怎么样了
Where are we with Christina?

226
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,190
我在办
I'm on it. 

227
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,010
安排她去琳达手下  我今早打过电话了
Linda's office. I called her this morning.

228
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,610
你是吉莉安·科尔吗
Are you Gillian Cole?

229
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,170
是的  我们认识吗
Yeah. Uh, have we met?

230
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,960
没有  但你认识我丈夫
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,970
你丈夫
Your husband?

232
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,390
大卫·阿普博姆
David Applebaum. 

233
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,840
看来是真的喽
So it's true.

234
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,260
那只是个错误
It was a mistake.

235
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,830
你想看看我们的孩子吗  我可以给你看看照片
You want to see our kids? I can show you pictures.

236
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,160
阿普博姆太太  我...
Mrs. Applebaum, I -- I'm...

237
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,420
你以为你是谁啊
Who the fuck do you think you are?

238
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,660
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

239
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,840
你抱歉  我觉得你并不抱歉
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry. 

240
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,290
而且你也休想
And don't think for a second 

241
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,990
凭这个孩子来向我们要钱
you're gonna use that baby to get money out of us.

242
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,550
他根本不知道我怀孕了
He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

243
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,570
但你知道他是有妇之夫
But you knew he was married. 

244
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,780
你怎么能这样
How could you?

245
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,380
-他说起过我们吗  -没有
- Did he talk about us? - No.

246
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,910
说谎的婊子  我让你难堪了吗
Lying bitch. Am I embarrassing you? 

247
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,730
你想过这对我和我孩子的羞辱吗
Did you think about how you would humiliate me and my kids? 

248
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,820
再跟别人老公上床记得戴套
Use a condom the next time you fuck somebody's husband.

249
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,740
还不到24个小时
It's been less than 24 hours. 

250
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,700
她正在上班就突然辞职了
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?

251
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,590
她害怕了
She's scared. 

252
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,920
换了我也会跑
I'd take off, too. 

253
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,190
是安德伍德
It's Underwood. 

254
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,950
他行动比我们快
He's moving faster than we are.

255
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,380
脱衣舞女呢
What about the stripper?

256
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,180
不肯开口
Refuses to talk.

257
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,390
科佩尼科呢
Kapeniak?

258
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,790
住址不详  没兄弟姐妹  父母双亡
No current address. No siblings. Parents are dead.

259
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,980
瑞秋是唯一的机会
Rachel's the last loose end.

260
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,040
除了酒驾  她肯定还知道点别的
She must know something else. Bigger than the DUI.

261
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,630
知道她去哪了吗
Any idea where she went?

262
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,130
有个杜邦的邮箱地址  但管理员都没见过她
I got a P.O. Box in Dupont, but none of the clerks have seen her.

263
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,840
我可以去那里守株待兔
I could go stake it out, but...

264
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,700
你找过你的人了吗
Have you talked to your guy yet?

265
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,070
明后天吧
In the next day or two. 

266
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,820
他会把罗素自杀的警方报告拿给我
He's bringing me the police report on Russo's suicide.

267
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,050
我尽量多套些信息
I'll press him for more.

268
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,610
你下一步怎么办
And what's your next move?

269
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,700
想想怎么回复这个
Trying to figure out how to respond to this.

270
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,870
{\an8}周一下午三点  地点你定

271
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,980
几个小时前收到的
I got it a couple hours ago.

272
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,250
他是在给你下套
I think he's setting her up.

273
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,950
我知道怎么应付他
I know how to handle him.

274
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,100
他知道的越少越好
The less he learns, the better.

275
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,270
我们也许能打探到消息
We might learn something.

276
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,450
是他说了算  怎么打探
Not with him calling the shots.

277
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,760
地点是我定
I'm choosing the place.

278
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,740
有什么区别
As if that makes a difference.

279
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,220
我又不会跟他上床  就是谈话
I'm not gonna fuck him. Just talk to him.

280
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,250
我去下洗手间
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

281
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,860
-抱歉  我不该  -没关系
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -- - That's okay.

282
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,020
有关系
No, it's not.

283
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,160
我不希望你疏忽大意
I just don't want you to be careless.

284
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,320
不会的
I won't be.

285
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,910
你不想有自己的生活
You want no life? 

286
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,180
想一个人做三个人的工作吗
You want more work than three people can handle? 

287
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,160
你想找个第一个月
You want a decent chance 

288
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,680
就可能被炒的工作吗
that you could be fired within the first month?

289
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,410
如果你感兴趣  咱就接着谈
If that tempts you, we can keep talking.

290
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,830
那些都不是问题
None of that intimidates me. 

291
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,710
过去九周里我都在管理一个选区
I've been running a congressional district for the past nine weeks 

292
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,350
而且没人帮我
with zero assistance.

293
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,740
没人选举我
Nobody elected me. 

294
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,980
没人教我怎么做
Nobody taught me. 

295
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,130
我那么做是因为总得有人来做
I've done it because somebody had to.

296
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,850
罗素的事是个悲剧
What happened was tragic. 

297
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,070
可我不会同情你
But you won't get sympathy from me. 

298
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,790
我没有时间
I don't have time for it.

299
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,200
我要是想博取同情  也不会到这儿来
I wouldn't be sitting here if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

300
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,440
瑞秋
Rachel?

301
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,620
走开
Leave.

302
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,870
我说走开
I said leave.

303
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
打包好了吗
Are you packed?

304
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,540
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

305
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,950
你今天没辞职
So you didn't quit today.

306
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
辞了  可我改主意了
I did, but I changed my mind.

307
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,410
这事由不得你
This isn't your decision to make.

308
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,930
我要回去工作  继续住这儿
I'm keeping my job and I'm keeping this apartment.

309
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,270
不行
No, you're not.

310
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
你答应过  会让这些都过去
You promised you'd make all of this go away.

311
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,050
所以你得重新开始
And you starting over is the first --

312
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,040
我已经重新开始了  不想再来一次了
No, I already started over. I don't want to start over again.

313
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,970
我也不想你这样
I wish you didn't have to.

314
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,670
滚出去
Get out.

315
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,640
滚出去
Get out!

316
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,050
小点声
Lower your voice.

317
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,350
我杀了你
I'll fucking kill you.

318
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,240
动手吧
Go ahead.

319
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,880
只有我能保护你  你还不明白吗
I am the only one who can protect you. Don't you see that?

320
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,250
你不知道自己现在多危险
You have no idea how much danger you're in.

321
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,110
收拾东西吧
Start packing.

322
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,860
我每年都得问一句
You know I ask every year.

323
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,540
不过生日  像往年一样
Nothing, as usual.

324
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,810
我们可以吃顿晚餐
I thought we could have dinner.

325
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,880
除非是去个没人会认出我们的地方
Only if it's someplace where nobody will recognize us.

326
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,840
我不想谁走过来...
I don't want anyone walking up --

327
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,560
我是说在家  我可以做点菜
I mean at home. I'll cook something.

328
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,880
不要蛋糕
No cake.

329
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,470
不买蛋糕
No cake.

330
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,310
不要礼物
No gifts.

331
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,380
不买礼物
No gifts.

332
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,480
那行  诉讼怎么样了
I can do that. How's the lawsuit coming?

333
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,640
我们不会有事的
We'll be fine.

334
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,560
我们打算将您的安保规模
We'd like to increase the size of your detail

335
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,110
增至国家元首级别  从明天开始
to full head of state status, starting tomorrow.

336
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,810
这可不行
Well, that won't be happening.

337
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,760
提前准备总是没错的
It's good to get a head start,

338
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,020
这样等他们宣布...
so that by the time they announce --

339
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,030
在我彻底失去隐私之前就剩这几天了
These are my last few days before I never have privacy again.

340
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,570
我要尽量好好享受这几天
I intend to savor these moments for as long as I can.

341
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,130
但是先生  出于安全考虑  我认为...
But, sir, in terms of safety, I think --

342
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,860
在正式宣布由我接任副总统之前
Until I'm confirmed as the Vice President,

343
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,310
安保问题仍是我来决定  对吗
security is at my discretion. Is that correct?

344
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,270
理论上是的  但是...
Technically, yes. But --

345
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,540
那不就得了
Then that's settled.

346
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,190
那好吧  我们等正式宣布
All right. We'll wait until the announcement.

347
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,150
那么  正式宣布之后
Now, assuming the confirmation goes through,

348
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,750
我们就要解决您搬入
we'll need to work out the logistics 

349
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,910
海军天文台的后勤工作
of moving you into the Naval Observatory.

350
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,910
{\an8}天文台地界内的"天文台一号圈"为美国副总统官邸

351
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,600
这也不行
That won't be happening, either.

352
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,990
议员会继续住在他的别墅里
The congressman will be remaining in his townhouse.

353
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,940
但那里没有必要的安保基建
But it doesn't have the necessary security infrastructure.

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,410
那你们就去建啊
Then you'll need to build it.

355
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,510
要建防爆设施
We're talking blast-proofing,

356
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,450
固定线路通信网络  24小时办公室空间
hardwired communications networks, 24-hour office space --

357
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,420
有志者事竟成
Where there's a will, there's a way.

358
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,700
我会直接跟你联络  讨论改建计划
I'll contact you directly about setting a plan in motion.

359
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,740
你走之前  还有件事
And one last thing before you go.

360
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,890
把艾德华·密查姆安排在我的安保队伍里
I'd like to have Edward Meechum serve on my detail.

361
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,080
他是国会警察
He's Capitol Police.

362
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
目前是  你要派他去特勤处
For now. You're about to appoint him to the Secret Service.

363
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,670
那得经过加速训练培训
That would require an accelerated training program. 

364
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,590
先生  我们有很多合格的特工
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents.

365
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,230
有男有女  都有丰富经验
Men and women with years of experience.

366
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,770
我很期待与他们合作
And I look forward to working with all of them, 

367
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,860
只要艾德华·密查姆也是安保队一员就行
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail. 

368
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,630
多谢你前来
Thank you very much for your time.

369
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,090
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

370
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,820
{\an8}佐伊·巴恩斯  石溪公园

371
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,820
{\an8}我就来

372
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,510
南茜  让密查姆把车开过来
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.

373
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,430
上一次就是最后一次
You know, the last time was the last time.

374
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,400
我知道  但这很重要
I know. But this is important.

375
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,570
你总想拉我下水  我不干了
You keep selling me that swampland. I'm done buying.

376
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,060
再也不干了
No more.

377
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,250
掩盖案件的事  你说能牵扯到巴尼·豪尔
Cover-up. You said it went as high as Barney Hull.

378
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,520
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said.

379
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,800
你把瑞秋·波斯纳的拘捕记录给我时...
When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file --

380
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,670
我说的是  肯定有大人物干预  记录才会消失
What I said is that arrests don't disappear without a big-ass wand.

381
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,040
那可不能当做证据
That ain't the same as proof.

382
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,950
我们认为这事牵扯到议会领导层
We think the congressional leadership took part.

383
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,780
我才不关心
I don't care.

384
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,960
不  你关心  我知道你关心的
Yes, you do. I know you do.

385
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,390
不  我真的不关心
No, I really don't.

386
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,630
当年你帮我暴露毒品...
When you helped me expose the drug --

387
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,230
他们不过是拿点小恩小惠的街头黑警
They were dirty street cops stuffing a few grams in their pockets.

388
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,790
这事可不一样  都是有权有势的大人物
This is different. Powerful fucking people.

389
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,860
黑警就是黑警  你想保护他们吗
Dirty cops are dirty cops. You want to protect them?

390
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,060
我还有养老保险和家人
I have a pension and a family.

391
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,890
我明白  但是...
I understand. But --

392
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,740
不要再联系我了
Don't contact me again.

393
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,630
{\an8}死者坐在车子的副驾座上

394
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}卢卡斯·古德温至佐伊·巴恩斯  警方报告说罗素是在副驾座上

395
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}佐伊·巴恩斯  还有别的吗

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}卢卡斯·古德温  没了

397
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}佐伊·巴恩斯  这证明不了什么

398
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}卢卡斯·古德温  他怎么没在正驾座上

399
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,860
{\an8}佐伊·巴恩斯  不聊了

400
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,740
你的手机在哪
Where's your cell?

401
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,730
这里  我没在录音
Here. It's not recording.

402
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,560
你得删掉我们之间所有的通话记录
I need to ask you to delete all of our phone history.

403
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,540
我为什么要删掉
Why would I do that?

404
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,460
我这是在保护我们两个人
I'm trying to protect both you and I.

405
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,880
要坐牢的又不是我
I'm not facing prison.

406
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,410
他酒驾不是你替他掩盖的吗
You didn't cover up the arrest?

407
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,080
是不是因为你想让他竞选州长
Is it because you wanted him to be governor?

408
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,150
不是  他惹了麻烦  我就伸了援手
No. He was in trouble, so I helped.

409
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,180
之后他表现出参选意愿  我就提供了指导
And later he expressed a desire to run, and I offered guidance.

410
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,490
指导一个酒鬼吗
To an alcoholic?

411
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,110
他当时戒了酒  正在恢复中
To a sober recovering alcoholic.

412
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,240
你是指望他会自毁前程吗
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

413
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,150
当然不是
Absolutely not.

414
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,970
他没戏了  马修斯才来参选
It got Matthews in the race.

415
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,640
我愿意支持有上进心的人
I like to back people who want to succeed.

416
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,460
比如说你自己
Take yourself as an example.

417
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,410
你不过是渔翁得利
You just took advantage of the situation.

418
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,620
得利的是马修斯  我没非要当副总统啊
Matthews took advantage. I didn't seek the nomination.

419
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,620
罗素死的时候坐在副驾座上
Russo was in the passenger seat when he died.

420
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,170
这话不准确
That's not entirely accurate.

421
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,220
我看过警方报告
I saw the police report.

422
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,140
我还直接和警局局长谈过呢
And I spoke to the commissioner directly,

423
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,640
因为我关心彼得  我想了解全部细节
because I cared about Peter and I wanted to know the full story.

424
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,130
那他没坐在副驾座上吗
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

425
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,430
副驾座的车门开着  他半边身子躺在外面
The passenger door was open, and he was halfway out.

426
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,320
警方认为  他可能中途后悔了
They think that... he might have had second thoughts.

427
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,240
如果我去问巴尼·豪尔  他会证实你的话吗
If I speak to Barney Hull, he'll confirm that?

428
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,700
你什么意思  佐伊
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

429
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,200
也许有人谋杀了他
Maybe there was foul play.

430
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,580
要是有任何谋杀的迹象
If there was a hint of foul play,

431
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,660
你觉得警方会不去调查吗
don't you think the police would have investigated?

432
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
就这些掩盖他酒驾的警察吗
The same police that buried his DUI?

433
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,910
你认为我也脱不了干系
And you think I was involved.

434
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,670
你们之间有联系
There's a connection between you.

435
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,560
听听你在说什么  荒唐至极
listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

436
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,980
我只是问问而已
I'm just asking questions.

437
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,310
不  你这是在瞎猜  瞎联系
No, you're connecting dots that don't exist.

438
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,360
你想让我别插手  装作什么都不知道
You want me to just walk away? Act as if I don't know anything?

439
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,750
没错  是我替彼得解了围
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam. 

440
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,810
没错  我让他去找科佩尼科
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.

441
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,830
但除此之外  就没别的了
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.

442
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,500
别怪我  但现在我实在没法相信你的话
Can you blame me if I find it difficult to trust you right now?

443
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,900
信不信随你
Trust me or not, 

444
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,780
我很快就要被正式任命为副总统了
but I'm about to be confirmed as the vice president.

445
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,340
我们的合作关系已经延伸到总统层面了
And our relationship extends to the Oval Office now.

446
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,110
别无缘无故地没事找事
Don't step out of the sunlight for no reason. 

447
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,570
让我们忘记过去  展开新的合作
Let's start this new chapter with a clean slate. 

448
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,910
你回去好好想想  我会联系你
Now you sleep on that, and I'll be in touch.

449
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,840
我们先做血液和激素检测
We'll start with blood and hormone tests. 

450
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
结果几天之内就能出来
Those results should be back within a few days. 

451
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,520
如果结果不错
If they're good,

452
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,220
我们就开始对你和你丈夫进行基因检测
we'll move on to genetic testing for both you and your husband. 

453
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,170
你和他谈过了吗
Have you spoken to him yet?

454
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,510
还没有  我想先做检测
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.

455
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,400
这周什么时间做都可以
We can do those anytime this week.

456
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,270
我会让我的人跟你这边联络
I'll have my office call yours.

457
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,740
差点忘了
I almost forgot.

458
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,860
我上网做了些研究
I've been doing some research on the Internet.

459
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,670
网上的话不能都信啊
Be careful of the Internet.

460
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,770
我在搜索四十岁以上孕妇的
Well, I was looking into common issues

461
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,790
孕期常见问题时
associated with post-40 pregnancies,

462
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,710
查到了一个药物
and this drug came up. 

463
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,010
但是没查到什么详细信息  它叫静脉
But there wasn't much on it. It's Cruvenae...

464
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,860
静脉雌酮
Cruvenae-tenuestrin. 

465
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,800
你没找到详细信息是因为这种药
You probably haven't found much because it's,

466
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,440
还处在测试阶段
still in the beta stage.

467
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,160
这药物有什么疗效
And what does it do?

468
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,100
它能促进胎盘的血液流动
It helps maximize blood flow to the placenta. 

469
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,790
此前还没有哪种药物能做到这一点
Until CVT there hasn't been any viable drug for that. 

470
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,860
这药目前仍有争议
The jury's still out.

471
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,590
但是各年龄段的女性都可能患上胎盘机能不全
But placental insufficiency affects women of all ages. 

472
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,740
你现在先别担心这个
I wouldn't worry about it for now. 

473
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,140
我们还是按部就班  慢慢来
That's putting the cart way before the horse.

474
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,010
马修斯已经稳操胜券
You know, Matthews has this locked up, 

475
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,480
但是国会保守人士认为
but conservatives on the hill are saying 

476
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,330
他这次重回州长之位  还会像从前一样
he's gonna return to Harrisburg with the same myopic, 

477
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,170
目光短浅  增加赤字
deficit-growing mentality.

478
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,090
至于马修斯获胜后接任副总统的人选
Now, as to who's gonna replace Matthews when he wins...

479
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,360
我把墙灯关上不碍事吧
Can I at least turn off the overhead?

480
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,480
当然没事
Of course.

481
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
...还能有谁在财政上更恣意妄为...
...someone even more fiscally irresponsible...

482
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,320
需要我去楼下工作吗
Do you want me to go work downstairs?

483
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,010
不用  没事  给我腾个地方就行
No. That's fine. Just make some room.

484
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,450
你还没表态呢
You haven't said a word.

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,020
是的
No.

486
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,790
那我们怎么办
Where does that leave us?

487
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,510
我完全准备好了
I'm fully prepared.

488
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,700
早就蓄势待发了
And I have been for some time.

489
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,670
我知道你会做出你认为最好的决定
I know you'll do whatever you think is best.

490
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,760
但是安德伍德确认了
But Underwood confirmed it.

491
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,450
他将被推举为副总统
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

492
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,430
那对我们一点帮助也没有
That doesn't get us any closer.

493
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,990
我们知道罗素的死给马修斯扫清了障碍
Well, we know that Russo cleared the way for Matthews.

494
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,970
只能印证理论  但不是证据
It reinforces the theory. It doesn't give us proof.

495
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,100
我们不能指责他耍卑鄙手段
We can't go after the guy for playing dirty.

496
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,890
那根本不算新闻
That's not news.

497
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,580
国会里一半的混蛋都在耍手段
Half the fuckers in Congress play dirty.

498
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,670
他扶持一个假候选人  就为到时搞垮他
He propped up a sham candidate, just to take him down.

499
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,130
那天晚上没人强迫罗素喝酒
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.

500
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,210
那家伙本来就是个酒鬼
The guy was an alcoholic.

501
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,540
好吧  除了三天后他自杀了
Okay, we don't know what happened that night,

502
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,780
关于那晚我们一无所知
other than three days later he killed himself.

503
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,130
你还会再联系他吗
Are you gonna contact him again?

504
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,130
我不知道
I don't know.

505
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,200
我们得放慢进度
We need to slow down,

506
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,250
退一步重新考虑
take a step back, and reevaluate.

507
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,860
我们已经让瑞秋溜走了
We already let Rachel slip away.

508
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,360
除非掌握更多信息  否则都是徒劳
There's no point until we have more.

509
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,080
我们应该让他去猜  而不是
We should keep him guessing, not --

510
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
等等  从哪里掌握更多信息  从谁那里
Wait-- have more from where? From who?

511
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,410
我不知道
I don't know.

512
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,760
但我们应该先尝试别的办法
But we should exhaust all options

513
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,510
让佐伊再去联系安德伍德只是下策
before Zoe reaches back out to Underwood.

514
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,690
那会显得我们太心急
It looks desperate.

515
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,540
{\an8}但我们别无选择
But we don't have any options.

516
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,250
{\an8}我们已经撞南墙了
We are up against a brick wall. 

517
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,530
除非安德伍德
And unless Underwood--

518
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,950
佐伊
Zoe...?

519
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,120
我需要一个人想想
I just need to think.

520
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,730
大家一起讨论吧
Well, let's think about it together.

521
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,930
明天给你打电话
I'll call you tomorrow.

522
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,910
弗莱迪
Freddy?

523
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,030
怎么了  弗兰克
Yeah, Frank?

524
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,620
今早的肋排是不是有什么不同
Was there something different about these ribs this morning?

525
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,240
更好吃了还是难吃了
Better or worse?

526
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,450
我本以为你的肋排是美味到极致了
I didn't think that they could get any better,

527
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,040
不过今天的真是不同凡响
but these were something special.

528
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,850
换了一个新屠夫
Well, tried a new butcher.

529
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,650
他慢慢地给猪放血
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

530
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,400
这屠宰方法不合法  但是...
It ain't legal, but...

531
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,160
我不会告诉别人的
Well, I won't tell anyone.

532
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,670
我不知道还会不会再去他那里买肉
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.

533
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,290
我去他的店
Went out to his shop.

534
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,710
店后有个房间
He's got a room in the back

535
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,800
他就在那里杀猪
where he does it.

536
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,960
房间是隔音的  里面装备齐全
Soundproof. A whole setup.

537
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,790
为什么要弄成隔音的
W-- why soundproof?

538
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,040
因为猪叫得太厉害
'Cause of how they scream.

539
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,310
它们能嗅到死神来临的气息
They can smell it coming.

540
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,750
往它们的喉咙里插根管子
You stick that pipe in their throat,

541
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,210
接下来的十分钟简直生不如死
the next 10 minutes is hell.

542
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,700
你的鼓膜都能被震破
Bust your fucking eardrums.

543
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,260
人性化的方式是速战速决
Now, the humane way to do it is to make it quick.

544
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,860
装作喂食那样提一桶泔水来  然后  砰
Bring out a bucket of slop like it's feeding time and -- -- bam.

545
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,400
对准后脑勺来上一锹
Shovel right to the base of the head.

546
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,380
猪一声也不会吭
No screaming.

547
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,830
博奇同意公开竞争  但他说的很清楚
He's willing to open up the race, but Birch was very clear:

548
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,870
如果他不能支持谁  你也不行
if he can't endorse anyone, you can't either.

549
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,070
很公平
That's fair.

550
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,990
你真的希望巴克沃特胜选
You really want Buchwalter to win?

551
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,690
我希望最优秀的人能胜选
I want the best man to win.

552
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,630
谨小慎微的废话  说了等于没说
That sounds like a cagey bullshit non-answer to me.

553
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,890
我不想插手这件事情  泰瑞
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.

554
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,990
什么事你不插手  弗兰克
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.

555
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,560
回头见
I'll see you around.

556
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,010
{\an8}未知号码  我们能重新开始了吗

557
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,330
克莱尔  你不回我电话
Claire. You wouldn't return my calls.

558
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,130
我就回来
I'll be back.

559
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,690
我的律师说我不应该再和你接触
My attorney said that I shouldn't be in contact with you.

560
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,870
蓝十字会告诉我保险被取消了
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.

561
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,870
{\an8}为会员及其家属提供住院等医疗保险的非赢利组织

562
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,110
解雇金条款里规定了一年的健康保险
The severance package gave me health coverage for up to a year.

563
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,760
好像是的
That sounds right.

564
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,250
所以肯定出了什么问题
So there must be some kind of mistake.

565
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,530
你得去跟保险公司说啊
Well, you'll have to talk to the insurance company.

566
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,970
我去了  他们说保险被终止了
I did. They said it was terminated.

567
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,240
如果雇主不同意  他们就无法恢复
They can't reinstate it without the employer's approval.

568
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,140
你想让我帮你一把
And you want me to get involved?

569
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,440
有一些我需要的药物
There's medication that I need

570
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,030
必须通过健康维护组织获取
that I can't get unless it goes through my HMO.

571
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,770
这我知道  我看过你的档案
I'm well aware. I-- I reviewed your records.

572
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,880
-什么  -你签了同意书
- What? - You signed a consent form.

573
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,580
不  我...我没有
No. I-- I-- I didn't.

574
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,730
你伪造了我的签名吗
You forged my signature?

575
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,160
阿普博姆太太是不是去找过你
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?

576
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,760
你知道你这么做是...
You realize what you're doing is--

577
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,840
民事罪  不是刑事
Civil. Not criminal.

578
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,880
你想清楚了吗  因为等我们上了法庭
Have you thought this out? Because when we go to court--

579
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,340
六个月后吗
You mean six months from now? 

580
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,540
你还有四个月就生了  不是吗
You're expecting in four, no? 

581
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,530
那么你这四个月就没有药物可用
That's four months without the medicine you need. 

582
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,280
如果有必要的话  我宁愿让你的孩子
I'm wiling to let your child wither and die inside you 

583
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,790
夭折在你肚子里
if that's what's required.

584
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,870
但我们都不想看到那种结果
But neither of us wants that.

585
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,720
说说看  你真的想和我做敌人吗
Now tell me, am I really the sort of enemy you want to make? 

586
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,110
但你还有选择
But here's the alternative. 

587
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,120
这家机构  这些员工
This office, this staff, 

588
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,030
一年2200万美元都给你
22 million a year could be yours.

589
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,240
净水计划也是你的
The CWI could be yours. 

590
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,980
你我的恩怨一笔勾销
And you and me, we wash our hands of each other.

591
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,880
你想收买我
You're trying to buy me.

592
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,820
不  我们初见时我答应给你权力
No. When we first met, I promised to empower you.

593
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,550
我这是在兑现诺言
I'm fulfilling that promise.

594
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,500
你骗我怎么办
How do I get screwed?

595
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,340
不会的  我辞职  你取代我的职位
You don't. I resign. You take my place.

596
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,120
没其他条件吗
No strings?

597
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,230
没有
None.

598
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,220
民调显示吉姆·马修斯
Exit polls have Jim Matthews winning 

599
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,290
将以9到12个百分点的绝对优势赢得竞选
by anywhere from a nine-to-twelve-percent margin of victory.

600
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,260
喂
Hello?

601
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,510
安德伍德太太吗
Mrs. Underwood?

602
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,210
我是
Yes.

603
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,520
你好  这里是拉森医生办公室
Hi. I'm calling from Dr. Larson's office

604
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,470
跟您确认一下明早十点的血检和尿检
to confirm your 10 a.m. tomorrow for the blood and urine tests.

605
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,550
我去不了
I can't come.

606
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
如果明天不行
Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,

607
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,400
我们可以重新安排到周四  甚至周一
we can reschedule for Thursday or even Monday--

608
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,780
不  别给我安排了
No, I won't be rescheduling. 

609
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,950
请替我感谢拉森医生的会诊
Please tell Dr. Larson I appreciate all her consultation,

610
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,040
但我经过再三考虑
but I've put a great deal of thought into this 

611
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,670
我不会再进行其他检测了
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.

612
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,880
谢谢
Thank you.

613
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,470
你考虑过我们之前讨论的事了吗
Have you thought about what we discussed?

614
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,130
你说得没错  我们是该抛开过去  重新开始
I think you're right. We should start with a clean slate.

615
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,740
我们的短信呢
What about our text messages? 

616
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,740
{\an8}全部删除

617
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,130
还有通讯录
And the contact? 

618
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,110
{\an8}删除

619
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,480
我们之间没事吧
Are we good?

620
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,580
没事
Yeah.

621
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,100
我们忘记这些乱七八糟的事
And we can put all this other nonsense behind us 

622
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,000
互相信任  互相帮助  可以吗
and trust one another and continue to help one another?

623
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,360
这样很好
I'd like that.

624
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,410
那现在算是抛开过去了
Then consider the slate clean.

625
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,370
回答我个问题
Answer me one thing. 

626
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,360
副驾座的事
The passenger seat.

627
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,610
你说罗素是想出去
You said Russo was trying to get out. 

628
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,650
这没什么奇...
That there was nothing ab--

629
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,800
我们不是刚刚说好...
I thought we just agreed to--

630
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,220
我想相信你  但你得说明白
I want to believe you, but I need details.

631
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,670
你没说出来的信息
More than what you're sharing.

632
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,460
你想问什么
What's your question?

633
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,600
罗素酒瘾复发当晚  他出席了一个募捐活动
The night Russo fell off the wagon he was at a fundraiser. 

634
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,260
麦克奈利癌症研究所...
The McNeally Cancer Institute--

635
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,850
警察报告里全都有
All in the police report.

636
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,830
瑞秋·波斯纳当晚也在那家酒店
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.

637
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,710
那是谁
Who's that?

638
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,030
罗素被捕时跟他在一起的应召女
The call girl who was with Russo when he was arrested.

639
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,540
我又不知道她叫什么
I didn't know her name.

640
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,010
她消失了  弗兰西斯
She disappeared, Francis.

641
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,060
什么时候
When?

642
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,480
别装不知道  我给行李员看了张照片
Don't act surprised. I showed the bellmen a photo.

643
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,600
其中一个记得见过她
One of them remembers seeing her.

644
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,420
她是个妓女
The girl's a prostitute. 

645
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,670
她肯定经常出现在各种酒店
I'm sure she frequents many hotels.

646
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,620
可偏巧那晚去那家酒店吗
But that hotel on that night?

647
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,170
你这语气像斯克斯基小姐似的
Well, now you sound like Ms. Skorsky talking.

648
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,690
我没和任何人说过这事
I haven't discussed this with anyone. 

649
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,720
我想先问你
I wanted to ask you first.

650
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,850
我不知道那晚发生了什么
I have no idea what happened that night, 

651
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,950
只知道彼得又开始酗酒
except that Peter started drinking again.

652
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,970
我不知道有谁在场
I don't know who was or wasn't there. 

653
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,320
真希望我在
I wish I was. 

654
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,940
说不定我能阻止他
Maybe I could have stopped him.

655
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,020
你知道瑞秋在哪吗
Do you know where Rachel is?

656
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,700
相信我的话
Listen to what I am saying.

657
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,620
我是想要保护我们两个人
I am trying to protect us both.

658
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,330
谁都有可能问这些问题
These are questions anyone could ask.

659
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,530
但现在只有你在问
But no one is, except you.

660
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,320
我真不知你想干什么
I can't imagine what you're after.

661
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,960
我冒了个险
I took a chance.

662
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,690
跑去你家  任你摆布
Showed up at your house and placed myself at your feet.

663
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,280
于公于私都跨过了道德底线
Crossed ethical lines, professionally, physically.

664
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,630
我愿意为这些事情负责
And I hold myself accountable for that.

665
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,300
这都是我的选择  我愿意承担后果
Those were my choices, and I can live with them.

666
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,630
我也希望向前看
I'd like to move forward,

667
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,810
但我需要知道我到底卷入了什么事
but I need to know exactly what I was a part of.

668
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,340
我要确定我没有卷入...
That... that I wasn't a part of someone's...

669
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,060
把话说完
Finish your thought.

670
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,860
一起谋杀
Part of someone's murder.

671
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,840
天哪
Jesus.

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,000
我想要相信你  弗兰西斯

我知道你
I know you --

674
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,870
简宁

675
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,120
快进来
Come in.

676
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,080
我打不通你电话
I've been calling you.

677
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,350
进屋坐吧
Come in. Sit down. 

678
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,370
喝点什么吗
Um, you -- you want something?

679
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,460
水  或者果汁
Some, uh, water or, um, juice?

680
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,130
你要出门
You going somewhere?

681
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,720
你要去哪
Hey. You going somewhere?

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,360
去我妈妈那里  在伊萨卡
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

683
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,120
-什么  -我要走了
- What? - I'm leaving.

684
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,430
不不  不行
No. No, no, no. No. No way.

685
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,690
-我们什么都没有  -你要放弃吗
- We have nothing. - Are you giving up on this?

686
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,910
这世上只有三个人知道他干了什么
There are only three people in the world that know what he has done,

687
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,100
其中一个已经死了
and one of them is gone.

688
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,140
如果我们有证据  卢卡斯
If we had anything, Lucas,

689
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,220
任何确凿证据
any hard evidence

690
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,820
哪怕是一个愿意公开的信息源
or even a fucking quote from a source that would go on record for us,

691
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,920
那也好说
that would be one thing.

692
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,730
可我们纯粹在捕风捉影  而他不是闹着玩的
But we are grasping, and he is not fucking around.

693
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,140
是你说服佐伊追查这事的
You were the one who told Zoe to pursue this.

694
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,590
她告诉了我你说的话
She told me what you said.

695
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,350
能把你吓坏的文章才是真正重要的
The only stories that mattered were the ones that scared you to death.

696
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,420
这可不仅仅是死亡威胁
Okay, this isn't just death threats.

697
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,980
这是来真的
This is real.

698
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,960
他不知道你  但他知道我
He doesn't know about you, but he knows about me.

699
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,910
这是在我邮箱里发现的
These were in my mailbox.

700
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,290
没有发信地址
No return address.

701
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,960
他照了她的照片
He took these of her?

702
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,500
还能是谁  你留着吧
Who else? You can keep them.

703
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,700
但我不认为这对你有什么帮助
But I don't think they're gonna help you.

704
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,550
我们必须阻止他
We need to stop him.

705
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,890
变态混蛋
Sick fucking shit.

706
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,400
简宁  你不能就这么逃跑
Janine, you cannot run away from this!

707
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,110
我这一辈子从来都找硬骨头啃
My entire career, I have always chosen the tough stories.

708
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,980
我一向无所畏惧
I have been fearless. 

709
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,720
可你猜怎么着
But you know what?

710
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,860
我这回真的害怕极了
I'm really fucking scared this time.

711
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,260
他重权在握
He's got power.

712
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,710
他输不起
He's got a lot to lose.

713
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,990
现在他完全占了上风
And right now he is winning.

714
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,010
拜托  我需要你帮助  别这样
Please, I need your help. Please, don't do this.

715
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,080
别做梦了  卢卡斯
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!

716
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,710
事故发生于昨晚八点左右
The incident occurred at approximately eight p.m. last night

717
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,100
在大教堂高地地铁站北向的列车轨道上
on the northbound tracks of the Cathedral Heights metro station. 

718
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,760
华盛顿特区警察已经判定是一起意外
D.C. Police have ruled the death an accident.

719
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,040
佐伊·巴恩斯是头条网的资深撰稿人
Zoe Barnes was a senior contributor at slugline.com.

720
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,480
{\an8}佐伊·巴恩斯  地铁悲剧  新闻界对事故表示哀悼

721
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,170
此前她曾在《华盛顿先驱报》
Previously she worked at the Washington Herald

722
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,950
做都市新闻记者和政治记者
as a metro reporter and political correspondent.

723
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,310
巴恩斯报道过多条重要新闻
Barnes broke several major stories,

724
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,030
包括教育改革法案的草案
include an early draft of the Education Reform and Achievement Act,

725
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,100
以及导致迈克尔·科恩参议员
as well as a college newspaper article

726
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,550
未能被提名国务卿的
that derailed Senator Michael Kern's

727
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,190
一篇公报社论
nomination for Secretary of State...

728
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,880
你觉得那些文件怎么样
What'd you think of the files?

729
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,550
有不少可以下手的地方
There's plenty to work with.

730
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,690
你看了自己的吗
Did you look at your own?

731
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,260
里面什么都没有
There was nothing there.

732
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,820
里面该有什么吗
Should there be?

733
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,220
不应该
No.

734
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,370
即便你在撒谎
Even if you're lying, 

735
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,950
但我现在什么也没找到
the fact that I haven't been able to find anything 

736
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,410
这说明你很擅长隐藏踪迹
tells me you're very good at covering your tracks. 

737
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,570
这点对我来说很宝贵  这里就是我们的战场
That's, uh, valuable to me. Here's our battleground.

738
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,300
113票
113 votes.

739
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,460
看来你已经掌握大致情况了
You have the skeletons.

740
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,030
如果我失败了  他们不会放过我
If I lose, they'll come after me.

741
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,900
这是你必须承担的风险
That's a risk you have to take.

742
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,170
我怎么知道你不是在利用我
How do I know you're not just using me?

743
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,330
为别人竞选制造障碍
Throwing a wrench into someone else's bid?

744
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,300
那是另一种风险  你也可以选择等上十年
That's another risk. The alternative is you wait 10 years.

745
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,610
你选我肯定是有原因的
You chose me for a reason. 

746
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,480
我想知道是什么
I'd like to know what it is.

747
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,610
好吧
All right. 

748
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,700
你发起过多少次导弹攻击
How many missile strikes did you launch?

749
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,410
多到让我整夜不能安睡
Enough to keep me awake at night.

750
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,610
但你还是那么做了
But you did it anyway.

751
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,590
是的  没错
Yes, I did.

752
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,990
会伤及多少妇女儿童
How many women and children?

753
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,920
太多了
Too many.

754
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,300
就算知道会伤及无辜
And you launched those missiles 

755
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,200
你还是义无反顾地发射了导弹
knowing all those innocent people would die.

756
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,310
我是奉命歼灭敌人
I had orders to eliminate the enemy.

757
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,030
而你专业高效地完成了任务
Which you carried out expertly and efficiently.

758
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,510
你杀过人吗
Have you ever killed anyone?

759
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,250
没有
No.

760
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,910
我曾亲眼目睹整栋大楼  整个村庄荡然无存
I watched apartment buildings, entire villages gone,

761
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,540
就像不曾存在过
like they were never there. 

762
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,980
如果可以  我不想再谈这个话题了
I'd prefer not to talk about it, if that's all right.

763
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,090
你完成需要完成的任务
You did what needed to be done, 

764
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,450
这就是我选择你的原因  杰姬
and that's why I chose you, Jackie. 

765
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,630
服役背景  历史清白
Service background. Clean history.

766
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,950
上相  我全都看好
Photogenic. The whole package. 

767
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,830
但更重要的是
But more importantly, 

768
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,710
坚决  务实
ruthless pragmatism.

769
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,540
我们能合作吗
Are we working together or not?

770
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,400
有公开或私下表示支持巴克沃特吗
Any public or private endorsements for Buchwalter, 

771
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,340
我支持韦伯
I come out for Webb.

772
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,500
我不参与争论  我向你保证
I'll stay out of the fray. I give you my word.

773
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,750
你也一样  泰瑞
Same goes for you, Terry.

774
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,930
谢谢  克里斯蒂娜
Thank you, Christina.

775
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:38,860
先生们
Gentlemen.

776
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,630
总统先生  宾州情况怎么样
Mr. President. How was Pennsylvania?

777
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,380
喜欢印度菜吗
You like Indian?

778
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,630
先生  我看到新闻了
Sir? I've seen the news. 

779
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,510
我知道她跟您很亲近
I know she was close to you.

780
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,120
可怕的悲剧啊
Terrible tragedy.

781
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,280
今天特别探员洛克兰来找过我  先生

782
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,340

783
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,250
很好
Very good.

784
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,210
我知道已经晚了一天
I know it's a day late. 

785
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,790
但愿这样不失妥当
Hope it isn't inappropriate,

786
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,930
我想给您这个
but I wanted to give you this.

787
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,430
谢谢  密查姆
Thank you, Meechum.

788
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,290
艾德华真是太贴心了
That was very nice of Edward.

789
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,570
他不该为我花这种钱
He shouldn't have spent this sorta money on me.

790
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,960
我在楼下开了酒
I've opened some wine downstairs.

791
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,270
我就下去
I'll be down in a minute. 

792
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,980
你以为我把你忘了吗
Did you think I'd forgotten you? 

793
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,100
也许你希望我已经忘了
Perhaps you hoped I had. 

794
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,130
别浪费时间哀悼巴恩斯小姐了
Don't waste a breath mourning Ms. Barnes. 

795
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,430
每只小猫都会长大
Every kitten grows up to be a cat. 

796
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,460
一开始看起来都很无害
They seem so harmless at first. 

797
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,840
幼小  安静  舔着浅盘里的牛奶
Small, quiet, lapping up their saucer of milk.

798
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,670
但爪子一旦长长了  猫就会挠人
But once their claws get long enough, they draw blood. 

799
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,340
有时甚至会挠养猫人的手
Sometimes from the hand that feeds them. 

800
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,700
对于我们这些爬向食物链顶端的人来说
For those of us climbing to the top of the food chain, 

801
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,530
决不能心慈手软
there can be no mercy. 

802
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,920
只有一条规则  不做猎人  便为猎物
There is but one rule: hunt or be hunted. 

803
