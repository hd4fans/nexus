1
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,581
- Mr. Mills, how are you? - I'm fine.

2
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:46,791
- How are you? - Fine.

3
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:49,544
- I suppose you wanna see it again? - Lf you don't mind.

4
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,254
- You know where it is. - Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:55,841
If I charged you a dollar every time you came to examine the machine...

6
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:59,011
...you'd probably own it. It's the one all the pros use.

7
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:01,681
Mariah Carey. Beyonce. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,058
Really? Who's Beyonce?

9
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,769
Just kidding. I'll take it.

10
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,383
Excuse me, sir. The adult party's in the front.

11
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,053
- I'm Kim's father. - Excuse me, I work for her father.

12
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,348
- Her real father. - It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

13
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,601
- Hello, Bryan. - Lenore.

14
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,521
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,565
We're letting the kids have their space.

16
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:55,693
- Put it with the others. - I wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,029
- Still having trouble following the rules. - Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:02,241
- I've asked you not to call me that. - Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,868
- Dad! - Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,703
- Hi. - Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:08,330
- Happy birthday. - I was telling your father...

22
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,083
...how we arranged the presents. - Here.

23
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,043
It's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,087
...and not the others. - Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,717
- Cool. - A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:23,178
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer. - When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,806
- We've moved on. - Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,600
My pleasure.

29
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,853
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom. - You got it.

30
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,772
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,775
- We have a professional photographer. - Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,360
That's my girl.

33
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,370
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:50,289
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

35
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,749
Oh, my... Stuart!

36
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,460
Stuart, I love you! I love you! I love you!

37
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,462
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,101
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible. - I know.

39
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,895
- Hey, Bryan. - Stuart.

40
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,732
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh? - I guess not.

41
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,152
- Will you join us for lunch? - No, thanks.

42
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,280
I just wanted to be here to wish her a happy birthday.

43
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,492
- Good to see you, Bryan. - You too.

44
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:42,382
Thanks.

45
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,212
- Hey. - Hey.

46
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,048
You forgot.

47
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,009
Come on in.

48
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,471
It's not like I didn't call to remind you. Third Saturday in May?

49
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:32,141
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar? - He probably had a lot on his mind.

50
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,394
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree. Every day a new adventure.

51
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:39,023
What does a retiree do, anyway? Take naps? Play golf?

52
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,692
- Hit on rich widows? - That takes care of the morning.

53
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,361
Yeah, well, come on, guys. You know why I'm here.

54
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,071
Yeah, how's that going?

55
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,073
Okay. We had her birthday today.

56
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,784
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

57
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,745
Seventeen?

58
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,457
- To Kim. - Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

59
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,585
She's not Lennie anymore. She's Lenore.

60
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,378
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

61
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,964
- And the husband? - The same. Perfect.

62
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,760
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit. - We can dig if you want us to dig.

63
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:10,179
What, you think he hasn't done it already?

64
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:11,597
Thank you, Bernie.

65
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,642
- How's Kimmy? - Good. She's good.

66
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,936
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

67
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,605
Well, let's say we're working on it.

68
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,358
She appreciate the fact that you've given up your life...

69
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:25,903
...in order to be closer to her?

70
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,113
What a life, huh?

71
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:31,241
Hey, remember Beirut after the chief disappeared?

72
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,953
Bry was in deep with that crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

73
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,456
The guy said he'd get us inside then disappeared.

74
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,541
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

75
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,918
...before we get taken down and where are you?

76
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,962
I promised never to miss her birthday.

77
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,214
Yeah, that went down well at Langley...

78
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,467
...when they found out you flew the coop...

79
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,470
...to attend your child's birthday 9000 miles away.

80
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,555
Where did you say your next posting was?

81
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:55,475
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins, I believe it was.

82
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,309
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

83
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:59,937
Actually, it was Alaska. What's your point, Sam?

84
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:04,525
My point is we have an open space. Say the word, it's yours.

85
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,237
Who likes theirs rare?

86
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,114
- Guys. - See you, Bryan.

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,492
- Good night, guys. - See you, Bry.

88
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,785
Hey, look, look, look. All kidding aside...

89
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:18,080
...it's a great thing trying to make up for lost time with Kimmy.

90
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,124
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

91
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,917
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

92
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:25,087
...just for taking some pop diva to and from her concert.

93
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,756
- We're one short. - A singer?

94
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,967
I don't know if you'd call her a singer. More like a cash cow.

95
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,053
Twenty million records sold already and she's not even 25.

96
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,472
Job's a piece of cake.

97
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,808
We get her there and back. Inside, they've got their own people.

98
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,102
- Okay. - Okay. Okay?

99
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:41,353
- Yeah. - Like that's it?

100
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:42,688
Yeah.

101
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:46,651
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times. - Better. No one gets killed.

102
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,279
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys. - See you.

103
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:53,783
- Get in the back, Wendy. - I always get in the back.

104
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,729
Ma'am, if you don't mind, I suggest you keep moving.

105
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,981
My mother is ma'am, if you don't mind.

106
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:32,321
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go. - Okay.

107
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:36,576
Bernie, Casey, you're out here. Bry, you're in the room.

108
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:38,327
Okay.

109
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:42,164
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

110
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,166
Thank you for coming.

111
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,224
Wow, it was beautiful.

112
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,393
Thanks. What did you say your name was again?

113
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,104
Mills. Bryan Mills.

114
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,982
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills. - You too.

115
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,069
- You're on. Come on, let's go now. - Okay, guys.

116
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:13,278
Excuse me, miss.

117
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:17,908
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer and was wondering if you had any tips.

118
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,703
Yeah, I do.

119
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,038
Tell her to pick another career.

120
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,210
I got one. We're waiting on an air strike...

121
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:31,255
...and we're waiting and then my satellite phone rings.

122
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,465
- Who is it? - Hello?

123
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,424
- The guy we're to terminate. - Honey.

124
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:37,637
- He'd like to know if we want some tea. - Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

125
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,140
The noise?

126
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,433
I'm at a concert.

127
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,646
You know this song? Yeah?

128
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,982
Yep, that's her. No, no, no, I'm not attending.

129
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,609
I'm... I'm not attending.

130
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:54,403
I'm helping some friends out with security.

131
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,614
Well, of course I met her.

132
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,448
Who do you think's guarding her?

133
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:00,785
I'm glad you're impressed.

134
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:03,162
Hey, I'm happy you called.

135
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,624
I'm happy you called. What?

136
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,126
Lunch? Tomorrow?

137
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,922
Sure, sure. I know the place.

138
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:15,340
Twelve-thirty it is.

139
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,468
I'll see you then.

140
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,845
- Here he is. And? - What happened?

141
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,847
- She wants to have lunch. - Okay.

142
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,183
- Just the two of us. - All right. Fantastic.

143
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,143
See? There's progress. That's great.

144
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:43,035
Who left that gate open? Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

145
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,328
- Move! - Go, go!

146
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,040
More security here now!

147
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,875
That's it. Move.

148
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,383
Casey!

149
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:02,179
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

150
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,389
- Go, go, go. - Watch your head.

151
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:11,981
Here, take this. The sugar will take the edge off the shock.

152
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:14,399
Come on, come on, drink some more.

153
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,410
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

154
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,918
You're safe now.

155
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:36,589
Bernie.

156
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,716
Casey. Rambo.

157
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:42,261
Seriously, Bry, you should think about coming with us.

158
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:45,014
You've got the edge. There's more of this to be had.

159
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,099
- She's going to college next year? - Yep.

160
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,352
- You're gonna lose her. - That gives me a year to find her.

161
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,939
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

162
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:02,031
- How are you feeling? - Better.

163
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,619
So your daughter wants to be a singer?

164
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,914
Yep, since she was 5.

165
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,874
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

166
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:17,254
Once the glam wears off, it's just a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

167
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:18,923
It's what she wants.

168
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,137
The first number is Gio, my vocal coach.

169
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,306
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

170
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:30,059
He'll give her coaching she needs, the fee is on me.

171
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,186
The second number is my manager.

172
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,939
If Gio clears her, he'll make sure she gets a shot.

173
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,236
- Thank you. - No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

174
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,755
- There she is. - Dad.

175
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,719
- Hi, sweetie. - Hey.

176
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,137
- Hi. - Hi.

177
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,723
Don't look so excited.

178
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,309
I was just surprised. I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

179
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,103
I asked Mom to come.

180
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:19,859
One raspberry-banana milkshake, extra cherries, just the way you like it.

181
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,486
- Thanks. - Lennie... Lenore.

182
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:24,363
- Would you like something? - I'm fine, thanks.

183
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,365
So?

184
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:28,408
So, Dad, guess what.

185
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,202
- You know my friend Amanda? - Yep.

186
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:34,039
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation with them in Paris.

187
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,290
How cool is that?

188
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,002
- Why do you want to go to Paris? - Dad. Hello?

189
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:41,464
The Louvre, the lmpressionist museum, the Picasso Museum.

190
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:43,508
I didn't know you were so into art.

191
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,719
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA, like, a hundred times.

192
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:51,641
Amanda went last summer, she came back, she could practically speak French.

193
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,520
And because you're under 18...

194
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,523
...you need my permission to leave the country?

195
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,527
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

196
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:05,530
They've got this sick apartment overlooking the river.

197
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,157
- Just you and Amanda? - And her cousins.

198
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:11,577
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan. Just sign the paper.

199
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,043
- What? - I'm not comfortable with this.

200
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,920
- Dad. - I know the world, sweetie.

201
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:24,256
- Dad, please. - A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

202
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,676
- I'm not gonna be alone. - Two 17-year-olds.

203
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,844
Amanda's 19.

204
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,936
How about this? How about if I go along?

205
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,939
You won't know I'm there. I'm very good at being invisible.

206
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,442
As you so amply demonstrated for most of her life.

207
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,194
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

208
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,615
I'll think about it.

209
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,951
Everyone at this table knows what that means.

210
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,412
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

211
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:58,708
- I don't want anything else. - Kim.

212
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,632
- I don't get you. - What?

213
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,135
You sacrificed our marriage in the service of the country.

214
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:13,055
You made a mess of your life in service of your country.

215
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:16,058
Can't you sacrifice a little this time for your daughter?

216
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:19,103
- I would sacrifice anything for her. - What's your problem?

217
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,565
I'm not comfortable putting my daughter at risk.

218
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,736
Putting our daughter at risk by going to Paris?

219
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,154
You're pathetic.

220
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:47,381
- She's coming. - Thanks.

221
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:51,677
Three conditions.

222
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,680
The address and phone number of where you're staying.

223
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:57,808
You move, I wanna know where and with whom you'll be staying.

224
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:01,521
Call me when you land. Call me every night before you go to sleep.

225
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,481
It's international. My number is in.

226
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,775
- Okay, awesome. - Kimmy, you're not focused.

227
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,192
- I am. - What did I say?

228
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,696
You said call you when I land, every night before I go to sleep...

229
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,699
...your phone's international, the number's programmed in.

230
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:17,036
Okay, one last thing. I get to take you to the airport.

231
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,704
Okay.

232
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,499
- There you go. - Yes.

233
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,002
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:26,879
Mom!

235
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:29,965
I love you, Dad.

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,178
Mom, he signed it, he signed it. I'm gonna go call Amanda!

237
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:40,685
Wouldn't it have been easier to sign the first time?

238
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:44,480
Wouldn't it have been easier if you and I had talked about it first?

239
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:51,654
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid. I've written them down.

240
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,072
- Dad. - Come on, take it.

241
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:57,034
We're gonna be spending 90 percent of our time in museums. Don't worry.

242
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:59,912
That's like telling water not to be wet, sweetie.

243
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,081
Mom says your job made you paranoid.

244
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,999
Well, my job made me aware.

245
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:09,213
I used to ask Mom what your job was that you were away all the time.

246
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,716
And she would tell me to ask you.

247
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:15,511
Whenever I did see you, I was afraid to ask.

248
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,429
Yeah? Why?

249
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,100
I don't know. Maybe because...

250
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:23,936
...I was afraid to find out.

251
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,940
Like, maybe it was something I wouldn't like.

252
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:31,443
I worked for the government. You knew that.

253
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:36,198
So you were like a spy, right?

254
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,827
- What happens if I push this button? - Don't touch that button.

255
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:45,875
Well, no, I was a... I was a preventer, actually.

256
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,877
- A preventer? - Yeah.

257
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:50,212
What did you prevent?

258
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,381
Bad things from happening.

259
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,969
So it was a good job?

260
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,930
Yes. Yep, it was.

261
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,893
Do you miss it?

262
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,728
I missed you more.

263
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,120
- Kim! - Dad, there's Amanda.

264
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,122
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

265
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,522
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those. - I can manage.

266
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,148
Lenore.

267
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,151
Do you know about this? She's not just going to Paris.

268
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:56,487
- I know. - She lied to me.

269
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:58,823
Yes, because she can't be honest with you.

270
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,033
Why? What are you talking about?

271
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,868
Your rules and conditions.

272
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,369
What is this?

273
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:07,289
It's U2's European tour dates.

274
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,459
She's following a rock band around Europe?

275
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,337
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets, arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

276
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:16,674
Best hotels. You know, you live in your little bubble here...

277
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:20,219
...behind your wall, with your maids and chauffeurs and servants.

278
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,846
No idea what the world is like.

279
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:25,850
Yes, and neither will she unless she goes out and experiences it.

280
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,979
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

281
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:34,108
For five years I waited for a phone call that didn't come for weeks at a time.

282
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,319
For a knock on the door telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

283
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:45,536
Listen, I know you moved here to build some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

284
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:48,539
But you're not gonna do that by smothering her.

285
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:52,251
Let her live, or I promise, I promise you'll lose her.

286
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,259
Girls.

287
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,099
Kim!

288
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:14,106
I love you.

289
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,277
Let's go. Come on.

290
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,249
I'll teach you the French words I know.

291
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,960
- Which may not be that much, but... - Okay. Yeah, right.

292
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,967
Three. Okay, now take one...

293
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,136
Need some help? One with the two of you?

294
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,639
Yes, please.

295
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:48,808
- Okay. - He's really cute.

296
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,769
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

297
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:52,978
Where are you from?

298
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,189
California.

299
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,154
No. I'm Peter.

300
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:09,829
- This is Kim. - Hi.

301
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:11,163
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.

302
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,790
Hey.

303
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:15,417
You're going into Paris?

304
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,546
You know, taxis here are so damned expensive.

305
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:19,839
Want to share?

306
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,841
- Yeah. Sure. - Okay, perfect.

307
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,843
Thanks.

308
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,973
To check arrivals, please press one.

309
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,642
Please enter the flight number.

310
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:37,189
Flight 288 arrived in Paris Charles de Gaulle...

311
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,860
...at 8 a.m. Local time.

312
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:43,529
Yeah.

313
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,156
Oh, are you serious?

314
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,659
- Oh, my God. - Nice address.

315
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,202
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,499
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid, so we have the whole place to ourselves.

317
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:56,208
How cool is that?

318
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,044
- I didn't know that. - It's no biggie.

319
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,213
Well, I have to be going.

320
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,132
- Nice to meet you. - Oh, okay.

321
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:04,383
- You too. - Bye.

322
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,552
Hey.

323
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,139
There is a party tonight at school. Want to come?

324
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,057
- Sure. Yeah. - We don't even know him.

325
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,393
What is there to know? He's hot.

326
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,729
- I come pick you up around 9? - Okay, yeah.

327
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,898
Okay, great. Your apartment?

328
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:22,693
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann. - Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

329
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,487
Bye.

330
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:33,996
Yeah.

331
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:35,998
Fifth floor.

332
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,834
Two girls around 18.

333
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:43,213
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,509
- How sick is this? - Are you kidding me? It's great.

335
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:49,554
I just wish you would've told me they weren't gonna be here.

336
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,389
- What's the difference? - I told my dad they'd be here.

337
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,850
You told your dad you were going to museums too.

338
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,852
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

339
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:59,855
- I'm gonna sleep with him. - Who?

340
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:01,524
- Peter. - You just met him.

341
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,069
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

342
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,613
- Maybe he has a friend, huh? - No.

343
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,948
- No. - Oh, come on.

344
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:12,952
You gotta lose it sometime. Might as well be in Paris.

345
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:18,624
Hey!

346
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,605
- Amanda, where's the bathroom? - What?

347
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:41,856
I have to pee!

348
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:10,092
- Hello? - It's me. Has Kim called you?

349
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:15,097
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris. Give her some space.

350
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:17,517
She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.

351
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,852
Have a drink or something. Good night.

352
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,647
Good night.

353
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:39,830
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,542
Kim.

355
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,671
What did I say? You were supposed to call me.

356
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:50,299
I thought something was wrong with the phone.

358
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,177
- No. It was such a rush at the airport. - All right.

359
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:56,013
Well, if I'd had the number where you were staying...

360
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,848
...I would've just called there.

361
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:59,058
What's the number?

362
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,852
- I don't have it. - Kimmy, come on.

363
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:04,814
This is one of the conditions. Let me talk to the cousins.

364
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,649
I'll get it from them.

365
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,486
Dad, they're in Spain. I didn't know. I swear.

366
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:12,738
To Spain?

367
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,452
Kim, is there anything else you want to tell me?

368
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,748
Kimmy.

369
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,714
- There's someone here. - The cousins are back?

370
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,591
No.

371
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,844
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda. - What?

372
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:37,597
What are you talking about? Kimmy?

373
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,014
- Dad. - Kim.

374
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,935
- Kim. - Dad. They took her.

375
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:45,395
- They took her. - All right, listen to me.

376
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:47,022
Oh, God.

377
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:49,775
- Did you meet anyone on the plane? - No.

378
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:53,028
- In the airport? - No. Yes, Peter.

379
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:54,864
- Peter? Peter who? - I don't know.

380
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,198
- An American? - No.

381
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:58,408
Did he know where you were staying?

382
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:00,077
He took a cab with us.

383
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,750
Dad, they're coming.

384
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,961
- Please, I'm scared. - I know you are.

385
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:11,464
Stay focused, Kimmy. You have to hold it together.

386
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,215
How many people are there?

387
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:15,885
- Three, four. I don't know. - Where are you?

388
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,972
- I'm in the bathroom. - Go to the next bedroom.

389
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,808
Get under the bed. Tell me when you're there.

390
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:34,654
- I'm here. - Now, the next part is very important.

391
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,827
They are going to take you. Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

392
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:45,498
You will have five, maybe ten seconds. Very important seconds.

393
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,167
Leave the phone on the floor. Concentrate.

394
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,421
Shout out everything you see about them. Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

395
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,965
Anything you see. You understand?

396
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,345
They're there. I can hear them.

397
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,347
Remember, concentrate.

398
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,279
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

399
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:45,558
They're leaving. I think they're...

400
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:54,358
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

401
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,507
I don't know who you are.

402
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:20,926
I don't know what you want.

403
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:25,055
If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have money.

404
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:29,644
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills.

405
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,605
Skills I've acquired over a very long career.

406
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:36,651
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

407
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:40,571
If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.

408
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:44,617
I will not look for you. I will not pursue you.

409
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:48,579
But if you don't, I will look for you.

410
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,457
I will find you...

411
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,959
...and I will kill you.

412
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,799
Good luck.

413
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,145
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

414
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:17,441
I'm gonna download something. I need it analyzed. Right now.

415
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,819
- She's been taken. - What?

416
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:22,321
- Any enemies overseas? - Why would I have enemies?

417
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,407
You do business overseas through multiple shell corporations.

418
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:29,161
You were involved in an oil deal with a bunch of Russians that went south.

419
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,164
- How do you know that? - I was not gonna let my daughter...

420
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:35,167
...live with someone without knowing everything about them.

421
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:38,504
- I have a few resources... - Now is not the time for dick measuring.

422
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:40,840
- Anyone looking to hurt you? - Not that I know.

423
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,967
- Which room's Kim's? - What happened?

424
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:46,637
I got a call from her. There were people in the apartment. She was taken.

425
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,180
- Oh, God. - Which one?

426
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,974
That one.

427
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,980
Is there something I should be doing?

428
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:59,066
You have a lease agreement with NetJet through your company.

429
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,776
I do.

430
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,153
- Get me a plane to Paris. - For when?

431
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,446
An hour ago.

432
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:08,033
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

433
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:20,170
Would you please get her back to me, Bryan?

434
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,047
First I have to find her.

435
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,971
Sam, what have you got?

436
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:30,389
They're speaking Albanian.

437
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,976
Based on their accents and dialects, they must be from Tropoja.

438
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,978
The place is ground zero for scummers.

439
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,397
Even the Russians give these guys a wide berth.

440
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:41,358
The one you spoke to, his name is Marko.

441
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,528
We have information that a mobster boss...

442
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:46,906
...by the name of Marko Hoxha moved to Paris about six months ago.

443
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:52,828
If he's the one, he's a big fish. The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.

444
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,915
- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself? - Lenore is here.

445
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:59,334
- Hey, Lennie. - Hello, Sam.

446
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:00,920
She needs to hear it, Sam.

447
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:05,883
The specialty of the groups coming out of this area is trafficking in women.

448
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,681
- Keep going. - Okay.

449
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:16,602
Their previous m.o. Was to offer women from emerging East European countries...

450
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:20,856
...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, jobs in the West as maids and nannies.

451
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:25,486
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

452
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:29,865
Lately, however, they've decided that it's more economical...

453
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:34,912
...just to kidnap traveling young women. Saves on transportation costs.

454
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,457
Oh, my little baby.

455
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,208
What else?

456
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:42,462
Based on the way these groups operate, our analyst says...

457
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,465
...you have a 96-hour window from the time she was grabbed.

458
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:48,133
- To what? - To never finding her.

459
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,386
No, no, no.

460
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,222
Daddy!

461
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:57,643
Mustache. Six feet. Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.

462
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,479
Da...

463
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,278
Good luck.

464
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:12,908
Good luck.

465
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:16,120
Good luck.

466
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:18,998
Good luck.

467
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,682
Oh, my God.

468
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,603
Dad, they got Amanda.

469
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,740
Oh, God.

470
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,785
Dad, they got her.

471
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:23,789
They took her.

472
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,250
Go to the next bedroom. Get under the bed.

473
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,795
- Tell me when you're there. - I'm here.

474
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:38,721
Stay focused, baby. Leave the phone on the floor.

475
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,390
Concentrate. Shout out everything you see about them.

476
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:45,435
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars. Anything you see. You understand?

477
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,564
They're there. I can hear them. Remember, concentrate.

478
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,664
They're leaving. Daddy!

479
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,834
Dad!

480
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:13,255
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

481
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:15,049
Dad!

482
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:57,943
- Hi. - Hi.

483
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,779
- I'm Peter. - I'm Ingrid.

484
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:01,238
- On holidays? - Yes.

485
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:03,115
- Me too. - Cool.

486
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:05,743
Cabs here are so damned expensive. Want to share?

487
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,245
- Sure. Why not? - Great.

488
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,458
- Excuse me. - Hey.

489
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,295
- Hey. - Drive.

490
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,592
- The two American girls from yesterday? - I don't know.

491
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:26,388
The next rib drives into your lungs. The two American girls, where are they?

492
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:31,180
- Just like the old days. - Would you have it any other way?

493
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:32,765
Between you and me? No.

494
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,268
But now that I sit behind a desk, the world looks different.

495
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,771
- You mean, looks boring. - I mean different.

496
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:43,275
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired any more interesting?

497
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,862
It wasn't. Until my daughter disappeared in Paris yesterday.

498
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:50,950
She and her friend were marked by a spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

499
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:53,453
- How do you know this? - I'm retired, not dead.

500
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:56,371
And I assume you don't want to go to the police.

501
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:59,291
I was told I have 96 hours. That was 16 hours ago.

502
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,420
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter. - I found him, he's dead.

503
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,217
You found him that way?

504
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:14,264
Bryan, you cannot just run around tearing down Paris...

505
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:16,601
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to.

506
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,436
- Don't forget who you talk to. - I'm talking to a friend.

507
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:24,650
You are. But please remember, your friend has a desk now.

508
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,320
"Deputy director, Internal Security." Very impressive.

509
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,490
The Albanians?

510
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,576
They showed up from the East, six, seven years ago.

511
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,120
Fifteen, 20 of them. Now there are hundreds.

512
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:38,998
We don't even know how many. And dangerous.

513
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,876
So I heard. Where do I find them?

514
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:48,340
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy. Bryan, try not to make a mess.

515
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:54,239
- Gregor Milocivic? - Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

516
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:56,742
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

517
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:02,873
Here is my resume.

518
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,835
The employment agency said we would be doing translations.

519
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,921
Yes. Albanian to English. You do speak Albanian?

520
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:12,257
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian. I was a teacher in primary school...

521
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:15,177
...before the war began in Pristina... - What's your rate?

522
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:16,596
My rate?

523
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,932
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours and then it goes up...

524
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,936
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours. Wait here.

525
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:28,566
Mr. Smith, I do not understand. What is the job exactly?

526
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:31,068
Right now the job is to wait here.

527
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:40,536
Good evening.

528
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:44,749
- Hi. Looking for a date? - I love your dress. Is that silk?

529
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,126
I don't know. You want to know the prices?

530
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,211
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

531
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:52,715
How it compliments the natural curves of your body.

532
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:54,967
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

533
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,927
Standard? Could you be more specific?

534
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,764
Back home, the standard covers a range of possibilities.

535
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,307
Like kissing, you know, closed lips, open lips.

536
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:05,435
- Lf you're not buying, piss off. - I didn't say I wasn't buying.

537
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:07,772
I like to get comfortable before I purchase.

538
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,815
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

539
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:13,653
I must have read that manual from cover to cover so many times.

540
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:17,281
I don't give a shit. You're gonna get me in trouble if you don't buy.

541
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,659
- Trouble? Really? With who? - Piss off.

542
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:22,495
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

543
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:25,915
If I want a package deal, do I get a discount?

544
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:29,794
- You cost me two now. - My name's Bryan.

545
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:33,673
- Oh, God. You better leave. - I thought we were negotiating.

546
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:36,425
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

547
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:39,428
- I told him... - Why are you bothering the girl?

548
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:41,931
- None of your business. - She is my business.

549
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,684
And if you're not spending money, you're costing money.

550
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,687
- I was negotiating. - No negotiating. Price is the price.

551
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:49,772
Now you owe me for two that got away.

552
00:43:49,939 --> 00:43:52,149
I don't owe you nothing.

553
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:56,862
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass. - Sure, sure, okay.

554
00:43:57,029 --> 00:43:58,781
Chill.

555
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:04,704
Okay. Here's your 50.

556
00:44:05,455 --> 00:44:09,500
And another 50 for being an asshole. Now get the hell out of here.

557
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:12,377
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

558
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:22,137
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

559
00:44:22,304 --> 00:44:25,224
- You are to translate. - Yes. But translate what?

560
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:27,309
This.

561
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,026
Translate.

562
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:39,655
- They're talking about you. - What about me?

563
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:42,492
- They're not saying nice things. - Be specific.

564
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:46,120
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith. - What an asshole you are.

565
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:50,374
Please, if you can explain to me why we're doing this...

566
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:52,209
Just translate.

567
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:55,212
One of them says, the sausage gave him heartburn.

568
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:56,589
Keep going.

569
00:44:56,756 --> 00:45:01,218
The other one is suggesting something his grandmother used to give him.

570
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:04,847
- Do you really want to hear all this? - Every word.

571
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:10,060
Now they're talking about football. The game between Lazio and Marseille.

572
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:12,104
And they lost money on the betting.

573
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:16,859
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose... - You're better off not knowing.

574
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:19,278
Is it still football?

575
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,446
One is on the phone.

576
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,908
He has to do a job at the construction site.

577
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:27,077
Something about fresh merchandise giving problems.

578
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,622
Mr. Smith, I do not understand any of this.

579
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,750
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

580
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:37,797
I asked for an English-Albanian dictionary, did you bring one?

581
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,258
Thank you.

582
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:20,525
I love you.

583
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:38,292
Where did you get this?

584
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,545
Where did you get this?

585
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:43,714
- I'm good. - Who gave this to you?

586
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:48,093
- Who...? Who gave this to you? - I'm good.

587
00:47:50,638 --> 00:47:52,181
Hey.

588
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,790
Hey.

589
00:48:32,304 --> 00:48:33,931
Come on.

590
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:16,361
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

591
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:18,363
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

592
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,115
Well, still in charge.

593
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:23,035
- Been a long time since I've seen you. - Way too long.

594
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:25,663
- The usual accommodation? - Plus one.

595
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:13,479
Yes?

596
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:16,231
- We need to talk. - I'm listening.

597
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:20,402
Well, can't you come and meet me first?

598
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,196
I can't see you. Where are you?

599
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:25,157
I can see you and hear you very well.

600
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:28,327
You can tell them to stop jogging now.

601
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:38,796
Didn't think I was gonna come down, did you?

602
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:41,256
I didn't think you were gonna make such a mess.

603
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:43,468
I didn't have time to worry about neatness.

604
00:54:43,634 --> 00:54:46,762
- I know. You have 70 hours. - Now I have 56.

605
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:50,140
No, now you have none.

606
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:53,519
My chief wanted to arrest you, I convinced him to send you home.

607
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:59,191
Air France 001 leaves today at 2. First class.

608
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,319
Courtesy of the French government for past services rendered.

609
00:55:05,656 --> 00:55:09,118
- And what about my daughter? - I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

610
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:12,663
I take my orders from someone who sits behind a bigger desk.

611
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,501
Come on, seven dead bodies, three in hospital, a building destroyed.

612
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:18,002
Total chaos at the airport.

613
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:21,506
He wanted your ass in chains. It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

614
00:55:21,672 --> 00:55:24,299
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude. Not this time.

615
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,389
You can't beat the state, Bryan. You know that.

616
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:33,017
I'm not trying to. I'm trying to save my daughter.

617
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:34,894
It was a trailer, not a building.

618
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:16,727
No, no, no. Leave it.

619
00:56:17,603 --> 00:56:19,354
It's all right, it's fluids.

620
00:56:19,564 --> 00:56:21,524
And medication to counteract the drugs.

621
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:23,609
It's all right.

622
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:27,738
Where'd you get this?

623
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:30,700
Where did you get this jacket?

624
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:33,077
Did you get it from her?

625
00:56:33,744 --> 00:56:35,705
Was it from this girl?

626
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,709
I didn't steal it.

627
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,546
- I was cold, she gave it to me. - Where? Where did she give it to you?

628
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:47,717
- In the house. - What house?

629
00:56:48,884 --> 00:56:50,553
The house with the red door.

630
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:54,890
Sorry.

631
00:56:59,937 --> 00:57:03,148
He said it was a party.

632
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:06,611
The girl who gave you this, was she in the house?

633
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:13,451
She was nice.

634
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:15,119
I know.

635
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,580
She's my daughter.

636
00:57:22,752 --> 00:57:25,463
I need to find this house. Do you know where it is?

637
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:33,303
Paradise.

638
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,113
- Good morning. - May I help you?

639
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,407
- I'm here to see your boss. - No boss.

640
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:01,040
We're doing nothing wrong here.

641
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,376
One button, and 30 agents will be here...

642
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:06,837
...before you have time to scratch your balls.

643
00:58:07,046 --> 00:58:10,299
Stop jerking around before I close you down for wasting my time.

644
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:17,515
Wait here.

645
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,320
You have weapon?

646
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:32,947
You're holding it.

647
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,018
Black, one sugar, please.

648
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,360
What is it you want?

649
00:59:12,903 --> 00:59:14,530
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

650
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:17,908
We already negotiated the rate with Mr. Macon.

651
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:21,245
Mr. Macon has moved to another division.

652
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:23,247
I'm here for the renegotiation.

653
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:30,713
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable, let me explain ourselves.

654
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:35,760
Nice coffee. We have you under satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

655
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:39,597
We hear everything you say, we know everything you do.

656
00:59:39,764 --> 00:59:43,100
Do you have any idea what it costs just to change the angle...

657
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:46,729
...of the lens on a satellite orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

658
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:48,481
And those costs have gone up.

659
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:51,901
Our costs go up, your costs go up. It's only logical.

660
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:55,154
By the way, which one of you is Marko?

661
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,114
Why do you want to know?

662
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:58,824
I was told Marko is in charge.

663
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,785
We are all Marko.

664
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:03,412
Marko from Tropoja.

665
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:04,830
We are all from Tropoja.

666
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:10,961
If that's the game you want to play, the rate just went up 10 percent.

667
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:15,340
If you are trying to extort us because we are immigrants, we know the law.

668
01:00:15,758 --> 01:00:18,260
I'm extorting you because you are breaking the law.

669
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,930
Which charge would you like to be arrested for?

670
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:24,099
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution? Take your pick.

671
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:26,852
You come to this country, take advantage of it...

672
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:30,105
...and think because we are tolerant, we are weak and helpless.

673
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,149
Your arrogance offends me.

674
01:00:32,357 --> 01:00:34,318
For that, the rate went up 10 percent.

675
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:38,614
Now, do you want to get down to business or to keep playing?

676
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
- How much? - Twenty percent.

677
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:45,329
And you have my word it'll not go up for a year.

678
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:57,467
How do you say "sugar" in your language?

679
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:13,023
You've made a very good investment, gentlemen.

680
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:14,358
See you in a month.

681
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:22,492
A friend gave this to me. It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

682
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:36,506
Good luck.

683
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,048
- Good luck. - Good luck.

684
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:40,635
- Good luck. Good luck. - Good luck.

685
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,229
You don't remember me.

686
01:01:53,022 --> 01:01:55,024
We spoke on the phone two days ago.

687
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:00,029
I told you I would find you.

688
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:06,095
Kim.

689
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:22,027
Amanda.

690
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,023
Wake up!

691
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:01,316
I need you to be focused.

692
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,363
Are you focused yet?

693
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:17,374
Where is this girl?

694
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,710
Where is she?

695
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,076
You know, we used to outsource this kind of thing.

696
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:54,912
But what we found was the countries we outsourced to...

697
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,458
...had unreliable power grids. Very Third World.

698
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:00,960
You'd turn on a switch, power wouldn't come on...

699
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:05,130
...and then tempers would get short. People would resort to pulling fingernails.

700
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,633
Acid drips on bare skin.

701
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:10,260
The whole exercise would become counterproductive.

702
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:12,096
But here, the power's stable.

703
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:14,599
Here, there's a nice even flow.

704
01:05:14,765 --> 01:05:18,060
Here, you can flip a switch and the power stays on all day.

705
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:23,483
Where is she?

706
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:48,382
Now, I don't have any more time to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

707
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:51,135
Give me what I need or this switch'll stay on...

708
01:05:51,301 --> 01:05:54,263
...till they turn power off for lack of payment on the bill.

709
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:56,807
Where is my daughter?

710
01:05:57,349 --> 01:06:00,770
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

711
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,147
She was virgin, lot of money.

712
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:05,483
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

713
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:09,153
To who?

714
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,489
I don't know.

715
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:15,826
- What? - Saint-Clair.

716
01:06:16,326 --> 01:06:17,327
Saint-Clair.

717
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,330
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair. Is that a person, a place?

718
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:24,960
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

719
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:26,170
Patrice Saint-Clair.

720
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:28,673
Where can I find him?

721
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:31,509
I don't know, I don't know.

722
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:35,012
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

723
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,473
Please! I don't know!

724
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,644
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

725
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,646
Please.

726
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:45,898
Not that. Please.

727
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:47,483
I believe you.

728
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,572
But it's not gonna save you.

729
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,597
Look who dropped by.

730
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,016
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

731
01:07:21,225 --> 01:07:22,226
Jean-Claude.

732
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:24,895
The children waited up for you.

733
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:28,398
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat before everything gets cold.

734
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,067
Bryan, will you do the honors?

735
01:07:30,275 --> 01:07:32,194
- Sure. - I'll be just a minute.

736
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:04,894
I was just telling Bryan how nice it's been...

737
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,229
...since you left the old job for the new one.

738
01:08:07,396 --> 01:08:10,232
Home every night for dinner, get to see the kids more.

739
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:13,443
Yeah, must be nice coming home every night, seeing your kids.

740
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:15,738
Bryan has been thinking about relocating.

741
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:17,615
- Really? - Yes.

742
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:19,617
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

743
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:22,453
- White or dark meat? - Dark, please.

744
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,954
Find anything interesting?

745
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:27,917
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

746
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:31,295
People there know someone that works in your office.

747
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:33,506
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

748
01:08:33,673 --> 01:08:35,966
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

749
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:39,804
Always seems like he's about to have a problem. Carrots?

750
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:41,806
I got to the bottom of it, Jean-Claude.

751
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:43,307
I know everything.

752
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:46,310
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

753
01:08:47,687 --> 01:08:50,523
- What shit? - This is not the time or place, Bryan.

754
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,775
- Are you involved? - Involved in what?

755
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:54,944
What are you two talking about?

756
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:58,698
- Are you? - My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

757
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:00,950
As long as my family is provided for...

758
01:09:01,116 --> 01:09:03,703
...I do not care where the difference comes from.

759
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,788
That is my entire involvement.

760
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,957
- What about my family? - I told you...

761
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:10,543
...I would help as long as it didn't cause trouble.

762
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,044
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

763
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:15,715
I don't know, I don't care. I am driving you to the airport.

764
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,174
Jean-Claude.

765
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,344
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

766
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,304
- I'm not finished yet. - Yes, you are.

767
01:09:22,555 --> 01:09:25,390
- No! - No, I'm not.

768
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:33,357
That's what happens when you sit behind a desk. You forget things.

769
01:09:33,566 --> 01:09:36,026
Like the weight in the hand of a gun that's loaded.

770
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:39,238
Isabelle!

771
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:41,866
It's a flesh wound.

772
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:45,703
But if you don't get me what I need, the last thing you'll see...

773
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:47,872
...is the bullet I put between her eyes.

774
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,125
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

775
01:10:02,762 --> 01:10:04,555
You could've made this less painful...

776
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:08,851
...if you had been more concerned about my daughter and less about your desk.

777
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,353
Please apologize to your wife for me.

778
01:11:16,627 --> 01:11:19,464
- Can I help you? - Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

779
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:21,215
Your name, please.

780
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:27,137
I'm sorry, your name is not on the list.

781
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:28,848
Oh, please check again.

782
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:33,644
Inside.

783
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:22,527
May I help you, sir?

784
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,660
- Your champagne. - Yeah, I will take it.

785
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:43,714
I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.

786
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:47,510
Fifty thousand.

787
01:12:49,094 --> 01:12:52,347
One hundred, 100,000.

788
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:57,352
One hundred, 150.

789
01:12:58,437 --> 01:12:59,605
I have 150.

790
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:02,399
Your champagne, sir.

791
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:05,903
Two, I have two, 250.

792
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,071

- You will never get away with this. - Lf you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

820
01:15:12,488 --> 01:15:14,949
Now, Mr?

821
01:15:21,163 --> 01:15:24,584
Well, we know you're not this man. So, what do we call you?

822
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,839
It doesn't matter what we call you...

823
01:15:30,005 --> 01:15:32,467
...what does matter is what you're doing here.

824
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:35,761

I wish I could, honestly.

827
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:46,897
See, I'm a father myself.

828
01:15:47,106 --> 01:15:49,108
I have two sons and a daughter...

829
01:15:49,274 --> 01:15:52,277
...but let me tell you something, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

830
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:53,779
This is a business.

831
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:55,740
This is a very unique business...

832
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:58,618
...with a very unique clientele. - I'll pay.

833
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:01,286
In this business, you have no refunds, returns...

834
01:16:01,496 --> 01:16:03,539
...discounts, buybacks. All sales are final.

835
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:08,586
Besides discretion, it's about the only rule we have.

836
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:13,048
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

837
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:13,651
Would you please go see which part of "quietly"...

838
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:16,487
...they did not understand? - Yes, sir.

839
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:39,469
Okay, we can resolve this. I know how you feel.

840
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:42,304
We should talk, okay? We can work this out.

841
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:46,308
You have no idea...

842
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:48,644
- Where is she? - Please.

843
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:50,104
Understand. Please try...

844
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:57,862
There's a boat by the quay.

845
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:00,573
Please understand.

846
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:05,119
It was all business, it wasn't personal.

847
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:07,037
It was all personal to me.

848
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:05,164
We can...

849
01:25:17,134 --> 01:25:20,846
- Daddy. - Kim.

850
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:23,766
You came for me.

851
01:25:28,312 --> 01:25:29,814
You came for me.

852
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,610
I told you I would.

853
01:26:03,598 --> 01:26:06,726
May I have your attention. If you're waiting for oversized bags...

854
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:10,145
Mom.

855
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:13,858
Oh, my God.

856
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:16,527
Oh, sweetie.

857
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:19,530
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

858
01:26:19,697 --> 01:26:21,616
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

859
01:26:22,992 --> 01:26:25,160
I've got everything I need.

860
01:26:25,327 --> 01:26:27,913
I love you so much.

861
01:26:30,082 --> 01:26:32,167
Stuart.

862
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:35,045
Thank you.

863
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:45,264
Attention, travelers. You are not required to...

864
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:47,391
Shall we go?

865
01:26:52,396 --> 01:26:54,899
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

866
01:26:55,525 --> 01:27:00,154
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks. - All right.

867
01:27:08,454 --> 01:27:10,665
- I love you, Dad. - Love you too.

868
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:36,774
- Where are we? - I told you. It's a surprise.

869
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:40,695
- Hi. - Hi.

870
01:27:43,614 --> 01:27:47,076
When someone says "hi," it's usually polite to say "hi" back.

871
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:48,911
Hi.

872
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:50,580
I heard you wanna be a singer.

873
01:27:50,746 --> 01:27:52,498
- I do. - She does.

874
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:57,462
Well, come on in. Let's see what you got.
