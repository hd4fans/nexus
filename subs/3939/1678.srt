1
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,220


2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,950
BROOKLYN, NY One hour earlier

3
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,410
You're lying to me.

4
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,480
l'm not. l don't know what you're talking about.

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,620
l don't know what you want from me.

6
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,980
l swear l don't .

7
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,320
l have three children.

8
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,790
The first thing you have to learn as a father,

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,160
is to know when your children are lying to you.

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
You're lying to me.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,200
And if you don't stop,

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,100
l'm going to use one of those tortures your people are so famous for...

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,730
...on your little body, until you tell me what l want to know!

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,570
For the last time...

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,250
Give me the numbers!

16
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,150
NANJlNG, CHlNA One year earlier

17
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,240


18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,960
Try it the other way,

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,790
it adds up to three hundred and sixty five...

20
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,450
Only one answer is correct.

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,370
l mean no disrespect, Mr. Sook,

22
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,100
...but your calculations are wrong.

23
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,040
Mei...

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,380
we're going to move you to a different school.

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,950
But all my friends are here, and my mother...

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,190
Mei. you are so smart, a genius.

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,320
You have to go to an appropriate school...

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,520
You'll make new friends.

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,230
Don't бо be sad Mei, we'll always be your friends.

30
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,460
l hear the kids in Beijing are cool,

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,760
you'll have a good time there.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800
But l don't even like numbers.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,470
l like my friends here.

34
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,100
l don't want new friends.

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,370
l don't like math.

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,340
Of course you do...

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,440


38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,310
don't worry, we'll send you a letter every week.

39
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,880
You promise? Of course.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Think we want to miss out on having a famous friend

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,250


42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,180
lt's gonna be great, Mei...

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,820
THE MEADOWLANDS, NJ

44
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,270
How dare you come here?

45
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,730
You have no right! Mom, mom! Enough! Stop!

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,600
You have no right to be here.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,630
You should be in jail.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,110
You get out of here!

49
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,940
- l'm sorry. - l'll kill you.

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,890
Piece of garbage!

51
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,690
He should never have been in there with me!

52
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,500
Come on! What, are you crazy man?

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,660
Get off!

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,540
l never liked you, Luke.

55
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,670
You're a better fighter than ninety percent of the guys you go into the cage with.

56
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,740
But you just let 'em pound on you like you're a side of beef.

57
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,150
You already lost to every chump in the circuit.

58
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,350
But last night, of all nights!

59
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,280
You're supposed to go down in the second, you son of a bitch!

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,450
Once. l hit him once!

61
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,920
Where'd you find him, in the fucking playground?

62
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,260
YouTube, you asshole!

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,360
The kid is an lnternet sensation, until you put him in a coma.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
Which frankly, l do not give a shit about!

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,470
But you cost me a million dollars!

66
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,590
Which is nothing compared to what you cost Docheski.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,340
Yeah, you recognize the name?

68
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,870
He was betting on you, big time to take the dive!

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,710
And he's going to take it out on me, too.

70
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,580
Because he knows l'm the schmuck who set this whole thing up.

71
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,040
Unless, l deliver your head with a down payment.

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,550
You know how the Russians are.

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,310


74
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,780
This is my niece, Bai Yu.

75
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,940
Recognize her?

76
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,650
She's in my class at school.

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,880
She says you mind is like a computer.

78
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,160
We spoke to your teacher and he said the same thing.

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,820
That's why you're here.

80
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,320
Lovely girl.

81
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,760
Computers are so annoying, they leave trails that are easy to follow.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,700


83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,510


84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,310
They say what you learn you never forget. ls that so?

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,030
Then we will go to your home and kill your mother

86
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,090
for making such a stupid girl.

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,450
So they are telling the truth.

88
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,880
Mr. Sook also said your father ran away when you were very little,

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,280
left your mother,

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,920
And you mother is very ill.

91
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,620
Soon you will be all alone. So you want to be all alone?

92
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,190
Then we will take good care of your mother.

93
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,940
This is Chang, your new father.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,780
He will take you far over the ocean,

95
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,850
where our enemies like to make trouble for us.

96
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,850
Once you are there... You will count for us.

97
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,880
You've got the Wright number, to leave the right message.

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Call me when you get this Annie.

99
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,460
Leave right away.

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,030
lf you're out, don't go home.

101
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,390
lf l'm scaring you, that's good. Call me.

102
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,260
Annie?

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,620
He has some nice videos.

104
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,660
That's it?

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,360
l heard you were some kind of tough guy.

106
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,360
No fighting?

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,340
You're just going to sit on the floor like a dog who wants to die.

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,900
Sorry it had to be so messy.

109
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,600
The boy is still learning.

110
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,980
And l'm not a doctor, but l think she was eating for two.

111
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,320
We're like the Charlie Manson family. No?

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,320
My father was going to send someone else, but l'm making my bones.

113
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,690
You make your bones by killing someone who could hurt you back.

114
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,180
And who would that be?

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,970
You? Well, why not? You just killed you wife.

116
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,970
l didn't kill her. You did.

117
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,970
But, you want to hurt me?

118
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,170
Good. l'd like to see you try.

119
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,010
Get it over with.

120
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,520
Over? You cost my father money. Made my family look bad.

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,620
Now, we're going to make an extra special example out of you.

122
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,190
So, we looked into your records. Not much to find.

123
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,790
Worked for City, Garbage collections, Sanitation.

124
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,260
Good benefits, but no glamor.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,630
Father and mother, dead.

126
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,170
No brothers or sisters.

127
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,570
Which is too bad,

128
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,830
 because l would like to take them from you too.

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,170
But you loved your wife. We know that.

130
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,180
So, here's the deal. You are free to go.

131
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,850
But we will have eyes on you.

132
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,720
Not always. But when you least expect it, we'll be there.

133
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,260
Anyone you try to make friends with, or even talk to...

134
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,930
...other than ordering a hot dog or something,

135
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,030
 will die.

136
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,200
Like your wife. Because of you.

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Of course you can always end it.

138
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,500
Jump off a bridge, throw yourself in front of a train.

139
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,370
Damn your eternal soul to Hell.

140
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,210
lf you believe in that kind of bull shit.

141
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,040
Personally l don't , so l'd go for it if l were you.

142
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,010
But, l am not you. Thank God.

143
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,980
So do what you want.

144
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,060
lf you're still here tomorrow, we're going to kill the land lady.

145
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,660
What was her name? Tobolovski, or something.

146
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,420
Mrs. Tobolovski.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,020
Nice lady.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,830
Clean up the mess, Garbage man.

149
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,380
Alright, she's your daughter, and she's an American citizen.

150
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,510
l ain't going to ask what the deal is with her.

151
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,040
That is your business.

152
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,150
But l'm going to tell you, pulling strings is hard work.

153
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,670
And hard work don't come free.

154
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,850
Your price, Captain Wolf?

155
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,790
Chinatown Precinct take goes up twenty percent.

156
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,030
Bronx, hundred twenty first,

157
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,200
Brooklyn Divisions each go up by ten percent.

158
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,360
Monthly.

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,130
That's a steep price for a passport and some papers for a little girl.

160
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,800
Things are tough all over.

161
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,640
Chinatown gets up ten percent.

162
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,380
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle for the current rate.

163
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,020
And the fact that we won't start shooting cops and their families in the streets...

164
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,140
...like dogs at the first sign of pressure.

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,120

You'll have a new floor boss tonight.

200
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,450
lf the tally comes up short again, he won't be the only one who suffers.

201
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,600
What?

202
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,620
Why?

203
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,870
Because he was hurting business, and business is a serious matter.

204
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,770
l understand business.

205

But why beat him if you're going to kill him anyway.

206
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,310
lf you're asking me that, it means you still don't understand business.

207
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,150
Now be quiet and eat.

214
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,770
You ain't going to eat in here. You got to get a shirt first. Just go back, man.

They better be here in the morning...

220

...or you'll be wearing them on your ears.

221
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,460
Because l'll chew your feet off at the God damn ankles.

222
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,040
l could really use some new shoes, man.

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,980

Shut up, shut up.

227
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,320
Shut up and take 'em. l've still got my old ones.

228
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,900
Go get those feet looked at.

229
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,300
Gangrene is setting in.

231
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,830
Thank you, man.

233
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,210

239
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,990
Your mother is gone.

240
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,250
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

241
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,090
They weren't going to tell you.

242
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,000
But l'm telling you, so that you can pray for her soul to find its way to heaven.

243
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,140
Please don't say anything. lf they found out l told you.

244
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,040
l won't say anything. Thank you.

245
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,880
Everybody up. Shelter needs to be cleared by nine AM.

246
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,520
Remember, reservations for tonight must be made before by three thirty.

247
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,750
So you want to tell us what happened?

248
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,030
Someone liked his shoes.

249
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,430
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

250
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,630
You know, you guys are a Hell of a crack Security Squad.

251
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,440
You were right here. You could have said something.

252
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,900
But you were too busy sleeping off this contraband. Right?

253
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,010
Come into this shelter again,

254
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,840
and l will run your raggedy ass back out into the street.

255
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,610

l've memorized it.

257
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,410
This is an extremely important number.

258
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,580
For your mother's sake, answer me carefully.

259
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,150
Are you sure you have memorized it?

260
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,650
l can repeat it for you, but it would be long and boring.

261
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,460
Look at that. here hardly for a year, and already she has American attitude.

262
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,140
lf she says she remembers it,

263
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,010
she remembers it.

264
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,140
l can vouch for that.

265
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,450


266
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,950

Hey! Watch where you're going, man!

268
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,290
You could get your ass kicked for that. Okay? Huh?

269
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,740
Four fifty five.

270
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,080
lf you got no money, you got to get out of line.

271
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,310
l got money.

272
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,460
He doesn't have any money. Look at him.

273
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,910
Mister, l told you, if you don't have money you have to leave. Okay?

274
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,650
You have to get out of line. People are waiting.

275
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,290
Come on buddy, you have to go.

276
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
ls this guy giving you trouble?

277
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,790
He's crazy officer, get him out of here.

278
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,980
Alright come on, let us go.

279
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,880
Hey you! Come on, lets go! Out, on the street!

280
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,790
Let us go funny boy. You want to be a clown, go join the circus, not in my Precinct.

281
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,760
You hear me? l don't want to see you around here. Hey.

282
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,130
Jesus Christ.

283
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,230
Look at what the cat dragged in.

284
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,000
Unbelievable.

285
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,940
 Look at him.

286
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,710
Look at him?

287
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,710
How about the smell?

288
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,220
l'll call the boys.

289
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,930
Mei, these are your instructions:

Welcome back to the force.

296
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,560
You're learning fast.

297
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,760

299

l'm sorry. l can't let them have you.

300
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,760
How's your day been, Luke?

301
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,030
Started lousy. But it's looking up.

302
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,270
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop.

303
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,310
Once upon a time. Always could take a shot.

304
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,040
But you know what your real talent is? You're a uniter.

305
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,110
l mean, who'd have thought that us and the Ruskies

306
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,850
would ever be on the same page about anything?

307
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,010
Not me.

308
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,180
Nice to see you, rat.

309
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,520
l've been wanting to do this ever since the day you opened your big fucking mouth!

310
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,390
We heard what Docheski did to you. l mean, l had to laugh.

311
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,000
l mean, we felt bad for Annie and all but them's the breaks.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,530
She knew who she was with.

313
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,400
When word come up you were on the street you were back.

314
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,170
We couldn't believe our fucking ears.

315
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,640
Now, why would you come back?

316
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,240
Why wouldn't you disappear somewhere far away?

317
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,570
Like the Moon.

318
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,670
l missed home.

319
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,680
You were one of us, Luke. We were a team.

320
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,620
We were family. Then you threw us under the bus.

321
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,450
We were Kings, you son of a bitch!

322
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,620
Now, we are a bunch of god damned serfrs!

323
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,220
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, easy Benoit.

324
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,170
When you come back, We figured you wanted to die.

325
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,540
You know, we got a pool going on when you're going to end it, and how.

326
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,170
You know. Bus, train...

327
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,880
l got my money on suicide by cop.

328
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,940
Come on, take it.

329
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,540
Take a shot. Come on.

330
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,360
Annie's waiting for you.

331
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,720
Question is, do you really think she wants to see you again?

332
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,220
Actually, my real talent

333
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,390
is costing other people money.

334
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,730
You ought to know that, Lasky. You're going to lose that bet.

335
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,330
Unless you want to shoot me in the back.

336
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,340
lt wouldn't be your first time.

337
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,840
Why don't you just end it?

338
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,380
What are you waiting for,

339
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,850
more people around you to die?

340
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,780
What are you waiting for?

341
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,590
For the last time. Give me the numbers.

342
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,270
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

343
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,050
But do you know how exactly what you can do?

344
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,060
Where you're going to be and when?

345
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,290
Someone told you.

346
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,860
That's right. Can you guess who?

347
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,470
Let her in.

348
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,110
A friend. The one who told you who told you about your poor mother.

349
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,510
When the scum who took you from home would not.

350
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,670
She's working for us with a smile.

351
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,250
Mei, l tell these men what they want to know,

352
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,960
and they pay me lots and lots of money.

353
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,720
Do the same and they will help you too.

354
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,830
You are a stupid woman.

355
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,400
ln English.

356
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,740
You gave them what they want, now they're going to kill you.

357
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,400
l said, speak in English.

358
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,760
Well?

359
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,780
She won't tell me anything.

360
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,180
My father is a patient man.

361
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,110
l am not.

362
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,950
Tell him what he wants to know, or l will kill you.

363
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,860
NYPD, open the door!

364
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,190
What the Hell? This is the Police. We got a report of a disturbance.

365
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,760
Look, you can make this easy, or you can it hard.

366
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,870
Open the door, or we come in by force!

367
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,110
Bull shit Blue!

368
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,370
You come in here, you go out feet first. l swear on my mother!

369
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,980
Yeah, they're in there Captain.

370
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,250
l don't know what the Hell you're looking for

371
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,780
but they are not cooperating.

372
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,120
You'd better get down here before things go to Hell.

373
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Negative, negative, this is big.

374
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,960
l'm going back to the station to monitor the city.

375
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,020
l'll get back to you.

376
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,360
Alright, we've got them pinned down, you know what l want.

377
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,800
We have a deal.

378
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,470
Get the girl. Alive if you can, dead if you can't .

379
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,540
We go in, Brooklyn stake goes up by ten percent.

380
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,870
That's the new deal.

381
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,870
Hold on, l got an incoming call.

382
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,410
Hey, Emile. What's up?

383
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,410
Back your men off, Wolf.

384
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,480
Whatever the Chinese offer to you, l'll up it by five percent.

385
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,520
Get here back here!

386
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,840
Alright Quan, l have the Russians offering up Brooklyn's stake by seven percent, Bronx is the same.

387
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,170
l don't know what to tell you.

388
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,680
l talked to my guys, they're willing to go to war over this.

389
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,780
You know, you're going to be stuck between us and the Russians and us like Hitler; fighting on two fronts.

390
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,720
So you had better think hard about this one.

391
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,280
Ten percent, both precincts; final offer.

392
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,330
Hey Mack, both these bastards are willing to pay a stiff price

393
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,670
for this little Chink girl.

394
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,840
What ever she's got, l want it.

395
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,070
So what is our play?

396
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,570
l get the Russians to drop their guard, you go in.

397
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,840
lf she catches a bullet l want you to take out everyone

398
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,610
last one of those Bolshevik scumbags.

399
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,580
Alright Emile, your offer is good.

400
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,990
l'm going to call my guys off, but only because l like you better.

401
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,660
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

402
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,160
You got the scent of something big and now you want it all for yourself.

403
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,750
But l have to pay something before you send your men in gun blazing.

404
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,030
She is gone.

405
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,300
What do you mean, she is gone?

406
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,740
l mean, she escaped.

407
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,540
And will all your men out there l can't follow.

408
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,140
l offer you a truce until we find her.

409
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,610
Trust me, if the Chinese find her first,

410
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,140
that will be a thing you regret as long as you live.

411
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,440
Docheski,

412
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,390
what does she have?

413
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,860
Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?

414
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,160
The girl is Chinese, eleven years old.

415
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,990
She speaks Mandarin and English.

416
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,530
Her photo is being disseminated.

417
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,730
You are to find her and bring her straight to Center Street.

418
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,500
Move now, she is headed for subway.

419
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,220
The police have screwed us.

420
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,420
ls that so?

421
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,920
That's all you have to say?

422
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,750
You're an idiot.

423
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:17,450
lf you don't find the girl before the police do...

424
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,160
your head will be gone in an instant.

425
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,440
Let's go to war.

426
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,370
Sorry, Annie.

427
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,230
Lost my lock on the Russian Cell on " J" Street.

428
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,400
Sounds like they went into the Subway Station,

429
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,970
Manhattan bound.

430
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,190
You? The garbage collector?

431
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,820
You got bad information.

432
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,460
l never collected garbage.

433
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,690
l disposed of it.

434
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,160
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.

435
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,370
Are you all right?

436
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,040
Get out, get out. Move.

437
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,840
lt's okay.

438
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,830
When found, she is to be brought to Captain Wolf at Center Street.

439
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,150
Whoa, easy. Easy there, Hon. We're the police...

440
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,620
...everything's alright.

441
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,910
Hey, what's you name, Hon?

442
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,130
This is her. l don't know, they all look alike to me.

443
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,220
You got that picture up? Yeah, let me see.

444
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,900
Fucking New York City,

445
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,910
don't see somebody for years...

446
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,140
...and you bump into them twice in the same day.

447
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,010
Hey, hey. l'm not going to hurt you.

448
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,360
What the Hell did you do, kid?

449
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,540
You know, those men who are chasing you are bad.

450
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,850
You want to tell me why they're after you?

451
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,870
Do you understand me?

452
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,050
Do you speak English?

453
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,090
What do you mean Chemyakin and the others disappeared? Someone else has taken her.

454
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,560
No, not the police.

455
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,330
He nearly killed a couple of cops.

456
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,470
Not the Chinese, either.

457
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,070
l don't know who the hell he is.

458
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,810
Then kill him, and take the girl alive.

459
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,370
lf you can't , then kill her too.

460
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,600
The other way. Cars go the other way!

461
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
Are you crazy, man?

462
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,470
Hold on.

463
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,310
This goes on, a lot of innocent people are going to get hurt.

464
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,650
You want that?

465
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,580
Good, then do what l say.

466
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,050
Are you okay?

467
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,430
Let us go.

468
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,300
l'm not five years old.

469
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,330
Then keep up.

470
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,690
You had her, and you lost her.

471
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,550
No Captain, we didn't lose her.

472
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,830
She was taken by force.

473
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,560
The Russians. No, not the Russians.

474
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,840
Well, it was Luke Wright.

475
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,840
What? - Captain Wolf. - Not now, Deke.

476
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,970
The mayor wants you, Captain.

477
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,350
Put him through on two. He is not on the phone.

478
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,580
He wants you at the mansion. Yesterday.

479
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,650
Here you go.

480
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,220
Thank you Mister lvanov.

481
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,120
Thank you.

482
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,540
Mister lvanov? Here you are Mister lvanov.

483
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,170
Room 1012 on the tenth floor.

484
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,470
Thank you.

485
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,460
You like a nice hotel.

486
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,460
l never stayed in a nice hotel.

487
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,460
No one is going to look for us in one.

488
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,560
She's in the area,

489
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,810
but there's a lot of interfrerence...

490
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,070
l can't be more specific.

491
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,900
Wait...

492
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,540
wait!

493
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,840
Got her.

494
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,580
Man, would l like a shower.

495
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,080
You could use one.

496
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,760
l could've just let those Russians grab you on the train.

497
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,130
Why did you save me?

498
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,570
l didn't save you.

499
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,500
You saved me.

500
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,670
l'm paying you back.

501
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,940
My name is Luke.

502
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,980
Mei.

503
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,650
You have parents, Mei?

504
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,220
l have a father.

505
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,200
What's his name?

506
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,490
Chang Quan.

507
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,570
Chang Quan.

508
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,400
lf we're talking about the same guy,

509
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,200
he didn't have any kids last time l checked.

510
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,000
Any that he made since wouldn't be a day over three years old.

511
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,140
l'm adopted.

512
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,110
Did he bring you over from back home?

513
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,920
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

514
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,920
Why are you here, Mei?

515
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,620
To count.

516
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,900
You were send over by the old guy, Chang's boss. What's his name?

517
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,600
Old school.

518
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,270
No computers, no electronic trails.

519
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,930
Just what you have in our head. Right?

520
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,990
You know Jiao Han?

521
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,150
l know of him.

522
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,490
He told me a number, a very long number.

523
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,960
l was going someplace where l would get another number and instructions.

524
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,990
But the Russians came and shot everyone.

525
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,100
Then the police came and l ran away.

526
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,000
Now you know everything. Happiness for you?

527
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,070
You want to go back to Han Jiao?

528
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,580
l make too much trouble. Bad business.

529
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,020
After l do what he asks, he kills me.

530
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,920
Good business. So, what about this number?

531
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,250
lt is long boring number.

532
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,980
l can tell it to you.

533
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,020
lt wouldn't mean anything to me.

534
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,920
But how do you know it is one number and not a bunch of separate numbers?

535
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,540
You're a crazy man. But not so stupid.

536
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,000
ls there anything interesting to you about these numbers?

537
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,180
Maybe a few of them.

538
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,480
Why?

539
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,210
Because they have a three or a seven before them.

540
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,680
All the numbers are random.

541
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,220
But, five of them have a seven before it.

542
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,990
And eight of them have a three before it.

543
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,920
That's too many times to be random.

544
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,090
lt's a code.

545
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,520
What else?

546
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,320
Nothing.

547
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,530
So, it's the three and the seven that are interesting.

548
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,660
Because they happen too many times to be random.

549
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,010
Because they're not numbers, they're words.

550
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,470
Right-left, or left-right.

551
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,480
Old school,

552
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,740
a combination to a safe.

553
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,390
ln the hotel?

554
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,520
Where? That's as close as l can track.

555
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,640
What do you have for me?

556
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,110
We're looking for a man now, who is supposed to be with the girl...

557
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,410
He's armed and to be considered extremely dangerous.

558
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,010
Dispatch says he's ...

559
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,550
About five, eleven, brown hair, thirties...

560
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,680
Ah, probably came in here less than a few hours ago.

561
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,920
Sir, we're not allowed to discuss our guests.

562
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,320
So, he's a guest? Did he check in?

563
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,320
l'm sorry, sir. We're not at liberty to...

564
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,860
He would be with a Chinese girl, eleven years old.

565
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,860
l'm her father. And l'm very worried about her.

566
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,690
l'm so sorry. l can call the police for you.

567
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,200
Do that and l blow your brains out.

568
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,800
Now, what room is he in?

569
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,800
What room is he in?

570
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,080
l think maybe, l put him on the tenth floor.

571
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,310
Room!

572
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,350
l swear he didn't have a little girl with him.

573
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,620
Room.

574
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,360
l just need to check. Then check quick.

575
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,820
Before l put a bullet in your brain.

576
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,420
Quick! Put your hands up.

577
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,000
You don't want any part of this!

578
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,460
Hands up so l can see them.

579
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,800
No one leaves the hotel!

580
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,450
Come on!

581
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,150
Ten, twelve. He's in room ten, twelve.

582
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,280
l thought you said no one would look for us here.

583
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,220
lt's off. l turned it off. So no one could call.

584
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,520
lt doesn't need to be on.

585
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,120
Get back!

586
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,730
Get down on the floor!

587
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,240
Everybody get back!

588
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:44,540
Write down the numbers. Just the ones with the three and seven in front of them. Quick.

589
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,180
You get over there!

590
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,370


591
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,910
Get up!

592
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,820
l'll try to get you someplace safe.

593
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,120
lf we get separated, don't tell them you told me anything. Lie.

594
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,790
lf they try to scare you...

595
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,460
Try? l'm so scared already.

596
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,490
Yeah, me too. Remember, lie.

597
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,760
We're almost there.

598
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,160
lf you see them downstairs try not to kill the girl.

599
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,110
Get back inside.

600
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,850
Follow them! l'm going back down to cut them off.

601
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,320
The cops are here.

602
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,020
Hold them off until l give the word.

603
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,180
Do not let them in!

604
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,790
Everybody stay down!

605
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,890
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

606
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,620
Everybody's going to sit down!

607
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,360
Go! Get back! Get down!

608
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,380
Go!

609
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,870


610
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,670
Get up! Everybody up.

611
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,020
We're getting out of the hotel.

612
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,650
Up!

613
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,620
Or l start killing you. Up!

614
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,330
At the corner of 58th, we got a suspect.

615
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,820
Hey! Don't move.

616
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,030
Don't move.

617
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,880
lnto the street! Keep moving!

618
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,710
Anyone who doesn't dies like this.

619
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,110
lnto the street!

620
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,820
Go!

621
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,150
Hold your fire!

622
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,970
Suspects in the crowd. We can't lD them.

623
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,050
Hey! Stop right there!

624
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,730


625
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,650
Hey! Hey! What the Hell are you doing?

626
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,250
That's my car!

627
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,520
Look! That guy took my fucking car!

628
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,240
Head downtown, l'll give you an address in a minute.

629
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,990
Shit!

630
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,870
Hey Buddy, you want to give me an address? Piotor lvanovov Hey Buddy, you want to give me an address?

631
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,730
Piotor lvanovov ln a minute, just hold on.

632
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,130
ln a minute, just hold on.

633
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,440


634
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,320
Who's this? Who do you think? lt's Piotor.

635
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,590
Don't you have me in your phone?

636
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,260
Piotor? Police reports said you were found on the subway, with...

637
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,460
Police reports were wrong.

638
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,230
The others got...

639
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,530
What's that?

640
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,330
Sorry, bad connection.

641
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,830
l have the number.

642
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,550
You what? Before the guy grabbed her, we got the number from her...

643
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,320
l've been ducking the cops for hours.

644
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,150
lgor, put this number into your phone.

645
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,920
Go ahead, give it to me.

646
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,790
Are you crazy?

647
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,790
lt's on a piece of paper a kilometer long.

648
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,160
Where are you?

649
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,100
He might be bringing the cops.

650
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,170
Should we clear the place out?

651
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,170
lf there are cops we're better off in a crowd.

652
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,400
Still, we need better positions.

653
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,140
Alright Piotor...

654
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,840
now's your chance to be a hero.

655
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,750
Mamoschka's .

656
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,110
Be here soon.

657
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,910
l'll be there.

658
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,370
He's here,

659
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,590
 Luke Wright, back in the city.

660
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,060
ln my city. Actually, he's been back for a while.

661
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,520
A while? What's a while?

662
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,590
Maybe a year, it's hard to say.

663
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,020
Turn that god damned thing off.

664
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,730
Alex.

665
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,500
What's going on Wolf?

666
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,400
And how is Luke Wright involved in it?

667
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,640
l figured l might ask you the same question.

668
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,370
Don't try to game me.

669
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,910
You're not even a pawn,

670
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,610
playing on a board so big you can't even see the edge.

671
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,010
That's all you've ever been.

672
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,180
l know about Luke Wright.

673
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,650
Which is more than you can say until five minutes ago.

674
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,120
What you know about Luke Wright rates less than a paragraph

675
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,990
in a very fat book.

676
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,490
After the towers fell,

677
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,560
and our manpower was spread out tracking terrorist activity...

678
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,700
l was the one who formed the special

679
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,730
task force to deal with the crime that was filling the gap.

680
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,140
And don't you ever fucking forget that l was the one who put you in charge.

681
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,210
l didn't forget, my work made you Mayor.

682
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,880
Your work.

683
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,540
You think Luke was just one of your cops?

684
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,950
When l put together your team, l knew l needed an edge.

685
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,480
No ordinary detectives could give me.

686
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,420
l needed something surgical.

687
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,260
l called friends in places buried so deep they don't officially exist.

688
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,490
They were sympathetic.

689
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,260
A week later they sent Luke Wright.

690
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,000
Those Wise Guys who vanished over the last seven years.

691
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,160
You think that was internecine war?

692
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,500
Those Coke Kings you found in the gutter in Harlem...

693
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,970
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn, Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

694
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,170
Luke Wright is a ghost.

695
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,540
A very deadly ghost.

696
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,340
And it worked like a charm, too.

697
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,010
Then you dicks had to get greedy and pad your pockets.

698
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:17,460
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

699
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,660
When he threatened to take the whole thing to lA...

700
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,830
...it took some people with a lot of bronze stuffed in their pajamas to talk him off the ledge.

701
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,530
Yeah, and my team gets dismantled and we're peons again.

702
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,100
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

703
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,090
how's he wind up in Jersey cage fighting in the B circuit?

704
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,660
Do l look like a shrink?

705
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,960
Get everybody on this.

706
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,610
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll

707
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,750
there's only on man in this city can take him on one on one.

708
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,210
Excuse me. l know this this is a closed door.

709
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,120
But there was just a major gun battle downtown at a hotel.

710
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,710
The media is going nuts. You're going to need to make a statement.

711
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,130
Han Jiao is in the city, also.

712
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,760
He gave this little Chinese girl something.

713
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,860
l don't know what.

714
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,430
-Luke Wright grabbed her before l could. - What?

715
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,070
- l said Luke Wright... - Yeah, yeah...

716
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,400
l heard you the first time.

717
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,170
Close every exit out of Manhattan.

718
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,810
Make sure the neither Wright or the girl gets away; you get commission.

719
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,280
Let 'em go; you got a shovel to dig your own grave.

720
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,850
That girl does not leave this city.

721
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,650
Who was this man who killed the Russians?

722
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,820
l don't know. He didn't tell me.

723
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,670
Did he ask you about the number?

724
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,570
Everyone asked me about the number.

725
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,740
And what did you tell them?

726
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,750
Nothing.

727
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,110
What?

728
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,950
Nothing.

729
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,330
You are lying!

730
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,760
l would never lie to you, Uncle Han.

731
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,930
Call our men back home.

732
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,400
Tell them to kill Mei's mother,

733
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,600
because her daughter is a deceitful liar.

734
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,240
l swear, Uncle Han.

735
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,370
l pretended l didn't speak English, or understand it.

736
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,580
They screamed and shouted but l didn't say anything,

737
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,910
because l knew it would upset you.

738
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,610
l swear on my mother.

739
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,960
We recovered the girl.

740
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,030
But the information might have been compromised.

741
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,690
Should we change our time frame?

742
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,860
lmpossible, now that the whole damn thing has gone super nova.

743
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,070
lf it's going to happen, it's going to happen tonight.

744
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,000
The meeting place needs to be changed.

745
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,440
Where to?

746
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,090
l'll let you know. Here. Right here.

747
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,310
Slow down.

748
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,480
 Stop the car.

749
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,250
No. You don't bring no hookers in my cab, man.

750
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,580
Just keep the meter running.

751
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,520
Ladies...

752
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,660
How about a drink.

753
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:19,990
Good evening.

754
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,240
Good evening. Will you be joining a reservation?

755
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,800
No, we don't have a reservation.

756
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,650
lt will be later tonight,

757
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:34,610
but we should be able to find you something.

758
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,510
You can sit upstairs, if you like.

759
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,700
Sir, do you have a preference?

760
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,790
l think we'll just get a drink at the bar.

761
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,880
Why don't you give me a kiss, turn around and walk out of here.

762
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,410
But l thought...

763
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,540
Just act like you forgot something outside.

764
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,980
Only, don't come back.

765
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:18,000
Give me a White Russian please, and a fork.

766
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,100
A fork?

767
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,120
Yeah, one of those.

768
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,600
l never know what to say in these moments.

769
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,530
What moments?

770
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,470
The ones before l kill somebody.

771
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,250


772
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,720
Boss!

773
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,600
What does he drive? And where is it parked?

774
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,770
lt's an SUV in the alley outside.

775
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,830
Vassily.

776
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,260
Not even close.

777
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,260
Who is this? The guy who's been killing your boys all night, Emile.

778
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,060
The guy who has your son tied up in a very dark place.

779
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,210
Now, here's what l want. Do you think l give a shit what you want?

780
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,770
Do you think you can blackmail me, because you have Vassily?

781
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,410
Kill him and go to Hell!

782
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,210
Oh, l'm going to Hell alright.

783
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,950
l'm not going to kill your boy.

784
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,050
l'm going to keep him around. Like a pet.

785
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,740
A very badly treated pet.

786
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,420
l'm going to do things to him that will make me ashamed to look in the mirror afterward.

787
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,150
But l will do them.

788
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,090
Vassily's going to tell me everything he knows about your operation.

789
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,260
And then what you going to do? Tell the police?

790
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,270
You want me to laugh? Who said anything about the police?

791
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,640
l'm going to share the information with the competition.

792
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,570
The one's l haven't already killed.

793
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,110
Anything they don't take from you, l will.

794
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,580
First, l'm going to take your trophy wife.

795
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,810
Then l'm going to take trophy children.

796
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,250
Then l'll leave you with nothing.

797
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,280
When l'm done, you won't even be a memory of a memory.

798
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,850
But that doesn't have to happen.

799
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,780
What do you want?

800
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,160
l want to know what is in the safe?

801
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,120
What safe? The safe the girl gave me the combination too. That safe.

802
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,430
Thirty million dollars.

803
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,700
The kid was on her way to get a second number.

804
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,700
What is in the second safe?

805
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,810
Something worth thirty million dollars.

806
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,150
To who?

807
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,240
No idea.

808
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,380
That is because you are only half smart, Emile.

809
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,350
So, here's the deal.

810
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,990
You tell me where the first safe is. l take the money and let your boy go.

811
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,790
Lie to me, and your world ends. You have my word on that.

812
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,260
ldiot.

813
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:09,570
l know when a man is working alone. And you're as alone as one can be.

814
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,800
You need a small army to get near that safe.

815
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,440
The kind of army l have.

816
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,410
Had.

817
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,640
lt's been shrinking by the minute.

818
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,270
Last chance before l hang up and go to work on your son.

819
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,580
You going to kill me, garbage man?

820
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,020
You could have taken us out that day, couldn't you?

821
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,090
But you just sat there. Let us ruin you.

822
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,430
Let us make you nothing.

823
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,860
l guess finding out about that safe gave you new motivation, Garbage man?

824
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,300
l wouldn't spend my time talking if l were you.

825
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,440
l'd spend it praying, when this is over,

826
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,000
that little girl is still alive.

827
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,810
Pray.

828
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:11,090
When and where? The underpass, under the bridge, one hour.

829
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,230
l'm sorry l pointed a gun at you,

830
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,030
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.

831
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,070
lt was... Business. l know.

832
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,230
That's good. lt's good you understand.

833
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,530
We're going to get this done.

834
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,370
And you'll be safe with me and uncle Han

835
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,110
l promise to be a better father to you than the one who left you and your mother.

836
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,480
There's no one in the world who cares more about you.

837
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,520
You know that, don't you?

838
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,150
Well, the gang's all here.

839
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,150
Almost.

840
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,560
Reddick have to call in sick?

841
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,870
He's in the hospital, dickhead! You broke his trachea.

842
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,560
l didn't know a trachea could brake. l hope they can fix it.

843
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,470
Yeah, how 'bout l fix you.

844
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,340
Hey, hey, hey... Not here.

845
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:34,280
Been a while, Luke.

846
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,080
Can't say l missed you.

847
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,410
So, let us get down to business.

848
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,180
Did you bring what l asked for?

849
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:46,720
Scotty's ?

850
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,880
Where else?

851
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,540
That's good.

852
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,860
l've been in restaurants all night.

853
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,290
All l got served was lead.

854
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,000
Anyone got a light?

855
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,110
You know what? Screw this!

856
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,640
Look, Cap, You asked us to come here. So we came.

857
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,310
But l ain't going to sit here and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

858
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,940
Shut up Kolfax.

859
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,310
Still haven't quit, huh?

860
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,060
Hey, what the hell is that? Combination to the safe with thirty million bucks in it.

861
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:04,800
Whoa, whoa, What the hell you filthy piece of shit.

862
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,670
The only place it exists now is in here.

863
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,510
Remember that next time your little trigger finger gets itchy.

864
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,110
Why would Han Jiao stash it right in the middle of Chinatown's

865
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,880
busiest gambling den?

866
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,880
Because of sleazbucket cops.

867
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,350
Like you Benoit, who collect off of Chinatown's busiest gambling den.

868
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,520
Where else would he be surrounded by dozens of armed men

869
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,190
without attracting police attention?

870
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,620
Alight Captain, how do we know this son-of-abitch is on the level?

871
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,260
Huh? He's a bum. Where'd you get your information?

872
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,830
There's an exchange happening tonight.

873
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,170
The Triad half of the deal is in the safe at the Casino.

874
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:39,370
No way l could get to it on my own. So l called on you, my old pals.

875
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,000
Thirty million split six ways is still a lot of money.

876
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,300
We're risking a lot, Captain.

877
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,180
You especially. Everybody knows you have a bright future.

878
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,590
Promised by who? Hizzonor?

879
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,650
What carrot is he teasing you with, Wolf?

880
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,890
He's going to let off the street knowing what you know?

881
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,890
Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Meaning his second term is going to come to an end,

882
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,300
and his old on the city goes puff.

883
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,990
Just like that, he's Joe Citizen again.

884
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,600
Thirty million would be a nice retirement package.

885
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,100
What's he giving the Chinks?

886
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,030
lf l knew that, l wouldn't be standing here with you assholes, would l?

887
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:18,540
Bright future, huh?

888
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,910
Big headlines.

889
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:24,820
"Hero cops take down New York City's biggest underground gambling operation.

890
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,750
Five million bucks apiece.

891
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,780
No one will ever know about it, just to give it that extra sweet taste.

892
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,030
Alright, who's been in there?

893
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,910
For Christ sake, who's been in there?

894
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,710
Me Cap.

895
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,150
You two, you're on point.

896
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,580
The place is packed with civilians. So exercise some judgement.

897
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,920
Remember, l got the combination.

898
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,890
You want that money? Watch my back.

899
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,390
Hey, where you going?

900
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:22,900
Don't move!

901
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,800


902
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,870
Hey you! Settle down!

903
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,520
This way!

904
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,460
Jesus!

905
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,840
Warn them!

906
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,470
Warn them!

907
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,060
Lasky, heads up!

908
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:07,510
Go!

909
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,290
Kolfax, take him out!

910
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,460
Cover him!

911
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,710
Open it! Take it!

912
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:18,380
Oh fuck! Aww shit!

913
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:39,940
Aw shit. l got to get out of here.

914
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,130
Aww fuck. Aw Captain...

915
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,280
God, you shit! Shoot a man in the back!

916
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,110
Son of a bitch!

917
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,110
Alright, Mears. Where're we going?

918
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,240
This way.

919
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,140
Move!

920
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,220
We've been attacked...

921
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,620
Not by the Russians. Buy the police l think...

922
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,390
But they're better than police.

923
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:06,420
We need help. They've killed a lot of our people.

924
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,600
Call Chang. Tell him as soon as he gets that number,

925
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,470
he is to take out their errand boy.

926
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,870
We'll have to decipher the code quickly...

927
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,070
Do as l said!

928
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,530
The Gates of Paradise. Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

929
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,090
Yeah, well let's not wait for an invitation.

930
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:06,020
Alright you bastard. Get started.

931
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,090
Here's how we do this.

932
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,440
You put down your guns...

933
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,660
...l open the safe.

934
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,300
You want to shoot me, go ahead.

935
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,840
Make your minds up quick, because the real cops will be here soon.

936
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,110
On the floor.

937
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,280
Come on you son of a bitch, what are you trying to pull.

938
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,690
l got right left switched.

939
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:10,740
lt's going to open.

940
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,500
Oh fuck!

941
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:29,860
You'll live.

942
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,330
Left, twenty six.

943
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:53,330
Captain Wolf, what the hell happened in here?

944
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,500
What do you think happened, huh?

945
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,070
We had a raid on the place go bad.

946
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,400
We got dead cops, casualties, get in there will ya!

947
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,500
Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.

948
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,870
l need a fleet of ambulances! Alright?

949
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,740
Call it in, will ya? l'll take my own busted ass to the hospital.

950
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,650
Not bad.

951
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,250
lf you weren't such a double dealing asshole,

952
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,710
l could almost like you.

953
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,350
Almost. Drive.

954
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,480
lt's a scratch.

955
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,350
l'm not going to kill you.

956
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,300
But l didn't say l was putting you up in the Ritz.

957
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,110
Wolf.

958
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,510
l have your money, Danny.

959
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,310
What?

960
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,570
You heard me.

961
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,350
Thirty million, five thousand and one thousand dollar bills.

962
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,250
- l want to talk... - No. No,

963
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,520
what you want to do is calm down so we can talk like adults.

964
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,360
Shut it, Danny.

965
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,560
l want to talk. But l don't want to talk to you.

966
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,590
l want to talk to your boyfriend.

967
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,830
This is Alex.

968
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,670
lt has been a while, Alex.

969
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,740
How did you get this number?

970
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,840
Come on, Alex. Reach up the Mayor's ass there you are.

971
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,110
A man has got to do, what a man has got to do.

972
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:20,920
Well, he was a better catch than Annie was anyway.

973
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,820
l never understood how you hooked up with a cow like that.

974
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,890
lt was never about her looks. lt was her sense of humor.

975
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,530
She is not so funny now, is she?

976
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,050
No, she is not, neither am l.

977
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,300
l have the money, Alex.

978
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,160
l had to kill a lot of people to get it, so listen up.

979
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,910
You haven't made the combination exchange yet.

980
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,910
What is in the other safe?

981
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,000
A disk.

982
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,480
Names, money trails...

983
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,080
...when our commanders sent the two of us to help Danny clean up the city,

984
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,920
they attached a price.

985
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,220
ln exchange Danny looked the other way...

986
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,620
...while the assets seized from every group deemed

987
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,290
a terrorist organization were funneled into their private accounts.

988
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,720
lt's amazing what people let you get away with

989
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,560
when they are scared and want to feel protected.

990
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,400
Amazing how many scumbags there are out there waiting to take advantage of it.

991
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,200
- Like you didn't . - l quit.

992
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,070
l bet that helps all those souls

993
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:11,730
you sent to meet their maker without due process,

994
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:13,740
rest a whole lot easier.

995
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:16,510
You thought you could atone by climbing into a cage

996
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,140
and allowing yourself to get beaten to a pulp.

997
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,010
Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.

998
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,750
l'm getting paid for services rendered.

999
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:27,520
Right. You sell the disk to the Chinese so they can black mail our old honchos.

1000
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,390
Take the thirty mil and waltz off with Danny to a Villa in the Bahamas.

1001
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,580
Bali, but whatever, eh?

1002
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:37,230
So, now you know. Now what?

1003
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,230
Now you're dealing with me.

1004
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,830
Alright, l'm turning around.

1005
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:41,920
No you're not.

1006
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,360
What are you talking about?

1007
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,270
You got the money, the Chinese have nothing l care about.

1008
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,170
No, they have something l do.

1009
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:04,440


1010
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,730
Give her the combination to your safe.

1011
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:14,360
And she will give you our number. We go to your location, you go to ours.

1012
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,000
When we've gotten the disk, we will explain the code.

1013
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,630
And you get the cash.

1014
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,130
That's the deal.

1015
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,840
Let's hear it.

1016
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,280
lt's a very long number. You'll want to write it down.

1017
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,010
Thank goodness l brought a pen. Huh?

1018
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,280
You might want to close your eyes.

1019
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,830
Have it your way.

1020
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,610
Come on, Luke.

1021
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,910
The old place. Just you and me.

1022
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,750
You're a friend of Luke's ?

1023
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,790
Not as far as you're concerned.

1024
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,340
The violence that has rocked the city tonight continued in a bloody gun battle...

1025
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,210
...in a Chinatown night club, less than an hour ago.

1026
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,540
This is really getting out of hand.

1027
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:37,070
You think? Thanks for that insight.

1028
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,480
Your Honor. Alex Rosen is on your private line.

1029
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,580
He says that it's urgent.

1030
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,650
Excuse me, your Honor... Back in five, don't bother me now.

1031
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,190
Why didn't he call me on my cell phone?

1032
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:51,130
l thought l told you to put all my calls through to the Cell phone.

1033
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,160
l always told you this place had lousy security standards.

1034
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,740
Well, that's because noboby's been crazy enough to come in here and pull a stunt like this.

1035
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,170
You got some balls, Luke.

1036
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,740
Yeah, amazing l can even walk.

1037
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,210
The disk.

1038
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,780
What, you think l'm stupid enough to let a gang of Chinese

1039
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,780
walk up the front steps and collect it from me in my living room?

1040
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,750
lt's in a safe, far away from here.

1041
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,490
l don't think you're stupid.

1042
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,390
Which is why l don't for a second you gave away the only copy.

1043
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,260
l'm going to meet Alex.

1044
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,190
First you're going to give me the disk.

1045
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,030
Or l'll put bullets in places that won't kill you.

1046
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,090
But it will make you spend the rest of your life wishing l had.

1047
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,540
Satisfied?

1048
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,700
l want to make sure it's not "ABBA's Greatest Hits" .

1049
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:52,350
Alex will kill you, you know?

1050
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,560
Yeah, probably.

1051
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,670
Jesus Luke, you look like Hell.

1052
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,400
Just alcohol,

1053
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,600
 lack of sunlight, sleep deprivation...

1054
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,640
...other than that l feel great.

1055
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,120
You know, l was thinking.

1056
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,250
How many bodies did we dump in this place?

1057
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,080
You know, l didn't keep count.

1058
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,490
They were all assholes though. Right?

1059
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,930
Let her go, Alex.

1060
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,030
Danny called,

1061
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,270
told me about your visit.

1062
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:22,200
l have to admit, even l didn't see that one coming.

1063
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,110
You have the disk and the money.

1064
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,940
What is she to you?

1065
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,050
Life.

1066
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:39,750
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

1067
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,130
Because she is the reason yours is going to be a whole lot shorter.

1068
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,230
Money, Luke.

1069
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,570
The Car.

1070
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,210
Or in a bank.

1071
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:59,180
Or in a series of lockers in Grand Central.

1072
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,680
Or maybe l donated it to charity.

1073
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,550
Out of the goodness of my heart.

1074
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,420
lf you want to find out where that money is,

1075
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,950
you are going to have to do it the hard way.

1076
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,680
Are you alright Mei?

1077
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,880
l saw him fight before.

1078
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,460
Bad business for you.

1079
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,820
Yeah, the worst.

1080
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,490
You saved me. Again.

1081
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,020
We save each other.

1082
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,170
l know how you feel.

1083
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:32,730
Help me get this sack of garbage out of the car.

1084
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,550
Make sure he gets to his daddy safe and sound.

1085
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:42,010
Fifty grand.

1086
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,250
For your trouble.

1087
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,360
l know it don't seem like much. But at least you're going to live to enjoy it.

1088
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,090
You want him safe and sound?

1089
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,150
After what he did to you?

1090
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,830
For her sake.

1091
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,100
We meet again, all bets are off.

1092
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,270
Most revered Uncle.

1093
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:08,840
Here is twenty nine million, nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

1094
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,020
We will pay back the remaining fifty thousand, with interest.

1095
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,220
But in case you are still angry,

1096
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,990
l must tell you this;

1097
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:21,520
l know every account of every operation you have in Chinatown...

1098
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,990
and the money routes back to China.

1099
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,250
You don't come after us, we won't come after you.

1100
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,500
Come after us... and your world ends.

1101
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,230
You have my word on that.

1102
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,840
Get me on a flight home.

1103
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,040
lf l never set foot in this damned city again...

1104
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,040
lt will be too soon.

1105
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:51,290
Watch where you are fucking going man!

1106
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:51,890
Keep walking, pal.

1107
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,360
Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?

1108
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,760
This is fucking New York City!

1109
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,710
Bank number five. How many more?

1110
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,100
That's it.

1111
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:14,980
There are copies of the disk in security boxes all over the city.

1112
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,250
Anything happens to us

1113
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,370
a lot of important people are going to be very sorry.

1114
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,050
Our security.

1115
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,640
Good business for us.

1116
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,910
What now?

1117
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,890
Now we get out of town.

1118
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,190
Mei, you're a kid and...

1119
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,060
l'm not sure l could be a good father.

1120
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,270
l think that ship has sailed.

1121
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,790
l don't want no more fathers.

1122
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,190
Will you be my friend?

1123
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,330
Until my dying day.

1124
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:54,480
l've got info on a school for gifted kids up in Seattle.

1125
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:57,180
lt's a nice drive,

1126
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,390
if you like trees and shit.

1127
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,720
Are we safe?

1128
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,820
One day at a time, Mei.

1129
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:09,050
One day at a time.
