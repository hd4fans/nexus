1
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,127
Monkey King, you bastard

2
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,662
You've promised Buddha

3
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,991
To help the Longevity Monk
to get scriptures in the west

4
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,596
But the King Bull and you decided to
eat your master

5
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,731
Do you know you've made a real big
mistake?

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,823
Shut up!

7
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,028
You've followed me for 3 days

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,332
l didn't beat you up because you're
a woman

9
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,189
Don't think that l'm afraid of you

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,890
Monkey King

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,859
be polite to Goddess!

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,189
Shut up

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,995
You scare me again

14
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,295
lf you're not scared of me

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,829
you needn't hurt Purple Fairy

16
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,957
and stole her Pandora's Box

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,132
You just wanna escape

18
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,923
Now, l can't escape

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,690
l will fight with you

20
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,258
What's up?

21
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,260
Don't be angry

22
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,455
You may violate the rule

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,529
Monkey King, you're so naughty!

24
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,699
l've told you

25
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,297
not to throw things!

26
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,060
Look!

27
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,424
You've thrown away the stick

28
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,859
Pandora's Box is the treasure

29
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,031
You'll pollute the environment

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,990
You'll hurt kids

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,223
lf there are no kids

32
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:01,490
it is bad to hurt plants

33
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,294
What's up?

34
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,692
Let go!

35
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,024
You want?

36
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,391
Speak up if you want!

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,498
Why do you keep silent?

38
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,221
Although your eyes are full of sincerity

39
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,399
l'm very glad, you still have to speak up

40
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,496
Do you really like?

41
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,096
Take it

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,664
Do you really like?

43
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,899
You

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,229
Damn!

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,065
Monkey King...

46
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,297
See

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,988
this guy keeps talking all the time

48
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,564
we don't know what he's talking about

49
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,357
He's just like a fly hanging around

50
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,559
Sorry, not a fly

51
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,027
lt's a swarm of flies flying near your ears

52
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,955
Flying into your brain

53
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,662
Help!

54
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,656
Help!

55
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,460
So l catch that fly. Open its belly

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,431
Take out its intestine

57
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,155
Put its intestine around its own neck

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,223
Then l pull the intestine tightly

59
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,559
The tongue comes out

60
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:11,789
l use a blade and cut!

61
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,423
Wow!

62
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,027
All the people keep silent

63
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:28,565
Now you know why l need to kill

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,630
Monkey King, you have so many excuses

65
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,957
You don't want to get scriptures
in the west

66
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,225
Shut up please! Beat!

67
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,194
l've got a super body. You can't hurt me

68
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,160
l don't scare of any god

69
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,930
l'm detroy all devils

70
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,598
Being master
l should take the responsibility

71
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,662
Please let him go!

72
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:18,855
l have to do so
l need to report to Heaven Emperor

73
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,725
Goddess, please tell Heaven Emperor

74
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,159
l can sacrifice my life for him

75
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,691
Namonitabhaya...

76
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,189
What did he said?

77
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,154
Give him the pork

78
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:55,929
Stand by!

79
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,257
A woman is coming in!

80
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,761
Asst. Master
do you think soldiers are coming?

81
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,828
This is why you're called Blind Bing

82
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,697
Didn't you see Dumby shaking his ass?

83
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,430
Do you think he has hemorrhoids?

84
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,163
OK, even if he has hemorrhoids

85
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,457
he is a soldier with hemorrhoids

86
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,689
So what to be feared about him?

87
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:40,859
Who the hell you are?

88
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:44,996
Don't you reckon l'm a woman?

89
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,758
What do you come here for?

90
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,790
The world's gone mad

91
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:53,828
A weary lady

92
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,192
looking for a shelter

93
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,329
l wanna brush off the dust of my past

94
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,923
Do you know what place it is?

95
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,692
This is not a nice place
You all look gruesome

96
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,225
l don't think it is a decent tavern

97
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,557
ls this a slaughter-house?

98
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,031
Yes, we are. How dare you come in

99
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,192
You're in danger already

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,332
l'm not sure who's in danger

101
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,396
l think you're in danger

102
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:26,028
You can be robbers

103
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,132
So can l

104
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,058
Who the hell you are?

105
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:44,828
Blossom

106
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,099
Nothing get into my way and survive

107
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,561
Money or your heads

108
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,756
Why does Ma'am 30th come to
Mt Wuyue?

109
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,959
This devil is a fierce robber

110
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:11,564
ls here having big business?

111
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,398
Why do you still

112
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,895
put the money on your head?

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,223
Put it back!

114
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,627
She said it is our head or the money
Master

115
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:22,763
What are you talking about?

116
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,028
Asst. Master!

117
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,691
You coward!
How can you be my assistant?

118
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,330
Master, l'm not Asst. Master!
l'm Blind Bing!

119
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:32,157
He is Asst. Master

120
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,490
l will make you regret!

121
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,562
l will make you regret!

122
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,127
Go away!

123
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:40,862
Look at yourself
Mousing around, so shameful

124
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:42,190
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

125
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,624
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

126
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:46,991
Master, l'm here!

127
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,365
Come out!

128
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:49,759
Coming

129
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,960
Master, you're hit by Kunlun Sage's
7 Ultimate Fists

130
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,597
Your wounds are spreading

131
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,887
Shut up

132
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,292
you knelt down that time

133
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,965
and l got hit in the nose

134
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,426
Master, here!

135
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,061
The 7 Ultimate Fists really hurt Master

136
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,697
Master, l was scared, so l knelt down

137
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,058
lt is heard that people who got hit by the
7 Ultimate Fists

138
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,322
will have disease in his eyes

139
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,260
Then he'll become dumb

140
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,658
After that he can't speak properly

141
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,421
At last, his body explodes and he's dead

142
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:15,757
Master, there's something wrong with
your eyes!

143
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:16,828
l am OK!

144
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,326
l only concentrate my eyesight on a
single point

145
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,555
l only change my usual way of vision

146
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,389
Do you want to take my position?

147
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:23,928
No, Master, l don't dare

148
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,663
You don't dare? l am gonna kill you!

149
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,266
Kill you!

150
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,725
Can you cry out for me?

151
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:31,991
Ah...

152
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,227
Ok, let's get our weapons and search

153
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,731
Ma'am 30th

154
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,623
No need to scare! l'm here!

155
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,358
l'm the leader of the Axe Gang

156
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,293
My nickname is Joker

157
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,055
lt is nice to meet famous Ma'am 30th

158
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,822
What are you gonna

159
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,559
do here?

160
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,728
l just wanna stay here for a while

161
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,525
A while? How long is it?

162
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:03,254
3 full days

163
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,094
Maybe 30 or 50 years

164
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,328
l'll leave when l meet the person

165
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:10,554
who l want to see

166
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,826
l don't think you can wait so long

167
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:18,987
What are you doing?

168
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,460
l've just had a piss!

169
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,456
You had a piss here?

170
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,393
This is why you have so much water
to bath

171
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,587
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,229
l said live to see that person

173
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:40,023
Master...

174
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,591
l'm not that easy to kill

175
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,694
Ask my brothers first

176
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,690
You have no guts...

177
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,294
You betray me!

178
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,589
God!

179
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,627
Kill us all if you can!

180
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,664
Forgive me...

181
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:29,762
Forgive me, heroine...

182
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,760
Stupid! Do you think she will let you go?

183
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,922
l'm gonna fight

184
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,290
even if l lost my life!

185
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,930
That's fine. Since you're willing to beg me

186
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,495
l won't kill you now

187
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,595
Thanks a lot!...

188
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,253
You...you're so righteous!

189
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,325
You're so good!

190
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:02,730
You all clean your sole and wait for me
outside

191
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:10,798
Why is there a scar?

192
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,655
This is not a scar, it is only dirt

193
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,524
Go clean it

194
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,856
or l'll cut the whole leg off

195
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:16,131
Master

196
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,695
why she wanna see our sole?

197
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,956
lt is lucky that you don't wanna see
our ass

198
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,159
Are you scared?

199
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,661
l'm not! You are scared!

200
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:23,591
Why?

201
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:24,855
You have hemorrhoids

202
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:25,757
She'll say they are not clean enough

203
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:26,827
and cut them off

204
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:27,963
Why do you know l have hemorrhoids?

205
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,961
Blind Bing peeped on your shower

206
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:31,863
Why did you peep on me?

207
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:33,198
l not only peeped on you

208
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:34,989
l've peeped on you all

209
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,922
Why is there so much hair?

210
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:40,826
Sure

211
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,794
l've got more in other parts

212
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:43,490
What?

213
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:44,754
Are you excited now?

214
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,124
Where did you say has more hair?

215
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,330
No

216
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,191
in fact l only have hair on my head and
sole

217
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,025
Do you think
they grow on the wrong places?

218
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,693
From now on, l'll check all the people

219
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,159
passing here!

220
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,328
Check what?

221
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,195
Check their sole

222
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,388
lf you discover a guy having
three birthmarks, tell me

223
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,028
Master! We don't go to rob

224
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,231
but check people's sole

225
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,488
lf the others know that
they'll say we're perverts

226
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,925
We can plot against her

227
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:23,894
Poison her, make her faint

228
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:24,864
then rape and kill her!

229
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,131
A good plot!

230
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,524
You think so

231
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,288
You shall administer the plan

232
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,291
l don't think l can do this

233
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,994
l go, no need to kneel down

234
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:37,062
l don't want to! l can't control my legs

235
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:38,993
Master, your wound is expanding

236
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,960
l still have both hands

237
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,829
l won't give up!

238
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,931
Master has fallen into a shit pit!

239
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,257
Master!

240
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,458
Have you found the three birthmarks?

241
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:38,794
Why does everyone tell me to find
the three birthmarks?

242
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:41,121
You can save him when you find them

243
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:42,394
What are you talking about?

244
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:43,426
Where are we?

245
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,123
Who?

246
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,089
Dreaming

247
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,852
Did you kill that bitch?

248
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,518
Spider! Spider...

249
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,619
lt's only a spider

250
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,855
lt's big

251
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,388
How big is it?

252
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,289
l've told you to tidy up the place

253
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,086
The spiders are bigger than me

254
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,258
What should l do?

255
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,984
lt keeps running after me

256
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,853
Maybe l'm handsome

257
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,382
What?

258
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:20,276
What's up?

259
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:20,855
A spider is running after Master?

260
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:21,956
This way? No...

261
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,095
This way!

262
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,859
Fine, be quick!

263
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:29,322
How come?

264
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,481

Help me!

269
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:51,957
Blind Bing!

270
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,754
Nothing in the front!
Turn back, turn back!

271
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,623
No! it's Master! Master...

272
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,319
lsn't it a cockroach?

273
00:17:57,364 --> 00:17:58,523
lt's Master

274
00:17:58,764 --> 00:17:59,695
Great! Go!

275
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,018
You sons of bitches, deceive me

276
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,828
Master, l'm coming

277

What am l touching?

278
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,323
Master is saved...

279
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,856
Asst. Master is so happy
What is he holding?

280
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:23,824
Master, didn't he carry you out?

281
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,587
l'm fine, let's go home...

282
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:29,896
Take a bath, go to bed sooner

283
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,118
Don't hang around tonight

284
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:33,586
Let go!

285
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:34,828
Spider!

286
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,825

Burn it!

290
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,590
Have a rest first

291
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,049
Burn it!

292
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,249
Don't let him go...burn it

293
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:05,783
Burn it!

294
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,946
No need to be frightened

295
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:08,517
Burn him...

296
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,111
He's there...

297
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:12,144
lt's over there, go there...

298

This one is smaller

300
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:26,642
Freeze!

301

There!

305
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,726
Only two claws are left
Let me break you in half

306
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,121
Go to hell

307
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:21,921
Don't go!

308
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,357
lt's here

309
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:33,258
Beat it!

310
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:37,792
Give it to me

311
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:45,398
All spread out! Let me burn it!

312
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,564
Go to hell!

313

Burning!

314
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,997
Very hot!

315
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,063
lt's Master's voice

316
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,526
Help!

317
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,429

318
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:00,427
lt's Master

319
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:01,925
Help!

320
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:05,390
Master, your cock is burning

321
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,996
Be quick

322
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,198
Get the water...

323
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,092
Put out the fire

324
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:10,195
Put out the fire

325
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:11,227
Dying!

326
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:12,362
Be quick

327
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,955
l'm going to out the fire, too

328
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,787
You can't put out the fire with straw
Stay away!

329
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:18,826
Master, it's OK!

330
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,655
l'll put it out!

331
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,761
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop burning...

332
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,097
Out you go...!

333
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,829
Stop burning!

334
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,896
l can't take this...

335
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:50,222
The fire is out! Are you OK?

336
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,722
You have to step on him and
put the fire out

337
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:56,259
Moron!

338
00:21:58,965 --> 00:21:59,953
Who burned me?

339
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,196
Not me!

340
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,023

341
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,228

342
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:07,857

343
00:22:08,098 --> 00:22:09,029
You wanna take my place!

344
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,028
No...Master...

345
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,288
Master's eyes are Ok

346
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,756
No, l didn't do that

347
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,295
Master, you've recovered

348
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,057
l'm cured! Why?

349
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,028
l know!

350
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:20,822
You must hurt yourself in order to

351
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:21,654
cure the wounds

352
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:23,820
lt's reasonable!

353
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,996
You have to thank Asst. Master

354
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,596
lf he didn't hit you at the crotch

355
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:29,195
you won't be healed so fast

356
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,331
Do you have an affair with him?

357
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:32,929
l love you so much

358
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:34,959
Go to hell! Stop it!

359
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:38,558
l've told you to kill Ma'am 30th

360
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:39,626
Have you done that?

361
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:40,762
Ma'am 30th is a devil!

362
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,721
Spider Woman!

363
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,894
l'm a rational man

364
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,326
l can't accept such ridiculous thing!

365
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:48,361
Kill her!

366
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,088
Master, aren't you scared?

367
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:51,854
Of course not! l'm healed

368
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:52,791
l will defeat her!

369
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,397
Great! You have guts!

370
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,188
You said l had guts?

371
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,796
Yes, but forget l'd say that

372
00:22:57,831 --> 00:22:58,728
Master

373
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:01,157
You just get into her room and
finish her off

374
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,590
We'll cover you up!

375
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:03,989
Why l go first everytime...

376
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,165
You said you would cover me up
so stay closer

377
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,296
Steady

378
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,226
we've got weapons

379
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,091
We'll throw them at her

380
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,858
You'll kill me, too

381
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,098
Don't be silly!

382
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,094
You won't die, you'll only get hurt!

383
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:34,590
Sons of bitches!

384
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:39,690
Get! You are not fooling me

385
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:40,795
Listen to me

386
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:43,031
Stop that

387
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,463
Fainted?

388
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:46,494
Big Cow, Younger Tiger

389
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:51,826
You're all useless. Let me do this

390
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,426
What?

391
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,921
You faked the fainted?

392
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:08,097
This is a tactic

393
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,024
lt is very useful

394
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,061
Where is the leak?

395
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:19,791
Asst. Master, you're bleeding

396
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,494
Don't scare!

397
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:24,697
l can stop the bleeding

398
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,057
by myself

399
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,188
it's not picturesque

400
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:46,762
but it is unique

401
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,090
You may love this place, eventually

402
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,287
Good night!

403
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,789
Master...

404
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:57,964
She is a devil!

405
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,055
Yes!

406
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,864
She is a real devil!

407
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,962
My heart is pounding!

408
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:06,529
Master, stop it!

409
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:14,328
You're a righteous man, a hero

410
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,929
lt is my pleasure

411
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,528
to be your friend

412
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:19,357
The money put on your bros' heads

413
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,189
is all given to you to buy drinks

414
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,756
Thank you very much, Ma'am 30th

415
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,995
Master, she's not really good-looking

416
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:29,895
But l like her!

417
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,889
Only thrust the thigh once
but there're so many holes

418
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:39,256
What do you mean?

419
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:52,397
Sister, why did you leave?

420
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,029
You ran to this poor village

421
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:54,992
and you're forced to reveal

422
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:57,457
your real image

423
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,628
What are you doing here?

424
00:25:58,798 --> 00:25:59,786
How about you?

425
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:01,661
l just want to have a walk

426
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:04,926
You're waiting for the Longevity Monk

427
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,097
you wanna eat his flesh

428
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:08,228
You can make Granpa Buddha

429
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:09,821
speak out this top secret

430
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:11,223
So do l

431
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:12,464
Nonsense!

432
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:15,460
Nonsense?
Why did you come to Mt Wuyue?

433
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,029
This was called Fingers Mountain
in the past

434
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:19,459
lt's the prison for this monkey

435
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,291
The top secret says that
he'll become human

436
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,930
and he has three birthmarks on his sole

437
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,760
you can find the Monk
if you know where Monkey King is

438
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,898
Sister, do you still think
l'm speaking nonsense?

439
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,495
You just want to see that monkey

440
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:35,826
You can do nothing even if you see him

441
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,691
The difference is that
he died in Goddess's hands last time

442
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,596
but he died in my hands this time

443
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:43,427
lt will benefit

444
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:44,926
only one person

445
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,797
You know the reason!

446
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:49,223
Do you wanna fight over him with me?

447
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,925
Do you think only you can fake face?

448
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:58,791
Who?

449
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,560
Devil...!

450
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:21,692
What did you see?

451
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,556
Nothing

452
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:23,458
No!

453
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:24,754
What are you doing down there?

454
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:26,155
l wanna tie the lace

455
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:37,795
lf the secret of the monk leaked

456
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:39,157
l'll kill you

457
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:42,525
Then, all devils gather at Fingers Mountain

458
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,663
beg for the flesh of the Longevity Monk

459
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,655
Tell the King about this

460
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,591
he will bestow on us

461
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:57,620
Even a bull is talking
So many devils here this time

462
00:27:57,865 --> 00:27:59,262
Go...go away

463
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:01,854
lf l go now, l'm a coward!

464
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:03,955
No, report to Master

465
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,528
Master

466
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,263
This mountain was called

467
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:09,462
Fingers Mountain in the past

468
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:11,687
The Longevity Monk and the
Monkey King will meet here

469
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:14,191
My bull is talking

470
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,090
Those two things

471
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:18,026
one has 8 legs, one's head...

472
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,023
You two haven't slept?

473
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,060
What are you talking about?

474
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:26,964
ah...

475
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:29,255
Two baby pigs are born

476
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:32,294
One has 8 legs

477
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,497
One has a very heavy head

478
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:36,096
Master, we're rich now

479
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:37,830
We needn't to be robbers anymore...

480
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:38,893
We didn't rear any pigs

481
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:40,221
We didn't rear any pigs?

482
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:42,622
Or l'm speaking in my dream !

483
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:45,024
Ok, l'm leaving, please take a rest

484
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:46,158
We're leaving

485
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:47,523
Walk both girls away

486
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,628
No!

487
00:28:49,032 --> 00:28:51,190
l will order someone to search for

488
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:53,363
the guy you wanna see

489
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,924
Thank you master

490
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:58,097
Good night! Go!

491
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:00,889
Go! Go!

492
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:05,657
Nothing can be done this time

493
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,659
Why does Jing Jing have no reaction

494
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,396
to this image?

495
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:11,361
Nothing l can do

496
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:17,323
Go!

497
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,956
Don't kill me!...Don't kill me!

498
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,662
l just wanna have fun with you

499
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:34,358
Do you like playing?

500
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:35,524
Come and have fun

501
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:40,664
ls it funny?

502
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:41,592
Yes!

503
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:42,831
Ok, let's play again

504
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:52,387
Play again?

505
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:54,630
l don't wanna play...

506
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:56,329
You said who's got eight claws?

507
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:57,830
l can't remember it...

508
00:29:58,364 --> 00:29:59,352
What?

509
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:02,930
No!

510
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:05,657
My head looks like this?

511
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:07,688
Yes...! Oh no!

512
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:10,722
She's not changed yet

513
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:15,893
Not yet?

514
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:19,728
l'll kill him

515
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:20,556
No

516
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:22,822
Why?

517
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,228
l'm gonna mesmerize him

518
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:27,896
he'll be my undercover agent

519
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:32,853
Hi !

520
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,488
Ghost!

521
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:36,455
Go to have a look

522
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:39,490
You said a ghost!

523
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:41,095
Oh dear!

524
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,492
Don't be pretentious around here

525
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:47,722
Or l will cut you into pieces

526
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:49,523
You're so brutal!

527
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:50,721
Look at me!

528
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,830
Mesmerizing!

529
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:02,252
Who?

530
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:05,256
lt's a long night, no mood to sleep

531
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,555
l thought l am the only one

532
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,754
But Jing Jing, you're sleepless, too?

533
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:17,295
Yes, why can't you sleep?

534
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:20,253
Just because of Jing Jing!

535
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,691
Me?

536
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,629
yes, when l saw you

537
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:27,490
l made up my mind that
l wouldn't be a robber

538
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:30,322
l just wanna show my sincerity

539
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:32,827
l can't face my past

540
00:31:33,198 --> 00:31:34,255
Like what you see?

541
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:37,093
You're monkey?

542
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,662
Monkey?

543
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:39,759
Monkey King

544
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:41,028
Monkey King?

545
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,095
You think you're alright with a
human face?

546
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:43,252
Human Face?

547
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:45,657
l have to use Skeleton Fire on you

548
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:49,326
You gonna burn me again!

549
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:51,086
Why?

550
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:52,722
Did l make a mistake?

551
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,088
Why?

552
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:59,321
Why did you use flame bomb to burn me?

553
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:00,827
Why did you shave off your beard?

554
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:02,228
You're just another guy

555
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:03,088
without the beard

556
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:04,195
Really?

557
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,927
You can't do anything

558
00:32:06,264 --> 00:32:08,355
Do you want to be a scholar instead of
a robber?

559
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:09,924
l've thought about this

560
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:11,722
Please stop changing image

561
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,898
being a robber is

562
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:15,027
a good job

563
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:16,527
l know

564
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,663
l'll try my best!

565
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:20,490
You look like that thing!

566
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,197
So pathetic

567
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:26,889
Jing Jing loves my violent side

568
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:35,886
Having the personality again

569
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,622
Monkey King, come out!

570
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:56,858
Damn monkey

571
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:59,120
You said you would marry me
when l was 1 8

572
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:00,388
l have waited for you 3 years

573
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:01,655
You come out!

574
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,060
Our King is not here

575
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:07,025
He said give it Miss Pak
when you come here

576
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:09,060
and thanked Miss Pak very much

577
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,127
He can't enjoy it

578
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,689
500 years...

579
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:25,420
We've found the Longevity Monk at last

580
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,330
The hair on the sole has shaved off

581
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:37,087
l don't know when it will grow again

582
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:49,294
Shit! They come first!

583
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:52,028
l have to inform

584
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,728
these innocent people

585
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:18,759
You come back to Waterfall Cave again?

586
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:19,987
Waterfall Cave?

587
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:21,093
Who are you?

588
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:22,728
Why do you bring me here?

589
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:27,129
No one brings you here
You come here on your own

590
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,052
it is normal to miss your home

591
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:32,852
Don't tease me!

592
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:36,029
My home is at Mt Wuyue

593
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:37,492
You have made a mistake
can you hear me?

594
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:40,595
Don't annoy me, please!

595
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,888
We have to go, Master, or we'll be late

596
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:46,722
Go? What do you wanna do?

597
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,124
Robbery!

598
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:49,024
Who dare to do so?

599
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,389
We go to rob!

600
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:51,893
Ok, that's fine!

601
00:34:56,097 --> 00:35:01,496
Go to rob...

602
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,059
What?

603
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:05,195
Rob the sole

604
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:06,795
l have no legs. What to do?

605
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:14,090
What are you looking at?

606
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,489
Are you jealous of my handsomely
shaved face?

607
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,057
That's fine

608
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:19,287
Yes...

609
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:20,622
Jealous! You guys...

610
00:35:20,897 --> 00:35:22,022
Shut up!

611
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:26,286
Grapes?

612
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,721
Master, the grapes are washed

613
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,287
Go out

614
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:35,086
The dinner is ready

615
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:36,188
Go out!

616
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,821
Who?

617
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:46,359
l'm the grapes that you bring here!

618
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:48,022
You're grapes?

619
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:51,324
No, l'm Grandma Ada?

620
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:52,921
What Grandma Ada?

621
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:54,919
Stop the non-sense

622
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:56,754
l'm Grandpa Buddha, an immortal

623
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:58,692
l turned myself into grapes and save you

624
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:02,793
You stole my grapes and forbid me
mentioning Grandma

625
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,895
Both women are devils

626
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,489
lf you don't believe me

627
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,923
you can use my Magic Mirror!

628
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:10,494
l use your Mom's mirror!

629
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:11,492
Say! Listen to me

630
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,526
Have you stolen my grapes?

631
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:13,628
No!

632
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,262
Where are my grapes!

633
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,054
l'm your grapes!

634
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:17,321
Louder!

635
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:18,994
l'm your grapes

636
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,128
Why aren't you an apple?

637
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:23,623
Listen to me

638
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:25,257
You shouldn't think l can't defeat you

639
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:27,087
l don't wanna hurt innocent people

640
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:28,297
Go out!

641
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,826
You will be seriously hurt!

642
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:33,589
Jing Jing!

643
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:34,727
Your beard looks great!

644
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,022
Really?

645
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:37,793
Why was it so noisy?

646
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,162
Just beating the grapes

647
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:44,889
Who're gonna beat grapes?

648
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:47,053
Meal time

649
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,057
Meal time

650
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:49,989
That's great!

651
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:50,957
Great?

652
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:53,390
What a pretty moon. Let'...

653
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:57,020
Moon? l can't see it

654
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,991
There is a big moon. Can you see it?

655
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:02,355
lt's not dark yet
how come is there a moon?

656
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:03,655
Tell me...

657
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:10,261
Who? Who the hell...!

658
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,589
Who the hell?

659
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,626
l was turned into grapes

660
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,491
Where are you?

661
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:14,754
ln your trousers

662
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,160
Big grapes!

663
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:19,227
lt's yours. l'm at your back!

664
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:21,461
That's great to see you

665
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,355
You trust me now!

666
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:23,757
Yes, l trust you

667
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:26,496
Why do we have devil here?

668
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,094
Stupid fool, listen to me

669
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:34,287
These devils are waiting for the
Longevity Monk

670
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:36,225
Longevity Monk?

671
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:41,928
500 years ago
Monkey King was destroyed by Goddess

672
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,891
His master Longevity Monk wanted to
save him

673
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:45,027
He exchanged the monkey's life

674
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:47,695
with his own

675
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,897
He hoped this monkey would be good

676
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,621
Why does the Longevity Monk

677
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:52,885
need to appear?

678
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:57,226
he wanted to save the whole world

679
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:59,862
so he went to lndia and tried to get
scriptures

680
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:02,428
he hoped they would do good to
the people

681
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,721
All devils were impressed by his spirit

682
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,554
heaven Emperor saw that

683
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:09,753
He gave the monkey a chance to revive

684
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,896
He planned the master and the disciple
to meet here

685
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,495
Then they can finish the journey
to the west

686
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:17,127
Now, you know why there are so many
devils here

687
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,596
You got it

688
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,691
So l am having the same

689
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,991
dream

690
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:27,527
ln a pitch-dark area

691
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,253
a pair of seductive eyes

692
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:31,996
looking at me

693
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:34,421
make me embarrassed

694
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:35,754
Your eyes look like the eyes in my dream

695
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,963
Sometimes, my face becomes red

696
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,130
l have to face the devils tonight!

697
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,058
Yes! You are facing devils tonight!

698
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:45,287
Two Magic Bags here
and some invisible stickers

699
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,655
You're invisible if you stick one on
your body

700
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:50,092
Cover him by it when he is not aware

This is my line!

703
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,429
Whom are you talking to?

704
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:56,754
To him

705
00:38:57,797 --> 00:39:00,991
Let me help you!

706
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:03,159
That's great! You're my good bro

707
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:04,693
Tell all bros to come in

00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,695
Then we can catch all the devils

711
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,696
No problem

712
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:10,863
Good brother

713
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:14,791
Your eyes today...

714
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,591
Are they seductive?

715
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,687
Yes

716
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,754

lt is Master's order

720
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:44,419
You wait a moment

721
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:45,730
Asst. Master

722
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,394
Tell the others, Master is looking for us

723
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:51,419

Let's keep quiet and see what they want

729
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,221
Sister, drink!

730
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,053
Sister, you drink too

731
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:48,787

734
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:57,289
You shouldn't drink so much if you
cannot drink

735
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,062
We're invisible

736
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:20,486
You can see nothing all the time

737
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,593
Ok!

738
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:27,754
Master hasn't come yet

739
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:28,928
Yes

740
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:30,357
You say there is roast chicken

741
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,629
Master! lt's burning

742
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,818
Don't be naked

743

Pay me back! Fool!

744
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,789
No need to be like that?

745
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:39,587
None of your business, pay me back

746
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:40,626
When did l borrow money from you

747
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:41,591
You owe me

748

No...

You lost your memory

752
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,857

757
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:19,490
Really? Yes, yes

758
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,156
You're old. You lost your memory

759
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,056
Forget it, it's my fault

760
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,127
Cut it! Cut it!

761
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,700
That's better than nothing

762
00:43:31,936 --> 00:43:32,993
Fight with him! Bros!

763
00:43:33,336 --> 00:43:34,098
Bros, let's go!

764
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:35,262
Yes!

765
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:40,129
Devils, come out!

766
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:44,333
Where is the Magic Bag?

767
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:48,290
The Magic Bag is here
They wanna frame you

768
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,466
Traitor, you betray me

769
00:43:54,836 --> 00:43:56,495
Today, you betray me

770

l will betray you one day

771

l can take off my underwear!

775
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,161
Master, there's really something wrong
with Asst. Master

776
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:17,325
That guy is unwilling to do anything
even if l beg him

777
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:19,432
Now, he admit so quickly
There must be something wrong

778
00:44:19,669 --> 00:44:20,327
Pull him out

779
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,665
Yes!

780
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:24,534

Kneel down

785

You son of a bitch
l'm gonna kill you tonight

786
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:36,667
Fine!

787
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:38,565
You can't blame him

788
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:41,529
He's only mesmerized by both devils

789
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:43,663
Let me go

790
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,061
or l'll tell my Master to kill you

791
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:46,796
Shut up!

792
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:50,233
Wong Choi

793
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,235
The string you're biting is so familiar

794
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:53,963
Stranger

795
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:56,532
lt is the string for my Magic Bag

796
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:00,600
Son of a bitch

797
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:03,529
How dare you come here!

798
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:06,469
Come here!

799
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,759
l'll kill you, reincarnated Monkey King

800
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,129
Then you won't find the Longevity Monk

801
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:12,231
What?

802
00:45:12,736 --> 00:45:13,724
He is the Monkey King?

803
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:16,429
Say you're the Monkey King

804
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:18,225
or we'll all die

805
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:19,424
He's not the Monkey King

806
00:45:19,669 --> 00:45:20,965
He can't even withstand my Skeleton Fire

807
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,136
He is not the Monkey King ?

808
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:23,434
Shit!

809
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:24,999
You've exposed a top secret

810
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:25,964
Really?

811
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,332
This way

812
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:29,224
Are you really a fairy?

813
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:30,560
Give me your hand

814
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,865
lt is too much of you...

815
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:35,297
Do you think l can't withstand your
Skeleton Fire?

816
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:37,002
Burn me again

817
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:37,928
Serious?

818
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:39,367
Great!

819
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,193
l'm not scared! See?

820
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:45,867
Yes!

821
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:52,894
You can burn my hand if you like

822
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:55,426
l'm not afraid of you

823
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:58,367
Not burn my hand?

824
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:06,528
Burning

825
00:46:10,136 --> 00:46:11,830
The hand is still OK

826
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:14,593
Let go!

827
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:16,758
Now you know l'm great

828
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:17,832

829
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,968
l have got my bros and a fairy

830
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:21,099
Where are you going?

831
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:22,892
l'll take revenge on you one day

832
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:24,735
Even a fairy is not righteous

833
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:25,696
No need to ask

834
00:46:25,903 --> 00:46:27,835
My bros must be there

835
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:29,758
Yes! Master!

836
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:32,799
Sons of bitches!

837
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:35,001
Are you that heartless guy?

838
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:36,566
You deceived me last night!

839
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,130
That Monkey King

840
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,264
Sister will not be married just
because of you

841
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:42,533
Me?

842
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:45,959
Get the Joker!

843
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,124
Go!

844
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:48,302
Stop that

845
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:50,125
Master, go

846
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,202
Don't kill my bros!

847
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:24,661
Master

848
00:47:31,436 --> 00:47:32,993
Blindy, l'm here, no need to scare

849
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:37,196
Sorry, Blindy!

850
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:38,333
You have made a mistake

851
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:39,897
You won't blame me, will you?

852
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:43,191
For my whole life l know

853
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:45,093
l'm blind...

854
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,027
But l am right to be your follower!

855
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,130
Kill you!

856
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,157
You go to hell

857
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:01,334
You can't kill him

858
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:02,399
You still help him

859
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:03,431
You want to rely on him to find
the Longevity Monk

860
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:05,290
Take him back to Spider's Web Cave

861
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,526
Sister

862
00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:14,632
Only one man can be benefit by it

863
00:48:14,903 --> 00:48:16,664
You don't know this in fact

864
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,258
You won't gian anything even
if you hurt me

865
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:20,594
Look at your palm

866
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:23,359
Black Widow!

867
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,730
You've been poisoned by my weapon

868
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,435
You will die in 7 days

869
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,294
if you can't get my remedy

870
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:32,858
Sister, l don't dare to do so anymore

871
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:34,100
Get lost!

872
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,801
You regret at last

873
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,332
No! A fierce thing has come

874
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:45,099
Go out and have a look

875
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:48,066
Where are you going?

876
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:49,495
No!...

877
00:48:53,636 --> 00:48:54,158
King Bull has come?

878
00:48:54,202 --> 00:48:55,463
King Bull?

879
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:05,959
Pretend to be dead here?

880
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:06,793

Granpa Buddha

883
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,893
Give the Longevity Monk to me

884
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:25,999
or you're gonna die

885
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:26,963
We have nothing to talk

886
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:28,500
You are looking for the Monkey King

887
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,998
My bro Monkey King?

888
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:32,494
Where is he?

889
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:34,566
This monster

890
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,994
is the Monkey King's Bro

891
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,292

Another hundred years before it is healed

920
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,497
Get up

921
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:23,125
What are you doing?

922
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:26,931
Master wanna see you

923
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:28,994

Spider Web Cave

925
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,094
Spider Web Cave?

926
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:34,199
Yes!

927

This is Spider Web Cave

929
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:40,932
Spider Web Cave?

930
00:52:41,302 --> 00:52:42,495
Let's go! Monkey

931
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:43,758
Hey, you have gone mad

932

933
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:46,931
l'm mad

934
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:48,295
You are lying!

935
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:49,694
You've admitted that

936
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:50,832
you're the Monkey King

937
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:51,660
Go!

938
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:52,594
Get smart just for once

939
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:53,858
l was forced to pretend

940
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,297
you can use the Magic Mirror to
show my true identity

941
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:58,093
Magic Mirror?

942
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:07,730
Can you see it?

943
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:08,832
Yes

944
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:10,124
Clear?

945
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:12,694
Deceive me!

946
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:14,697
This is not the Magic Mirror

947
00:53:15,669 --> 00:53:17,658
Pig!

948
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:20,534
Sister, have pity on me

949
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:22,494
Stay calm

950
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:25,331
l guarantee that you can trust

951
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:26,727

952
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:27,827
Master!

953
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:28,794
Master!

954
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,626
Master! The monkey has come

955
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:34,429
Where is the Longevity Monk?

956
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:38,693
Big misunderstanding, everybody

957
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:40,058
How big?

958
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:41,335
Let me tell you secretly

959
00:53:41,669 --> 00:53:43,601
l was born in the Year of Monkey
but l'm not the Monkey King

960
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:44,560
A waste of time!

961
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:45,426
l have got the Magic Mirror and
everything

962
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:46,430
You can use the mirror on me

963
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:47,464
Fake mirror

964
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:48,361
how dare you use the fake mirror...

965
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:49,898
Now! Stop playing game

966
00:53:50,636 --> 00:53:51,896
lf l'm the Monkey King

967
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:53,294
why am l standing here for you to bite
my hand?

968
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:54,296
l could jump to the sky

969
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:56,627
Then shit on your heads

970
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:57,766
You haven't changed to be
Monkey King yet

971
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,660
You'll shit at that time

972
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,698
What is it, sister?

973
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:03,793
Broken hearted?

974
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:05,196
No

975
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:06,594
No?

976
00:54:08,302 --> 00:54:10,665
l won't be hurt by this man again

977
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,293
you are lying to me!

978
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:16,234
Sister, l'm not lying to you

979
00:54:17,035 --> 00:54:19,194
Then kill him

980
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:20,929
Kill him

981
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,158
Don't you want to find
the Longevity Monk?

982
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:26,495
Yes! But l don't think you will kill him

983
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,798
Not accurate...

984
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:35,126
Give the sword!

985
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:39,031
Give! Understand

986
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:42,632
Kill him!

987
00:54:43,302 --> 00:54:44,427
You've sliced a piece of my thigh out

988
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:45,396
l intended to do that

989
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:46,726
Give me a bill and l'll pay you back

990
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:47,764
You're welcome

991
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:49,361
l kill you!

992
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,758
Cheap whore, you still love that monkey

993
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:57,492
Stop that, l'm gonna kill you

994
00:55:13,536 --> 00:55:14,592
Are you Ok?

995
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:22,366
You're still concerned about me

996
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:26,030
l'm gonna love forever onwards

997
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:33,228
They are outside

998
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:34,527
Can this door block them?

999
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,962
this door is mad of unbreakable steel

1000
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:41,359
Stand aside

1001
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,228
Sister, do you remember
how he treated you in the past?

1002
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:49,564
He deceived you, refused to marry you

1003
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,563
You had a good marriage with
Chilian lmmortal

1004
00:55:51,802 --> 00:55:52,768
He ruined it

1005
00:55:53,035 --> 00:55:53,932
He can do nothing now

1006
00:55:54,136 --> 00:55:54,931
When he returned to his own image

1007
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:56,099
he'll leave you

1008
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:57,324
Have you finished? Son of bitch!

1009
00:55:57,635 --> 00:55:59,158
Damn monkey
how dare you call me a bitch!

1010
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:00,696
Scold me, son of a bitch

1011
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,234
Don't think it's safe to hide inside

1012
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:04,901
it's full moon tonight

1013
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:06,634
She will become a zombie!

1014
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:12,097
l don't scare, son of a bitch

1015
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:19,901
What?

1016
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,724
There are many hills and caves here

1017
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:24,559
We don't know
where the Spider Web Cave is?

1018
00:56:24,602 --> 00:56:25,932
Yes...

1019
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:29,795
More than the bugs in my body. Search!

1020
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:02,797
What are you doing?

1021
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:05,758
How about inside? Are you fine?

1022
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,399
Of course l'm alright

1023
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:09,067
We are very happy

1024
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:12,663
Jing Jing is till very pretty

1025
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:14,492
l'm still very handsome

1026
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:15,929
We are still very good-looking

1027
00:57:16,202 --> 00:57:17,497
Meal time, Ma'am 30th

1028
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:23,627
Help...

1029
00:57:24,202 --> 00:57:25,259
Zombie!

1030
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:26,094
Open the door!

1031
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:26,857
l can't open it!

1032
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:28,168
Kiss her, breath life to her

1033
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:30,496
Maybe it will be stopped

1034
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:33,827
Scare me!

1035
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:37,201
Sister, you can't defeat me

1036
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:38,300
Really?

1037
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,428
l'll break you neck if you move

1038
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:45,034
Give me the key! Lock him up

1039
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:47,896
You wanna go inside

1040
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:48,866
Now you can go

1041
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,597
Goodbye!

1042
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:09,492
Please stop taking revenge

1043
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,125
Listen to my suggestions

1044
00:58:15,102 --> 00:58:16,931
You can beat me
but please don't hit my face...

1045
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:23,091
Stop beat my cock, thanks

1046
00:58:23,468 --> 00:58:25,094
There is a chicken, Ma'am 30th

1047
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,290
l'm telling you

1048
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:42,901
No reactions after a kiss

1049
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:44,032
Don't lock it up

1050
00:58:47,336 --> 00:58:49,268
Ok, since you refuse to open the door

1051
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:50,727
l warn you

1052
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:54,001
l'll rape and kill your lover

1053
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:58,931
One

1054
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:09,998
Two

1055
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:14,699
l get it

1056
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:20,267
Three

1057
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:26,031
Seductive magic

1058
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:36,591
Go!

1059
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:46,125
What are you doing?

1060
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:48,359
l have just shivered for a while

1061
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:50,362
Very interesting

1062
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,191
You shivered on my body?

1063
00:59:52,902 --> 00:59:53,925
Yes

1064
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,798
Oh god!

1065
01:00:20,136 --> 01:00:22,328
lt must be better if she's not a devil!

1066
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,425
You're poisoned

1067
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:36,867
You'll die if you don't cured

1068
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:38,493
What for even if l'm cured?

1069
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,533
Living long is meaningless
if you are unhappy

1070
01:00:41,902 --> 01:00:45,527
Your last few days will be great
if you're happy

1071
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:48,599
lf l tell you l'm the Monkey King

1072
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:49,823
what do you think?

1073
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:51,660
l will kill you

1074
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:53,899
l'm not him

1075
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:55,793
This is a magic mirror

1076
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:56,797
You should use it

1077
01:00:57,202 --> 01:00:58,633
You're not him, really?

1078
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:00,492
l'm not

1079
01:01:01,035 --> 01:01:02,557
Don't you scare that l will kill you?

1080
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:05,500
Yes, but l have no option

1081
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:08,960
Because l don't want you to look at me

1082
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:11,928
while you're thinking of another

1083
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:15,892
l would like to kill you

1084
01:01:16,735 --> 01:01:19,031
You said living long was meaningless

1085
01:01:19,268 --> 01:01:20,734
if you were unhappy

1086
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:13,698
Go ahead!

1087
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:15,061
Yes, l'll

1088
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:28,131
Shit! Who make this knot?

1089
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:29,459
Let me do it!

1090
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:41,334
Sorry, l don't mean it

1091
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:43,026
You do it strongly

1092
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:44,662
So l wanna do it with you

1093
01:02:45,135 --> 01:02:46,499
Although l'm not a righteous man

1094
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:47,963
l won't take advantages from the others

1095
01:02:49,168 --> 01:02:50,327
l'm not used to do it at daytime

1096
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,667
Let's wait till night

1097
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,459
No matter when

1098
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:03,731
call me if you need me

1099
01:03:04,735 --> 01:03:05,826
From now on

1100
01:03:06,168 --> 01:03:07,794
l'll be with you

1101
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:19,960
Can you get him?

1102
01:03:20,002 --> 01:03:20,626
No

1103
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:21,964
Go on

1104
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:46,963
Damn!

1105
01:03:47,402 --> 01:03:49,834
l'm so pretty

1106
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:52,864
But l have a baby with such an ugly man

1107
01:03:58,635 --> 01:03:59,623
Ma'am 30th

1108
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,961
Shut up!

1109
01:04:01,668 --> 01:04:03,793
l will kill you if l'm not pregnant

1110
01:04:05,235 --> 01:04:05,929
Thanks

1111
01:04:06,168 --> 01:04:07,327
Why are you so happy?

1112
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:09,664
Tell you...

1113
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:10,458
Don't tell the baby

1114
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:12,997
you're his father

1115
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,325
What should l be?

1116
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:16,729
His maiden

1117
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,491
l'm a man. l can't be a maiden!

1118
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:20,359
We bring him up

1119
01:04:20,602 --> 01:04:22,761
He don't know if a maiden is
a man or woman

1120
01:04:23,602 --> 01:04:24,659
That's right

1121
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:30,257
l've found a guy just like you

1122
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:43,191
lt's you?

1123
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:48,495
Do you wanna know
where the Longevity Monk is?

1124
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:52,022
Yes, l do

1125
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:54,133
Don't strike back if you do

1126
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,462
you have to pay for the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

1127
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:01,725
lt worths!

1128
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,226
lf you give me the medication for
Jing Jing

1129
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:07,832
l will tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

1130
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,391
You just do it for that bitch

1131
01:05:11,635 --> 01:05:13,760
l like to do so

1132
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,157
Maiden

1133
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,827
Maiden is kissing you

1134
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:35,126
Ok, let's go by tomorrow

1135
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:43,401
Because of love

1136
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:49,657
you can ruin my face if you like

1137
01:05:55,135 --> 01:05:56,624
Hurry up, do you wanna save someone?

1138
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:57,959
Just let me do it!

1139
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:09,498
Joker

1140
01:06:09,735 --> 01:06:11,291
Sister can't take this anymore
You go ahead!

1141
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,694
Let me...do that

1142
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:25,493
Not here

1143
01:06:31,968 --> 01:06:33,628
Everyone deceives me

1144
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,996
We'll reach the Buddha Cave after
climbing this hill

1145
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:45,500
No, Ah!

1146
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,966
Jing Jing!

1147
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:51,363
Jing Jing!

1148
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:58,897
She thought l left her alone

1149
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:00,568
How long will you search?

1150
01:07:00,802 --> 01:07:02,028
Jing Jing

1151
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:03,960
She's poisoned, must have died and
fell down from the cliff

1152
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:08,695
lt's all because of you

1153
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,229
You shouldn't let me sleep for
a whole night

1154
01:07:10,268 --> 01:07:11,097
l should come here as soon as possible

1155
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:12,197
You should whip the horse strongly

1156
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,132
We can be faster!

1157
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:14,492
l won't tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

1158
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:15,660
l don't know anything

1159
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:18,524
How dare you put the blame on me!

1160
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:22,463
What?

1161
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:25,429
We discovered that Boney M fainted
under the cliff

1162
01:07:25,635 --> 01:07:27,260
Granpa Buddha has died

1163
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:30,733
God is helping me!

1164
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:34,058
Go in!

1165
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:36,665
lf you don't tell me

1166
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:38,025
you can't go out

1167
01:07:41,402 --> 01:07:42,333
l won't listen to you

1168
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:51,165
The ground is not so hard

1169
01:07:54,402 --> 01:07:57,129
Powerful devil, extraordinary energy!

1170
01:07:58,702 --> 01:07:59,690
l will cure your wound but

1171
01:07:59,968 --> 01:08:02,491
you must take me to the Cave to get
the incarnated monkey

1172
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:03,859
We'll find the Longevity Monk sooner
or later

1173
01:08:04,101 --> 01:08:06,158
You can also eat the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

1174
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:08,798
or you will die painfully

1175
01:08:14,068 --> 01:08:15,694
l have to come out
even if l have to dig a tunnel

1176
01:08:20,135 --> 01:08:22,965
l can move freely in time and space with
the power of moon

1177
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:27,928
What is it?

1178
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:48,060
This is the lndian language

1179
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,733
The Pandora's Box

1180
01:08:54,168 --> 01:08:56,134
The treasure left behind by
Spider Web Devil?

1181
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:27,364
Take me into the Cave

1182
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:32,062
Why does the belly feel painful?

1183
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,267
ls it coming?

1184
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:35,629
Where am l?

1185
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:36,630
Why so many traps?

1186
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:37,958
lt becomes wetter and wetter

1187
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:20,198
Welcome, our King!

1188
01:10:31,568 --> 01:10:33,033
Damn! l've met a ghost!

1189
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:37,062
What's going on?

1190
01:10:37,768 --> 01:10:38,756
You love the Longevity Monk

1191
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,727
so l play him to make you happy

1192
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:41,593
What are you doing?

1193
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,026
l'm helping you to give birth!

1194
01:10:43,968 --> 01:10:45,127
The head is coming out!

1195

So there is no hair

1199

Monkey King
you'd committed serious offences

1206
01:11:20,268 --> 01:11:23,564
l hope you know you're wrong

1207
01:11:23,768 --> 01:11:24,791
Who's talking?

1208
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:28,597
500 years ago
your master Longevity Monk sacrificed

1209
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:29,993
his life to save you

1210
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:31,698
Heaven Emperor planned that

1212

Making sacrifices to save the others

1214
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:39,692
To clean the sin that you've made before

1215
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:42,160
You should put on the Gold Ring
on your head

1216
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:43,594
Admit you sin

1217
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:46,732
Then you'll become
the super Monkey King

1218
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:49,999
You'll take the responsibility to get
scriptures in the west

1219
01:11:50,301 --> 01:11:51,358
Rewrite the history

01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:01,591
You haven't turned into the Monkey King

1224
01:12:01,868 --> 01:12:03,095
because you haven't met the guy

1225
01:12:03,135 --> 01:12:04,998
who gives you the 3 birthmarks

1226
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:06,495

The baby looks like you

l think

1247
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:11,497
being an immortal or not is not important

1248
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:14,398
The flesh of the Longevity Monk
isn't must, too

1249
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:17,932
We have to live together happily

You want the Longevity Monk most

01:13:24,435 --> 01:13:26,525
Just call him Longevity

1254

Who?

1255
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:31,463
lt is too coincident

1256
01:13:31,901 --> 01:13:32,867

No need to scare, l'm gonna protect you

1267
01:14:11,734 --> 01:14:12,495
Who the hell you are?

1268
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:13,598
You're not qualified to protect me

1269
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:14,931
