4
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,658
显然 我错误估算了一些事情
Obviously, I miscalculated a few things.

5
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:08,664
艾迪 我知道你就在里面
Eddie! I know you're in there!

6
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:17,861
如果某天 生活远远脱离了正常的梦想...
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...

7
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,497
你输入的密码...
The access code you have entered...

8
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,870
而问题又如芒在刺
The knife appears at your back?

9
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,238
你输入的密码有误...
The access code you have entered is invalid...

10
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,742
好吧 听我说...
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

11
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:53,316
我绝不会让他们碰我一指头
I will never let them touch me.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,228
我的邻居 一定已经开门抱怨了
My neighbor, who must have opened his door to complain.

13
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,791
下一个就是你了 艾迪 我们进来了
You're gonna be next, Eddie! We're coming in!

14
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:18,636
对一个拥有四位数智商的人 我一定错过了什么
For a guy with a four digit IQ, I must have missed something.

15
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,603
却并不多
And I hadn't missed much.

16
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,528
距离影响整个世界只有一步之遥
I'd come this close to having an impact on the world.

17
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:28,464
而现在 唯一会受到我行为影响的只有...
And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on...

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,486
...人行道
...was the sidewalk.

20
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,898
看见那个家伙了吗
You see that guy?

21
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,937
就是我 不久之前的我
That was me, not so long ago.

22
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,930
除了瘾君子和酒鬼 还有谁能这幅德行
What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?

23
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,764
毫无疑问只有作家 说来也怪
Only a writer. Strangely enough,

24
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,567
居然没人愿意相信我还有书约在身
nobody believed that I actually had a book contract.

25
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,302
嗯 虽然是以科幻小说的形式
Well, it's masquerading as a sci-fi novel,

26
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,069
但我的本意是想表现
but it's really, uh, my own personal manifesto

27
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,778
身处21世纪个人的困境
about the plight of the individual in the 21st century.

28
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:14,372
我创造出了一个乌托邦的社会
I sort of created a utopian society

29
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,673
而在那个社会里...我们...嗯...
where we all sort of... Uh... Uh...

30
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:19,473
非常的...真的...
It's really... it's really...

31
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,236
呃...
Uh...

32
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,707
今天一定要写出点什么
Today was the day I was gonna kick its ass.

33
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:32,806
来吧 来吧 加油...
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go...

34
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,979
一定会很棒的
It was gonna be great.

35
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:39,684
只要待在房间里 肯花上时间
Just gotta put in the time. Stay in the room.

36
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:42,728
这就是关键
That's the key concept.

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,932
不能离开房间
Don't leave the room.

38
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:56,111
就这样过去了几周
A few weeks passed this way.

39
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,516
也许是之后的几个月
Maybe a few months.

40
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,648
至少我还有琳迪
At least I still had Lindy.

41
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,480
就这样吗
Just like that?

42
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:14,921
行了 艾迪 这也算是意料之中的事了
Come on, Eddie, This is hardly a surprise,

43
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,459
完全意料之外
I'm surprised,

44
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,727
别这样 好吧 让我...
Let's just not do this, OK? Let me...

45
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,489
我周五就要交给玛勒90页的稿子
I'm gonna hand in 90 pages to Marla on Friday,

46
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,050
你不如等等看她的评价再...
If you just wait to see what she says...

47
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,323
艾迪
Eddie,

48
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,625
什么      我明白的
What?        I know how it's going,

49
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:29,455
我是你的...
I'm your...

50
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,491
我曾经是你的女朋友
I was your girlfriend,

51
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,997
但这个词却不能充分说明你对于我的意义
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me,

52
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:39,465
伙伴? 泄欲对象?
Partner? Squeeze?

53
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,433
爱侣 恋人
Paramour, Inamorata,

54
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:45,697
清扫女工 还有自动提款机
Cleaning lady, Bank,

55
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,166
谢谢 马上给您送过来
Thanks, Be right back,

56
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:50,636
只是...
Be that a...

57
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,035
但我的东西也都是你的啊
What's mine is yours, too,

58
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,504
你很清楚 我愿意与你共度余生
and you know I want to share the rest of my life with you,

59
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,732
我想过也许我们应该...      别求婚 千万别
I was thinking that we should...        Don't propose,

60
00:05:58,674 --> 00:05:59,662
为什么
Why not?

61
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,800
因为上一段婚姻就让你精疲力竭
Because it worked out so well for you last time,

62
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,002
这倒是真的 我结过婚 刚毕业的时候 和梅利莎
It's true, I did marry once. Right out of college, to Melissa.

63
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,304
我愿意
I do,

64
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:09,366
不过非常短暂
Briefly.

65
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:11,539
我做不到
This isn't working,

66
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,998
好吧 就算你说的都是真的 但我还是爱你啊
Well, even though everything you say is true, I still love you,

67
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,870
我得回去工作了
I gotta get back to work,

68
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,071
你还没告诉我为什么啊
You didn't even tell me what happened,

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,500
我做到了      真的吗
I got it,        You did?

70
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,870
嗯哼 我是个编辑了
Mm-hm, I'm an editor,

71
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,374
有自己的助理 你能相信吗
I'll have my own assistant, Can you believe that?

72
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,073
我当然相信啊 这是你应得的啊
Yeah, of course I believe it, You deserve it,

73
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,602
谢谢
Thanks,

74
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,143
好了      好吧
OK,        OK,

75
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,810
她是对的 那为什么还要坚持下去呢
She was right. Why stick it out?

76
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,741
显而易见 我已经错失良机
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.

77
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,247
我们都清楚真正动人心弦的是什么
We both knew what was beckoning.

78
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,581
在新泽西我孩提时代卧室的下铺
The lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Jersey.

79
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:10,244
父亲满心欢喜地迎接我来到
My father happy to welcome me into the challenging field

80
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,377
牙科器械这一充满挑战的领域
of dental supply inventory.

81
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,213
艾迪・莫莱
Eddie Morra,

82
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,584
在所有该被弃之敝履
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten

83
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,178
束之高阁的无用人际关系中
and put away in mothballs,

84
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,223
有什么能比得上前小舅子更无用
is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in-law?

85
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,587
要死了 老兄
Holy shit, man,

86
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,590
是有多久了 9年有没有
What has it been? Like nine years?

87
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:28,886
老天爷      嘿
God!        Hey,

88
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,586
你还好吗 怎么一副沦落街头的样子
You all right? You look like you're living on the streets,

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,648
过得如何
What's going on?

90
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,857
不算..我..嗯..我..你呢
Not much, I... Well... What am I... What's up?

91
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,020
嗯 写东西吧 写了不少
Uh, I'm writing, Writing a lot,

92
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,722
哦 你还没放弃写东西吗
Oh, you're still trying to write?

93
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,019
事实上 我还有书约在身
Matter of fact, I have a book contract,

94
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,924
真的吗      是的
Really?        Yeah,

95
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,487
那很好啊      你呢
That's great,        How about you?

96
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,997
还在贩药吗 弗恩
Are you still dealing, Vern?

97
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,363
我看起来还像干这行的吗      这倒是不像
Do I look like I'm still dealing?        No, you don't, No,

98
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,697
走吧 去喝一杯 给我说说你的书
Come on, let's go get a drink, I want to hear about this book,

99
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,696
不是吧 现在可是下午2点啊
I don't know, It's 2:00 in the afternoon,

100
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,236
这个时间你有什么问题吗
When has that ever stopped you?

101
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,061
怎么说      那...
So,        So...

102
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,799
梅利莎过得好吗
How's Melissa doing?

103
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:08,533
给      谢谢
Here you go,        Thanks,

104
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:12,768
不知道 没见过她 她搬家了 去了北部
Wouldn't know, I don't see her, She moved upstate,

105
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:15,790
好像在做什么网络房屋销售的玩意
She got some kind of Internet home sales kind of job,

106
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,845
带着一大堆孩子
Couple kids,

107
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,443
孩子 那她老公呢
Couple kids, Who's the husband?

108
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:25,037
离了 如果你问的是这个
He walked out on her, if you really want to know,

109
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,544
不过这和你没什么关系吧
But what do you care, man?

110
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,813
算起来你们两个也就结了5分钟的婚
You were married, like, five minutes,

111
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,814
听着 我不想谈她 不如说说你吧
Look, I don't wanna talk about her, I wanna talk about you, OK?

112
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:35,678
说说你的书 进展如何
Tell me about this book, How's it going?

113
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,912
嗯 书的话 呃...
Well, it's, uh...

114
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,382
我...我...
I'm... I'm...

115
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,314
我只是在逃避 用书来做借口逃避
I'm behind, I'm behind on my book,

116
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,749
而这个借口差不多毁了我日日夜夜的生活
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days and nights,

117
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,649
如果那是你想知道的
if you really want to know,

118
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,176
嗯 你已经写了多少呢      一片空白
Well, how much have you written of it?        Not one word,

119
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,688
灵感的问题 是吗      算是吧
Creative problems, huh?        Yeah, Mm-hm,

120
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,557
说不定我能帮上忙
Well, I suppose I can help you with that,

121
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,318
不过仅此一次
Just this once,

122
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,987
哦 不用 真的不用了
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

123
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,548
你根本不知道这是什么      你还在贩药吗
You don't even know what it is,        You're still dealing,

124
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,220
老兄 我不干那玩意儿很多年了
Brother, I am light years from that now,

125
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:15,422
现在我可是某家制药企业的顾问
I've been doing, uh, some consulting for a pharmaceutical company,

126
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,422
什么企业 沿海那些做山寨伟哥的实验室吗
What, like some offshore lab making fake Viagra?

127
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,259
得了 弗恩
Come on, Vern,

128
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,196
不是 这可是明年就会批量生产的高档货
No, This is an exclusive product that's coming on stream next year,

129
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,131
已经通过了临床试验和食药局的认可
They've had clinical trials and it's FDA approved,

130
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,127
好吧 就算纯粹好奇心作祟吧 这...
All right, just out of curiosity and that's all...

131
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,466
拿出来看看吧
Let's see it,

132
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,593
这到底是什么
What's in it?

133
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,532
专家已经证实大脑里的受体
They've identified these receptors in the brain

134
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:42,400
都被触发了特殊的回路
that activate specific circuits,

135
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:46,133
知道他们都怎么说吗 我们使用的只有大脑的20%
And you how they say that we can only access 20 percent of our brain?

136
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:51,298
然而 这个东西...却能让你完全利用自己的大脑
Well, what this does... it lets you access all of it,

137
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,082
弗恩 看看我 算得上事业有成吗
Vern, look at me, Do I look good to you?

138
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,974
不过是个一无是处的倒霉蛋
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass,

139
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,566
我不觉得这么一小片反光的新型药丸
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing

140
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,884
能带来翻天覆地的变化 让我名利两全
into fame and fortune by taking some shiny, brand-new designer drug,

141
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:02,969
甘特
Gant,

142
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,076
什么时候
When?

143
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,171
告诉他不行 不 你告诉他
Tell him we can't do that, No, you tell him,

144
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,242
不行 就是现在
No, now,

145
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:17,481
抱歉我得先走了 艾迪
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here, Eddie,

146
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,211
但我真的...真的还想再多说一句
But I really... I really do want to do this again,

147
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,582
所以 记得给我电话 这份算是送你的了
So, call me, And, uh, that's on the house,

148
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:25,885
我不需要
I don't want it,

149
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:29,181
别不知足 知道这要多少钱吗
Don't be ungrateful, You know how much that costs?

150
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,881
800块 就这么一小粒
Eight hundred bucks, A pop,

151
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,144
别客气
You're welcome,

152
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,718
在回家的路上 我满脑子想得都是梅利莎
All the way home, I thought about Melissa.

153
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,121
她的生活怎么也会变得一团糟 她这么聪明
How could she be a failure, too? She'd been so smart.

154
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:55,087
比周围所有人都聪明
Smarter than anyone around her.

155
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,562
显然 当下的艾迪 和今天下午3点微醉的艾迪
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie,

156
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,723
甚至和过往那个吐在老板桌上的
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie...

157
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,833
偷走将死姑妈止疼药的艾迪总有着直接联系
...vomiting on his boss's desk or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.

158
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,592
所以无怪乎琳迪会弃我而去了
So who could blame Lindy for dumping me?

159
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:21,676
说到底 还能有多糟糕呢
In the end, how much worse could it get?

160
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,155
我什么人都不想见
I didn't want to see anybody.

161
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,097
尤其是房东那位恶毒的小妻子
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.

162
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,497
瓦莱利 才周二呢      听着 我受够了 明白吗
Valerie, Tuesday,        Look, Enough, OK?

163
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,864
是斯蒂文在处理房租 他也许吃你那套
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him,

164
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,868
我突然有了摆脱她更好的理由
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.

165
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,732
我刚刚稀里糊涂地吞下了某种药物
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.

166
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,201
好像房租总不够便宜似的
Like the rent's not low enough!

167
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,964
关于这个药物的效果 我只从弗农那里
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon

168
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,766
获得了少得可怜的信息
about what this drug would do.

169
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,432
就算你现在骑车去送报也还来得及 我说真的
You could even be a bike messenger and come up with that, Really,

170
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,803
如果这是迷幻药又会怎样      真是毫无指望
What if it was a hallucinogen?        It's pathetic,

171
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,238
哦 上帝啊 看她没完没了的碎碎念...
Oh, my God. Listening to her rag...

172
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,002
如果我是你的话 早就直接跳窗了
If I were tripping, I'd jump out a fucking window.

173
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:03,235
嘿 你有没有在听我说
Hello? Are you listening to me?

174
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,334
你还不懂 是不是 你就等着滚去睡大街吧
Do you get it? You are gonna be out on the streets!

175
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,173
然后 我突然感觉到了
And then, I felt it.

176
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:41,416
之前我是盲目的 现在才终于看清了一切
I was blind, but now I see.

177
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,986
...赶紧给我走 都不敢看我的眼睛 知道为啥么
...running away! You can't even look at me, you know why?

178
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,291
因为你根本不算是个男人 根本就不是个男人
Because you're not even a man, You're not even a man!

179
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,727
不付房租 没有工作
You don't have rent! You don't have a job!

180
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:18,194
你怎么了      什么
What's wrong?        What?

181
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,758
你不喜欢我 我不怪你 在你眼里 我是个一无是处
You don't like me and I don't blame you, You see a self-defeating,

182
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,530
浪费生命 靠你丈夫施舍过日子的混球
energy-sucking piece of shit who's sponging off your husband,

183
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,968
你乐见我饮弹自尽
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out,

184
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,937
但我的存在并不该让你觉得不安 到底为什么呢
but my existence shouldn't make you this upset, What is it?

185
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,667
和你有什么关系      是法学院的课程不顺利吗
That's none of your business,        Something wrong at law school?

186
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,138
你怎么知道我在念法律
How do you know I'm in law school?

187
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,833
没有几个正常人会随身带着
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry,

188
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,431
这种读来无趣 某位已故高院法官的迂腐之作
academically-constipated books about a dead Supreme Court justice,

189
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,506
你个变态 你...你跟踪我是不是
You're a creep, aren't you? You've been... You've been following me,

190
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:43,634
不是 我只是看到书而已      你才看到一个角
No, I just noticed the book,        You just saw the corner of it,

191
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,075
怎么能确定
How did you know that?

192
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:48,237
我之前看过 12年前 还在大学的时候
I'd seen it before. Twelve years ago in college.

193
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,608
坐在一个助教的沙发上
Sitting on the couch of a TA I was trying to make,

194
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,408
等着她沐浴归来
waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom,

195
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,470
希冀她能有一个保险套
hoping she'd have a condom.

196
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:57,106
突然之间这个信息就从潜意识中蹦了出来
Somehow my unconscious had served that up.

197
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,705
一段从未被我刻意记忆的片段
A memory I had never even recorded.

198
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:02,512
或者说 长久以来 我需要的只是一把钥匙
Or was it there the whole time and all I needed was the access?

199
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,709
如果你要写论文 这本书绝不是上佳选择
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use,

200
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,581
哈 谁问你意见了
Well, who asked you?

201
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,983
黑斯廷斯有自己的口述历史
Hastings has his oral history,

202
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:08,687
要是我 就会从那里着手
I'd start there,

203
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,744
有趣的是 基本而言 他就是个白痴
Interesting point, Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

204
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,184
他曾经解雇的一位员工
which sort of gives credence to the theory

205
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:13,243
能写出他大部分的观点
that one of the clerks he had fired

206
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:15,480
这种家伙的理论 有谁愿意相信
actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions,

207
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,996
你可以谷歌一下那位雇员的子孙
You could Google the clerk's sons,

208
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:17,954
相信他们非常乐意和你交谈
they'd love to talk to you,

209
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:18,924
为他们父亲脱罪
Exonerate their dad,

210
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,651
也许能给到你一些无人知晓的东西...
That'd give you something that no one else has...

211
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:23,486
古怪博物馆展览的信息 半知半解的文字
Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article,

212
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,582
公共广播公司的某些文档...突然涌到我的额叶
some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes,

213
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,115
自我混合成最绚丽最有用的信息鸡尾酒
mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.

214
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:35,025
她毫无机会      那你有什么建议呢
She didn't have a chance.        So, what are your suggestions?

215
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:42,091
我们确实为她的论文做了不少工作
We'd really worked on her paper, too.

216
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,304
但45分钟后 就演变成了另一种活动
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.

217
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,492
她显然也得到了满足
She was pleased.

218
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:56,498
家 但这里真的是我的家吗
Home. But it couldn't be my home, could it?

219
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:58,802
有谁能忍受住在这样的地方
Who would live like this?

220
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,961
真想一把火烧了这里
My first thought was Torch it.

221
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,681
但理智占了上风
But saner heads prevailed.

222
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,603
这算是什么毒品 完全没有上瘾后的混乱
What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it,

223
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,966
6个小时没抽一支烟 没有进食...
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours, hadn't eaten,

224
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,540
那么是整洁和节制吗
so... abstemious and tidy?

225
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:52,064
这算什么呢 让人记忆力更强的毒品吗
What was this? A drug for people who wanted to be more anal retentive?

226
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,974
我不兴奋也不乖张 只是出人意料的清醒
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired. Just clear.

227
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:57,533
很清楚自己想做什么 该如何去做
I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.

228
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:40,726
第二天清晨 我小小探索了一下自己的大脑
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.

229
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:44,352
毫无任何的澎湃思绪和灵感闪现
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.

230
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:50,991
短暂的光彩过后...我还是我
In short... I was back.

231
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,598
但是 有些东西却留了下来
But, something remained.

232
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:02,722
开玩笑吧你
You're kidding,

233
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,794
没有      居然有白纸黑字装订成册
No,        Words have appeared on paper,

234
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,859
是的      还能是出自你手
Yes,        Written by you,

235
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,335
只求你能看上三张
All you have to do is read three pages,

236
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:14,462
就花一个小时看上三张 然后...
Just read three pages in the next hour and...

237
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,096
...如果你没兴趣读下去 我就把预付款还你
...if you don't want to keep reading, I'll give you back the advance,

238
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,230
好吗
OK,

239
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,836
可以 艾迪      好的
OK, Eddie,        OK,

240
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,751
艾迪 回来了给我电话
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.

241
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:01,446
艾迪 我又看了40页 给我电话
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in. Call me.

242
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:04,682
虽然有些小做作 不过我还在看
It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.

243
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:08,519
说吧 你怎么做到的
OK, how did you do this?

244
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,718
我真的很喜欢...一回来就给我电话 别忘了
I'd really like... Just call me the minute you get in. Call. OK?

245
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,993
谁啊      嘿 弗农 是我 艾迪
Who is it?        Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie,

246
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:37,556
哪个艾迪      嗯 我是莫莱
Eddie who?        Uh, Morra,

247
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,027
现在不是时候 艾迪
It's not a good time, Eddie,

248
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,227
呃 嘿 弗恩 我真的需要和你谈谈
Uh, hey, Vern, I really just need to talk to you,

249
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,431
嘿...哦...
Hey... Oh...

250
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:55,098
弗恩 出什么事了      别担心 我没事
Vern, what happened?        Don't worry about it, I'm fine,

251
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,073
好吧 艾迪 你还是有兴趣了
So, Eddie, You are interested after all,

252
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,596
这玩意儿太神奇了
That stuff's amazing,

253
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,701
如果你够聪明 就更有效果了
Works better if you're already smart,

254
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,437
弗恩 谁把你打成这样的
Vern, who did this to you?

255
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,443
相信我 你不会想知道的
Trust me, you don't want to know,

256
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,874
呃...
Uh...

257
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:15,969
那 这个叫什么来着      在市面上还没有名字
So, uh, what's it called?        Doesn't have a street name yet,

258
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:19,844
但是那些药剂师都叫它NZT 48
But the boys in the kitchen are calling it NZT 48,

259
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:23,143
"药剂师" 我不知道...
"The boys in the kitchen"? I don't...

260
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:26,614
听起来不怎么像是被食药局认可的药品啊 弗恩
That doesn't sound very FDA-approved, Vern,

261
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,800
食药局认可 说什么笑话呢
FDA-approved, that's a laugh,

262
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,345
你不会真相信了吧
You didn't really believe that shit, did ya?

263
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,377
好吧 现在是什么状况
OK, so what do we have here?

264
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,614
某种未知的 未经测试 有潜在危险的药片
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug

265
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,051
从某身份未明的实验室流落出来
scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere

266
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:44,487
经由一个我多年未见 极不可信的家伙交到我手中
given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years.

267
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,422
你还想要吗      是的 当然
So you want some more?        Yes, Definitely,

268
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,392
好吧 这个稍后再谈 但现在我需要有人帮个忙
All right, we'll talk about it, but I, uh, need a favor first,

269
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,654
显然 我现在这个样子是没法出门的
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now, so,

270
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,774
我在想你能不能为我
I was wondering if you could pop down

271
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:02,391
去取一下送洗的西装
to the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me,

272
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:06,829
顺便再帮我弄点..早饭什么的
And maybe grab a little... A little breakfast for us,

273
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,060
他很清楚已经牢牢控制住了我
He knew he had me.

274
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:11,821
好吧
Sure,

275
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,763
从此刻开始 我很乐意成为他的专属小弟
From now on, I'd happily be his errand boy.

276
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:20,131
洗窗 擦马桶...
Wash his windows, scrub his toilet...

277
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,964
...任何事情我都愿意 只要能让那个
...anything I could do to get my hands on that little clear pill

278
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,128
升级版的艾迪重新回来
that would bring back... Enhanced Eddie.

279
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,132
弗恩
Vern?

280
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,007
弗恩
Vern?

281
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:15,052
弗恩...

282
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,814
哦 弗恩
Oh, Vern,

283
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,227
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey!

284
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,421
嘿
Hey!

285
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:02,427
911 请问有什么紧急情况      嘿 我想报警...
911, what's your emergency?        Hi, I need to report a...

286
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,936
...是一起谋杀
...a murder,

287
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,865
7B 是的
7B, yes,

288
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,163
好的 我不会的
OK, I won't,

289
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:20,268
像是等了一世纪 而我站得越久 看得越是明白
Took them forever. And the longer I stood there, the clearer I saw.

290
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,435
弗恩知道凶手是谁
Vern had known whoever had done this.

291
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,371
也明白他们在找的是什么
And one guess what they'd been looking for.

292
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,709
但他们找到了吗
But had they found it?

293
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,220
要命 如果你是自己开伙 那我这条命也交代了
Shit, if you ever cooked, I'd be dead, too,

294
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,533
我们是警察 请开门
Police Department! Open the door, please!

295
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,941
我们是警察 开门
Police Department! Open the door!

296
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:06,411
请立刻开门
Open the door, please!

297
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,939
我们是警察 开门
Police! Open the door!

298
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,947
我们进去 开门
Let's go! Open the door!

299
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:14,346
把手举起来      嘿
Let me see your hands,        Hey,

300
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,382
把手举起来      不是我 不 是我报的警
Let me see your hands!        No, no, I'm the one who called!

301
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,882
是我叫你们来的
I called you guys!

302
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,781
这么说 你们的关系不错咯 经常一起出入吗
So, you guys tight? Hang out a lot?

303
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,165
也不算是 他是我前妻的兄弟
No, my ex-wife's brother,

304
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,753
我也只是才和他在路上遇到
I just actually ran into him on the street

305
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:29,445
然后他让我上去坐坐...
and he asked me to come up to...

306
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:30,816
再买点毒品什么的吗
Buy some drugs?

307
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,254
不 不是的 什么意思      这家伙做什么的
No, no, What?        What did this guy do?

308
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:37,653
他...嗯 我不知道 他之前 嗯...
He... Uh, I don't know, He was, um...

309
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:40,351
听说他之前是个古董贩卖商
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?

310
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:44,056
贩卖商吗      是的 嗯 古董方面的 嗯...
A dealer?        Yeah, uh, antiques, Um...

311
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:47,184
好像是 维也纳风格的...
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...

312
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,026
...椅子什么的
...chairs and stuff,

313
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:52,789
就像是 你知道的 那种圈腿椅之类的
Like, you know, like curlicue leg things,

314
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:53,954
你好
Yeah?

315
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,020
没错 是有一位艾德华・莫莱
That is correct, An Edward Morra,

316
00:24:58,098 --> 00:24:59,428
他就在这里
He's here,

317
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,024
受害者的妹妹
Victim's sister,

318
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,629
我已经有10年没有听到她的声音了
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.

319
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,096
艾迪      梅利莎
Eddie?        Melissa?

320
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,734
你当时在场吗      是的...
You were there?        Um...

321
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:17,896
我之前正好在街上遇到他 所以 是的...
Just before, I had run into him on the street and, uh... yeah,

322
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,767
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

323
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,169
我都不觉得奇怪 他是卷入了件麻烦里
I wish I was more surprised. He was involved in some stuff.

324
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,473
我不应该多说的
I'd better not say any more.

325
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,735
是的 没错 这也许是个好主意
No, no, that's probably a good idea,

326
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:33,367
那么 嗯...也许我们应该见个面什么的
So, uh... We should probably, uh, meet or something, right?

327
00:25:33,443 --> 00:25:37,113
不用了 我还要处理丧礼还有各种乱七八糟的事
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else.

328
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:38,174
我只是...
I just...

329
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,438
我们不能见面 好吗
We can't meet, OK?

330
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:41,910
好吧 嗯 我只是...
Right, Well, I'll just...

331
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,308
那葬礼上见吧
I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then,

332
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,277
不了 我不想 别这样 再联系吧 好吗
No. I don't want that. Please don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?

333
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,371
等事情都结束了      好的 那就这样吧
When this is over.        OK, all right,

334
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,675
好的
OK.

335
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:59,809
要知道 现在有些事情还不明朗
You know, something doesn't gel here,

336
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:03,512
留下你的电话 稍后也许会再联系你
Write down your number, I may need to contact you later,

337
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:38,430
值得冒这个风险吗
Worth the risk?

338
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,666
如果是你 会如何呢
What would you do?

339
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:20,064
弗恩留下的现金 加上一些前所未有潮涌的冲动
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation,

340
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,772
促使我在4天里面完成了一整本小说
enabled me to finish the book in four days.

341
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,138
一天一片
A tablet a day

342
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:37,648
每天的时间都是如此有限而珍贵
and what I could do with my day was limitless.

343
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,081
我在3天里学会了弹奏钢琴
I learned to play the piano in three days.

344
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,943
数学变得有用
Math became useful.

345
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:46,978
而充满奇趣
And fun.

346
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,645
全跟
I'm all in,

347
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,855
只是半知半解 已足以让我熟练运用一门新语言
Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent.

348
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,882
那你觉得莎士比亚抖的小包袱其实很普通咯
So that Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?

349
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,716
毫无争辩之意
There's no arguing with you,

350
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:12,392
这种感觉太棒了
This was great.

351
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:15,553
听我说 妈妈 关于海伦姑妈的肿瘤 我做了些研究
So, Mom, I've been doing a little research on Aunt Helen's tumor,

352
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,147
非常明确的一点就是
And it's totally clear that

353
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:19,000
任何罹患此类家族性腺瘤性息肉的人
anybody with familial adenomatous polyposis

354
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,427
应当接受含铂类双重
should be supplementing platinum-based doublet regiments

355
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:22,976
二十碳五烯酸补充治疗
with eicosapentaeonic acid,

356
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,758
突然之间我变得无所不知 无所不晓
I suddenly knew everything. About everything.

357
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:27,236
当然 这只是一个短期的刺激
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,

358
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,220
但过快的增长
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

359
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,629
是否会导致两年内股票的彻底贬值呢
devalue that stock completely in two years?

360
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:30,840
不会 因为安全机制的存在
No, because there are safeguards,

361
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,227
限制了侵略性过度膨胀?
Against aggressive over-expansion?

362
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:34,633
没有用的 在人性中不存在所谓的安全机制
There aren't, Because there are no safeguards in human nature,

363
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,227
过犹不及通常带来失败
We're wired to overreach,

364
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,532
回顾整个历史 看看那些曾颠覆世界的国家
Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world,

365
00:28:38,604 --> 00:28:40,093
葡萄牙曾拥有大量傲视当世的海军
Portugal with this big massive navy,

366
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,968
现在呢 只剩下了腌鳕鱼和廉价保险套
All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms,

367
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,027
更别说曾经的日不落帝国了
And the Brits?

368
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,302
只能蜗居在潮湿阴冷的岛国
Now they're just sitting on a dank little island

369
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:45,243
为明天的西装忧心不已
fussing over their suits,

370
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,134
为什么就没人愿意停下思考一下
No one's stopping and thinking,

371
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,000
"嘿 我们已经做得很好了
"Hey, we're doing pretty well,

372
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,490
占领了法国 波兰还有瑞士银行里巨大的存款
We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account,

373
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,252
为什么还要大冷天的跑去侵略什么俄罗斯
You know what? Let's not invade Russia in the winter,

374
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:54,072
踏实回家 举杯庆祝 依靠这些利息颐养天年吧"
Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest,"

375
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:55,609
说的没错
Yeah,

376
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,005
这些所思所感如潮水般从我脑中涌出
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.

377
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,244
所有我曾经读过 听过 看过的东西
Everything I had ever read, heard, seen

378
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:01,932
都变成了条理分明 随时可用的观点
was now organized and available.

379
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,904
就是这里 你到了
Here it is. Here you go.

380
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,812
艾迪 嘿 听我说 我想你应该在做一些投资
Eddie, Hey, Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio,

381
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:10,076
当然如果没有的话 我非常乐意和你一起工作
but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you,

382
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,547
好的 凯文
OK, Kevin,

383
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,346
我结交了新朋友 应邀前往海滩
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.

384
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,233
当然不是近在眼前的海滩
The beach was not nearby.

385
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,421
曾经的战战兢兢和羞涩腼腆 都离我而去
All my fear, all my shyness, gone.

386
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,358
他们做了四次基本审查...
They've done four basic trials...

387
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,854
但只是懒散度日并不足够
But mere lounging wasn't enough.

388
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,028
唯一麻烦是 如果无法继续前进
Only problem? If I wasn't moving forward,

389
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,369
我一定会承受不了而崩溃
I felt like I was going to explode.

390
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,600
快过来 这里太美了 是不是
Come up here because it's beautiful, right?

391
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:14,539
有人想试试看吗      你疯了吧
Anybody ever jump?        Are you crazy?

392
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,943
他真的会跳的      别扯了
He's gonna do it,        He's not gonna do it,

393
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,035
哦 上帝
Oh, my God!

394
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,705
哦
Oh!

395
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,576
啊
Ah!

396
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:44,710
就在此刻我有了主意
And then I began to form an idea.

397
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:47,218
我突然明白了该做的到底是什么
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.

398
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,879
无关创造 更无关书本
It wasn't writing. It wasn't books.

399
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:51,978
远甚于这些
It was much bigger than that.

400
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:56,620
但我需要足够的钱来完成这一切
But it would take money to get there.

401
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,183
在下游市场 没有人能赚到足够的资本
In a down market, no one was making much.

402
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,690
同样这些人也没有NZT
But no one had NZT.

403
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,987
以最乐观的预计
In an optimistic scenario,

404
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,890
这种自然的收益只能反映
gains of that nature merely would reflect

405
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,860
经济的增长 而并不会造成任何障碍的产生...
growth in the economy and would not pose an obstacle...

406
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:23,694
用弗恩剩下的最后800块 在一天之内赚了2000
Armed with Vern's last $800, I made 2,000 in a day.

407
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,097
第二天 变成了7500
Next day, 7,500.

408
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:29,565
还是太慢 我需要更多的资金
It was too slow. I'd need more capital.

409
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,598
但银行不会贷款给我这样的人
But banks weren't lending to guys like me.

410
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:33,658
嘿 利夫
Hey, Liev,

411
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:36,225
你要找的人就坐在角落里
That's your man in the corner back there,

412
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,564
好的
Yeah,

413
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:54,662
利夫应该已经和你说了 我想找笔短期借贷
So, uh, Liev told you that I'm looking for a short-term loan?

414
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,634
是的 我让利夫拉倒吧
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it,

415
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:58,191
为什么
Why?

416
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,363
因为我不认识你 更他妈的开始不喜欢你了
Because I don't see you before and I don't fucking like you already,

417
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:05,404
所以我为什么要借你十万呢
Why do I give you $100,000?

418
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,035
因为...
Because...

419
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:12,600
...我有能力在四天之内让这些钱涨五倍
...I quintupled my money four days in a row,

420
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:14,641
这么说 你有内幕消息吗
So you got a fix on the game,

421
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,470
不 不算是
No, not a fix,

422
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,940
我只是运用一些计算法则得出了某些定式
I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms,

423
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,442
如果你看下第四栏的话 是第一...
If you look at column four, this was the first...

424
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,869
你说的没错
You're good,

425
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,302
我是有消息
OK, it's a fix,

426
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:33,438
要知道 你们这种人总会被逮住的
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,

427
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:34,481
到时候你要怎么办
What are you gonna do then?

428
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:38,405
至少我没有什么写有你大名的黑名册
Well, it's not as if I have a black book with your name in it,

429
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,269
如果你关心的是这个问题
if that's what you're talking about,

430
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,603
此外 我有很强的预感
And besides, I get the strong feeling

431
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,540
我绝不愿意轻易让你失望
that you're not somebody I want to disappoint,

432
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,168
别起来 我说了别起来
Don't get up, I said don't get up,

433
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,575
坐好了      嘿 好的
Sit down!        Hey, OK,

434
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:58,808
拿了这钱 你的小命就是我的了      好的
OK, you take this, you mine,        OK,

435
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,506
听好了 如果到时候不还钱 后果你很清楚吧
You understand? You don't pay, you know what we do?

436
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,605
我会直接腰斩了你
I cut you at waist,

437
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,479
剥了你的皮 绑到你脑袋顶上去
Peel your skin up over your head and tie knot in it,

438
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,949
窒息这玩意儿 你绝不会想死那么难看
You don't die from this, You suffocate,

439
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:13,382
好的      祝你好运了
OK,        Good luck,

440
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,152
我的新朋友 凯文・道尔 教会了我
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage

441
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:28,122
如何在当日交易公司 让一块钱变成两块半
two and a half times your cash at the day trading firm.

442
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,054
一周以来 我不断的增加用量
I'd been upping the dose for over a week.

443
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,917
似乎确实缩短了我的学习曲线
It seemed to cut my learning curve.

444
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:52,196
为什么要买这个 他们的CEO刚刚受到控告
Why are you buying that? The CEO was just indicted,

445
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:55,097
但并不是因为他贿赂的事情
But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into,

446
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,598
还会上涨的 下周就会宣布
That's still on, Should be announced next week,

447
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,566
我刚刚黑入了系统 重新启动
I was jacked in. Booted up.

448
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,431
在周末 我的经纪人账户
At the end of the week, my brokerage account

449

最不可能的事情居然成真了 老兄
and, well, the impossible happened, bud.

460
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,311
我们给你安排了和卡尔・范隆的碰面
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.

461
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,871
卡尔・范隆要见你吗
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

462
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,609
显然是有这么回事      但你不并擅长金融行业
Apparently so,        But you're not in the finance game,

463
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,309
你能帮卡尔・范隆做什么
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

464
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,249
你什么时候学的意大利语

465
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,849
哦 自我提升的几个月吧
Oh, Self-improvement month,

466
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,017
大概是谁点醒了我吧
I guess somebody gave me a wake up call,

467
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:16,293
希望不是因为我
I hope you didn't do it for me,

468
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:18,486
不 我只是希望能向你道歉 琳
No, I just wanted to apologize to you, Lin,

469
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:23,287
让你明白 我的自我毁灭
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage

470
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:25,353
并非无下限
wasn't boundless after all,

471
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:29,395
而我真正想知道的是 为什么要这样容忍我
The real question is, why did you ever put up with me?

472
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,492
因为那时候我爱你
I was in love with you,

473
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,793
嗯 书什么时候出版

Oh, that's right,

Can I have it back?        Uh... Nope,

494
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:56,047
不行吗      我想说的是 一定是要原来那把吗
No?        I mean, does it have to be that key?

495
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:57,947
不能有一把新钥匙吗
Can it be a new key?

496
00:36:58,611 --> 00:36:59,745
我们家的新钥匙
To our place?

497
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:06,486
这代价可不小啊      你是说我不够务实
It would be cost effective,        And you say I'm not practical,

498
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:19,451

现在 听好了 这个人反复无常
Now, be warned, He's mercurial,

前一秒 可能是你最好的朋友
One minute, your best friend,

而下一秒 就对你避之不及
the next, you're a leper,

512
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,789
他需要的是最为直接的答复
And he needs direct answers,

513
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,182
任何的试探犹豫都会让你错失良机
Anything tentative and you've lost him forever,

514
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,915
我们应该排练一下的
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios,

520
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,017
财富的象征
He's worth a fortune,

521
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:08,290
嘿 约翰      嘿 卡尔 见到你很高兴
Hey, John,        Hey, Carl, Good to see you,

522
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,919
你好啊      艾迪
How are ya?        Eddie,

523
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,465
那么 艾迪・莫莱
So, Eddie Morra,

524
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,557
你的秘密是什么      药物
What's your secret?        Medication,

525
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,328
我在服用某种特殊药物
I'm on special medication,

526
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:26,391
好的
OK,

527
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,932
某种特殊的复合配方
Well, it's a formula with a complex method,

528
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,436
当然 调研 大量的调研也是其中一部分
But, of course, research was a component, Massive research,

529
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,563
我清楚了解自己购买公司的每一丝架构
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought,

530
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,265
我办公室的资料堆积如山 知道这意味着什么吗
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office, and you know what?

531
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,500
股价上涨      说对了一点
The stocks went up,        By a hair,

532
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:44,736
没错 股价是在上涨 但谁愿意为某个
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work

533
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,365
毫无远见的领导者工作
for a shitty little uptake?

534
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:47,616
你想要的并不是
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want

535
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,604
短期的持有或是增长...
in short term holdings so...

536
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,371
...抛弃所有的统计数据
...I dispensed with all the hard statistics

537
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,740
我直接在市场传闻中捕捉需要的信息
and I went right to the rumor mill,

538
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:54,451
你的股票都是这样买进的吗
So you bought your stocks based on what?

539
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,155
街边的小道消息?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

540
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,536
自然 股价的高低并非真正基于公司的运营状况
Sure, Share prices aren't really based on how a company works,

541
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,103
更多的是对群众心理的把握
It's about how mass psychology works,

542
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,409
所以如果我发现了股价预测的某种计算方式
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...

543
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:05,993
模式识别 看来这就是你骗人的万灵油咯
Pattern recognition, That's your snake oil,

544
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:08,179
但 并非所有人都能理解这种模式
Well, not everybody understands the patterns,

545
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,865
这让我更具灵性
And that gave me a little bit more of an uptake,

546
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,065
但这也不过是拿不出手的小把戏
but it's just a parlor trick,

547
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,643
然后 我打算另辟蹊径
So then, I went on to door number three,

548
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:16,049
你是暗示自己已经找到了某种终端公式吗
Are you really implying that you have some sort of ultimate formula?

549
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,383
好吧 10天里 从一万两千到两三百万的累积
Well, from 12,000 to 2,3 million in ten days,

550
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:22,910
我自然有公式 皮尔斯先生      夸大妄想
I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce,        Delusions of grandeur,

551
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,575
我并非夸大妄想
I don't have delusions of grandeur,

552
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:27,219
我有的是宏伟建筑的详细计划
I have an actual recipe for grandeur,

553
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:32,514
我不知道你是谁 也不清楚你的把戏
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what you game is,

554
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,569
但有一点我很肯定
but I'm sure of one thing,

555
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:34,756
你并不是我会任而用之的人
You don't work in my world,

556
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,906
我太熟悉所谓的投资人
I'm up to my ass with investment guys

557
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:38,320
你不像他们是惶恐不安
and you don't have their half-terrified,

558
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,385
和妄自尊大的混合体...
half-cocky line of crap which is...

559
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,189
...但这并不意味着我会更欣赏你
...not to say that I like yours any better,

560
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:44,760
但显而易见的是 你以一种
But you obviously pick your stocks

561
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,230
我从未见识过的方式选择股票
in a way which I haven't seen before,

562
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:50,230
看看这些公司 然后告诉我你的想法
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think,

563
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,662
现在吗      是的 你可以慢慢来
Right now?        Yeah, Take your time,

564
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,532
当然
Sure,

565
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:12,030
这些公司并不是问题所在 对吗
These companies aren't the question, are they?

566
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:14,768
解释下
Explain,

567
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,398
除非你两边都有插手
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence,

568
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,304
控制住整个能源市场 但是 不对
Control the whole power enchilada, but, no,

569
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,864
这些公司并不足以让你入主
these companies wouldn't get you there in emerging markets,

570
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,000
你还必须...哦 喔哦
You would have to... Oh, Whoa,

571
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:28,703
一定是了 你深思熟虑过的某种合并大案子
This must be some big-ass merger you're contemplating,

572
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,709
真正有能力和范隆合作的
And there's really only one company with enough bling

573
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:34,768
只有一家公司
to justify a merger with Van Loon and Associates,

574
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:37,774
你以为是在和谁说话
Who have you been talking to?

575
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:38,781
哦 我只是将线索连接
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots,

576
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,509
汉克・阿特伍德真的会同意吗
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

577
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,256
嗯 你要么是个惊人的诈骗艺术家
Well, you're an amazing con artist,

578
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,108
要么就是个聪明绝顶的年轻人
or you're a very smart young man,

579
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,912
行了 你们两个合作?
I mean, come on, The two of you together?

580
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,542
整个世界就会像奥利弗・特维斯特一样
The whole world would have to come begging for energy

581
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,642
端着破碗向你们乞讨能源
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel,

582
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,243
你现在是倒退了 还看出什么
Now you're going backwards, What else you got?

583
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,583
预言 这行不通的      为什么
A prediction, It won't come off,        Why's that?

584
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:02,020
除非能放弃利比亚      真的吗
You'd have to back off Libya,        Really?

585
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,516
好吧 你不会想从搭你便车的笨蛋那里
Well, you don't want to hear this from some schmuck

586
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:05,689
听到这些信息
who needs a ride home,

587
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,167
好吧 你赢了
All right, you get your shot,

588
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:10,353
明早10点圣瑞吉酒店见
Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

589
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,688
让我看看这位贪婪的搭便车的小笨蛋
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home

590
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,988
会如何重组这些交易 你最好做好充分的准备
would re-structure these deals, And you'd better be prepared,

591
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,583
悉听尊便
I'm at your disposal,

592
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,651
你不会真住在这里吧
You don't really live here, do you?

593
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,958
嗯...艰苦朴素通常不怎么喜闻乐见
Well... Spartans weren't big on amenities,

594
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,324
是的 他们通常会摔得很惨
Yeah, and they eventually got their asses kicked,

595
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:37,960
我没有进屋 更想四处走走 消化再吸收
I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.

596
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,488
生活中就是有这样的时候
There are moments in life...

597
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:41,333
你清楚自己离成功只有一步之遥
moments when you know you've crossed a bridge.

598
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:42,733
你过去的失败已成过往
Your old life is over.

599
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,702
而范隆就是我的那一步 我终于走到了这里
Van Loon was my bridge. I finally had my shot.

600
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,296
华尔街会提供所需的一切 但我又能走多远呢
Wall Street would provide my nest egg, but then how far could I go?

601
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:53,066
CEO 全球力量 也许还能是总统
CEO? A global force? Maybe President.

602
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,727
是到了有人来撼动这个世界 完成事业的时候了
Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.

603
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:09,818
突然之间...
Suddenly...

604
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:16,456
又是一个跳跃 我怎么走过了20个街区呢
It was another skip. How had I gone the last 20 blocks?

605
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,924
又是10个 然后...
I got another ten blocks. And then...

606
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:27,388
...又到了住宅区
...I was way uptown.

607
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:13,009
这是哪个酒吧
What bar was this?

608
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:29,139
...黑色的油画布 这样他们能将所有的颜料...
...black canvas and then they would just drop all the paint...

609
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:33,683
是的 你有没有见过...
Yeah, Did you ever meet...

610
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,412
...然后我就去吃午饭了 回家...
...and then I actually went there and had lunch, I went back,

611
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:38,510
我的朋友都财源滚滚...
My friends are rolling...

612
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,687
听说你很喜欢派对
I heard you like to party.

613
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:09,060
嘿 小心点      嘿 嘿 别激动
Hey, watch it,        Hey, hey! Take it easy!

614
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:12,155
打架? 我应该不会的
A fight? Don't know how to fight.

615
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:13,722
不过 真的不会吗
Or do I?

616
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,201
用手指勾伸入嘴内部
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.

617
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:29,504
就像这样
Like this.

618
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:42,141
攻击敏感区域 眼睛 咽喉 腹股沟
Attack the sensitive areas. The eyes, the throat, the groin.

619
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,835
一旦得手 不要停止
If you are hit, do not stop.

620
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:52,505
你的坚持不懈会让袭击者退缩
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.

621
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,339
让对手失去平衡
Off-balancing your opponent

622
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:58,279
并利用他的冲力 带倒他
and then using his momentum, take him down.

623
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:31,656
当一切静止的时候
When it finally stopped,

624
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:35,251
我完全无法拼凑出生命中过去的18个小时
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.

625
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,029
嘿 是我 我本以为你会来
Hey, it's me. I thought you were coming over.

626
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:03,127
你还好吗 接到留言给我电话
Is everything OK? Call me when you get this.

627
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:47,356
即便没有NZT 我仍决定尝试研究范隆的文件
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.

628
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,759
却发现根本就是天书一般的存在
They were hieroglyphs.

629
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,723
喂      凯文 我是艾迪
Hello?        Kevin, this is Eddie.

630
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,822
艾迪      听我说
Eddie?        Listen,

631
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:06,832
今天我去不了了      你在说什么
I can't make the meeting today.        What are you talking about?

632
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,566
我今天去不了 我病了
I can't come in today, I'm sick,

633
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:11,863
哦 你不会现在就得了流感吧
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now,

634
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,231
他不会再给我们第二次机会的
He'll never give you this chance again,

635
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:18,896
我知道 听着 只是...还有数据要分析
I know, listen, I just... I have all this data to analyze...

636
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:21,733
那你昨天去干了什么
What have you been doing for the last day?

637
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:26,072
凯文 我...      你不明白吗 这是对你的测试
Kev, I...        Don't you get it? This is your test,

638
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:29,740
是的 我明白 但此时此刻我无法通过这个测试
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now,

639
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,968
如果你不行 我要怎么办
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

640
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,736
我明白 听我说 我只是...      你安静听我说
I know, listen, I just...        Sh, Listen to me,

641
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,572
收拾好你自己 准时来赴约
Pull yourself together, Get down to the meeting,

642
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,604
好吧 好吧 我去 我会去的
OK, OK, I'll be there, I'll be there,

643
00:49:09,088 --> 00:49:11,384
嘿 你好      艾迪
Hey, how are ya?        Eddie,

644
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:13,116
很高兴再次见到你
Good to see you again,

645
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,686
请坐
Sit down,

646
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:21,149
你对汉克・阿特伍德了解多少
What do you know about Hank Atwood?

647
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,087
阿特伍德 嗯...
Atwood, um...

648
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,019
他是个传统叛逆者 嗯...
He's an iconoclast, um...

649
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:32,028
拥有大半科罗拉多州的财富
Owns about half of Colorado,

650
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:35,155
这就是你精心准备的结果吗 艾迪
So this is prepared, Eddie?

651
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,220
嗯...
Uh...

652
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:38,408
算是阿特伍德入门知识吗
Is this Atwood 101?

653
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:40,494
还有谁不认识阿特伍德的吗
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

654
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:42,192
他两年前在哪里
Where was he two years ago?

655
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:47,532
嗯      哪里都不是
Hm?        Nowhere,

656
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:52,292
两年前他还没在福布斯的榜上
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar,

657
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,160
巨大的飞跃 不是吗
That was a great leap forward, right?

658
00:49:57,038 --> 00:50:00,802
我看不懂这家伙 他就这么凭空窜出 强势有力
I'm baffled by this guy, He comes out of nowhere so strong,

659
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,840
在我还没机会深入敌营之前 就让我疲于应对了
Has me on the run before I can even get to anybody in his camp,

660
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:05,567
在两项产业上 给了我沉重一击
Beats me out of two properties,

661
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:08,233
投资了毫无原油资源 更是我从未触及的领域
investing in countries with no oil, Places I'd never go near...

662
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:17,942
我们现在位于一家酒店的门口
We're here in front of the hotel where a woman,

663
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,881
昨晚 一位名叫玛利亚・温贝里的女性
identified as Maria Winberg,

664
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:21,965
被证实死于酒店房间
was found dead in her room last night,

665
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,152
成为不法行为的受害者
a victim of foul play.

666
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:28,008
温贝里女士是知名的社交名媛 模特...
Ms. Winberg was a well-known socialite and model...

667
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:32,278
...更因其乐衷慈善而誉满全城
...but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.

668
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,545
警方花费了数个小时询问酒店雇员及顾客
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons

669
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:38,813
有目击证人证实目睹一名男人离开现场...
and an eyewitness reported seeing a man leaving the scene...

670
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,738
...能否帮我说服他可以和我合作
... help me convince him that I can raise his game,

671
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,615
你有什么意见吗
Got any ideas?

672
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:44,449
你怎么看
What do you think?

673
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:50,187
酒店内设置了足够的监控录像...
Hotel has adequate security cameras...

674
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:57,357
艾迪 你不是这种人吧 是不是
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?

675
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:59,483
房间里摆个电视就能让你思想分散吗
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?

676
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,455
我们的世界正在悄无声息地发生改变
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us,

677
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,154
抱歉 容我暂离片刻
Pardon me, one second.

678
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:31,748
可能吗 我杀人了?
Was it possible? Could I have killed someone?

679
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:35,917
真是我干的?
Was it even me?

680
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:43,219
艾迪? 我是梅利莎
Eddie? This is Melissa.

681
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,869
弗农不会给过你什么吧
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?

682
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,188
那东西很危险
Because that stuff is dangerous.

683
00:51:47,263 --> 00:51:48,728
梅利莎?
Melissa?

684
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:51,458
梅利莎 我们能找地方见面吗
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?

685
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,924
我需要和你谈谈      我们正谈着呢
I really need to talk to you,        We're talking now.

686
00:51:53,998 --> 00:51:55,509
不是这样的 中午在...
No, no, let's meet at, uh... 

687
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,330
格兰特的比利餐厅碰头怎么样
Billy's on Grant at noon?

688
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:59,729
你不能见我      不 不...
You can't see me, Eddie.        No, no...

689
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,926
拜托 艾迪      拜托 来吧 我...
Eddie, please.        Please, please come, please come, I...

690
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:06,059
这很重要 我需要弄明白你的意思
It's important, I really need to know what you're talking about,

691
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,899
我意识到也许还有其他人知道NZT的存在
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.

692
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:14,369
弗农的其他客户
Vernon's other clients.

693
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,107
你好      你好
Hi.        Yeah, hi,

694
00:52:55,187 --> 00:52:56,652
我想找一下杰瑞・布莱迪
may I please speak with Jerry Brady?

695
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,119
杰瑞住院了      他怎么了
Jerry's in the hospital.        He's what?

696
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:01,051
他的病情非常不乐观
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.

697
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:05,987
你好 请问保罗・卡普兰在吗      不 他不在
Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?        Uh, no. No, he's not.

698
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:09,319
保罗三天前去世了
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.

699
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,220
我的天 请节哀
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,

700
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,959
起初他感觉头疼 随后在工作中倒下
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.

701
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,391
现在他在重症监护室
Now he's in the ICU.

702
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,689
请代我问候他 谢谢
OK, please give him my best, Thank you,

703
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:24,128
我电话问过的人当中 三个死了 其余病重
Of all the people I called... three were dead and the rest were sick.

704
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:51,697
喂 喂
Hello? Hello?

705
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:10,869
小心点 哥们儿!
Watch it, man!

706
00:54:28,152 --> 00:54:29,243
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

707
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:31,809
喂!
Hey!

708
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:41,055
快走! 快走!
Go! Go!

709
00:55:07,866 --> 00:55:09,162
艾迪
Eddie,

710
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:13,064
梅利莎
Melissa,

711
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:21,599
嗨
Hey,

712
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,802
别说我容光焕发 因为我知道
Don't tell me I look good, 'cause I know,

713
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:32,863
自己不希望你见到我这鬼样子
I didn't want you to see me this way,

714
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,238
你看上去挺好
You look good,

715
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:38,036
我...
Oh, I, uh...

716
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:40,505
是啊 我重新振作了起来
Yeah, I sorta got myself together,

717
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,700
NZT就有这个效果
NZT will do that to you,

718
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,677
你这是什么意思      我的意思是 我也吃了
What do you mean?        I mean, I took it, too,

719
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:49,408
弗农什么也没告诉你 对吗
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?

720
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,571
没有
No,

721
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,706
他和我提起这种神奇新药的时候
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,

722
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:56,405
我正处于人生谷底 而它 确实太神了
I was like, down the hatch, And it was, It was amazing,

723
00:55:57,003 --> 00:56:00,743
我45分钟就读完了布莱恩・格林的"宇宙的琴弦"
I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes

724
00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:02,081
并且能够理解消化
and I understood it,

725
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:04,448
转瞬之间我的工作效率疯狂提升
My work rate increased just insanely overnight

726
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:06,213
我老板为此恨死我了
and my boss started to hate me,

727
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:13,020
上面把他的位置给了我 然后...我开始感到恐惧
They offered me his job and then... and then I got scared,

728
00:56:13,822 --> 00:56:16,563
为什么      为什么 因为我不蠢
Why?        Why? Because I'm not stupid,

729
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:19,871
没人能负担如此高速的大脑运转而不崩溃
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash,

730
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:24,123
我停止了服药
I stopped taking it,

731
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:28,558
然后呢      然后我就病了 头疼
And?        And I got sick, Headaches,

732
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:34,322
呕吐 于是我又去找弗农
Throwing up, So I went back to Vernon,

733
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:36,251
他告诉我所有服用的人都在陆续死去
He told me about all the people that were dying,

734
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:39,798
你吃了多少 艾迪
How much have you been taking, Eddie?

735
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,869
吃了很多
I've been taking a lot,

736
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:48,202
那也许...也许他们解决了那个缺陷 也许...
Well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs, Maybe...

737
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,662
也许那不是同一批药
Maybe this is a different batch,

738
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:54,937
也许吧      你现在没服用了 对吧
Yeah,        You're off it right now, aren't you?

739
00:56:55,006 --> 00:56:57,495
先把你的故事讲完
Just finish your story,

740
00:56:57,574 --> 00:57:00,439
...我没再服用 也就活了下来
...I didn't take any more and I didn't die,

741
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:04,867
但过了一段时间 我发现自己再也无法
But after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything

742
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,137
集中精力超过十分钟
for longer than ten minutes,

743
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:11,304
我...我赶不上截稿日期 懒惰 拖拖拉拉
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow,

744
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,478
那是两年前的事了
That was two years ago,

745
00:57:16,414 --> 00:57:18,472
而我到现在都还没恢复过来
And I haven't been the same since,

746
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:27,082
你的药还有剩余吗 很好
Do you have some left? Good,

747
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,460
回家马上吃了 
You go home and you take it, 

748
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,516
不要停止服药
You take the dose down, but you don't just stop,

749
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:32,347
停止服药你就死定了
You'll die if you just stop,

750
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:37,784
逐渐降低服药量 否则头疼只是噩梦的开始
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning,

751
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:41,320
我得走了
I have to go,

752
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:45,781
你知道谁发明了这个药吗      我不知道
Do you know who makes it?        I don't know,

753
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:48,824
我得走了
I have to go,

754
00:58:19,503 --> 00:58:24,300
该死 听我说 听我说 好吧
Oh, shit, Listen, listen, listen, Listen, listen, listen... OK,

755
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,098
你忘记我的事了?      没有 没有
You forget about me, huh?        No, no, no, no,

756
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:28,138
12点你没出现
12:00 and you're not here,

757
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,196
我现在来了      很好
I'm here now, Oh!        Good,

758
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:34,500
快点 赶紧走      我可以给你开支票
Come on, get going,        I could write you a check,

759
00:58:34,574 --> 00:58:39,564
支票 支票 你脑子进水了?
Check, Check, Are you out of your mind?

760
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:41,905
你以为我是干什么的 做正经融资的吗
What do you think I am? Some financial institution?

761
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,069
好吧 你说得对 我们只需要去家银行
All right, You're right, Look, we just need to go to a bank...

762
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:51,011
那是什么玩意儿
What do you got there?

763
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,713
那是什么      只是阿司匹林
What is it?        No, it's just aspirin,

764
00:58:57,782 --> 00:59:03,274
看上去可不像阿司匹林 是好东西 对吧
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see, It's something good, huh?

765
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:26,184
我感觉不错 那到底是什么
I feel good, man, What's in this stuff?

766
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:29,056
只是维生素和阿司匹林
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin,

767
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:32,855
纯属胡说八道 艾迪小子
You full of shit, Eddie baby,

768
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,360
琳迪 我没让他进来 但是...
Lindy, I wouldn't have let him in, but...

769
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:04,166
抱歉      泰勒 抱歉先挂了
I'm sorry...        Tyler, I gotta go,

770
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:07,033
我病了
I'm sick,

771
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:12,440
我不该来的... 抱歉 但我走不回家了
I shouldn't... I'm sorry, I couldn't make it home,

772
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,601
我们马上去医院      不 不 不
Let's get you to a hospital,        No, no, no, no, no, I don't need...

773
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:16,733
我需要你去拿...
I need you to get...

774
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:20,800
非常简单 我需要服药
It's really simple, babe, I need my pills,

775
01:00:20,877 --> 01:00:23,470
艾迪 什么药      我不...宝贝 这一言难尽
Eddie, what pills?        I don't... Babe, it's complicated,

776
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:26,308
你在服什么药 吸毒吗
What are you taking? Are you on drugs?

777
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,347
它们是...它是...
They're... it's...

778
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:32,711
我别无选择 只好向琳迪坦白一切
I had no choice. I told Lindy everything.

779
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:38,816
你所有的精力 注意力
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...

780
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:40,214
...都源自一种药物
...has been a drug,

781
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:42,649
它应该是合法的
Well, it was supposed to be legal,

782
01:00:42,718 --> 01:00:46,311
我还有...一批存货
I have a... a supply stashed,

783
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:49,848
你希望我去帮你拿来
You want me to go get it,

784
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:53,378
不 不 不 我自己去拿      给我钥匙
No, No, no, no, I'm gonna go get it,        Give me your keys,

785
01:00:53,456 --> 01:00:55,115
我这就去你的公寓
I'll go to your apartment,

786
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,090
不在...我公寓里 我把它转移了
It's not... in my apartment, I moved it,

787
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:02,956
好吧 那你藏在哪里了
OK, so where did you move it?

788
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:11,813
藏在我家里
In my house,

789
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:15,173
真是不可思议
Unbelievable,

790
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:30,253
喂 你拿到了吗
Hey, have you got it?

791
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:31,883
是的
Yeah,

792
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,483
有人在跟踪我
There's someone following me,

793
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,289
你确定吗
Are you sure?

794
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,829
是的 他上了我后面那辆出租车
Yeah, He got into the cab behind me

795
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,920
从头到尾跟着我
and he's making every turn I'm making,

796
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:46,828
宝贝 报警      你能甩掉他吗
Baby, call the cops,        Can you go around him?

797
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:48,195
亲爱的 怎么了
Babe, what's happening?

798
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:50,027
堵在路上了
We're stopped dead,

799
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,732
他从车上下来了
He's getting out,

800
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:55,636
艾迪 他走过来了
Eddie, he's walking over here,

801
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,396
琳迪?
Lindy?

802
01:01:57,966 --> 01:01:59,023
我的天!
Oh, God!

803
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:17,129
救命! 救命!
Help! Help!

804
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:21,333
这个男人...他在跟踪我!
This man's... This man's chasing me!

805
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:24,933
他跟着我出了我家 可我不认识他
He followed me from my building, I don't know him,

806
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,409
拜托!      喂 老小子 别找她麻烦!
Please!        Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

807
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:33,071
你聋了吗 我说别找她麻烦!
Are you deaf? I said leave her alone,

808
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,272
喂 老小子 你这是想把我惹毛吗
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?

809
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:41,310
你在干什么 混蛋?
What are you doing, man?

810
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,868
你没挂吧      我没挂 怎么了
Are you still there?        Yeah, I'm here, What happened?

811
01:03:15,936 --> 01:03:19,097
我被困住了 他迟早找到我
I'm stuck, He'll find me,

812
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,160
好 别说话了 别动
OK, stop talking. Don't move.

813
01:03:21,238 --> 01:03:23,898
他杀了两个人      什么
He killed two guys.        What?

814
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:27,201
他也会杀了我的      不 不 不会的
He's gonna kill me, too,        No, no, no...

815
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,399
他能看见你吗
Can he see you?

816
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,631
看不见
No,

817
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:36,206
暂时还看不见
Not yet,

818
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:40,134
我不知道要怎么办才好
I don't know what to do,

819
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,906
好 我要你打开袋子吃一颗药
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills,

820
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:46,042
为什么
Why?

821
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,545
因为那样你就知道该怎么办了 吃了你就明白了
Because you'll know what to do. You'll take it and then you'll know.

822
01:03:48,614 --> 01:03:52,513
他手里有刀 艾迪 我不觉得自己能刀下逃生
He's got a knife, Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife,

823
01:03:53,716 --> 01:03:55,807
听我的话 30秒钟后药就会生效
Just listen to me, It'll come on in 30 seconds,

824
01:03:55,883 --> 01:03:57,782
然后你再思考要怎么脱身 药就有这个功效
And you'll think your way out, That's what it does,

825
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:24,852
他越走越近了
He's getting closer,

826
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:28,960
琳迪 我爱你
Lindy, I love you,

827
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,572
嗨
Hey!

828
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:41,844
现在转过来...
Now turn to me...

829
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:45,382
你要干什么!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

830
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,747
啊!      爸爸!
Ah!        Daddy!

831
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,683
艾迪 给
Eddie, Here,

832
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:04,885
没事了
It's gonna be OK,

833
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,652
我们得离开这里 艾迪?
We've got to get out of here, Eddie?

834
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:46,420
你没事吧
You OK?

835
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,686
没事
Yeah,

836
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:54,890
对于那件事我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry about what happened,

837
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,086
我希望你明白我们再也不会经历那种事了
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again,

838
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:00,923
因为我会照顾好我们俩的
'cause I can take care of us now,

839
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:03,019
我相信你可以
I'm sure you can,

840
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:05,619
我能保证我俩的安全 我又恢复了 好吗
I can make us safe, I'm back, OK?

841
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:12,194
谁恢复了 艾迪      我呀
Who's back, Eddie?        Me,

842
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:14,698
不 那不是你
No, It's not you,

843
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:18,359
你以前不是这个样子      我依旧是我 琳迪
You were different before,        I'm still the same person, Lin,

844
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,061
而我不是了 药效发作的时候
I wasn't, when I was on it,

845
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:23,428
我做出了自己平时绝对做不到的事
I did things I would never do,

846
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:26,096
那些事救了你的命      但那本不是我能做到的
Those things saved your life,        But they weren't me,

847
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,000
是的 是你做到的 药是那样发挥...
Yes, they were, No, the way it works...

848
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,271
我知道它是怎么发挥功效的
I know how it works, I get it,

849
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:33,101
我完全明白 你觉得自己所向无敌
I totally get it, You feel invincible,

850
01:07:34,374 --> 01:07:37,033
它能让我们取得多大的成功 你根本无法想象
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine,

851
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:41,565
我们能做到的事情 我们一年后能成为怎样的人
The things we'll be able to do, Where we'll be a year from now,

852
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:45,303
我们终将能过上的那种上等人的生活
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live,

853
01:07:45,377 --> 01:07:48,572
那你恐怕得独自享受了
Well, you might have to live it without me,

854
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:55,274
我会戒掉的 只是现在需要解决些事情
Look, I am gonna stop taking it, There's just some things I have to do

855
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,872
确保我俩的安全 安排好一切 然后我就会戒
to keep us safe and that... To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it,

856
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,576
我本来就是这么打算的      艾迪
I mean, that's the plan,        Eddie...

857
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,946
我真的都打算好了 我发誓
Look, I have a plan, I swear,

858
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:04,812
我会戒的
I'm gonna get off it,

859
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:07,582
好吧
OK,

860
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,109
我希望你能做到
I hope you do,

861
01:08:43,297 --> 01:08:45,196
要找我吗
Looking for me?

862
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,220
你以为你能跑掉 是吗 
You think you can run out on me, huh? 

863
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,228
你以为我不知道你躲在哪里
You think I don't know where you are?

864
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,096
我认为我们之间的生意已经做完了
I was under the impression our business was settled,

865
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:54,964
再给我些那种药
I want some more of that stuff,

866
01:08:55,035 --> 01:08:58,002
不然我就当场崩了你 自己选
Or I shoot you right here, Take your pick,

867
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,866
这家伙是打发不走的
This guy was not going away.

868
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,698
给他几片药能为我争取到时间
A few pills would buy me some time.

869
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:05,169
给 我们两清了      走着瞧吧
There it is, We're done,        Oh, yeah, We'll see,

870
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,831
直到我找到更...长久的解决办法
Until I found a more... permanent solution.

871
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:09,912
除非我真的身陷险境 
Unless you see a real threat, 

872
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,374
我不希望能察觉到自己身边有保镖
I never want it known that I have any security,

873
01:09:12,442 --> 01:09:14,270
你们不需要为我开道 只需要跟着我
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me,

874
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:18,197
永远不要远于15步 两人也不要靠得太近
Never more than 15 steps behind, And never stand too close together,

875
01:09:18,276 --> 01:09:20,971
我希望自己回头的时候还能看见你俩之间有空隙
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself,

876
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:24,673
不要穿同样颜色的西装 这不是什么黑客帝国
And don't wear the same color suit, This isn't The Matrix.

877
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:32,574
你得明白 艾迪 我把你打发了
You have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off,

878
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:34,308
我当时病了      你没资格生病
I was sick,        You don't get sick,

879
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:37,110
生意做到这份上 有口气就得上 你还没死呢
You're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die,

880
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:39,843
你说得完全正确      我知道我是对的
You're absolutely right,        I know I'm right,

881
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:41,817
我都不知道我在和谁浪费时间
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to,

882
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,114
我当时烧到40度 卡尔 神志恍惚
A hundred and five, That's who you were talking to, Carl, Delirium,

883
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:46,000
对
Mm-hm,

884
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,560
我把修改过的预测发过来了
I sent over my revised projections,

885
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,833
我没让你发什么预测
I didn't ask for your projections,

886
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,588
我明白 但只要你看过了的话...
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...

887
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:55,617
我已经看过了 事实上
I already have, As a matter of fact...

888
01:09:57,188 --> 01:10:00,383
我已经根据你的预测炒掉了一些人
...I fired a few people over your projections,

889
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:02,082
我很抱歉      不 你才没有
I'm sorry,        No, you're not,

890
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:04,988
你庆幸自己知道我的团队没留意的事
You're relieved that you know things my team missed,

891
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:09,582
这一刻 一切简直不可思议...
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...

892
01:10:12,494 --> 01:10:14,284
服用NZT两个月后
Two months after I'd started NZT,

893
01:10:14,285 --> 01:10:17,287
我主持了商业史上最大的合并计划
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.

894
01:10:17,362 --> 01:10:19,654
讽刺的是 关键在于原油 
Ironically, it's gonna be crude, 

895
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,798
原油是我们切入的最佳方位
Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them,

896
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:24,489
这部分利润高达百分之两百
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent,

897
01:10:24,564 --> 01:10:26,428
这会让每个人都喜出望外
That makes both of us very happy campers,

898
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:28,897
我发现只要保持合理摄入量
I found that if I maintained an even dose,

899
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:31,330
按时吃饭 不沾酒精
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,

900
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,798
头脑空窗期就再没发生过      你还好吧 艾迪
the blackouts didn't recur.        How you doing, Eddie?

901
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:37,735
汤姆 衣服里能加暗袋吗
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?

902
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:39,269
在这件上面吗
In this jacket?

903
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:42,769
所有衣服上面      当然可以 先生
In all of them,        Certainly, sir,

904
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:44,946
与其在这里坐吃山空 
Safer though my stash now was, 

905
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,966
不如先想办法
I was not sitting around until it ran out.

906
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,600
我能按同样的配方制作出同样的药物吗 
Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, 

907
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,371
当然可以 不过
yes, but,

908
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:55,237
它能否起到同样的作用...不好说
the exact method of delivery to the brain... Darts at a dartboard,

909
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:57,935
什么意思      还需要临床试验 在人身上试验
Meaning?        Clinical trials, guinea pig people,

910
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,533
花的时间太久了      制药就这么麻烦
That's gonna take too long,        It's what it is,

911
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:04,100
不然就是在草菅人命 需要12到18个月...
Or you'll kill people, You need 12, to 18 months...

912
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:06,405
如果你六个月里能做出来我就给你两百万
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six,

913
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:18,783
我发现我们能降低30%的成本
I found that we can cut costs 30 percent and, um...

914
01:11:22,185 --> 01:11:23,515
失陪一下
Excuse me one second,

915
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:29,246
我以为之前那事已经解决了 侦探
I thought we straightened this out, Detective,

916
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,254
这和弗农・甘特无关 莫莱先生
This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra,

917
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:35,720
那又是为了什么
What is this about?

918
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:41,122
玛利亚・温贝里案的目击证人指认这人为嫌疑犯
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person,

919
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:48,692
打算告诉我你四月二日晚上在什么地方吗
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?

920
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:52,855
我没办法再独自隐瞒下去
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.

921
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:58,554
于是我请了莫里斯・布兰特 纽约最出色的律师
Enter Morris Brandt... the most lethal lawyer in New York.

922
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:03,766
很幸运房间已经打扫过了 
You're lucky somebody wiped the room, 

923
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,228
证据薄弱 最多只能算间接旁证
It's weak, Circumstantial at best,

924
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:09,325
和我私下透个底 你那天在那里吗
Just between us, were you there?

925
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:10,628
我记不得了
I don't remember,

926
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:13,759
我无意对你们让步...
I don't want to make concessions to you...

927
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:15,894
卡尔・范隆和汉克・阿特伍德
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

928
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:19,960
都对我即将受到谋杀指控毫不知情
had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.

929
01:12:20,038 --> 01:12:22,733
但SY 艾丹这几家公司
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying

930
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,829
都正在为我们装作没有察觉到的
for the same industrial concessions in Libya

931
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,168
商业利益在利比亚大打出手
that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out,

932
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,605
你怎么知道呢
How do you know this?

933
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:32,268
自上而下收取贿赂的政府本身就腐败不堪 自然
The governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course,

934
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:35,468
内线消息 像任何东西一样 都是买得到的
information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought,

935
01:12:38,045 --> 01:12:39,443
继续
Go on,

936
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:42,910
如果你看看左下角那排 在2008年
If you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008,

937
01:12:42,979 --> 01:12:45,012
在我们留意到前
five companies were jockeying for a position 

938
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:46,414
已经有五个公司在角力了
before we even took notice,

939
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,476
老天 他看上去不堪一击
Jesus, he looks frail,

940
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:54,881
可能是装出来的      他还不到60岁
Could be an act,        He's not even 60,

941
01:12:57,218 --> 01:13:00,276
决定好了吗 艾迪 你准备怎么办
So, have you decided, Eddie? What are you gonna do?

942
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:03,444
并购结束之后? 我不知道
When this is over? I don't know,

943
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,918
你还没告诉我答案
You haven't given me the answer,

944
01:13:04,987 --> 01:13:06,851
你又没有问
You haven't asked the question,

945
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:08,682
基于我的贡献
Well, given the scale of my contribution,

946
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:11,085
45吧
let's say 45,

947
01:13:11,156 --> 01:13:14,146
成交 四千五千美元
Done, Forty-five thousand dollars,

948
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,807
四千万是一大笔钱 艾迪 
Forty million is plenty, Eddie, 

949
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:17,659
但那之后还会有更多
There's a lot more where that came from,

950
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:20,055
知道吗 艾迪
You know, Eddie...

951
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,182
也许你考虑的是
...it may be on your mind

952
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:23,658
不准备继续为我工作
that you're not gonna continue to work for me anymore,

953
01:13:23,727 --> 01:13:25,455
这是一次宝贵的学习经历
This has been the learning experience of my life,

954
01:13:25,528 --> 01:13:28,017
我希望如此 我希望你不会觉得自己已经学得够了
I hope it has, I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me,

955
01:13:28,094 --> 01:13:29,618
进入下一阶段
On to the next,

956
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,508
要发展职业生涯 我必须不断前行
Well, in order for a career to evolve, I'm gonna have to move on,

957
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,097
你想过没有这只会告诉我
That you would even think that would only show me

958
01:13:35,098 --> 01:13:37,529
你完全没有准备好独自前行
how unprepared you are to be on your own,

959
01:13:37,598 --> 01:13:39,963
我是说 你清楚认识到自己是个怪才
I mean, you do know you're a freak,

960
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:42,617
你那源于天赐 或者机遇 或者基因
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance,

961
01:13:42,633 --> 01:13:44,964
或者其他任何来源的推理能力
or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote

962
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,331
都不是你辛苦挣来的
your life script, a gift not earned,

963
01:13:47,402 --> 01:13:51,301
你不懂我明白的事因为你的能力不是磨练出来的
You do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers,

964
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,257
你对你的能力毫不珍惜
You're careless with those powers,

965
01:13:53,257 --> 01:13:54,940
你挥洒卖弄自己的能力
You flaunt them and you throw them around 

966
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:57,000
就像富二代挥霍他的遗产
like a brat with his trust fund,

967
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,505
你没有经历过一梯梯往上爬的日子
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs,

968
01:13:59,572 --> 01:14:01,669
你没有被投资人的无聊折磨过 
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers, 

969
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:02,563
你也没有为了
You haven't done the time

970
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,670
把你第一次婚姻费在做个凤凰男身上
in that first marriage to the girl with the right father,

971
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,270
你觉得自己可以轻松跨越这些阶段
You think you can leap over all in a single bound,

972
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,866
你从不需要为了一个位置使劲浑身解数
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way

973
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:11,037
去行贿 色诱 威胁 
to a seat at that table, 

974
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,139
你不知道要怎么分析你的竞争对手
You don't know how to assess your competition

975
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:16,440
因为你从未真正竞争过 别指望你有本事和我争
because you haven't competed, Don't make me your competition,

976
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,304
现在 我会给你一笔资金
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you,

977
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,438
你会想试试身手的
You'll be wanting a few toys,

978
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:43,780
住酒店已经不再是个办法
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.

979
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,878
我需要的是个堡垒
What I needed was a bunker.

980
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:48,522
有内置保险箱 中央监控系统
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance,

981
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:51,015
金库级别的空气压力门
vault grade pneumatic doors.

982
01:14:51,091 --> 01:14:54,422
绝无仅有的三层保全系统
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system,

983
01:14:54,492 --> 01:14:57,857
这是一座风景绝美的堡垒
A fortress with a hell of a view,

984
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:04,857
开价多少      八百五十万
What's the asking price?        Eight-point-five,

985
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:11,228
我买了
I'll take it,

986
01:15:16,866 --> 01:15:19,731
毫无疑问他是为NZT而来
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.

987
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,500
下周我需要20片药
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills,

988
01:15:22,535 --> 01:15:24,501
下周 你可以去见鬼
Next week, you can go fuck yourself!

989
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:26,160
不是说你会舒坦
Not that you'd feel anything,

990
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:30,797
我不认为你那些富豪朋友会喜欢
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate

991
01:15:30,871 --> 01:15:33,997
你和警察之间的那点小小纠纷的
the details of your little dilemma with the police,

992
01:15:34,973 --> 01:15:37,700
周四 药送到这里
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here,

993
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,174
变聪明了啊
Getting smarter!

994
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,066
显而易见 不能再这么继续下去
Obviously, this could not go on,

995
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:47,730
不过这世上
but there is very little on this earth 

996
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:49,305
四千万美金解决不了的事情可不多
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

997
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:53,004
明早九点钟 阿特伍德就会签字
And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.

998
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:03,338
这是怎么回事      临阵退缩?
Do you want to call it?        Cold feet?

999
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,974
现在这么说已经太晚了
There was all last night to tell us that,

1000
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:10,177
有消息吗      我马上再联系他 先生
Anything?        I'll call him again, sir.

1001
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:13,327
好吧 他可能会改主意 这也是人之常情
OK, the decision could have changed, That makes sense,

1002
01:16:13,328 --> 01:16:16,465
但一声不吭却不合理 交易还会进行
The discourtesy doesn't, It's still on,

1003
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:19,814
基于你的那些表格和预测
Oh, based on your charts and projections,

1004
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:22,982
再和我说一遍 你算哪根葱
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?

1005
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:23,851
抱歉 卡尔 
I'm sorry, Carl,

1006
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:25,786
我受够这个装腔作势 一文不名的白痴
I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick,

1007
01:16:25,858 --> 01:16:27,982
闭嘴      什么时候起这成了装神弄鬼
Pull it back,        Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

1008
01:16:28,057 --> 01:16:31,924
别说了      打扰一下 范隆先生
Pull it back,        Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

1009
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:33,608
阿特伍德夫人在你办公室等你
Mrs. Atwood is in your office,

1010
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,793
阿特伍德夫人 我是卡尔・范隆
Ah, Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon,

1011
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:41,295
我的合伙人 爱德华・莫莱      幸会
My associate, Edward Morra,        Pleasure,

1012
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:46,356
我希望此事尽力保持低调
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible,

1013
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:48,022
当然
Of course,

1014
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:51,998
我丈夫今早突然感到头痛眩晕
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning,

1015
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,692
此刻他正在勒诺克斯山医院接受检查
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests,

1016
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:57,699
我只是希望表明我们
I just want you to know we have every intention

1017
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,164
签署合同的诚意
of signing the contract,

1018
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:03,786
一旦他能够签字 我们立刻办理
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed,

1019
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,388
我知道这是老生常谈 
I realize this is a useless platitude, 

1020
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,893
但如果有什么能效劳的地方
but if there's anything that we can do,

1021
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,290
请务必不要见外
please don't hesitate to tell us,

1022
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,224
我们无疑希望表现出我们的敬意
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful

1023
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,817
阿特伍德夫人
as possible, Mrs. Atwood,

1024
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,690
谢谢 先生们 我对此深表感激
Thank you, gentlemen, I rely on your discretion,

1025
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:18,786
看样子不会有代理签字了
There won't be a proxy,

1026
01:17:18,863 --> 01:17:21,921
不会 像他这种守口如瓶的怎会放权给律师?
No, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?

1027
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:28,355
他最好尽快康复
Well, he'd better get better,

1028
01:17:31,501 --> 01:17:35,902
但是阿特伍德不会康复了 因为他没有NZT
But Atwood wouldn't get better. Because Atwood was out of NZT.

1029
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:42,962
为什么要惊讶
Well, why be surprised?

1030
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,473
还有多少一夜暴富是NZT的功劳
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?

1031
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,972
至少我是这样
At least I had some.

1032
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,166
我的生命没有受到威胁      在这里等
My life wasn't in jeopardy.        You can wait here,

1033
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:53,231
但我的财富 我的自由受到了
Only my money. And my liberty.

1034
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:56,073
我和他们谈过了
I've been all over with them,

1035
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:58,508
所有嫌疑人不允许有任何
We can't allow any disparity in race

1036
01:17:58,577 --> 01:18:01,192
人种或明显体格上的差异
or physical type between you and the rest of the line up,

1037
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:01,800
好
OK,

1038
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:04,843
我尽力找了些看着像你的克隆体的家伙
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get,

1039
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,676
目击证人绝对分不清的
It's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.

1040
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,352
谁会在那头看
Who was out there?

1041
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:27,985
被害人的丈夫吗
The woman's husband?

1042
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:30,687
酒店员工?
A hotel maid?

1043
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:35,146
我会就此完蛋吗
Was this how it was all going to end?

1044
01:18:39,491 --> 01:18:42,015
毫无头绪 他根本认不出
Not the dimmest clue, He was dithering,

1045
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:45,060
"他是从右边数第三个 不 不是他"
"He was the third one from the right, No, Not him,"

1046
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:50,561
给 这西装真棒 手工定制的?
There you go, It's a thing of beauty, You have that made?

1047
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,220
没错
I did,

1048
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:10,899
今日市场震荡
...market's been mixed today.

1049
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:13,663
道琼斯指数因范隆集团和汉克・阿特伍德
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that

1050
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:18,467
在协商合并的谣传而上下震荡
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...

1051
01:19:19,573 --> 01:19:21,334
你和谁提起过这个吗
Have you been talking to anyone?

1052
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,572
没有 谁也没提 卡尔 我又不傻
No, I haven't been talking to anybody, Carl, I'm not stupid,

1053
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:26,868
我知道你不蠢 艾迪
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

1054
01:19:26,941 --> 01:19:28,909
但不要犯所有聪明人会犯的错
but don't make the classic smart person's mistake,

1055
01:19:28,975 --> 01:19:30,839
就是以为没人能比过你
Thinking no one's smarter than you,

1056
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,022
你他妈的去哪儿了 
Where the hell have you been? 

1057
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,072
这是你第二次玩失踪了
This is the second time you've turned to vapor,

1058
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,782
哪儿也没去 就是去喝个咖啡 
I was in the building, I was getting coffee, 

1059
01:19:35,782 --> 01:19:37,010
怎么了 有新情况吗
Why, has there been movement?

1060
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:39,409
是有新情况 阿特伍德陷入昏迷
Yeah, there's been movement alright, Atwood's in a coma,

1061
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,003
他没在耍我们 他确实生命垂危
He wasn't playing us, He's dying,

1062
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:43,671
你对此有什么看法
What do you know about this?

1063
01:19:43,747 --> 01:19:47,340
我一时不知要如何作答
I was less than usually equipped to answer.

1064
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:51,781
迟钝感逐渐涌上 该再次服用NZT了
The dullness was coming on. I was overdue to take my NZT.

1065
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:55,045
我的头也开始一阵阵抽痛
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.

1066
01:19:55,118 --> 01:19:56,379
失陪一下
Excuse me,

1067
01:19:56,452 --> 01:19:57,975
我没让你走
You're not excused,

1068
01:19:58,052 --> 01:20:00,576
怎么 你的员工连洗手间也不能去吗 卡尔
What? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?

1069
01:20:23,261 --> 01:20:25,159
是布兰特还是谁干的
Was it Brandt or someone else?

1070
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:27,787
在警察局还是什么更衣间丢的?
The police station? A coatroom?

1071
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:43,097
莫莱先生
Mr. Morra,

1072
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:45,657
卡尔 抱歉...      莫莱先生 莫莱先生!
Carl, I'm sorry...        Mr. Morra, Mr. Morra!

1073
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:47,496
你的包裹 刚送到      是的 什么
This just came for you,        Yeah, what?

1074
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:56,004
希望不会 有进展通知我
Hope not, so let me know when you know,

1075
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:57,242
好 现在我准备再问你一次 艾迪 
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie, 

1076
01:20:57,242 --> 01:20:58,552
你对此有何看法
What do you know about this?

1077
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,678
什么 关于泄密吗      不 关于阿特伍德
What? About the leak?        No, About Atwood,

1078
01:21:01,905 --> 01:21:03,267
关于阿特伍德的什么
What? What about Atwood?

1079
01:21:03,267 --> 01:21:05,764
小子 你在撒谎上还嫩得很呢
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo,

1080
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:07,487
卡尔 我不知道你在...      听我说!
Carl, I don't know what you're...        Listen!

1081
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,959
我知道你接下来要说的都是废话
What you're about to say is bullshit,

1082
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:10,317
我知道你有事瞒着我
I know there's something you're hiding from me,

1083
01:21:10,318 --> 01:21:12,113
我察觉得到 现在
I smell it on you, Right now,

1084
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:15,479
我想知道为什么已经板上钉钉的生意打了水漂!
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!

1085
01:21:17,182 --> 01:21:19,206
卡尔
Carl,

1086
01:21:19,283 --> 01:21:21,272
艾迪! 艾迪!
Eddie! Eddie!

1087
01:21:37,857 --> 01:21:39,789
今天在勒诺克斯山医院外
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,

1088
01:21:39,857 --> 01:21:42,620
范隆与阿特伍德的合并出现了更多的变数
more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.

1089
01:21:42,692 --> 01:21:46,523
并购仅仅是谣传
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.

1090
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:50,381
绝对没有 我丈夫正在接受检查
None whatsoever. My husband is having tests.

1091
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:52,486
这是困难时期
This is a difficult time.

1092
01:21:52,561 --> 01:21:56,460
诸位有任何问题可以咨询我们的律师
We would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.

1093
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:58,996
目前无可奉告
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.

1094
01:21:59,064 --> 01:22:01,692
我们在等待最新检测结果
We're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests

1095
01:22:01,692 --> 01:22:03,266
并期待有奇迹发生
and hoping for the best.

1096
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,519
谢谢
Thank you.

1097
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:47,658
艾迪 我知道你在家 艾迪
Eddie, I know you're in there, Eddie,

1098
01:22:48,935 --> 01:22:51,834
开门
Open up,

1099
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:56,128
快点
Come on,

1100
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:00,270
快开门
Open the door,

1101
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:19,707
于是我就到了现在这地步
And so, here I am.

1102
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:25,174
我知道那药会一点点将我吞噬
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.

1103
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:28,374
但那至少是我的选择
But this choice would at least be mine.

1104
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:42,152
我们都是本能动物 我们想活下去
But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live.

1105
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,649
所以我混沌的大脑努力回忆
So my foggy brain tried to remember 

1106
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,712
还能在哪里再找出一片NZT
where one tablet of NZT might be.

1107
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:58,755
这仅仅是个可能 但有这个可能性也就够了
It was possible. And possible was enough.

1108
01:24:22,101 --> 01:24:23,692
你好 艾迪
Hey, Eddie,

1109
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:49,443
你知道我想要更多的药 为什么惹我生气
Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?

1110
01:24:50,778 --> 01:24:53,369
我不喜欢药快用尽的感觉
I don't like being down to this last one,

1111
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:55,378
你不懂得怎么利用它
You don't even know how to use it,

1112
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:57,811
你不会物尽其用
You don't appreciate it,

1113
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,972
你瞧 我把它溶解成液体
You see, I dissolve in a solution,

1114
01:25:01,048 --> 01:25:05,708
一旦注射 直接进入血液和大脑
You shoot it, It goes straight into the blood and brain,

1115
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:09,476
药效持久得多
Lasts much longer,

1116
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:25,914
那么
So...

1117
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,616
你现在准备告诉我剩下的药在哪里了吗
You gonna tell me where the rest is?

1118
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,351
我吃光了
I'm plumb out,

1119
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,864
给我找
Go look.

1120
01:25:34,993 --> 01:25:37,720
要知道 我的人迟早找到它
You know, these guys are gonna find it,

1121
01:25:38,894 --> 01:25:41,418
或者我逼你说出来
Or I'm gonna make you tell me,

1122
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:44,463
问题是 哪种办法会先奏效呢
Question is, which is gonna come first?

1123
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,522
我想我们会知道答案的 对吗
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?

1124
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:54,529
知道吗 你在浪费我的时间
This is a waste of my time, you know?

1125
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,533
我准备从这行洗手不干了
I'm getting out of this side of the business,

1126
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:02,297
去拓展新业务 我开了家进出口公司
I'm branching out, I'm starting import-export company,

1127
01:26:03,169 --> 01:26:04,429
非常激动人心
Very exciting stuff,

1128
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,996
我忙得很 和你耗是你的荣幸
I got a lot on my plate, You're lucky I'm here,

1129
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,940
这里有个保险箱
There's a safe.

1130
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:21,534
要在以前 我会剥了你的皮 割你的肉
Back in the old times, I might peel your skin back, Fillet you,

1131
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,371
"割肉" 这词不错
"Fillet," It's a nice word,

1132
01:26:24,443 --> 01:26:29,140
我以前不知道这词 哦 那时我的词汇量真贫乏
I didn't know this before, Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary,

1133
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:36,249
但现在我发现了个好东西 谷歌
But then I discovered this thing, Google,

1134
01:26:37,186 --> 01:26:40,744
你知道小肠和大肠一共有20英尺长吗
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?

1135
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,651
我不知道 也不相信
I had no idea, I don't believe it,

1136
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:46,553
我要眼见为实 我很多疑 这又是个新鲜词
I gotta see this for myself, I'm dubious, It's another nice word,

1137
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:50,954
无论如何 我相信你也对此感到好奇
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too,

1138
01:26:51,024 --> 01:26:53,547
别担心 都消过毒的
Don't worry, everything's sterilized,

1139
01:26:53,624 --> 01:26:56,682
结束之前都不会让你断气的
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang,

1140
01:26:56,759 --> 01:26:58,885
你可是身处最佳位置哦 艾迪
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie,

1141
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,260
怎么
What?

1142
01:27:36,307 --> 01:27:38,467
算不得什么胜利 不是吗
Not much of a triumph, was it?

1143
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,733
因为死的也有可能是我
Because I would die here, too.

1144
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,150
只有NZT能救我 
Only NZT could help me 

1145
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:47,173
而最后的药残存在这个家伙的血液之中
and the last of it was in this fuck's blood stream.

1146
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:04,064
维克多!
Victor!

1147
01:29:11,839 --> 01:29:13,466
什么
What?

1148
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:28,906
喂!
Hey!

1149
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:29,786
我看不见
I can't see.

1150
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:15,399
在你右边 开枪
On your right, shoot him.

1151
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:24,042
维克多?
Victor?

1152
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:28,548
维克多?
Victor?

1153
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:31,053
维克多?
Victor?

1154
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,767
警察事后会得知
The police would later note

1155
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:24,867
我公寓的前任主人是个军火商
that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.

1156
01:31:24,942 --> 01:31:28,263
自然 这些闯入者也是对他不满的客户
Of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.

1157
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:32,069
夜还长得很
And the night was still young.

1158
01:31:45,283 --> 01:31:47,408
我相信你肯定对你老板身上发生的事感到好奇
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss,

1159
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:48,754
至少我很好奇
I know I certainly am,

1160
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:52,349
我是说 如果我的律师真在为阿特伍德先生效力
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood,

1161
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,605
想要竭力拯救他的话 他怎么会死
trying to save his life, why is he dead?

1162
01:31:56,953 --> 01:31:59,545
怎么没见到这位忠心耿耿的下属
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in

1163
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,712
带着救命灵药飞奔而来呢
with his life-saving medication?

1164
01:32:02,755 --> 01:32:04,779
他的老板死了
His boss was dead.

1165
01:32:04,856 --> 01:32:07,074
因此我再也无关紧要
So, I didn't matter now.

1166
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:11,213
但他不满莫里斯・布兰特
But he did not appreciate that Morris Brandt 

1167
01:32:11,213 --> 01:32:13,754
独吞了药物
had kept the pills for himself.

1168
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:28,061
一切仍有挽回的余地
And it was all still possible.

1169
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,900
十二个月以后
TWELVE MONTHS LATER

1170
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:48,138
实际上 票已售罄
Actually, no, there's no more tickets,

1171
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:53,562
我明白 临时多出来的募捐人 这倒头一次
Yeah, I know, An overbooked fundraiser, That's a first,

1172
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,299
他刚好过来了 我问问他
Well, here he comes, I'll ask him,

1173
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,507
这样看上去好多了
Oh, that's much better,

1174
01:32:57,575 --> 01:32:59,371
非常好      谢谢 先生
Great job,        Thank you, sir,

1175
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,334
你好 莫莱先生
Hi, Mr. Morra,

1176
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,238
爱德华!
Edward!

1177
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:06,872
我想我们这是要有第二次人满为患的募捐晚会了
I think we're looking at a second overflow event,

1178
01:33:06,945 --> 01:33:08,934
大量捐款不断涌入 我觉得
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think

1179
01:33:09,012 --> 01:33:11,343
那些人都没怎么犹豫就决定了
they're even gonna try a second debate,

1180
01:33:11,413 --> 01:33:12,673
太好了      坚持住
Great.        Hold on,

1181
01:33:12,746 --> 01:33:14,373
EC公司的人在你办公室等你
A guy from Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office,

1182
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:16,090
我约了人吃午餐      他们是你最大的捐助人
I have a lunch,        They're your biggest contributor,

1183
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,474
好歹随便应付下
Give him his two crappy little minutes,

1184
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:19,946
EC制药?      对
Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?        Yeah,

1185
01:33:21,816 --> 01:33:24,510
终于见到了维持这一切运转的功臣
Finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on,

1186
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,814
卡尔!      莫莱先生
Carl!        Mr. Morra,

1187
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:32,775
真是意外 他们告诉我来的是EC公司的人
What a surprise, They told me somebody from Eiben was coming,

1188
01:33:32,854 --> 01:33:34,090
EC公司 没错 那现在是我的公司 
Chemcorp, Yeah, that's me now, 

1189
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,220
我在渐渐退出能源市场
I'm moving out of the energy business,

1190
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:40,016
拜托 这就像海夫纳离开"花花公子"杂志一样
Come on, That's like Hef moving out of the mansion,

1191
01:33:40,089 --> 01:33:41,615
几个月前我买下了EC公司 
Yeah, I bought Eiben a couple of months ago, 

1192
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:43,319
你竟然没听说这事
I'm surprised you didn't hear,

1193
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:47,449
没有 没有 他们让我忙得团团转
No, No, Well, they really keep me hopping here,

1194
01:33:47,525 --> 01:33:50,321
这一切都是有回报的 莫莱议员
Well, it's gonna pay off, Senator Morra,

1195
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:54,057
参议院 谁知道呢...
The Senate, Who knows...

1196
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:57,458
以后又会有何发展 艾迪
Everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

1197
01:33:58,129 --> 01:34:02,688
我们都知道未来的方向 只要你能维持现状
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain,

1198
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,726
你想过药用完了之后要怎么办吗
Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?

1199
01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:26,883
你啥时候知道的      有关系吗 反正我知道了
When did you know?        Does it matter? I know now,

1200
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:29,903
我真希望你来找的是我 艾迪 
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie, 

1201
01:34:29,903 --> 01:34:31,941
我本可以用33块一股的价格收购EC的
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share,

1202
01:34:31,941 --> 01:34:33,439
我们本可以成为合作伙伴
We could have been partners,

1203
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:39,040
NZT是EC制造的
So, Eiben makes NZT,

1204
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:41,977
官方记录上没有这条
Well, it'll never officially exist,

1205
01:34:41,978 --> 01:34:44,501
显然我不需要再指出这对你有什么好处
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you,

1206
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:46,934
我想你也许需要
Oh, I think maybe you do,

1207
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:50,945
给你无限供应 我们都知道你别处弄不到了
Limitless supply, We know you can't get any more,

1208
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:52,537
你确定?
You sure about that?

1209
01:34:52,615 --> 01:34:54,410
他们今早刚刚关闭了你的实验室
They shut down your lab this morning,

1210
01:34:56,949 --> 01:35:00,473
艾迪 我只是想帮你 仅此而已
Eddie, I just want to help you, that's all,

1211
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:03,540
为你提供源源不断的药物
Keep you supplied, No disruption in service,

1212
01:35:03,618 --> 01:35:05,676
让你能安心做事 仅此而已
Give you peace of mind, That's all,

1213
01:35:07,353 --> 01:35:10,344
作为回报 我需要做什么
And in return, I do what?

1214
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:14,253
听从点建议 也许吧 一开始我不会成天来打扰你
Get a little advice, maybe, I won't be bothering you much at first,

1215
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:16,788
但之后呢 你会拿什么样的事来找我
And later, What are you gonna be bothering me with?

1216
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:18,423
既然谈到你奋斗的方向 
Well, given where you're heading, 

1217
01:35:18,423 --> 01:35:20,552
某些主意可能会有点激进
some of our ideas are a bit ambitious,

1218
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,488
但是 我认为都是可以实现的
But hey, I think they're achievable,

1219
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:24,320
如果我不喜欢你的主意怎么办
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1220
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:26,791
那我们就会说 "祝你成功"
Then we'll say, "Godspeed,"

1221
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:30,349
然后你的生命之烛也许就要风雨飘摇了
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light,

1222
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,717
但听我说 艾迪 我们
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even

1223
01:35:33,796 --> 01:35:34,784
现在还是不谈这么远
go there right now,

1224
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:38,159
现在 我希望让你保持智慧
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...

1225
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:41,959
...健康 来吧 我们一起去吃个饭
...and healthy, Come on, Let's go get some lunch,

1226
01:36:00,204 --> 01:36:02,171
你先请 议员
After you, Senator,

1227
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:05,604
谢谢你来拜访 卡尔
Thanks for stopping by, Carl,

1228
01:36:06,506 --> 01:36:08,269
给我们一点时间
Give us a second,

1229
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,035
你这是在干嘛 你想成为美国总统
What are you doing? Do you want to be President of the United States

1230
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:13,803
还是想变成植物人?      我倒愿意碰碰运气
or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?        I'll take my chances,

1231
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,890
我说过你没机会的 我们关闭了你的实验室
I told you your chances don't exist, We shut down your lab,

1232
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:18,371
你难道没想过狡兔三窟
You don't think some smartass on NZT

1233
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,071
我可能有不止一个实验室?
might have two or three or even four labs?

1234
01:36:20,145 --> 01:36:21,605
那又怎样 你再也生产不出来了
So what? You're not making any more,

1235
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:22,305
没错 我没再生产了
That's right, I'm not,

1236
01:36:22,305 --> 01:36:24,437
我有更好的办法 一旦你知道了它的成分
I thought better of it, See, once you know what's in it,

1237
01:36:24,513 --> 01:36:28,139
你可以调整 重制它 消除缺陷 减少用量
you can tweak it, re-engineer it, Get the bugs out, Taper off,

1238
01:36:28,848 --> 01:36:30,178
我完全戒了 卡尔
I'm off it, Carl,

1239
01:36:30,248 --> 01:36:31,509
戒或者没戒
Well, on it or off it,

1240
01:36:31,582 --> 01:36:33,879
都不意味着你不能为我工作
there's no scenario where you're not working for me,

1241
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,472
你怎么报偿我 用香烟吗
How you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?

1242
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,710
去年一年
Last year you traded

1243
01:36:36,784 --> 01:36:38,751
你就交易了17次内幕情报      你在威胁我吗
inside information 17 times,        You threatening me?

1244
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:40,941
在迪拜开空头支票 往智利扔工业垃圾 
Blank checks from Dubai, Dumping in Chile, 

1245
01:36:40,942 --> 01:36:41,945
导致官员失踪
Disappeared officials,

1246
01:36:41,946 --> 01:36:42,900
我说 你简直是站在风口浪尖了...
I mean, you shed a spot light...

1247
01:36:42,901 --> 01:36:44,095
你想和我开战吗
Do you want to go to war with me?

1248
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,320
你给我听清楚 我不打算扯远
And trust me when I say this, I'm not even being creative,

1249
01:36:46,321 --> 01:36:48,288
但你没有任何可能在做出这么多指控之后
There's no way you can be making accusations like that

1250
01:36:48,355 --> 01:36:50,491
还能全身而退
and be walking around alive,

1251
01:36:50,755 --> 01:36:52,127
这就表明了你找我对阵时
That you would even think that shows me 

1252
01:36:52,127 --> 01:36:53,409
准备有多么不充分
how unprepared you are to fight me,

1253
01:36:53,423 --> 01:36:54,603
你已经没有和我对着干的资本了
You're no longer equipped to fight me,

1254
01:36:54,604 --> 01:36:56,347
我也许已经脱瘾了 但你觉得我什么也没学到吗 
I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything? 

1255
01:36:56,348 --> 01:36:57,523
我的神经元没有进化?
That my synapses didn't change?

1256
01:36:57,524 --> 01:36:58,822
我什么也没学到?
That I kept absolutely nothing?

1257
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:00,600
你不晓得我会是个多么可怕的敌人
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be,

1258
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:03,752
那辆货车会追那辆出租车的尾      什么
That van's gonna rear-end that taxi,        What?

1259
01:37:03,752 --> 01:37:06,187
那司机在走神 他在发短信 时速是30英里/小时
The driver's distracted, He's texting, He's going 30 miles an hour,

1260
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,128
需要提前60英尺刹车 没有足够减速空间
He has 60 feet to stop, He doesn't have room,

1261
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:09,924
什么货车
What van?

1262
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:14,628
我无所不知 卡尔
I see everything, Carl,

1263
01:37:14,697 --> 01:37:16,888
我比任何人都看得更长远
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else,

1264
01:37:16,889 --> 01:37:19,395
你凭什么认为我不会让人此刻正用枪指着你
What makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?

1265
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,194
你怎么知道你明年这会儿还活着
How do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?

1266
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:24,427
你在干什么 放手 你在干什么
What are you doing? You get your hands off me, What are you doing?

1267
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,421
心跳有杂音 
Something's pumping half-mass in there, 

1268
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:27,696
心脏壁肿大
The walls of your heart are dilated,

1269
01:37:27,696 --> 01:37:30,530
主动脉瓣狭小 需要进行换心手术
Your aortic valve's steno, So you're gonna need to get that replaced,

1270
01:37:32,303 --> 01:37:33,930
但你已经知道了
But you already knew that,

1271
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:41,602
你该为此感到庆幸
You know, you should really be glad about this,

1272
01:37:41,673 --> 01:37:44,697
让我为你工作? 你迟早被我玩弄于股掌之间
'Cause me working for you? You'd end up as my bitch,

1273
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:59,407
也许我们都该冷静下 然后再谈
Maybe we should cool off, Talk again,

1274
01:38:01,247 --> 01:38:03,110
我可不这么认为
I don't think so,

1275
01:38:04,715 --> 01:38:05,942
别忘了投票
Don't forget to vote,

1276
01:38:14,252 --> 01:38:15,683
爱德华
Edward,

1277
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:17,378
你没事吧
You good?

1278
01:38:17,453 --> 01:38:20,420
没事 告诉过你我约了人吃饭
Yeah, Told you I have a lunch,

1279
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:28,720
抱歉我迟到了      没关系
Sorry I'm late,        Hey, Don't worry,

1280
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:33,314
今天过得如何      好多了
How's your day going?        Ah, I've had better,

1281
01:38:35,191 --> 01:38:37,182
我还是不习惯你的新发型
I still can't deal with that haircut,

1282
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,351
走在街上都认不出来了
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street,

1283
01:38:39,427 --> 01:38:41,189
我改头换面了
Well, I'm a new man,

1284
01:38:42,495 --> 01:38:43,518
我已经点过菜了
I've already ordered,

1285
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,200
(这段疑似中文的对话请大家自行想象)

1286
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,094
怎么
What?

1287
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:21,800
