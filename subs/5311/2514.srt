1
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,658
Obviously, I miscalculated a few things.

2
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:08,664
Eddie! I know you're in there!

3
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:17,861
Why is it that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams...

4
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,497
The access code you have entered...

5
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,870
The knife appears at your back?

6
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,238
The access code you have entered is invalid...

7
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,742
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

8
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:53,316
I will never let them touch me.

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,228
My neighbor, who must have opened his door to complain.

10
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,791
You're gonna be next, Eddie! We're coming in!

11
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:18,636
For a guy with a four digit IQ, I must have missed something.

12
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,603
And I hadn't missed much.

13
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,528
I'd come this close to having an impact on the world.

14
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:28,464
And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on...

15
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,486
...was the sidewalk.

16
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,898
You see that guy?

17
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,937
That was me, not so long ago.

18
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,930
What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way?

19
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,764
Only a writer. Strangely enough,

20
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,567
nobody believed that I actually had a book contract.

21
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,302
Well, it's masquerading as a sci-fi novel,

22
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,069
but it's really, uh, my own personal manifesto

23
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,778
about the plight of the individual in the 21st century.

24
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:14,372
I sort of created a utopian society

25
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,673
where we all sort of... Uh... Uh...

26
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:19,473
It's really... it's really...

27
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,236
Uh...

28
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,707
Today was the day I was gonna kick its ass.

29
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:32,806
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go...

30
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,979
It was gonna be great.

31
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:39,684
Just gotta put in the time. Stay in the room.

32
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:42,728
That's the key concept.

33
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,932
Don't leave the room.

34
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:56,111
A few weeks passed this way.

35
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,516
Maybe a few months.

36
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,648
At least I still had Lindy.

37
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,480
Just like that?

38
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:14,921
Come on, Eddie, This is hardly a surprise,

39
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,459
I'm surprised,

40
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,727
Let's just not do this, OK? Let me...

41
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,489
I'm gonna hand in 90 pages to Marla on Friday,

42
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,050
If you just wait to see what she says...

43
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,323
Eddie,

44
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,625
What?        I know how it's going,

45
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:29,455
I'm your...

46
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,491
I was your girlfriend,

47
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,997
That word doesn't even begin to describe what you are to me,

48
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:39,465
Partner? Squeeze?

49
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,433
Paramour, Inamorata,

50
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:45,697
Cleaning lady, Bank,

51
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,166
Thanks, Be right back,

52
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:50,636
Be that a...

53
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,035
What's mine is yours, too,

54
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,504
and you know I want to share the rest of my life with you,

55
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,732
I was thinking that we should...        Don't propose,

56
00:05:58,674 --> 00:05:59,662
Why not?

57
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,800
Because it worked out so well for you last time,

58
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,002
It's true, I did marry once. Right out of college, to Melissa.

59
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,304
I do,

60
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:09,366
Briefly.

61
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:11,539
This isn't working,

62
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,998
Well, even though everything you say is true, I still love you,

63
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,870
I gotta get back to work,

64
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,071
You didn't even tell me what happened,

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,500
I got it,        You did?

66
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,870
Mm-hm, I'm an editor,

67
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,374
I'll have my own assistant, Can you believe that?

68
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,073
Yeah, of course I believe it, You deserve it,

69
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,602
Thanks,

70
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,143
OK,        OK,

71
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,810
She was right. Why stick it out?

72
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,741
I had clearly missed the on-ramp.

73
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,247
We both knew what was beckoning.

74
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,581
The lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Jersey.

75
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:10,244
My father happy to welcome me into the challenging field

76
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,377
of dental supply inventory.

77
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,213
Eddie Morra,

78
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,584
Of all the useless relationships better forgotten

79
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,178
and put away in mothballs,

80
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,223
is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in-law?

81
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,587
Holy shit, man,

82
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,590
What has it been? Like nine years?

83
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:28,886
God!        Hey,

84
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,586
You all right? You look like you're living on the streets,

85
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,648
What's going on?

86
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,857
Not much, I... Well... What am I... What's up?

87
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,020
Uh, I'm writing, Writing a lot,

88
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,722
Oh, you're still trying to write?

89
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,019
Matter of fact, I have a book contract,

90
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,924
Really?        Yeah,

91
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,487
That's great,        How about you?

92
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,997
Are you still dealing, Vern?

93
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,363
Do I look like I'm still dealing?        No, you don't, No,

94
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,697
Come on, let's go get a drink, I want to hear about this book,

95
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,696
I don't know, It's 2:00 in the afternoon,

96
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,236
When has that ever stopped you?

97
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,061
So,        So...

98
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,799
How's Melissa doing?

99
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:08,533
Here you go,        Thanks,

100
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:12,768
Wouldn't know, I don't see her, She moved upstate,

101
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:15,790
She got some kind of Internet home sales kind of job,

102
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,845
Couple kids,

103
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,443
Couple kids, Who's the husband?

104
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:25,037
He walked out on her, if you really want to know,

105
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,544
But what do you care, man?

106
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,813
You were married, like, five minutes,

107
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,814
Look, I don't wanna talk about her, I wanna talk about you, OK?

108
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:35,678
Tell me about this book, How's it going?

109
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,912
Well, it's, uh...

110
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,382
I'm... I'm...

111
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,314
I'm behind, I'm behind on my book,

112
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,749
And, uh, it's pretty well polluting my days and nights,

113
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,649
if you really want to know,

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,176
Well, how much have you written of it?        Not one word,

115
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,688
Creative problems, huh?        Yeah, Mm-hm,

116
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,557
Well, I suppose I can help you with that,

117
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,318
Just this once,

118
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,987
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

119
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,548
You don't even know what it is,        You're still dealing,

120
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,220
Brother, I am light years from that now,

121
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:15,422
I've been doing, uh, some consulting for a pharmaceutical company,

122
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,422
What, like some offshore lab making fake Viagra?

123
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,259
Come on, Vern,

124
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,196
No, This is an exclusive product that's coming on stream next year,

125
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,131
They've had clinical trials and it's FDA approved,

126
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,127
All right, just out of curiosity and that's all...

127
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,466
Let's see it,

128
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,593
What's in it?

129
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,532
They've identified these receptors in the brain

130
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:42,400
that activate specific circuits,

131
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:46,133
And you how they say that we can only access 20 percent of our brain?

132
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:51,298
Well, what this does... it lets you access all of it,

133
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,082
Vern, look at me, Do I look good to you?

134
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,974
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass,

135
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,566
I don't think that my life's gonna take some sudden upswing

136
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,884
into fame and fortune by taking some shiny, brand-new designer drug,

137
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:02,969
Gant,

138
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,076
When?

139
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,171
Tell him we can't do that, No, you tell him,

140
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,242
No, now,

141
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:17,481
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you here, Eddie,

142
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,211
But I really... I really do want to do this again,

143
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,582
So, call me, And, uh, that's on the house,

144
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:25,885
I don't want it,

145
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:29,181
Don't be ungrateful, You know how much that costs?

146
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,881
Eight hundred bucks, A pop,

147
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,144
You're welcome,

148
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,718
All the way home, I thought about Melissa.

149
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,121
How could she be a failure, too? She'd been so smart.

150
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:55,087
Smarter than anyone around her.

151
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,562
Clearly, there was a direct link between this Eddie,

152
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,723
slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie...

153
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,833
...vomiting on his boss's desk or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.

154
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,592
So who could blame Lindy for dumping me?

155
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:21,676
In the end, how much worse could it get?

156
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,155
I didn't want to see anybody.

157
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,097
Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.

158
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,497
Valerie, Tuesday,        Look, Enough, OK?

159
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,864
Steve handles the rent, so you can feed your crap to him,

160
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,868
I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her.

161
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,732
I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.

162
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,201
Like the rent's not low enough!

163
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,964
I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon

164
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,766
about what this drug would do.

165
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,432
You could even be a bike messenger and come up with that, Really,

166
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,803
What if it was a hallucinogen?        It's pathetic,

167
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,238
Oh, my God. Listening to her rag...

168
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,002
If I were tripping, I'd jump out a fucking window.

169
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:03,235
Hello? Are you listening to me?

170
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,334
Do you get it? You are gonna be out on the streets!

171
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,173
And then, I felt it.

172
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:41,416
I was blind, but now I see.

173
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,986
...running away! You can't even look at me, you know why?

174
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,291
Because you're not even a man, You're not even a man!

175
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,727
You don't have rent! You don't have a job!

176
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:18,194
What's wrong?        What?

177
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,758
You don't like me and I don't blame you, You see a self-defeating,

178
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,530
energy-sucking piece of shit who's sponging off your husband,

179
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,968
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out,

180
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,937
but my existence shouldn't make you this upset, What is it?

181
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,667
That's none of your business,        Something wrong at law school?

182
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,138
How do you know I'm in law school?

183
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,833
People who aren't, usually don't carry around dry,

184
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,431
academically-constipated books about a dead Supreme Court justice,

185
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,506
You're a creep, aren't you? You've been... You've been following me,

186
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:43,634
No, I just noticed the book,        You just saw the corner of it,

187
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,075
How did you know that?

188
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:48,237
I'd seen it before. Twelve years ago in college.

189
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,608
Sitting on the couch of a TA I was trying to make,

190
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,408
waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom,

191
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,470
hoping she'd have a condom.

192
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:57,106
Somehow my unconscious had served that up.

193
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,705
A memory I had never even recorded.

194
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:02,512
Or was it there the whole time and all I needed was the access?

195
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,709
If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use,

196
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,581
Well, who asked you?

197
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,983
Hastings has his oral history,

198
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:08,687
I'd start there,

199
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,744
Interesting point, Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

200
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,184
which sort of gives credence to the theory

201
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:13,243
that one of the clerks he had fired

202
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:15,480
actually wrote most of this guy's major opinions,

203
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,996
You could Google the clerk's sons,

204
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:17,954
they'd love to talk to you,

205
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:18,924
Exonerate their dad,

206
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,651
That'd give you something that no one else has...

207
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:23,486
Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article,

208
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,582
some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes,

209
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,115
mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.

210
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:35,025
She didn't have a chance.        So, what are your suggestions?

211
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:42,091
We'd really worked on her paper, too.

212
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,304
In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.

213
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,492
She was pleased.

214
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:56,498
Home. But it couldn't be my home, could it?

215
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:58,802
Who would live like this?

216
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,961
My first thought was Torch it.

217
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,681
But saner heads prevailed.

218
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,603
What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it,

219
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,966
I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours, hadn't eaten,

220
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,540
so... abstemious and tidy?

221
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:52,064
What was this? A drug for people who wanted to be more anal retentive?

222
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,974
I wasn't high, I wasn't wired. Just clear.

223
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:57,533
I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.

224
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:40,726
The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain.

225
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:44,352
No surge of brilliance came up to greet me.

226
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:50,991
In short... I was back.

227
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,598
But, something remained.

228
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:02,722
You're kidding,

229
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,794
No,        Words have appeared on paper,

230
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,859
Yes,        Written by you,

231
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,335
All you have to do is read three pages,

232
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:14,462
Just read three pages in the next hour and...

233
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,096
...if you don't want to keep reading, I'll give you back the advance,

234
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,230
OK,

235
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,836
OK, Eddie,        OK,

236
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,751
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.

237
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:01,446
Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in. Call me.

238
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:04,682
It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.

239
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:08,519
OK, how did you do this?

240
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,718
I'd really like... Just call me the minute you get in. Call. OK?

241
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,993
Who is it?        Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie,

242
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:37,556
Eddie who?        Uh, Morra,

243
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,027
It's not a good time, Eddie,

244
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,227
Uh, hey, Vern, I really just need to talk to you,

245
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,431
Hey... Oh...

246
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:55,098
Vern, what happened?        Don't worry about it, I'm fine,

247
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,073
So, Eddie, You are interested after all,

248
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,596
That stuff's amazing,

249
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,701
Works better if you're already smart,

250
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,437
Vern, who did this to you?

251
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,443
Trust me, you don't want to know,

252
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,874
Uh...

253
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:15,969
So, uh, what's it called?        Doesn't have a street name yet,

254
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:19,844
But the boys in the kitchen are calling it NZT 48,

255
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:23,143
"The boys in the kitchen"? I don't...

256
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:26,614
That doesn't sound very FDA-approved, Vern,

257
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,800
FDA-approved, that's a laugh,

258
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,345
You didn't really believe that shit, did ya?

259
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,377
OK, so what do we have here?

260
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,614
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug

261
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,051
scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere

262
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:44,487
given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years.

263
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,422
So you want some more?        Yes, Definitely,

264
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,392
All right, we'll talk about it, but I, uh, need a favor first,

265
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,654
Obviously, I'm in no condition to go out right now, so,

266
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,774
I was wondering if you could pop down

267
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:02,391
to the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me,

268
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:06,829
And maybe grab a little... A little breakfast for us,

269
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,060
He knew he had me.

270
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:11,821
Sure,

271
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,763
From now on, I'd happily be his errand boy.

272
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:20,131
Wash his windows, scrub his toilet...

273
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,964
...anything I could do to get my hands on that little clear pill

274
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,128
that would bring back... Enhanced Eddie.

275
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,132
Vern?

276
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,007
Vern?

277
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,814
Oh, Vern,

278
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,227
Hey, hey!

279
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,421
Hey!

280
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:02,427
911, what's your emergency?        Hi, I need to report a...

281
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,936
...a murder,

282
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,865
7B, yes,

283
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,163
OK, I won't,

284
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:20,268
Took them forever. And the longer I stood there, the clearer I saw.

285
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,435
Vern had known whoever had done this.

286
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,371
And one guess what they'd been looking for.

287
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,709
But had they found it?

288
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,220
Shit, if you ever cooked, I'd be dead, too,

289
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,533
Police Department! Open the door, please!

290
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,941
Police Department! Open the door!

291
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:06,411
Open the door, please!

292
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,939
Police! Open the door!

293
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,947
Let's go! Open the door!

294
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:14,346
Let me see your hands,        Hey,

295
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,382
Let me see your hands!        No, no, I'm the one who called!

296
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,882
I called you guys!

297
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,781
So, you guys tight? Hang out a lot?

298
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,165
No, my ex-wife's brother,

299
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,753
I just actually ran into him on the street

300
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:29,445
and he asked me to come up to...

301
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:30,816
Buy some drugs?

302
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,254
No, no, What?        What did this guy do?

303
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:37,653
He... Uh, I don't know, He was, um...

304
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:40,351
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?

305
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:44,056
A dealer?        Yeah, uh, antiques, Um...

306
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:47,184
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...

307
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,026
...chairs and stuff,

308
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:52,789
Like, you know, like curlicue leg things,

309
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:53,954
Yeah?

310
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,020
That is correct, An Edward Morra,

311
00:24:58,098 --> 00:24:59,428
He's here,

312
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,024
Victim's sister,

313
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,629
I hadn't heard her voice in ten years.

314
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,096
Eddie?        Melissa?

315
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,734
You were there?        Um...

316
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:17,896
Just before, I had run into him on the street and, uh... yeah,

317
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,767
Oh, God.

318
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,169
I wish I was more surprised. He was involved in some stuff.

319
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,473
I'd better not say any more.

320
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,735
No, no, that's probably a good idea,

321
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:33,367
So, uh... We should probably, uh, meet or something, right?

322
00:25:33,443 --> 00:25:37,113
No, I gotta do the funeral and God knows what else.

323
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:38,174
I just...

324
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,438
We can't meet, OK?

325
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:41,910
Right, Well, I'll just...

326
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,308
I guess I'll just see you at the funeral then,

327
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,277
No. I don't want that. Please don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?

328
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,371
When this is over.        OK, all right,

329
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,675
OK.

330
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:59,809
You know, something doesn't gel here,

331
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:03,512
Write down your number, I may need to contact you later,

332
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:38,430
Worth the risk?

333
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,666
What would you do?

334
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:20,064
Vern's cash, combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation,

335
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,772
enabled me to finish the book in four days.

336
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,138
A tablet a day

337
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:37,648
and what I could do with my day was limitless.

338
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,081
I learned to play the piano in three days.

339
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,943
Math became useful.

340
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:46,978
And fun.

341
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,645
I'm all in,

342
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,855
Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent.

343
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,882
So that Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?

344
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,716
There's no arguing with you,

345
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:12,392
This was great.

346
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:15,553
So, Mom, I've been doing a little research on Aunt Helen's tumor,

347
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,147
And it's totally clear that

348
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:19,000
anybody with familial adenomatous polyposis

349
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,427
should be supplementing platinum-based doublet regiments

350
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:22,976
with eicosapentaeonic acid,

351
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,758
I suddenly knew everything. About everything.

352
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:27,236
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,

353
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,220
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

354
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,629
devalue that stock completely in two years?

355
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:30,840
No, because there are safeguards,

356
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,227
Against aggressive over-expansion?

357
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:34,633
There aren't, Because there are no safeguards in human nature,

358
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,227
We're wired to overreach,

359
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,532
Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world,

360
00:28:38,604 --> 00:28:40,093
Portugal with this big massive navy,

361
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,968
All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms,

362
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,027
And the Brits?

363
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,302
Now they're just sitting on a dank little island

364
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:45,243
fussing over their suits,

365
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,134
No one's stopping and thinking,

366
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,000
"Hey, we're doing pretty well,

367
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,490
We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account,

368
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,252
You know what? Let's not invade Russia in the winter,

369
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:54,072
Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest,"

370
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:55,609
Yeah,

371
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,005
My brain was just pouring this stuff out.

372
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,244
Everything I had ever read, heard, seen

373
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:01,932
was now organized and available.

374
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,904
Here it is. Here you go.

375
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,812
Eddie, Hey, Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio,

376
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:10,076
but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you,

377
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,547
OK, Kevin,

378
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,346
I made some new friends who invited me to the beach.

379
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,233
The beach was not nearby.

380
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,421
All my fear, all my shyness, gone.

381
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,358
They've done four basic trials...

382
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,854
But mere lounging wasn't enough.

383
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,028
Only problem? If I wasn't moving forward,

384
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,369
I felt like I was going to explode.

385
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,600
Come up here because it's beautiful, right?

386
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:14,539
Anybody ever jump?        Are you crazy?

387
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,943
He's gonna do it,        He's not gonna do it,

388
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,035
Oh, my God!

389
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,705
Oh!

390
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,576
Ah!

391
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:44,710
And then I began to form an idea.

392
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:47,218
Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.

393
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,879
It wasn't writing. It wasn't books.

394
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:51,978
It was much bigger than that.

395
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:56,620
But it would take money to get there.

396
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,183
In a down market, no one was making much.

397
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,690
But no one had NZT.

398
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,987
In an optimistic scenario,

399
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,890
gains of that nature merely would reflect

400
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,860
growth in the economy and would not pose an obstacle...

401
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:23,694
Armed with Vern's last $800, I made 2,000 in a day.

402
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,097
Next day, 7,500.

403
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:29,565
It was too slow. I'd need more capital.

404
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,598
But banks weren't lending to guys like me.

405
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:33,658
Hey, Liev,

406
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:36,225
That's your man in the corner back there,

407
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,564
Yeah,

408
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:54,662
So, uh, Liev told you that I'm looking for a short-term loan?

409
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,634
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it,

410
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:58,191
Why?

411
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,363
Because I don't see you before and I don't fucking like you already,

412
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:05,404
Why do I give you $100,000?

413
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,035
Because...

414
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:12,600
...I quintupled my money four days in a row,

415
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:14,641
So you got a fix on the game,

416
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,470
No, not a fix,

417
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,940
I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms,

418
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,442
If you look at column four, this was the first...

419
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,869
You're good,

420
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,302
OK, it's a fix,

421
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:33,438
Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,

422
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:34,481
What are you gonna do then?

423
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:38,405
Well, it's not as if I have a black book with your name in it,

424
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,269
if that's what you're talking about,

425
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,603
And besides, I get the strong feeling

426
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,540
that you're not somebody I want to disappoint,

427
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,168
Don't get up, I said don't get up,

428
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,575
Sit down!        Hey, OK,

429
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:58,808
OK, you take this, you mine,        OK,

430
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,506
You understand? You don't pay, you know what we do?

431
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,605
I cut you at waist,

432
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,479
Peel your skin up over your head and tie knot in it,

433
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,949
You don't die from this, You suffocate,

434
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:13,382
OK,        Good luck,

435
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,152
My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage

436
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:28,122
two and a half times your cash at the day trading firm.

437
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,054
I'd been upping the dose for over a week.

438
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,917
It seemed to cut my learning curve.

439
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:52,196
Why are you buying that? The CEO was just indicted,

440
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:55,097
But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into,

441
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,598
That's still on, Should be announced next week,

442
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,566
I was jacked in. Booted up.

443
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,431
At the end of the week, my brokerage account

444
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:04,560
contained over two million dollars.

445
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,469
Word quickly got out.

446
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:16,329
You have 19 messages.

447
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:18,896
Four job offers, my bank raising my line of credit,

448
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,634
a reporter from the New York Post,

449
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,641
Really call me back, Mr. Morra.

450
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,175
No one makes money that fast.

451
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:26,709
This article's gonna get written with or without you.

452
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:29,903
And finally, Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.

453
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,740
Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss

454
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:34,404
and, well, the impossible happened, bud.

455
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,311
We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.

456
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,871
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

457
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,609
Apparently so,        But you're not in the finance game,

458
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,309
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

459
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,249
Since when do you speak Italian?

460
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,849
Oh, Self-improvement month,

461
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,017
I guess somebody gave me a wake up call,

462
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:16,293
I hope you didn't do it for me,

463
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:18,486
No, I just wanted to apologize to you, Lin,

464
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:23,287
And let you know that apparently my capacity for self-sabotage

465
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:25,353
wasn't boundless after all,

466
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:29,395
The real question is, why did you ever put up with me?

467
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,492
I was in love with you,

468
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,793
So, when does the book come out?

469
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,768
Next year, How's your new assistant?

470
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:44,530
She's good,        Good,

471
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,935
Yeah,        Yeah,

472
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,429
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...

473
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,473
You know... I'm really happy you're here with me,

474
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:01,876
I'm proud of you, And...

475
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:09,583
...a little intimidated,

476
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:13,320
We started up again.

477
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:17,892
Her place.

478
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,127
My place.

479
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,167
Basically every place.

480
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,029
"In a sizzling three days of trading,

481
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,935
the unknown Mr. Morra trumped the market,

482
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,904
prompting one top hedge fund manager to comment:

483
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:41,838
'He's Houdini, He's a prophet of our times,"'

484
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:42,895
OK, give me that, Give me that!

485
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:45,601
"He's God"?        You coming over later?

486
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:48,504
I can't, I don't have a key,

487
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:49,531
Oh, that's right,

488
00:36:50,716 --> 00:36:54,115
Can I have it back?        Uh... Nope,

489
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:56,047
No?        I mean, does it have to be that key?

490
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:57,947
Can it be a new key?

491
00:36:58,611 --> 00:36:59,745
To our place?

492
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:06,486
It would be cost effective,        And you say I'm not practical,

493
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:19,451
Can I walk you to work?

494
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:38,526
Whatcha doing, hon?

495
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,059
Nothing,

496
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,064
You should sleep,

497
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,766
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?

498
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:06,230
Eddie?

499
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:08,138
Are you OK?

500
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:12,535
What are you doing out here?

501
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:19,144
When's the last time you ate something?

502
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:30,478
There he is, Nice article in the Post, buddy,

503
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:35,143
OK, he is on his way,

504
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:38,545
Now, be warned, He's mercurial,

505
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,092
One minute, your best friend,

506
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,300
the next, you're a leper,

507
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,789
And he needs direct answers,

508
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,182
Anything tentative and you've lost him forever,

509
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,915
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios,

510
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:51,750
I'm eating, Kevin,

511
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,951
Hey, are you up for this?

512
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:57,215
You sure? 'Cause I got a little bit on the line here,

513
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,384
Have a toast point,

514
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,960
It's Carl Van Loon,        That's Carl Van Loon,

515
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,017
He's worth a fortune,

516
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:08,290
Hey, John,        Hey, Carl, Good to see you,

517
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,919
How are ya?        Eddie,

518
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,465
So, Eddie Morra,

519
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,557
What's your secret?        Medication,

520
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,328
I'm on special medication,

521
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:26,391
OK,

522
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,932
Well, it's a formula with a complex method,

523
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,436
But, of course, research was a component, Massive research,

524
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,563
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in every company I bought,

525
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,265
Papers stacked like the Himalayas in my office, and you know what?

526
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,500
The stocks went up,        By a hair,

527
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:44,736
Sure, the stocks rose, but who wants to do all that work

528
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,365
for a shitty little uptake?

529
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:47,616
It's not the visceral kind of spike you want

530
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,604
in short term holdings so...

531
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,371
...I dispensed with all the hard statistics

532
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,740
and I went right to the rumor mill,

533
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:54,451
So you bought your stocks based on what?

534
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,155
The tom-toms beating in the street?

535
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,536
Sure, Share prices aren't really based on how a company works,

536
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,103
It's about how mass psychology works,

537
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,409
So, if I found certain algorithms in the perception of the stock...

538
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:05,993
Pattern recognition, That's your snake oil,

539
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:08,179
Well, not everybody understands the patterns,

540
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,865
And that gave me a little bit more of an uptake,

541
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,065
but it's just a parlor trick,

542
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,643
So then, I went on to door number three,

543
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:16,049
Are you really implying that you have some sort of ultimate formula?

544
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,383
Well, from 12,000 to 2,3 million in ten days,

545
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:22,910
I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce,        Delusions of grandeur,

546
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,575
I don't have delusions of grandeur,

547
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:27,219
I have an actual recipe for grandeur,

548
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:32,514
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what you game is,

549
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,569
but I'm sure of one thing,

550
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:34,756
You don't work in my world,

551
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,906
I'm up to my ass with investment guys

552
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:38,320
and you don't have their half-terrified,

553
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,385
half-cocky line of crap which is...

554
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,189
...not to say that I like yours any better,

555
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:44,760
But you obviously pick your stocks

556
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,230
in a way which I haven't seen before,

557
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:50,230
Take a look at these companies and tell me what you think,

558
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,662
Right now?        Yeah, Take your time,

559
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,532
Sure,

560
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:12,030
These companies aren't the question, are they?

561
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:14,768
Explain,

562
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,398
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence,

563
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,304
Control the whole power enchilada, but, no,

564
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,864
these companies wouldn't get you there in emerging markets,

565
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,000
You would have to... Oh, Whoa,

566
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:28,703
This must be some big-ass merger you're contemplating,

567
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,709
And there's really only one company with enough bling

568
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:34,768
to justify a merger with Van Loon and Associates,

569
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:37,774
Who have you been talking to?

570
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:38,781
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots,

571
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,509
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

572
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,256
Well, you're an amazing con artist,

573
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,108
or you're a very smart young man,

574
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,912
I mean, come on, The two of you together?

575
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,542
The whole world would have to come begging for energy

576
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,642
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel,

577
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,243
Now you're going backwards, What else you got?

578
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,583
A prediction, It won't come off,        Why's that?

579
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:02,020
You'd have to back off Libya,        Really?

580
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,516
Well, you don't want to hear this from some schmuck

581
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:05,689
who needs a ride home,

582
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,167
All right, you get your shot,

583
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:10,353
Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

584
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,688
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home

585
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,988
would re-structure these deals, And you'd better be prepared,

586
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,583
I'm at your disposal,

587
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,651
You don't really live here, do you?

588
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,958
Well... Spartans weren't big on amenities,

589
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,324
Yeah, and they eventually got their asses kicked,

590
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:37,960
I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest.

591
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,488
There are moments in life...

592
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:41,333
moments when you know you've crossed a bridge.

593
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:42,733
Your old life is over.

594
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,702
Van Loon was my bridge. I finally had my shot.

595
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,296
Wall Street would provide my nest egg, but then how far could I go?

596
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:53,066
CEO? A global force? Maybe President.

597
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,727
Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.

598
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:09,818
Suddenly...

599
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:16,456
It was another skip. How had I gone the last 20 blocks?

600
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,924
I got another ten blocks. And then...

601
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:27,388
...I was way uptown.

602
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:13,009
What bar was this?

603
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:29,139
...black canvas and then they would just drop all the paint...

604
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:33,683
Yeah, Did you ever meet...

605
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,412
...and then I actually went there and had lunch, I went back,

606
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:38,510
My friends are rolling...

607
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,687
I heard you like to party.

608
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:09,060
Hey, watch it,        Hey, hey! Take it easy!

609
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:12,155
A fight? Don't know how to fight.

610
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:13,722
Or do I?

611
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,201
You use the fishhook action to get inside the mouth.

612
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:29,504
Like this.

613
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:42,141
Attack the sensitive areas. The eyes, the throat, the groin.

614
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,835
If you are hit, do not stop.

615
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:52,505
Your persistence will discourage your attacker.

616
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,339
Off-balancing your opponent

617
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:58,279
and then using his momentum, take him down.

618
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:31,656
When it finally stopped,

619
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:35,251
I couldn't account for the last 18 hours of my life.

620
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,029
Hey, it's me. I thought you were coming over.

621
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:03,127
Is everything OK? Call me when you get this.

622
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:47,356
Even off NZT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.

623
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,759
They were hieroglyphs.

624
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,723
Hello?        Kevin, this is Eddie.

625
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,822
Eddie?        Listen,

626
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:06,832
I can't make the meeting today.        What are you talking about?

627
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,566
I can't come in today, I'm sick,

628
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:11,863
Yeah, well you can't have the flu right now,

629
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,231
He'll never give you this chance again,

630
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:18,896
I know, listen, I just... I have all this data to analyze...

631
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:21,733
What have you been doing for the last day?

632
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:26,072
Kev, I...        Don't you get it? This is your test,

633
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:29,740
Yeah, well, I can't pass the test right now,

634
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,968
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

635
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,736
I know, listen, I just...        Sh, Listen to me,

636
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,572
Pull yourself together, Get down to the meeting,

637
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,604
OK, OK, I'll be there, I'll be there,

638
00:49:09,088 --> 00:49:11,384
Hey, how are ya?        Eddie,

639
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:13,116
Good to see you again,

640
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,686
Sit down,

641
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:21,149
What do you know about Hank Atwood?

642
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,087
Atwood, um...

643
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,019
He's an iconoclast, um...

644
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:32,028
Owns about half of Colorado,

645
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:35,155
So this is prepared, Eddie?

646
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,220
Uh...

647
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:38,408
Is this Atwood 101?

648
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:40,494
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

649
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:42,192
Where was he two years ago?

650
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:47,532
Hm?        Nowhere,

651
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:52,292
Two years ago he wasn't even on Forbes' radar,

652
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,160
That was a great leap forward, right?

653
00:49:57,038 --> 00:50:00,802
I'm baffled by this guy, He comes out of nowhere so strong,

654
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,840
Has me on the run before I can even get to anybody in his camp,

655
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:05,567
Beats me out of two properties,

656
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:08,233
investing in countries with no oil, Places I'd never go near...

657
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:17,942
We're here in front of the hotel where a woman,

658
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,881
identified as Maria Winberg,

659
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:21,965
was found dead in her room last night,

660
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,152
a victim of foul play.

661
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:28,008
Ms. Winberg was a well-known socialite and model...

662
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:32,278
...but was also known for her dedicated charity work around the city.

663
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,545
Police spent hours questioning hotel staff and patrons

664
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:38,813
and an eyewitness reported seeing a man leaving the scene...

665
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,738
... help me convince him that I can raise his game,

666
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,615
Got any ideas?

667
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:44,449
What do you think?

668
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:50,187
Hotel has adequate security cameras...

669
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:57,357
You're not one of those kind of guys, are you Eddie?

670
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:59,483
We lose you if there's a screen in the room?

671
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,455
These are tectonic plates that are shifting right under us,

672
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,154
Pardon me, one second.

673
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:31,748
Was it possible? Could I have killed someone?

674
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:35,917
Was it even me?

675
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:43,219
Eddie? This is Melissa.

676
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,869
Listen, Vernon hasn't been giving you anything, has he?

677
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,188
Because that stuff is dangerous.

678
00:51:47,263 --> 00:51:48,728
Melissa?

679
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:51,458
Melissa, hey, do you think that we can meet somewhere?

680
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,924
I really need to talk to you,        We're talking now.

681
00:51:53,998 --> 00:51:55,509
No, no, let's meet at, uh... 

682
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,330
Billy's on Grant at noon?

683
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:59,729
You can't see me, Eddie.        No, no...

684
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,926
Eddie, please.        Please, please come, please come, I...

685
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:06,059
It's important, I really need to know what you're talking about,

686
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,899
I realized that there were other people who might know about NZT.

687
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:14,369
Vernon's other clients.

688
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,107
Hi.        Yeah, hi,

689
00:52:55,187 --> 00:52:56,652
may I please speak with Jerry Brady?

690
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,119
Jerry's in the hospital.        He's what?

691
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:01,051
Yeah, he's not doing well at all.

692
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:05,987
Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?        Uh, no. No, he's not.

693
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:09,319
Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.

694
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,220
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,

695
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,959
Yeah, he started getting headaches, then he collapsed at work.

696
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,391
Now he's in the ICU.

697
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,689
OK, please give him my best, Thank you,

698
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:24,128
Of all the people I called... three were dead and the rest were sick.

699
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:51,697
Hello? Hello?

700
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:10,869
Watch it, man!

701
00:54:28,152 --> 00:54:29,243
Did you see that?

702
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:31,809
Hey!

703
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:41,055
Go! Go!

704
00:55:07,866 --> 00:55:09,162
Eddie,

705
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:13,064
Melissa,

706
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:21,599
Hey,

707
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,802
Don't tell me I look good, 'cause I know,

708
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:32,863
I didn't want you to see me this way,

709
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,238
You look good,

710
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:38,036
Oh, I, uh...

711
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:40,505
Yeah, I sorta got myself together,

712
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,700
NZT will do that to you,

713
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,677
What do you mean?        I mean, I took it, too,

714
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:49,408
Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?

715
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,571
No,

716
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,706
Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug,

717
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:56,405
I was like, down the hatch, And it was, It was amazing,

718
00:55:57,003 --> 00:56:00,743
I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes

719
00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:02,081
and I understood it,

720
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:04,448
My work rate increased just insanely overnight

721
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:06,213
and my boss started to hate me,

722
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:13,020
They offered me his job and then... and then I got scared,

723
00:56:13,822 --> 00:56:16,563
Why?        Why? Because I'm not stupid,

724
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:19,871
Nobody can operate at that level of mental activity and not crash,

725
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:24,123
I stopped taking it,

726
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:28,558
And?        And I got sick, Headaches,

727
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:34,322
Throwing up, So I went back to Vernon,

728
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:36,251
He told me about all the people that were dying,

729
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:39,798
How much have you been taking, Eddie?

730
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,869
I've been taking a lot,

731
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:48,202
Well, maybe... maybe they've worked out the bugs, Maybe...

732
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,662
Maybe this is a different batch,

733
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:54,937
Yeah,        You're off it right now, aren't you?

734
00:56:55,006 --> 00:56:57,495
Just finish your story,

735
00:56:57,574 --> 00:57:00,439
...I didn't take any more and I didn't die,

736
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:04,867
But after a while, I realized I couldn't concentrate on anything

737
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,137
for longer than ten minutes,

738
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:11,304
I, uh... I missed deadlines, got lazy, slow, so slow,

739
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,478
That was two years ago,

740
00:57:16,414 --> 00:57:18,472
And I haven't been the same since,

741
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:27,082
Do you have some left? Good,

742
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,460
You go home and you take it, 

743
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,516
You take the dose down, but you don't just stop,

744
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:32,347
You'll die if you just stop,

745
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:37,784
Try to taper off, otherwise the headaches are just the beginning,

746
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:41,320
I have to go,

747
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:45,781
Do you know who makes it?        I don't know,

748
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:48,824
I have to go,

749
00:58:19,503 --> 00:58:24,300
Oh, shit, Listen, listen, listen, Listen, listen, listen... OK,

750
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,098
You forget about me, huh?        No, no, no, no,

751
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:28,138
12:00 and you're not here,

752
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,196
I'm here now, Oh!        Good,

753
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:34,500
Come on, get going,        I could write you a check,

754
00:58:34,574 --> 00:58:39,564
Check, Check, Are you out of your mind?

755
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:41,905
What do you think I am? Some financial institution?

756
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,069
All right, You're right, Look, we just need to go to a bank...

757
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:51,011
What do you got there?

758
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,713
What is it?        No, it's just aspirin,

759
00:58:57,782 --> 00:59:03,274
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see, It's something good, huh?

760
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:26,184
I feel good, man, What's in this stuff?

761
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:29,056
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin,

762
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:32,855
You full of shit, Eddie baby,

763
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,360
Lindy, I wouldn't have let him in, but...

764
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:04,166
I'm sorry...        Tyler, I gotta go,

765
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:07,033
I'm sick,

766
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:12,440
I shouldn't... I'm sorry, I couldn't make it home,

767
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,601
Let's get you to a hospital,        No, no, no, no, no, I don't need...

768
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:16,733
I need you to get...

769
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:20,800
It's really simple, babe, I need my pills,

770
01:00:20,877 --> 01:00:23,470
Eddie, what pills?        I don't... Babe, it's complicated,

771
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:26,308
What are you taking? Are you on drugs?

772
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,347
They're... it's...

773
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:32,711
I had no choice. I told Lindy everything.

774
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:38,816
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...

775
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:40,214
...has been a drug,

776
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:42,649
Well, it was supposed to be legal,

777
01:00:42,718 --> 01:00:46,311
I have a... a supply stashed,

778
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:49,848
You want me to go get it,

779
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:53,378
No, No, no, no, I'm gonna go get it,        Give me your keys,

780
01:00:53,456 --> 01:00:55,115
I'll go to your apartment,

781
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,090
It's not... in my apartment, I moved it,

782
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:02,956
OK, so where did you move it?

783
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:11,813
In my house,

784
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:15,173
Unbelievable,

785
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:30,253
Hey, have you got it?

786
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:31,883
Yeah,

787
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,483
There's someone following me,

788
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,289
Are you sure?

789
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,829
Yeah, He got into the cab behind me

790
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,920
and he's making every turn I'm making,

791
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:46,828
Baby, call the cops,        Can you go around him?

792
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:48,195
Babe, what's happening?

793
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:50,027
We're stopped dead,

794
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,732
He's getting out,

795
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:55,636
Eddie, he's walking over here,

796
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,396
Lindy?

797
01:01:57,966 --> 01:01:59,023
Oh, God!

798
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:17,129
Help! Help!

799
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:21,333
This man's... This man's chasing me!

800
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:24,933
He followed me from my building, I don't know him,

801
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,409
Please!        Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

802
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:33,071
Are you deaf? I said leave her alone,

803
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,272
Hey, buddy, are you trying to piss me off?

804
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:41,310
What are you doing, man?

805
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,868
Are you still there?        Yeah, I'm here, What happened?

806
01:03:15,936 --> 01:03:19,097
I'm stuck, He'll find me,

807
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,160
OK, stop talking. Don't move.

808
01:03:21,238 --> 01:03:23,898
He killed two guys.        What?

809
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:27,201
He's gonna kill me, too,        No, no, no...

810
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,399
Can he see you?

811
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,631
No,

812
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:36,206
Not yet,

813
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:40,134
I don't know what to do,

814
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,906
OK, I need you to go into the bag and take one of the pills,

815
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:46,042
Why?

816
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,545
Because you'll know what to do. You'll take it and then you'll know.

817
01:03:48,614 --> 01:03:52,513
He's got a knife, Eddie, I can't think my way out of a knife,

818
01:03:53,716 --> 01:03:55,807
Just listen to me, It'll come on in 30 seconds,

819
01:03:55,883 --> 01:03:57,782
And you'll think your way out, That's what it does,

820
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:24,852
He's getting closer,

821
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:28,960
Lindy, I love you,

822
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,572
Hey!

823
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:41,844
Now turn to me...

824
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:45,382
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

825
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,747
Ah!        Daddy!

826
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,683
Eddie, Here,

827
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:04,885
It's gonna be OK,

828
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,652
We've got to get out of here, Eddie?

829
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:46,420
You OK?

830
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,686
Yeah,

831
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:54,890
I'm so sorry about what happened,

832
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,086
I want you to know that you never, ever have to go through that again,

833
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:00,923
'cause I can take care of us now,

834
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:03,019
I'm sure you can,

835
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:05,619
I can make us safe, I'm back, OK?

836
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:12,194
Who's back, Eddie?        Me,

837
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:14,698
No, It's not you,

838
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:18,359
You were different before,        I'm still the same person, Lin,

839
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,061
I wasn't, when I was on it,

840
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:23,428
I did things I would never do,

841
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:26,096
Those things saved your life,        But they weren't me,

842
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,000
Yes, they were, No, the way it works...

843
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,271
I know how it works, I get it,

844
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:33,101
I totally get it, You feel invincible,

845
01:07:34,374 --> 01:07:37,033
Where it will take us, Lin, you can't even imagine,

846
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:41,565
The things we'll be able to do, Where we'll be a year from now,

847
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:45,303
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live,

848
01:07:45,377 --> 01:07:48,572
Well, you might have to live it without me,

849
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:55,274
Look, I am gonna stop taking it, There's just some things I have to do

850
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,872
to keep us safe and that... To set us up and then I'm gonna get off it,

851
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,576
I mean, that's the plan,        Eddie...

852
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,946
Look, I have a plan, I swear,

853
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:04,812
I'm gonna get off it,

854
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:07,582
OK,

855
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,109
I hope you do,

856
01:08:43,297 --> 01:08:45,196
Looking for me?

857
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,220
You think you can run out on me, huh? 

858
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,228
You think I don't know where you are?

859
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,096
I was under the impression our business was settled,

860
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:54,964
I want some more of that stuff,

861
01:08:55,035 --> 01:08:58,002
Or I shoot you right here, Take your pick,

862
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,866
This guy was not going away.

863
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,698
A few pills would buy me some time.

864
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:05,169
There it is, We're done,        Oh, yeah, We'll see,

865
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,831
Until I found a more... permanent solution.

866
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:09,912
Unless you see a real threat, 

867
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,374
I never want it known that I have any security,

868
01:09:12,442 --> 01:09:14,270
You'll never precede me, you'll always follow me,

869
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:18,197
Never more than 15 steps behind, And never stand too close together,

870
01:09:18,276 --> 01:09:20,971
I want to able to look behind me if the opportunity presents itself,

871
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:24,673
And don't wear the same color suit, This isn't The Matrix.

872
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:32,574
You have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off,

873
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:34,308
I was sick,        You don't get sick,

874
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:37,110
You're playing at this level, you get hit by a car, you don't even die,

875
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:39,843
You're absolutely right,        I know I'm right,

876
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:41,817
I mean, I didn't know who or what I was talking to,

877
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,114
A hundred and five, That's who you were talking to, Carl, Delirium,

878
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:46,000
Mm-hm,

879
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,560
I sent over my revised projections,

880
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,833
I didn't ask for your projections,

881
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,588
I know, but I think if you take a look at them...

882
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:55,617
I already have, As a matter of fact...

883
01:09:57,188 --> 01:10:00,383
...I fired a few people over your projections,

884
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:02,082
I'm sorry,        No, you're not,

885
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:04,988
You're relieved that you know things my team missed,

886
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:09,582
The minute, the instant that's no longer true...

887
01:10:12,494 --> 01:10:14,284
Two months after I'd started NZT,

888
01:10:14,285 --> 01:10:17,287
I was brokering the biggest merger in corporate history.

889
01:10:17,362 --> 01:10:19,654
Ironically, it's gonna be crude, 

890
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,798
Crude is gonna be where we're gonna hit them,

891
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:24,489
Which yields a prospective profit of 200 percent,

892
01:10:24,564 --> 01:10:26,428
That makes both of us very happy campers,

893
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:28,897
I found that if I maintained an even dose,

894
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:31,330
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,

895
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,798
the blackouts didn't recur.        How you doing, Eddie?

896
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:37,735
Tom, is it possible to construct an imperceptible compartment?

897
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:39,269
In this jacket?

898
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:42,769
In all of them,        Certainly, sir,

899
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:44,946
Safer though my stash now was, 

900
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,966
I was not sitting around until it ran out.

901
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,600
Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantity, 

902
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,371
yes, but,

903
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:55,237
the exact method of delivery to the brain... Darts at a dartboard,

904
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:57,935
Meaning?        Clinical trials, guinea pig people,

905
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,533
That's gonna take too long,        It's what it is,

906
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:04,100
Or you'll kill people, You need 12, to 18 months...

907
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:06,405
I'll give you two million dollars if you can do it in six,

908
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:18,783
I found that we can cut costs 30 percent and, um...

909
01:11:22,185 --> 01:11:23,515
Excuse me one second,

910
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:29,246
I thought we straightened this out, Detective,

911
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,254
This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra,

912
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:35,720
What is this about?

913
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:41,122
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect as this person,

914
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:48,692
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?

915
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:52,855
I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.

916
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:58,554
Enter Morris Brandt... the most lethal lawyer in New York.

917
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:03,766
You're lucky somebody wiped the room, 

918
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,228
It's weak, Circumstantial at best,

919
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:09,325
Just between us, were you there?

920
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:10,628
I don't remember,

921
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:13,759
I don't want to make concessions to you...

922
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:15,894
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

923
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:19,960
had no idea I might soon be charged with murder.

924
01:12:20,038 --> 01:12:22,733
But SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying

925
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,829
for the same industrial concessions in Libya

926
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,168
that both our companies are pretending we're not sniffing out,

927
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,605
How do you know this?

928
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:32,268
The governmental bribe system is itself corrupt, so, of course,

929
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:35,468
information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought,

930
01:12:38,045 --> 01:12:39,443
Go on,

931
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:42,910
If you take a look at the lower left-hand column, in 2008,

932
01:12:42,979 --> 01:12:45,012
five companies were jockeying for a position 

933
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:46,414
before we even took notice,

934
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,476
Jesus, he looks frail,

935
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:54,881
Could be an act,        He's not even 60,

936
01:12:57,218 --> 01:13:00,276
So, have you decided, Eddie? What are you gonna do?

937
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:03,444
When this is over? I don't know,

938
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,918
You haven't given me the answer,

939
01:13:04,987 --> 01:13:06,851
You haven't asked the question,

940
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:08,682
Well, given the scale of my contribution,

941
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:11,085
let's say 45,

942
01:13:11,156 --> 01:13:14,146
Done, Forty-five thousand dollars,

943
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,807
Forty million is plenty, Eddie, 

944
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:17,659
There's a lot more where that came from,

945
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:20,055
You know, Eddie...

946
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,182
...it may be on your mind

947
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:23,658
that you're not gonna continue to work for me anymore,

948
01:13:23,727 --> 01:13:25,455
This has been the learning experience of my life,

949
01:13:25,528 --> 01:13:28,017
I hope it has, I hope you don't think you've gotten enough from me,

950
01:13:28,094 --> 01:13:29,618
On to the next,

951
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,508
Well, in order for a career to evolve, I'm gonna have to move on,

952
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,097
That you would even think that would only show me

953
01:13:35,098 --> 01:13:37,529
how unprepared you are to be on your own,

954
01:13:37,598 --> 01:13:39,963
I mean, you do know you're a freak,

955
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:42,617
Your deductive powers are a gift from God, or chance,

956
01:13:42,633 --> 01:13:44,964
or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote

957
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,331
your life script, a gift not earned,

958
01:13:47,402 --> 01:13:51,301
You do not know what I know because you have not earned those powers,

959
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,257
You're careless with those powers,

960
01:13:53,257 --> 01:13:54,940
You flaunt them and you throw them around 

961
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:57,000
like a brat with his trust fund,

962
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,505
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs,

963
01:13:59,572 --> 01:14:01,669
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers, 

964
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:02,563
You haven't done the time

965
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,670
in that first marriage to the girl with the right father,

966
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,270
You think you can leap over all in a single bound,

967
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,866
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten your way

968
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:11,037
to a seat at that table, 

969
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,139
You don't know how to assess your competition

970
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:16,440
because you haven't competed, Don't make me your competition,

971
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,304
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you,

972
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,438
You'll be wanting a few toys,

973
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:43,780
Hotel rooms were no longer an option.

974
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,878
What I needed was a bunker.

975
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:48,522
There's a built-in safe, central surveillance,

976
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:51,015
vault grade pneumatic doors.

977
01:14:51,091 --> 01:14:54,422
It's an unparalleled three-tier security system,

978
01:14:54,492 --> 01:14:57,857
A fortress with a hell of a view,

979
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:04,857
What's the asking price?        Eight-point-five,

980
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:11,228
I'll take it,

981
01:15:16,866 --> 01:15:19,731
Right away, it was obvious he was on NZT.

982
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,500
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills,

983
01:15:22,535 --> 01:15:24,501
Next week, you can go fuck yourself!

984
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:26,160
Not that you'd feel anything,

985
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:30,797
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial friends would appreciate

986
01:15:30,871 --> 01:15:33,997
the details of your little dilemma with the police,

987
01:15:34,973 --> 01:15:37,700
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here,

988
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,174
Getting smarter!

989
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,066
Obviously, this could not go on,

990
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:47,730
but there is very little on this earth 

991
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:49,305
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

992
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:53,004
And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.

993
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:03,338
Do you want to call it?        Cold feet?

994
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,974
There was all last night to tell us that,

995
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:10,177
Anything?        I'll call him again, sir.

996
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:13,327
OK, the decision could have changed, That makes sense,

997
01:16:13,328 --> 01:16:16,465
The discourtesy doesn't, It's still on,

998
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:19,814
Oh, based on your charts and projections,

999
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:22,982
You know, remind me, who the fuck are you, anyway?

1000
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:23,851
I'm sorry, Carl,

1001
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:25,786
I've had it with this unqualified, posturing little prick,

1002
01:16:25,858 --> 01:16:27,982
Pull it back,        Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

1003
01:16:28,057 --> 01:16:31,924
Pull it back,        Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

1004
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:33,608
Mrs. Atwood is in your office,

1005
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,793
Ah, Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon,

1006
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:41,295
My associate, Edward Morra,        Pleasure,

1007
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:46,356
I wanted to make this as confidential as possible,

1008
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:48,022
Of course,

1009
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:51,998
My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning,

1010
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,692
He's currently at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests,

1011
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:57,699
I just want you to know we have every intention

1012
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,164
of signing the contract,

1013
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:03,786
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed,

1014
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,388
I realize this is a useless platitude, 

1015
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,893
but if there's anything that we can do,

1016
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,290
please don't hesitate to tell us,

1017
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,224
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and respectful

1018
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,817
as possible, Mrs. Atwood,

1019
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,690
Thank you, gentlemen, I rely on your discretion,

1020
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:18,786
There won't be a proxy,

1021
01:17:18,863 --> 01:17:21,921
No, a cagey prick like him giving away power of attorney?

1022
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:28,355
Well, he'd better get better,

1023
01:17:31,501 --> 01:17:35,902
But Atwood wouldn't get better. Because Atwood was out of NZT.

1024
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:42,962
Well, why be surprised?

1025
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,473
How many other meteoric rises might be explained by NZT?

1026
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,972
At least I had some.

1027
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,166
My life wasn't in jeopardy.        You can wait here,

1028
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:53,231
Only my money. And my liberty.

1029
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:56,073
I've been all over with them,

1030
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:58,508
We can't allow any disparity in race

1031
01:17:58,577 --> 01:18:01,192
or physical type between you and the rest of the line up,

1032
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:01,800
OK,

1033
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:04,843
They're as close to your clones as I could possibly get,

1034
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,676
It's gotta be just one big handsome blur to this guy.

1035
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,352
Who was out there?

1036
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:27,985
The woman's husband?

1037
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:30,687
A hotel maid?

1038
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:35,146
Was this how it was all going to end?

1039
01:18:39,491 --> 01:18:42,015
Not the dimmest clue, He was dithering,

1040
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:45,060
"He was the third one from the right, No, Not him,"

1041
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:50,561
There you go, It's a thing of beauty, You have that made?

1042
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,220
I did,

1043
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:10,899
...market's been mixed today.

1044
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:13,663
The Dow has been yo-yoing amidst speculation that

1045
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:18,467
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...

1046
01:19:19,573 --> 01:19:21,334
Have you been talking to anyone?

1047
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,572
No, I haven't been talking to anybody, Carl, I'm not stupid,

1048
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:26,868
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

1049
01:19:26,941 --> 01:19:28,909
but don't make the classic smart person's mistake,

1050
01:19:28,975 --> 01:19:30,839
Thinking no one's smarter than you,

1051
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,022
Where the hell have you been? 

1052
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,072
This is the second time you've turned to vapor,

1053
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,782
I was in the building, I was getting coffee, 

1054
01:19:35,782 --> 01:19:37,010
Why, has there been movement?

1055
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:39,409
Yeah, there's been movement alright, Atwood's in a coma,

1056
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,003
He wasn't playing us, He's dying,

1057
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:43,671
What do you know about this?

1058
01:19:43,747 --> 01:19:47,340
I was less than usually equipped to answer.

1059
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:51,781
The dullness was coming on. I was overdue to take my NZT.

1060
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:55,045
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.

1061
01:19:55,118 --> 01:19:56,379
Excuse me,

1062
01:19:56,452 --> 01:19:57,975
You're not excused,

1063
01:19:58,052 --> 01:20:00,576
What? A man in your employ can't take a piss, Carl?

1064
01:20:23,261 --> 01:20:25,159
Was it Brandt or someone else?

1065
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:27,787
The police station? A coatroom?

1066
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:43,097
Mr. Morra,

1067
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:45,657
Carl, I'm sorry...        Mr. Morra, Mr. Morra!

1068
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:47,496
This just came for you,        Yeah, what?

1069
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:56,004
Hope not, so let me know when you know,

1070
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:57,242
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie, 

1071
01:20:57,242 --> 01:20:58,552
What do you know about this?

1072
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,678
What? About the leak?        No, About Atwood,

1073
01:21:01,905 --> 01:21:03,267
What? What about Atwood?

1074
01:21:03,267 --> 01:21:05,764
Look, you got a long way to go as a liar, kiddo,

1075
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:07,487
Carl, I don't know what you're...        Listen!

1076
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,959
What you're about to say is bullshit,

1077
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:10,317
I know there's something you're hiding from me,

1078
01:21:10,318 --> 01:21:12,113
I smell it on you, Right now,

1079
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:15,479
I wanna know why this clusterfuck of a deal is dead in the water!

1080
01:21:17,182 --> 01:21:19,206
Carl,

1081
01:21:19,283 --> 01:21:21,272
Eddie! Eddie!

1082
01:21:37,857 --> 01:21:39,789
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,

1083
01:21:39,857 --> 01:21:42,620
more twists and turns in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.

1084
01:21:42,692 --> 01:21:46,523
There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger.

1085
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:50,381
None whatsoever. My husband is having tests.

1086
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:52,486
This is a difficult time.

1087
01:21:52,561 --> 01:21:56,460
We would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney.

1088
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:58,996
Yes, we have no further comments at this time.

1089
01:21:59,064 --> 01:22:01,692
We're just awaiting the results of the latest round of tests

1090
01:22:01,692 --> 01:22:03,266
and hoping for the best.

1091
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,519
Thank you.

1092
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:47,658
Eddie, I know you're in there, Eddie,

1093
01:22:48,935 --> 01:22:51,834
Open up,

1094
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:56,128
Come on,

1095
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:00,270
Open the door,

1096
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:19,707
And so, here I am.

1097
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:25,174
I knew they would kill me slowly and horribly.

1098
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:28,374
But this choice would at least be mine.

1099
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:42,152
But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live.

1100
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,649
So my foggy brain tried to remember 

1101
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,712
where one tablet of NZT might be.

1102
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:58,755
It was possible. And possible was enough.

1103
01:24:22,101 --> 01:24:23,692
Hey, Eddie,

1104
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:49,443
Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?

1105
01:24:50,778 --> 01:24:53,369
I don't like being down to this last one,

1106
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:55,378
You don't even know how to use it,

1107
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:57,811
You don't appreciate it,

1108
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,972
You see, I dissolve in a solution,

1109
01:25:01,048 --> 01:25:05,708
You shoot it, It goes straight into the blood and brain,

1110
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:09,476
Lasts much longer,

1111
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:25,914
So...

1112
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,616
You gonna tell me where the rest is?

1113
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,351
I'm plumb out,

1114
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,864
Go look.

1115
01:25:34,993 --> 01:25:37,720
You know, these guys are gonna find it,

1116
01:25:38,894 --> 01:25:41,418
Or I'm gonna make you tell me,

1117
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:44,463
Question is, which is gonna come first?

1118
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,522
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?

1119
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:54,529
This is a waste of my time, you know?

1120
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,533
I'm getting out of this side of the business,

1121
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:02,297
I'm branching out, I'm starting import-export company,

1122
01:26:03,169 --> 01:26:04,429
Very exciting stuff,

1123
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,996
I got a lot on my plate, You're lucky I'm here,

1124
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,940
There's a safe.

1125
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:21,534
Back in the old times, I might peel your skin back, Fillet you,

1126
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,371
"Fillet," It's a nice word,

1127
01:26:24,443 --> 01:26:29,140
I didn't know this before, Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary,

1128
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:36,249
But then I discovered this thing, Google,

1129
01:26:37,186 --> 01:26:40,744
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?

1130
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,651
I had no idea, I don't believe it,

1131
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:46,553
I gotta see this for myself, I'm dubious, It's another nice word,

1132
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:50,954
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too,

1133
01:26:51,024 --> 01:26:53,547
Don't worry, everything's sterilized,

1134
01:26:53,624 --> 01:26:56,682
We're gonna keep you alive for the whole shebang,

1135
01:26:56,759 --> 01:26:58,885
You're gonna get a front row seat, Eddie,

1136
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,260
What?

1137
01:27:36,307 --> 01:27:38,467
Not much of a triumph, was it?

1138
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,733
Because I would die here, too.

1139
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,150
Only NZT could help me 

1140
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:47,173
and the last of it was in this fuck's blood stream.

1141
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:04,064
Victor!

1142
01:29:11,839 --> 01:29:13,466
What?

1143
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:28,906
Hey!

1144
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:29,786
I can't see.

1145
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:15,399
On your right, shoot him.

1146
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:24,042
Victor?

1147
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:28,548
Victor?

1148
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:31,053
Victor?

1149
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,767
The police would later note

1150
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:24,867
that my apartment's previous owner was an arms dealer.

1151
01:31:24,942 --> 01:31:28,263
Of course, these intruders had been his dissatisfied clients.

1152
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:32,069
And the night was still young.

1153
01:31:45,283 --> 01:31:47,408
I'm sure you're curious about what happened to your boss,

1154
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:48,754
I know I certainly am,

1155
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:52,349
I mean, if my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood,

1156
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,605
trying to save his life, why is he dead?

1157
01:31:56,953 --> 01:31:59,545
I mean, at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in

1158
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,712
with his life-saving medication?

1159
01:32:02,755 --> 01:32:04,779
His boss was dead.

1160
01:32:04,856 --> 01:32:07,074
So, I didn't matter now.

1161
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:11,213
But he did not appreciate that Morris Brandt 

1162
01:32:11,213 --> 01:32:13,754
had kept the pills for himself.

1163
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:28,061
And it was all still possible.

1164
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,900
TWELVE MONTHS LATER

1165
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:48,138
Actually, no, there's no more tickets,

1166
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:53,562
Yeah, I know, An overbooked fundraiser, That's a first,

1167
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,299
Well, here he comes, I'll ask him,

1168
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,507
Oh, that's much better,

1169
01:32:57,575 --> 01:32:59,371
Great job,        Thank you, sir,

1170
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,334
Hi, Mr. Morra,

1171
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,238
Edward!

1172
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:06,872
I think we're looking at a second overflow event,

1173
01:33:06,945 --> 01:33:08,934
There's a wave of donations coming in and I don't think

1174
01:33:09,012 --> 01:33:11,343
they're even gonna try a second debate,

1175
01:33:11,413 --> 01:33:12,673
Great.        Hold on,

1176
01:33:12,746 --> 01:33:14,373
A guy from Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office,

1177
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:16,090
I have a lunch,        They're your biggest contributor,

1178
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,474
Give him his two crappy little minutes,

1179
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:19,946
Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?        Yeah,

1180
01:33:21,816 --> 01:33:24,510
Finally get to meet the guys that keep the lights on,

1181
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,814
Carl!        Mr. Morra,

1182
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:32,775
What a surprise, They told me somebody from Eiben was coming,

1183
01:33:32,854 --> 01:33:34,090
Chemcorp, Yeah, that's me now, 

1184
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,220
I'm moving out of the energy business,

1185
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:40,016
Come on, That's like Hef moving out of the mansion,

1186
01:33:40,089 --> 01:33:41,615
Yeah, I bought Eiben a couple of months ago, 

1187
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:43,319
I'm surprised you didn't hear,

1188
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:47,449
No, No, Well, they really keep me hopping here,

1189
01:33:47,525 --> 01:33:50,321
Well, it's gonna pay off, Senator Morra,

1190
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:54,057
The Senate, Who knows...

1191
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:57,458
Everything's a technicality from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

1192
01:33:58,129 --> 01:34:02,688
I think we both know where it's headed, if you can maintain,

1193
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,726
Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do when you run out?

1194
01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:26,883
When did you know?        Does it matter? I know now,

1195
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:29,903
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie, 

1196
01:34:29,903 --> 01:34:31,941
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share,

1197
01:34:31,941 --> 01:34:33,439
We could have been partners,

1198
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:39,040
So, Eiben makes NZT,

1199
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:41,977
Well, it'll never officially exist,

1200
01:34:41,978 --> 01:34:44,501
Obviously, I don't need to point out the advantages for you,

1201
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:46,934
Oh, I think maybe you do,

1202
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:50,945
Limitless supply, We know you can't get any more,

1203
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:52,537
You sure about that?

1204
01:34:52,615 --> 01:34:54,410
They shut down your lab this morning,

1205
01:34:56,949 --> 01:35:00,473
Eddie, I just want to help you, that's all,

1206
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:03,540
Keep you supplied, No disruption in service,

1207
01:35:03,618 --> 01:35:05,676
Give you peace of mind, That's all,

1208
01:35:07,353 --> 01:35:10,344
And in return, I do what?

1209
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:14,253
Get a little advice, maybe, I won't be bothering you much at first,

1210
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:16,788
And later, What are you gonna be bothering me with?

1211
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:18,423
Well, given where you're heading, 

1212
01:35:18,423 --> 01:35:20,552
some of our ideas are a bit ambitious,

1213
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,488
But hey, I think they're achievable,

1214
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:24,320
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1215
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:26,791
Then we'll say, "Godspeed,"

1216
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:30,349
And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light,

1217
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,717
But you know what, Eddie, let's not even

1218
01:35:33,796 --> 01:35:34,784
go there right now,

1219
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:38,159
Right now, I just want to keep you brilliant...

1220
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:41,959
...and healthy, Come on, Let's go get some lunch,

1221
01:36:00,204 --> 01:36:02,171
After you, Senator,

1222
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:05,604
Thanks for stopping by, Carl,

1223
01:36:06,506 --> 01:36:08,269
Give us a second,

1224
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,035
What are you doing? Do you want to be President of the United States

1225
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:13,803
or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?        I'll take my chances,

1226
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,890
I told you your chances don't exist, We shut down your lab,

1227
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:18,371
You don't think some smartass on NZT

1228
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,071
might have two or three or even four labs?

1229
01:36:20,145 --> 01:36:21,605
So what? You're not making any more,

1230
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:22,305
That's right, I'm not,

1231
01:36:22,305 --> 01:36:24,437
I thought better of it, See, once you know what's in it,

1232
01:36:24,513 --> 01:36:28,139
you can tweak it, re-engineer it, Get the bugs out, Taper off,

1233
01:36:28,848 --> 01:36:30,178
I'm off it, Carl,

1234
01:36:30,248 --> 01:36:31,509
Well, on it or off it,

1235
01:36:31,582 --> 01:36:33,879
there's no scenario where you're not working for me,

1236
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,472
How you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?

1237
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,710
Last year you traded

1238
01:36:36,784 --> 01:36:38,751
inside information 17 times,        You threatening me?

1239
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:40,941
Blank checks from Dubai, Dumping in Chile, 

1240
01:36:40,942 --> 01:36:41,945
Disappeared officials,

1241
01:36:41,946 --> 01:36:42,900
I mean, you shed a spot light...

1242
01:36:42,901 --> 01:36:44,095
Do you want to go to war with me?

1243
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,320
And trust me when I say this, I'm not even being creative,

1244
01:36:46,321 --> 01:36:48,288
There's no way you can be making accusations like that

1245
01:36:48,355 --> 01:36:50,491
and be walking around alive,

1246
01:36:50,755 --> 01:36:52,127
That you would even think that shows me 

1247
01:36:52,127 --> 01:36:53,409
how unprepared you are to fight me,

1248
01:36:53,423 --> 01:36:54,603
You're no longer equipped to fight me,

1249
01:36:54,604 --> 01:36:56,347
I may be off it, but you think I didn't learn anything? 

1250
01:36:56,348 --> 01:36:57,523
That my synapses didn't change?

1251
01:36:57,524 --> 01:36:58,822
That I kept absolutely nothing?

1252
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:00,600
You have no idea what kind of enemy I can be,

1253
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:03,752
That van's gonna rear-end that taxi,        What?

1254
01:37:03,752 --> 01:37:06,187
The driver's distracted, He's texting, He's going 30 miles an hour,

1255
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,128
He has 60 feet to stop, He doesn't have room,

1256
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:09,924
What van?

1257
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:14,628
I see everything, Carl,

1258
01:37:14,697 --> 01:37:16,888
I'm 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else,

1259
01:37:16,889 --> 01:37:19,395
What makes you think I don't have a guy with a bead on you right now?

1260
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,194
How do you know you're gonna be alive this time next year?

1261
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:24,427
What are you doing? You get your hands off me, What are you doing?

1262
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,421
Something's pumping half-mass in there, 

1263
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:27,696
The walls of your heart are dilated,

1264
01:37:27,696 --> 01:37:30,530
Your aortic valve's steno, So you're gonna need to get that replaced,

1265
01:37:32,303 --> 01:37:33,930
But you already knew that,

1266
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:41,602
You know, you should really be glad about this,

1267
01:37:41,673 --> 01:37:44,697
'Cause me working for you? You'd end up as my bitch,

1268
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:59,407
Maybe we should cool off, Talk again,

1269
01:38:01,247 --> 01:38:03,110
I don't think so,

1270
01:38:04,715 --> 01:38:05,942
Don't forget to vote,

1271
01:38:14,252 --> 01:38:15,683
Edward,

1272
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:17,378
You good?

1273
01:38:17,453 --> 01:38:20,420
Yeah, Told you I have a lunch,

1274
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:28,720
Sorry I'm late,        Hey, Don't worry,

1275
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:33,314
How's your day going?        Ah, I've had better,

1276
01:38:35,191 --> 01:38:37,182
I still can't deal with that haircut,

1277
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,351
I wouldn't even recognize you on the street,

1278
01:38:39,427 --> 01:38:41,189
Well, I'm a new man,

1279
01:38:42,495 --> 01:38:43,518
I've already ordered,

1280
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,200

1281
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,094
What?

1282
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:21,800
