1
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,691
I never thought
That I could be so satisfied

2
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,386
Every time that I look in your angel eyes

3
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,262
A shock inside me
That words just can't describe

4
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,833
And there's no explaining

5
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,740
Something in the way you move
I can't deny

6
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:17,405
Every word from your lips is a lullaby

7
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,177
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

8
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,946
y ou are gold and silver

9
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,850
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

10
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:32,430
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

11
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:35,431
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

12
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:39,731
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

13
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:44,865
And I just can't let you go

14
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:47,877
I can't lose this feeling

15
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,709
These precious moments
We have so few

16
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:55,479
Let's go far away
Where there's nothing to do but play

17
00:01:55,654 --> 00:02:00,216
y ou've shown to me
That my destiny's with you

18
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:02,656
And there's no explaining

19
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,989
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

20
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:10,829
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

21
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,631
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

22
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:17,469
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

23
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:22,842
And I just can't let you go

24
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,143
I can't lose this feeling

25
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:40,427
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

26
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,036
y ou are gold and silver

27
00:02:45,204 --> 00:02:48,037
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

28
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:52,541
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

29
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,169
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

30
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,545
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

31
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:00,946
And I just

32
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,055
Can't let you go

33
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,693
PoP was one of the biggest bands
of the '80s...

34
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:13,457
...but today they're known
as Colin Thompson's old group.

35
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,624
Colin, or as he's been dubbed
by the queen, "Sir Colin"...

36
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:20,135
...has gone on to sell millions of records,
star in blockbuster films...

37
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:23,002
...and create his own cologne,
"A Whiff of Colin."

38
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:24,437
But here's a question:

39
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,977
Can you remember the name
of the other guy in PoP?

40
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,139
Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,743
Tonight we find out
on Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

42
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:40,458
We think it's gonna be bigger
than American Idol.

43
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,093
So, what do you think, Alex?

44
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:43,387
Well, I love it.

45
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:47,498
It's brilliant on so many levels,
I don't even know where to start.

46
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,655
Good for you.

47
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,961
Because some of the people
we've approached...

48
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:55,004
...have had a little problem
with the term "has-been."

49
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:56,163
Have they? Have they?

50
00:03:56,342 --> 00:04:00,711
You see, I don't share that.
I am a happy has-been. Really.

51
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,109
It's a very clear statement:
"I live in the past.

52
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:05,182
Everything good I ever did
was long ago.

53
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,683
Don't expect anything
new or exciting from me now."

54
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,720
Really takes the pressure off.
Especially on a first date.

55
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,254
Good for you.

56
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:15,458
So we've already taped several shows...

57
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:17,891
...and we're going to start
airing them this week.

58
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:20,725
And some of the performers
include REO Speedwagon...

59
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,730
- Speedwagon.
...Flock of Seagulls...

60
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,061
The Flock? Okay.

61
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,965
...Debbie Gibson, Tiffany...
- Debbie.

62
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:30,203
- History there.
...and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

63
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,311
So "Relax."

64
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,746
Nice one.

65
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:38,474
Good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all.

66
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,346
And how many songs
would I actually get to perform?

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,147
I'd like to do two, you know?

68
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,552
A ballad and then maybe
a more up-tempo number...

69
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,215
...where I get to shake it a bit.

70
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:52,956
I can't promise any of the acts
that they'll be singing.

71
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:57,601
Sorry? Confused.
What would we be doing, then?

72
00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,764
Boxing.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,472
That's why the show is called
Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

74
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:09,671
Only the winner gets to sing.

75
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:19,184
Right, right, right. Got you.

76
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,027
- Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hello, Willy.

77
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,188
Have a good day.

78
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,301
Yes, well, enjoyed it so far.

79
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:34,094
- All right. There he is.
- Oh, my manager.

80
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,969
All right, listen,
I had no idea they meant boxing.

81
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,939
Nobody said a word to me, I swear.

82
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,046
No, it's not a problem.
I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls.

83
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:46,207
We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat
them severely. They cried like little girls.

84
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:49,980
All right, listen. It's my fault
and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset.

85
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,816
And do you know why?

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,514
You've been at my liquor.

87
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:54,989
Because of her.

88
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,993
Cora Corman.
Biggest star in the world.

89
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,530
Bigger than Britney and Christina
put together.

90
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,965
And guess who she loves.

91
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,229
Her country?

92
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:12,408
You. She's a huge PoP fan
and she wants to meet you, Alex.

93
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,512
Hang on, hang on.

94
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:17,504
Khan, I've missed you.

95
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,708
Alex, I have Sophie here for you.

96
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,477
That sounds like fun. Who is she?

97
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,951
She's here to do your plants.

98
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,283
But Jane does my plants.

99
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:29,325
She can be in and out in five minutes,
and this is really the best time for her.

100
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,690
It seems she cannot be stopped.
Send her up.

101
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,491
So start again. Cora Corman...

102
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,692
Why do you have a plant lady?
Why do you even have plants?

103
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,170
Because from time to time...

104
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,466
...ladies accompany me
back to the apartment...

105
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,439
...and one once mentioned
that plants make women comfortable.

106
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:48,444
Is that true?
Plants make women comfortable?

107
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:51,447
Well, maybe if I had plants
I'd still be married.

108
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,278
Yes, I think that was the problem.

109
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:55,443
Not Susan's affair
and raging nymphomania...

110
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,555
...but your lack of vegetation.

111
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:00,557
Hang on.

112
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:08,528
- Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher.
- I'm Alex Fletcher.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,897
- You didn't get the message from Jane?
- No. I haven't listened to my...

114
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,630
She was supposed to let you know
I'd be doing plants.

115
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,335
Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in.

116
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,567
Thank you.

117
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:22,680
I hope you have your own watering can.
Jane told me that everyone had their own.

118
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:26,978
But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80,
he didn't have his own watering can...

119
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:30,121
...so he starts yelling at me
and screaming at me in German:

120
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,725
I'm fluent enough
to know what he's saying.

121
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,827
You haven't been cursed at
till you've been cursed at in German.

122
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,156
I know what you mean.
I dated a fraulein once.

123
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:44,057
Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink.
And I have my own can.

124
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh, well, vielen Dank.

125
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,634
Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager.

126
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:52,777
Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you.

127
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:56,444
So kitchen?

128
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,810
- Yeah.
- Great.

129
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,748
So Cora Corman, huh?
How great is that? Do you believe it?

130
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:06,448
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons.

131
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:11,324
Pros: She's a huge star,
great publicity, terrific money.

132
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,491
Cons?

133
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,293
No matter what you do,
in 40 years we'll both be dead.

134
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:20,131
Okay. Huge star, great publicity,
terrific money versus eventual death.

135
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,932
I think we have to think about it.

136
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,507
Okay, good, because Cora
is shooting a video tonight.

137
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,144
- She wants to meet both of us right after.
- Tonight?

138
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,506
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

139
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,240
You all right?

140
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,883
Do you have a Band-Aid
and antibiotic cream?

141
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:39,888
No, no. And sadly,
I think I've lent out my iron lung.

142
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,150
Okay.

143
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:44,693
Well, then I'm gonna go because,
you know, this could get infected.

144
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:48,663
And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean,
I'm a little hypochondriacal.

145
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,462
You just... You can never be too careful.

146
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,832
Anyway, I'll come back and finish.

147
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:56,839
So come again. I mean, you live here.
I'll come again.

148
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,499
I'm gonna go get this looked at.

149
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:02,545
You should really have a first-aid kit.
Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.

150
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,610
Weird.

151
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:09,413
- Don't give her a key.
- No.

152
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,317
So you said something about tonight.

153
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,481
Tonight we meet Cora.

154
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:21,294
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

155
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:24,060
Om shanti, shanti

156
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,261
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

157
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:29,236
Om shanti, shanti

158
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:31,938
I want a revelation

159
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,740
And sweet salvation

160
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,904
And the eternal fire

161
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,380
Show me the eternal fire

162
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,213
Like sitting meditation

163
00:09:43,755 --> 00:09:45,985
y ou give me elevation
Can you take me higher?

164
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,592
She seems like a very spiritual kid.

165
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,957
Yeah. It's nice to see
a young woman exploring religion.

166
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:02,906
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

167
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,873
My Buddha's delight

168
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,242
And cut.

169
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,343
Terrific.

170
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:17,979
- Hey, I'm Ray, Cora's manager.
- Chris Riley.

171
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:19,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Alex Fletcher.

172
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,291
- Great to meet you.
- Hi, Ray?

173
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,520
Just Ray. Cora's this way, come on.
Follow me.

174
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:29,901
C, this is Alex Fletcher
and his manager, Chris Riley.

175
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:33,162
- We loved the video. It was unbelievable.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,774
You know, I wish I brought my daughter.
She worships you.

177
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:40,070
I'm divorced. But that's another story.

178
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,575
Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure.

179
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:51,521
Your song "Dance With Me Tonight" got me
through my parents' divorce when I was 7.

180
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,816
Really? Wow.

181
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,960
Yeah, because I recorded that
when I was 9, so... Yeah.

182
00:10:56,128 --> 00:11:00,428
I want my fans to know the same
spiritual uplift that your music gave me.

183
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,966
That would be lovely. I have a few tunes
it would be nice to update.

184
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,731
Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher.
It was so long ago.

185
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:09,874
I want you to write a new song.

186
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,171
- Okay.
- You see...

187
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,312
...I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

188
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,312
We had been together
for almost two months.

189
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,544
It was a terrible experience.

190
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:23,654
But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi
called A Way Back Into Love.

191
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,653
And that will be the title
of our new song.

192
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,760
And in two weeks when I open my tour
at Madison Square Garden...

193
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,452
...we'll perform it together.

194
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,824
Okay. Here's the snag...

195
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,966
We also wanna put the song
on her new CD...

196
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,897
...which is pretty much finished,
so we need it by Friday.

197
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:40,401
- This Friday?
- Yeah, but don't feel any pressure.

198
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:44,064
We've got seven other retro artists
working on "Way Back Into Love"...

199
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,403
...so if you blow it, we're covered.

200
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:49,741
Mr. Fletcher,
don't look at this as a competition.

201
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,713
If it's meant to be, it will be.

202
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,351
It's destiny.

203
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,543
Yes.

204
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,244
Or not.

205
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,653
Okay.

206
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,094
I can't possibly write a song by Friday.
What could she be thinking of?

207
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,426
All right. Look, look,
can I be honest with you?

208
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:11,728
You're my manager.
I would have to fire you.

209
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,495
We need this.

210
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:16,869
Let's not be desperate.
We have the state fairs, Knott's Berry Farm.

211
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,031
They've canceled.

212
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:22,373
Knott's Berry canceled?

213
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,250
Look. We're still on
for the Indiana State Fair, okay?

214
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:29,251
But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.

215
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,117
- The Apple Picking?
- The Apple Picking Festival is a go...

216
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,953
...but Great Adventure only wants
three nights instead of 10. All right?

217
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,153
My God. I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me these things? Why...?

218
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:41,196
I'm telling... I'm telling you now.

219
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,267
Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP.

220
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:47,166
There's new old acts
coming up all the time.

221
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,173
Tears for Fears is going on tour.
There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.

222
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:53,140
- That's not my audience.
- Ricky Martin.

223
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,939
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I'm finished. I'm finished.

224
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:58,878
- No, you're not dead.
- I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs.

225
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,884
No, you're not. Thirteen-year-old kids
have no idea who you are.

226
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:04,248
Well, that's good to know.

227
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:07,448
What about you? You might actually
have to take on another client.

228
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:11,687
Look, don't worry about me. What we gotta
concentrate on is refreshing your image.

229
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:15,162
Then we'll get Knott's Berry
and Great Adventure. Who knows?

230
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,666
- We might even get Disneyland.
- Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable.

231
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:21,169
Tell you something, Alex.
You do a song for Cora...

232
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,433
...and there is a spot for you
in the Magic Kingdom, baby.

233
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:27,908
Writing a song. I thought I was done
with that whole nightmare.

234
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,604
Just one song.
That's all we need. One song.

235
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:32,811
But it's so...

236
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,342
...time-consuming, you know?

237
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,490
And I haven't written for 10 years.

238
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:43,094
And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked
with anyone except Colin.

239
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,162
Look, I know it's not easy
to get somebody good this fast...

240
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,391
...but there is this guy.
Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy.

241
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,729
He just worked with Avril.

242
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,702
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a bit blocked here.

243
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,244
If you don't like the lyrics,
be straight with me.

244
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:05,272
No, no, no, no.
The lyrics are very, very powerful.

245
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:09,313
Maybe you want something
more commercial? More PoP-y?

246
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,851
Just hold that thinly veiled insult
for one second.

247
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,054
- Hello.
- Hey.

248
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,632
- Khan said I could just come up?
- They were able to save the whole hand.

249
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:26,862
I know. I made too big a deal out of it.

250
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:30,303
It's just that I hate infections.
But then again, who likes them?

251
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:33,842
- Maybe the people who make penicillin.
- There's two sides to every story.

252
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:37,812
True. Except for the Nazis. I can't really see
the other side of that argument.

253
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,280
Excuse me?

254
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:42,386
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.
Hi. I'm Sophie Fisher.

255
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:46,081
Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky.
He's a noted lyricist.

256
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:51,857
Really? Well, I don't wanna get in your way.
And I can see that I already have.

257
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,693
So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.

258
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,391
She's kind of hot.

259
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,094
Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.

260
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,767
She's coming back in here, right?

261
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:06,274
I would imagine so. Unless she goes
directly back to the mother ship.

262
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:08,709
How about:

263
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:12,014
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

264
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,845
I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch

265
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,080
I can scream and claw
And curdle your blood

266
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:22,693
But you'll die on your way back into love

267
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,687
No. Start on a minor third. Try that.

268
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,333
Right. So:

269
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,095
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

270
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,965
I look real good, but I'm a nasty...

271
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,834
Come on. You're missing the point.

272
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:40,034
From the first line.
"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch" is okay.

273
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,508
But then it should be...

274
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,741
But with some magic, I just might switch

275
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:52,712
Sorry. What did you say?

276
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,950
I don't remember.

277
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:01,263
I think it was,
"But with some magic, I just might switch."

278
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,129
- That is actually quite intriguing.
- That's not my lyric.

279
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,031
No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase.

280
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:08,968
Look, if you can't handle anything
except moon and June...

281
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,974
...why don't we just let
plant girl finish the lyrics?

282
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:14,406
Plant girl.

283
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,173
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

284
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:19,578
But with some magic, I just might switch

285
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:23,551
- Finish it.
- I'm just here to cater to the plants.

286
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,815
And you are doing a fine job,
if I may say so.

287
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,582
Although that one is plastic.

288
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:31,423
This is a waste of time.

289
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,356
Let's fly my broom to the stars above

290
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,367
And we'll charm our way back into love

291
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:47,840
What's the next line,
"Feelings, nothing more than feelings"?

292
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,474
You people disgust me.

293
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:57,151
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I have no filtering system.

294
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:58,687
No. That's fine, that's fine.

295
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:01,257
He had to get back to his job
at Hallmark anyway.

296
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,860
Listen, have you ever done any writing?

297
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:07,225
I mean, everybody's done some writing,
you know? Well, not everybody.

298
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,628
Illiteracy is a growing epidemic
in this country.

299
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,325
I write slogans for Weight-Not...

300
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,199
...this weight reduction company
that my sister runs.

301
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,704
Did you ever hear of the band PoP?

302
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,868
Yeah, of course, everybody has.
My sister Rhonda loved them.

303
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:24,071
They had that ridiculous hair
and those ridiculous outfits and...

304
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:25,739
Oh, my God, you're one of them.

305
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,016
That hair was very much in style then.

306
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:31,155
- I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine.

307
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,416
But I would love to talk to you
about maybe writing some lyrics.

308
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:35,986
But I don't write lyrics.

309
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:39,187
Well, we could just kick some ideas around,
repot the ficus.

310
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:41,662
I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer, though.

311
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,495
I have to go babysit for my sister now.
I mean, her kids.

312
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:48,298
She's 38 now, so... Thank you.

313
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,834
Okay, listen.
Do you know who Cora Corman is?

314
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,638
Oh, yeah. My niece loves her.

315
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:58,010
Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her,
so if you change your mind...

316
00:17:58,183 --> 00:18:02,119
...and the idea of working with me is
of any interest at all, please just call, okay?

317
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,723
Or if you just fancy a good laugh,
I am performing at the Hilton tonight.

318
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,257
Well, thank you.
I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry.

319
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:12,419
"I just can't," she says mysteriously.
But I just can't.

320
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,031
- I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer.
- Yes.

321
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,864
Oh, my God.

322
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:24,634
Go to the next level, weirdo.

323
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,175
You have to go to the next level.

324
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,942
It's your parents. Go get into bed.
Get into bed. This is not a drill.

325
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:34,881
- But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
- Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.

326
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,052
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:39,053
- How was the movie?
- I enjoyed it.

328
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:41,055
- He fell asleep.
- I enjoy sleeping.

329
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,955
- How was dinner?
- Really nice place.

330
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:46,187
It's really hard to enjoy dinner
when you run a weight-loss center.

331
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:49,333
- Lf I get fat, there goes my fiscal year.
- Honey, you're not fat.

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,526
You're not about to open a branch in Boca.
But thank you, sweetie.

333
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,968
- How'd everything go here?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Great.

334
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:57,573
The kids ate and went to sleep.

335
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:02,807
Yeah, it... They're really bad children.

336
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,706
Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed.
I'm sending your father in there.

337
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:11,083
Whoa, we're so scared.

338
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,622
And then I'm coming in.

339
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,787
I'll just go check
to make sure they're still breathing.

340
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,656
Hey, wanna do some stress eating?
Just a piece of diet cheesecake.

341
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,098
This thing happened to me today...
I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.

342
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,464
You seem so jumpy tonight.

343
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:29,106
You know, I feel a little guilty
about something.

344
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,434
How unusual for you.

345
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:32,501
Okay, listen. I have to tell you.

346
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:36,704
I met that guy from that band
you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?

347
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:37,939
Oh, my God.

348
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:41,643
Anyway, I do Jane's plant service.
I'm taking over for her while she's gone.

349
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,344
And anyway, she does his apartment,
so I was there.

350
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,046
Actually, it was the second time.

351
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,590
And he invited me
to come see him perform tonight.

352
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,557
Gary, I'm going out!

353
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:54,858
Oh, my God. I love him. I love him.
I love him. I love him.

354
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:59,132
- That really wasn't the end of the story.
- Come on. Help me dress.

355
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:01,636
Should I wear the red one?

356
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:27,256
I saw you across the dance floor

357
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,333
Out of the corner of my eye

358
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,893
I felt a connection

359
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,700
I don't know how, I don't know why

360
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:39,866
I shouldn't have stayed
When I saw you there

361
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,239
With another man

362
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,712
But as we slipped away
I thought I heard you say:

363
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:49,011
"This wasn't part of the plan"

364
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,753
Just a meaningless kiss

365
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,886
It wasn't supposed to end up like this

366
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,756
Just a meaningless kiss

367
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,300
Just a meaningless kiss

368
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,735
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

369
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,897
Just a meaningless kiss

370
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:15,569
'Till I fell in love with you

371
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:18,272
Girls, tell me the truth.
Are these pants too tight?

372
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh, my God, I gotta get up there.

373
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:24,749
And here we are two years later

374
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,322
Too late to turn back now

375
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:30,427
We've gotta finish
What we shouldn't have started

376
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,621
We gotta walk away somehow

377
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,699
But it's easier said than done

378
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:39,098
When two hearts beat as one

379
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:42,396
And three hearts are one too many

380
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,973
That's why we shouldn't have ever begun

381
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,910
Just a meaningless kiss

382
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,812
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

383
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:55,646
Just a meaningless kiss

384
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,484
'Till I fell in love with you

385
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,436
We can't go on like this forever

386
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,335
When we're not meant to be together

387
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,477
So leave me here on my own

388
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:24,479
From now on I guess
I've gotta dance alone

389
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:29,745
It wasn't supposed to end up like this

390
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,531
- Alex!
- Alex!

391
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,227
- Hello, girls.
- Alex, I'm Barbara.

392
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,703
In Boston, in 1989,
I came back to your hotel...

393
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:53,310
If you wanna see Alex again,
check his website for the tour schedule.

394
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:57,312
And the Knott's Berry Farm show
is temporarily postponed, okay?

395
00:22:57,482 --> 00:23:00,679
Great show, huh? They love you.
They're hot for you.

396
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:04,185
Of course, they're also hot because
so many are going through menopause.

397
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:08,621
Wait a minute.
Barbara from Boston. From Boston.

398
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:11,728
I do remember that Barbara. I do.
I'm going back for one second.

399
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:14,888
No. That's how we wind up
getting chased by angry husbands.

400
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,125
- Not necessarily. She...
- Hi.

401
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,666
Well, hi.

402
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:22,272
Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes.

403
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,771
Chris, you remember Sophie?

404
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:25,932
Planted in my memory.

405
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:30,606
I just wanted to apologize
for being so cryptic earlier.

406
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:33,443
- This is my sister, Rhonda.
- Hi.

407
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:39,055
I'm sorry. I've...
You were so great tonight.

408
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:42,158
We've met, haven't we? Right?
We were practically a duet there.

409
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:44,419
I know. Anyway,
could I get a quick autograph?

410
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:45,960
You may, Rhonda.

411
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,621
- Could I get a picture too?
- Only if you're single.

412
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,529
I've been married 16 years,
but nothing's written in stone.

413
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:53,033
Could you scootch? Thanks.

414
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,604
Also, I really wanted to thank you
for your offer.

415
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:58,241
- What offer?
- While Greg, the rhyming psychopath...

416
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,467
Thanks again for him.

417
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:02,909
- Was in my apartment, Sophie spouted
some really interesting lyrics.

418
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,570
I thought she was doing plants.

419
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:06,046
I'm holding a pose here.

420
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:08,378
- I appreciate it...
- I need a song by Friday...

421
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,386
...and it is amazingly difficult
to find a sane lyricist.

422
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:13,649
Why don't you just
write the lyrics yourself?

423
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,759
- That's really not a strength of his.
- That's absolutely right.

424
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:18,953
I once rhymed "you and me"
with "autopsy."

425
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,791
Well, that's not necessarily bad.

426
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,024
You could do something with that.
You know?

427
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:27,968
Figuring out you and me
Is like doing a love autopsy

428
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:31,302
- You see, you see. That's quite good.
- That's not bad.

429
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:35,536
- Go on. More. How does it go?
- I have no idea.

430
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:38,011
Someone could have sculpted us
in this time.

431
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:39,547
You know what? Let me take it.

432
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:42,914
They could operate all day long
And never figure out what went wrong

433
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:45,954
My God, you are...
You are Cole Porter in panties.

434
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:49,615
Of course, having said that,
Cole Porter probably did wear panties.

435
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:52,285
Anyway, thank you for inviting us.

436
00:24:52,463 --> 00:24:56,695
Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one.
Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie.

437
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,635
- Thank you so much. That was great.
- Hang on.

438
00:24:59,804 --> 00:25:01,931
Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.

439
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,570
So this is where Sophie works, eh?

440
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,715
Yeah. She is gonna be right out.

441
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:14,112
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

442
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:17,816
So how much do you weigh?

443
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:19,721
I fluctuate. Yeah.

444
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,954
Okay, look, I am terribly sorry
to barge in like this...

445
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,860
...but I have decided
I cannot take no for an answer.

446
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,864
- I told you that...
- You're not a writer.

447
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:33,503
Except when you are writing poems
and short stories...

448
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,468
...in the New School literary magazine.

449
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,301
I Googled you. And you were good.

450
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,067
Look, I'm flattered.

451
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:43,202
I mean, you're one of six people
in the world who's actually read those...

452
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,747
...but that doesn't mean
I can write a song.

453
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:50,278
You already did.
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

454
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:54,649
Please, step in. You'll enjoy this.
This is a treat.

455
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:56,960
Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you.

456
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:59,528
- Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you?
- Wonderful.

457
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:02,165
I just want to get...
Can I try the new Mason & Hamlin?

458
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,996
- Sure, absolutely. Be my guest.
- Thank you very much. Thanks. Please.

459
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,436
This is... It's just a little something
that you might possibly recognize.

460
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:15,139
Figuring out you and me

461
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:19,943
Is like doing a love autopsy

462
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:23,086
They could operate all day long

463
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:26,815
And never figure out what went wrong

464
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,289
Love autopsy

465
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,056
Love autopsy

466
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,137
What went wrong?

467
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,041
God. That melody is so beautiful.

468
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:56,209
But I've never written a song.

469
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:58,787
A song. I know, I know.
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

470
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:02,983
I just don't think I am.
I think you may be a born lyricist.

471
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:08,793
We don't have very long,
but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

472
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,558
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

473
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:13,533
But I think it's gonna be very hard
to get back from there...

474
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:16,764
...into "Way Back Into Love,"
which is the title that Cora demands.

475
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:20,707
What we could do is continue
with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

476
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:22,243
That's plagiarism.

477
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:24,506
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

478
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:27,276
I would never in a million years
use someone else's work.

479
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,645
I'm very glad you agree.

480
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:34,416
So, what we need,
we need something brand-new.

481
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:38,927
- So let's see. A song for Cora.
- Yes.

482
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:42,896
- Has to be called "A Way Back Into Love."
- Correct.

483
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,365
And it has to be something
Cora would sing about.

484
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,798
Good.

485
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:49,132
And it has to be something
you would sing about.

486
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:50,466
Good, yeah.

487
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,804
- What would you sing about?
- Whatever gets me the job, really.

488
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:56,744
Oh, that's inspiring.

489
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:06,556
Okay. Two people
searching for love, for salvation.

490
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,021
Good, good, I love that.

491
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:11,559
Love lost, love found.

492
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,527
Love lost again.

493
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:17,326
Yes, this is starting to sound
a little bit like luggage, but good.

494
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,578
Thanks. That's really helpful.

495
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:40,521
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Just spit it out.

496
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:43,091
- They're just lyrics.
- "Just lyrics"?

497
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:47,723
Lyrics are important.
They're just not as important as melody.

498
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:50,727
I really don't think you get it.

499
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:53,067
Oh, you look angry. Click your pen.

500
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:56,172
A melody is like seeing someone
for the first time.

501
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,205
The physical attraction. Sex.

502
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:00,674
I so get that.

503
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,973
But then, as you get to know the person,
that's the lyrics.

504
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:06,776
Their story. Who they are underneath.

505
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:11,717
It's the combination of the two
that makes it magic.

506
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,481
Let's go for a walk.

507
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:16,626
- A walk? What, now?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:21,128
Out on the streets you see things
and, you know, hear things and eat things.

509
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,789
It all sort of unlocks your mind.

510
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,167
This is good. This is good.

511
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:32,605
When you hit a wall,
you gotta change the subject.

512
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,073
So why did PoP break up?

513
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:37,043
I mean, Rhonda told me
that you guys were friends growing up?

514
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:39,546
We were, yes,
and then Colin met a new manager...

515
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,947
...who convinced him
he was the star of the band.

516
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,611
Shortly after, he left, taking the last
three songs we'd written together...

517
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,555
...and putting them on his solo album
which went on to sell eight million records.

518
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:52,389
But how did you deal with that?

519
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:54,497
Oh, with drugs, alcohol...

520
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:58,692
...and ultimately, my own solo album.

521
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:04,635
Cool.

522
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,368
This copy has been in the racks
for six years.

523
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:09,274
- Come on.
- No, no. I check every week.

524
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:11,914
You see, I made a little mark,
there on the back. See?

525
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:14,915
It sold only 50,000 copies,
most of those to my mother.

526
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:17,645
Rolling Stone called it
"a crass, contrived effort...

527
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:20,346
...not even good enough
for a dentist chair."

528
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:24,020
Well, I'm sure there were other reviews.

529
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:26,594
There were, there were.
But none as good as that one.

530
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:28,698
And they were right, by the way. Yeah.

531
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,693
To cut a long story short,
I gave up trying to write...

532
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:36,635
...lost an incredible amount of money
and then my apartment.

533
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,833
Chris stuck by me, booked me
an '80s reunion night on Long Island.

534
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,103
And suddenly, they liked me again.

535
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,509
It was weird.
It was like I'd never been away.

536
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:46,582
The audience was a tad older, as was I...

537
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,015
...but we were very, very profoundly happy
to see each other again.

538
00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:53,020
And it went on from there.

539
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,717
Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm,
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

540
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:00,591
Busch Gardens,
that's one of my big fixtures of the year.

541
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,095
What else can I tell you?

542
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,793
I really appreciate
you opening up to me like this.

543
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:10,365
I know what it's like
to live with a shadow overhead.

544
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:15,306
What?

545
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:18,875
Shadow.

546
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:24,180
I've been living with a shadow overhead

547
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:27,352
Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?

548
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:29,321
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:32,018
Mind you, what do you know?
You don't even like melody.

550
00:31:32,196 --> 00:31:33,857
I never said that.

551
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,931
You prefer the lyrics.

552
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,158
I don't trust you.

553
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,699
Your turn, what's next?

554
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,002
I think that we should get
some breakfast.

555
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,970
Please, come on, we're finally
on a roll here. Listen again.

556
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:48,908
I've been living with a shadow overhead

557
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,242
There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed

558
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,940
Please, seriously, seriously.

559
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:56,211
I've been living with a shadow overhead

560
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:59,220
I could be inspired
With just a piece of bread

561
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:02,016
- I have the perfect place.
- Wait a minute.

562
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:03,523
It's just on the next corner.

563
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,594
- Keep moving and keep writing.
- All right.

564
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:09,324
I've been looking
For someone to shed some light

565
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,664
- That's good. That's good.
- Yeah?

566
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,700
Shadows and light. You're deep.

567
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:16,704
Okay, we need two more lines
of Cora verse. What's next?

568
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:18,205
Soph?

569
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:22,100
Sophie?

570
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,206
What are you doing?

571
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:26,781
Nothing.

572
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,943
I thought I saw someone,
but it wasn't him. So it's fine.

573
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:34,522
- Oh, there he is.
- What?

574
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,661
A very nice picture, though.
That's funny.

575
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:41,762
Interestingly enough, I mean...
Well, it is a bookstore.

576
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:44,093
- So, you know, that does happen.
- What?

577
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,660
Gosh, where were we? Okay.

578
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:49,135
Shadow overhead

579
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:53,140
Okay, can I just say, with all due respect,
that you are clearly...

580
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,278
What is the word?
- Insane at this moment.

581
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:58,279
And because, according to Chris,
we have less than 36 hours...

582
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:01,577
...before Cora goes to do Leno,
at which point my career is over...

583
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:07,156
...it would be infinitely better for me
if you were sane. So how can I help?

584
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:11,187
Do you know this book?

585
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:17,329
Sally Michaels? Yes, yes.
Big bestseller. Yes.

586
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:19,594
- Have you read it?
- No, of course not.

587
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,831
Last book I read was The Alex Fletcher Story
by the editors of Teen Dream Magazine.

588
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,343
Why?

589
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:34,976
I'm Sally Michaels.

590
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:41,081
I saw that they were giving these courses
on writing at the New School...

591
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,249
...so I signed up.

592
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:46,828
And my teacher was Sloan Cates.

593
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:48,988
Brilliant, handsome.

594
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,397
The truth is, I was in love with him.

595
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,195
And we began spending
every minute together.

596
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:59,172
Which is why I was sort of surprised
when his fiancee showed up.

597
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:03,971
Yeah, he never mentioned that
he was engaged to a history professor...

598
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:06,582
...who was on a year-long sabbatical
in Spain.

599
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,241
And when she popped in
for an unexpected visit...

600
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,014
...it sort of turned into a reenactment
of the Inquisition.

601
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:15,982
And that... And that was that?
That was the end of that?

602
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,253
Yeah. We never saw each other again.

603
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,659
I dropped the class and a year later,
his new novel showed up.

604
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,896
The Sally What's-it novel.

605
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,797
"The tale of a student
with exalted literary aspirations...

606
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,270
...who lures a brilliant writer into an affair
so she can take advantage of his connections.

607
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:36,109
But when he tries to break it off,
she devotes herself to ruining his life."

608
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:38,778
Well, I mean, that obviously wasn't you.

609
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:45,719
Well, she's a lit major from Long Island,
5'4", my color hair, all my habits.

610
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,915
You know, talks to herself
and asks too many questions.

611
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:51,526
Her parents founded
a weight reduction company...

612
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:53,458
...that now her sister runs.

613
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,798
Well, anyway, I...

614
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,229
Since then, every time I pick up a pen...

615
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:02,804
...l'm haunted by those words
that he wrote, you know?

616
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:05,999
"She was a brilliant mimic." You know.

617
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:08,974
"She could ape Dorothy Parker
or Emily Dickinson...

618
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,309
...but stripped of someone else's
literary clothes...

619
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:16,885
...she was a vacant,
empty imitation of a writer."

620
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:20,780
First of all, you can't listen to some jerk.

621
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:24,658
He's not a jerk.
He's a National Book Award winner.

622
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:28,229
Well, then, get the best revenge,
write a hit song.

623
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:32,329
Honestly, I don't think a pop song
is gonna impress Sloan Cates.

624
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,534
Oh, no, of course not.
Pop is just for morons. Forgot that.

625
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:38,971
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs.

626
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:41,167
You know what I'd say
to you and Sloan Cates?

627
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:43,506
You can take all the novels
in the world...

628
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,911
...and not one of them
will make you feel as good as fast as:

629
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,758
That is real poetry. Those are real poets.

630
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:59,953
Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Bob Dylan, the Beatles.

631
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,089
Okay. What if one of your heroes
came up to you and said...

632
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:06,828
You know, Smokey, what if he said:

633
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:10,804
"Alex Fletcher,
you are a horrible songwriter"?

634
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:11,963
How would you react?

635
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:15,805
I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice
a gentleman ever to say such a thing.

636
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,145
Dylan might. Dylan would, actually.
In fact, Dylan did.

637
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:25,186
Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says,
"You are a horrible songwriter."

638
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:28,854
- How do you react?
- I would be horribly depressed.

639
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,654
Yes. I would. I would.

640
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:35,491
But then, after, you know,
months of brooding...

641
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,499
...I would find a lyricist...

642
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:42,764
...and write a song
about how horribly depressed I was.

643
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,569
And it would be a big hit, everyone
would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

644
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:49,439
Suddenly I'd be less depressed
than if I just sat around...

645
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:52,980
...being a little bit self-indulgent,
letting my misery eat away at me...

646
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,053
...until I'd become an emotional wreck
and creatively completely moribund.

647
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,153
Yes, moribund.

648
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,191
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

649
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:12,598
I've been living with a shadow overhead

650
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,705
I've been sleeping
With a clown above my bed

651
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:19,433
- "Clown" is not right. What is that word?
- It's "cloud."

652
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:23,136
- Write more clearly. How can l...?
- Why would you have a clown in your bed?

653
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:25,975
- It would not be the first time.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

654
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:28,549
- Write in capital letters.
- Why don't you write it?

655
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,153
I'm sorry, Khan.
We're gonna come back in one second.

656
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:34,051
You dictate, I'll write.
And I will write like a human...

657
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:36,283
...and not like a small Pekingese dog.

658
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,588
What are you doing, you madwoman?
You're destroying my apartment.

659
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:42,027
I can't write from across the room.

660
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,997
Well, you're not writing here.
Get back to your corner.

661
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,157
I can't have you here.

662
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:49,794
- I'll be blocked. I'll be completely stuck.
- So go out the other side.

663
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,032
I've never been the other side.

664
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:56,208
Push, push. Push, push.

665
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,645
Good. Better.

666
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,948
You're still a fraction close.
Just... Just back off, just one...

667
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:08,614
Just... Just...

668
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,259
There, fine, good.

669
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:11,917
Okay.

670
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,944
And I don't think those chords are right.

671
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:33,981
It has to sound different than the verse.

672
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:36,375
What kind of different
did you have in mind?

673
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:39,317
I don't know.
Something sadder, you know?

674
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,720
And I still don't like my line
about "places in my mind."

675
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:46,090
- It's fine.
- Fine isn't good.

676
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:47,787
We only have time for fine.

677
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:50,398
I tell you what.
We'll change "places in my mind"...

678
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,967
...if I can keep the chord sequence
into the bridge.

679
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:54,569
This isn't a negotiation.

680
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:57,866
It's either right or wrong,
inspired or insipid.

681
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:01,977
It's 4 in the morning. We're not writing the
last movement of the "Jupiter Symphony."

682
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:05,171
It's a song for someone who's last hit
was "Welcome to Bootytown."

683
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:06,645
Please, get back to work.

684
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:09,513
I still don't like it.

685
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:12,348
And it's "Entering Bootytown."

686
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:16,191
And another thing,
the whole top section...

687
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:18,891
I mean, it's so close.
We're just not there yet.

688
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:21,462
We just... We have to focus
and stay, you know...

689
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:24,225
...completely understanding
of what we're trying to say.

690
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:27,461
Okay, you may now
start killing the next one.

691
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,373
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

692
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:44,819
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

693
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,722
You know, I'm tone-deaf.

694
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:16,815
Hey, what do you think of this?

695
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:20,354
Just keep writing.
Cora is leaving in an hour.

696
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,547
Listen, I was thinking that "corners"
was such a better word than "spaces."

697
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,917
For "in the mind." "The corners
of my mind," rather than "the spaces."

698
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,389
It just seems to have a better boundary
to it, you know?

699
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:00,758
Should I speak to you
about this later? Okay.

700
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:13,304
It sounds so good. I can't believe it.

701
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,239
And now...

702
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:16,879
...vocals.

703
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:20,676
No, you see, you have to sing
into the microphone. It won't follow you.

704
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,114
- But I can't.
- It's a duet for a man and a woman.

705
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:24,810
We are as close as we've got.

706
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:28,651
Your headphones and a level. You look nice.
You should wear them all the time.

707
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:31,123
How is that?

708
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:32,352
- Yes?
- Okay!

709
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:35,457
It's okay.

710
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:37,827
And...

711
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:42,471
..."Way Back Into Love." Take one.

712
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,903
Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous.

713
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,339
You'll be fine.
Just use your normal nice voice...

714
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,910
...that I've heard so much of
in the last three days.

715
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,208
It's like my throat's closing up.
It's like anaphylactic.

716
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,647
It's fine. It's just a three-minute song.

717
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:04,857
I've been living with a shadow overhead

718
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:06,518
I've been sleeping with a...

719
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:09,494
Just a little bit louder.
This song is intended for humans.

720
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:12,396
"Way Back Into Love." Take two.

721
00:42:15,438 --> 00:42:20,068
I've been living with a shadow overhead

722
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:24,873
I've been sleeping
With a cloud above my bed

723
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:28,245
I've been lonely for so long

724
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:34,155
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

725
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:39,287
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

726
00:42:39,462 --> 00:42:44,365
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

727
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,435
I've been setting aside time

728
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:53,437
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

729
00:42:54,511 --> 00:43:01,110
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

730
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:10,926
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

731
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:14,192
Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!

732
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:16,491
Hey, what if that were true?

733
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:17,655
Another one.

734
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:48,320
- Oh, my God. It's Cora.
- Okay, stay calm.

735
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,966
- C, you remember Alex Fletcher.
- How are you, C?

736
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:52,931
- Hi, Alex.
- Sophie Fisher, my lyricist.

737
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:55,071
Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually.

738
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:56,933
So Ray tells me you have a song.

739
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,910
We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough...

740
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:04,069
Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself.

741
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:05,805
Oh, we're gonna do it now?

742
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:09,509
Great, great. No time like the present.

743
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:14,020
Very rough. Just put together
in my little studio. Both of us singing.

744
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,283
She's gonna hear my voice,
it's gonna ruin it.

745
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:17,448
It's gonna be fine.

746
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:25,426
Anyone see Battle of the '80s Has-Beens
the other night?

747
00:44:25,602 --> 00:44:27,593
That Debbie Gibson,
she can take a punch.

748
00:44:33,443 --> 00:44:35,343
I didn't see it.

749
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:26,953
This is the song I've been looking for.
I can't wait to work on it.

750
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,927
Congratulations, guys. We gotta book.

751
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:31,931
Thank you so much.
Looking forward to working with you guys.

752
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:33,227
Congratulations.

753
00:45:33,403 --> 00:45:34,802
- D Money!
- Let's go home.

754
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:36,233
This way, folks.

755
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,068
It's unbelievable. We got the job.

756
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:42,106
I thank you. Thank you.

757
00:45:43,046 --> 00:45:46,140
I thank you, I thank you...

758
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:52,119
Yes? Chris, she loved it.

759
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:54,051
Unbelievable!

760
00:45:54,224 --> 00:45:56,215
Definitely. Where are you?

761
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:58,155
Okay, got it. Got it.

762
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,558
We're going to dinner. Come on.

763
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:06,968
To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved
my way back to Knott's Berry Farm.

764
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:08,865
Gloria, I love your dress.

765
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:12,030
Oh, thank you.
It's nice to clean up after a day of work.

766
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:13,334
Where do you work?

767
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,876
I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.

768
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,445
I'm working on a study
examining the relationship...

769
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:19,639
Oh, my God.

770
00:46:19,816 --> 00:46:22,307
That's a strike against us, right?
I mean...

771
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:25,613
What is it? What?

772
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:28,052
- Sloan.
- Sloan?

773
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:33,595
Mr. Cates, good evening.
How are you? Nice to see you.

774
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:35,594
I'd say about two minutes.

775
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,663
- Hi, how you doing?
- Here it comes.

776
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:43,966
Here's the thing...

777
00:46:58,788 --> 00:47:00,187
Is she all right?

778
00:47:01,925 --> 00:47:05,156
Yeah, she always does this.
It's her way of working up an appetite.

779
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:06,317
Hang on.

780
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:14,870
Hello? Sophie?

781
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:16,505
He's at the bar.

782
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:19,437
I know. I know. I know.
I saw him. I saw him.

783
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:22,737
He's not that great, you know.
I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.

784
00:47:22,912 --> 00:47:26,245
- Why, come and have a look.
- Oh, he has a great head of hair.

785
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,713
Oh, God.

786
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:30,045
I think I'll just stay in here
until he leaves.

787
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,744
Maybe you could send in a salad
and an iced tea?

788
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:36,153
Right. I'll get the waiter.
Would you like the dessert cart as well?

789
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:38,226
Look, this is ridiculous.

790
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:41,423
I've been dreaming
about confronting him too.

791
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:44,567
I had a speech prepared for over a year.

792
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:47,661
Would you like to hear it?

793
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:50,336
Very, very much.

794
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:53,838
Hello there. Good evening.

795
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:01,509
Sloan, even though Sally Michaels
only lives on paper...

796
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:03,117
...I live in the world.

797
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:06,483
And I can never forgive you
for using me as raw material...

798
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:08,681
...to create a fictional monster.

799
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:11,224
Sally Michaels
is my own personal ghost...

800
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:14,852
...a shadow hanging over each phone call
and cup of iced tea.

801
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:19,195
And one cold day, when age
has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases...

802
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:23,135
...and your hand of its dexterity, all
the success won't be able to shield you...

803
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,900
...from the pain you've caused
and the shame you deserve.

804
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,975
Or something like that.

805
00:48:28,578 --> 00:48:30,978
But now I know
I could never actually say it to him.

806
00:48:31,147 --> 00:48:34,412
No. You have to say that. You have
to say that. You have to say it now.

807
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:36,984
Now is the perfect time.
You're on top of the world.

808
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:39,553
You wrote a song
for the biggest act in the universe.

809
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,019
- But I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

810
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,852
People wait to see an ex-lover
when things are going well.

811
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:46,791
It never happens.
You can make relationship history here.

812
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:50,296
But I can't. I mean, look at me.
I haven't showered in days.

813
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:53,731
I'm covered in songwriting grime.
The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.

814
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:56,997
Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy.

815
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:01,571
Wait. Wait. Stay.

816
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:09,785
Sorry, Gloria.
Can I ask you a great favor?

817
00:49:09,952 --> 00:49:13,444
Could you accompany me
to the ladies' room?

818
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:17,916
He's a good guy. Go ahead.

819
00:49:18,094 --> 00:49:21,222
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure. Be right back.

820
00:49:29,706 --> 00:49:32,539
- That's fantastic.
- You look great.

821
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:35,906
Eleven years of therapy and I finally
help someone. Good luck, honey.

822
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,068
Thank you so much.

823
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:39,737
Yes, thank you. Thank you, doctor.

824
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:41,405
It doesn't really fit.

825
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:43,984
- No, on the contrary. It fits you perfectly.
- Really?

826
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:46,713
I'm not saying you should go
to confession like that...

827
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:49,289
...but for what you're about to do,
it's perfect.

828
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,318
Okay. Are you ready?

829
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,862
I think I'm developing
a sudden coronary blockage.

830
00:49:56,032 --> 00:49:57,431
Those pass very quickly, okay?

831
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,329
Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.

832
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:00,969
- You're fine.
- Scurvy?

833
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:03,763
You're beautiful. No, it's fine.

834
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,636
"I don't write bestsellers
because I despise humanity."

835
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:11,508
And I said, "No, John, you don't write
bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."

836
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:16,048
Should I have stopped? Should
I have stopped right there? Was it over?

837
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:20,622
Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie.

838
00:50:21,758 --> 00:50:23,953
How are you?

839
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,090
I'm fine, yeah.

840
00:50:28,264 --> 00:50:30,789
Good, it's great to see you.

841
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:35,301
- Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?
- Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?

842
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:39,669
Well, it's been an eternity.
You look incredible.

843
00:50:40,343 --> 00:50:43,938
Then you were always
mysteriously seductive, weren't you?

844
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:47,547
She is writing a song for Cora Corman.

845
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:52,420
What? No. Wait. You're a songwriter?

846
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:55,148
L... I wrote...

847
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:57,349
Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.

848
00:50:57,527 --> 00:51:00,189
A lot of people
are talking about them, actually.

849
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:02,923
I had a pen, a paper and wrote...

850
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:09,904
Sloan, the thing is, even though
Sally Michaels only lives on paper...

851
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:11,699
...Sophie lives in the real world.

852
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:13,102
She can never forgive you...

853
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:15,801
- Mr. Cates, your table's ready.
- Great, thanks, Stefan.

854
00:51:15,978 --> 00:51:19,209
Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry.

855
00:51:19,382 --> 00:51:22,112
They're throwing
this little dinner thing for me.

856
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:25,254
It's crazy how lavish people get
no matter how cheap they are...

857
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:27,446
...when Hollywood comes calling.
- Hollywood.

858
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:30,319
I've sold out. They're making a film
out of Sally Michaels.

859
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:31,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

860
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:33,856
It's been crazy. I wrote the script.

861
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,430
We're seeing actresses.
It's been... You know.

862
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,700
But listen, it's great seeing you.
Let's get together, okay?

863
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:44,969
Take care of yourself.

864
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,141
Take care, Allen.

865
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,417
Well...

866
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:58,646
...must feel good to get that over with.

867
00:52:02,758 --> 00:52:04,089
I just wanna go home.

868
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,820
Okay. Okay. Okay.

869
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:10,159
Hang on. Just hang on one second.
One second.

870
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:13,162
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.

871
00:52:13,336 --> 00:52:16,669
It would mean the world if you'd
just let her say what she came to say.

872
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,636
I know what she came here to say, okay?

873
00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:21,641
Some sad little story
about how I ruined her life...

874
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:23,278
...while the truth is...

875
00:52:26,148 --> 00:52:29,083
...that she seduced me
so that I'd help get her published, okay?

876
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:32,244
Come on. You were engaged
and you never even told her.

877
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:35,019
I'd say we're done talking.

878
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:36,624
Bye-bye.

879
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:42,195
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

880
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:44,265
Wait.

881
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:49,094
Do me a favor.
Why don't you just shove off?

882
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:52,764
I appreciate your request,
but why don't you just shove off?

883
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:56,139
- Take it easy, my friend.
- I don't believe I will take it easy.

884
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:58,942
All right. All right!

885
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:03,879
Don't hurt his hair.
He's working Adventureland this weekend.

886
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:06,613
I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.

887
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:12,084
Thank you.

888
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:14,523
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:53:14,697 --> 00:53:18,292
It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years
of doing our patented dance move.

890
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:20,560
My God, I've suffered for my art.

891
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:22,931
No, the thing that really hurts
is my upper gum.

892
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:25,437
I think I may have impaled myself
on a dinner roll.

893
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:28,543
Good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
I could've lost an eye.

894
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:30,736
Well, you should get some ice on that.

895
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:33,074
Only if it's attached to some whiskey.

896
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:36,412
Oh, God. I can't believe
you convinced me to do that.

897
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:39,679
Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.

898
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:40,844
And to top it off...

899
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,657
...l'll have my own personal nightmare
playing on 3000 screens.

900
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:47,557
And you know what the worst part is?

901
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,425
You stole some poor woman's dress?

902
00:53:49,598 --> 00:53:54,228
The worst part is that
he still has some kind of power over me.

903
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:56,428
I still care what he thinks.

904
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:58,971
I'm sorry, but how?

905
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:03,601
How can that possibly be?
The guy is a jerk.

906
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,677
Well, that's easy for you to say, but...

907
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,909
No. He is a jerk. He is a jerk.
It's not a question. He is a jerk.

908
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:13,214
No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk.
Okay, here's what I think.

909
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:16,916
I think that the truth is that you are terrified
of losing Sally Michaels...

910
00:54:17,093 --> 00:54:21,530
...because you'd have nothing to hide behind
and you'd have to stand on your own feet.

911
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,293
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

912
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:30,296
No. Well...

913
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:32,373
...I have amazing insight.

914
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:35,305
I would use it on myself,
only I don't have any problems.

915
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:38,577
And I will tell you my other insight.

916
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:42,582
I think you are way too talented
and gifted...

917
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:47,052
...and unusual to let anyone
keep you from standing.

918
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,190
That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex.

919
00:54:54,363 --> 00:54:57,093
Especially from a man
who wears such tight pants.

920
00:54:57,633 --> 00:55:00,124
It forces all the blood to my heart.

921
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,800
Listen.

922
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:14,245
You were amazing tonight.

923
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:16,413
As were you.

924
00:55:16,582 --> 00:55:19,244
The few syllables you got out
were absolutely devastating.

925
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,686
Does this feel any better?

926
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:29,321
It would if it was on the right side.

927
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:43,836
And that...

928
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:47,312
...felt much better.

929
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,835
- Hello? Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

930
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:49,599
How's my hit songwriter?

931
00:56:50,243 --> 00:56:51,608
Hang on. Just... Just hang on.

932
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:56,175
You don't sound right.
Maybe it's the connect... Hello?

933
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:58,747
I have a strange situation here.

934
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:01,148
Oh, you've got a strange situation?

935
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,620
I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife
who's here with my ex-gardener.

936
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,884
They came on a riding mower.

937
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,527
I slept with Sophie.

938
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:12,459
You slept with Sophie?

939
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:16,068
Remember your blood pressure.
You're a tall man. You need all you can get.

940
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:19,295
Are you out of your mind?
Alex, this is terrible.

941
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:23,533
Unless, of course, you're happy about it,
and then I couldn't be more pleased for you.

942
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:25,700
- Should we do pros and cons?
- Not necessary.

943
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,713
- I think she's up. I gotta go.
- We got a show today.

944
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:32,282
Two o'clock. I'm gonna pick you up
in a little while.

945
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:36,046
I want you to wear the white shirt
with the fan-friendly pants.

946
00:57:36,222 --> 00:57:38,747
Too much. Too much.
Hanging up on you. Hanging up.

947
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,614
Good morning.

948
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:44,590
- Hi.
- That was Chris just checking in.

949
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:49,095
So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit...

950
00:57:49,268 --> 00:57:51,600
...seeing as we don't
have any work today.

951
00:57:51,771 --> 00:57:53,966
Right. Fine. Thank you. Very nice of you.

952
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,576
I would obviously invite you to stay,
it's just that I have a show today.

953
00:57:58,244 --> 00:58:00,405
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yes. A big one.

954
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,980
I'm headlining
at Adventureland Amusement Park:

955
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:05,174
Long Island's family fun center.

956
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:07,819
Biggest outdoor amusement center
east of Rye Playland.

957
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:11,013
- You have my permission to be impressed.
- Sounds great.

958
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,715
- Okay.
- Yeah.

959
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:16,020
- So.
- So.

960
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:19,353
I mean, you...

961
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:23,299
You could come.

962
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:34,879
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

963
00:58:35,047 --> 00:58:39,711
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

964
00:58:39,885 --> 00:58:42,410
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

965
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:46,490
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

966
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:51,858
And I just can't let you go

967
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,023
I can't lose this feeling

968
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:59,200
Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.

969
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:05,138
Hey, come on. These guys over here on line
at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping.

970
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,845
Don't... Don't if you don't want to.

971
00:59:10,016 --> 00:59:13,042
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

972
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:18,179
y ou are gold and silver

973
00:59:18,357 --> 00:59:20,621
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

974
00:59:20,793 --> 00:59:24,320
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

975
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:30,333
And I just can't let you go

976
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:39,473
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you.

977
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:42,604
Thank you.

978
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:46,250
That was great. That was great.

979
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

980
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:51,054
Good show.
All right, you gotta do the encore.

981
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:55,087
- Do I really have to?
- It's in the contract.

982
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:57,855
Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss"
or "Dance With Me Tonight"?

983
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:00,565
This is embarrassing. They don't want it.

984
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,531
No, it's not.
These songs, they're fantastic.

985
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:06,363
I mean, I've never heard
most of them before...

986
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:10,441
...but they're full of wonderful
melodic surprises and they're catchy...

987
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:13,203
...and they're making people happy
and they're just good.

988
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:15,745
So you should be incredibly proud
to sing them.

989
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:20,585
You're not just saying that
because you've been on the wave ride?

990
01:00:20,753 --> 01:00:23,722
They're good, really good.

991
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,127
Okay, then.
"Dance With Me Tonight," please.

992
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:34,425
It's not often one man
gets to say that to another with such joy.

993
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:41,499
Thank you.

994
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:46,304
Okay. PoP face.

995
01:00:57,056 --> 01:00:58,956
Thank you.

996
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,234
It's been so long

997
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:12,200
Since I've known right from wrong

998
01:01:12,371 --> 01:01:14,168
Got no job

999
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,776
Sometimes I just sit down and sob

1000
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:23,006
Wondering if anything will go right

1001
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:28,451
Or will you dance with me tonight

1002
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:30,555
When the sun departs

1003
01:01:30,723 --> 01:01:33,886
I feel a hole down in my heart

1004
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:35,492
Put on some shoes

1005
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:39,620
Come down here and listen to the blues

1006
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:45,135
Wondering if anything will go right

1007
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:49,966
Or will you dance with me tonight

1008
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,576
I'm looking at you

1009
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:55,043
y ou're looking at me

1010
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:58,445
We're the only two off the dance floor

1011
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:00,847
Do you see what I see?

1012
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,511
Two broken lives

1013
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:05,953
Working in harmony

1014
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,821
Might make for a decent time

1015
01:02:08,994 --> 01:02:11,087
So get up and dance with me

1016
01:02:13,098 --> 01:02:15,396
It was a great show.
You should be very pleased.

1017
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:17,160
How much money did we make?

1018
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:20,328
I don't talk business in front of a non-client.
You know that.

1019
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:23,066
Actually, I'm thinking
about signing with you.

1020
01:02:23,676 --> 01:02:27,339
Well, well, thank you, Sophie.
That's... That's terrific.

1021
01:02:27,513 --> 01:02:31,449
In that case, I don't think it's right
to talk about one client's business affairs...

1022
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:34,211
...in front of another client.
I'm discreet that way.

1023
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:37,446
You don't know how much money
we made, do you?

1024
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:39,422
I have a ballpark figure.

1025
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:41,116
Is it enough for a nice dinner?

1026
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:44,126
Dinner. I'm supposed to go
to Rhonda's for dinner. I'm late.

1027
01:02:44,296 --> 01:02:46,127
Oh, God, help.

1028
01:02:46,298 --> 01:02:50,098
You know, she wouldn't yell at me
if you came.

1029
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:54,534
Oh, very well.

1030
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:59,507
I can't go.

1031
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,651
I'm losing my mind.
You've got me frazzled.

1032
01:03:09,054 --> 01:03:12,751
- Oh, there you go. You're gonna love these.
- Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.

1033
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,621
Trust me, you're gonna want
even more than that. Say when.

1034
01:03:15,794 --> 01:03:19,059
When, when, when. Thank you.
Thank you. That's plenty. Thank you.

1035
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:20,630
- One more. Trust me.
- No.

1036
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,165
Listen, now, I don't wanna be
presumptuous...

1037
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:26,202
...but I'm about to open
a new Weight-Not in Boca...

1038
01:03:26,372 --> 01:03:28,840
...and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to perform.

1039
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:32,068
Sounds wonderful. I performed
at a fat farm once. They loved me.

1040
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,644
I threw out treats from the stage.
They went crazy.

1041
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:36,280
It was like a dietetic Altamont.

1042
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,439
That's funny.

1043
01:03:39,618 --> 01:03:42,951
- Honey, no cell phones at the table.
- Could be Jessie about the meeting.

1044
01:03:43,122 --> 01:03:46,683
If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?
Don't. Sorry, Alex. Very rude.

1045
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:49,851
Weirdo, is there a way
we could go to the Cora show?

1046
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:52,224
- That would be so cool.
- We could work that out.

1047
01:03:52,398 --> 01:03:54,923
I believe we can.
I believe we've become close friends.

1048
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,795
Don't bug him with stuff like that.

1049
01:03:56,969 --> 01:04:00,302
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Apologies.
I know the rules. Turn it off.

1050
01:04:00,472 --> 01:04:03,134
Oh, no, honey. You go right ahead.
You're a guest.

1051
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:06,210
You sure? You want me
to call Jessie back while I'm?

1052
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,009
I'll be very quick.

1053
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,944
Chris, yes? Say that again.
Cora's people what?

1054
01:04:11,116 --> 01:04:12,811
What? Is it about the song?

1055
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,277
Really?

1056
01:04:14,453 --> 01:04:15,886
- What does he say?
- It's Sophie.

1057
01:04:16,622 --> 01:04:18,112
Really?

1058
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:21,021
Okay. Okay, got it.

1059
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,027
Cora is back in town tomorrow...

1060
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:26,687
...and wants to meet us at her studio
to work on the song.

1061
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:29,959
And she wants to know
if we like wheatgrass.

1062
01:04:30,135 --> 01:04:32,069
- Sounds ominous.
- Are you worried?

1063
01:04:32,237 --> 01:04:35,729
- Well, I don't... You know, yeah.
- Lf you're not worried, I'm not worried.

1064
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:39,366
You've got your worried eyes.
You look like a little worried doggy.

1065
01:04:49,888 --> 01:04:52,857
Sophie, bring those dishes in here, hon.

1066
01:04:57,863 --> 01:05:00,991
Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow.

1067
01:05:05,337 --> 01:05:07,532
- There you go. There you go.
- What?

1068
01:05:08,073 --> 01:05:09,665
Nothing. Just looking.

1069
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,674
What? What? What, what, what?

1070
01:05:13,846 --> 01:05:17,441
- Well, look. As your older sister...
- Seven years older.

1071
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:18,981
Now, that's just uncalled for.

1072
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:21,745
Why do you do that?
It just... It hurts, you know?

1073
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,981
Look. I like Alex, you know.
I mean, he's Alex Fletcher. So hot.

1074
01:05:26,158 --> 01:05:27,557
And he ate my mashed potatoes.

1075
01:05:27,726 --> 01:05:29,318
Yes. It was a magical evening.

1076
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:31,690
But look, hon, you don't fall a lot.

1077
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:35,391
And I've seen the way you look at him,
so if you are falling for him...

1078
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:39,059
...just please, please make sure
he's passionate about you.

1079
01:05:39,238 --> 01:05:43,572
Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling.
We're just working together, you know?

1080
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:47,439
And besides, the one time we slept
together, it's been totally professional.

1081
01:05:47,613 --> 01:05:49,080
- You did not.
- I did.

1082
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:51,148
You slept with Alex Fletcher?

1083
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:52,544
Oh, my God.

1084
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,380
Don't worry about it, all right?

1085
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:02,887
Besides, you know,
how do you know who's passionate?

1086
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,196
You know, I think you...
I think you just see it in their eyes.

1087
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:10,961
And you feel it in their touch.

1088
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:14,931
In Gary's case, it was when he said
to his mother, "I'm marrying her anyway."

1089
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,268
God, I hate her.

1090
01:06:18,477 --> 01:06:21,844
I don't know. I think it's just
when they do something extraordinary.

1091
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:25,306
Soph, just be careful, okay?

1092
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:26,951
Okay.

1093
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:36,450
And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.

1094
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,161
With claps, and:

1095
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:45,135
Ready to spin. And:

1096
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:53,803
Well, that was fun.

1097
01:06:53,979 --> 01:06:56,243
It was, it was, it was.
Except for those potatoes.

1098
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:58,781
What I imagine eating insulation
would taste like.

1099
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:02,848
So Cora tomorrow?

1100
01:07:03,021 --> 01:07:06,354
Yes, tomorrow, 10:00,
her studio, 19th Street.

1101
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:10,284
- Should I meet you there?
- That would be fine.

1102
01:07:10,462 --> 01:07:12,225
Although I was gonna take a cab.

1103
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:14,592
And seeing as I live
further uptown than you...

1104
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:17,031
...I could, theoretically, pick you up.

1105
01:07:17,636 --> 01:07:21,128
You could if I was on the street
at, say, like, 9:40.

1106
01:07:21,306 --> 01:07:24,332
I would probably see you, depending
how brightly you were dressed.

1107
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,410
I'd wear orange so you couldn't miss me.

1108
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:28,842
You could get some road work done
while you wait.

1109
01:07:34,753 --> 01:07:38,280
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.

1110
01:07:38,457 --> 01:07:42,086
- And thank you for your support today.
- Thank you. Today was great.

1111
01:07:43,162 --> 01:07:45,221
- It was.
- Okay. Bye.

1112
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:46,955
Goodbye.

1113
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,664
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1114
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,498
I want you to hear the new intro
to "Way Back Into Love."

1115
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:32,905
So imagine this:

1116
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:35,546
Instead of just starting the song
with the piano...

1117
01:08:35,714 --> 01:08:40,151
...we get this heavy Indian thing going,
very rhythmic.

1118
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:47,582
Derek, give me a beat:
Steamy and sticky.

1119
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:57,794
Way back into love

1120
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:02,202
She's been living
With a shadow overhead

1121
01:09:05,777 --> 01:09:10,407
She's been sleeping
With a cloud above her bed

1122
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,379
Go Cora, go Cora

1123
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:23,161
Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher
Got a new song that's gonna getcha

1124
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:26,889
Way back into love

1125
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:30,831
Way back into love

1126
01:09:32,204 --> 01:09:35,799
Way back into love

1127
01:09:38,844 --> 01:09:42,439
You know, I think that I will get
some wheatgrass after all.

1128
01:09:44,716 --> 01:09:47,412
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no, it's not that.

1129
01:09:47,586 --> 01:09:50,020
She had her eye on that wheatgrass
since we came in.

1130
01:09:50,188 --> 01:09:52,281
What you're doing,
that thing there, is great.

1131
01:09:52,457 --> 01:09:55,756
It's steamy and it's sticky, you know.

1132
01:09:55,928 --> 01:09:58,954
Which is... One is normally enough,
but the combo's just amazing.

1133
01:09:59,131 --> 01:10:00,564
C, time for the press shoot.

1134
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,863
I really like what we came up with.

1135
01:10:03,568 --> 01:10:06,867
Oh, and add another verse.
It doesn't feel like the song ends yet.

1136
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:09,200
Another verse? Right.
That would be an honor, C.

1137
01:10:09,374 --> 01:10:12,138
I'm having a little pre-recording session
party at my place.

1138
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:14,336
I want you both to come.

1139
01:10:14,913 --> 01:10:16,039
Great.

1140
01:10:16,214 --> 01:10:19,115
I think though, that...
That there... But wait...

1141
01:10:19,318 --> 01:10:21,218
Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray.

1142
01:10:21,386 --> 01:10:23,854
Thanks, Derek. Nice one.

1143
01:10:24,022 --> 01:10:26,582
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

1144
01:10:28,593 --> 01:10:32,427
You didn't actually like that orgasm
set to the Gandhi soundtrack, did you?

1145
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:35,623
Well, I thought it was,
you know, horrible.

1146
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:39,862
I mean, it simultaneously destroyed
two musical cultures in under a minute.

1147
01:10:40,038 --> 01:10:41,164
We have to tell her.

1148
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,830
No, no. I don't think we do.

1149
01:10:43,008 --> 01:10:45,238
Honestly, if she wants to dance,
let her dance.

1150
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,470
I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1151
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:52,947
Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey,
they would never let this happen.

1152
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:55,678
That's a completely different thing.
They were geniuses.

1153
01:10:55,854 --> 01:10:58,448
They wrote dinner. I write dessert.

1154
01:10:58,623 --> 01:11:00,454
No. You're better than dessert.

1155
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:03,185
That's why I'm gonna tell her
what I think at the party.

1156
01:11:03,362 --> 01:11:05,125
- You are not gonna do that.
- Yes, I am.

1157
01:11:05,297 --> 01:11:06,594
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am.

1158
01:11:06,765 --> 01:11:08,858
In that case, you are no longer invited.

1159
01:11:09,034 --> 01:11:11,332
What? She invited me.

1160
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:12,993
She invited us, as a team.

1161
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:15,935
Now that we disagree,
we no longer present a united front...

1162
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,906
...and are thus un-teamed
for the purposes of the invitation.

1163
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:20,066
So are you going?

1164
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:23,146
- I might. I don't wanna be rude.
- I don't wanna be rude either.

1165
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:25,374
You don't think that telling the hostess...

1166
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,178
...that she's destroyed
two musical cultures is rude?

1167
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:29,945
I'm enrolling you in charm school.

1168
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:32,750
I have to say what I think.
I can't work this way.

1169
01:11:32,924 --> 01:11:35,825
You can't work this way?
You've been a songwriter for six days.

1170
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,757
God created the universe in six days.

1171
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:42,161
And he never had a hit. Okay, he did.
He had "He's Got the Whole World in..."

1172
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:43,824
I'm going to the party.

1173
01:11:44,002 --> 01:11:47,062
You are not going to the party.
You, young lady, are grounded.

1174
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:49,469
You're grounded. Come back here.

1175
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:52,974
- Please. I'm a little bit desperate. Please.
- I'll see you there.

1176
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:57,013
You won't. You won't because
you're not invited. They won't let you in.

1177
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,591
- Hey, Ray.
- Alex, my man.

1178
01:12:13,765 --> 01:12:16,029
- How are you?
- I'm good, man. How you doing?

1179
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:17,463
So is Sophie here?

1180
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:20,230
You know what?
I haven't seen her. Yeah.

1181
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:21,770
- Chris?
- Who?

1182
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,170
- You know, my manager.
- I'm sorry. Have fun.

1183
01:12:24,342 --> 01:12:27,470
- Yeah.
- Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe.

1184
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:28,635
Hey, how's it going?

1185
01:12:33,585 --> 01:12:35,450
Hey, Ray, what's up, man?

1186
01:12:35,987 --> 01:12:37,614
How's it going?

1187
01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:04,070
Hey.

1188
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:05,580
- Where's Sophie?
- Hang on.

1189
01:13:06,184 --> 01:13:09,847
Hang on. God, she's here. Please
don't let her through. Don't let her through.

1190
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:12,785
We cannot let her talk to Cora.
She's gonna ruin everything.

1191
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,687
- Who?
- Sophie. She hates the song.

1192
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,351
- She hates the song you wrote?
- Yes. She hates it.

1193
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:20,726
But she wrote the song.
Why does she hate it?

1194
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:23,333
We had a little disagreement.

1195
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:25,094
Hi there, Soph, how are you?

1196
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:27,500
- Hey, Sophie.
- Good evening.

1197
01:13:27,672 --> 01:13:30,505
So you brought something,
did you, Sophie?

1198
01:13:30,675 --> 01:13:33,473
Yes. My mother told me,
"Never go to a party empty-handed"...

1199
01:13:33,645 --> 01:13:38,105
...so I went to the Zen Eatery and got
a selection of cookies. No, thank you.

1200
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:39,944
Nirvana Nougat.

1201
01:13:44,723 --> 01:13:46,884
Hey. It's my favorite writers.

1202
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:48,389
Hi, C. How are you?

1203
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,551
We brought you some cookies,
from all of us.

1204
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:53,393
Thank you. Derek.

1205
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:55,328
Cora, I really wanted to talk to you...

1206
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,968
About the fact that
we're gonna have to leave early...

1207
01:13:58,136 --> 01:14:00,798
...to finish this song
which has become important to us...

1208
01:14:00,972 --> 01:14:02,963
...in both an artistic and spiritual sense.

1209
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:05,371
You can't leave yet. Come see the house.

1210
01:14:05,544 --> 01:14:08,672
I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.

1211
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:11,042
Do you know...? Well...

1212
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:18,222
Cora, I definitely see how much
you've thought about the song and...

1213
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:21,723
Great roof. In a very interesting place
as well, right at the top...

1214
01:14:21,893 --> 01:14:25,351
- Sophie was about to say something.
- Was she? I don't think she was. No.

1215
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,556
She looks like she's about
to say something, then just... clams up.

1216
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:33,136
What I wanted to say is that I appreciate
that you're bringing thought to the music...

1217
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:37,139
...but I really and honestly feel
that we're pandering.

1218
01:14:39,511 --> 01:14:43,242
Which means trying to make others like you,
which I think is a really nice thing.

1219
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:46,111
I do a lot of it.
"Just going out pandering, be back soon."

1220
01:14:46,284 --> 01:14:50,687
The song is about the struggle, you know,
to show your true feelings.

1221
01:14:50,855 --> 01:14:53,790
And your very confident sexual display...

1222
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:57,952
...is, you know, a total contradiction
of the fear and insecurity.

1223
01:14:58,129 --> 01:15:01,292
No, I don't think so.
And my fans really love it when I dance.

1224
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:03,764
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- That's a fair point.

1225
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:07,302
- My last CD only went to number two.
- But in this case, if you trust us...

1226
01:15:07,472 --> 01:15:11,101
And Shakira is breathing down my neck.
So I wanna dance.

1227
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:15,408
You shall dance.

1228
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:20,347
But thank you for your honesty, Sophie.
Cherish your passion.

1229
01:15:20,518 --> 01:15:24,386
- Well, thank you.
- Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi.

1230
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:26,453
Nice to see you, C. Talk to you later.

1231
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,889
And I'm looking forward
to the new last verse.

1232
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,254
- Cora, wait.
- It's over.

1233
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:33,022
It was a very nice try,
but you have hit the karmic wall.

1234
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:37,259
With no help from you.
You just stood there. Talk about pandering.

1235
01:15:37,435 --> 01:15:40,097
I did not pander. I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

1236
01:15:40,272 --> 01:15:42,672
- I'm gonna go tell her the truth.
- You just did.

1237
01:15:42,841 --> 01:15:45,435
Are you gonna use flash cards this time?
You're stubborn.

1238
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,579
And you're not stubborn enough
to stand up for what's good.

1239
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:51,978
I mean, I just don't wanna see you
do what you did on your solo album.

1240
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,481
Yes, yes, yes.

1241
01:15:54,953 --> 01:15:57,421
I bought it. The last copy.

1242
01:15:58,323 --> 01:16:00,917
All right, well, I insist
on paying you back immediately.

1243
01:16:01,092 --> 01:16:02,525
9.99, right? Do you have a penny?

1244
01:16:02,694 --> 01:16:05,356
You were trying so hard to get a hit
that it wasn't you.

1245
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,623
The songs were soulless.

1246
01:16:07,799 --> 01:16:10,427
I agree. But ours has soul, so...

1247
01:16:10,602 --> 01:16:13,935
But not if we ruin it. And you know that.
Why are you so scared to care?

1248
01:16:14,105 --> 01:16:16,198
Because it won't matter.

1249
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:20,276
Because behind
all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy...

1250
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:23,710
...what she cares about
is seats filled and units sold.

1251
01:16:23,882 --> 01:16:25,543
Nothing's gonna make her your pal...

1252
01:16:25,717 --> 01:16:28,015
...any more than years with Colin
made him mine.

1253
01:16:28,186 --> 01:16:30,620
Because in the end, it's all just business.

1254
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:32,689
- What is?
- All of it. Everything.

1255
01:16:32,857 --> 01:16:34,825
That's why they call it
the music business.

1256
01:16:34,993 --> 01:16:37,757
It's a good thing.
I wish everything in life was that clear.

1257
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:40,397
I want something from you,
you want something from me.

1258
01:16:40,565 --> 01:16:42,089
No false promises or expectations.

1259
01:16:45,704 --> 01:16:47,171
Well.

1260
01:16:47,339 --> 01:16:49,569
Congratulations on your feel-good song.

1261
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,934
Can I get you a drink?

1262
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,408
There's plenty of time.
We have the night, part of the morning...

1263
01:17:24,576 --> 01:17:26,476
...teeniest little bit of the afternoon.

1264
01:17:56,007 --> 01:17:58,498
I can't read it.
What does that...? What does that say?

1265
01:17:59,244 --> 01:18:01,144
"Sorry, I can't do this."

1266
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:10,187
Sorry, I can't do this

1267
01:18:11,723 --> 01:18:15,159
Not sure about the scansion.
What...? What, are you leaving?

1268
01:18:15,326 --> 01:18:19,524
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll think of something later.

1269
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:22,359
There is no later.
She needs the song tomorrow.

1270
01:18:22,534 --> 01:18:25,469
If we don't give it to her,
she's gonna go to someone else.

1271
01:18:25,637 --> 01:18:27,002
I will have lost the job.

1272
01:18:27,172 --> 01:18:29,299
I'm sorry.

1273
01:18:30,108 --> 01:18:32,838
- Okay, look.
- No, I want to help. I do.

1274
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:35,309
I wanna help you finish, but I can't.

1275
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,780
I can't write when I feel like this.
I'm not inspired.

1276
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:44,320
I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
Inspiration's for amateurs.

1277
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:47,981
I just want four lines. Please.
I just want four lines.

1278
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,026
- I can't.
- Oh, but you can and you won't.

1279
01:18:51,196 --> 01:18:54,563
- Are you saying I wanted this to happen?
- I'm saying that's what you do.

1280
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:57,064
You push and push
and move the furniture around...

1281
01:18:57,235 --> 01:18:58,930
...and talk all the time...

1282
01:18:59,103 --> 01:19:01,537
...and screw everything up
just like he said.

1283
01:19:02,006 --> 01:19:04,668
Who's he? What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

1284
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:07,607
I read the book because I wanted
to come to you and say:

1285
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:11,510
"You're not at all like Sally Michaels."
But actually, he's got you spot on.

1286
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:15,244
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.

1287
01:19:16,321 --> 01:19:20,314
Oh, my God. Please take that back.

1288
01:19:20,492 --> 01:19:23,950
The poor, innocent, helpless
"'I can't write,' she says to herself" girl...

1289
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:26,153
...has co-authored
three-quarters of a hit...

1290
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:29,459
...and is holding it ransom
because she can't get what she wants.

1291
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:33,092
You think life is this fairy tale.

1292
01:19:33,271 --> 01:19:36,900
When it turns out that everything
doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it.

1293
01:19:58,162 --> 01:20:03,464
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1294
01:20:04,736 --> 01:20:06,260
Slam

1295
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:10,605
- C, Alex Fletcher is here.
- Hey, Alex.

1296
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:14,306
C, could l...? Could I have a quick word?
Thanks a lot.

1297
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:17,079
- Derek, how are you? Good to see you.
- Alex Fletcher.

1298
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:22,211
Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?

1299
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:25,015
Yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real.

1300
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:26,884
Yeah, what a girl.

1301
01:20:27,058 --> 01:20:31,119
C, hi. Listen, it's about
the new last verse.

1302
01:20:31,296 --> 01:20:34,356
It's not completely formed
in the classical sense yet.

1303
01:20:34,532 --> 01:20:37,990
It's more a kind of string of words
that you can connect in almost any way.

1304
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:40,433
- I think it's quite innovative.
- I got the lyrics.

1305
01:20:40,605 --> 01:20:44,336
Sophie faxed them over this morning.
They are so beautiful.

1306
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:46,773
It's what I always wanted to say
to my boyfriend.

1307
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:49,778
It's the perfect end to the song.

1308
01:20:50,148 --> 01:20:54,778
There are moments
When I don't know if it's real

1309
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:59,788
Or if anybody feels the way I feel

1310
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:03,018
I need inspiration

1311
01:21:03,795 --> 01:21:09,529
Not just another negotiation

1312
01:21:11,169 --> 01:21:16,505
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into...

1313
01:21:17,675 --> 01:21:20,235
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

1314
01:21:20,411 --> 01:21:23,505
I just... I just completely,
I don't know, spaced out.

1315
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:26,411
That's okay. Let's take it from the top
with the new intro.

1316
01:21:26,584 --> 01:21:28,381
Yep. Great.

1317
01:21:30,288 --> 01:21:34,384
Y eah, Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher

1318
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:36,550
Way back into love

1319
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,189
Hi.

1320
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:45,393
Hello.

1321
01:21:46,104 --> 01:21:50,006
I bought these for your children because
one should never show up empty-handed.

1322
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:54,944
They're aliens.
Clearly, I have no children. Here.

1323
01:21:55,113 --> 01:21:57,911
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1324
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:04,544
I am gonna go to the office.

1325
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:07,920
- I am too. Have fun with those.
- Bye.

1326
01:22:14,232 --> 01:22:16,496
Put them there, thanks.

1327
01:22:18,536 --> 01:22:20,265
You coming to the concert tomorrow?

1328
01:22:20,705 --> 01:22:22,764
Can't disappoint Lucy.

1329
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:25,135
Yes, yes, very important.

1330
01:22:26,044 --> 01:22:30,708
Chris is bringing his daughter as well,
so should be fun.

1331
01:22:31,049 --> 01:22:33,984
I just wanted to say
I thought your last verse was fantastic.

1332
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:35,408
Thank you, Alex.

1333
01:22:36,387 --> 01:22:38,719
And I'm very sorry about what I said.

1334
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:42,519
Well, you know, life isn't a fairy tale
and I have to grow up...

1335
01:22:42,694 --> 01:22:44,559
...and I'm gonna do that in Florida.

1336
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:47,197
Well, that's just ridiculous.

1337
01:22:47,365 --> 01:22:50,630
No one grows up in Florida.
Unless they're an orange.

1338
01:22:50,802 --> 01:22:53,600
Well, I'm managing
the new Weight-Not branch in Boca Raton.

1339
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:56,433
You should be writing,
not fighting cellulite.

1340
01:22:56,607 --> 01:22:59,167
Well, I can do both.
We need a new marketing campaign.

1341
01:22:59,343 --> 01:23:01,106
Swimsuit season is coming up.

1342
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,272
Thing is...

1343
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,776
...I can't...

1344
01:23:11,355 --> 01:23:13,653
...compose without you.

1345
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:16,692
Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea.

1346
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:23,431
All right. You're obviously very busy.

1347
01:23:28,873 --> 01:23:30,465
Good luck.

1348
01:23:31,309 --> 01:23:32,606
You too.

1349
01:25:19,884 --> 01:25:21,545
Cora!

1350
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:28,753
- Gracie, aren't you excited?
- Let's go.

1351
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:34,454
You know what? You guys, just go.
I think I'm gonna skip it.

1352
01:25:34,632 --> 01:25:37,100
- No, come on. You can't skip it.
- You know what, kids?

1353
01:25:37,268 --> 01:25:39,736
I'm gonna talk to your aunt, okay?
Gary, take them in.

1354
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:41,929
- Should I meet you...?
- Do it. How hard is it?

1355
01:25:42,106 --> 01:25:43,596
- Go, walk, sit.
- Find your seats.

1356
01:25:43,774 --> 01:25:46,709
Honey, I need a second. Thank you.
Love you. You're a good man.

1357
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:48,072
Now, listen to me.

1358
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:52,808
Those kids have told all of their friends
that their aunt wrote Cora's new hit song.

1359
01:25:52,984 --> 01:25:55,578
And they wanna share this with you.
You gotta go in.

1360
01:25:55,753 --> 01:25:58,688
Yeah. No, I know. I know. I just...

1361
01:25:58,856 --> 01:26:02,587
I don't know how I'm gonna go in there
and look at him.

1362
01:26:03,794 --> 01:26:06,991
I know. It's just one night, though,
and I really think you need this.

1363
01:26:07,164 --> 01:26:11,692
And then he'll go his way
and you'll go yours. Okay?

1364
01:26:16,307 --> 01:26:18,537
Do you have her autograph?

1365
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:19,971
- Isn't this exciting?
- Yeah.

1366
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:21,602
This is so cool.

1367
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:25,280
- Yeah, weirdo. This is so cool.
- It's great.

1368
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:27,781
We're in the Cora fan club.
Can we? Please, Mom?

1369
01:26:27,952 --> 01:26:30,648
- Okay.
- Cora!

1370
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,444
Cora!

1371
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:55,840
Cora!

1372
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:08,051
Cora!

1373
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:35,881
- Look, there she is!
- Is that Cora?

1374
01:27:52,403 --> 01:27:53,802
I'm starting to believe, boy

1375
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:56,405
That this was meant to be, boy

1376
01:27:56,574 --> 01:27:59,236
'Cause I believe in karma

1377
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,878
Boy, do you believe in karma?

1378
01:28:04,749 --> 01:28:08,708
Each time you put your lips to mine
It's like a taste of Buddha's delight

1379
01:28:08,886 --> 01:28:14,620
- Hey, Gary.
- Come on. I'm just watching.

1380
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,752
Tell me all your fantasies tonight

1381
01:28:18,929 --> 01:28:20,521
And I will make them happen 'cause

1382
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:25,226
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

1383
01:28:25,403 --> 01:28:27,769
My Buddha's delight

1384
01:28:28,506 --> 01:28:31,236
Om shanti, shanti

1385
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:38,839
This Tuesday on The CW,
it's Battle of the '80s Has-Beens...

1386
01:28:39,016 --> 01:28:42,247
...featuring Tiffany battling
reigning champion Debbie Gibson...

1387
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,082
...followed by a bout
between Adam Ant and Billy Idol.

1388
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:48,823
Tuesday night on The CW.

1389
01:28:50,227 --> 01:28:52,559
Five minutes, Mr. Fletcher.

1390
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:59,795
Entering Bootytown
So shake my booty now

1391
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:05,567
'Cause your booty
Is the way into his heart

1392
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:22,051
New York, I love you!

1393
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:25,557
Shanti, shanti.

1394
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:26,923
What's that mean?

1395
01:29:27,098 --> 01:29:30,033
And now I'd like you to hear
something very special.

1396
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:33,227
- Oh, Soph.
- Something very different.

1397
01:29:33,404 --> 01:29:34,871
It's a new song.

1398
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:37,030
This is it, weirdo, your song.

1399
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:41,676
- I don't think I can listen to this.
- A song no one has heard before...

1400
01:29:41,846 --> 01:29:45,475
...written by Mr. Alex Fletcher.

1401
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:46,638
Wait.

1402
01:29:52,656 --> 01:29:55,784
What? Alex Fletcher and my sister.

1403
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,359
How quickly they forget.

1404
01:29:58,562 --> 01:30:01,395
Let's just go and come back
when the song's over. You and me.

1405
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:05,498
- Actually, I'm gonna go.
- No. What?

1406
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:07,694
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Just...
- Are you sure?

1407
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:11,103
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.
Just take care of the kids.

1408
01:30:32,196 --> 01:30:34,926
It's never been easy for me

1409
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:40,465
To find words to go along with a melody

1410
01:30:43,607 --> 01:30:47,976
But this time there's actually
Something on my mind

1411
01:30:50,014 --> 01:30:54,610
So please forgive
These few brief awkward lines

1412
01:30:56,787 --> 01:31:00,780
Since I met you
My whole life has changed

1413
01:31:03,194 --> 01:31:07,722
It's not just my furniture
y ou've rearranged

1414
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:15,600
I was living in the past
But somehow you've brought me back

1415
01:31:16,106 --> 01:31:21,601
And I haven't felt like this
Since before Frankie said, "Relax"

1416
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:24,270
And though I know

1417
01:31:24,448 --> 01:31:27,417
Based on my track record

1418
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:30,577
I might not seem like the safest bet

1419
01:31:34,024 --> 01:31:36,288
All I'm asking you

1420
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:40,762
Is don't write me off just yet

1421
01:31:52,276 --> 01:31:56,269
For years I've been telling myself
The same old story

1422
01:31:58,482 --> 01:32:03,044
That I'm happy to live off
My so-called former glories

1423
01:32:04,922 --> 01:32:10,861
But you've given me a reason
To take another chance

1424
01:32:11,362 --> 01:32:16,823
Now I need you despite the fact
That you've killed all my plants

1425
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:19,226
And though I know

1426
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:22,429
I've already blown more chances

1427
01:32:22,606 --> 01:32:25,632
Than anyone should ever get

1428
01:32:29,546 --> 01:32:32,037
All I'm asking you

1429
01:32:32,216 --> 01:32:35,982
Is don't write me off just yet

1430
01:32:39,256 --> 01:32:43,818
Don't write me off just yet

1431
01:33:01,412 --> 01:33:03,039
Alex!

1432
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:27,629
- Nobody backstage.
- I have to get up there. I know Cora.

1433
01:33:27,805 --> 01:33:30,603
- I don't care what you want.
- I know Cora. I wrote this song.

1434
01:33:30,774 --> 01:33:31,763
She's okay.

1435
01:33:31,942 --> 01:33:34,376
- There's nobody backstage.
- I said she's okay, right?

1436
01:33:34,545 --> 01:33:36,536
- Well, you vouch for her, then.
- Thank you.

1437
01:33:36,714 --> 01:33:37,806
What's wrong with you?

1438
01:33:37,981 --> 01:33:40,506
As soon as Cora's done "Slam,"
we'll need you on-stage.

1439
01:33:40,684 --> 01:33:43,118
Okay, got it. Got it.
Thanks very much. Cheers.

1440
01:33:44,755 --> 01:33:46,780
Slam

1441
01:33:47,391 --> 01:33:52,795
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1442
01:33:54,098 --> 01:33:55,258
Slam

1443
01:33:57,201 --> 01:33:59,066
Come to a concert, don't bring anything?

1444
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:02,731
Alex, that song.

1445
01:34:02,906 --> 01:34:06,171
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It's the best I could do. You could fix it.

1446
01:34:06,343 --> 01:34:09,437
No. That song was dinner.

1447
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:15,180
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can

1448
01:34:18,689 --> 01:34:19,815
Thank you!

1449
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,420
I want you to hear my new single.

1450
01:34:27,264 --> 01:34:28,993
Thank you!

1451
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:33,933
"Way Back Into Love," music and lyrics
by Sophie Fisher and Alex Fletcher.

1452
01:34:34,104 --> 01:34:36,572
What happened to steamy and sticky?

1453
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:39,766
I explained to Cora that it violated
the very core of the lyric...

1454
01:34:39,943 --> 01:34:41,808
...and corrupted the purity of the song.

1455
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:44,914
When that didn't work, I told her
it would help me win you back.

1456
01:34:45,082 --> 01:34:46,344
And that did it.

1457
01:34:46,517 --> 01:34:50,851
Turns out that although she thought
the Dalai Lama was, incredibly, a llama...

1458
01:34:51,021 --> 01:34:53,216
...she is, in fact, quite the romantic.

1459
01:34:53,957 --> 01:34:55,857
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay, Mr. Fletcher.

1460
01:34:56,026 --> 01:34:57,493
Thank you.

1461
01:34:57,661 --> 01:35:02,860
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

1462
01:35:03,033 --> 01:35:07,561
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

1463
01:35:07,738 --> 01:35:12,539
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

1464
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:15,701
I've been setting aside time

1465
01:35:16,713 --> 01:35:21,844
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

1466
01:35:22,853 --> 01:35:28,849
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1467
01:35:32,529 --> 01:35:39,492
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1468
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,670
I've been watching
But the stars refuse to shine

1469
01:35:50,848 --> 01:35:55,683
I've been searching
But I just don't see the signs

1470
01:35:55,853 --> 01:35:59,584
I know that it's out there

1471
01:35:59,756 --> 01:36:05,023
There's gotta be something
For my soul somewhere

1472
01:36:05,195 --> 01:36:09,393
I've been looking for someone
To shed some light

1473
01:36:09,566 --> 01:36:13,866
Not somebody just to get me
Through the night

1474
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,264
I could use some direction

1475
01:36:19,076 --> 01:36:23,172
And I'm open to your suggestions

1476
01:36:24,047 --> 01:36:30,714
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1477
01:36:33,423 --> 01:36:39,953
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1478
01:36:41,064 --> 01:36:45,433
And if I open my heart to you

1479
01:36:45,602 --> 01:36:50,005
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do

1480
01:36:50,173 --> 01:36:54,337
And if you help me to start again

1481
01:36:55,445 --> 01:37:02,351
y ou know that I'll be there
For you in the end

1482
01:44:02,605 --> 01:44:04,596
