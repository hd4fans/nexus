00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,850
哈利・波特

8
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,850
与死亡圣器(下)

9
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,740
多比安眠于此
一个自由的小精灵

10
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,000
这里真漂亮
It's beautiful here.

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,800
是我姑妈的房子  我们小时候常来这里
It was our aunt's. We used to come here as kids.

12
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,580
凤凰社现在把它当做藏身之所
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

13
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,130
我们只能尽这点微薄之力了
What's left of us at least.

14
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,810
麻瓜认为这种东西能辟邪
Muggles think these things keep evil away.

15
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,390
但其实不是
But they're wrong.

16
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,250
我得跟妖精谈谈
I need to talk to the Goblin.

17
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,400
你还好吗
How are you?

18
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,830
还活着
Alive.

19
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,110
你可能不记得了
You probably don't remember that you...

20
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,350
你第一次去古灵阁时
That I showed you to your vault,

21
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,700
是我领你们去的金库吗
the first time you came to Gringotts.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,420
哈利・波特  即使在妖精中间  你也很出名
Even amongst Goblins, you are famous Harry Potter.

23
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,690
你埋葬了那只小精灵
You buried the elf?

24
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,450
是的
Yes.

25
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,740
并把我带到这里
And brought me here.

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
你真是个
You are...

27
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,660
与众不同的巫师
...pretty unusual wizard.

28
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,400
你怎么得到那把宝剑的
How did you come by the sword?

29
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,360
一言难尽
It's complicated.

30
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,180
为什么贝拉特里克斯・莱斯特兰奇说
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange

31
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,890
这把剑应该在她的古灵阁金库里
think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

32
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,100
一言难尽
It's complicated.

33
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,320
宝剑在危机时刻适时地出现在我们面前
The sword presented itself to us, in moment of need.

34
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,190
不是我们偷来的
We didn't steal it.

35
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,650
在莱斯特兰奇夫人的金库里
There is a sword in Madam lestrange's vault

36
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,770
有把一模一样的宝剑
identical to this one.

37
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,110
但那把是假的
But it is a fake.

38
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,040
是今年夏天放进去的
It was placed there this past summer.

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,740
她从未怀疑过它的真伪吗
And she never suspected it was a fake.

40
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,030
那个仿制品很逼真
The replica is very convincing.

41
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,710
只有妖精能鉴别出
Only a goblin would recognize

42
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,790
真正的格兰芬多宝剑
that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

43
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,530
还有谁知道这事
Who is the acquaintance?

44
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,530
一位霍格沃茨的教授
A Hogwarts Professor.

45
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,570
据我所知  他现在是霍格沃茨的校长
As I understand that he's now Headmaster.

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,390
斯内普
Snape.

47
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,900
他把假宝剑放在贝拉特里克斯的金库里
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.

48
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,910
为什么呢
Why?

49
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,530
在古灵阁的金库里
There are more than a few

50
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,060
存放着许多稀奇古怪的东西
curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.

51
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,120
莱斯特兰奇的金库也是如此吗
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,450
也许吧
Perhaps.

53
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,470
我要潜入古灵阁
I need to get into Gringotts.

54
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,260
进入其中一个金库
Into one of the vaults.

55
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,270
这不可能
It is impossible.

56
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,560
单凭我  的确不行
Alone, yes.

57
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,800
但如果你帮我  就有可能
But with you, no.

58
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,990
-我凭什么帮你  -我有金子
- Why should I help you? - I have gold.

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
很多金子
Lots of it.

60
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,390
我对金子不感兴趣
I've no interest in gold.

61
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,610
那你想要什么
Then what?

62
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,970
那把剑
That.

63
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,790
这就是我开的价格
That is my price.

64
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,760
你认为贝拉特里克斯的金库里藏着魂器吗
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,400
她误以为我们进了金库时特别慌张
Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.

66
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,450
不停地问你还拿了什么
She kept asking you, what else was taken?

67
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,920
我敢打赌  里面藏着一个魂器
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.

68
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,190
装着他的另一片灵魂
Another piece of his soul.

69
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,430
只要我们找到并毁灭它
Let's find it, kill it,

70
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,220
就离杀死他的目标又进了一步
and we are one step closer to killing him.

71
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,450
找到它之后呢
And what happens when we find it?

72
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,370
你把宝剑给了拉环
How're we supposed to destroy it,

73
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,600
那我们用什么毁掉魂器
now you're giving the sword to Griphook?

74
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,370
我也在想办法
I'm still working on that part.

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,950
他很虚弱
He's weak.

76
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,940
是谁
Who?

77
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,050
奥利凡德先生
Mr. Ollivander.

78
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,020
我想问您几个问题
I need to ask you a few questions.

79
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,310
随意问  我的孩子  问吧
Anything, m'boy. Anything!

80
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,330
您能鉴定一下这根魔杖吗
Would you mind identifying this wand?

81
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,790
我们想知道它能不能用
We need to know if it's safe to use.

82
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,700
胡桃木制
Uhh... Walnut.

83
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,060
杖芯是龙的神经
Dragon Heartstring.

84
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,330
十二又四分之三英寸
12 and three quarter inches.

85
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,750
不易
Unyie...

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,270
不易弯曲
Unyielding.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,700
这根魔杖是贝拉特里克斯・莱斯特兰奇的
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

88
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,140
小心使用它
Treat it carefully.

89
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,910
这根呢
And this?

90
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,410
山楂木制
Hawthorn.

91
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,280
杖芯是独角兽的毛
An unicorn hair.

92
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,490
十英寸
10 inches.

93
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,140
弹性尚可
Reasonably pliant.

94
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,280
这曾经是德拉科・马尔福的魔杖
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

95
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,740
曾经是
Was?

96
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,310
现在不是了吗
Is it not still?

97
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,620
如果被你夺取了  就可能已经易主
Well, perhaps not. If you won it from him.

98
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,770
我察觉到它效忠的对象已经改变
I sense its allegiance has changed.

99
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,380
您把魔杖说得好像它们有感情一样
You talk about wands, as if they have feelings...

100
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,240
好像它们可以思考
...can think!

101
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,470
魔杖选择巫师  波特先生
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,890
我们研究魔杖学问的人
That much has always been clear

103
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,700
都很清楚这一点
to those of us who've studied wandlore.

104
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,400
那您是否知道死亡圣器的事呢
And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,640
据说有三个死亡圣器
It is rumored there are three.

106
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,640
老魔杖
The Elder Wand,

107
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,260
隐形衣
the Cloak of Invisibility,

108
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,810
用来躲避你的敌人
to hide you from your enemies,

109
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,430
还有复活石
and the Resurrection Stone,

110
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,580
能使你的心爱之人起死回生
to bring back loved ones from the dead.

111
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,910
谁拥有了这三样东西就能成为死神的主人
Together, they make one the Master of Death.

112
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,900
但很少人相信这种东西真的存在
But few, truly believe that such objects exist.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,680
您呢
Do you?

114
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,660
您相信它们存在吗  先生
Do you believe they exist, sir?

115
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,330
我觉得不该去相信这种无稽之谈
I see no reason to put stock into an old wives' tale.

116
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,610
说谎
You're lying!

117
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,780
你明知其中一个确实存在
You know one exists.

118
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,430
并把它告诉了神秘人
You told him about it.

119
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,170
告诉了他关于老魔杖的事
You told him about the Elder Wand...

120
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,840
而且说出了去哪里找它
and where he could go looking for it.

121
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
他折磨逼问我
He tortured me.

122
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,590
而且
Besides...

123
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,120
我也只是讲了那些谣传
...I only conveyed rumors.

124
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,510
谁知道
There's...

125
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
谁知道他能不能找到它
There's no telling whether he will find it.

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,260
他已经找到了  先生
He has found it, sir.

127
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,710
您好好休息吧
We'll let you rest.

128
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,970
他在追杀你  波特先生
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

129
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,350
如果真如你所说
If it's true what you say,

130
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,050
他已拥有老魔杖
that he has the Elder Wand.

131
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,000
那么恐怕  你获胜的希望渺茫
I'm afraid, you really don't stand a chance.

132
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,230
那我就要在他找到我之前消灭他了
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.

133
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,960
你确定这是她的头发吗
You're sure that's hers?

134
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,640
确定
Positive.

135
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,110
看起来怎么样
How do I look?

136
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,160
惨不忍睹
Hideous.

137
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,660
把它交给赫敏保管吧  拉环
You can give that to Hermione to hold. Alright, Griphook?

138
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,190
就靠你了  拉环
We're relying on you, Griphook.

139
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,100
如果我们能躲过守卫进入金库
If you get us past the guards into the vault...

140
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,260
宝剑就是你的了
The sword's yours.

141
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,880
莱斯特兰奇夫人
Madam Lestrange.

142
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
早上好
Good morning.

143
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,210
早上好  你竟然说早上好
Good morning? Good morning?

144
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,610
你是贝拉特里克斯・莱斯特兰奇  不是小女生
You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some juvenile school girl!

145
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,790
别发这么大火
Hey! Easy!

146
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,100
如果她暴露了身份
If she gives us away,

147
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,480
我们就可以直接用那把剑自刎了
we must swear to use that sword to slit our own throats.

148
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,090
懂了吗
Understand?

149
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,860
他说得对
No, he's right.

150
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,520
我犯傻了
I speak stupid.

151
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,210
好了  走吧
Okay. Let's do it.

152
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,030
我要进入我的金库
I wish to enter my vault.

153
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,620
请出示身份证明
Identification?

154
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,040
我看没这个必要吧
I hardly think that would be necessary.

155
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
莱斯特兰奇夫人
Madam Lestrange.

156
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,110
我可没什么耐心等着
I don't like to be kept waiting.

157
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,170
我就知道
I know.

158
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,330
他们知道她是冒牌的
They know she's an impostor.

159
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,040
有人事先警告过他们
They'd be warned.

160
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,200
哈利
Harry.

161
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,900
该怎么办  哈利
What do we do, Harry?

162
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,060
莱斯特兰奇夫人  您能否出示您的魔杖
Madam Lestrange, would you mind presenting your wand?

163
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,620
这又是为何
And why should I do that?

164
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,200
这是古灵阁的规定
It's the bank's policy!

165
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,430
鉴于现在的时局  相信您能理解
I'm sure you understand, given current climate.

166
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,480
不  我当然不能理解
No! I most certainly do not understand!

167
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,920
恐怕我要坚持原则
I'm afraid, I must insist.

168
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,810
魂魄出窍
Imperio!

169
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,280
很好  莱斯特兰奇夫人
Very well, Madam Lestrange.

170
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,000
请您跟我来
If you will follow me?

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,700
那是什么  拉环
What is that, Griphook?

172
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,140
拉环
Griphook!

173
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,950
减缓下落
Aresto Momentum.

174
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,690
干得好  赫敏
Well done, Hermione.

175
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,880
糟了  你俩变回以前的样子了
Oh no, you two're like you again.

176
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,270
防贼瀑布  能洗掉所有的魔咒
The Thief's Downfall, washes away all enchantments.

177
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,890
有时候相当致命
Can be deadly.

178
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,010
还用你说
You don't say.

179
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,160
就是好奇问一句  还有别的方式出去吗
Just out of interest, is there any other way out of here?

180
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,940
没有
No.

181
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,980
你们几个在这里做什么
What the devil are all you doing down here?

182
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,510
小偷
Thieves!

183
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,940
你背弃了
You gave up the...

184
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,870
-魂魄出窍  -你
- Imperio. - You!

185
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,670
听起来不妙
That doesn't sound good.

186
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,990
我的天啊
Bloody hell!

187
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,810
乌克兰铁肚皮龙
That's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.

188
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:33,890
拿着
Here.

189
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,960
它经过训练  一听到这声音就会很痛苦
It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.

190
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,000
太残忍了
That's barbaric!

191
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,830
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

192
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,180
天哪
Blimey!

193
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,830
魂器飞来
Accio Horcrux.

194
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,090
看来还得再试一次  不是吗
It seems you're gonna try that one again, aren't you?

195
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,120
咒语在这里面不管用
No kind of magic would work in here.

196
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,070
就在这里吗  哈利
It's in here, Harry?

197
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
你能感觉到它吗
Can you feel anything?

198
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,640
就在那儿  那上面
That's it! Up there!

199
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,080
他们加施了复制咒
They have added the Gemino curse.

200
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,640
你们碰到的任何东西都会复制
Everything you touch will multiply.

201
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,200
把剑给我
Give me the sword.

202
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,760
别动
Stop moving!

203
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,420
拿到了
Got it!

204
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,580
咱们说好的  拉环
We had a deal, Griphook!

205
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,860
宝剑换金杯
The cup for the sword!

206
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,080
我答应把你们带进来
I said I'll get you in,

207
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,720
可没答应把你们带出去
I didn't say anything about getting you out.

208
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,170
拉环
Griphook!

209
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,000
有贼
Thieves!

210
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,890
拉环
Griphook!

211
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,340
有贼
Thieves!

212
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,700
这可怎么办
Is that okay?

213
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,570
至少还有博格在
We've still got Bogrod.

214
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,250
太不幸了
That's unfortunate.

215
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,850
我们不能一直躲着  想到办法吗
We can't just stand here, you got any idea?

216
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,210
你是最聪明的那个
You are the brilliant one.

217
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,750
我有个想法  但是很疯狂
I've got something, but it's mad!

218
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,340
粉身碎骨
Reducto.

219
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,340
上来啊  你们俩
Well, come on, then!

220
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,180
力松劲泄
Relashio.

221
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,980
快跑啊
Keep moving!

222
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,370
现在怎么办
Now what?

223
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
粉身碎骨
Reducto.

224
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,300
抓紧
Hold on.

225
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,190
厉害  真厉害
That was brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

226
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,640
我们在下降
We're dropping!

227
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,220
-我们跳下去吧  -什么时候
- I say we jump! - When?

228
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,430
现在
Now!

229
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,380
他知道了
He knows.

230
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,840
神秘人
You-Know-Who.

231
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,050
他知道我们闯进了古灵阁
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

232
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,220
他知道我们拿走了什么  也知道我们在找魂器
He knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

233
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,250
-你怎么知道的  -我看到了
- How is it you know? - I saw him.

234
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,910
你让他潜入意识了吗
You let him in?

235
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,470
哈利  你该封闭你的大脑
Harry, you can't do that!

236
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,060
赫敏  有时候我控制不住
Hermione, I can't always help it!

237
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,030
也许能控制  我也不知道
Well, maybe I can. I don't know!

238
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,650
先别管那个  到底发生了什么
Never mind! What happened?

239
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,580
他很愤怒
Well, he's angry,

240
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,420
也有些惊慌
and scared too.

241
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,850
他知道如果我们找到
He knows, if we find and destroy

242
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,570
并摧毁所有魂器  我们就能杀死他
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

243
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,500
我觉得他会不惜一切代价
I reckon he'll stop at nothing

244
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,840
阻止我们找到剩下的魂器
to make sure we don't find the rest.

245
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,200
还有
And there's more.

246
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,380
有一个魂器就在霍格沃茨
One of them is at Hogwarts.

247
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,570
什么
What?

248
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,260
你看到了吗
You saw it?

249
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,160
我看到了城堡
I saw the castle,

250
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,190
还有罗伊纳・拉文克劳
and Rowena Ravenclaw.

251
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,690
肯定跟她有关
It must have something to do with her.

252
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,800
我们必须马上回学校
We have to go there, now!

253
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,230
不能这样就去
Well, we can't do that!

254
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,690
我们要定个计划  好好想一想
We've got to plan, we've got to figure it out!

255
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,620
赫敏  我们哪次计划成功过
Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked?

256
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,830
每次计划好  到达目的地  都会出各种状况
We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.

257
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,490
他说的对  但有个问题
He's right! One problem.

258
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,180
现在斯内普是校长
Snape's Headmaster now,

259
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,030
我们不能明目张胆地从正门进去
we can't just move from the front door!

260
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,960
我们先去霍格莫德  潜入蜂蜜公爵
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeydukes.

261
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,570
从地下室的暗道去学校
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

262
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,490
我觉得
It's...

263
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,230
我觉得神秘人有点不对劲
There's something wrong with him.

264
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,450
就好像  以前
It's like, you know, in the past,

265
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,190
我总能读懂他的思想
I've always been able to follow his thoughts.

266
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,570
但现在都是断断续续的画面
And now everything just feels disconnected.

267
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,640
也许是因为魂器
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

268
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,990
也许他越来越虚弱了
Maybe he's growing weaker.

269
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,850
也许他快死了
Maybe he's dying!

270
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,120
不
No!

271
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,760
不  更像是他受了伤
No, it's...it's more like he's wounded.

272
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,310
他感到处境更加危险
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

273
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,160
那个男孩发现了我们的秘密  纳吉尼

274
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,670
导致我们身体日渐虚弱

275
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,180
必须倾尽全力找到他

276
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,070
而你  我的朋友  必须待在我身边

277
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,720
-这里  快点  -别放过任何一个角落
- Right here. Come on! - Search everywhere.

278
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,730
快点
Faster!

279
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,730
进来  波特
In here, Potter.

280
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,710
你有没看到他的脸
Did you look at him?

281
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,180
有那么一会儿我以为是...
For a second I thought that was...

282
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,510
我懂  以为是邓布利多
I know. Dumbledore!

283
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,830
哈利
Harry?

284
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,790
我能从镜子里看到你
I can see you in this.

285
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,310
你们这群傻瓜怎么想的  居然跑来这里
Bloody fools, what were you thinking, coming here?

286
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,980
你们知道这有多危险吗
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

287
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,810
你是阿不福思  邓布利多的弟弟
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

288
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,910
我在镜子里看到的就是你
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

289
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,180
多比是你派来的
You're the one who sent Dobby.

290
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,110
-你怎么丢下他了  -他死了
- Why've you left him? - He's dead.

291
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,220
我很难过  我喜欢那个小精灵
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

292
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,410
那个是谁给你的
Who gave that to you?

293
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,370
那面镜子
The mirror?

294
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,430
大约一年前从蒙顿格斯・弗莱奇那买的
Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.

295
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,010
顿格没权卖给你
Dung had no right selling that to you.

296
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,910
-它属于... -小天狼星
- It belongs to... - Sirius...

297
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,560
阿不思告诉我了
Albus told me.

298
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,290
他还说  你要是知道它在我手里
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,

299
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,090
肯定会火冒三丈
if you ever found that I had it.

300
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,240
但你扪心自问
But, ask yourself:

301
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,010
如果我没有这镜子  你会身在何处
Where would you be if I didn't?

302
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,170
你有和别人联系吗
Do you have any others much?

303
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,170
凤凰社的人
From the Order?

304
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,020
凤凰社已经完了
The Order's finished.

305
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,050
神秘人赢了
You-Know-Who's won,

306
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,580
对此否认的人是自寻死路
anyone who says otherwise is killing themselves.

307
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,350
我们今晚得进入霍格沃茨
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

308
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,530
邓布利多交给我们一项任务
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

309
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,880
是吗
Did he now...

310
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,060
是美差吗  简单易行吗
Nice job? Easy?

311
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,240
我们一直在找魂器
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

312
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,480
我们认为最后一个在城堡里
And we think the last one's inside the castle.

313
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,080
我们需要你帮我们进入城堡
But we'll need your help getting in.

314
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,640
我哥哥这次无疑是让你们前去送死
Which job my brother has given you now, it's a suicide mission.

315
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
给自己条活路  孩子  回家去吧
Do yourself a favor, boy. Go home!

316
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,310
活久点
Live a little longer.

317
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,160
邓布利多相信我能办成这件事
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

318
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,180
你为什么相信他
What makes you think you can trust him?

319
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,500
你为什么相信
What makes you think you

320
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,080
我哥哥告诉你的一切
can believe anything my brother told you?

321
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,350
你和他相识这么久
And in all the time you knew him...

322
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,490
他有提到过我的名字吗
did he ever mention my name?

323
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,450
他有提到她的名字吗
Did he ever mentioned hers?

324
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,990
-他为什么要...-为了保密
- Why should he... - Keep secrets.

325
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,430
你说呢
You tell me?

326
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,460
-我信任他  -那是孩子的傻话
- I trusted him. - That's a boy's answer.

327
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,560
一个孩子听他的话去寻找魂器
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the

328
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,340
可他连一点头绪都没有给这个孩子
word of a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

329
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,400
你在撒谎
You're lying!

330
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,830
骗的不仅是我  这倒无关紧要
Not just on me, that doesn't matter.

331
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,010
你还欺骗自己
To yourself as well.

332
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,680
这是傻瓜行径
That's what a fool does.

333
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,130
你可不像是个傻瓜  哈利・波特
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!

334
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,180
我再问你一次  总得有个原因
So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason.

335
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,420
你和你哥哥的恩怨与我无关
I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother.

336
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,680
你放弃抵抗也不关我事
I don't care that you've given up.

337
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,490
我信任我所认识的邓布利多
I trusted the man I knew.

338
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,300
我们今晚得进入城堡
We need to get into the castle tonight.

339
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,430
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

340
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,010
你让她去哪里
Where've you sent her?

341
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,180
你会知道的
You'll see.

342
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,170
很快
Soon enough.

343
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,050
那是你妹妹  阿利安娜  对吗
That's your sister, Ariana. Isn't it?

344
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,650
很早就死了  对吧
She died very young, didn't she?

345
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,980
波特先生  在探求力量的道路上
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.

346
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,350
我哥哥牺牲了许多
On his journey to find power.

347
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,490
包括阿利安娜
Including Ariana.

348
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,680
她爱他胜过一切
And she was devoted to him.

349
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,620
他也给了她一切
He gave her everything,

350
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,100
唯独少了时光
...but time.

351
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,210
谢谢你  邓布利多先生
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

352
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,590
他救了我们两次
He did save our lives twice!

353
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,330
从镜子里注意着我们
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.

354
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,580
不像是已经放弃抵抗的样子
That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!

355
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,900
她回来了
She's coming back.

356
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,030
和她一起的是谁
Who's that with her?

357
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,230
纳威
Neville!

358
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,150
-你怎么看起来...-惨不忍睹  对吧
- How you look... - Like hell, I reckon.

359
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,050
这不算什么
This is nothing.

360
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,580
西莫还要惨
Seamus is worse.

361
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,310
阿不
Hey, Ab!

362
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,980
还有两个人要过来
We've got a couple more coming through.

363
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,740
我不记得活点地图上有这条路
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

364
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,780
那是因为它是现在才通
That's because it never existed till now.

365
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,060
开学前他们就把七条秘道
The seven secret passages were sealed off,

366
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,170
全部封死了
before the start of the year.

367
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,990
这是唯一能进出的路了
This is the only way in or out, now.

368
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,030
学校里布满了食死徒和摄魂怪
The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.

369
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,200
斯内普的校长当得如何
How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?

370
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,240
基本上看不到他人
Hardly ever seen.

371
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,010
是卡罗在看管我们
It's the Carrows who's watch out for.

372
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,360
卡罗
Carrows?

373
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,980
对  兄妹俩  管理纪律
Yeah. Brother and sister. Incharge of discipline.

374
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,740
卡罗兄妹最喜欢惩罚学生
They like punishment, the Carrows.

375
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,160
他们把你弄成那样的
They did that to you?

376
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,610
为什么
Why?

377
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,600
今天的黑魔法防术课是练习钻心咒
Today's Dark Arts lesson was practicing the Cruciatus curse.

378
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,270
在一年级生身上练习
On first years.

379
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,160
我不干
I refused.

380
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,200
霍格沃茨变了
Hogwarts has changed.

381
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,640
逗逗他们吧  好吗
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

382
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,290
大家听着
Hey, listen up you lot!

383
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,810
大惊喜
I've for you a surprise.

384
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,630
别又是阿不福思做的菜吧
No more Aberforth's cook gonna help.

385
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,670
能消化掉那玩意才是大惊喜
We'll be surprised if we can digest that.

386
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,860
-天啊  -哈利
- Oh my! - Harry!

387
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,260
告诉莱姆斯他们说哈利回来了
Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.

388
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,740
好了  好了
Okay, okay!

389
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,620
可别抢先神秘人一步  把哈利烦死了
Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.

390
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,560
收到了吗  最新气象预报
Do you read? We've a new weather report.

391
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,940
闪电了  我重复一遍  闪电了
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.

392
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,600
有什么好差事  哈利
What's the fun, Harry?

393
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,680
好吧
Okay.

394
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,150
我们得找出一样东西
There's something we need to find.

395
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,070
就藏在城堡里
Something hidden here, in the castle.

396
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,270
它也许能帮我们打败神秘人
And it may help us to defeat You-Know-Who.

397
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,830
-好的  是什么  -不知道
- Alright, what is it? - We don't know.

398
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,340
-藏在哪里  -也不知道
- Where is it? - We don't know that either.

399
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,830
我也知道线索不多
I realize there's not much to go on.

400
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,790
压根就没有线索
That's nothing to go on.

401
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,780
我觉得和拉文克劳有关
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.

402
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,890
东西很小  很容易藏
It'll be small, easily concealed.

403
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,400
有没有谁有点想法
Anyone, any ideas?

404
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,030
有一个  罗伊纳・拉文克劳失踪的冠冕
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

405
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,330
天哪  她又来了
Oh, bloody hell! Here we go!

406
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,480
拉文克劳失踪的冠冕
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

407
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,970
没人听说过吗
Hasn't anyone heard of this?

408
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,880
很有名的
It's quite famous.

409
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,410
没错  但它已经失踪了
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

410
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,220
失踪几百年了  如今活着的人都没见过它
For centuries. There's no person alive today who's seen it.

411
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,950
不好意思  冠冕到底是个什么玩意
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?

412
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,790
是一种王冠
It's a sort of crown.

413
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,090
中间镶有一颗宝石的那种
You know, like a tiara.

414
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,120
哈利
Harry!

415
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,560
嗨
Hi, there.

416
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,470
时隔半年才见
Six months she doesn't see me

417
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,050
她居然把我当空气
and it's like I'm a frankie first-year.

418
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,450
我是她哥哥
I'm her brother!

419
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,390
她有一堆哥哥
She's got lots of them,

420
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,230
却只有一个哈利
but she's got only one Harry.

421
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,190
闭嘴  西莫
Shut up, Seamus!

422
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,770
怎么了  金妮
What is it, Ginny?

423
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,050
斯内普知道哈利在霍格莫德露过面了
Snape knows... he knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

424
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,150
很多人肯定好奇
Many of you are surely wondering,

425
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,460
我为什么这个时候召集你们
why I have summoned you at this hour.

426
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,560
据我所知  今晚早些时候...
It's come to my attention, that earlier this evening...

427
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
有人在霍格莫德见过哈利・波特
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

428
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,630
现在
Now...

429
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,000
如若有人
should anyone...

430
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,080
无论是学生还是教工  试图帮助波特
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter,

431
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,120
他们将会因此番行为
they will be punished in a manner

432
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,980
遭受严厉的惩罚
consistent with the severity of their transcription,

433
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,440
还有一点
further more...

434
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,460
如若有人获悉此行为
Any person found to have knowledge of these events...

435
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,100
而未通报的
who fails to come forward...

436
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:07,320
其罪同等
...will be treated as equally guilty.

437
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,190
另外...
Another...

438
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,200
如果有任何人
If anyone in here has any knowledge of

439
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,420
对波特今晚的行动有所了解
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

440
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,450
我希望他能站出来
I invite them to step forward.

441
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,180
现在
Now!

442
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,860
看来  尽管你极尽防御之能事
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,

443
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,840
这里还是有安全漏洞  校长先生
...you still have a bit of security problem, Headmaster.

444
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,420
而且还不小呢
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

445
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,070
你怎么有脸站在他曾经的位置
How dare you stand where he stood?

446
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,860
告诉他们那晚发生了什么
Tell them how it happened that night?

447
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,870
告诉他们你是怎样看着他的眼睛
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...

448
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,810
杀死了那位完全信任你的长者
A man who trusted you, and killed him.

449
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,800
说呀
Tell them!

450
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,790
懦夫
Coward!!!

451
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,000
哈利
Harry.

452
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,150
波特
Potter?

453
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,240
我知道你们中有很多人想抵抗
I know that many of you will want to fight.

454
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:42,250
甚至有人觉得抵抗是明智的
Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.

455
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,270
但这是愚行
But this is folly.

456
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,560
把哈利・波特交出来
Give me Harry Potter.

457
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,550
把他交给我  谁也不会受伤害
Do this and none shall be harmed.

458
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:00,210
把他交给我  学校将完好无损
Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

459
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:07,490
把他交给我  你们将得到奖赏
Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.

460
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,270
给你们一个小时
You have one hour.

461
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,810
你们还在等什么  抓住他
What're you waiting for? Someone grab him!

462
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,840
学生下床了  学生下床了
Students out of bed! Students out of bed!

463
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,100
学生跑到走廊里啦
Students in the corridor!

464
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,330
他们本该如此
They're supposed to be out of bed,

465
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,550
你这胡言乱语的白痴
you blithering idiot!

466
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,890
对不起  女士
Sorry ma'am.

467
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,840
既然如此  费尔奇先生...
As it happens, Mr. Filch...

468
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,680
你来得正是时候
Your arrival is most opportune.

469
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,490
如果可以的话  我想请你
If you would, I would like you please,

470
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,900
把帕金森小姐及斯莱特林学院的带离礼堂
to lead miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

471
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,310
我该把他们带去哪  女士
Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?

472
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,820
地牢就可以
The dungeons would do.

473
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,610
波特  我想你回来是有理由的
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.

474
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,770
你需要什么
What is it you need?

475
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,560
时间  教授  尽量帮我争取时间
Time, Professor. As much as you can get me.

476
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,590
去吧
Do what you have to do.

477
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,300
我来守卫城堡
I'll secure the castle.

478
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,410
波特...
Potter...

479
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,340
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

480
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,310
我也是  教授
It's good to see you too, Professor.

481
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,930
守住城堡  纳威
Hold the fort, Neville.

482
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,690
快点走
Hurry up! Come on!

483
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,600
哈利
Harry!

484
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,390
赫敏和我一直在想
Hermione and I've been thinking,

485
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,990
找到魂器并没有用
it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

486
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,130
什么意思
What do you mean?

487
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,720
除非我们有办法毁掉它
Unless we can destroy it.

488
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,270
所以  我们想...
So, we were thinking...

489
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,740
罗恩想  都是他的主意
Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.

490
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,980
真是绝妙
It's completely brilliant.

491
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,230
你用蛇怪的牙毁了汤姆・里尔德的日记对吧
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary with a Basilisk's fang, right?

492
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,530
我和赫敏想到  可以去密室再弄一颗
Well, me and Hermione did remind where we might find one.

493
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,350
好的
Okay.

494
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
好的  带上这个
Okay, but take this.

495
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,690
这样  你们回来的时候就能找到我
That way, you can find me when you get back.

496
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,370
你要做什么
Where're you going?

497
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,600
拉文克劳公共休息室  总得下手找吧
Ravenclaw common room, gotta start somewhere.

498
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,390
哈利
Harry!

499
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,300
哈利
Harry!

500
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,120
我再确认一下  教授...
Let me get this straight, Professor...

501
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,300
您真的允许我们这样做吗
You're actually giving us permission to do this?

502
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,320
正确  隆巴顿
That is correct, Longbottom.

503
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,400
炸了它  嘭
To blow it up! Boom!

504
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,510
嘭
Boom!

505
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,760
帅呀
Wicked!

506
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,930
但怎么炸
But how on earth are we gonna do that?

507
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,260
你去跟斐尼甘先生商量吧
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

508
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,110
我记得他有制造炸药的癖好
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyro-technics.

509
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,060
我能搞定
I can bring it down.

510
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,530
这才对  快点去吧
That's the spirit! Away, you go.

511
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,580
你应该明白
You do realize, of course,

512
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,710
我们抵挡不了神秘人多久
we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

513
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,850
但我们可以把他牵制住
That doesn't mean we can't delay him.

514
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,230
他的名字叫伏地魔
And his name is Voldemort.

515
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,080
菲利乌斯  你也该直呼其名
Filius, you might as well use it.

516
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,700
他不会因为你对他的称呼而杖下留人的
He's come to try to kill you, either way!

517
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,400
石墩出动
Piertotum Locomotor.

518
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,780
霍格沃茨正值危急时刻
Hogwarts is threatened.

519
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,800
守住边界  保卫我们
Man the boundaries! Protect us.

520
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,500
为学校尽你们的义务
Do your duty to our school.

521
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,190
我一直想用用那个咒语
I've always wanted to use that spell!

522
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,440
终极护防
Protego Maxima

523
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,380
固若金汤
Fianto Duri

524
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,750
抵挡敌方
Repello Inimigotum

525
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,990
终极护防
Protego Maxima

526
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,160
固若金汤
Fianto Duri

527
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,570
抵挡...
Repello...

528
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,520
终极护防
Protego Maxima

529
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,650
固若金汤
Fianto Duri

530
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,570
抵挡敌方
Repello Inimigotum

531
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,410
终极护防
Protego Maxima

532
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,240
哈利  等一下
Harry, wait!

533
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,030
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you!

534
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,250
卢娜我现在很忙
I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment,Luna.

535
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,850
你根本不知道该去哪儿
You don't know anything where you're going.

536
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,790
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time!

537
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,580
听着  我们以后再谈好吗
Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?

538
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,980
-哈利  -以后聊
- Harry? - Later.

539
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,370
哈利・波特你给我听好了
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!

540
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,540
记得秋怎么说拉文克劳的冠冕的吗
Do you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem?

541
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,790
她说没有一个活人见过
There is not a person alive who's seen it.

542
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,540
这不明摆着吗
It's obvious, isn't it?

543
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,140
我们得去找个死人谈谈
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

544
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,830
很壮观  不是吗
It's very impressive, isn't it?

545
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,070
要见她的话  在这里能找到她
If you've to find her, you'll find her down there.

546
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,490
-你一起来吗  -不了
- Aren't you coming? - No.

547
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,680
我想你们单独谈比较好
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

548
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,420
她很腼腆
She's very shy.

549
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,350
你是格雷女士
You're the Grey Lady.

550
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,070
拉文克劳的幽灵
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

551
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,230
我不承认这个名讳
I do not answer to that name!

552
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,990
我很抱歉
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

553
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,480
你叫海莲娜  是吗
It's Helena, isn't it?

554
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,530
海莲娜・拉文克劳  罗伊纳的女儿
Helena Ravenclaw, Rowena's daughter.

555
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,190
你是卢娜的朋友吗
Are you a friend of Luna's?

556
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,450
是的
Yes.

557
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,330
她认为你也许能帮助我
And she thought you might be able to help me.

558
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,120
你在找我母亲的冠冕吗
You seek my mother's diadem?

559
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,010
是的
Yes.

560
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,610
是这样的
That's right.

561
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,150
卢娜人很好
Luna is kind.

562
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,650
和其他人不一样
Unlike so many of the others.

563
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,620
但是她说错了  我帮不了你
But she was wrong, I cannot help you!

564
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,690
请等一下
Wait, please!

565
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,850
我想要摧毁它
I want to destroy it!

566
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,920
他们就是不吸取教训
They never learn.

567
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,110
真可惜
Such a pity.

568
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,300
但是主人
But, My Lord...

569
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,060
我们不是该等等吗
Shouldn't we wait?

570
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,990
开战
Begin!

571
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,860
海莲娜  这也是你的心愿  不是吗
I thought you want to do it. Isn't it, Helena?

572
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,270
你想摧毁王冠吗
You want to destroy it?

573
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,480
许多年前  那个人也信誓旦旦说要摧毁它
Another swore to destroy it, many years ago.

574
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,390
一个有着奇怪名字的古怪男孩
A strange boy with a strange name.

575
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:21,600
汤姆・里德尔
Tom Riddle.

576
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:22,860
但他骗了我
But he lied.

577
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,970
他欺骗了很多人
He's lied to many people.

578
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,150
我知道他是谁  清楚他的所作所为
I know what he's done! I know who he is!

579
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,610
他用黑魔法玷污冠冕
He defiled it, with dark magic!

580
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,790
我能摧毁它
I can destroy it.

581
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,400
一劳永逸
Once and for all.

582
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,930
但得靠你告诉我  它藏在哪了
But only if you tell me where he hid it?

583
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,350
你知道地点的  对吗
You do know, where he hid it?

584
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,800
对不对  海莲娜
Don't you, Helena?

585
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,530
请告诉我
You just have to tell me.

586
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,060
拜托了
Please!

587
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,120
奇怪
Strange!

588
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,150
你和他有那么一点相似
You remind me of him a bit.

589
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,300
冠冕就在这城堡里
It's here, in the castle.

590
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,270
在一个隐藏万物之所
In the place where everything is hidden.

591
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,910
你若还需继续追问
If you have to ask...

592
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,530
便永远不会明白
....you will never know.

593
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,390
你若明白
If you know...

594
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,470
便只需开口索求
...you need only ask.

595
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,440
谢谢
Thank you!

596
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,340
告诉麦格教授
Tell Professor McGonagall.

597
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,290
我和莱姆斯负责城堡这侧的防御
Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.

598
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,030
是  先生
Yes, sir!

599
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,240
迪安  我又想了一下  
Hey Dean, on second thoughts,

600
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,020
你去告诉她
tell Professor McGonagall

601
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,090
我们这边还需要一两个人
we might need one or two more wands this side.

602
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,820
一个人能否成功
It is the quality of one's

603
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,680
取决于他信念的坚定程度
convictions that determine his success...

604
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,410
而非随从的数量
...not the number of followers.

605
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,000
谁说的
Who said that?

606
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:30,950
我说的
Me.

607
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,610
弗雷德  你还好吗
You okay, Freddie?

608
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,920
很好
Yeah.

609
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:42,640
我也是
Me too.

610
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,010
开门
[蛇语]

611
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,790
哈利常说梦话
Harry talks in his sleep.

612
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,140
你知道吗
Do you know this?

613
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,360
当然不知道
No, of course, not!

614
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,770
来呀  有本事你就来呀
Yeah? You and whose army?

615
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,940
你来吧
You do it.

616
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,480
我不行
I can't.

617
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,430
你行的
Yes, you can!

618
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,620
纳威
Neville!

619
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:39,690
计划成功了
That went well.

620
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,960
快进去  这边走  找掩护
Get inside! This way! Take cover! Take cover

621
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:49,800
昏昏倒地
Stupefy

622
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:57,050
金妮  纳威  你们没事吧
Ginny, Neville! You alright?

623
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,050
好极了
Never better!

624
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,100
我觉得自己都可以喷火了
I feel like I can spit fire!

625
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,700
你见到卢娜了吗
Have you seen Luna up here?

626
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,540
卢娜
Luna?

627
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,470
我为她痴狂  
I'm mad for her.

628
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,160
是时候向她表白了  
I think it's about time I told her

629
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,970
我们可能都活不过今晚了
since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

630
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,500
我懂
I know.

631
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,630
我的神  这地图上怎么找到他啊
Bloody hell! We'll never find him on this.

632
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,160
他在这儿
Here he is!

633
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,790
-在这儿  -好眼力
- Just now... - Brilliant!

634
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,150
他消失了
He just vanished.

635
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,140
刚才还看到的
I just now I saw it.

636
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,490
也许他去了有求必应屋
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

637
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,030
那地方在地图上不显示的
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?

638
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,370
你去年说过
You said that last year.

639
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,670
对  我是说过
That's right, I....I did.

640
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:02,440
我们走
Let's go.

641
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,090
真厉害
Brilliant!

642
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,150
快来
Come on!

643
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,080
看啊
Well, well...

644
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,890
什么风把你吹来了  波特
What brings you here, Potter?

645
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,610
这话应该我问你
I could ask you the same.

646
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,100
你手头有我的东西
You have something of mine.

647
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,960
我想要回来
I'd like it back.

648
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,550
你手上这根魔杖有什么不好
What's wrong with the one you have?

649
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,520
它是我妈的
It's my mother's.

650
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,430
很强大  但是
It's powerful, but it's...

651
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,140
和我的不一样
...not the same.

652
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,840
不太能理解我
Doesn't quite understand me.

653
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,010
你懂我的意思吧
You know what I mean?

654
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,470
你为什么不告诉她
Why didn't you tell her?

655
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,900
贝拉特里克斯
Bellatrix?

656
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,790
你知道那就是我
You knew it was me.

657
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,250
却缄口不语
You didn't say anything.

658
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:43,930
动手吧  德拉科
Come on, Draco!

659
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,960
别犯傻
Don't be a prat.

660
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,440
动手吧
Do it!

661
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,650
别紧张
Easy!

662
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,520
除你武器
Expelliarmus.

663
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,440
阿瓦达索命
Avada Kedavra.

664
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,480
昏昏倒地
Stupefy.

665
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,980
敢打我女朋友  你们这帮混蛋
This is my girlfriend, you bloody gits!

666
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,330
拿到了
Got it!

667
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,080
高尔把这鬼地方给点着了
Goyle's set the bloody place on fire!

668
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,770
快  这边走
Come on! This way!

669
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,310
不能扔下他们
We can't leave them!

670
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,360
他开玩笑的吧
He's joking, right?

671
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,890
要是被他们拖死  我就杀了你  哈利
If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

672
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,690
哈利
Harry!

673
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,770
主人
My Lord?

674
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,260
阿达瓦索命
Avada Kedavra!

675
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:40,050
来吧  纳吉尼  我要保证你的安全
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.

676
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,750
是那条蛇
It's the snake.

677
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,170
它是最后一个
And she's the last one.

678
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,670
最后的魂器
It's the last Horcrux.

679
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,930
哈利  窥探他的内心
Look inside him, Harry.

680
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,140
寻觅他的行踪  
Find out where he is,

681
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,550
他在哪儿  蛇就在哪儿
if you find him, we can find the snake.

682
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,180
我们就能了结这一切了
And we can end this!

683
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:42,710
主人
My Lord...

684
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,940
是不是稍许
Might it be less...

685
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,030
谨慎起见还是暂停此次攻势
I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.

686
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,170
只为了找那男孩
Simply seek the boy.

687
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:56,120
就劳您亲自出马
Yourself.

688
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,370
不用我去找那男孩
I do not need to seek the boy...

689
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,680
不出今夜
before the night is out,

690
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,250
波特就会上门来找我  你明白吗
he will come to me! Do you understand?

691
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,530
看着我
Look at me!

692
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,370
卢修斯  你怎么还有脸活着
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

693
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,050
我不知道
I don't know.

694
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,600
去找西弗勒斯
Go and find Severus.

695
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,510
带他来见我
Bring him to me.

696
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,510
我知道他在哪儿
I know where he is.

697
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,070
冲啊
Come on!

698
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,150
不
No!

699
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,190
主人  就在这过去的几小时内
You have performed extra-ordinary

700
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,250
您已经用这根魔杖
magic with this wand, My Lord,

701
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,330
施展了力量非凡的魔法
in the last few hours alone.

702
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:24,990
不对
No!

703
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:33,540
非凡的是我  但魔杖在排斥我
No! I am extra-ordinary. But the wand resists me.

704
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,530
没有比它更强大的魔杖了  
There is no wand more powerful.

705
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,230
奥利凡德说过
Ollivander himself has said it.

706
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,170
若那男孩今晚来了
Tonight, when the boy comes.

707
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:45,250
这魔杖不会让你失望  我很肯定
It will not fail you, I am sure of it.

708
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:53,590
它只听从于你  别无他人
It answers to you, and you only.

709
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,420
是吗
Does it?

710
01:07:59,050 --> 01:07:59,740
主人
My Lord?

711
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,150
这魔杖真的听从于我吗
The wand, does it truly answer to me?

712
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,640
西弗勒斯  你是明白人
You're a clever man, Severus.

713
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,440
你应该知道
Surely you must know...

714
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:20,230
-魔杖真正的所属  -属于您
- ...where does its true loyalty lie? - With you.

715
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,560
毋庸置疑  主人
Of course, My Lord.

716
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:27,730
老魔杖没能顺应我
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,

717
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:30,870
因为我不是它真正的主人
because I am not its true master.

718
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,950
老魔杖属于那个杀死他前任主人的巫师
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.

719
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,610
是你杀了邓布利多
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

720
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,770
只要你活着  这魔杖就不会真正归属于我
While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.

721
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,500
西弗勒斯  你是一个好仆人  忠心耿耿  
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.

722
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:03,760
但只有我能永生不死
But only I can live forever.

723
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,190
主人
My Lord...

724
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,230
纳吉尼  杀了他
Nagini, kill!

725
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:18,940
快拿去
Take it.

726
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,450
把它收集起来  求你了
Take it up, please!

727
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,980
有容器吗  快  瓶子什么的
Give me something! Quickly, a flask. Anything!

728
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,710
放进冥想盆里
Take them to the Pensieve.

729
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:53,230
看着我
Look at me.

730
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,850
你的眼睛和你母亲的真像
You really have your mother's eyes.

731
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,330
纵然你们奋勇抗战  
You've fought valiantly,

732
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,000
也是枉然
but in vain.

733
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,640
这非我所愿
I do not wish this.

734
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:55,250
巫师的血  每流一滴都是极大的浪费
Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste.

735
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,260
因此  我下令撤军
I, therefore command my forces to retreat.

736
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,180
在此期间  
In their absence,

737
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,100
体面地安葬死者
dispose your dead with dignity.

738
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,470
哈利・波特  
Harry Potter,

739
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:12,340
现在我直接和你对话
I now speak directly to you.

740
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,490
今晚  
On this night,

741
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:18,540
你听任你的朋友为你赴死
you have allowed your friends to die for you,

742
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,760
而不是挺身出来面对我
rather than face me yourself.

743
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,930
如此行径无耻至极  
There is no greater dishonor.

744
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,770
与我在禁林里相见
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...

745
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,270
直面你的命运吧
...and confront your fate.

746
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,270
若你不来  
If you do not do this,

747
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:37,930
我会赶尽杀绝所有
I shall kill every last man,

748
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,450
胆敢窝藏你的人  
woman and child

749
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:44,540
不论男女老少
who tries to conceal you from me.

750
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,610
大家都去哪儿了
Where's everybody?

751
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,900
哈利
Harry?

752
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,820
算了  别太难过了  人死不能复生
Oh, come on! Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

753
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,120
她走了
There, she's gone.

754
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,640
怪胎  过来  
Freak! Come here!

755
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,520
我去告诉妈妈  你是个怪胎
I'm gonna tell mommy! You're freak!

756
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,580
莉莉你是个怪胎
You're freak, Lily!

757
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,840
快过来
Come here!

758
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,310
她妒忌你  她很平庸  你却不同寻常
She's jealous. She's ordinary and you're special.

759
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,640
西弗勒斯  这么说太过分了
That's mean, Severus.

760
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,950
格兰芬多
Gryffindor!

761
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,090
-你好  我是詹姆斯  -你好  我是莉莉
- Hi, I'm James. - Hi, I'm Lily.

762
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,800
和你父亲一个德性
Just like your father.

763
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,920
别说我父亲的坏话
Don't say a word against my father!

764
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,650
仆人与主人会再次相逢
Servants and masters shall be reunited once more!

765
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,050
西弗勒斯
Severus.

766
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,390
不  别杀我
No, don't kill me!

767
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,560
那预言没提到什么女人
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

768
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,780
是关于一个七月末出生的男孩
It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.

769
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,640
是的  但是他认为是她的儿子
Yes, but he thinks it's her son!

770
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,110
他想要追杀他们
He intends to hunt them down and to kill them.

771
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,930
把他们藏起来  我请求你
Hide him... hide them all. I beg you!

772
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:56,080
西弗勒斯你怎样回报我呢
What would you give me in exchange, Severus?

773
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,300
任你差遣
Anything.

774
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,220
哈利
Harry...

775
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,490
哈利我们爱你
Harry, you were so loved.

776
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,440
太爱你了  妈妈爱你
So loved! Harry, mama loves you.

777
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,860
爸爸爱你
Dadda loves you.

778
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,440
哈利  你要好好的
Harry, be safe.

779
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,540
要坚强
Be strong.

780
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,970
阿瓦达索命
Avada Kedavra!

781
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,230
你说你会保证她的安全
You said you would keep her safe.

782
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,750
莉莉和詹姆斯
Lily and James...

783
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:30,460
错信了他人  西弗勒斯
..put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

784
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,090
不像你
Rather like you.

785
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,720
那孩子活下来了
The boy survives.

786
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:38,920
他不需要保护  黑魔王不复存在了
He doesn't need protection, the Dark Lord has gone.

787
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,740
黑魔王会回来的
The Dark Lord will return.

788
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,590
到那时候  那男孩会有生命危险
And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger!

789
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,860
他眼睛和他母亲的很像
He has her eyes.

790
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,860
如果你真的爱她
If you truly loved her...

791
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:02,340
别告诉任何人
No one, can know.

792
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,000
我绝不会美化你  西弗勒斯
I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus.

793
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,210
你保证
Your word?

794
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,930
你能冒性命之危  时刻保护那孩子吗
Can you risk your life every day to protect the boy?

795
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,090
这孩子资质平庸
He possesses no measurable talent,

796
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:13,360
他的傲慢甚至和他父亲不相上下  
his arrogance rivals even that of his father

797
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,870
似乎还挺享受自己的名声
and he seems to relish in his fame.

798
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,270
不许说我父亲的坏话
Don't say a word against my father!

799
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:22,060
詹姆斯・波特  懒惰  傲慢
James Potter, lazy, arrogant.

800
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,440
-我父亲很了不起  -你父亲是头蠢猪
- My father was a great man! - Your father was a swine!

801
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:30,100
喝了它  这会把魔咒
Drink it up, it will contain

802
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,950
暂时遏制在一只手里
the curse to your hand, for the time being.

803
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:36,220
-它会扩散  阿不思  -我还能活多久
- It will spread, Albus. - How long?

804
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,610
大概一年
Maybe a year.

805
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,970
不要逃避  西弗勒斯
Don't ignore me, Severus.

806
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,370
我们都了解  伏地魔
We both know Lord Voldemort

807
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,660
下令让马尔福家的那个男孩杀死我
has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

808
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:58,000
但如果他失败了  我想黑魔王会让你接替
But should he fail, I should presume the Dark Lord will turn to you.

809
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:04,090
必须由你来杀死我  西弗勒斯
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

810
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,040
这是唯一的办法
It is the only way.

811
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:12,770
只有这样  黑魔王才会完全信任你
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

812
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,570
会有那么一天
It will come a time,

813
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,970
你必须告诉哈利・波特一些事情
when Harry Potter, must be told something.

814
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,600
但你必须等到伏地魔最虚弱的时候
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

815
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,780
必须告诉他什么
Must be told what?

816
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:38,270
伏地魔去戈德里克山谷杀哈利的那晚  
On the night, Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry,

817
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,890
莉莉・波特用生命挡在他们之间
and Lily Potter cast herself between them.

818
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,780
咒语反弹了
The curse rebounded.

819
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,960
那时  伏地魔灵魂的一部分  
When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul

820
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,580
附着在周围唯一的活物上
latched itself onto the only living thing it could find.

821
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,870
就是哈利他自己
Harry himself.

822
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:02,690
所以哈利有了与蛇对话的能力
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes.

823
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,060
还能窥探伏地魔的思想
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind.

824
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:15,380
伏地魔灵魂的一部分依附在他体内
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

825
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:27,460
所以  待到时机成熟  那男孩必须赴死吗
So, when the time comes, the boy must die?

826
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:33,330
是的...是的  他必须赴死
Yes... yes. He must die.

827
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:56,140
你让他活着  只是让他到时候去赴死
You've kept him alive, so he can die at the proper moment?

828
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,520
就像养一头猪  最后宰了
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

829
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,800
不要告诉我  你开始关心起那个男孩了
Don't tell me now, that you've grown to care for the boy.

830
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,850
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum.

831
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,720
莉莉的守护神
Lily!

832
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,780
时隔多年依旧如此?
After all this time?

833
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,540
一直如此
Always.

834
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,530
所以  待到时机成熟
So, when the time comes,

835
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,790
那男孩必须赴死
the boy must die?

836
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:52,770
是的
Yes.

837
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,710
他必须赴死  而且必须由伏地魔亲自动手
He must die. And Voldemort himself must do it.

838
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,310
必须如此
That is essential.

839
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,720
-你去哪儿了  -我还以为你去了禁林
- Where've you been? - I thought you went to the forest.

840
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,960
我现在要去那儿
I'm going there now.

841
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,360
你疯了吗  不行...
Are you mad? No...

842
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,910
你不能把自己交出去
You can't give yourself up to him.

843
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,350
怎么了  哈利
What is it, Harry?

844
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:24,800
你知道什么了
What is it you know?

845
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,210
我能听到它们  是有原因的
There's a reason I can hear them.

846
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:32,810
魂器
The Horcruxes.

847
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,010
我想我早就知道原因了
I think I've known for a while.

848
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,700
我想你也是
And I think you have, too.

849
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,030
-我和你一起去  -不  把蛇杀死
- I'll go with you. - No, kill the snake.

850
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,230
把蛇杀死  就只剩下伏地魔自己了
Kill the snake, and then it's just him!

851
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:08,440
我在结束时打开

852
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,130
我准备好赴死了
I'm ready to die.

853
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,820
复活石
Resurrection Stone.

854
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,990
你真勇敢  宝贝
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

855
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:36,810
你们怎么都来了
Why are you here? All of you.

856
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,360
我们从未离开过
We never left.

857
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:54,740
疼吗
Does... Does it hurt?

858
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,230
死亡
Dying?

859
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,430
比进入梦乡还要快
Quicker than falling asleep.

860
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,150
你就要成功了  儿子
You're nearly there, son.

861
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:08,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

862
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,420
我从未想过让你们为我死去
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

863
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,520
还有  莱姆斯  你的儿子
And, Remus, your son?

864
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,580
其他人会告诉他  他父母是为何而死的
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for.

865
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,640
总有一天  他会明白的
One day, he'll understand.

866
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,370
你们会陪着我吗
You'll stay with me?

867
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,200
直到最后
Until the end.

868
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,970
他看不见你们吗
And he won't be able to see you?

869
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,520
看不见
No.

870
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,230
我们在你心里
We're here, you see.

871
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,080
待在我身边
Stay close to me.

872
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,030
永远都在
Always.

873
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,180
没有他的影子  主人
No sign of him, My Lord.

874
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,170
我原以为他会来
I thought he would come.

875
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,080
哈利  不
Harry, no!

876
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:31,770
-你到这儿来干什么  -闭嘴
- What're yeh doin' here? - Quiet!

877
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,530
哈利・波特...
Harry Potter...

878
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,290
大难不死的男孩...
The Boy Who Lived...

879
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,090
来受死了
come to die.

880
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,690
阿瓦达索命
Avada Kedavra.

881
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,460
你帮不了
You can't help.

882
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:20,140
哈利  你这个出色的孩子
Harry, you wonderful boy.

883
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,080
勇敢的男子汉
You brave, brave man!

884
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,420
一起走走吧
Let us walk.

885
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,060
教授  那是什么
Professor, what is that?

886
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,910
是我们都无能为力的一种东西
Something beyond either of our help.

887
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:50,010
伏地魔死去的一部分灵魂
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

888
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,520
我们究竟是在哪儿呢
And exactly where are we?

889
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,270
我正打算问你呢
I was going to ask you that.

890
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,280
你说我们是在哪儿
Where would you say that we are?

891
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:01,310
看起来像是国王十字车站
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.

892
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,220
只是要干净许多
Only cleaner,

893
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:06,360
而且没有火车
and without all the trains.

894
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:09,750
国王十字车站  真的吗
King's Cross, is that right?

895
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,870
就像人们说的  这的确是你的地盘
This is, as they say, "your" party.

896
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,200
我想你现在已经知道你和伏地魔
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort

897
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,300
不仅是因为命运安排而联系在一起
have been connected by something other than fate.

898
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,720
更因为多年前那晚  在戈德里克山谷发生的事
Since that night in Godric's Hollow, all those years ago.

899
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,500
看来是真的了  先生
So it's true then, sir.

900
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:29,140
伏地魔灵魂的一部分附在我身上  是吗
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

901
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,190
附过
Did.

902
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:32,670
就在刚才  
It's been just destroyed

903
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:35,550
它被伏地魔自己给摧毁了
many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

904
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,230
你是他无意间制造的魂器  哈利
You, were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry.

905
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,230
-我必须回去  是吗  -这由你决定
- I have to go back, haven't I? - Oh, that's up to you.

906
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:01,300
-我可以选择吗  -是的
- I've a choice? - Oh, yes!

907
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,160
你说我们在国王十字车站
We're in King's Cross, you say.

908
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,020
只要你想好了  
I think if you so decide,

909
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,750
就可以登上一列火车
you'll be able to board a train.

910
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:14,360
它会把我带到哪儿呢
And where would it take me?

911
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,330
前方
On.

912
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,690
伏地魔有老魔杖
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

913
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:40,980
没错
True.

914
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,370
蛇还活着?
And the snake's still alive?

915
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,550
是的
Yes.

916
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,880
我拿什么杀他
And I've nothing to kill it with?

917
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,450
在霍格沃茨  那些请求帮助的人
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,

918
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,160
总会如愿  哈利
Harry. To those who ask for it.

919
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:56,660
我一直为自己出口成章的能力而自豪
I've always pride of myself on my ability to turn a phrase.

920
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,180
不谦虚的说  我认为语言
Words are, in my not so humble opinion,

921
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:04,030
是最取之不尽的魔力源泉
are most inexhaustible source of magic.

922
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,610
能治愈伤害  抚平伤痕
Capable of inflicting injury and remedies.

923
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:14,990
但这次  我要收回原来的话
But I would in this case, amend my original statement to this:

924
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:22,190
在霍格沃茨  那些值得帮助的人  
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,

925
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,880
总能如愿
to those who deserve it.

926
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:32,350
不要怜悯死者  哈利
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

927
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,990
怜悯生者
Pity the living.

928
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:40,270
尤其  要怜悯那些心中无爱的人
And above all, all those who live without love.

929
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,160
教授  我妈妈的守护神
Professor, my mother's Patronus,

930
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,310
是一只牝鹿  是吗
was a doe, wasn't it?

931
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,600
和斯内普教授的一样
As the same as Professor Snape's.

932
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:54,490
您不觉得这很奇妙吗
It's curious, don't you think?

933
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:58,420
实际上  在我看来  这一点也不奇妙
Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all!

934
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,450
我要先走了  哈利
I'll be going now, Harry.

935
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,800
教授
Professor?

936
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,050
这一切是真实的吗
Is this all real?

937
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:14,430
或者只是发生在我脑中的事
Or is it just happening inside my head?

938
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,010
当然是发生在你脑子里的事  哈利
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.

939
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:21,120
但那为什么不能是真实的呢
Why should that mean, that it's not real?

940
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:28,800
教授
Professor?

941
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:30,440
我该怎么做
What should I do?

942
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,070
教授
Professor!

943
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,240
主人  主人...
My Lord, My Lord...

944
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:43,280
您受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

945
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:45,530
我不需要帮助
I don't need your help.

946
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,690
那个男孩...他死了吗
The boy... Is he dead?

947
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,170
他还活着吗
Is he alive?

948
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:18,860
德拉科还活着吗
Draco, is he alive?

949
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:47,050
他死了
Dead.

950
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,600
那是谁
Who is that?

951
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,350
海格抱着的是谁
Hagrid's carrying?

952
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,430
纳威  那是谁
Neville, who is it?

953
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:25,520
哈利・波特...死了 
Harry Potter... is dead!

954
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:26,550
不
No!

955
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:27,500
不
No!

956
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,350
安静
Silence!

957
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,550
蠢女孩
Stupid girl!

958
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,920
哈利・波特...死了
Harry Potter... is dead!

959
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:46,260
从今天起  你们要效忠于我
From this day forth... you'll put your faith in me.

960
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,580
哈利・波特死了
Harry Potter is dead!

961
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:06,230
是宣誓效忠的时候了
And now it's the time to declare yourself.

962
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,640
要么站出来加入我们  
Come forward and join us,

963
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,770
要么受死
or die!

964
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:22,020
德拉科
Draco!

965
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:28,380
德拉科
Draco.

966
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:33,260
德拉科
Draco.

967
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:37,750
过来
Come.

968
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,220
干的好  德拉科
Well done, Draco.

969
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,160
干的好
Well done!

970
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,920
我还以为能站出来个像样的
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.

971
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,730
你是谁  年轻人
And who might you be, young man?

972
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,080
纳威・隆巴顿
Neville Longbottom.

973
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:40,880
纳威  我们定能给你腾出个地方
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our rank.

974
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:42,380
我有话要说
I'd like to say something.

975
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,160
好吧  纳威
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd

976
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:53,990
不妨说来听听
all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.

977
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,440
-哈利死去了也没关系  -回来  纳威
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone. - Stand down, Neville!

978
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:02,060
每天都有人死去
People die everyday!

979
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,290
朋友  家人
Friends, family.

980
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:11,870
是的
Yeah.

981
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:15,480
我们今晚失去了哈利
We lost Harry tonight.

982
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:18,970
但他仍然与我们同在
He's still with us.

983
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,320
在我们心里
In here.

984
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:29,960
就像弗雷德  莱姆斯  唐克斯一样...
So as Fred, Remus, Tonks...

985
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,420
所有逝者
All of them.

986
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:36,870
他们没有白白死去
They didn't die in vain.

987
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,330
但你们会
But you will.

988
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,910
因为你们错了
Because you're wrong!

989
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,450
哈利的心还在为我们而跳动
Harry's heart did beat for us.

990
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,120
为我们所有的人
For all of us!

991
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,660
还没结束呢
It's not over!

992
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,020
霹雳爆炸
Confringo.

993
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:09,070
快跑
Come on!

994
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,430
所有人都待在城堡里
All remain into the castle.

995
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,800
我们必须杀掉那条蛇
We have to kill the snake.

996
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,490
纳威
Neville!

997
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:19,170
不许碰我女儿  你这母狗
Not my daughter, you bitch!

998
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,050
你是对的
Hey, you were right,

999
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,290
当你告诉斯内普教授老魔杖不听你指挥时
when you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you.

1000
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,150
它永远不会听命于你
It will always fail.

1001
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,140
我杀了斯内普
I killed Snape!

1002
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:04,570
但如果老魔杖从未听命于斯内普呢
But what if the wand never belonged to Snape?

1003
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:07,230
如果它一直效忠于其他人呢
What if its allegiance is always to someone else?

1004
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,270
来吧  汤姆
Oh, come on, Tom...

1005
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,210
我们怎么开始  就怎么结束吧
Let's finish this the way we started.

1006
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,420
一起
Together!

1007
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:14,030
去死吧
Die!

1008
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,510
哈利
Harry!

1009
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:02,250
为什么它不听命于伏地魔
Why didn't it work for him?

1010
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:03,830
老魔杖
The Elder Wand?

1011
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,340
它听命于其他人
It answered to somebody else.

1012
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:09,790
他杀了斯内普后  
When he killed Snape,

1013
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:11,260
就以为老魔杖真正属于他了
he thought the wand would become his.

1014
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,050
但事实是...
But the thing is...

1015
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:15,970
老魔杖从未属于过斯内普
The wand never belonged to Snape.

1016
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,530
它属于德拉科  那晚
It was Draco, who disarmed

1017
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,370
他在天文塔除去了邓布利多手中的魔杖
Dumbledore that night in the Astronomy tower.

1018
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:23,660
从那时开始  魔杖就效忠于他了
From that moment on and the wand answered him.

1019
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:29,690
直到那晚我夺去了德拉科的魔杖
Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.

1020
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,440
在马尔福庄园
At Malfoy Manor.

1021
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:33,290
所以  那就意味着...
So, that means...

1022
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:36,610
它属于我了
It's mine!

1023
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:42,200
-我们应该用它来做些什么  -我们
- What should we do with it? - We?

1024
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:44,990
只是说说而已  这可是老魔杖
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.

1025
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:47,510
世界上最强大的魔杖
The most powerful wand in the world.

1026
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:50,940
有了它  哈利可以战无不胜了
With that, he'd be invincible.

1027
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:24,410
十九年后

1028
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:15,670
一起吧
Together.

1029
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,570
-包背好了?  -好了
- Bag? - Yeah.

1030
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,140
套头衫呢
Jumper?

1031
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,930
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

1032
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,180
他们来了
Here they come.

1033
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:20,670
爸爸
Dad?

1034
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,350
如果我被分进了斯莱特林怎么办
What if I am put in Slytherin?

1035
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,940
阿不思・西弗勒斯・波特
Albus Severus Potter.

1036
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,950
你是以霍格沃茨两位校长的名字命名的
You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.

1037
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,970
其中一位就是斯莱特林的
One of them was a Slytherin.

1038
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:38,860
他是我见过的最勇敢的人
And he was the bravest man I've ever known.

1039
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:42,920
可是如果...  
But just say if I am...

1040
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,310
那斯莱特林学院就会多出一位
Then Slytherin house will have gained

1041
01:56:45,310 --> 01:56:47,260
出色的年轻巫师
a wonderful young wizard.

1042
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,150
但是听着  如果你真的很在意的话  
But listen, if it really means that much to you,

1043
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:53,380
你可以选择格兰芬多
you can choose Gryffindor.

1044
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:56,580
分院帽会考虑你的选择
The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.

1045
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:59,810
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Really.

1046
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,720
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Ready.

1047
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:03,690
人人影视电影翻译小组
谨以此片献给所有观众

1048
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:11,350
Farewell!  Harry Potter!
