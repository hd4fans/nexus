00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,230
大卫·里恩

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,130
桂河大桥

6
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,930
快点干完活！
Finish work!

7
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,390
到棚屋去
Go to hut.

8
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,140
是啊 要不让新来的俘虏
Yeah, that figures.

9
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,150
看到我们在挖坟墓 他们会要逃跑的
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.

10
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,440
没时间说笑了 快点干
No time for jokes. Finish work!

11
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,650
挖 挖
Dig, dig.

12
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,450
把我们算作病号 怎么样
How about putting us on sick list?

13
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,780
发发慈悲吧 上尉 把我们放到医院里吧
Have a heart, captain. Put us in hospital.

14
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,330
你现在没有病 你从来没有病
You no sick. You never sick.

15
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,040
你为什么一直要装病 舍尔斯
Why you always play sick, Shears?

16
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,170
我猜我不想放个这玩意儿在我头顶上
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.

17
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,710
金松上尉…
Captain Kanematsu...

18
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,630
…烟屁股怎么样？
...how about a butt?

19
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,550
我今早才给你的 给你们俩
I give you butt this morning. Both of you.

20
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,010
是的 我不是那意思 我想回报一下
That's what I mean. I want to return the favour.

21
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,020
当一个好心人给我礼物…
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart...

22
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,150
…就像你给我那烟屁股 我会牢记在心的
...like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.

23
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,270
这就是为什么…
That's why...

24
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,400
…我想给你这打火机
...l want you to keep this lighter.

25
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,240
以为是我偷的
Think I stole it?

26
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,160
这是我们刚刚埋的那个英国小伙子的
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.

27
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,120
是他感激我而送给我的
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.

28
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,330
在我死前 我想把它送给你
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.

29
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,130
你这个人真有趣 舍尔斯
You funny man, Shears.

30
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,970
你现在是病号了 他也是
You go on sick list. Him too.

31
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,970
总有一天 Saito 上校会发现你在贿赂他…
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him...

32
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,850
…那时我们会怎么样
...then where'll we be?

33
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,850
在那之前 我们早就离开这里了 伙计
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.

34
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,150
逃得远远的
Far away.

35
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
好吧 我们收工吧
Okay, let's knock off.

36
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,610
这里躺着…
Here lies....

37
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,200
我忘掉了我们刚才埋的是谁
I forgot who we just buried.

38
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,700
汤姆森
Thomson.

39
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,290
啊 对
Ah, yes.

40
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,500
这里躺着赫伯特 汤姆森下士…
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

41
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,540
…编号是:01234567
...serial number zero- one- two-  three- four- five- six- seven.

42
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,760
国王或女王或着什么的勇敢的战士…
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something...

43
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,550
…在我主纪元1943 死于脚气病…
...who died of beri- beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943...

44
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,260
…为了光荣伟大的…
...for the greater glory of....

45
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,640
- 他是为了什么死的  - 算了
- What did he die for? - Come off it.

46
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,100
不要嘲笑死人
No need to mock the grave.

47
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,440
我没有嘲笑死人
I don't mock the grave or the man.

48
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,570
希望他能在和平中安息
May he rest in peace.

49
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,110
虽然在他活着的时候没有找到和平
He found little of it while he was alive.

50
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,360
A 队 原地踏步走！
"A" Company, mark time!

51
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,210
原地踏步走！
Mark time!

52
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,620
立定
Halt.

53
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,830
排成一行 向左转
Into line, left turn.

54
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,090
稍息
Stand easy.

55
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,300
我们又要挖很多墓 维佛
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.

56
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,810
干的好 干的好
Well done, well done.

57
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,940
那个上校还不知道他将会遭遇到什么
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.

58
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,200
你准备去告诉他真相？
You going to tell him the truth?

59
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,700
当然不
Of course not.

60
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,740
你既不是军官也不是个绅士
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.

61
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,900
我叫 尼科尔森
My name is Nicholson.

62
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,110
我是Saito 上校
I am Colonel Saito.

63
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,800
我以天皇的名义…
In the name of His lmperial Majesty...

64
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,880
…欢迎你们
...l welcome you.

65
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,050
我是这个战俘营的指挥官…
I am the commanding officer of this camp...

66
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,310
…这里是沿着这条大铁路…
...which is Camp 1 6...

67
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,890
…的第16战俘营…
...along the great railroad...

68
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,310
…这条铁路很快就将曼谷和仰光连接起来
...which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.

69
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,780
你们这些英军俘虏…
You British prisoners have been chosen...

70
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,200
…将要去修建一座跨越桂河的大桥
...to build a bridge across the River Kwai.

71
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,410
这将是一个愉快的工作 但需要技能
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.

72
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,500
军官也要和士兵一起工作
And officers will work as well as men.

73
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,090
我们小日本军队不会养吃白饭的懒人
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.

74
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,300
如果你努力工作 就会得到优待
If you work hard, you will be treated well.

75
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,100
但是如果你不努力工作…
But if you do not work hard...

76
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,890
…你将受到惩罚
...you will be punished.

77
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,810
关于逃跑 我要说几句
A word to you about escape.

78
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,150
这里没有铁丝网
There is no barbed wire.

79
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,440
没有围栏
No stockade.

80
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,450
也没有了望哨
No watchtower.

81
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,120
这些都不需要
They are not necessary.

82
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,990
我们处于热带雨林中一个孤岛
We are an island in the jungle.

83
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,210
逃出去是不可能的
Escape is impossible.

84
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,250
会死在雨林中的
You would die.

85
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,880
今天休息 明天开始干活
Today you rest. Tomorrow you'll begin.

86
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,220
最后让我告诉你们山下将军的格言:
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:

87
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,260
"在工作中寻求快乐"
" Be happy in your work."

88
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,930
在工作中寻求快乐
Be happy in your work.

89
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,940
解散
Dismissed.

90
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,150
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

91
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,820
出队 休斯上校
Fall out, Major Hughes.

92
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,200
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand easy.

93
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,540
休斯 把他们带到岗位上去 看看谁生病了
Hughes, get the men to their quarters. See who's sick.

94
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,120
我要和这家伙说句话
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.

95
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,380
我刚才听了你的训话 先生
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

96
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,340
我的部下会坚持英国士兵的一贯方式
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.

97
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,930
我的军官和我会对他们的行为负责
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.

98
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,270
你可能没注意到让军官去劳动…
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour...

99
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,940
…在日内瓦公约中是不允许的
...is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.

100
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,400
是那样的吗
Is that so?

101
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,320
我有一份公约的复印件…
I have a copy of the convention...

102
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,530
…我很乐意让你看一下
...and would be glad to let you glance through it.

103
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,160
不用了
That will not be necessary.

104
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,450
请坐
Sit down, please.

105
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,500
是 长官
Yes, sir.

106
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,920
我要和科林普顿说句话
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

107
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,510
科林普顿 不要让别人打扰我
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

108
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,550
- 胳膊怎么样了  - 快好了
- How's the arm? - Nearly healed.

109
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,270
先生 这是美国海军的舍尔斯司令官
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.

110
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,730
你好 先生
How do you do, sir?

111
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,640
我们发现他和一个澳大利亚人
We found him and an Australian.

112
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,940
是修建这个营地的仅存俘虏
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.

113
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,860
美国海军  大老远的跑到这里
U.S. Navy? Out here?

114
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,110
我们差不多被陆地包围了
I am sort of landlocked.

115
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,530
- 然后你丢弃了你的船  - 休斯顿号
- You lost your ship? - The Houston.

116
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,200
我让它搁浅 但是我和其他的幸存者失散了
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.

117
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,870
这儿原来和你在一起的人呢
And your group here?

118
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,330
多数是澳洲人 一些…
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

119
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,830
英国人还有印度人 缅甸人 暹罗人
Some British. Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

120
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,710
他们怎么了？
And what happened to them?

121
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
他们都死于…
They died...

122
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,800
…疟疾 痢疾 脚气和坏疽
...of malaria, dysentery, beri- beri, gangrene.

123
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,300
其他的死因是:
Other causes of death:

124
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,640
饥饿 劳累过度 枪伤 蛇咬…
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites...

125
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,600
…还有 Saito
...Saito.

126
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,140
然后还有一些不想过了
Then there were some who just got tired of living.

127
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,640
科林普顿给你检查过了吗
Has Clipton seen you?

128
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,020
正好就要看了 过来 你可以待会刮脸
Just about to. Come over here, you can shave later.

129
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,440
好的
All right.

130
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,950
你可以和军官待在一起
You'll stay with the officers.

131
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,860
我们会给你找一些象样的衣服
We'll find some decent clothing.

132
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,530
不要为我操心了
Don't bother about me.

133
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,990
我还不想急着离开病号房
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.

134
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,080
另外 这是劳动工具 这儿流行这个
Besides, this is working kit. It's the fashion here.

135
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,460
你们当时连军官都干体力劳动吗？
The officers in your party did manual labour?

136
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,380
我想是的
I think you could call it that.

137
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
我可以列举出那个上校让我们做的每一点 他叫什么来着
I raised that very point with Colonel what's- his- name.

138
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,300
斋藤
Saito.

139
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,430
- 我认为他现在明白那样做是不对的了 - 是吗？
- I think he understands now. - Is that so?

140
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,970
是的 我必须说明 他看起来好像是那种很通情达理的类型
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.

141
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,100
是这样啊 那我可得抓紧了
Well, I must be pushing on.

142
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,140
7点钟有个军官会议
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

143
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,270
- 把你的要求列个单子 - 是 长官
- Give me a list of your requirements. - Yes, sir.

144
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,270
我们会尽量满足
Anything we can do.

145
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,190
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

146
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,860
- 这是为什么  - 别介意
- What is it? - Never mind.

147
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,490
说说看
Go on, say it.

148
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,870
我可以想象出很多称呼Saito的词
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito...

149
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,580
…"通情达理" 倒是第一次听说
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

150
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,920
或许尼科尔森上校对这个词有不同的定义
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.

151
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,180
有其他补充的吗
Any other points?

152
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
- 可以允许我说吗 长官  - 詹宁斯
- By your leave, sir? - Jennings?

153
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,180
有关逃跑委员会 我已经和舍尔斯司令官讨论过了…
About the escape committee. I've spoken with Cmd. Shears...

154
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,270
不会再有什么逃跑委员会了
There won't be any escape committee.

155
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,060
我不明白 长官 詹宁斯少尉有个计划
I don't understand, sir. Lt. Jennings has a plan.

156
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,100
是的 是的 我相信詹宁斯有个计划 但是 逃到哪里？
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?

157
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,780
逃进雨林  那个Saito家伙说的是对的
Where? lnto this jungle? That fellow, Saito, is right.

158
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,030
这里是不需要铁丝网 逃进雨林只有1/100的生存可能
No need for barbed wire here. One chance in 1 00 of survival.

159
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,410
我认为象舍尔斯司令官 那样有经验的人会支持我的计划
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.

160
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,410
我说过了逃跑成功的可能性是1/100
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.

161
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,460
我可以插个嘴吗？
But may I add another word?

162
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,960
请
Please.

163
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,340
在这个战俘营的生存概率还要小
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.

164
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,590
你已经看到了那些坟墓 他们是你在这里生存的真实几率
You've seen the graveyard. They're your real odds.

165
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,050
放弃逃走的希望…
To give up hope of escape...

166
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,640
…甚至不去考虑逃走 意味着接受死亡宣判
...to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.

167
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,560
为什么到目前你还没有试着逃跑呢 司令官先生
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?

168
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,690
我在等候良机 等待正确的时间 和正确的伙伴
I'm biding my time. Waiting for the right moment, the right company.

169
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,980
我知道你的感受
I understand how you feel.

170
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,110
当然 作为一个被俘士兵 逃跑是他的天职
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.

171
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,240
但是我和我的部下正处在一个奇怪的境地…
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point...

172
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,660
而你并不知道这个
...of which you are unaware.

173
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,580
在新加坡 是指挥部命令我们投降的
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.

174
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,500
请注意 是命令
Ordered, mind you.

175
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,250
所以 在我们这种情况下 逃跑就会违反战争法
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.

176
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,750
这真有意思 长官
Interesting point, sir.

177
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,550
对不起 长官 我不能同意你的观点
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.

178
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,380
你想不惜一切代价去遵守法律条文
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?

179
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,300
没有了法律 指挥官先生 就不会有文明的存在
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.

180
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,930
这正是我的观点 在这里 没有文明
That's just my point. Here, there is no civilization.

181
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,980
那么 我们正好有机会在这里引进文明
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.

182
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,310
我建议否决逃跑的议题
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.

183
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,070
还有什么要说的吗？
Is there anything else?

184
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
我想我们都清楚了
I think we're clear on the program.

185
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,740
我想从明天开始所有的事情都能顺利展开
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.

186
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,540
并且 请各位记住:
And remember this:

187
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,830
必须要让我们的人感觉是我们在指挥他们…
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us...

188
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,040
…而不是小日本
...and not by the Japanese.

189
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,550
这样 他们就会还是士兵 而不是奴隶
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

190
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
同意我的观点吗 指挥官先生？
Are you with me there, commander?

191
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,510
我希望他们还能是士兵 上校
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.

192
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,890
可我只是个奴隶
As for me, I'm just a slave.

193
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,230
一个还活着的奴隶
A living slave.

194
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,740
即使在美国人来说 他也是个古怪的家伙…
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

195
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,000
被囚禁得太久了 可怜的家伙
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.

196
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,330
这就是脱离自己人的结果 对我们也是个教训
Cut off from his unit. It should be a lesson to all of us.

197
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,770
英军俘虏们！
English prisoners!

198
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,610
请注意我不是说"英军士兵"
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

199
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,700
当你们投降的那一刻起 你们就不是士兵了
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.

200
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,700
你们要在五月12号前完成大桥
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.

201
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,210
你们会在小日本工程师的指导下工作
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.

202
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,670
时间很短 所有人都得工作
Time is short. All men will work.

203
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,970
你们的军官会和你们一起工作
Your officers will work beside you.

204
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,970
投降就是你们的军官对你们的背叛
This is only just...

205
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,230
这就是对他们背叛你们的处罚
...for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.

206
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,020
羞辱你们就是要让羞辱他们
Your shame is their dishonour.

207
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,770
是他们告诉你们…
It is they who told you...

208
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,610
…好死不如赖活着
...better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.

209
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,110
是他们让你们来这里的 不是我
It is they who brought you here, not l.

210
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,830
所以 他们也要和你们一起干体力活
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.

211
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,120
完毕
That is all.

212
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,420
军官俘虏们 拿好你们的工具
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

213
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,210
布拉德利 归队
Bradley, back in your place.

214
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,180
我必须让你注意 Saito上校…
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito...

215
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,100
…在日内瓦公约的27条
...to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.

216
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,480
" 交战国可以雇用战俘去做他们合适做的工作…
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war...

217
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,770
…指挥官除外… "
...who are fit, other than officers..."

218
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,270
把书给我
Give me the book.

219
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,070
当然你能读懂英文吗？我有点怀疑
By all means. You read English, I take it?

220
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,450
- 你能读懂日文吗  - 很遗憾 不会
- Do you read Japanese? - I'm sorry, no.

221
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,950
如果需要翻译 我想我可以安排
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.

222
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
你看 规则(Code)指出…
You see, the Code states that...

223
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,410
站着别动
Stand fast in the ranks.

224
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,500
你和我说"规则"
You speak to me of Code?

225
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,250
你说的是什么"规则"
What " Code"?

226
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,670
你说的是懦夫的"规则"！
The coward's code!

227
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,430
你知道什么是士兵的规则
What do you know of the soldier's code?

228
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,850
你知道什么是武士道的规则  你什么都不知道
Of bushido? Nothing!

229
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,560
你不配当指挥官！
You are unworthy of command!

230
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,530
如果你拒绝遵守文明世界的法规…
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world...

231
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,410
…那我们要考虑是否有义务去听从你的命令
...we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.

232
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,910
我的军官不会去做体力劳动
My officers will not do manual labour.

233
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,870
我们走着瞧
We shall see.

234
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
所有战俘开始去工作
All enlisted prisoners to work.

235
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,640
军士长！ 带他们去工作
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

236
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,610
全体注意 拿起工具
Battalion, take up tools.

237
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,700
向左靠齐 向左转！
Move to the left in columnar route. Left turn!

238
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,700
"A" 队 齐步走
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.

239
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,370
向右看
Eyes right.

240
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,380
向右看
Eyes right.

241
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,970
向前看
Eyes front.

242
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,060
齐步走 向右看
Quick march, eyes right.

243
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,040
" C" 队
" C" Company, by the right.

244
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,080
他在等什么
What's he up to?

245
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,540
好像他不想有人看到
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.

246
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,440
现在 你是否会明白一些
Now, you will be reasonable.

247
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,900
命令你的指挥官去开始工作
You will order your officers to work.

248
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,400
不
No.

249
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
我数三下
I will count three.

250
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,890
如果数到第三下…
If by the third count...

251
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,570
…你和你的指挥官还没有去工作的话…
...you and your officers are not on the way to work...

252
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,490
…我就下令开枪
...l will give the order to fire.

253
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,160
他会这样做的
He's going to do it.

254
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,210
相信我 他确实想杀了他们
Believe me, he's really going to do it.

255
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,800
一
One.

256
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,600
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, Colonel....

257
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,310
二
Two.

258
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,730
等一等！
Stop!

259
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,610
Saito上校 我耳闻目睹了一切
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.

260
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,740
医院里的人也这样
So has every man in the hospital.

261
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,360
有太多的证人
They're too many witnesses.

262
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,620
你不能谎称这是集体逃跑 那些人很多连路都不能走
You can't call it a mass escape. Most of those men can't walk.

263
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,960
这就是你的士兵规则  屠杀手无寸铁的人
Is this your soldier's code? Murdering unarmed men?

264
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,120
詹宁斯 你看 当个病号多好
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.

265
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,290
我认为那老家伙勇气十足
I'll say this for the old man. He's got guts.

266
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,790
这样会死得更快
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."

267
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,420
怎么会那样 长官？
How's that, sir?

268
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,630
那种愚蠢的勇气
That kind of guts.

269
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,630
就像他们在1914一样…
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4...

270
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,550
…那时 军官们用拐杖来反抗
...when officers fought with only a swagger stick.

271
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,050
- 我明白你的意思 - 你一点也不明白我的意思
- I see what you mean. - You don't see what I mean at all.

272
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,180
那种勇气会让我们全部送命的
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.

273
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,600
对不起 长官 我也要和你一起逃跑
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.

274
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,770
我的胳膊差不多好了 长官 情况确实象你说的那样
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.

275
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,060
那他会同意吗
What about him?

276
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,730
他并没有命令我们不准逃跑 他只是建议我们不逃跑
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.

277
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,820
听着 象你们上校那样人的建议就是命令
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.

278
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,490
又开始了
Here we go again.

279
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,090
Saito上校命令所有军官去惩戒室
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.

280
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,170
告诉他们去惩戒室
Tell them to go.

281
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,890
你留下
Not you.

282
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,070
过来
Come.

283
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,890
放了他！
Leave him alone!

284
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,390
放了他！
Leave him alone!

285
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,320
他们要把他关进闷室
They're going to put him in the oven.

286
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,390
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,140
# For he's a jolly good fellow

288
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,650
# And so say all of us

289
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,690
# And so say all of us And so say all of us

290
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,030
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

291
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,700
# For he's a jolly good fellow

292
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,330
# And so say all of us

293
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,790
倒啦！
Timber!

294
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,970
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

295
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,220
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

296
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,850
不行！
No, no, no!

297
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,810
松开！
Let go!

298
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,690
松开！
Let go!

299
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,410
你想来见我
You wish to see me?

300
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,870
3天来 我一直想见你
I've tried to see you for three days.

301
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,210
上校已经被关在闷室里…
It's about the colonel. He's been shut up in that hut...

302
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,380
我应该枪毙你
I could have you shot.

303
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,260
那些想逃跑的俘虏是你的手下
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.

304
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,340
对逃跑我毫不知情
I knew nothing about the escape.

305
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,180
那无关紧要
It does not matter.

306
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,310
那些逃跑的人值得尊敬
One must respect those who tried.

307
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,310
在逃亡和死亡的一瞬间…
For a brief moment, between escape and death...

308
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,270
他们又成了战士
...they were soldiers again.

309
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,400
但是试图从这里逃出去是愚蠢的
But it is insane to try and escape.

310
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,950
两个被枪打死 第三个被淹死
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.

311
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,660
到头来又有什么好结果呢？
To what end?

312
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,740
只不过是逃避现实罢了
It was an escape from reality.

313
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,750
这是你的现实
There is your reality.

314
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,760
按计划 你们今天中午应该修到这里了
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.

315
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,850
而实际上只到这里
And this shows the position of actual progress.

316
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,730
由于你们上校的愚顽不化 我们的进度远远落后了
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.

317
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
还不止这些
That is not all.

318
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,570
战俘还蓄意破坏
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

319
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,740
是的 我看到的 我早就应该枪毙他们
Yes, I have seen it. I could have them all shot.

320
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,620
然后 谁替你造桥呢？
Then who would build your bridge?

321
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,830
另外 你认为那真的是蓄意破坏吗？
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

322
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,120
没有了自己的指挥官 他们的工作肯定不会做得太好
The men don't work well without their own officers.

323
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:39,170
我的指挥官会直接领导他们工作 你们的指挥官要和他们一块工作
My officers will direct them. Your officers will work beside them.

324
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,290
那要由尼科尔森来决定
That's for Nicholson to decide.

325
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,300
而且就像他说的那样 这样做是违背条约的
As he said, it's against the rules.

326
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,630
别和我谈什么条约
Do not speak to me of rules.

327
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
这是战争！
This is war!

328
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,970
并不是什么公平的游戏
This is not a game of cricket.

329
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,640
你的上校是个疯子
He's mad, your colonel...

330
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,980
完全是疯了
...quite mad.

331
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,940
请坐
Sit down, please.

332
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,410
我决定了 只让你一个人去看你们的上校
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.

333
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,120
谢谢
Thank you.

334
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,830
告诉他 如果他的指挥官还不参加劳动的话…
Tell him that if his officers will not work...

335
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,040
我将不得不关闭医院…
...l'll be forced to close the hospital...

336
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,670
然后你的病人将替他们劳动
...and your patients will work in their place.

337
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,260
会死掉一些人 这全都要怪他
Many will die, and he will be responsible.

338
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,970
去和他讲你只有5分钟时间
Go and speak to him. You have five minutes.

339
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,630
医生要去看那老伙计了
Doc's going to see the old man.

340
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,760
长官…
Sir....

341
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,600
是科林普顿 长官
It's Clipton, sir.

342
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,560
我给你带来些东西
I brought you a few things.

343
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,450
- 我的部下怎么样了？ - 他们还好 长官
- How are the men? - Fine, sir, fine.

344
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,870
我们给您凑了点肉和一个椰子
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.

345
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,540
军官们怎么样？
And the officers?

346
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,420
不太好 他们还在关禁闭
Not so good. They're still in detention.

347
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,960
詹宁斯上尉死了
And Lieutenant Jennings.... Jennings is dead.

348
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,710
- 什么？ - 在逃跑的时候被枪打死了
- What? - Killed, attempting to escape.

349
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,430
还有维佛下士和那个美国人
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.

350
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,140
詹宁斯 真可怜 勇敢的小伙子
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

351
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,560
我警告过他 对不对？
I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?

352
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,650
长官 我们时间不多了
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

353
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,440
我一边给你清理 一边说
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.

354
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,820
我有些事情要告诉你
I've got something to tell you.

355
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,530
我和Saito吵过了
I've just had a word with Saito.

356
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,450
那个家伙是我遇过的最差的指挥官
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.

357
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,750
他是个疯子 你说
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

358
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,220
讹诈！
Blackmail!

359
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,100
我知道 长官 但他是认真的
I know, sir, but he means it. I'm sure he does.

360
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,980
很简单 这是个关于面子的问题 但他是不会屈服的
It's a question of face, pure and simple. And he can't give in.

361
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,570
但那仍然是讹诈
It's still blackmail.

362
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,330
长官 你是撑不过他的
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.

363
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,750
我们那些军官被憋在那个闷室里也不是办法
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?

364
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,000
我们的士兵在尽量地拖延工期
The men are doing a wonderful job. They're going as slow as they dare.

365
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,300
但是Saito在削减他们的食物配额…
But Saito's cut their food rations...

366
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,630
并且一旦他让病人去工作…
...and if he makes the sick men work....

367
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,680
很显然就会死很多人
Well, they're going to die. That's all there is to it.

368
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,720
是的 科林普顿 我很清楚
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

369
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,520
但是你看到了吗 这关乎原则
But don't you see? It's a matter of principle.

370
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,560
如果我们现在屈服了 就会无休无止 不行
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it. No.

371
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,070
长官 我们陷在雨林里 远离文明
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.

372
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,990
我们是在一个为了达到自己目的可以不择手段的家伙的统治下 更别说原则了
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way. Principle!

373
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,370
没有人会知道这儿发生了什么 也不会有人关心
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.

374
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,130
退一步吧 长官 求求你了
Give in, sir. Please!

375
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,840
我不会动摇的
I'm adamant.

376
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,800
我不会让我的军官去象一个小工一样干苦力
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.

377
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,720
- 时间到 - 好的
- Time. - All right.

378
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,510
谢谢关心我的人
Please thank those concerned.

379
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,640
医院里的每个人都献了一片肉
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.

380
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,520
雷诺兹偷了个椰子
Reynolds stole the coconut.

381
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,900
我们还会给你带来食物的
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.

382
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,610
我们已经贿赂了一个看管你的守卫
We've bribed one of your guards.

383
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,490
再见 长官 祝好运
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

384
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,620
多谢
Many thanks.

385
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,630
你说那个美国人被打死了
Did you say that American was killed?

386
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,010
是的 长官 被枪打倒后淹死了
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

387
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,600
计划逃跑真是个愚蠢的念头
It's insane to plan escapes.

388
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,680
3人被杀 结果怎么样呢
Three men killed, and to what end?

389
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,190
时间到！
Time!

390
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,480
我们在这里一定能胜利
Here is where we must win through.

391
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,750
医生看着我们并摇摇头 什么意思
Doc just looked at us and shook his head. Whatever that means.

392
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,550
只有一个意思 上校不会屈服
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.

393
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,650
怎么样
Well?

394
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,570
是这样的
It's like this.

395
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,490
尼科尔森上校不准备向武力屈服
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.

396
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,860
这是个原则的问题
It's a question of principle.

397
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,570
作为医疗官 我抗议对他的折磨
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.

398
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,790
他还能活着 真是奇迹
It's a wonder he's still alive.

399
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,000
如果发生悲剧 那和谋杀是一样的
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.

400
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,340
要怪就怪他
He is responsible.

401
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,050
不是我
Not l.

402
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,930
你病了？
You sick?

403
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,770
他们都疯了吗
Are they both mad?

404
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
或者我也要发疯了？
Or am I going mad?

405
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,700
太阳也疯了？
Or is it the sun?

406
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,800
立正！
Attention!

407
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,760
全体立正
Battalion, attention.

408
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,760
英军俘虏们
English prisoners.

409
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,480
让我们问一个问题…
Let us ask the question...

410
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,900
…为什么大桥进展迟缓
...why does the bridge not progress?

411
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,570
你们知道为什么 因为你们的指挥官是懒惰的
You know why, because your officers are lazy!

412
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,240
他们认为自己高人一等 而不愿和你们分担
They think themselves too good to share your burden.

413
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,780
这是不公平的
This is not just.

414
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,200
所以 你们工作起来也不愉快
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.

415
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,420
所以 大桥也没有什么进展
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.

416
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,210
但是还有一个原因
But there is another cause.

417
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,510
我不避讳事实
I do not hide the truth.

418
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,630
我很惭愧…
With deep shame and regret...

419
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,180
…我承认也是由于我们的一个小日本狗屎
...l admit to you the failure...

420
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,260
…的无能
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

421
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,720
我是指 Miura上尉
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

422
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,390
他是一个很差的工程师
He is a bad engineer.

423
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,900
他的指挥毫不称职
He is unworthy of command.

424
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,860
所以 我把他撤换了
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.

425
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,620
明天 我们重新开始
Tomorrow we begin again.

426
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,370
我会亲自指挥
I shall be in personal command.

427
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,960
今天 我们休息
Today we rest.

428
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,550
只有工作而没有娱乐会很不爽的！
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!

429
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,510
为了你们明天努力工作…
As token of regard for your efforts in the future...

430
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,300
…我给你们每个人一份礼物
...l give presents to you all.

431
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,020
工作愉快
Let us be happy in our work.

432
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,700
解散
Company, dismissed.

433
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:19,580
全体解散
Battalion, dismissed.

434
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,380
嘿 看看
Hey, take a look at this.

435
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,300
红十字！ 他把我们的…
Red Cross! He's given us our...

436
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,510
嘿 他把我方的红十字包裹发给我们
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.

437
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,060
"明天重新开始"
"Tomorrow we begin again."

438
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,540
嘿 哈里 看！
Hey, Harry, look!

439
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,590
他们要把老伙计放出来了
They're letting the old man out.

440
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,150
看来 他们要再毒打他一顿
Most likely going to give him another pasting.

441
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,950
晚上好 上校
Good evening, colonel.

442
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
愿意过来坐一坐吗？
Do you mind sitting over here?

443
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,750
我晚饭还没有吃
I am having rather a late supper.

444
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,200
英国咸牛肉
English corned beef.

445
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,700
不用 谢谢
No, thank you.

446
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,540
产自苏格兰
Produce of Scotland.

447
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,500
我宁愿它是日本米酒
I prefer it to sake.

448
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,670
我在伦敦呆了3年
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.

449
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,590
我在伦敦工艺学校学习
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

450
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,550
敬你！
Cheers!

451
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,390
抱歉
Sorry.

452
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,480
下次？
Later, perhaps?

453
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,350
也许
Perhaps.

454
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,280
我不是一个好的艺术家
I was not a good artist.

455
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,820
我爸爸不赞成我搞艺术
My father disapproved.

456
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,490
他觉得我应该在军队发展
He felt I belonged in the army.

457
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,290
所以我放弃了艺术 改学工程
So I changed from art to engineering.

458
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,080
我必须告诉你 Saito上校
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

459
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:42,090
我要将你的行为写一份完整的报告
I intend to make a full report of your activities.

460
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,220
我不认为你理解我的处境
I do not think you quite realize my position.

461
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,020
- 我必须执行给我的命令 - 噢 当然
- I must carry out my orders. - Oh, quite, quite.

462
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:59,190
我必须在5月12号之前完成大桥
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.

463
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,110
- 我只有12个星期多一点 - 是的
- I have only 1 2 weeks more. - No doubt.

464
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,110
所以 我必须启用我手上的任何一个人
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.

465
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,200
军官不行 除非是管理工作
No officers, except for administration.

466
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,580
但是在这条铁路线上 所有的军官都在工作
But officers are working along the entire railway.

467
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,450
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it. I know it.

468
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,580
其他地方的军官我不管
I'm not responsible for other officers.

469
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,290
从我个人来讲 我很震惊
Personally, I'm appalled.

470
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,920
别激动
Let's not get excited.

471
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,050
来枝雪茄吗？
Will you have a cigar?

472
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,260
不 谢谢
No. Thank you.

473
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:38,770
当我说所有的指挥官都要劳动的时候…
When I said all officers must work...

474
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,440
…事实上是指少尉至上校阶级之各指挥官 并没有包括你
...naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.

475
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,900
我的命令只适用于下级军官…
My orders were only intended for officers below...

476
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,200
任何军官都不能做苦力劳动
No officers will do manual labour.

477
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,740
拜托！ 我是要说:
Please! I was about to say:

478
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,290
我通盘考虑过了
I've thought the matter over and have decided...

479
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,000
…我要让他们大部分做管理工作
...to put majors and above on administrative duties...

480
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,000
…只有很低级的军官去劳动
...leaving only junior officers to work.

481
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,800
不行 公约关于这个的规定很清楚
No. The Convention's quite clear on that point.

482
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:26,150
你知道如果大桥不能准时建成 我会怎样？
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?

483
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,030
一点也不知道
I haven't the foggiest.

484
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,900
我必须自杀
I'd have to kill myself.

485
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,030
如果你是我 你会怎样？
What would you do if you were me?

486
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,160
如果我是你…
I suppose if I were you...

487
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,080
…我想我会自杀
...l'd have to kill myself.

488
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,500
敬你
Cheers.

489
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,300
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, colonel...

490
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,010
…在我死之前 其他的人都得死
...if I am to die, others will die before me.

491
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,510
你明白了吗？
Do you understand?

492
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,390
科林普顿并没有这么说
Clipton did mention that.

493
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,100
但那样也不能解决你的问题
That won't solve your problem.

494
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,770
我想我们可以达成一个解决办法
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.

495
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,650
请坐
Please sit down.

496
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,320
请你告诉我 上校…
Now. Tell me, colonel...

497
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,320
你认为军人的天职是服从命令吗？
...do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?

498
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,450
- 当然 - 好的
- Of course. - Good.

499
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,200
现在
Now.

500
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,710
我们来看看你的大桥
Take this bridge of yours.

501
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,630
真是一个巨大的工程
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

502
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,010
坦率地说 我怀疑你的那个叫什么来着的上尉…
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's- his- name...

503
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,090
三浦
Miura.

504
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,890
能胜任这样的工作
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.

505
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,520
另外 我有些军官 比如里夫和休斯…
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance...

506
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,480
…他们在印度到处修桥
...who have built bridges all over lndia.

507
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,190
人们都尊敬他们
The men respect them.

508
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,110
尊重对一个军官来说是很重要的
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.

509
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,490
如果没有尊重 则不能服众
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

510
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,160
然后会怎么样？ 部下漫无纪律 指挥混乱
What then? Demoralization and chaos.

511
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,910
如果让这种情况发生 那么我就是个非常不称职的指挥官
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.

512
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,290
也许你忘记了 修建大桥是由我来指挥的
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.

513
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,300
真的吗  你对进度满意吗？
Really? And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?

514
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,840
- 很不满意！ - 你证明了我的观点
- I am not! - You've proved my point.

515
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,300
我痛恨英国人！
I hate the British!

516
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,680
你们被打败了 还不知羞耻
You are defeated but you have no shame.

517
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,350
你们很顽固 但没有什么值得自豪的
You are stubborn but have no pride.

518
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,600
你们会忍耐 但你们没有勇气
You endure but you have no courage.

519
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,610
我痛恨英国人！
I hate the British!

520
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,610
这样不能解决任何问题
Pointless, going on like this.

521
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,110
站着！
Stay there!

522
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,330
暂停！
Stand down. Stand down!

523
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,340
全体立正！
Battalion, attention!

524
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,090
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

525
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,140
请…
Please....

526
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,310
你知道今天是什么日子吗 上校？
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?

527
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,270
我已经不会记数了
I've lost count.

528
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,310
这是我们1905年
It's the anniversary of our great victory...

529
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,270
大胜俄国人的纪念日…
...over Russia in 1 905.

530
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:28,650
整个东亚都在庆祝这个日子
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.

531
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,740
趁着这个伟大的日子…
In honour of this occasion...

532
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,700
…我给你的部下放了一天假
...l have given your troops a day of rest.

533
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,200
多谢
Many thanks.

534
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,460
我要宣布一个特赦
I am declaring a general amnesty.

535
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,210
你和你的军官可以回到你们的住处
You and your officers may return to your quarters.

536
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,710
作为这个特赦的一部分…
As part of this amnesty...

537
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:50,220
…军官不需要做体力劳动了
...it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.

538
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,710
他做到了！
He's done it!

539
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,980
应该给某些人发勋章
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

540
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,570
你的手下有多少人
How many men in your party?

541
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,780
我不是很清楚 长官
I don't really know, sir.

542
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,160
- 你不清楚  - 通常有12个人
- You don't know? - Twelve, usually.

543
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,710
今早有一个生病了 长官
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.

544
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,290
有三四个人把他抬到医院去了
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.

545
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,630
嗯 他病得很厉害 长官
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

546
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,600
一个下士必须清楚他管辖多少人
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.

547
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
是 长官
Oh, yes, sir.

548
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,690
你的面部神经有问题吗？ 否则 不要那样做鬼脸
Have you a nervous affliction? Stop making those faces.

549
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:34,570
也许你认为很有趣 但不要那样做鬼脸
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.

550
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,980
没有问题 长官
No, sir.

551
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,450
我们必须停止这些作假行为
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.

552
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,750
- 我说 里夫？ - 什么 长官
- I say, Reeves? - Yes, sir?

553
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,510
以前在这类河上修建过大桥吗？
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?

554
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,300
是的 长官 我们在马德拉斯和孟加拉修的桥有半数是这类的
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....

555
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,550
如果这是你负责修建的大桥…
If this were your bridge...

556
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,470
你会怎样来做…？
...how would you get it under way?

557
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,270
怎样来做
Get it under way, sir?

558
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,150
首先 我不会把它修在这里
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.

559
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,570
噢  为什么
Oh, why not?

560
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,360
我可以说…
I was trying to tell you...

561
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:22,490
…小日本不可能再找到比这里糟糕的地点了
...the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.

562
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
你看到这些桥桩了吗？
You see those piles?

563
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,080
他们正在下沉
They're sinking.

564
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:33,330
他们要经常受到压力 而他们不可能支撑的住
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.

565
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,630
那你会在哪里建桥
Where would you build it?

566
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,840
下游较远一点的地方 长官 在那些河道狭窄的地方跨越河流
Further downstream, sir. Across those narrows.

567
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,930
这样两岸都会有坚实的岩床
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.

568
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:47,930
休斯 如果是你负责修建大桥 你会怎么安排人手？
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?

569
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:52,440
绝对不是现在这样子 正如你看到的 太混乱了
Not the way they're doing it. It's chaos, as you can see.

570
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,480
作业互不协调
Uncoordinated activity.

571
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,360
相互没有配合
No teamwork.

572
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,150
很多组的工作相互制约
Some parties are working against each other.

573
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:06,700
是的
Yes.

574
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,370
我说 先生们 我们手上有个难题
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.

575
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,330
感谢小日本所赐 我们在指挥一群乌合之众
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.

576
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,000
没有秩序 没有原则
There's no order, no discipline.

577
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,430
- 我们的任务是要重组军队 - 是的 长官
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion. - Yes, sir.

578
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,510
那并不容易
Which isn't going to be easy.

579
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,260
幸运的是 我们手上有个对象 那座大桥
Fortunately, we have the means at hand. The bridge.

580
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,930
- 那座大桥 长官？ - 是的 那座大桥
- The bridge, sir? - The bridge.

581
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:39,020
我们要展示我们西方的效率 给他们上一课 让他们出出丑
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.

582
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,940
展示我们英军士兵的能力
Show what a British soldier is capable of.

583
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,860
是的 长官 我明白你的意思
Yes. I see your point, sir.

584
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,820
我知道这儿环境很艰苦…
I know how difficult it's going to be here...

585
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,540
…找不到合手的东西
...where you can't find what you need.

586
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,830
- 这是一个挑战 - 请原谅 长官
- There's the challenge. - I beg your pardon, sir.

587
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,580
你真的要给他们修一座大桥？
You really want them to build the bridge?

588
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:59,460
你们平时可不是这么迟钝的
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.

589
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,630
我知道我们的战士 必须让他们有活干
I know our men. You've got to keep them occupied.

590
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,930
如果他们没有事干 我们就找一些给他们做
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.

591
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,050
- 我们会的 长官 - 我们很幸运
- That we would, sir. - So we're lucky.

592
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,810
但是我们还要把它造好
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

593
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,180
我还知道我们的战士
Here again I know the men.

594
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,440
他们需要在工作中寻找自豪感
It's essential that they take pride in their job.

595
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,270
- 对不对 各位？ - 是的 长官
- Right, men? - Yes, sir.

596
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,400
里夫 你是这里的关键人员 你在这里要充当一个工程师
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.

597
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:26,570
告诉我你需要的 我们会尽量去满足 我们能干好吗？
Tell me what you want and we'll get it. Can we make a go of it?

598
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,070
- 我们会干的很漂亮的 长官 - 很好
- We'll do out best, sir. - Fine.

599
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,620
我们必须先制定计划…
We must draw up our plans...

600
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,960
…然后和Saito开个会议…
...then arrange a conference with Saito...

601
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,670
…然后纠正他的错误
...and set him straight.

602
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,430
那些全是程序上的事情
That takes care of all the procedural matters.

603
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:49,930
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

604
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:54,220
下面我要说的可能相关的人员会不高兴
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.

605
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,270
我不得不说 大桥的选址是草率的…
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily...

606
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,770
…嗯 或者说是错误的
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

607
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,650
错误的？
Incorrectly?

608
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,400
很不幸 是的
Unfortunately, yes.

609
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,360
我们的技术人员研究了你们选的地点…
Our engineer has made a study of the site...

610
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:12,950
…认为河床太软
...and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.

611
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,040
太软？
Too soft?

612
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,750
全是泥浆！ 所有的工作都是无用工
Mud! All the work has been useless.

613
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,420
- 里夫 请你继续 - 是的 长官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

614
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,000
- 里夫 请你继续 - 是的 长官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

615
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:26,420
桥墩的受力会把它们压到水面以下的
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.

616
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,470
当第一列火车通过的时候 大桥就会倒塌
It would collapse under the first train.

617
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,970
这是压力和泥土形变的图表 单位是吨/平方英寸
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.

618
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:39,310
里夫 在你深入介绍之前… 上校 我们可以来杯茶吗？
Reeves, before you get too involved.... Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

619
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:56,490
我认为大家都同意了 为了避免灾难…
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster...

620
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:01,870
…我们必须在下游400码的地方 在里夫挑选的地址上建一座新桥
...we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

621
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,300
现在我们来看下一个问题
Let's proceed to the next point.

622
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,710
现在我们来看下一个问题
Let's proceed to the next point.

623
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:11,260
我要改变他们的劳动强度
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.

624
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,180
- 改变劳动强度？ - 我要增加他们的劳动强度
- Alter? - I've increased it.

625
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,970
从挖土15码改成2码
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.

626
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,980
你肯定会赞同这个决定
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.

627
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,520
休斯 你来详细介绍一下
Hughes has all the facts. Would you take over?

628
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,770
我仔细研究了一下整个工程
I've done a time study of the entire project.

629
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:29,860
我认为 作业分配是错误的
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.

630
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,820
我们应该修改作业分配
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.

631
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:39,200
稍等一下 上校 我们边吃边谈可能会节约时间
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.

632
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,910
我们可以有晚饭吃的吧？
Would it be possible to have dinner?

633
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,370
当然
Of course.

634
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,380
- 继续 - 是 长官
- Carry on. - Yes, sir.

635
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:52,470
如果增加班组 细化分工…
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...

636
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,060
…那么 每天的工作量会增加30%
...l'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30?0 .

637
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,480
现在 Saito 上校 我还有一点补充…
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....

638
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:06,310
现在 还有一项决定刻不容缓
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.

639
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,820
当英军士兵在修桥的时候…
As the British will work on the bridge...

640
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,990
…修建铁路的人手就少了
...only a few will be available for railway work.

641
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,160
你必须用你的人来支援铁路的修建…
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang...

642
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:21,950
…那样 铺轨的工作也能尽快的完成
...so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.

643
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,500
我已经下令了
I have already given the order.

644
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,840
我们也必须改变你们的工作强度
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.

645
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,010
我曾想过定为每天15码 这样不会太过疲劳…
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them...

646
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,970
…但是和我们一样是不是更好一些？
...but isn't it best to be the same as ours?

647
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,470
这样也会形成良性竞争
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.

648
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,640
我已经下令了
I have already given the order.

649
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,440
我们会尽善尽美的 对不对 休斯？
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?

650
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,650
我想今晚的议程就到这里
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.

651
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,320
谢谢你的关注 Saito上校
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.

652
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,450
还有问题吗？
Are there any other questions?

653
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,540
我有一个问题
One question.

654
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,700
你能在期限内完成大桥吗？
Can you finish the bridge in time?

655
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,460
坦率地讲 看起来是不可能的
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.

656
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:10,130
当然我们要试一试
But we'll certainly give it a go.

657
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,680
别忘了 我们因为分歧而浪费了一个月…
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement...

658
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,760
…当然那不是我的错
...for which I was not to blame.

659
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,180
还有什么问题吗？
Is there anything else?

660
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,060
没有了
No.

661
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,650
谢谢 会议结束
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

662
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,400
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

663
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:59,970
我希望这些小日本会感激我们所做的
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.

664
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,930
虽然现在我还没有感觉到这一点
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.

665
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,480
- 晚安 科林普顿 - 晚安 长官
- Good night, Clipton. - Good night, sir.

666
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,690
另外 我想告诉你…
By the way, I meant to tell you...

667
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,780
…这里有一些树比较象榆树
...there are trees here similar to elm.

668
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,950
伦敦桥的榆树桩已经支撑了600年了
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.

669
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,280
- 600年 里夫  - 是的 长官
- Six hundred years, Reeves? - Yes, sir.

670
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,620
600年
Six hundred years.

671
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,330
真是奇迹
That would be quite something.

672
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:21,130
我在找一个美国人 他叫 舍尔斯
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.

673
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,640
- 在海滩上 - 谢谢
- Yes, down on the beach. - Oh, thank you very much.

674
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,600
吻一下！
Kiss!

675
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,560
那么多人
Too many eyes.

676
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,320
那么多人
Too many eyes.

677
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,690
你给了我药粉 药片 沐浴 注射 灌肠…
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....

678
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,400
其实我只需要爱
All I need is love.

679
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,490
是的 你只需要爱
It's true. All you really need is love.

680
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:53,420
为什么你这么肯定你想病休？
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?

681
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,960
因为我内心里一直是老百姓 宝贝
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.

682
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,340
而且我一直是性情中人
And I always follow my heart.

683
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,880
吻一下
Kiss.

684
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,520
怎么会那样 司令官
How's that, commander?

685
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,230
不要叫我司令官
Don't call me commander.

686
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,810
太不浪漫了
It's unromantic.

687
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,770
你自己也是个军官
You're an officer yourself.

688
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,940
你会喜欢我叫你宝贝上尉吗？
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

689
01:16:20,190 --> 01:16:22,650
让我们用平民的称呼吧 就叫我"先生"吧
Let's be democratic. Just call me "sir."

690
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,990
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

691
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,320
厚颜无耻
Brass ahoy.

692
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,910
他来找你
He wants you. He's all yours.

693
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,620
- 我要去游泳了 - 别走！
- I'm going for a swim. - Don't leave me!

694
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,790
- 舍尔斯 司令官  - 是的
- Commander Shears? - Yes.

695
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,840
我叫 华登
My name's Warden.

696
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,840
- 你好 - 对不起 打扰了…
- How do you do? - Sorry to intrude...

697
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,550
没事 少校 我习惯了
That's okay, major. I'm used to it.

698
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,800
来点马丁尼酒吗
Like a martini?

699
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,800
谢谢 不用了
That's very kind. I think not.

700
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:47,220
介意我来一点吗
Mind if I have one?

701
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,800
哪里搞来的
How did you get that?

702
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:52,430
有医院就有酒精
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.

703
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,140
噢 那当然
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

704
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,060
嗯 我尽量简洁一些
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

705
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:01,860
我隶属于316部队 那是个比较古怪的部门
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.

706
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:04,570
我们的总部在布坦尼可公园 (Botanical Gardens(植物园))
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.

707
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,070
- 保护稀有植物不被敌人破坏？ - 当然不是
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy? - Not quite.

708
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,200
- 你当真不来一点  - 不 谢谢
- Sure you won't have one? - No, thanks.

709
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:15,370
我们对你工作过的铁路很感兴趣
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.

710
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,920
你可以给我们很多有价值的情报
You could give us no end of valuable information.

711
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,670
嗯 我已经离开那地方已经很多天了…
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days...

712
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,010
…而且我把所知的都告诉你们了
...and I told your people everything I know.

713
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,600
但是你可以用一种更特殊的方式来帮助我们
But you could help us in a rather special sense.

714
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,980
我知道有点强人所难 但是你能否出来去见一下我们
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?

715
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,400
如果你想让我再重复报告一遍的话
If you want to go over the whole thing again.

716
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,320
太好了 路易斯阁下会感激不尽的
Very kind. Lord Louis'll be grateful.

717
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,780
- 谁  - 蒙巴顿
- Who? - Mountbatten.

718
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:46,650
我们是他的部下
We're one of his special pigeons.

719
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:50,620
那么今晚怎么样  8点我会派一辆车来
Shall we say this evening, then? About 8. I'll send a car.

720
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,910
今晚  不行
This evening? Out of the question.

721
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,410
你明早怎么样  10点
Tomorrow morning then? About 1 0?

722
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,170
- 好 就10点 - 多谢
- Okay, 1 0:00. - Thanks very much.

723
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,630
- 再见 - 再见
- Cheerio. - Cheerio.

724
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,090
祝你好运
Good luck.

725
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,170
谢谢
Thanks.

726
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:16,060
你很抱歉 你今晚要让我空等了
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.

727
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:18,350
大错特错
You couldn't be more wrong.

728
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,530
敬礼！
General salute!

729
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,360
敬礼！
General salute!

730
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,360
举枪致敬！
Present arms!

731
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:44,000
- 可以看你的通行证吗？ - 好的
- May I see your pass, please? - Oh, yes.

732
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,850
华登少校的办公室在路的尽头
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.

733
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:15,080
干得好 Jenkins 干得好！
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

734
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:18,830
快 汤姆森用你的匕首
Come along, Thomson. Use your knife, man.

735
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,790
站起来！快去指定地点
On your feet! Away to the debriefing room.

736
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,250
站起来！快去指定地点
On your feet! Away to the debriefing room.

737
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,960
快 快点！
Come on, move yourselves! Move quickly!

738
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,640
动作太笨了 乔依斯
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

739
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,850
要立即用匕首捅 乔依斯
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.

740
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,730
你看 他占了主动
You see, he's gained the initiative.

741
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:44,730
停下！ 对不起 长官
Wait a minute! I'm terribly sorry, sir.

742
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,190
- 你对不起  - 是的
- You're sorry? - So am l.

743
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,740
- 我以为你是敌人 - 我是美国人 如果你是指这个的话
- I thought you were the enemy. - I'm American, if that's what you mean.

744
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,910
- 就这样 乔依斯 - 是 长官 对不起 长官
- That'll be all, Joyce. - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

745
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:59,290
- 我能做什么  - 我要找华登上校
- What can I do for you? - I'm going to see Major Warden.

746
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,170
我来带路 他现在应该快下课了
I'll show you the way. He'll finish his lecture any moment now.

747
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:03,870
我来带路 他现在应该快下课了
I'll show you the way. He'll finish his lecture any moment now.

748
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:13,260
- 他现在下课了 - 这么大的声音
- That's the end of his lecture. - Thunderous ovation.

749
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,640
他认为训练越接近实战越好
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.

750
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:22,230
- 华登少校 - 嗯？
- Major Warden, sir? - Yes?

751
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,890
很高兴见到你
Good of you to come.

752
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,860
- 他们待你还好吧   - 确实是的
- They took care of you? - They certainly have.

753
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,190
谢谢你 跟我来
Thank you, staff. Well, come along, then.

754
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,280
格林上校要见你
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.

755
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:39,830
- 这个地方还不错吧  - 我不知道这里还是一所军事学校
- Fascinating place, isn't it? - Didn't know it was a commando school.

756
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,960
我们尽量不用这种称呼 那样会制造紧张空气
We're trying to discourage the use of that word. Such a melodramatic air.

757
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:46,630
你在这里干什么
What do you do here?

758
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,250
爆破 摧毁一类的事情
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.

759
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,510
我们使用 PE 塑胶炸药 很不错的东西
We're using P.E., plastic explosives. It's wonderful.

760
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,380
刚才那个爆炸的炸药只有这个一半大
That pop was made with a lump half this size.

761
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:59,100
只要硝化甘油炸药的一半 而威力却有两倍
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.

762
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,310
没引爆的情况下是很安全的
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.

763
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,190
谢谢你的介绍
Thanks for telling me.

764
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:08,860
它完全防水 而且可塑性很好
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.

765
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,270
看到吗？你可以用它来做你想用它做的事情
See? You can do what you like with it.

766
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:13,780
这是我的办公室
This is my place.

767
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,660
这里
Go ahead.

768
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:24,920
喔 渴死了 我要来杯茶
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

769
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,590
- 你也来一杯  - 不 谢谢
- Would you care for one? - No, thanks.

770
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,010
- 来杯酒？ - 不 谢谢
- A drink? - No, thank you.

771
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:35,350
- 给我来壶茶 彼得 - 是的 长官
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter. - Very good, sir.

772
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,610
这个你也看得懂
Do you read this?

773
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,740
战前 我在剑桥教东方语言
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.

774
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:52,250
我还没有祝贺你的成功逃亡呢 干得好！
I never congratulated you on your escape. Good show!

775
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:56,330
如果你的海上救援飞机没有看到我 我也不会呆在这里
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

776
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,290
是的 我想不会
No, I suppose not.

777
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,130
你愿意再来看看你逃出来的地方吗
Would you like to see where you were?

778
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,010
好的
All right.

779
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,270
我们的情报很有限 主要来源于你的报告
Our information's scanty. It's based on your report.

780
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,310
我们认为战俘营在这里
We think the camp's here.

781
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,400
你们是否有尼科尔森上校的消息
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?

782
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:21,690
他很勇敢 要枪毙他时 他也不眨一下眼睛
He had guts. They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

783
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,110
当你要被枪毙的时候 你本来就什么也不能做
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.

784
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:29,830
这里是桂河 这里是你求助的村子
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.

785
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,660
这里是铁路
Here is the railway.

786
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,580
你肯定非常熟悉这一带
You must be fairly familiar with this area.

787
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:37,340
不 大部分时间我脑袋里只是一片空白
No, I was out of my head half the time.

788
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:41,170
铁路从新加坡开始 经过马来西亚…
The railway starts down here in Singapore. Malaya...

789
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:46,300
…曼谷 仰光 他们想一直贯通到印度
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea is to drive on through, into lndia.

790
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,020
- 我是在哪里被救起的？ - 在这里附近
- Where was I picked up? - Oh, about here.

791
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:55,230
日军想在五月中旬贯通曼谷和仰光
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-  Rangoon section by the middle of May.

792
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,570
我们必须阻止他们
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.

793
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,650
太远了 轰炸机飞不到这里
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.

794
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,200
我们必须用地面部队把它摧毁
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.

795
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:06,080
- 那你想怎么办？ - 空降之后 徒步到那里
- How? - Parachute drop, then march.

796
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,210
带着爆破装置穿过雨林吗？
With demolition equipment through that jungle?

797
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:13,830
我们的主要问题是对那里一无所知
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.

798
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,630
我们没有人到过哪里
You see, none of us have ever been there.

799
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,090
- 我其实不想让你失望 但是… - 那很有趣
- I don't want to discourage... - It should be interesting.

800
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,260
格林上校把桂河大桥交给我了 我要带一队人去炸掉它
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge. I'm taking a team in to blow it up.

801
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,560
你真幸运
Lucky you.

802
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:31,730
你真的不想来点茶？
Sure you won't have tea?

803
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:36,530
不 谢谢 我不想失礼 但是我在2点钟要和一个漂亮的姑娘约会
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.

804
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,490
- 如果还有问题的话… - 很抱歉 是的
- If there are any questions.... - Of course, I'm sorry.

805
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,330
嗯 只有一个问题
Well, there is only one question, actually.

806
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,040
你觉得再去哪里一趟怎么样？
How would you feel about going back?

807
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,340
什么
Come again?

808
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,220
在某种情况下 有点儿…
Under the circumstances it's a bit much...

809
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,590
…但是你是我们完成这个任务的关键
...but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.

810
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,640
我们很希望你能和我们一起去
We'd love to have you with us.

811
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,980
这就是你找我来这里的原因？
That's why you brought me here?

812
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:07,730
来请我再去哪里一趟
To ask me this?

813
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,690
嗯 坦率的说 是的
Well, frankly, yes.

814
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,610
我才从那里逃出来
I just got out of there.

815
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,950
我能从那里逃出来 简直是个奇迹 而你现在却让我再回去！ 真荒唐！
My escape was a miracle. Now you want me to go back! Ridiculous!

816
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,450
我知道这很令人为难…
This is embarrassing...

817
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:21,370
我不属于你们的部队 我隶属于美国海军
I don't belong to you. I belong to the American Navy.

818
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,540
事实上 格林上校和你的部队讨论过这件事
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.

819
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:29,590
- 和我的部队  - 你的海军把你转借给我们
- With my people? - Your Navy's turned you over to us.

820
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:33,590
昨天早上 从太平洋舰队指挥部来了一个命令…
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific...

821
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,890
确认把你暂借给316部队
...authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.

822
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,930
- 他们不能这样做！ - 恐怕他们不这样认为
- They can't do this! - I'm afraid they have.

823
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,930
很遗憾告诉你这个消息
It was hard to break it to you.

824
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:48,690
但是他们不能这样对我 海军搞错了！
But they can't do this to me. I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake!

825
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:56,620
你看 我不是海军司令官 我甚至不是一名军官
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.

826
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:02,040
整个事情都不是真的 我只是一个擦炮筒的普通士兵
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

827
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,630
当休斯顿号沉没的时候 我和一名真正的司令官上岸
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.

828
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,050
我们碰上了日军巡逻队 他被打死了
We ran into a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

829
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:15,590
我认为只是时间问题 直到我…
I figured it was just a matter of time till l...

830
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,680
所以你和死人换了服装
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.

831
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:22,890
我认为在战俘营中军官会受到较好的待遇
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.

832
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:26,730
但是我遇到的Saito 他命令指挥官和其他人一起劳动
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.

833
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,530
总是有意想不到的事情 对不对
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

834
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:35,030
我已经有点习惯当司令官了…
I kind of got used to being a commander...

835
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,540
…所以当我来到医院的时候…
...so when I arrived at the hospital...

836
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:42,920
…我看了一下普通战士的病房和指挥官的病房…
...l took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward...

837
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:47,760
…然后我对自己说 "就继续冒充一些时间吧"
...and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."

838
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,720
军官还真有优待
There were certain advantages.

839
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,800
我在海滩上就看到一个
I saw one of them on the beach.

840
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,220
这就是整个故事
That's the whole story.

841
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:58,390
问题是 你不能用我 你需要的是一名指挥官…
The point is, you can't use me. You want an officer...

842
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,520
…一个并不存在的美军司令官舍尔斯
...an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.

843
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:04,230
当海军发现了真相 他们会说:
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:

844
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,280
"由于假扮指挥官 把他遣送回家"
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."

845
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,070
- 一旦结果是那样 我就成功了 - 你就怎样
- Once that happens, I've got it made. - Got it what?

846
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,780
成功了！ 我现在想喝点酒
Made! I'd like that drink now.

847
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,290
我想申请病退
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

848
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:22,460
我会说假装指挥官是由于在森林中得了神经病
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.

849
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,760
甚至 有时我觉得我是海尔森海军舰队司令
I'm getting worse. Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

850
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:30,220
很聪明的计划
It's quite a clever plan.

851
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,560
不仅仅是是聪明的计划 而且是简单安全的
Not only clever, it's foolproof.

852
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,140
如果海军发现了我的真实身份
If my Navy finds out who I am...

853
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:40,400
那份命令就是一张废纸
...those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.

854
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,000
这是你的照片吗？
Isn't this your photograph?

855
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,710
- 从哪里搞到的  - 由于你的部队不能确认你的身份…
- Where did you get this? - It took some doing...

856
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,380
…就费了些事
...since your people couldn't identify you.

857
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:09,430
最后你的太平洋舰队发了一份你的服役档案过来
Finally your C- in- C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.

858
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,680
照片和指纹 你愿意看看吗
The photograph, fingerprints. Would you care to have a look?

859
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:20,020
我们知道你的真实身份已经有一个星期了
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.

860
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,490
你的海军处在一个两难的境地
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

861
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,950
一方面你是个英雄…
In one sense you're a hero...

862
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,870
…成功逃出雨林
...for making an escape from the jungle.

863
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:34,040
同时 因为你假扮指挥官
At the same time, they can't bring you home...

864
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,750
他们又不好把你送回家 然后颁发一枚海军十字勋章给你
...and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.

865
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,340
我想因此他们很乐意把你转交给我们
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.

866
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,170
你明白了吗？
You see?

867
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,510
棘手的问题
Hot potato.

868
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,760
说到你的军阶
As far as your rank is concerned...

869
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:51,140
在316部队 我们并不在意那个
...we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.

870
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,770
你可以假装你是少校
You'd have the simulated rank of major.

871
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,820
假装上校 那意味着…
A simulated major. That figures.

872
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,740
嗯…
Well....

873
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,370
我最好是志愿参加
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.

874
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:10,580
很好！
Good show!

875
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,750
格林上校 长官
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

876
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,130
这是舍尔斯上校 他志愿帮助我们炸掉那座桥
This is Major Shears. He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.

877
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,920
真的？
Really?

878
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,680
很好！
Good show!

879
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:26,760
太好了 上校！
Jolly good show, major!

880
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:18,990
去医务室吧 这只脚感染了
Get up to sick bay. This foot's infected.

881
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,330
上校会以为我在装病
Colonel might think I'm malingering.

882
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,330
我是医疗官快去吧！
I'm the medical officer. Get cracking!

883
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,920
有人愿意告诉我为什么他想建一座真的大桥吗
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?

884
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:37,680
不要担心老尼克他知道自己在干什么
Don't worry about old Nick. He knows what he's doing.

885
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:52,280
嘿 柯林普顿该给我们展示一下了
Hello, Clipton. About time you paid us a visit.

886
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,110
我们的小伙子干得真不错
Fine job our chaps are doing.

887
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,700
是的 他怎么样？
Yes. How's he behaving?

888
01:29:57,950 --> 01:30:00,660
当我们接管过来以后 他已经变得很讲理了
He's been most reasonable since we took over.

889
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:03,790
- 他在想什么  - 我不清楚
- What's he thinking? - I haven't the foggiest.

890
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,040
- 谢谢你 里夫 - 好的 长官
- Thanks, Reeves. - Right, sir.

891
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,130
你怎么看
What do you think?

892
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,670
绝对是个挑战  对不对
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

893
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,180
你真认为建这座桥是个好主意吗
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?

894
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,010
- 你是认真的吗  - 是的 长官
- Are you serious? - Yes, sir.

895
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:23,980
一个好主意吗？ 我们再看看
A good idea? Take another look.

896
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,820
你不认为他们士气很高吗  你不认为军纪又得到恢复了吗
You don't agree morale is high? Discipline has been restored?

897
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,110
你不认为他们的待遇得到提高了吗
Their condition has improved?

898
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,900
他们难道没有更快乐了一些了吗
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?

899
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,530
他们吃得也好了 再也得不到虐待
They feed better and they are no longer abused.

900
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:41,960
坦率地说 柯林普顿 有时我一点也不了解你
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.

901
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:44,130
让我说得更清楚一些
I'll try to make myself clear.

902
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,250
事实上 我们所作的事情可以被理解为…
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as...

903
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:51,510
…对不起 长官 是通敌合作
...forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.

904
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,390
甚至可以被认为是叛国罪
Perhaps even treason.

905
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:57,680
我们是战俘 我们没有权利拒绝劳动
We're prisoners of war. We haven't the right to refuse to work.

906
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:01,140
我知道 长官 但是我们一定要做得这么好吗
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?

907
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:04,440
我们一定要做得比他们自己还好吗
Must we do better than they could themselves?

908
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,860
如果你替Saito做手术 你是会尽力治好他还是杀死他
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?

909
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,660
你难道不认为懒散会击垮我们
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?

910
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:16,740
让世人说我们连一件正常的工作都不会做
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?

911
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:21,960
这很重要 要让他们知道 他们不可能在身体或精神上打垮我们
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.

912
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,460
好好看看 柯林普顿
Take a good look, Clipton.

913
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,380
有一天 当战争结束
One day the war will be over.

914
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:30,840
我希望将来那些使用这座桥的人…
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come...

915
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:34,310
…会记住它是怎么样被建成的 是谁修建了他们
...will remember how it was built, and who built it.

916
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,690
不是一群奴隶 而是一群战士 是一群英国战士 甚至是在被俘的情况下修建的
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers. British soldiers, even in captivity.

917
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,440
- 是的 长官 - 你是一个好医生
- Yes, sir. - You're a fine doctor...

918
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:45,530
但是对于战争 你还要学习很多
...but you've a lot to learn about the army.

919
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,800
抓住他！ 抓住他！
Hold him! Hold him!

920
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:15,140
用脚！
Use your boot! Get your boot in there, will you?

921
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,900
早上好！
Good morning!

922
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,590
你们到底在看什么
What on earth are you people staring at?

923
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,380
用脚踹倒他！
Get him with your boot!

924
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,480
对不起我来迟了 长官
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

925
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:03,570
迟到4分钟 你在做内科检查吗？
Four minutes, to be exact. You were in need of medical attention?

926
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:06,450
- 对不起 长官？ - 我是指那个女护士
- Sir? - I was referring to the nurse.

927
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:10,040
足智多谋 华登 说的一点也不错
Very ingenious. Warden was right.

928
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,660
请坐
Sit down.

929
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:16,710
我请你来这里 是要你挑选行动小组里的第四个人
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.

930
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,630
- 请乔伊斯先生进来 - 是的 长官
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in. - Yes, sir.

931
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:23,050
查普曼想要乔伊斯 但是我有疑虑
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.

932
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:27,100
他有太多的想象力了
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.

933
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,390
我已经告诉过你…
I've told you...

934
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:33,060
…在这个任务中 总会有万一
...in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.

935
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:35,690
他在学校里是游泳最好的
He's the best swimmer in the school.

936
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:40,240
我早已清楚你的观点 我现在要舍尔斯的意见
I'm well aware of your evaluation. The opinion I want is Shears'.

937
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:45,660
好的 稍息
All right, at ease.

938
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:54,080
这些人想带你到雨林一游
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.

939
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:55,670
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

940
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:58,590
你在蒙特利尔是个会计师？
You were an accountant in Montreal?

941
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,010
是的 长官 但还不是个正式的会计师
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant.

942
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,390
因为我还没有得到许可证
That is, I didn't have my charter.

943
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,010
那么你实际上做什么呢？
Exactly what did you do?

944
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:09,230
嗯 长官 我只是核算数据…
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures...

945
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,940
…核算那些别人核算过的数据…
...which people had checked before me...

946
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:15,610
…然后别人再核算我核算过的数据
...and other people checked them after I had checked them.

947
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,070
- 听起来很烦人 - 长官 是很烦人
- Sounds a frightful bore. - Sir, it was a bore.

948
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,910
你怎么会在这里的？
How did you wind up here?

949
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:26,240
1939年 我去伦敦应征 后来 我志愿来到这里
In '39 I came over to London to enlist. Later I volunteered for this work.

950
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:30,250
- 你是志愿的！ - 是的 长官 你看 正规部队…
- You volunteered! - Yes, sir. See, the regular Army...

951
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,130
请继续 你可以很坦率地说
Go ahead, you can be frank.

952
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:37,630
嗯 正规部队使我回想起我原来的工作
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.

953
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,090
他们不需要你去思考
They don't expect you to think.

954
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,060
那你思考这个看看
Think about this.

955
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,310
你能用它来杀人吗
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?

956
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,060
我知道怎么使用它
I know how to use it.

957
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:53,320
不是那意思 我问你能用它来杀人吗
That's not what I meant. Could you use it in cold blood?

958
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:55,940
你可以毫不犹豫地杀人吗
Could you kill without hesitation?

959
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:02,120
这个问题我曾经问过自己 它很困扰我
That's a question I've asked myself. It's worried me quite a bit.

960
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,290
那么答案是什么？
And what was the answer?

961
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,790
事实上 我并不知道答案 长官
I don't honestly know, sir.

962
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:10,130
我曾经试图想象自己…
I've tried to imagine myself....

963
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,970
我很难使自己相信杀戮不是犯罪
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.

964
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,640
那是军队里的一个古老的问题
It's an old army problem.

965
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:22,430
嗯 好了 谢谢你 乔伊斯
Well, I think that's all. Thank you, Joyce.

966
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,480
我可以参加行动了吗
Am I to go with the team?

967
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,270
我们会让你知道的
We'll let you know.

968
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:38,070
你们看到了吧
You see what I mean.

969
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,200
嗯 至少他是诚实的
Well, at least he was honest.

970
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:44,960
不到那时候 我们谁也不知道答案
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.

971
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:47,460
你的意见呢 舍尔斯
What's your opinion, Shears?

972
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,670
嗯 他是加拿大人
Well, he's Canadian.

973
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,920
正好吻合我们这个多国组合行动
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.

974
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:56,760
如果他想去 他可以替我去！
If he wants to go, he can take my place!

975
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:01,060
嗯 如果大家都同意乔伊斯去 那就让他们参加吧
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.

976
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:04,810
我们对那个村庄进行了空中侦察
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.

977
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:08,020
你们可以在晚上空降到那里
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.

978
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:11,490
- 你经过跳伞训练吗  - 没有 长官
- You've had parachute training? - No, sir.

979
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,410
该死！ 这个可麻烦了
Blast! This is awkward.

980
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,870
从来没遇到过这样的事情！
Silly, it never occurred to me!

981
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:18,490
也许 我可以不…
Well, maybe...

982
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:21,660
我们可以给他安排一些训练
He's right. Arrange some practice jumps for him.

983
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,790
我现在就去安排
I'll go check right away.

984
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,090
- 好的 查普曼 你也可以走了 - 是的 长官
- All right, Chapman, you can run along. - Yes, sir.

985
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,720
嗯  是不是很简单
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

986
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:33,340
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

987
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,260
你不知道你是多么的重要
You don't realize what a plum you are.

988
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,020
你熟悉那地区 你和那村庄里的人结交朋友
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.

989
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:44,400
就好像整个逃跑 都是我们计划好的
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.

990
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:51,700
这里有些东西 你可能会感兴趣 新的" L"药片
By the way, here's something that'll interest you. The new " L" pill.

991
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:56,290
- " L"药片  - 致命毒药 迅速 无痛
- L pill? - L for lethal. Instant, painless.

992
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:59,830
比老的型号要好很多 当然是为了被俘时使用
Much better than the old ones. For capture, of course.

993
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,580
你是想告诉我不要被活捉
You're telling me not to be taken alive.

994
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:04,630
算我没说
I wouldn't recommend it.

995
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:09,340
如果你们谁受伤了 其他人会把他扔在身后的
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.

996
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,930
在这次行动中 炸毁目标是第一要务
The objective comes first in our work.

997
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,180
你想听我对这小组的真实评价吗？ 在他们面前我没有说
You want my honest evaluation? I didn't want to say in front of them.

998
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:19,230
我明白 请讲
I understand, go ahead.

999
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:23,940
嗯 查普曼很好 在他血管里流的是冰水
Well, Chapman will be fine. Ice water in his veins.

1000
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:26,940
乔伊斯 吗… 他会好的
Joyce is.... He'll be okay.

1001
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,860
- 华登 我觉得不行 - 为什么？
- It's Warden I don't get. - Oh? Why not?

1002
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:31,820
他只是个剑桥老师
Cambridge don and all of that.

1003
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,620
他就像个玩鞭炮的孩子…
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...

1004
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:38,210
他经验很丰富的
He's not without experience, you know.

1005
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:43,050
当新加坡陷落的时候 他在后面炸掉了几座大桥
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

1006
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,550
还在小日本抓住他之前 安装了好几个装置
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.

1007
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,300
- 真精彩 他… - 长官 有些麻烦
- Fascinating story. He... - Sir, it's most annoying.

1008
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:55,140
从时间上考虑 他们认为练习跳伞意义不大
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.

1009
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:59,310
如果你跳一次 只有50%机会受伤
If you make one jump there's only a 50?0 chance of injury.

1010
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:03,150
跳两次 80% 3次 他肯定要受伤
Two jumps, 80?0. Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.

1011
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,320
大家的一致的结论是 最好的办法就是让舍尔斯…
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do...

1012
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:10,530
不要训练 直接去跳下去
...is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.

1013
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,830
带不带降落伞
With or without parachute?

1014
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,130
噢 很好！
Oh, very good!

1015
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,340
带不带降落伞！
With or without!

1016
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:23,570
他挂在树上！
He's in the trees!

1017
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:05,240
Yai 说我们不能从你的那条路去桂河
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.

1018
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:09,670
有太多的日军岗哨 我们要迂回到北方穿越原始森林
There are too many Japanese patrols. We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1019
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,170
- 那么谁带路  - Yai
- Then who's going to lead? - Yai.

1020
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,960
他恨日本人 他们抓走了这里所有的男人
He hates the Japanese. They took all his men.

1021
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,970
我们必须用妇女来帮我们搬东西
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.

1022
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,390
- 妇女！ - 她们能胜任的
- Women bearers! - They're capable.

1023
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:35,280
他说在这里过夜很危险
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.

1024
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:39,700
3里外有个日军岗哨 所以我们要在森林里睡觉了
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1025
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:44,660
- 查普曼怎么办  - Yai会把他和伞埋起来
- What about Chapman? - Yai will bury him and his chute.

1026
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:46,540
有什么问题吗
Is there something wrong?

1027
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:52,420
我正在想你会说他们的语言 而我不会
I was just thinking. You speak Yai's language. I don't.

1028
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:56,680
他要带路走我从未走过的路
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.

1029
01:40:56,930 --> 01:41:00,560
那么还要我来干什么呢
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1030
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:05,100
我知道你的感受 但事情总有万一 对不对
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1031
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:07,400
和查普曼讲万一吧
Tell that to Chapman.

1032
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:09,270
我们开始行动吧！
Let's get cracking!

1033
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:14,900
你很可爱
You're lovely.

1034
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,690
可  爱
Lovely.

1035
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,150
工作愉快！
Be happy in your work!

1036
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,610
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1037
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:51,390
蚂蝗
Leeches.

1038
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,480
蚂蝗
Leeches.

1039
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:12,880
她让你别动她会把你背上的蚂蝗弄下来
She's telling you to hold still. She'll take the leeches off your back.

1040
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,590
象你这样的女孩怎么能在这种地方呢
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?

1041
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,340
我会教你说暹罗语
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1042
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:22,090
不 太多的交谈会坏事
No, that would spoil it. Too much talk always spoils it.

1043
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:23,760
那玩意儿怎么了
What's wrong with that thing?

1044
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:27,680
信号太弱了
It's taken an awful beating. I can't get a strong signal.

1045
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:33,060
因为这里又湿又霉！ 雨林里所有的一切都是这样
I'll tell you. It's wet, mildewed! Like everything else in this jungle.

1046
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,190
你最好把它扔掉！
You might as well dump it!

1047
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,490
这里是东京电台 广播结束
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1048
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:47,200
提醒您不要紧张…
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy...

1049
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:50,000
…不要盲动
...and never volunteer for anything.

1050
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,230
如果我们还呆在这里 我们就出不去了
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

1051
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:07,730
- 就快译好了 长官 - 快读！
- I've got it all decoded, sir. - Read it!

1052
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:11,820
是 长官 "1 原来说的大桥已经不再建了
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.

1053
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:14,650
在原址下游的地方 在建新的大桥
New construction downstream from first site.

1054
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:18,990
2 敌人想在通车典礼上从曼谷到仰光
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train...

1055
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:22,160
开出一列专列…满载军队和重要人物
...Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.

1056
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:25,040
估计在13号上午到达目的地
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.

1057
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:28,420
3 同时要炸掉专列
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.

1058
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:31,800
4 好好干 玩的开心" 就是这些
Four, good hunting. Have fun." That's all.

1059
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,840
一列火车和一座大桥！
A train and a bridge!

1060
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:36,300
我们能及时赶到那里吗 长官
Can we get there in time, sir?

1061
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:38,970
Yai说我们还有2- 3天的路程
Yai says we're two to three days away.

1062
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:43,310
如果我们快走的话 我们会在12号日落前赶到那里
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.

1063
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,480
搭上一列火车 很值
It's worth it for the train.

1064
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:49,020
好 我们要尽一切办法 好好干 玩的开心
Oh, by all means. Good hunting. Good show.

1065
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:51,230
玩的开心 干得很好
Jolly good fun. Jolly good.

1066
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,820
如果你没有修好收音机 我们就不会知道还有一列火车
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.

1067
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:58,830
总有万一 对不对？
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1068
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,480
- 半品脱 长官 - 奎宁
- Half a pint, sir. - Quinine.

1069
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:30,860
嗯 我们回头再弄
Well, we'll complete this later.

1070
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:35,240
- 柯林普顿 我们遇到一个问题 - 是吗 长官
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis. - Yes, sir?

1071
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:40,290
我与里夫 和休斯谈过 我们不可能及时建好大桥
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes. We can't finish the bridge on time.

1072
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,120
我们人力不够
We haven't the manpower.

1073
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,670
我已经请指挥官参加劳动 但是还不够
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.

1074
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,500
指挥官也在干活？
The officers are working?

1075
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,510
我解释了情况 他们志愿参加 但是人还不够
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.

1076
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,510
为什么不向 Saito要求一些人
Why not ask Saito for some men?

1077
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,760
这是我们的任务 要用我们自己最大的资源
This is ours. We'll make the most of our resources.

1078
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,890
这就是我为什么来和你谈 我要病人名单
That's why I came to talk to you. The sick list.

1079
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,940
这里都是病人
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.

1080
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:08,860
我并不是责备你 但总有一些人要装病
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.

1081
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:11,530
保持警惕 这就是我要说的
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.

1082
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:13,620
过来 我们来看看
Come along, let's see.

1083
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,950
别动 别动
Don't move, don't move.

1084
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:22,380
Haskins什么病
What's wrong with Haskins?

1085
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:26,260
阿米巴痢疾和发烧 104度
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever. Temperature of 1 04.

1086
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:28,010
好的 我知道了
Right. I see.

1087
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:32,300
这个人呢
And this man?

1088
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:36,470
腿部溃疡 如果我昨天多切一点的话 就可以保住这条腿
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.

1089
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:38,690
要把他派去劳动吗
Want to send him out to work?

1090
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,730
不许胡说八道 柯林普顿
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1091
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:46,280
那个人呢
That man there?

1092
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,740
胳膊感染
His arm's infected.

1093
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:50,320
这些人的伤大多数都不会彻底痊愈
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.

1094
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:55,450
我在想 新鲜空气和轻微的劳动 会比关在这笼子里好些
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.

1095
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:58,710
- 轻微的劳动  - 因为擦伤胳膊就把他放在这里…
- Light duties? - It's not our policy to keep a man...

1096
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,750
- 不符合我们的原则  - 不符合我们的原则
- ...just because he scratched his arm. - Not our policy?

1097
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:07,010
即使状态不佳 但是还是可以利用的
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.

1098
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:10,890
比如清理焊缝啦 收拾现场啦 稍息 贝克
Trimmings and finishing jobs. Stand easy, Baker.

1099
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:14,730
你想去桥上做些轻微的工作吗
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?

1100
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,900
- 随您吩咐 长官 - 很好
- Anything you say, sir. - Good show.

1101
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,650
你呢  有困难吗
You? Nothing difficult.

1102
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,320
- 我会尽力 长官  - 好样的
- I'll try, sir. - Good man.

1103
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:30,830
同志们 不言而喻 我以你们为荣
Look here, men. It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.

1104
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:35,620
但是我们现在遇到困难 如果你们觉得自己能行的话
But we're facing a crisis. For those of you who feel up to it...

1105
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:39,960
能援助我们一下吗  做一些力所能及的事情 搬搬弄弄 涂涂抹抹
...how about lending us a hand? Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1106
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:41,630
怎么样
What do you say?

1107
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,470
- 是的 长官 - 好样的 跟我来吧
- Yes, sir. - Good show. Come on, follow me.

1108
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,080
10分钟
Ten minutes.

1109
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:29,010
要确认他们全都死了
Make sure they're all dead.

1110
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,850
跟我来 乔伊斯
Come on, Joyce.

1111
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,680
用匕首 否则我们会打到自己人
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.

1112
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,660
走那边 乔伊斯
Go that way, Joyce.

1113
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,930
我可以干掉他的 我已经准备好了
I could have done it. I was ready.

1114
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:09,810
你受伤了 长官
Are you hit, sir?

1115
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:11,480
走
Let's go.

1116
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,550
只是表面伤 不会有骨折
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.

1117
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,930
- 是我的错 长官 - 噢 住嘴
- It's my fault, sir. - Oh, shut up.

1118
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,680
我可以走的不很严重
I can walk on it. That's all that counts.

1119
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:43,640
是啊 但是还有多远 我们能走多快呢
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1120
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:46,520
不试不知道  对不对
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?

1121
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,690
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1122
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:03,230
我没有命令停止
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1123
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:04,900
我们都需要休息一下
We all need it.

1124
02:00:08,990 --> 02:00:12,540
我们还要5小时急行军才能到达目标
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.

1125
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,080
也许要6小时
Maybe six.

1126
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,290
快
Come on.

1127
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:19,040
如果你一直走的话 你会流血不止而死的
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.

1128
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:29,680
- 你们必须把我留在这里 - 你停下来 我们就停下来
- You're going to leave me here. - If you stop, we stop.

1129
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,230
你不可能在夜里研究大桥的结构
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.

1130
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:35,560
你们必须在日落前赶到那里
You've got to get there before sundown.

1131
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:40,440
但是 长官 任务结束后 我们不能保证顺这条路返回…
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route...

1132
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:42,820
即使我们走这条路 也不能保证找到你
...or whether we could find you if we did?

1133
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:46,620
如果我是你的话 你知道的 我就一点也不犹豫就会离开你
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.

1134
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:48,280
他不知道 但是我知道
He doesn't know, but I do.

1135
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:52,000
你会把你妈妈抛弃在这里的 如果规则要求这样的话
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.

1136
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:56,170
你们必须继续前进这是命令
You'll go on without me. That's an order.

1137
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,670
舍尔斯 现在由你来指挥
You're in command now, Shears.

1138
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,260
我不遵守这条命令
I won't obey that order.

1139
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,390
你的英雄主义让我恶心
Your heroics make me sick.

1140
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:08,390
你们都带着死亡的臭气
You carry the stench of death like the plague.

1141
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,850
爆炸 L药片
Explosives and L- pills go well together.

1142
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,690
不是这个就是那个 要么毁掉大桥 要么毁掉自己
It's one thing or the other. Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1143
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:16,730
这场战争只是个游戏
This is just a game, this war.

1144
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:20,900
你和那个尼科尔森上校都有疯狂的勇气 为了什么
You and that Colonel Nicholson. You're crazy with courage. For what?

1145
02:01:21,150 --> 02:01:24,110
怎样才能死的象个绅士 怎样死才符合规矩…
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules...

1146
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,080
而问题是要怎样才能象个人那样活着！
...when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!

1147
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,960
我不会让你死在这里的 华登…
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden...

1148
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,170
因为我才不管你那个什么大桥或者你的什么规则
...because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.

1149
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:43,300
如果我们继续前进 我们就一块走
If we go on, we go on together.

1150
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:47,890
老Yai 干得好
Good old Yai.

1151
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:01,030
好的
All right.

1152
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:13,000
快过来
Come on.

1153
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:03,980
我们走近些
Let's get closer.

1154
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,710
还在耿耿于怀我们带你一起来吗？
Still sorry we brought you along?

1155
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:29,300
- 感觉好点了吗？ - 是的
- Feeling better? - Yeah.

1156
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,760
现在还由你指挥
You're in command again, you know.

1157
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,630
谢谢 上校
Thank you, major.

1158
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:39,510
真奇怪这是一座坚固的 设计得很好的大桥
I can't understand it. It's such a solid, well- designed job.

1159
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:45,100
并不象敌人一贯拼凑的的那种东西
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.

1160
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,690
看
Look.

1161
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,570
下面那些可怜的小鬼子
Those poor devils down there.

1162
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:54,660
可以想象他们被逼着在这样的条件下建桥的情景
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.

1163
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,790
还有英国军官在地上工作
They've got a British officer working on his knees.

1164
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,120
小日本好像很高兴
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.

1165
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:05,130
如果他知道我们在这里 肯定可以鼓舞他的士气
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.

1166
02:04:24,610 --> 02:04:27,780
如果不是也要炸那火车 我们就可以设置个定时炸弹 然后跑到几里之外
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.

1167
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:31,030
我们不知道火车明天是什么时间通过这里…
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1168
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,280
我们不得不手动引爆炸药
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1169
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:33,530
我们不得不手动引爆炸药
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1170
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:36,910
我们可以把炸药填在桥墩3尺水面下
We'll set the charges against the piles...

1171
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:40,670
我想…
...about three feet underwater, I should think...

1172
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,250
把主线缆布到下游引爆者那里
...and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.

1173
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:48,340
问题是引爆者应该藏在哪里？
The problem is where to hide it.

1174
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:56,560
我们这一边河流很显然被日军占用
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.

1175
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,770
他们一眼就能发现
They'd spot it at once.

1176
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:05,780
看 你们看到那些树段和它们下面的岩石了吗？
Look. Do you see those fallen tree trunks?

1177
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:09,320
在那边的小沙滩上
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?

1178
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:13,410
- 是的 长官 我看到他们了 - 那里就是我们的引爆位置
- Yes, sir, I see them. - That's our key position.

1179
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:16,040
虽然在河的那边…
The wrong side of the river...

1180
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:19,880
…但是是在有效距离内的唯一藏身之处
...but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.

1181
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,420
当桥被引爆之后…
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1182
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:26,760
…那个人必须游回来
...whoever's there will have to swim back.

1183
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:28,970
这样游泳可不好受
It won't be a pleasant swim.

1184
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:31,760
长官 我的游泳技术是最好的
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.

1185
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,020
看来只能是你了
It looks like your line of country, then.

1186
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:38,060
谢谢
Thank you.

1187
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:42,110
舍尔斯 在这个岸边找个地方掩护乔伊斯
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1188
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:45,280
Yai会和你一起 当小日本发现乔伊斯时
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...

1189
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:47,660
你们可以帮助他
...if they make trouble for Joyce.

1190
02:05:47,910 --> 02:05:50,370
理论上总有万一…
On the theory that there's always one more thing...

1191
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:55,040
我也会在这边用迫击炮牵制他们的
...l'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.

1192
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:58,670
甚至我还可以对火车来几下
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.

1193
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:00,170
都明白了吗
All clear?

1194
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:03,720
还有问题吗 好的 你天一黑就行动
Any questions? Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.

1195
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:06,760
他们肯定在桥上有岗哨…
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge...

1196
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:10,810
所以你必须从上游把炸药送过去
...so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver...

1197
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:12,890
也就是说要扎一个筏子
...which means building a raft.

1198
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:14,140
Yai.

1199
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:21,610
Yai会带3个妇女帮助你
Yai will take three women to help you.

1200
02:06:21,860 --> 02:06:24,950
还有一个要和我呆在一起 好 开始行动！
One will stay here with me. All right, get cracking!

1201
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:34,540
你知道 如果不是脚踝受伤 乔伊斯的任务就是我的了
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1202
02:06:35,170 --> 02:06:37,040
你认为他行吗
You think he'll be all right?

1203
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,760
我觉得可以 要我来处理吗
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1204
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:43,300
如果可以的话 我会让你和迫击炮呆在一起
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.

1205
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:45,180
对不起
I'm sorry.

1206
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:48,430
结束之后 我希望你能得到病休…
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge...

1207
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:50,600
而且是毫不困难地得到
...and not the hard way.

1208
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,060
谢谢
Thanks.

1209
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:31,270
装弹
Load.

1210
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:38,390
真漂亮
Beautiful.

1211
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:40,810
是的 很漂亮
Yes, beautiful.

1212
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:42,890
一流的工程
A first- rate job.

1213
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:45,810
我从未想到会做得这么好
I had no idea it would turn out so well.

1214
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:53,530
是啊 干得很漂亮
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1215
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:56,240
我一直在想…
I've been thinking....

1216
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:01,870
明天就是我服役28年
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.

1217
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:04,790
28年的和平与战争
Twenty- eight years in peace and war.

1218
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:09,800
我呆在家里的时间不超过10个月
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.

1219
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:12,720
当然 这仍然是完美的人生
Still, it's been a good life.

1220
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:16,180
我热爱印度
I love lndia.

1221
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:20,020
我不可能从头再来
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1222
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,390
但是 有时候…
But there are times....

1223
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:29,400
突然你会意识到你又回到了起点
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.

1224
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,950
而你感到彷徨…
And you wonder....

1225
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:35,660
你问自己…
You ask yourself...

1226
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:40,250
…人生的意义是什么…
...what the sum total of your life represents...

1227
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,630
…这样和那样又有什么差别…
...what difference your being there at any time made to anything...

1228
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:47,750
…这样和那样又有什么差别…
...or if it made any difference at all, really.

1229
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:52,760
与其他的职业比起来
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.

1230
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:55,930
我不知道这样想是否正确的…
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy...

1231
02:09:56,510 --> 02:10:00,310
但是我必须承认 我一直在思考这些问题
...but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines...

1232
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,560
但是我必须承认 我一直在思考这些问题
...from time to time.

1233
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:07,360
但 今晚…
But tonight....

1234
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:09,860
今晚…
Tonight....

1235
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:15,080
糟糕
Blast.

1236
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,460
我得走了
I must be off.

1237
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:29,680
他们在准备一些娱乐活动
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.

1238
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:17,850
真可爱
Lovely.

1239
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:30,080
如果你是
If you were the only

1240
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:33,050
世上唯一的女孩
Girl in the world

1241
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:38,380
你是世上唯一男孩
And you were the only boy

1242
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,180
其他的一切都不重要
Nothing else would matter

1243
02:13:41,390 --> 02:13:44,470
在今天
In the world today

1244
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:47,020
我们要相爱
We could go on loving

1245
02:13:47,230 --> 02:13:50,440
用古老的方式
In the same old way

1246
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:56,150
伊甸园只是为两个人而建
A Garden of Eden just made for two

1247
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:31,920
我代表大家说几句…
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1248
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:35,210
这是一个愉快的夜晚
...when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.

1249
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:42,100
明天你们大多数都要转移到一个新的战俘营 开始新的工作
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.

1250
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:46,890
很遗憾你们看不到大桥的首次使用
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.

1251
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,810
你们会很高兴的知道这座大桥
You'll be glad to know that the completion...

1252
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:52,270
所连接的铁路
...of this link in the railway...

1253
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:55,860
可以让我们用火车来
...will enable us to transport the sick and disabled...

1254
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:59,200
把伤病员运输到新的营地
...to the new camp by train.

1255
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:03,790
Saito上校善意的允许
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind...

1256
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:06,330
我和柯林普顿上校留在最后
...with Major Clipton and the sick men...

1257
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:10,080
几天后我们就会会合
...and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.

1258
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:15,260
现在你们这里的工作已经结束了
Now that your work here is finished...

1259
02:19:15,510 --> 02:19:19,550
我想你们有很多人会松弛下来
...l suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.

1260
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:22,350
这完全可以理解
That's quite understandable.

1261
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:25,270
这是很自然的反应
It's a very natural reaction.

1262
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,900
但是某年某月某周某天
But one day, in a week, a month, a year...

1263
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:34,940
在那一天 上帝保佑 我们全部回到自己的家乡
...on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again...

1264
02:19:35,650 --> 02:19:40,780
你会对自己在这里的工作感到自豪
...you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here...

1265
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,830
你会对自己在这里的工作感到自豪
...in the face of great adversity.

1266
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:47,170
你们所做的
What you have done should be...

1267
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,880
我想会是
...and I think will be...

1268
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:54,880
我们国民 战士和市民的榜样
...an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.

1269
02:19:56,090 --> 02:19:58,640
你们光荣地生存下来
You have survived with honour.

1270
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,350
另外
That, and more.

1271
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:05,100
在这个蛮荒之地
Here in the wilderness...

1272
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:08,860
你们转败为胜
...you have turned defeat into victory.

1273
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:13,650
我祝贺你们
I congratulate you.

1274
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:15,240
干得不错
Well done.

1275
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:21,910
为了国王
To the king.

1276
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:05,760
你现在就位了
You're in business.

1277
02:23:05,970 --> 02:23:10,100
还差什么吗  树干 弹药 背包 水壶 匕首
Now, you got everything? Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1278
02:23:11,770 --> 02:23:14,060
我会直接穿过河流
I'll be directly across the river.

1279
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,440
教授说总要以防万一
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.

1280
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:21,360
但我想不起来要防什么
I can't think of what it could be.

1281
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:25,320
除了祝你你长命百岁
Except to wish you a long and happy life.

1282
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:26,830
谢谢
Thank you.

1283
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,020
发生了什么事情
What's happened?

1284
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:50,940
水位降低了
The river's gone down.

1285
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:15,100
可以看到电线了
You can see the wire.

1286
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:17,220
炸药包！
The charges!

1287
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:27,950
别等火车了
Don't wait for the train.

1288
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,330
现在引爆！
Do it now!

1289
02:28:56,900 --> 02:29:00,740
如果Saito是对的 火车在5到10分钟后就会过来
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.

1290
02:29:00,990 --> 02:29:03,740
如果你不介意 我想从山顶上看
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.

1291
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:05,910
为什么  从桥上最好
Why? It's better from the bridge.

1292
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:09,660
很难解释 先生 我不想成为这典礼的一部分
It's hard to explain, sir. I'd rather not be a part of it.

1293
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:14,250
随你 说真的 有时我真不了解你
As you please. Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.

1294
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:18,840
如你所说 长官 我还要好好学习战争
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.

1295
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:27,180
早上好
Good morning.

1296
02:29:27,430 --> 02:29:29,690
夜里水位降低了
River's gone down in the night.

1297
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:15,590
他在干什么？
What's he doing?

1298
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:05,520
上校 有古怪
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.

1299
02:32:05,770 --> 02:32:09,450
我认为在火车到来之前 我们应该检查一下
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.

1300
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,720
他简直疯了
He's gone mad.

1301
02:33:09,930 --> 02:33:12,010
他把他带到那里去了
He's leading him right to it!

1302
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:13,680
可是我们自己人
Our own man!

1303
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:00,820
我是对的 有古怪
I was right. There is something going on.

1304
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:59,300
干掉他 孩子
You've got to do it, boy! You've got to do it now!

1305
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:06,100
你有刀子吗？ 我认为大桥被下了炸药了！
Have you a knife? I just realized the bridge has been mined!

1306
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:07,310
炸药！
Mined!

1307
02:35:07,310 --> 02:35:07,770
炸药！
Mined!

1308
02:35:14,650 --> 02:35:15,730
好小子！
Good boy!

1309
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:23,450
英军指挥官！ 我来炸掉大桥
British officer! Here to blow up the bridge.

1310
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:27,830
- 炸掉大桥！ - 对 长官 英军指挥部的命令
- Blow up the bridge! - Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1311
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:30,710
- 炸掉大桥？！ - 是的 没有时间了！
- Blow up the bridge?! - Yes. There's no time!

1312
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:33,380
不 不行！ 救命！
No, no! Help!

1313
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:42,930
杀掉他！ 杀掉他！
Kill him! Kill him!

1314
02:35:43,310 --> 02:35:45,770
让我走 长官！ 你不明白！
Let me go, sir! You don't understand!

1315
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:49,690
杀掉他！ 杀掉他！
Kill him! Kill him!

1316
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:01,790
杀掉他 乔伊斯！
