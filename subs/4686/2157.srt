Yeah, that's an exit report.
It's not due until you leave.

42
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:58,602

field experience than you.

50
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:14,450
要我怎么可能有更多经验呢
How am I supposed to
get more experience?

51
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,613
我整天都看着四面墙
I'm staring at
four walls all day.

52
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:19,322
我得放弃罗马，然后是柏林

then Berlin.

53

你自己说我的评估非常优秀的

你只要把我的放在Whitford前就行

Matt, I know
this has been hard,

57

但是系统就是这样运行的
but it's the way
the system works.

58
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,870
但不我什么也不能保证
Look, I'll talk to Whitford about
Paris, but I can't promise anything.

59
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:36,032
好吧,我得走了
Look, I've got to go.

60
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,804
不要担心，我会罩着你的，好吗？
Don't worry,
I'm looking after you, okay?

61
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,582
嗯，我知道，我知道

I know, I know.

62
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,049

是一千万
It's 10 million.

你会拿到文件的，如果钱
You'll get the file,
and if the money

65
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,096
在上午三点前没到帐的话
is not in the account
by 3:00 p.m.

66
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:31,031
我会找另外一个买家
I'll take it
to another buyer.

67
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,300
那我们怎么知道你会不会之前就卖了
How do we know
that you won't do that anyway?

68
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,542
你不会知道的
You don't.

69
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,554
先生，这边请
Here you are, sir.

00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,988
M16的事情怎么样了
So, how are things
at MI6?

75
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,117
跟往常一样，还不一样的官僚作风跟吓人的报酬
The usual. Same bureaucratic
bullshit and appalling remuneration.

76
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,287
这就是公务员的生活啊
Life of a government man.

77
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,421
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

看看吧

83
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,006

让你在这个世界上无处可逃的

我们的一些老上司看到这些文件公开
Some of our old bosses
aren't going to be happy

92
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,710
会不爽的
these files are out
in the open.

93
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,446
让你很紧张了？
Do I make you nervous?

94
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,782
一直都是这样。很好
Always.
Good.

95

wade:请听我说
Please, listen to me.

97
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,274
我跟这一点关系也没有
I had nothing to do
with this.

98
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,613
等等
Stop.

99
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,017

Let's go.

100
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,370
Wade : Tobin 你得相信我
Tobin, you have
to believe me.

101
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,999
对那我一无所知
I knew nothing
about any of that.

102
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,669
你知道有人跟踪你口马
Did you know if
anybody was following you?

103
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,873
不 我当然觉得有人在跟着我
No, I don't think

The guy is just not
going to prance

00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,016
你觉得我会让你就这样带我进去？
You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

404
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,583
我觉得你应该闭嘴
I think you need
to shut up.

405
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:53,486
我觉得你首先应该考虑一下你的藏匿之所是怎么受到袭击的
I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

406
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,549
你做过了吗 Matt ？
Have you done that, Matt?

407
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,132
他们跟着Kiefer，他们从领事馆就跟着他
They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate,

408
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,293
所以他们能找到藏身之所
and that's how they
found the safe house.

409
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,995
你不是真的相信我说的吧 是吧？
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

410
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:07,563
他们怎么能第一个知道我就在领事馆附近？
How did they know I was near the
consulate in the first place?

411
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:10,903
嗯
Hmm.

412
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,309
但是我喜欢 你知道 你和我 把这事儿搞个明白
But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

413
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,311
就像Hardy Bovs
Like the Hardy Boys.

414
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:21,446
那个藏匿之所位置很安全
That house was
a secure location.

415
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:22,888
那些摧毁它的人
Whoever crashed it

416
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:27,123
不会在加油站旁边停下来然后问最近的藏匿之所在哪儿
didn't stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house.

417
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:29,495
人们是被请过来的 有人告诉他们了Matthew
They were invited. Someone
told them, Matthew.

418
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:31,863
想想 想想你认识的人
Think about it.
Someone you know.

419
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:34,666
所以你最好问下你自己，你能相信你的房东吗
So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

420
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:36,568
接着说 你骗不了我的
Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

421
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:39,109
我已经给你洗脑了
I already am
in your head.

422
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,802
他们想要孤立你 Matt
They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

423
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,209
他们开始要真的对你好
They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

424
00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:45,010
他们胳膊抱着你像这样告诉你
They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like,

425
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:48,075
孩子 你的工作很体面 就从这儿结束吧
"You did a decent job, son.
We'll take it from here. "

426
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:49,586
那时候你就知道你被耍了
That's when you know
you're screwed.

427
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,649
忘了我 他们重点在你
Forget about me. They're
going to focus on you.

428
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:54,954
他们想试着将你跟我联系起来
They're going to try and make a
connection between you and I.

429
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,028
所以如果这些都是错的
So that if this
all goes wrong,

430
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:58,654
他们在参议院的听证会上
they'll have something
to fall back on

431
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,131
就有借口可说了
in their little
Senate hearings.

432
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,962
我并不是你今晚唯一的敌人
I'm not your
only enemy tonight.

433
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,011
Whitford：是藏匿之所里的某人
So, it's someone in-house.

434
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:13,274
这是这件事发生唯一可以解释的
It's the only way this
thing could've happened.

435
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:14,974
我们己经完全没辙了
We were
completely buttoned up.

436
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:19,217
我要一份知道这件事的所有人的名单
I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

437
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:20,778
背景 关系
Backgrounds, affiliations,

438
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:23,483
特别是跟Frost的联系
particularly any
connections with Frost.

439
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,118
到这事件发生前每一刻的事倩
Every movement right
up until this operation.

440
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:28,827
你的审讯小队 他们组织多长时间了，
Your extraction team, how
long had they been together?

441
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:32,734
我的小队组织起来有六个月了，为什么这么问？
My team had been together
six months. Why?

442
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,701
额 我只是试着把重心放在这
Well, I'm just trying to
get my head around this.

443
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:38,234
希望有用 谢谢
That will do, thank you.

444
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:27,994
嗨 嘿
Hello.
Hey.

445
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:30,129
宝贝 你在哪儿？
Baby, where are you?

446
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:32,099
我没事 我很好
I'm all right.
I'm okay.

447
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:34,193
很好
I'm okay.

448
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:38,734
对不起 没有回你电话 我看到未接来电了
I'm sorry I didn't call you
back, I saw your missed calls.

449
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,470
你肯定很担心
You must be worried sick.

450
00:42:40,532 --> 00:42:41,806
没事吧
Is everything okay?

451
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:45,616
我很好 没事 听着
I'm good.
I'm good. Listen.

452
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:47,310
听起来有点疯狂
This sounds so crazy.

453
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:49,813
昨晚诊所受到了点威胁
We had some threats against
the clinic last night,

454
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,082
所以parker和我  我们整夜都在那儿
so Parker and I,
we stayed all night

455
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:53,351
想试着弄清是怎么一回事儿
trying to get to
the bottom of it.

456
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,324
对不起没回你电话 我应该马上回的
And I'm sorry that I didn't cal! you back.
I should have, right away.

457
00:42:57,384 --> 00:42:58,920
我很担心你
I was so worried.

458
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:00,529
我知道
I know.

459
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:06,434
能帮我个忙么，你能走到窗前一会儿吗？
Can you do me a favor? Can you go
over to the window for a second?

460
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:07,598
为什么？
Why?

461
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:10,135
你能不能就往窗户外瞅一眼？
Can you just take a quick
look out the window?

462
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:12,270
我想让你看看是不是有人在外边
I want you to see if
there's anyone out there.

463
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,406
有没有你不认识的车，
Are there any cars
that don't belong?

464
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:16,312
有没有人在外边晃荡
Anyone hanging
around out front?

465
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,683
有一辆警车
There's a police car.

466
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:22,880
怎么了
What's going on?

467
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:23,981
对不起
I'm sorry about this.

468
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:25,287
我知道这很
I know this is a lot,

469
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:26,953
但是我们觉得最好
but we felt like
it would be best

470
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:28,553
不回家，为以防不测
if we didn't go home
as a precaution,

471
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,621
我同意了
and I agree with him.

472
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:31,428
我知道没什么可担心的 但是我同意了
I know there's nothing to worry
about, but I agree with him.

473
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,799
我觉得你应该去Dena家呆一阵子
I think you should just go to
Dena's for a little while,

474
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:36,702
就几个小时，我一会会打电话给你的
just for a few hours, and I'll
call you in a little bit.

475
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:40,137
我们会再一起的 好吗？
And we'll
get together, okay?

476
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,245
好的 我会去的
Okay, I'll go.

477
00:43:53,446 --> 00:43:55,926
好的 我爱你 一会再跟你说 好吗
Okay. I love you. I'll talk
to you soon, all right?

478
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:58,327
不要担心 没事的 再见
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

479
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,451
她知道你是干什么的？
She know what you do
for a living?

480
00:44:29,486 --> 00:44:32,956
电话那头那个女孩 是个女孩 是吧
The girl on the phone.
It was a girl, wasn't it?

481
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,135
或许是个男的 我不知道
Maybe it was a guy,
I don't know.

482
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:38,434
我不作评论
I don't judge.

483
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:47,477
Matthew,干我们这行的别希望跟谁有真正关系
You can't expect to have a real
relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

484
00:44:50,277 --> 00:44:51,415
不要担心 她会离开你的
Don't worry. She's not
going to leave you.

485
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:55,358
你试着说谎来保护她
See, what happens is, you try
to protect her with lies,

486
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:56,985
然后就越加一发不可收拾
and then it starts
to add up.

487
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:01,324
在藏匿之所你说他们会杀了你来得到你
At the safe house you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

488
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:02,868
一会儿后,甚至真相
After awhile,
even the truth...

489
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:05,200
为什么 开始听起来像个谎话了
Why?... starts to
sound like a lie.

490
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:08,701
是什么
You have something. You got something
that they want. What is it?

491
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:09,765
她是本地人吗
Is she a local?

492
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,867
不要担心她 是什么，
Don't worry about her.
What is it?

493
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:12,435
噢 是个女孩
Oh, it is a girl.

494
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:28,887
你会一直掩饰你的行为 她也会一直相信
You'll keep covering your
tracks, she'll keep believing.

495
00:45:28,953 --> 00:45:32,059
因为她想相信你 因为她需要相信你
Because she wants to,
because she needs to.

496
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:37,264
那就是我们的工作
That's why we exist, you
and me, that's our job.

497
00:45:38,296 --> 00:45:39,934
为了利用那些
To take advantage of that.

498
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:44,139
人们宁愿相信
People's desire
to believe.

499
00:45:44,804 --> 00:45:46,044
去信任
To trust.

500
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,054
她不会离开你的 Matthew
She's not going to
leave you, Matthew.

501
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,762
你会离开她的
You're going
to leave her.

502
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:10,902
我不是你
I'm not you.

503
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,663
男分析员：长官 是对的 我们证实了
Correct, sir.
We verified it.

504
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,150
那是你的人 你来
That is your boy.
You take it.

505
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:57,423
男分析员：大家待命
Everybody, stand by.

506
00:46:58,486 --> 00:47:00,090
Matty 是我
Matty, it's me.

507
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:02,456
怎么样了？
How are you holding up?

508
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:04,859
还行
I'm all right.

509
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:13,170
召集不了另一队人
Matt, we can't get another
team in for at least 12 hours.

510
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:15,674
对不起
Sorry.

511
00:47:16,939 --> 00:47:19,647
藏匿之所清空了
We've cleared a new safe house
for you outside the city.

512
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:21,455
256号寄物柜
There's a Go-Bag located

513
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:26,256
有个随行包
at locker number 256, Green Point
Stadium Metrorail station.

514
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:30,363
密码是25122
The combination
is 2-5-1-22.

515
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,899

2-5-1-22.

516
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:34,060
包里有个GpS
Now, the bag's
got a GPS in it.

517
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,570
会指引你去藏匿之所
It'll direct you
to the safe house.

518
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,738
那地点比较活跃
But you got to be careful,
it's an active location.

519
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:40,798
所以小心靠近
So, approach
with caution.

520
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,105
Matt 
Matt?

521
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:51,314
知道他们怎么找到Frost的
Do you know how
they found Frost?

522
00:47:51,378 --> 00:47:52,755
你知不知道是谁带着他们过来的？
Do you know who
led them to us?

523
00:47:55,815 --> 00:47:57,123
我们正在找呢
We're working on that.

524
00:47:58,051 --> 00:47:59,894
我们都指望你的Matt
We're counting
on you, Matt.

525
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:02,757
然后写下你自已的号码
Get Frost to that safe house and
you can write your own ticket.

526
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,166
我会的
I will.

527
00:48:08,797 --> 00:48:09,901
我会的
I will.

528
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:20,880
在灯那左转
Left at the light.

529
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:23,323
去体育馆？
To the stadium?

530
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:24,585
是的
Yeah.

531
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:50,079
围巾多少钱？
Hey, scarf.
How much for a scarf?

532
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:52,752
只要50兰特（100美分
Only fifty rand.

533
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:53,950
谢谢

know what he wanted from me.

558
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,338

584
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,202
你要杀了我吗？

to kill me?

585
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:30,244
我只杀职业的

00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:12,611
长官，Frost将会在开普敦做什么是我们的一大威胁
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost
might be doing in Cape Town.

591
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:16,143
你能放一下。。

592
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,155
Alec Wade十五年的奥委会军情六处

Sabotage, counter-ambush,
counter-IED tactics,

594
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,586
直到四年前在里斯本撕毁任择议定书
until he blew up an op
in Lisbon four years ago

595
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:27,153
并确凿无疑了
and was put on a desk,
pushing papers.

596
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,461
开普敦警方发现他被人爆头了
Cape Town Police found him
shot through the head,

597
00:57:29,523 --> 00:57:32,401
高功率步枪离领事馆有14个街区
high-powered rifle, 14
blocks from the consulate.

598
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,801
目击者所描述的很符合Frost的形象
Witnesses placed someone
fitting Frost's description

599
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:36,362
射击时在汽车里
in the car at the time
of the shooting.

600
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,840
所以我们猜测，什么？就是他们是一伙的？
And we think, what? That
they were working together?

601
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:41,809
他们联合离开在80年代在汉堡的行动

in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?

604
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:49,345
官方的，他们没说什么
Officially,
they're saying nothing.

605
00:57:49,406 --> 00:57:50,440
非官方的呢？
Unofficially?

606
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,783
他曾被进行过为期5个月的内部惆查
He's been the subject of a
five-month internal investigation.

607
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:54,549
他们怀疑他出售内部信息
They think he's
been trading intel.

608
00:57:54,612 --> 00:57:55,646
嗯
Hmm.

609
00:57:55,712 --> 00:57:57,850
那么Wade到底泄漏了些什么给Frost
So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frost

610
00:57:57,914 --> 00:58:01,087
这么重要以至于值得杀害我们6个同事
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men?

611
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:08,197
我要从军情六处得到更多的信息，所有你能得到的打进电话的账单
I want more details from MI6.

612
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:09,291

613
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:11,701
Daxid，我要对Daniel和他的小组
David, I want
an internal investigation

614
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:14,466
进行一次内部调查
into Daniel Kiefer
and his team.

615
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,639
我接到一个Weston打进给David Barlow的电话
I've got Weston calling in
for David Barlow.

616
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:05,946

00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:08,748
是的,他跑了
Yeah, he's gone.

619
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,311
在体育场。在我拿到Gps之后他就转移了
After I picked up the GPS,
he created a diversion,

620
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:13,084
还带走两个警察
took out a couple of cops
at the stadium.

621
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:14,523
Barlow：知道他要去哪吗？
Any idea
where he's headed?

622
00:59:14,582 --> 00:59:15,992
并不确定，但我可以猜到
Not exactly,
but I will.

623
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:18,426
我是linklater,你是说他带走了两个警察？
This is Linklater. You
said he took out two cops?

624
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:20,190
Matt,你继续说
Matt, you're on speaker.

625
00:59:21,754 --> 00:59:24,666
是的,长官,在绿点体育馆
Yes, ma'am.
At the Green Point Stadium.

626
00:59:24,723 --> 00:59:27,100
电视上女播音员：涉及到一个可能的绑架
...involvement

627
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:30,139
疑犯外貌为白种男性,中等身高
The suspect is being described
as a white male of medium build.

628
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:32,504
体育场的警察报告说你对一个警察开枪了
Stadium police is
reporting you shot a cop.

629
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:34,633
我是自卫反击
I returned fire
in self-defense.

630
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:37,634
实际上是Frost放松了戒备
The fact of the matter is,
Frost is on the loose.

631
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,780
我最后14个小时一直在跟着他
I've spent the last
14 hours with him.

632
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:42,180
他或许说了些和做了些让我能够找到他的蛛丝马迹
He might have said or done something
that could lead me to him.

633
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,913
你现在不要采取行动，现在就去领事馆
You are to stand down,
proceed to the consulate,

634
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:48,285

and present yourself for exfil and debrief.
Acknowledge.

635
00:59:48,478 --> 00:59:50,821
在我汇报情况的时候，Frost就已经跑了
By the time I'm debriefed,
Frost will be gone.

636
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,381
我花了一年的时间调查这
I've spent 12
months researching

637
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:53,653
镇上的每个角落

638
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,423
我会找到Frost的，会把他带回来的
I will find Frost
and I'll deliver him.

639
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:58,930

Weston, this is

Now, you've done a fine job,
but we'll take it from here.

641
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:12,505

644
01:00:36,186 --> 01:00:37,562
不要把这些记录在案
that exchange not
make it onto his files.

645
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,097
他既没有不称职也没为其他人工作
He's either incompetent or he's
working with somebody else.

646
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:41,657
不牵扯到Weston
Do not make this
about Weston.

647
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:43,234
是你的人弄丢了 Frost
It was your guys
that lost Frost.

648
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:44,999
是你的小组在安全屋里把这弄砸的
It was your team that
folded at the safe house.

Frost is trying to get out of the country.
Go find his ass.

651
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:26,769
找到你了，小东西

Weston
Police had detained
American NGO worker Matthew Weston

655
01:02:23,713 --> 01:02:26,454
他可能牵扯到枪击事件

像一个黑色的Dorian Gray

ILLANA：喝茶吗？
May I offer you some tea?

721
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:55,443
不用，我们去楼上
No, we're going
upstairs.

722
01:08:08,082 --> 01:08:09,560
我记得
I remembered.

723
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,130
你甚至可以让它呼吸．
You even let it breathe.

724

太长时间的牺牲会使一个人变得铁石心肠
"Too long a sacrifice Can
make a stone of the heart

725
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,136
哦，什么时候它会满足？
"O when may it suffice?

726
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:30,442
那是天堂的一块

以前的时候，一瓶便宜的

人是不会变的

我们老了
We grow old.

733
01:08:57,492 --> 01:08:59,903
我们中的一些开始慢慢适应
And some of us adapt.

734
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:03,764
和学会怎么享受这平淡生活的快乐
And learn how to enjoy
simple pleasures of life,

735
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:08,005
就如一个家庭，一个家

736
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:10,408
至于你...

你的那杯你现在装着些什么
What's in that glass
right now, for you,

738

因为它永远是一样好
is as good as it's
ever going to be.

739
01:09:18,276 --> 01:09:21,381
总有一天你会明白的
One day you'll understand.

740
01:09:21,446 --> 01:09:25,018
你对过去挂念太多啊
You got more past
than future, you learn.

741
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:28,752
这是什么？一种接入器？
What is this?
An intervention?

742
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,570
我以为你已经死了

743

那么，在这么多年后
So, what brings you to my home
in the middle of the night

744
01:09:53,641 --> 01:09:55,119

745
01:10:09,722 --> 01:10:10,893
哦哦

746
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,029

嗯呢
Uh-huh.

748
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,041
我们要走了
We're going.

749
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:22,636
好的，路上注意
Okay, be careful.

750
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:24,200
知道了爸爸
Okay, Papa

751
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,760
你要怎么处理这些？

赚些钱

753

让我用下你的眼镜

这就是了，听着

我需要一个新的护照，身份证还有驾照
I'm going to need a new passport,
photo ID, driver's license,

756
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:06,005
全部的这些家当，你能帮我办到吗？
the whole shebang.
Can you do that for me?

757
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:08,275
当然
Yeah.

758
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:11,343
你确定？
You sure?

759
01:11:12,543 --> 01:11:13,612
嗯

760

Weston从未在领事馆露过面

showed at the consulate.

761

他刚刚访问我们的安全服务器

accessing our secure server,

762
01:11:25,522 --> 01:11:28,331
寻找一个人，以创建一个别名包。

leave the country.

764

或许他在跟着Frost

after Frost.

765
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,407
瞧瞧在足球体育场发生了些什么

happened at the soccer stadium.

766

这家伙让Frost逃跑了

let Frost escape.

767
01:11:44,204 --> 01:11:46,183
我想Weston叛敌了

768

你并没有看见证据

seeing the evidence.

773

这不是我最好的成绩

774
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:15,973
但是出于时间的压力，还行吧
But given the pressure
of time, it's passable.

775
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,141
一旦我出城了
It's good.
I'll wire you the money

776
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,645
还行，钱我会电汇给你的

I get out of town.

777
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:24,275
Tobin,不这这么干，这不一样
Tobin, don't do this.
It's different.

778

你不需要金钱

953
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:30,534
文件？
The file?

954
01:37:32,328 --> 01:37:34,170
你们要找的文件
The file that you're on.

955
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:41,274
关系到其它很多人
Along with a lot
of other people.

956
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:43,073
很重要的人
Important people.

957
01:37:55,414 --> 01:37:56,448
Barlow:听我说
Listen to me.

958
01:37:57,383 --> 01:37:59,658
如果有人监视你的一举一动
What would you do

959
01:37:59,718 --> 01:38:02,357
你会怎么办？
if someone is
watching your every move?

960
01:38:03,655 --> 01:38:06,430
你也许并不以有些人为荣
Some maybe
you're not proud of.

961
01:38:06,491 --> 01:38:09,960
但是相信我，一定会有一些你并以之为傲的人
And you will have some you're
not proud of, believe me.

962
01:38:10,027 --> 01:38:12,563
然后以之来对付你？
And then tries to
use it against you?

963
01:38:15,164 --> 01:38:17,336
有些事你会不得不做的
You would do
what you have to do.

964
01:38:18,201 --> 01:38:20,612
有些事你会不得不做的
You would do
what you have to do.

965
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,214
文件在哪？
Where's the file?

966
01:38:36,951 --> 01:38:40,056
文件在哪？
Matt, the file.
Where is the file?

967
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:44,098
你去死吧
You're a dead man.

968
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:46,436
是的，还早呢
Yeah, a long time now.

969
01:38:46,693 --> 01:38:48,365
Frost在这儿
Frost is here.

970
01:40:51,135 --> 01:40:52,477
我们走
Let's go.

971
01:41:15,389 --> 01:41:16,992
我们抓到他了
We got him.

972
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,431
妈的什么工作
A hell of a job.

973
01:41:55,925 --> 01:41:57,335
你闻到了吗？
You smell that?

974
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,601
很好的酒
Pinotage. It's a good grape.
Great wine.

975
01:42:00,663 --> 01:42:04,701
Pinogage酒很.....
Local grape.
Pinotage is great...

976
01:42:12,372 --> 01:42:14,783
我不想你把这个弄丢了
I don't want you
losing this one.

977
01:42:15,342 --> 01:42:18,254
它很值钱
It's worth a lot
of money.

978
01:42:21,547 --> 01:42:24,026
你是个好孩子,Matty
You're a good boy,
Matty.

979
01:42:26,385 --> 01:42:28,057
你知道你是什么样的人
You know what you are.

980
01:42:31,423 --> 01:42:32,765
嘿
Hey.

981
01:42:33,758 --> 01:42:35,668
我知道你不是那样的人
I know what you're not.

982
01:42:39,864 --> 01:42:42,036
你比我好多了
You're better than me.

983
01:42:45,835 --> 01:42:50,579
只要比我好就行
No, it's okay,
just be better than me.

984
01:42:55,277 --> 01:42:57,017
答应我
You promise me.

985
01:42:58,447 --> 01:42:59,720
好的
Yeah.

986
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:07,628
额，我们...
Well, let's...

987
01:43:09,956 --> 01:43:11,662
走
Let's go.

988
01:43:13,059 --> 01:43:16,562
我必须起来，我必须起来
I just got to get up.
I need to get up.

989
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:19,866
坐着
Stay.

990
01:43:22,635 --> 01:43:23,806
坐着
Stay.

991
01:43:26,905 --> 01:43:28,144
嘿
Hey...

992
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:48,043
这就是所发生的详细的一切
That's exactly
as it happened.

993
01:44:52,714 --> 01:44:54,454
很明显，这种情况需要
Obviously,
this situation needs

994
01:44:54,514 --> 01:44:56,754
特殊手段才能处理
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse.

995
01:44:57,251 --> 01:44:58,923
还有其它人看过这份报告吗？
Has anybody else
seen this report?

996
01:44:58,986 --> 01:45:00,896
没有，长官，还没有
No, sir. Not yet.

997
01:45:02,221 --> 01:45:03,858
Matt，我肯定这事不出意料
Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,

998
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:08,598
这份报告里一些东西要被修饰一下
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security.

999
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,372
哪些，长官？
Which parts, sir?

1000
01:45:11,429 --> 01:45:12,839
额..
Well...

1001
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:15,501
David Barlow不能对所发生的
David Barlow can't
be held responsible

1002
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:17,443
担负责任，比如藏匿之所
for what happened
to the safe house.

1003
01:45:18,269 --> 01:45:20,874
我们不需要丑闻
We just don't
need the scandal.

1004
01:45:20,938 --> 01:45:23,440
那不是事实
But, sir, you and I both know
that, that is just not the truth.

1005
01:45:23,507 --> 01:45:26,112
人们不再需要事实了Matt
People don't want
the truth anymore, Matt.

1006
01:45:26,175 --> 01:45:29,087
这太糟糕了，让他们永埋地下吧
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

1007
01:45:33,316 --> 01:45:35,625
但是我告诉你我想做的
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

1008
01:45:36,451 --> 01:45:39,556
我觉得局里太低估你了
I think the Agency has
grossly underestimated you,

1009
01:45:39,621 --> 01:45:43,762
我会推荐你一个高级案件主管的职位的
and I'm recommending you for a
senior case officer position.

1010
01:45:43,824 --> 01:45:45,325
提供你仍然想要的
Provided you still want it.

1011
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,899
那真是一个慷慨的建议，长官
That's a generous
offer, sir.

1012
01:45:49,996 --> 01:45:53,738
只有一件事你需要清楚
There's just one thing you
need to clarify for me.

1013
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,107
当然
Of course.

1014
01:45:56,169 --> 01:45:59,206
Frost可能给一些很重要的情报
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

1015
01:45:59,271 --> 01:46:00,613
一份文件
A file.

1016
01:46:01,173 --> 01:46:04,051
但我在这报告里任何地方都没有看到
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

1017
01:46:11,482 --> 01:46:13,290
文件里是什么，长官？
What was
on the file, sir?

1018
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:16,092
坦率的说是一些很有毁灭性的东西
Something that, quite frankly,
could be very damaging

1019
01:46:16,153 --> 01:46:18,496
对这个部门，对我们的盟友来说
to the Agency
and to our allies.

1020
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:25,799
我不明白为什么Frost甚至对我提都没提这事
I don't see why Frost would even
mention something like that to me.

1021
01:46:31,032 --> 01:46:33,477
不，我认为他不会，是吧？
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

1022
01:46:37,839 --> 01:46:41,115
但是你知道如果文件内容泄露的话
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,

1023
01:46:42,643 --> 01:46:44,781
会怎样吧？
what would happen
to the person responsible?

1024
01:46:44,845 --> 01:46:46,846
它会被逮捕，长官
That person would
be arrested, sir.

1025
01:46:46,913 --> 01:46:48,755
他在冒很大的危险
He'd be risking
everything.

1026
01:46:49,782 --> 01:46:53,593
他会在全世界的情报部门全面树敌
He'd have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world.

1027
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:58,792
在CIA眼里,他就像是Tobin Frost
In the eyes of the CIA he'd
be just like Tobin Frost.

1028
01:47:02,594 --> 01:47:05,540
关于文件Frost什么也没说,长官
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

1029
01:47:10,768 --> 01:47:12,110
好吧，孩子
All right, son.

1030
01:47:13,236 --> 01:47:14,839
休息几天
Take a few days off.

1031
01:47:14,904 --> 01:47:16,883
下周开始工作
We'll get you
started next week.

1032
01:47:18,708 --> 01:47:20,050
谢谢
Thank you.

1033
01:47:22,244 --> 01:47:25,224
想想我们的谈话，好吧？
And think about our
conversation, would you?

1034
01:47:25,481 --> 01:47:26,982
我会的
Will do.

1035
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:29,026
从现在开始我就会的，长官
I'll take it
from here, sir.

1036
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:55,842
其他媒体..
...and other media outlets

1037
01:47:55,903 --> 01:47:58,742
从一个未知来源接收到一个谈话文件
received a controversial file
from an anonymous source.

1038
01:47:58,935 --> 01:48:00,707
国际情报团体仍然
The international intelligence
community is still reeling

1039
01:48:00,768 --> 01:48:03,801
高度机密文件
from the release of so many
highly classified documents

1040
01:48:03,866 --> 01:48:07,365
以及广布的腐败和犯罪活动信息
and the revelations of widespread
corruption and criminal activity

1041
01:48:07,431 --> 01:48:08,464
的泄露头晕目胜
at the CIA,
the BND, and MI6.

1042
01:48:08,531 --> 01:48:09,667
报道1：由于英国情报机构
...is in
an uproar over the lack

1043
01:48:09,731 --> 01:48:11,639
的疏忽引起轩然大波
of oversight given to
British Intelligence,

1044
01:48:11,696 --> 01:48:14,036
要求交出负有此责任的探员
demanding accountability
of the rogue agents.

1045
01:48:14,096 --> 01:48:15,902
MI6的官员正在全面合作
Officials at MI6
are fully cooperating.

1046
01:48:15,961 --> 01:48:17,494
报道2 : Merkel总理承认
Chancellor
Merkel insists that the BND

1047
01:48:17,561 --> 01:48:19,435
已经确认了腐败探员
has already identified
the corrupt agents

1048
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:21,299
包括情报特工
and contained
the intelligence breach.

1049
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,961
她已经保证国际同仁
She has ensured her
international counterparts...

1050
01:48:23,025 --> 01:48:25,059
报道3：起诉将在本周进行
Indictments are
now expected within the week,

1051
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:27,657
国会要求副主任Harlan Whltford
and Congress has demanded that
Deputy Director Harlan Whitford

1052
01:48:27,723 --> 01:48:29,666

testify before
a Senate subcommittee

1053
01:48:29,723 --> 01:48:31,427
决定多少CIA人员
