人们在庆祝菲利普斯先生的成功

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
要我迟一点再来吗?

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,690
有话直说吧
Speak your mind.

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,430
教堂唱圣歌时 
Phillips' gang

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,440
菲利普斯那帮子人突然闯了进来
raided services at the tug fork church,

61
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,110
抓走了汤姆・钱伯斯和马洪兄弟

还蛮横无理地打了加勒特牧师一拳
smacked preacher Garrett for no apparent reason.

63
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,810
昂斯 他们可是打了我们一巴掌

Any word from your man John B. Floyd?

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,260
文迪州长简直垃圾不如
Governor Windy ain't doing shit,

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,370
整天只听信律师们的谗言

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,700
毫不理会那些纽约的耙粪记者们
and getting his back up against these New York muckrakers

69
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,770
把我们称作为"野人山部落"
calling us a "Savage Mountain Tribe."

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,280
我们得依靠自己 向来如此
It's up to us, like always.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,950
你有什么打算?
What do you propose?

72
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,350
擒贼先擒王
Cut off the head of the snake.

73
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,600
要想抓住弗兰克・菲利普斯是非常困难的
Be awful treacherous going after Frank Phillips.

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,470
他身边有一个军队跟着呢

不 他是...他只是爪牙

76
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,410
我们得杀了兰德尔・麦考伊
We ought to kill Randall McCoy.

77
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,520
先生 我是佩里・克莱因律师

我将代表你们 除非法庭认为有必要
I'll represent you till the court deems it necessary

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,560
委任一位公设辩护人
to appoint a public defender.

80
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,060
难道留着你做我们的律师
You think we got a better chance

81
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,690
我们会有更大的机会胜诉吗?
if we keep you on as our lawyer?

82
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,730
这要取决于你们
Well, it's up to you.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,670
我比谁都要了解这案子的情况
I do know the circumstances of the case better than anyone.

84
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,610
这些邮资信封是用来联系你们家人的
Now, these stamped envelopes are to contact your family members

85
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,940
让他们知道你们没被亏待
to assure them you're being well-treated

86
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,510
还有准备好给我的聘请定金

你们杀了我的儿子们

89
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,690
你那些杀人犯儿子
Your murdering sons.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
定罪之前任何人都是无罪的
Not guilty till proved innocent,

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,790
像你这样的人也理应得到公平审判
men like you who deserved a fair trial.

92
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,260
我祈祷你被绞死
I pray you hang.

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,600
我会提供造绞刑架的木材

我还会帮你系紧绞绳的结

因为你将被不灭的地狱之火所焚烧!
as you are sent to boil in eternal damnation's hellfire!

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,550
也祝你圣诞快乐 先生
A Merry Christmas to you, too, sir.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,700

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,670
听见什么?

101
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,240
嘘
Shh.

102
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,280
他们会从那边来
They'll come from over there.

103
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,250
谁?
Who will?

104
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,650
哈特菲尔德家的人 他们会从那边来
Hatfields, they'll come from over there.

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
哈特菲尔德家的人?

106
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,490
妈 哈特菲尔德家的人正躲着恶人弗兰克呢
Ma, Hatfields are hiding out from bad Frank.

107
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,460
他们不会过来河这边的
They ain't gonna come across this side of the river.

108
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,660
进去吧 好吗?
Let's go inside, huh?

109

今晚没有人会来
No one's coming tonight.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,530
我不是说今晚
It's not tonight I speak of.

111
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,770
我们就像猎物一样被那些该死的赏金猎人追捕
We're hunted like animals by hired trash.

112
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,410
家人和朋友 或被绑架 或被谋杀
Family and friends kidnapped and murdered.

113
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,150
法律袖手旁观
The law stood by.

114
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,120
法律无所作为
The law has done nothing.

115
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,750
尽管如此 如果有什么....
Even so, if there was anything...

116
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,990
我可以付出什么
anything I had that, by giving it,

117
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,560
来结束这场血腥争斗
I could end this bloody struggle,

118
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
我会心甘情愿地付出
I would give it gladly.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,400
我愿意献出我的生命来终止这场战争
I'd give my life if it would end this.

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,410
你不会的
You would not.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,040
我不愿意献出的是
What I will not give

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,580
我族人的哪怕一滴血
is one more drop of this family's blood.

123
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,760
所以今晚
So tonight,

124
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,160
在这新年前夕
this new year's Eve,

125
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,060
让我们了结这一切吧
we end this forever.

126
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,570
我愿意和你一起去 哈特菲尔德先生
Im's with you, Mr. Hatfield.

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,940
你不能跟着来 比利
You ain't coming, Billy.

128
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,370
你仍未准备好
You ain't ready.

129
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,110
感谢星星 我没来得太晚吧
Thank the stars I ain't too late.

130
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,110
有的是时间 约翰斯
Lots of time, Johnse.

131
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,420
我们正等着你爸爸咳完呢
We all just waiting for your pa to finish his coughing fit.

132
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,230
我们可以在黎明时分到达那里
We can be there by dawn,

133
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,230
让太阳照耀着我们的后背前行
make our approach with the sun at our backs.

134
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,200
早晨来临
The time of the morning,

135
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,170
那时他们一定毫无防备
the day it is, they won't expect nothing.

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,770
我们无需伤害其他人
We harm no one we don't have to.

137
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,840
一旦兰德尔看清局势
Once Randall sees how it is,

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,450
他会为了保护其他人而主动投降
he'll surrender himself to protect the others from harm.

139
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,480
我们生擒他
We take him alive.

140
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,890
我觉得我们该干掉他
Thought we was getting rid of him.

141
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,690
一旦兰德尔・麦考伊被捉获
Once Randall McCoy's extradited,

142
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,690
成为我们的战俘 我们...
as our prisoner of war, we...

143
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,700
我们在西弗吉尼亚州处决他
we execute him here in West Virginia,

144
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,060
他在哪犯下的罪行
the state where he committed his crimes.

145
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,740
就该在哪被处决
As is proper.

146
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,480
有点头晕
A mite dizzy.

147
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,210
不小心踩在了石头上了
Stepped on a stone or something.

148
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,780
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

149
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,590
我们还是要送你去医生那里
We still got to get you to the doc.

150
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,090
不 没有时间了
No, there's no time.

151
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,390
爸爸 你太虚弱了
You're too sick, pa.

152
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,060
就这样办吧
Well, we can do this.

153
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,960
该死的
Damn.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,530
昂斯
Anse.

155
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,240
要是你一直这样咳嗽而暴露了我们的行踪
Be a worthless trip if you start coughing like that

156
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,210
这趟就白去了
and give us all away.

157
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,980
只要毫发无损地带兰德尔一人回来即可
No one but Randall taken and him not harmed.

158
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,220
毫发无损的
Him not harmed,

159
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,120
否则你给我一个交代
or you answer to me.

160
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
好的 全部出发
All right, y'all.

161
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,160
上马
Saddle up.

162
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,330
你会好起来的 昂斯
You're gonna beat it, Anse.

163
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,960
我们会抓到兰德尔的
And we'll get Randall.

164
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,020
兰德尔 醒醒
Randall, wake up.

165
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,360
他们来了
They're here.

166
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,530
嘘
Shh.

167
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,070
怎么了 爸爸?
What is it, poppy?

168
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,980
快让孩子们下来
Get them children down.

169
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,440
快下来
Get down.

170
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,680
走
Go.

171
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,190
地狱即是我的天堂
May hell be my heaven,

172
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,060
谁要是违抗我的命令擅自开枪
I will kill any man who goes back on me

173
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,690
我就杀了他
if powder will burn.

174
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,600
好吧 按计划行事 各自就位
All right, as planned. Go on now.

175
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,870
就位
Go on.

176
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,940
爸爸说只抓兰德尔
You know, pa said just Randall.

177
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,340
我们得把他带回西弗吉尼亚州
We take him back over the tug to West Virginia

178
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,480
你觉得兰德尔・麦考伊
You think Randall McCoy's gonna let himself

179
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,480
会举手投降吗?
get took alive?

180
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,450
至少得试一试
We got to try.

181
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,580
兰德尔・麦考伊!
Randall McCoy!

182
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,190
你的死期到了
Your final day has dawned.

183
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,190
想要救你家人一命的话
Save your family.

184
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,160
就快点投降吧
Surrender yourself.

185
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,860
听到了吗?
You hear me?

186
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,530
你的死期到了
Your final day has dawned.

187
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
吉姆叔叔!
Uncle Jim!

188
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,080
吉姆
Jim.

189
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,980
这里已经被我们包围了
We got all sides covered now,

190
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,850
每一扇门 每一扇窗 每一个鼠穴
every door, window, and rathole.

191
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
他们休想从我们眼皮子底下溜走
Ain't nobody gonna get out without us seeing them.

192
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
谁负责后面?
Who's got the back?

193
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,750
淡毛科顿
Cotton Top.

194
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,750
Cotton Top表示有极淡色头发的人 以下译成"淡毛科顿"

195
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,360
约翰斯和他一起
Johnse's with him.

196
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,190
我去确认一下
I'll go check them out.

197
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,800
你的农场已经被我们包围了 麦考伊
We got your whole farm surrounded, McCoy.

198
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,970
你最好快点出来
Might as well come on out.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,940
立刻投降 我们就会放过你的家人!
Do it now, and we spare your family!

200
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,470
我看到吉姆・万斯了
I seen that Jim Vance.

201
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,870
盖・哈特菲尔德还有其他人
Cap Hatfield and the others

202
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,880
应该都埋伏起来了
are out of sight taking cover.

203
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,010
多少人?
How many?

204
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,840
十五个 也许更多
15, probably more.

205
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,710
过来
Come on.

206
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,780
快过来
Come on.

207
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,920
躲在后面 坐下来
Get behind and sit.

208
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,280
你也是
You too.

209
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,620
不要轻举妄动 除非他们先开枪
Don't shoot unless they do

210
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,790
或者有人冲过来
or someone charges.

211
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,020
不管怎么样 我都打不中他们的
I can't get a good shot no ways.

212
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,610
嘘
Shh.

213
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,210
嘘
Shh.

214
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,210
抱歉
Sorry.

215
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,250
这个调子一直在我脑海里回响
I got this tune stuck in my head.

216
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,580
约翰斯去哪了?
Where's Johnse?

217
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,380
我只知道他要我守住后面
He said to watch the back is all I know.

218
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,050
不要让任何人出来
Don't let no one out.

219
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,650
守住这里
Watch the back.

220
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,430
兰德尔・麦考伊 出来投降面对现实吧
Randall McCoy, come on out and face the day,

221
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,460
否则的话 我就把你的房子烧掉
or else I have to burn your house down.

222
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,070
你希望你的孩子们被活活烧死吗?
You want your little ones consumed in fire?

223
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,010
我们很好 不要担心
We're all right. Don't worry.

224
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,310
你希望听到他们的小身躯
Their wee bodies a-hissing

225
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,580
被火炙烤发出嘶嘶声吗?
and a-steaming?

226
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,650
兰德尔!
Randall!

227
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
从后面逃出去 然后向树林方向跑
Go out the back, and run for the woods.

228
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,120
我必须出去
I got to go out there.

229
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,590
我现在出去和吉姆・万斯最后摊牌的话
If I can get a showdown with Jim Vance,

230
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,220
或许其他人就会退缩
maybe the others will back down.

231
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,090
兰德尔他会毫不留情地杀死你的
Randall, he'll shoot you down like you was nothing.

232
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,690
我求求你了 丈夫
I'm begging you, husband,

233
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,130
趁着现在赶紧从后门溜出去
slip out the back while you can.

234
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,330
如果知道你逃走了 他们就会放了我们的
If they know you're gone, they'll leave us be.

235
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,120
淡毛科顿 那是什么?
Cotton Top, what's that?

236
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,260
停止射击!
Hold your fire!

237
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,900
趴下! 趴下!
Get down! Get down!

238
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,700
停火!
Hold on!

239
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,930
该死的!
God damn it!

240
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,730
我还没有下命令!
I didn't order yet!

241
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,140
停火!
Hold on!

242
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,240
我再说一次 停止射击!
I said, hold your fire!

243
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,440
他妈的怎么回事?
What the hell?

244
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,840
科顿先开枪的
Cotton started shooting.

245
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,610
肯定是看到麦考伊探头探脑了
Must have seen McCoy stick his head out.

246
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,750
快去看看
Go find out.

247
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,120
嘿 爸爸不在这里!
Hey, my pa's not here!

248
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,790
他昨晚在派克维尔过夜的!
He stayed over in Pikeville last night!

249
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,320
我说让他出来!
I said for him to come out!

250
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,760
他不在这里!
He's not here!

251
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,690
除了我以外
Ain't nobody in here but me,

252
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,630
就只有些女人和孩子了
except women and childrens.

253
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,630
兰德尔!
Randall!

254
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,230
我们就在这里一直等到你出来为止
We're all waiting for you.

255
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,270
他不在这里!
He's not here!

256
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,580
天父啊 请救救我的家人
Heavenly father, spare my family,

257
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,310
消灭我的敌人
and smite my enemy.

258
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,580
我祈求你 看在我们无助的份上
I beg of you, have mercy in our hour of need.

259
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,650
祈求你的怜恤 主耶稣
Have mercy, lord Jesus.

260
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,290
他
He

261
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,540
科顿 我们说过 
cotton, we said,

262
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,520
"不要让任何人从后面出来"
"Let nobody out the back."

263
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,360
不要让任何人从后面出来!
Nobody out the back!

264
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,060
抱歉
Sorry.

265
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,200
抱歉
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,200
只能来硬的了
Discourtesy is what it is.

267
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,420
狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

268
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,390
我们必须把火扑灭 快拿水
We got to get the fires out. We need more water.

269
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,990
用牛奶
Use the buttermilk.

270
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,790
你个没种的 竟然连女人和孩子都不放过!
You're burning women and children, you coward!

271
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,190
你就是个魔鬼 吉姆・万斯
What kind of devil are you, Jim Vance?

272
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,230
爱丽菲尔!
Alifair!

273
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,900
听我说
Now, you listen to me.

274
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,240
带着妈妈和弟弟妹妹从后面溜出去  好吗?
You get ma and the kids out the back, all right?

275
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,840
妈妈 快点 我们快走

277
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,840
照顾好弟弟妹妹们 爱丽菲尔
Mind the babies, Alifair.

278
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,780
我随后就来
I'll be along.

279
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,650
妈妈 快走 快 快!
Ma. Go, go, go!

280
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,520

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,750
你们应该待在里面的
You got to go back inside.

284
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,660
- 快走 - 快回去!
- Keep going. - Get back inside!

285
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,590
不可以这样
It ain't allowed.

286
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,200
我让他们...我让他们从后面溜出去了
I let them... I let them out the back.

287
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,310
你打死一个
You got one.

288
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,510
干得不错
That's good enough.

289
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,850
他们不可以这样
They ain't allowed.

290
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,220
快把兰德尔・麦考伊交出来!
 I want Randall McCoy!

291
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,130
我这就把他儿子交给你!
Well, you got his son!

292
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,340
爸爸
Poppy.

293
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,270
爸爸
Poppy.

294
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,540
嘿
Hey.

295
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,080
范妮
Fanny.

296
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,380
妈妈呢?
Where's your mother?

297
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,180
爱丽菲尔受伤了
Alifair got hurt.

298
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,260
停止射击
Hold your fire.

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,740
你他妈在做什么?
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,020
愚蠢的疯婆子
Crazy stupid bitch.

301
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,420
血仇

302
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,400
我做了一个梦
I was having a dream,

303
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,240
梦中 莎莉 说 "他们来了"
and Sally said, "They're here."

304
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,540
我听到吉姆・万斯叫嚣着
I heard Jim Vance yelling,

305
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,450
"兰德尔・麦考伊 快出来受死吧!"
"Randall McCoy, come out and face the day!"

306
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,480
然后他们就对我穷追不舍
And it was me they was after.

307
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,880
你可以把头往后面仰一点吗?
Can you lean your head back?

308
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,280
我得检查一下你的眼睛
I need to look in your eye.

309
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,680
我告诉莎莉 "我必须出去"
I told Sally, "I got to go out there."

310
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
她说 "如果你出去的话 他们会杀死你的"
She said, "You do, they'll kill you.

311
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,460
"快从后面逃出去"
"Try and get out the back."

312
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,400
"如果你逃出去 我和孩子们就安全了"
"Me and the children, we'll be safe when you're gone."

313
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,230
安全了
Safe.

314
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,530
一切都会没事的
It's gonna be all right.

315
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,370
- 我要我的罗西 - 我知道 亲爱的
- I want my Rosie. - I know, sweetheart.

316
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,870
我匆匆向树林里面跑去
I lit out and made for the woods.

317
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,440
接着我听到枪声
Then I heard the shooting.

318
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,350
不一会 我就看到浓烟滚滚
After a while, I seen the smoke.

319
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,250
我看到了我的孩子们
Then I saw the children.

320
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,320
孩子们告诉我 
The children told me

321
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,820
爱丽菲尔带着他们从火场逃出来的时候
Alifair was leading them away from the fire

322
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,830
被他们打中了
when they shot her.

323
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,760
我把他们带进树林深处
I took them deeper in the woods.

324
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,730
我们跪下向上帝祈祷
We knelt, and we prayed.

325
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,070
当我回去的时候 他们已经走了
When I got back, they was gone.

326
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,070
房子着火了
The house was on fire

327
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,670
我看见恶魔在烈火之中
I see the devil in the fire

328
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,070
他踱着步
He was walking aroud

329
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,070
嘲笑我
Laughed at me

330
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,750
菲利普斯先生
Mr. Phillips.

331
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,590
你得来看看这个
You got to see this.

332
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,690
莎莉就躺在卡尔文不远处
Sally was laying on the ground next to Calvin.

333
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,560
我把她扶起来 挽着她的胳膊
I picked her up, and I held her in my arms

334
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,300
不知道过了多长时间
for I don't know how long.

335
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,730
当我再次抬头的时候
And when I next looked up,

336
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,100
你就出现在我面前
you was here.

337
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,940
你儿子吉姆正在来接孩子的路上
Your son Jim is on his way to get the kids.

338
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,940
你和麦考伊小姐可以待在我那里
You and Miss McCoy will stay at my house.

339
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,350
我向仁慈的上帝祈祷 但他对我却毫无怜悯
I prayed to a merciful God who showed us no mercy.

340
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,320
兰德尔 我们要成就上帝的意愿
His will, Randall, not our, will be done.

341
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,750
这是他的意愿吗?
This is his will?

342
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,130
我的孩子死了 我的妻子受伤了 
My children dead, my wife hurt,

343
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,690
我的房子毁了?
and my house burned?

344
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,360
上帝在哪?
Where was God?

345
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,860
如果这是他的意愿 那这算哪门子上帝?
If this is his will, what kind of God is that?

346
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,370
哪门子上帝?
What kind of God is that?

347
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,470
是麦考伊家的另一个女儿
It's the other McCoy girl.

348
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,170
看上去她已经死了
Looks like she's seen the devil.

349
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,010
不管我们现在想怎么做
Whatever we want now.

350
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,380
规则已经定好了
Rules are done.

351
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,570
你好 查尔斯
Hey, Charles.

352
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,570
怎么样了?
What?

353
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,790
看着一家人安安静静地吃饭
You know, looking at this family peacefully feeding

354
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,290
让我感慨 我们为什么要杀麦考伊家的人
reminds a body of why we kill McCoys.

355
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,400
坐下 坐下
Sit down. Sit down.

356
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,940
进行得并不顺利
It didn't turn out so well.

357
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,780
告诉我
Tell me.

358
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,310
那个该死的弱智科顿
That goddamn half-wit cotton turd.

359
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,150
这话可能在孩子们面前说不合适
Oh, this probably ain't fit for the ears of young 'uns.

360
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,960
去洗洗
Go wash.

361
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,160
带上你弟弟 快去
Take your brothers. Let's go.

362
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,590
走吧 顺便关上门
Go. Shut the door behind you.

363
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,330
快说吧
Just say it.

364
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:18,140
他的家人们妨碍了
Our foray against old Randall was interfered with

365
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,680
我们对老兰德尔的偷袭
by family members.

366
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,880
老兰德尔像只受惊的兔子似的逃跑了
While old Randall was running scared like a jackrabbit,

367
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,550
他的儿子卡尔文...
his heir Calvin...

368
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,590
抱着必死的决心
Come charging us,

369
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,260
冲出来迎战我们
shooting with deadly intent.

370
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,530
我除了杀他 别无选择
I had no choice but to kill him.

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,500
你说"家人"
You said "family."

372
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,070
嗯
Ah.

373
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:54,140
兰德尔的一个年岁稍大的女儿 嗯...
One of old Randall's older daughters, um...

374
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,840
她在逃跑的时候被误杀
She got in the way and got killed accidental.

375
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,950
被误杀的可能还不止她一个
There may have been others.

376
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,290
我们试图用火把他们逼出来
We tried to burn them out.

377
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,430
这些都是我们预料不到的 昂斯
And all unforeseen, Anse.

378
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,530
但是你了解你儿子盖 对吧?
But you know your boy, Cap?

379
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,900
他现在做的很好
He done good now.

380
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,270
所以兰德尔逃跑了
And Randall got away.

381
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
是的
Yup.

382
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,870
那兰德尔的妻子呢?
And what of Randall's wife?

383
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,480
她穿着睡衣跑出来
She run mad, barreled straight at me

384
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,450
发了疯似的拿枪指着我
in her dishabille.

385
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,620
然后呢?
And?

386
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,360
然后我...
And I...

387
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,890
我用我的枪托
I laid her in the back of the ear

388
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,160
把她砸晕在地
with my rifle butt.

389
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,570
现在应该已经死了
I believe she's done.

390
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,170
我们现在怎么办 吉姆?
What we do now, Jim?

391
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,180
把他们全杀了?
Kill them all?

392
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,180
血仇

393
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,640
牧师
Reverend.

394
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,380
怎么了?
What is it?

395
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,750
女士 我有一些噩耗要告诉你
Ma'am, I have some terrible news.

396
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,890
你不敢告诉我 你和你那些侩子手家人
Couldn't tell me what you and your butchering family

397
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,330
这回都干了什么 是吧?
did this time, could you?

398
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,260
你敢吗?
Could you?

399
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,060
妈的 住手!
God damn it, stop it!

400
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,130
令人发指!
Horrible!

401
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,100
令人发指!
Horrible!

402
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,300
真是令人发指!
Just horrible!

403
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,850
怎么会有人在上帝的眼皮底下
How could any man on God's green earth

404
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,490
做出如此恐怖的事?
do something so horrible?

405
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,360
不是我干的!
It wasn't me!

406
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,530
怎么可能?
How?

407
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,390
该死的
God damn it.

408
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,560
吉姆叔叔和他们
Uncle Jim and them

409
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,230
想彻底摆脱兰德尔・麦考伊
was trying to get rid of Randall McCoy

410
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,200
这样就可以结束这场战争
so all this fighting gets stopped.

411
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,570
他们的出发点是好的
Their intentions was right.

412
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,340
哦 他们的出发点是好的
Oh, their intentions.

413
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,040
说的跟自己没有参与其中似的?
Like you wasn't a part of it?

414
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,370
就算我在那
Even if I was there

415
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,240
也不意味我参与了这场杀戮
don't mean I participated in any killing.

416
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,380
该死 就像人们都说我在行刑队中
Hell, like people said I was in that firing squad

417
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,250
枪决了托尔伯特和...
that killed Tolbert and...

418
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,920
哦 行刑队?
Oh, firing squad?

419
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,880
大家都知道!
Everybody knows!

420
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,850
我是举起了枪
I raised my gun.

421
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,320
但我故意打偏了
I missed on purpose.

422
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,290
昨晚也一样
Last night was no different.

423
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,990
但你确实在那
You were there.

424
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,830
所以你是吉姆・万斯谋杀我全家的帮凶
So you helped Jim Vance murder my entire family?

425
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,900
不 该死的 我没有
Oh, hell no, I didn't.

426
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,570
这真让我恶心
You know, it made me sick.

427
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,540
见鬼 我要是知道他们会这么做
Hell, if I knew they was gonna do such,

428
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,010
我肯定不会去
I'd have never gone.

429
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,620
是那个弱智科顿朝爱丽菲尔开的枪
It was that weak-brained Cotton Top shot Alifair.

430
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,390
吉姆・万斯现在在庆祝了吧
That Jim Vance is celebrating now.

431
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,830
不 他没有
Oh, hell no, he ain't.

432
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,970
爸爸把他和盖打发到萨克尔山去避避风头

433
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,340
他们在芒西湾附近猎鹿
They's a-hunting deer up big Muncey Creek,

434
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,770
就为了搞点吃的
tryin' to put food on the goddamn table,

435
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,270
我们家现在连商店都去不了
'cause our family can't even go to a store

436
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,110
因为可能会有麦考伊的赏金猎人伏击我们
without some McCoy bounty hunter ambushing us.

437
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,860
别这样
Come on.

438
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,000
咱们收拾一下行囊
You know what, let's pack the hell up.

439

收拾一下行囊
Let's pack the hell up.

440

442
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,210
逃离所有这些悲伤和苦难

443
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,580
它让我们受尽折磨
It's tearing us apart.

444
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,590
跟我走吧 南茜
Go away with me, Nance.

445
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,920
咱们走 咱们走吧
Let's go. Let's go.

446
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,700
我要和一个真正的男人一起待在派克维尔 
I'll be in Pikeville with a real man.

447
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,740

450
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,610
对这场血仇的起源我有几个问题
I have a few questions about the origin of this feud.

451
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,540
不是血仇
No feud,

452
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
至少我不这么认为
not from how I see it.

453
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,910
那你怎么形容它呢 先生?
Well, how would you describe it, sir?

454
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,480
一场多年来欺骗和谋杀
A many-year campaign of swindling and murdering

455
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,080
我家族的运动

456
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,390
昂斯・哈特菲尔德和他的族人发起的?

457
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,060
是恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德

458
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
西弗吉尼亚州的威尔逊州长声称
Well, governor Wilson of West Virginia has said

459
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,700
杀害你儿子们的凶手
the men arrested for your sons' murders

460
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,660
是被非法逮捕的

461
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,670
那是文书工作上出现了错误
There was an error of paperwork.

462
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,030
我们的法庭会裁决的

463
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,640
我的家被烧毁了 可不是文书错误
My house burnin' was no paper error.

No court can resolve my daughter, my son shot dead,

465
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,110
我的妻子也受了重伤

466
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,420
公正的上帝不会允许这些暴行!

467
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,620
我们能拍张照片吗 先生?

468
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,230
你的枪

469
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,430
我想请你拿着它

告诉我

487
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,250
嗯哼
Uhhuh.

488
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,160
别改变你的步速
Don't alter your pace.

489
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,220
别到处看
Don't look about.

490
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,030
有人躲在我们前面的树后面

只有两个人知道吉姆和盖去了哪里
Only two people knew where Jim and Cap had gone,

570
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,000

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,670
谁?

575
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
任何人都可能说漏嘴
Anybody could have said something.

576
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,020
我懂
I know.

577
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,890
不是 盖或者吉姆...
No, Cap or Jim...

578
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,850
我明白
I know.

579
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,230
我知道 因为我很确定
I know, 'cause I made sure.

580
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,500
约翰斯不是叛徒犹大
Johnse's no Judas.

581
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,140
不 他不是 但是有人因他而死 莉瓦西
No, he's not, but people died, Levicy.

582
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,270
但是 你不能说你没有一点责任?
Well, you can't say you didn't have a part in that?

583
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,150
我承认我也有责任
And that I'll have to live with,

584
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,080
但是我俩都知道我们的儿子不是一个谨慎的人
but we both know our boy's not a careful person,

585
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,720
尤其是跟女人在一起的时候
especially around women.

586
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,030
你打算怎么做?
What do you intend to do?

587
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,470
睡吧
Get some sleep.

588
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,470
安德森?
Anderson?

589
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,740
你也睡吧
You should too.

590
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,080
好孩子
Good boy.

591
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
嘿 爸爸
Hey, daddy.

592
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,170
你站在那里多久了?
How long you been standing there?

593
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,610
有一会了
A while.

594
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,380
前几天你在哪里?
Where were you the other day?

595
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,090
哦 我去布恩郡寄东西了
Oh, I was up in Boone county making a delivery,

596
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,090
你知道的
you know.

597
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,690
你 唔...
You, uh...

598
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,060
你今天早上要工作吗?
You going to work this morning?

599
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,060
我想我们可以一起去钓鱼
Thought you and me might go fishing.

600
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,230
今天?
Today?

601
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,570
等你干完手上的活 帮我的马装上鞍
When you finish there, saddle my horse.

602
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,780
好的
All right.

603
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,830
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

604
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,130
我和约翰斯需要谈谈
Me and Johnse are gonna have a talk.

605
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,100
我必须知道这是什么意思
I have to know what that means.

606
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,470
你觉得我会伤害他吗?
You think I mean him harm?

607
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,610
不然的话 让我听听是什么
I need to hear otherwise.

608
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,750
我需要听你亲口告诉我
I will hear you say it.

609
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,360
我带他去钓鱼 莉瓦西
I'm taking him fishing, Levicy.

610
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,650
好久不见 哥哥
So long, big brother.

611
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,640
你真的不想钓鱼?
You sure you don't want to fish?

612
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
我就来
I'm going to.

613
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,800
还记得上次
You remember the last time

614
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,240
你带我来这个同样的地方钓鱼吗?
you brought me out to this old fishing hole?

615
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,810
我想不起来了
I don't recall that.

616
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,510
我还记得
I do.

617
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,710
我知道 因为我当时坐在
I know, 'cause I was in that

618
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,980
那边的柳树的树枝上
willow tree over there up in that limb.

619
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,680
你记得你跟我说过什么吗?
You recall what you said to me?

620
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,850
我记得
I do.

621
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,030
你说 如果我掉进水里
You said if I fell in,

622
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,420
我会把鱼吓跑的
I was gonna scare the fish.

623
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,710
一旦我掉进去 可别太指望你
And once I was in, chances of you getting me out

624
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,980
会把我救出来 因为你不喜欢
weren't good on account that you were not partial

625
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,720
在冰水里洗澡
to cold water.

626
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,790
你记得你说过这话吗?
You recall having said that?

627
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:51,960
好吧 我还以为能把你逗笑呢 爸爸
Well, I believe I just coaxed a laugh out of you, pa.

628
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,330
该死 我都不记得上次看你笑是什么时候了
God damn, I don't remember the last time I seen that.

629
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,740
你跟那个麦考伊女孩的结局太糟糕了
It's too bad about you and the McCoy girl.

630
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,270
哪一个?
Which one?

631
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,340
那个跟了别的男人的女孩
The one that ran off with the man

632
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,510
而且还是杀你吉姆叔叔的男人
that killed your uncle Jim.

633
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,880
你记性很好 约翰斯
You recall pretty good, Johnse.

634
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,550
你想要跟我说什么吗?
Anything you want to say to me?

635
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,290
我知道我不该相信她 我很清楚这一点
I know I shouldn't have trusted her. I know that for damn sure.

636
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
我讨厌这一切
You know, I hate all this.

637
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,870
一直都是
I always have.

638
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,200
大概我只想要玩乐吧
I think all I ever wanted to do was play,

639
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,440
尽情地欢笑和玩乐
just laugh and play.

640
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,080
这里的人似乎都不会笑了
Yeah, it seems like nobody around here ever laughs anymore,

641
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,750
除非是哪个麦考伊家的人受伤或者死了
except maybe when a McCoy gets maimed or killed.

642
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,860
这对你来说是一个考验 爸爸
You know, that must be a trial for you, daddy,

643
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,990
我不像你一样
me not being like you.

644
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,130
你没有必要和我一样 约翰斯
You are who you are, Johnse.

645
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,060
不 我是说
No, what I mean is,

646
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,630
所有人都敬重你
everybody looks up to you,

647
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,300
甚至连你的哥哥都是
I mean, even your older brothers.

648
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,240
但是 却没有...
No, there ain't...

649
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,370
没有人敬重我
there ain't nobody looking up to me.

650
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,410
更可悲的是 有人说
Hell, there are those that say

651
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,880
淡毛科顿都比我有用
Cotton Top's of more use.

652
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,250
我都不知道该怎么待在这个家里
I don't know how to be in this family.

653
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,020
我记得...
I mean, I got...

654
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,520
记得所有的事情 你知道吗?
I got all the memories, you know?

655
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,620
我记得所有发生过的事
I know all that's happened.

656
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,860
只是...
I just...

657
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,930
我并不后悔成为哈特菲尔德家族的一员
I don't have the hate that comes with being a Hatfield.

658
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,600
当我抬头仰望的时候 爸爸
You know, I look up at that sky, pa,

659
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,070
看到白云悠闲地飘过
and those clouds going by.

660
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,740
我知道 它们正飞往
I'm telling you, I know they're headed

661
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,510
一个和这里截然不同的地方
somewhere different than what we got here.

662
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,680
我看过一些俄勒冈州的图片和故事
I seen these pictures and these stories about Oregon.

663
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,550
天哪 他们有大片的树木可以砍伐
Man, they got these millions of trees to be logged,

664
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,520
甚至比这里的更多
I mean, even more than here,

665
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,530
河里的有肥美的鱼
wild rivers with fish long as your arm,

666
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,660
不用跟麦考伊家的人打个你死我活
no McCoys to shoot at or get shot by.

667
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,030
那里简直是人间天堂
That's heaven on earth.

668
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,300
就是那样
That's what that is.

669
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,840
那里就是我向往的地方
That's where I aim to go.

670
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,110
在俄勒冈州你会停滞不前 约翰斯
You won't outrun yourself in Oregon, Johnse.

671
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,190
我可以问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

672
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,530
如果那天我掉下去了
If I would have fell in that day,

673
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,660
吓跑了那些鱼...
scared those fish...

674
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,030
你会任由我溺死吗?
Would you have let me drown?

675
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,810
是一只老熊啊
That's a big old bear.

676
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,950
它出现在我们背后 被约翰斯捕获了
Johnse bagged him when he come up behind us.

677
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,290
我都没看到它
I never seen him.

678
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,720
这孩子反应总是很快
That boy always did have quick reflexes.

679
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,460
他只是...
He's just...

680
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,060
拿那点俊俏的外表去玩了
Too damn handsome for his own good.

681
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,270
虽然 除了英俊的外表
Though, he's a lot like his daddy,

682
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,130
他很像他爸爸
except for the handsome part.

683
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,940
这孩子一点儿也不像我
Boy's nothing like me.

684
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,840
大冷天的早上你怎么来了?
What brings you out this frosty morn?

685
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,150
我们的诉求有了回音
Well, I got news about our appeal.

686
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,610
文迪州长正要把这些都
Governor Windy's taking it all the way

687
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,050
上报给美国最高法院
to the United States supreme court.

688
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,790
现在 我们也有法可依了 或许
Now we gonna be in the lawbooks, maybe.

689
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,090
救孩子们出狱
Get our boys out of jail,

690
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,560
回到家里去
back in their homes where they belong.

691
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,820
任何一个懂点法律知识的人 
Anybody who knows anything about jurisprudence

692
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,560
都说这是毫无疑问的
says there ain't no doubt.

693
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,860
只有一个办法可以解决问题 哥哥
Only one thing gonna resolve this, big brother.

694
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,270
而它绝不会是什么法律女士
And it ain't miss jurisprudence.

695
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,740
不知道你们在这里计划什么 昂斯
I don't know what you're planning here, Anse,

696
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,570
但这场该死的战争
but all this damn bloodshed

697
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,840
是该结束了
and killing's got to stop.

698
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,910
希望吉姆叔叔是最后一个牺牲者
Uncle Jim was the last straw.

699
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,380
我要去自首
I'm turning myself in.

700
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,860
你疯了?
You insane?

701
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,820
那帮虚伪的家伙会让你脑袋开花的
Them blaggard's will shoot you down.

702
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,890
我已经放话给佩里・克莱因了
I already sent word to Perry Cline.

703
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,400
佩里・克莱因
Perry Cline.

704
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,870
你认为那个卑鄙小人会信守承诺?
You think that skunk will keep his word?

705
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,570
就这样定了 昂斯
It's done, Anse.

706
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,300
我要用最恰当的方式来结束这场战争
I'm gonna fight this thing the best way I know how.

707
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,310
在法庭上解决
I'm gonna fight it in the courtroom.

708
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,810
在肯塔基的法庭上
In a Kentucky courtroom.

709
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,640
但绝不是武力解决
But not with a damn gun.

710
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,350
我的枪从没让我失望过 沃尔
Well, guns never failed me, wall,

711
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,550
不像那些法官和律师
not like judges and lawyers.

712
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,360
那就只能采取我们之间
Well, it's gonna be the way it's always been

713
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,560
惯用的解决方式了 弟弟
between you and me, little brother.

714
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,370
你用你的办法解决 我用我的方式处理

现在 我不想对你说一些

我将来会后悔的话

861
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,220
你为什么要这样伤害我?
Why'd you hurt me the way you did?

862
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,500
和约翰斯交往你是自作自受
You hurt yourself taking up with Johnse.

863
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,130
我跟他结婚则是把你从痛苦的深渊里拯救出来
Me marrying him just saved you a whole lot of pain.

864
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,900
你爱他吗?
You love him?

865
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,380
从未爱过
I never did.

866
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,160
我恨他 
I hate him,

867
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,520
就跟恨所有该死的哈特菲尔德家的人一样
just like all the demon Hatfields.

868
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,950
我跟约翰斯在一起绝不是想伤害你
Me and Johnse was never nothing against you.

869
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,950
只想跟他们算清旧账
It's just plain old revenge.

870
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,860
从小我就发誓要消灭哈特菲尔德家族
I swore to killing Hatfields when I was young.

871
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,530
我心中只有复仇
Revenge is all I got inside of me.

872
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,600
驾
Yah.

873
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,520
好消息 法官
Good news, judge.

874
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:54,020
最高法院做出了判决 相信这判决是乱来的
The supreme court has ruled, incorrectly, I believe,

875
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,160
不经过西弗吉尼亚州的同意就把你们抓来
that taking you people without West Virginia's consent

876
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,930
是违法的
was illegal.

877
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
我们没事了?
So we going free?

878
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,960
你们听见了吗?
Well, you hear that?

879
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,700
我们自由了!
We're going free!

880
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,160
塞尔柯克
Selkirk.

881
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,970
律师能笑得出来说明事情没那么简单
A lawyer's smile promises more to come.

882
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,470
法院还判决了...这个较合理...
Court also ruled... properly this time...

883
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,510
基于你们已经在肯塔基州
that since you're already in Kentucky,

884
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,640
只要你们再次被合法逮捕
as long as you're legally rearrested,

885
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,510
就可以接受审判
you can be brought to trial.

886
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,880
菲利普斯先生?
Mr. Phillips?

887
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:24,320
先生们 你们被逮捕了
Gentlemen, y'all are under arrest.

888
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,440
是你的女儿罗斯安娜
It's your daughter Roseanna.

889
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,680
我出现在你的身后
I'm coming up behind you.

890
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,880
站在你身旁
I'm standing next to you.

891
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,350
你看见我了吗 爸爸?
You see me, poppy?

892
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,320
你听见我说话了吗?
You hear my voice?

893
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,290
听见了
I hear you.

894
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,030
死去的孩子们
Dead children,

895
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,860
死去的外孙女
a dead grandchild,

896
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,830
疯了的妻子
a mad wife.

897
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,340
每个人都认为你会与尚在人世的女儿紧紧相拥
Anybody'd think you'd embrace a still-living daughter.

898
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,850
我小时候
When I was a little girl,

899
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,580
你曾经跟我说 我是你的最爱的女儿
you once told me I was your favorite.

900
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,150
几年来我一直靠此生活着
I lived on that for years.

901
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:45,100
就是这个小小的肯定能让我坚信
Just that tiny bit of approval made me believe

902
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,970
在这世界上我无所不能
I could do anything in this world.

903
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,870
因为你会给予我告诫
'Cause for all your preaching

904
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,040
你会为我祈祷...
and all your praying...

905
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,110
在我们家 你就是上帝
In our house, you were God.

906
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,050
让我来
Here. Let me take that for you.

907
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,350
你今天看上特别苍白
You're looking particularly pale today.

908
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,990
你没事吧?
Are you well?

909
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,990
没事
Yeah.

910
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,720
谢谢关心
Thanks for asking.

911
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,260
罗斯安娜
Roseanna.

912
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,570
你知道 我...
You know my...

913
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,900
我几年前的那个提议...
my offer of years ago...

914
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,340
现在还有效
It still stands.

915
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,210
哦 佩里
Oh, Perry.

916
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,210
你不会要我的
You don't want me.

917
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,750
我已经是个废人了
I'm all used up.

918
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,220
别这么说
Don't say that.

919
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,290
我真的想跟你在一起
I do want you.

920
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,390
我只是想让你重拾欢乐...
I just want to make you happy...

921
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,420
是啊
Yeah.

922
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,890
还要照顾你
And take care of you.

923
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,330
我得把这些杯子给洗了
I should probably just do these dishes up.

924
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,060
我一直爱着你
I've always loved you.

925
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:29,260
罗斯安娜
Roseanna.

926
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,330
罗斯安娜!
Roseanna!

927
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,370
罗斯安娜!
Roseanna!

928
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,700
兰德尔!
Randall!

929
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,070
医生!
Doc!

930
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,840
罗斯安娜 她不...她不动弹了!
Roseanna, she's not... she's not moving!

931
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:39,810
她晕倒了!
She just fell!

932
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,040
我不知道怎么回事!
I don't understand!

933
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,880
兰德尔 快进来! 哦 上帝!
Randall, get in here! Oh, my God!

934
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,480
罗斯安娜 你听见我说话了吗?
Roseanna, can you hear me?

935
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,710
哦 天哪
Oh, my God.

936
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,880
她在流血! 她流血了!
She's bleeding! She's bleeding!

937
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,620
她怎么了?
What's wrong with her?

938
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,430
孩子他妈
There, there, mother.

939
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:11,430
罗斯安娜・麦考伊之墓 生卒年 1859年至1888年

940
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:46,400
一切都会好起来的
It'll be fine, just fine.

941
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,910
拉瑟福德医生说 在列克星敦有一家医院
Doc rutherford says there's a hospital in Lexington

942
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,780
可以医好你的病
that can help you.

943
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:55,150
你必须让自己心碎
You must let your heart break.

944
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,220
只有当你内心最脆弱的部分受到重创之时
Only when the most innocent part of you suffers

945
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,720
你才可以有所作为
can there be change.

946
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:03,960
否则你将一事无成
Else nothing remains of you.

947
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,890
她今天可以开口说话了吗 兰德尔?
Is she able to talk today, Randall?

948
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:13,060
是的 但是她说的话没有逻辑性
She speaks, but her words carry no meaning.

949
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,530
至少比她苦苦哀号和喋喋不休好得多
An improvement on all her wailing and rabbit noises.

950
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,140
你把我送走不是为了让我康复
You're not sending me away to get better.

951
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,030
你把我送走 
You're sending me away

952
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,440
然后你就可以和佩里・克莱因为所欲为
so you can go to hell with Perry Cline.

953
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,260
驾
Yah.

954
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,720
这是真的吗 我谋杀她在先?
Is it true that I murdered her in the first degree?

955
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,690
爱丽菲尔・麦考伊
Alifair McCoy,

956
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,720
你谋杀了她
you murdered her.

957
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,530
有人指使你这样回答吗?
Did anyone tell you to say this?

958
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,500
你要说没有人指使你
You said to say that no one did.

959
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:38,270
你的意思是说 没有人指使你说任何话?
You mean no one told you to say anything?

960
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,500
只要说我谋杀她在先
Only that I murdered her in the first degree.

961
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,510
我请求法庭
I beg the court.

962
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,410
我的当事人是一个可怜单纯的傻瓜
My client's nothing but a poor, simpleminded fool.

963
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,320
天生如此
Born that way.

964
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,120
既然他已经认罪
Now, he admits his guilt

965
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,420
请求法庭从宽发落
and throws himself on the mercy of the court.

966
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,960
沃尔・哈特菲尔德
Wall Hatfield,

967
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,230
终身监禁
life in prison.

968
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:12,630
塞尔柯克・麦考伊
Selkirk McCoy,

969
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,500
终身监禁
life in prison.

970
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,440
亚历克斯・梅塞尔
Alex Messer,

971
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,140
终身监禁
life in prison.

972
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:25,250
"淡毛科顿" 艾利生・芒茨
"Cotton Top" Ellison Mounts,

973
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,410
处以绞刑
death by hanging.

974
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,420
没关系
That's fine.

975
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,820
因为恶魔昂斯 盖 还有其他所有人
'Cause Devil Anse, Cap, and all of them

976
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,460
将会在午夜时分 全副武装前来
gonna come at midnight all armed and terrible,

977
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,430
骑着黑色的战马 马蹄闪闪发光
riding dark horses with lightning hooves

978
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,400
他们是不死的战神
that don't never die.

979
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,400
他们不会让我被绞死的
They won't let me hang.

980
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,810
放他出去
I'm letting him out.

981
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,910
给我钥匙
Give me the keys.

982
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,950
放他出去
I'm letting him out.

983
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,380
他们唯一要处死的那个哈特菲尔德的人
The only Hatfield they're hanging

984
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,620
他是无辜的
is the one that don't deserve it.

985
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,320
处死一个...
It's bad luck to hang a...

986
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,650
处死一个智障的孩子 这是不道德的
it's bad luck to hang a half-wit.

987
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,760
那只是妇人之见 兰德尔 
No, that's an old wives' tale, Randall.

988
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,790
公正何在?
Where is my justice?

989
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,360
何在?
Where is it?

990
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:19,500
你应该回家 清醒清醒
You know, you need to go home and sober up some.

991
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,530
你
You

992
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,700
你们可以苟活于世...
you get to live...

993
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,410
而我的孩子们却要在坟墓里慢慢腐烂
While my sons, my daughter rot in their graves.

994
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,020
我也该把你放出去
I might as well let you out too.

995
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,520
给我该死的钥匙
Give me the goddamn keys.

996
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,000
把他弄出去
Get him out of here.

997
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:40,180
不知何时我们当中的一人
Was there a point where one of us

998
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,080
才能放下这些无谓的执念?
could have gave way to stop all this nonsense?

999
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,750
我想你可以考虑一下
I guess you can contemplate that.

1000
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,950
是你没有放下
You still got something left.

1001
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,850
你到底想要什么 兰德尔?
What do you want, Randall?

1002
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,420
嗯?
Hmm?

1003
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,390
你想从这人生中获得些什么?
What do you want out of this life?

1004
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,400
但求平静度过
Just get through it.

1005
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,930
如果说有两个人一直彼此误会的话
If ever two men misunderstood each other,

1006
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,430
那无疑说的就是我们
it was us.

1007
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,700
这一切何时才能结束?
So when does it end?

1008
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:11,270
当流尽最后一滴血之时
When there's no blood left to be spilled.

1009
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,950
没有用的 兰德尔
That way don't work, Randall.

1010
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,320
我们已经试过了
We tried that way.

1011
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,130
我计划着在夜深人静的时候
I figure we go in the dead of night

1012
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,230
当浓雾弥漫之时
when the fog is thickest.

1013
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,100
我们派五个人前往北部连续扫射
Get five men blazing away in the north end

1014
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,970
在派克维尔制造一起前所未有的骚乱
causing commotion like Pikeville had never seen.

1015
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,300
然后我们冲进监狱把其他人...
And we charge that jail with everybody else...

1016
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,140
谁都不准闯监狱救人
Nobody's busting anybody out of jail.

1017
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,440
什么?
What?

1018
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,380
沃尔叔叔 你的哥哥 
Uncle wall, your big brother,

1019
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,680
无辜受罪
got life for doing nothing.

1020
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,220
沃尔不会跟你们走的
Wall wouldn't go anyways.

1021
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,680
他希望通过上诉可以获释
He's fighting it with appeals.

1022
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,020
他希望光明正大地走出监狱
Still thinks he'll get out legal.

1023
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,360
那淡毛科顿呢?
What about Cotton Top?

1024
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,530
我们可是告诉各大报刊
We're telling every goddamn newspaper in the country

1025
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,600
我们会营救他的
we're coming for him.

1026
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:47,070
淡毛科顿被处死之时
When Cotton Top's hanged,

1027
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,170
便是麦考伊家族放下屠刀之日
it'll take away the McCoy bloodlust.

1028
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,700
什么时候行刑?
When he's hanged?

1029
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,710
那么科顿是我们的犹大羊吗?
So cotton's our Judas goat?

1030
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,710
犹大羊 把羊群引领至屠宰场的领路羊

1031
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,820
必须有人委曲牺牲才能结束这一切
Somebody's got to bend to stop it.

1032
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,620
兰德尔不肯 那么...
Randall can't, so...

1033
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,050
只能由我来做
It's got to be me.

1034
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,630
爸爸 你...你做得够多了
Pa, you... you done enough.

1035
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,200
是时候我来接手了
It's time I take over.

1036
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,670
我不希望你变成我这样子
I don't want that for you.

1037
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,670
你肯不肯听我一句劝告?
Weren't you listening to me?

1038
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:36,350
盖 你...你终有一天会有自己的孩子
Cap, you gonna... you gonna have children one day,

1039
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,480
你的孩子们
and your children,

1040
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,650
他们将不再关心
they're not gonna care about our old grudges

1041
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,550
祖先们的恩恩怨怨
and slights from long ago.

1042
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,490
而他们的孩子...
And their children...

1043
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,330
他们的孩子们甚至不会知晓这些
Hell, their children won't even know about it.

1044
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,700
孩子 是时候放下过去继续前进了
It's time for us to move on, son.

1045
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:21,690
哦
Oh.

1046
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,760
该死的
Damn.

1047
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,960
该死的
Damn it.

1048
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:29,230
莉瓦西 你还好吗?
Levicy, you all right?

1049
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,140
我想念约翰斯
I miss Johnse.

1050
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,340
我想念我们的孩子
I miss our son.

1051
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,050
有时我在想
I sometimes wonder

1052
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:49,050
如果我当时同意他和第一个女孩的婚事
how different things might have turned out

1053
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,250
事情是否会有所不同
had I allowed him to marry the first one.

1054
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,230
罗斯安娜也是麦考伊家族的人
Well, Roseanna was a McCoy.

1055
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,860
我们不得不做出我们认为正确的判断
We had to do what we thought was right.

1056
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,770
让我看看 让我看看
Let me see. Let me see.

1057
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,750
噢!
Ow!

1058
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:19,680
离开这里!
Let's get out of here!

1059
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,180
这一切快点结束吧
Got to get this thing over with

1060
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,520
要不然又得开战了
before we go to war again.

1061
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,380
再说一次 到底什么事情如此重要
Tell me again, what's so important

1062
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,750
我们为何要盛装打扮女孩们
we had to dress up the girls

1063
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,220
然后一路把她们带到这里
and bring them all the way here

1064
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:58,150
来看一个几乎看不清的东西?
for something you can hardly see?

1065
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:01,750
这是见证历史的时刻
This is history.

1066
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,760
哈特菲尔德和麦考伊久负盛名
Hatfields and McCoys are famous.

1067
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,930
因为什么?
Famous for what?

1068
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,990
互相残杀
Killing each other.

1069
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,660
过来
Come here.

1070
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:43,700
大家在这里集合一下
Let's gather over here.

1071
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,980
你们当中大多数人都设过陷阱
Most of you have done some trapping

1072
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,780
有时候会偶尔见到一条雪狐
and, on occasion, found a winter fox

1073
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,020
扯断腿 从陷阱中逃脱出去
that's left his leg behind him in the trap.

1074
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:16,760
如今我们正面临这样的困境
So it is with us on this difficult day.

1075
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:21,930
不得不做出这样的牺牲
Leave our leg behind,

1076
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:23,770
否则就坐等灭亡
or die in the trap.

1077
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,710
这里有一封即将寄给报社的信件
Got a letter here that we're gonna send to the newspapers.

1078
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,110
我希望你们能够首先听一下
I wanted you to all hear it first.

1079
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:39,080
"我不..."
"I do not..."

1080
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,250
"我不希望这段世仇再延续下去"
"I do not wish to keep the old feud alive."

1081
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:05,110
"我想所有人 包括我自己"
"I suppose everybody, like myself,

1082
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,310
"厌倦了所谓的哈特菲尔德和麦考伊的家族恩怨"
"is tired of the names 'Hatfield' and 'McCoy'

1083
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,550
"以及和平年代的边界战争"
"and border warfare in a time of peace."

1084
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,400
"我厌倦了战争"
"The war spirit in me has abated."

1085
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:32,640
"我虔诚地为眼前和平美景而欣喜"
"And I sincerely rejoice at the prospect of peace."

1086
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:40,880
"我把一生都献给无休止的战争"
"I've devoted my life to arms,

1087
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:43,140
"而我们在这场可憎的争斗中"
"and we have undergone a fearful loss"

1088
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,680
"失去了我们平静的生活"
"of Noble lives and valuable property"

1089
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,020
"以及我们宝贵的财富"
"in this hateful struggle."

1090
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,650
哈特菲尔德的人让我这样做的
The Hatfields made me do it.

1091
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:53,720
他们用所谓的爱哄骗了我
They hornswoggled me with love.

1092
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,880
"我们如同亚当"
"We, being like Adam,

1093
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:18,980
"并非始作俑者"
"are not the first transgressors.

1094
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:23,850
"我请求放下心中恩怨 和平相处"
"And I propose to rest in the spirit of peace."

1095
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,300
- 谢谢 女士 - 不用客气
- Thank you, ma'am. - Obliged.

1096
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,700
警长大人 我的名字是亚历山大
Sheriff, my name is Alexander.

1097
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,970
我是您忠实的崇拜者
I'm a big fan of yours.

1098
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:46,240
亚历山大?
Alexander?

1099
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,210
谢谢 孩子
Well, thank you, son.

1100
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,940
恶人弗兰克就在这里 就在这里
"Bad Frank" there, right there.

1101
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,480
恭喜你 弗兰克
Congratulations, Frank.

1102
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:55,080
我看过了
I read it.

1103
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,820
这...
It's...

1104
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,750
其实 你也应该恭喜我一下
Well, I, too, am to be congratulated.

1105
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,420
这位是卡罗琳・罗斯女士
Meet Miss Carolyne Roes,

1106
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,260
来自列克星敦的罗斯家族
of the Roes of Lexington.

1107
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,620
她是我的未婚妻
She's my fiancee.

1108
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,560
他们拥有半个郡的家业
They own half the county

1109
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:10,090
还拥有数量可观的优良赛马
and quite a stable of fine racehorses.

1110
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,900
你喜欢她们的年轻 是不是 克莱因?
You like them young, don't you, Cline?

1111
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,940
简直是老牛吃嫩草
You cradle-robbing snake.

1112
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,910
她又不是醉了
She ain't no drunkard,

1113
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,710
这个谎话连篇的可笑东西
and this laughable pack of lies ain't nothing

1114
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,080
不过是浪费了一张纸罢了
but a waste of cheap paper.

1115
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,680
狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

1116
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,580
来啊!
Come on!

1117
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:30,380
随时奉陪!
Any time!

1118
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,520
老大 住手!
Boss, come on!

1119
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:34,090
滚出去!
Get out of here!

1120
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,420
老大? 老大?
Boss? Boss?

1121
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,750
我会悼念他的
I shall miss him.

1122
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:11,290
只有恶人弗兰克才能杀了哈特菲尔德家的人!
Bad Frank could kill Hatfields like no one else!

1123
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,890
1914年 肯塔基州

1124
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,230
我来找你了
I'm coming after you,

1125
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:57,300
恶魔昂斯!
Devil Anse!

1126
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:58,270
你听到我说话了吗?
You hear me?

1127
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,270
你听到我说话了吗?
You hear me?

1128
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,110
我来地狱见你了!
I'm coming to hell after you!

1129
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,790
? 我们相聚河畔 ?

1130
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:24,690

? 立其间 ?

1132
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:32,630
我现在施洗于你 使你归入圣父 圣子
I baptize you in the name of the father, the son,

1133
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,270

1134
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:38,510
阿门
Amen.

1135
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,310
? 我们相聚河畔 ?
Gather at the river

1136
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,310

1138
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,150
? 与众圣徒相聚 ?

1139
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,780
? 在河畔 ?
At the river

1140
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,790

? 宝座前 ?
Of God
