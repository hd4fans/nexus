停
Stop.

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,670
听着 我想亲手将你干掉
See, I want to just shoot you myself.

4
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,610
但我要顾及我的兄弟们
But I got to humor my brothers.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,050
再过不久 黎明时分

我会给你这把手枪

Now, will you do the honorable thing and kill yourself?

8
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,620
为什么我要这么做?
why in god's name would I do that?

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,360
羞耻和悔恨
shame and remorse.

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,290
屁话
bullshit.

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,470
不 你们
No, you all,

12
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,200
你们只是害怕成为谋杀犯
You just want to save yourselves from doing a murder.

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,240
爱上罗斯安娜 我一点也不羞耻
And I ain't ashamed of loving roseanna.

14
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,990
这么说他不愿自己动手
so he won't die by his own hand.

15
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,790
他愿意服毒吗?
will he eat poison?

16
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,890
去死吧
to hell with this.

17
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,530
把枪放下
guns down.

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,400
快
Now.

19

我说立刻
I said now.

20
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,270
照他说的做 不然你们的脑袋
do what he says, or I'll scatter your brains

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,040
将遍地开花
All over this place.

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,370
剩下的都跪到你哥哥旁边去
the rest of you kneel down there next to your brother

23
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,370
祈祷吧 你们的命全取决于它了
And pray as if your lives depend on it,

24
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,770
看他们心情好坏
On account they do.

25
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,840
你聋了吗 麦考伊?
Are you deaf, mccoy?

26
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,410
我说跪下
I said to kneel.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,110
我不跪任何人
I kneel for no man.

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,450
并且我只对上帝祈祷
And I pray only to god,

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
不对你
Not you.

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,590
你很勇敢 吉姆・麦考伊
you're a brave man, jim mccoy.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,870
你爸爸应该感到骄傲
Your daddy should be proud.

32
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,440
一切就绪 臭鼬头 放火
All right, skunkhair, torch it.

33
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,850
你知道吗 我们早该烧掉这个该死的地方
you know, we should've burnt down this shithole years ago.

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,190
喔!
Whoo!

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,530
这不关你的事
this is none of your business.

36
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,130
放开我!
get off me!

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,170
你这该死的蠢货 竟然自投罗网
you're a damn fool for riding into mccoy hands.

38
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,940
现在这都不重要了
none of that matters now.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,910
罗斯安娜怀了我的孩子
Roseanna's carrying my baby.

40

约翰斯 她是麦考伊的人

you watch your filthy mouth, hatfield.

147
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,970
可能会起纷争
might be some rowdy-do.

148
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
无论发生什么 科顿 你就待在这别动
Whatever happens, cotton, you stay right here.

149
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,170
别让马受惊
Keep these horses peaceable.

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,140
哈!

151
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,450
耶 麦考伊退缩了

152
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,020
向后退了一步
Skipped off a step.

153
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,350
哈特菲尔德 拉屎拉裤裆了
hatfield, he shit himself.

154
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,820
你自己都可以闻到
You can smell it yet.

155
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,190
你说该怎么做 艾利生?
how'd you see it, ellison?

156
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
似乎大家都挺绅士
seems to me both men behaved gentlemanly.

157
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,060
如果谁让一步 大家就算了
If anyone looked off, they both did together.

158
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,170
我们走
let's go.

159
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,340
这是你欠我的
that is for owing me almost

160
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
我的传家宝小提琴你还欠我一美元
A whole greenback on my heirloom fiddle

161
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,110
一年了 你个偷窃的狗杂种
For a year, you thieving prick.

162
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,880
约翰斯是对的
johnse was right.

163
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,620
你打人就像老女人
You hit like a old woman.

164
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,490
或许你应该穿上裙子戴上女帽
Maybe we should get you a bonnet and a dress.

165
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,660
够了

166
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,620
我才是恶魔!
I am hell on earth!

167
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,660
你是该死的臭猪
you're a damn stinkhog.

168
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,300
够了
that's enough now.

169

交给你了 艾利生

170
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,070
哈特菲尔德的人 别插手

201
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,670
把他抬到那上面去
Gonna get him up there...

202
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,900
他总是谋求和平
He was always angling for peace,

203
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,970
平息他人挑起的争端
Throwing water on fires that others started,

204
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,610
从不多管闲事 但现在却...

现在却可能因此丧命

206

艾利生对你说什么了?
What did Ellison say to you?

207
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,320
他想见科顿

208
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,090
我们逮到他们了!

昂斯 我们捉住他们了

212
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,750
警长 你不能让他们带走我们
Sheriff, you can't let them take us.

213
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,220
昂斯 你弟弟怎么样了?
How's your brother, Anse?

214
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,690
还活着...

215
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,120
勉强来说
Barely.

216
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,960
我要你把这些犯人交给我 警长
I need you to hand over your prisoners, Sheriff.

217
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,330
我明白你的感受 昂斯
I understand how you feel, Anse.

218
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,230
但这些人在肯塔基州土地上
But these boys broke Kentucky law

219
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,500
违反了肯塔基州的法律
On Kentucky soil and are obliged

220
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,670
必须交由肯塔基州的法院审判
To be tried by Kentucky justice.

221
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,240
是吗
Yeah.

222
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,840
无论如何我都要带走他们
Well, I'll take 'em anyways.

223
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,210
昂斯 让我说几句
Anse, give me a minute.

224
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,450
我要将这整件事都记录下来
I want to go on a record about all this.

225
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,480
我正希望你这样做 法官 
I wish you would, Judge.

226
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,720
向你的弟弟解释一下 不管他和你 
Explain to your brother howsoever he and you

227
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,430
还有其他哈特菲尔德家的人什么感受...
And the other Hatfields feel...

228
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,820
我知道这很难受...
and I know that's awful...

229
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,660
这事都要通过法律途径解决
This business requires to be done legal.

230
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,600
警长 你得承认受害者是
Sheriff, you acknowledge the victim

231
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,260
西弗吉尼亚州的公民
Was a west Virginia citizen.

232
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,830
这是此案的本质所在
That's the essence of the case determinative.

233
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,970
也是西弗吉尼亚州法律存在的原因
That's why west Virginia law prevails.

234
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,770
现在 现在争论这个问题或是留到法庭上
Now, you can dispute the matter here or later in court.

235
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,140
作出选择吧 你这个婊子养的
It's your choice, you son of a bitch.

236
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,650
别到时候一个都没得选
You're likely to lose in either venue.

237
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,050
驾
Yah.

238
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,590
你们居然在我反对下强行带走这些孩子
You abscond with these boys over my strenuous objection.

239
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,960
冷静 冷静
Easy, easy.

240
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,530
该死
Damn.

241
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,320
他...他要死了吗?
He gon...He gonna die?

242
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,990
本来早就死了
Should've already.

243
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,980
噢 我的上帝
Oh, my lord.

244
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,950
收到托比亚斯・瓦格纳法官的指示
Obtained a directive from Judge Tobias Wagner

245
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,290
命令警长夺回孩子们并将他们

246

送到他的合法羁押所
To his lawful custody.

247
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,820
警长
Sheriff.

248
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,290
法律...
The law...

249
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,730
狗屁不如
Ain't worth a bucket of spit.

250
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,030
他们...他们这是违法绑架
They...They were kidnapped illegal.

251
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,800
为什么我们不用同样的方法将他们绑回来?
So why can't we kidnap 'em back the same way?

252
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
不行 哈特菲尔德家族会严密看管他们的
No, Hatfields will have 'em heavily guarded.

253
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,770
有可能会变成一场血战
Could turn into a bloodbath.

254
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
亲爱的耶稣 他们都干了些什么?
Sweet Jesus, what have they done?

255
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,870

258

爸爸 你不能去那里
Poppy, you ain't going over there.

259
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,660
我一个人去他不会伤害我的
Alone he'll do me no harm.

260
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,010
是爸爸

266
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,510
- 他是来救我们的 - 他来了 爸爸
- He's coming to get us. - There he is, poppy.

267
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,440
我手无寸铁前来 请求带走我的孩子们
I come unarmed to ask you for my boys.

268
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,040
我向你保证
You got my word.

269
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,940
我会把他们送上派克维尔法庭
I'll turn 'em over to the law in Pikeville.

270
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,310
你的孩子捅了我的弟弟
Your boys stabbed my brother.

271
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,950
不断地用刀捅他 然后开枪打死了他
They stabbed him over and over again, then shot him.

272
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,890
肯塔基州对谋杀罪的惩罚
Penalty for that's the same in Kentucky

273
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,520
和西弗吉尼亚州是一样的
As it is in West Virginia.

274
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,860
艾利生怎样了?
How is Ellison?

275
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,230
我祈祷他能痊愈
I pray he recovers.

276
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,140
你还相信祈祷这回事?
You still believe in praying?

277
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,510
我相信
I do.

278
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,280
好吧 那我们就让万能的主来决定这事
Well, then we'll leave it to the almighty.

279
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,410
如果我弟弟活下来了 你就可以带走你的孩子
If my brother survives, you can have your boys,

280
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,980

And we'll let Kentucky law take its course.

281
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,350
如果他死了...
If he dies...

282
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,820
如果我弟弟死了
If my brother dies,

283
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,290
你的孩子在这里绝不会有命活到
Your boys will stay here not long before justice

284
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,320
法庭来裁判他们
Will be done on 'em.

285
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,330
我说什么或者付出什么
Is there anything I can say or give you

286
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,900
能让你改变主意?
That'll move you from that?

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
没有
No.

288
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,370
我想见见我的儿子们
I'd like to see my sons.

289
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,640
我不同意
I don't think so.

290
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,080
那就让他们母亲见见他们
Then let their mother see 'em.

291
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,520
我们会派人过去接她
We'll send for her.

292
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德
Devil Anse Hatfield,

293
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,440
我真后悔那天救了你
I rue the day I saved your life.

294
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,310
愿上帝诅咒你的不朽的灵魂
May God damn your eternal soul.

295
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,680
兰德尔 或许吧
That might be, Randall.

296
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,250
但我不记得那天是上帝救了你的小命
But I don't recall God saving your ass that day.

297
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,690
我们救了彼此 因为那是...
We saved each other, 'cause that's...

298
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,560
因为那是男人在战争中该做的
'cause that's what men do in war.

299
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,630
这里发生的一切之所以变成这样
This all here, this all sits the way it sits,

300
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,060
都是我们自己的事 与他人无关
'cause of us and nobody else.

301
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,430
要是你觉得有必要再提一次上帝
If you feel the need to bring up God one more time,

302
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,200
是站在哪一边的话...
Whose side he sits on...

303
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,840
你绝对回不了家
You won't be making a ride home.

304
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,010
驾

我希望你和你家所有亲戚

307

还有朋友和婴儿

308
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,960
都来救他们 那我们就可以把你们一网打尽
Come and try to rescue 'em so's we kill you all at once,

309
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,830
就不用逼你们出来
Not drag it out.

吉姆说我们得准备一口棺材

你再锯木板试试看

没我允许不准锯什么木板

431
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,450
"我切切地恨恶他们"
"I hate them with perfect hatred.

432
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,710
"以他们为仇敌"
I count them mine enemies."

433
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,280
你的弑兄仇人也是我的杀父仇人
same family that killed your brothers killed my pap.

434
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,150
总有人得做点什么
Somebody ought to do something about it.

435
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,160
没见着你姐姐
I don't see your sister.

436
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,190
罗斯安娜生病了

437
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,890
还待在贝蒂阿姨那里

438
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,500
哪都去不了
Can't travel none.

439
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,000
她流产了吗?
she lose the baby?

440
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,200
没有 她生了个女孩
no, it come, a girl,

441
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,570
但那孩子身体很弱
But it's sickly.

442
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,140
快死了吗?
likely to perish?

443
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,610
我祈祷她不会
I pray not.

444
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,070
但应该快了吧
but likely.

445
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,480
可能吧
likely.

446
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,950
孩子的爸爸是约翰斯・哈特菲尔德...

447
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,520
人们都说他也参与了残杀你哥哥的事
Folks are saying he was amongst them that killed your brothers.

448
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,990
我祈祷他没有
I pray he wasn't.

449
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,890
好像是真的
likely was.

450
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
那只是好像
likely.

451
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,590
托尔伯特...

452
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,090
费默尔...

他们遭遇了如此的

不公正和残忍的谋杀
Manifest injustice and cruelly murdered,

456
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,410
当他们站在上帝面前
When they stand before the lord,

457
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,480
上帝会洗去他们的罪恶
He will wash away their sins

458
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,410
带他们去乐土
And take them to the promised land.

459
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,280
人们忘记
people forget

460
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,490
哈特菲尔德家的人也杀了我爸爸
Hatfields killed our pap too.

461
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,390
一位从战场归来的正直士兵
Honest soldier coming home from war

462
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,460
什么坏事也没做
Doing no harm.

463
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,830
那是哈特菲尔德家欠下的另外一笔血债
That's another item goes on hatfield's account...

464
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,800
闭嘴 过来

465
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,200
虽然已经过去很久了
which reckoning is past due,

466
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,900
证据也不容易找到
Which bill needs collectin'.

467
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,400

我接受捐赠和善款

我代表麦考伊家族感谢你

472
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,960
要让罪人得到惩罚

473
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,530
耶稣会赞赏你和你家人

谢谢 谢谢

475
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,450
你不应该再待在这了

476
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,020
你已经坐在这好几天了

我知道他的仇已经报了

478
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,130
我想我爸爸

479
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,530
我弟弟总是以事业为重
my brother was always about the work of life.

480
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,300
他...
He'd...

481
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,710
他不会
He'd not...

482
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,380
他不会想看到你对着他的坟墓如此消沉...
He'd not want you lingering about his remains...

483
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,520
特别是...还有很多活等着你去干
Not when...not when there's chores to do.

484
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,150
镇子上太多生面孔了
a lot of strange faces in town.

485
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,220
都是缉凶猎人 兰德尔
man hunters, randall,

486
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,060
他们来是为了给你儿子讨个公道
Here to bring your sons' killers to justice.

487
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,790
他们来才不是为了这个
they ain't here for justice.

488
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,330
他们是冲着我们悬赏奖金来的
They're here to try and collect the bounty we're offering.

489
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,970
女士
Ma'am.

490
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:09,699
这是恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德的伐木工厂吗?
this here devil anse hatfield's loggin' enterprise?

491
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:12,269
恶魔昂斯明早才回来
devil anse won't be back till tomorrow mornin'.

492
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:15,879
如果你想找工作 他只雇佣熟人
If you're looking for work, he only hires men he know:

493
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,579
邻居 或者亲戚
His neighbors, his kin.

494
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:21,179
好吧 我有笔生意要给你做

495
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:24,549
你什么意思?
what's that?

496
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:27,919
汤姆 你头发里有一撮可笑的白毛
you got that funny streak of white in your hair, tom.

497
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,689
我猜 所以人们才叫你臭鼬头
Guess that's why folks call you skunkhair.

498
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:32,129
我的朋友才那么叫我
my friends call me that.

499
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:35,059
汤姆 怪不得我们做不了朋友
well, no reason we can't be friends, tom.

500
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,869
别生气
Don't get testy.

501
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:41,729
我只是做好本职工作
I'm just doing my job.

502

你可是被通缉的 臭鼬头汤姆・华莱士先生
You got a prize on your head, mr. Skunkhair tom wallace.

you got the wrong man. I didn't do nothin'.

504
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,639
肯塔基州法庭可不是这么说的
kentucky courts say otherwise.

505
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,509
肯塔基州在拖轮河那边 你迷路了吧
you must've crossed the tug and got lost.

506
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:52,549
这里是西弗吉尼亚
This here west virginia.

507
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,409
我没找错地方 汤姆
I'm in the right place, tom.

508
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,349
麦考伊家已就他家三个孩子的谋杀
Mccoy family's gettin' indictments for them

509
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,219

511
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,859

00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,019
悬赏多少?
How much?

513
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:06,589
具体数字我记不清了
I don't recollect exact.

514
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:08,559
只是抓你的话肯定没多钱
Couldn't be more than two bits or so for you.

515
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:09,999
你这个狗娘养的
you son of a bitch.

516
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,499
把它关上
shut it down.

517
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:32,769
然后拿下来
Take 'em off.

518
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,539

昂斯!

531
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,129

532
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,169

觉得这下我们就扯平了

537
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:56,649
昂斯舅舅 我在伐木场发现了这些
uncle anse, I found these in the logs

538
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:59,489
放在臭鼬头的尸体下
Underneath skunkhair.

539
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,959
悬赏七百五美元杀你
$750 for you.

540
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:04,959
看看你是怎么当匪领的

541

545
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,909

546
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:19,439
你是麦考伊背叛者

547
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,179
六百美元?
$600?

548
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:23,279
那是沃尔叔叔
that's uncle wall.

549
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:27,319
沃尔叔叔根本没参与那场射杀
uncle wall wasn't even in that shootin'.

550
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,849
这下一发不可收拾了
this is out of hand.

551
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,189
一群贪钱的逃兵和吸血鬼
greedy bushwhackers and bloodsuckers by the dozens

552
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:36,959
正在到处追杀我们

553
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,999

554
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,559
盖

其他人都回去工作

558
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:51,539
利亚斯

00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,379
- 快点 - 昂斯 跟你说几句

560
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:58,709
我觉得我们应该储存一些物资和弹药
Reckon we ought to stock up on supplies and ammo.

561
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,119
但如果武装队来的话 我们就把他们引进山里
We need to take to them hills if a posse comes.

562
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,589
没人比我们更熟悉这些山了
nobody knows these hills like us.

563
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,629
沿岸都设上放哨的
Set up lookouts along the tug.

564
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:17,029
他们再也不能出其不意地抓住我们了
We won't get caught unawares again.

565
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:19,599
嗯
uh-huh.

566
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,739
罗斯安娜近况如何?
what do you hear of roseanna?

567
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,339
我曾经有个女儿叫做罗斯安娜
I once had a daughter roseanna,

568
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,709
如今我已经当她死了
Who's now dead to me.

569
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:34,509
莎莉过得如何?
How's sally holding up?

570
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,049
糟糕透了 你想说什么?
poorly. How would you expect?

571
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,419
女人总是特别受照顾 不是吗?
women are fortunate to enjoy special consideration, hmm?

572
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,659
如果每次悲剧发生后 
If I curled up in a ball

573
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,019
我都像刺猬一样蜷缩成一团
every tragic turn of events,

574
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:46,059
那么我什么也做不好了
I'd never get any work done.

575
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,529
不要再像个白痴一样说话
quit talkin' like an imbecile.

576
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:49,899
你没有体会过丧子之痛
You never lost your sons.

577
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,529
克莱因先生?
Mr. Cline?

578
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,769
对不起 我们现在很忙
not now. We're busy here.

579
00:43:56,069 --> 00:44:01,009
再忙也得把二百五十美金的赏金付给我
not too busy to pay me the $250 bounty owed me

580
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:03,679
臭鼬头汤姆・华莱士先生的
On mr. Skunkhair tom wallace.

581
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,449
你们要看他的耳朵吗?
Should I have brung his ears too?

582
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,389
把那令人反胃的东西拿走
put that abomination away.

583
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:20,289
我要赏金
I'm owed the bounty.

584
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:23,389
我们没有提出这种要求
there were no conditions imposed.

585
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:25,099
我们不是野蛮人
we are not savages.

586
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:28,029
我们的职责是将野蛮人绳之于法
It is our duty to bring the savages in for justice.

587
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,369
请不要再残忍地对待他们的尸体了
avoiding unnecessary wear and tear on their corpses.

588
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:34,039
我差一点就逃不出西弗吉尼亚州了
had to get me out of west virginie quick.

589
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,879
我的马承受不了多一个尸体的重量
Couldn't strain my horse toting a whole carcass.

590
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:39,779
你叫什么名字?
what's your name?

591
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,279
弗兰克・菲利普斯.
frank phillips

592
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:44,479
你就是那个传说中的"恶人弗兰克"?
you the one they call "Bad frank"?

593
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,419
不要当面这样称呼我
not to my face.

594
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,789
不要再有第二次
And not twice.

595
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:52,359
请不要再来领取更多的赏金了 菲利普斯先生
do not come back for more reward money, mr. Phillips.

596
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,559
我们家族向来不喜暴力行事
I will not be a party to atrocity.

597
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,759
我们申请到了关于谋杀案的诉求书
any event, we got our indictments

598
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,859
我们会委派代表去拖轮河对岸
Against the murderers, and we're sending deputies

599
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,599
负责此事
Across the tug.

600
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,569
毫无疑问 他们会妥善处理的
No doubt they'll handle things just fine.

601
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,529
女士
Ma'am.

602
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,329
我想见见罗斯安娜
I'd like to see roseanna.

603
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,829
见见我们的孩子
See our baby.

604
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:14,369
即便她现在身体健康
even if she weren't too sickly,

605
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:16,839
她也不愿意见到杀死自己亲兄弟的凶手
She'd not want to see the murderer of her brothers.

606
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,279
我没有...我没有杀死他们
I didn't...I didn't murder 'em.

607
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,109
我当时确实举枪了
I raised my rifle.

608
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:25,109
但我的子弹从他们头顶飞过
I shot over their heads.

609
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:26,279
不信你可以问问亚历克斯・梅塞尔
You can ask alex messer.

610
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:32,889
我为我和罗斯安娜 还有我们的孩子
I built a cabin for me, roseanna,

611
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,519
建造了一个小木屋
And the baby to live at.

612
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,859
它真的很漂亮 窗户上面还贴了油纸
It's a--it's a real nice one with an oilpaper window.

613
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,059
小木屋是为了你的酿酒事业建的吧
you built a cabin for your whiskey business

614
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,699
然后就可以跟那些妓女鬼混了
And to consort with whores.

615
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,469
他妈的
god damn it.

616
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:49,069
我千辛万苦到这里来
I took a chance coming here.

617
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,739
他们还悬赏捉拿我
They got a reward out for me.

618
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:57,239
求您了
Please.

619
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:00,309
一个男人...
A man...

620
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,279
他有权利见自己的孩子
A man's got a right to see his own child.

621
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:05,849
在这里你什么权利都没有
 you got no rights here.

622
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:09,519
快点从我面前消失
Now, get yourself off my porch and gone.

623
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:22,969
我有权利!
I got my rights!

624
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,099
我告诉你!
I'm tellin' you that!

625
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:26,769
他妈的!
God damn it!

626
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:48,759
驾
Come on, girl.

627
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:19,889
看到他了吗?
you see him?

628
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:22,759
看到他了吗?
You see him?

629
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:23,899
看到他了吗?
You see him?

630
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,229
是的
yeah.

631
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,269
看到他了
I got him.

632
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:30,869
开枪
shoot him.

633
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:32,999
小点声 帕里斯
just be quiet, parris.

634
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:40,749
打中了吗?
did you get him?

635
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,979
没有
no.

636
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,099
表明身份
identify yourself.

637
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:24,039
再说一次 表明身份
I said identify yourself.

638
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:46,529
赏金猎人
bounty hunters.

639
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:50,029
最下三滥的那种
Worst kind of trash.

640
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,969
盖 拿出纸笔
cap, get your paper and quill.

641
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:56,739
是时候给兰德尔・麦考伊警告了
Time to put randall mccoy on notice.

642
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,569
在镇子外面几英里的地方发现这些绑着的马
found these horses ground-tied a few miles out of town.

643
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:31,469
我想应该把它们带回来给警长大人
Figured I'd bring 'em in for the sheriff.

644
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:32,769
上面有一封信
Letter pinned on there is addressed

645
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:37,539
是给克莱因律师和麦考伊先生的
To the lawyer cline and you, mr. Mccoy.

646
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:51,519
"我的名字是纳特・哈特菲尔德"
"My name is nat hatfield."

647
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:54,659
"我不是一个人在战斗"
"I am not one individual but many."

648
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:59,059
"在此警告"
This is as good as a confession.

649
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:02,099
"如果你们闯入我们的领地"
"We hereby notify you that if you invade our state

650
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,379
"抓捕或杀害任何一个哈特菲尔德人"
"To take or kill hatfields, "

651
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:06,869
"我们将追查到底"
"we will charge it to you."

652
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,639
"要你们血债血偿"
"Your hides will pay the penalty."

653
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:16,179
恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德威胁要杀死我们
devil anse hatfield is threatening to kill us,

654
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:17,649
就像他对这些人所做的一样
Like he done these men.

655
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:21,489
有书信为证
We got it in writing.

656
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:24,559
我们需要您的帮助 米勒先生
We appreciate your help, mr. Miller.

657
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:28,429
让我先把这些马交给警长大人
let me get these horses over to the sheriff.

658
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,679
嘿 科顿 再给我们拿一瓶
hey, cotton, give us another bottle.

659
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:56,319
科顿 再来一瓶
Cotton, give us a bottle.

660
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:08,899
我非常爱约翰斯・哈特菲尔德
I love johnse hatfield so much.

661
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,999
他怎么就看不到呢?
Why don't he see that?

662
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:13,399
因为你是个婊子
on account of you're a whore.

663
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:16,069
那也比麦考伊家的婊子强
better than some mccoy bitch.

664
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,749
盖 把威士忌放下
cap, put down the whiskey,

665
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:33,989
假装需要解手
Make like nature calls.

666
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:37,059
明白了吗?
Get my drift.?

667
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:43,359
好了 我去解个手
all right, I'm gonna find me a tree to water.

668
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:48,939

00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,169
你知道吗 我认识这个家伙已经三十年了
You know, I knew this boy once 30 years ago.

670
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,509
他可以把手放在火上
Could hold his hand over that fire

671
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:56,579
整整两分钟 都不怕疼
For two minutes and take the pain.

672
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,009
你知道他是谁吗 淡毛科顿?
Do you know who that boy was, cotton top?

673
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,849
就是你的叔叔 老吉姆・万斯
That was your old uncle jim vance.

674
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:04,649
不是吧

是的 不骗你

威廉 "盖" 哈特菲尔德

677
00:53:16,899 --> 00:53:18,429
什么事?

678
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,829
把裤子系上 你个下流胚
button your dick, you vulgar bastard.

679
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:22,709
我正式逮捕你 
I'm arresting you

680
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:24,899
因为你涉嫌谋杀托尔伯特 费默尔和...

681
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:44,289

689
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,829
一百码外的物体 
You shoot a target at 100 yards,

690
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:39,009
射起来就跟二十五码外的一样容易
makes it the same as 25.

691
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,809
开玩笑吧?

692
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:43,509
二十五码的距离百发百中
Hard to miss at 25 yards.

好好看看 哥们

697
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,059
的确物有所值
That is one fine purchase.

698
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,299
我计划用它来杀恶魔昂斯
I figure to use it on old devil anse.

699
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:16,739
嘿 把它给我

屏住呼吸
Don't even breathe.

你救了你爸爸一命
You saved your pappy.

711
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:06,989
我以你为豪 孩子
I'm proud of you, son.

712
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:10,229
你干得不错 孩子!
You are good, boy!

713
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:14,199
妈妈 你确定一点不吃吗?
mama, are you sure you won't eat some?

714
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:15,439
不 谢谢你 亲爱的
no, thank you, sweetheart.

715
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,139
我很好
I'm fine.

716
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,439
你有什么事情要告诉我?
there's something you've been wanting to tell me?

717
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:24,109
说吧?
What is it?

718
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:27,949
你的侄子帕里斯被杀了
your nephew parris has been killed.

719
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,179
哦 天啊
good lord.

720
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:32,889
可怜的帕里斯
Poor parris.

721
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:34,619
我们该行动起来了 兰德尔
got to do something about it, randall.

722
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:38,489
每周死去的侦探和家族成员越来越多
Got more detectives and family coming back dead every week.

723
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:40,159
你不能再畏手畏脚了
You can't keep poking a mad bear with a twig

724
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:42,129
事态只会越来越糟
And making it madder.

725
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:43,429
我们得有次大行动
We need a big stick,

726
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:45,399
得有人替我们讨回公道了
Someone prepared to execute our indictments.

727
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:47,869
爸...
pa...

728
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,699
让我去吧
Let me do it.

729
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,739
让我去收拾那些杀死我哥哥们的凶手
I'll get my brothers' killers.

730
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:54,839
我可以协助他
I'll be his right hand.

731
00:56:55,939 --> 00:56:57,479
我知道如何用枪 爸爸
I can fire a gun, pa.

732
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:58,789
我欣赏你们的勇气 孩子们 
I appreciate it, boys,

733
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,539
不过目前唯一一次
but the only success we've had

734
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,779
成功捕获逃犯
In capturing any of our fugitives

735
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,449
还是恶人弗兰克做的
Has been with bad frank.

736
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:04,519
我不喜欢那个男人
I do not like that man.

737
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:06,679
那个男人是个野蛮人
That man is a savage.

738
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,089
只有他可以胜任这个任务
he's the only one equal to the task.

739
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:12,389
这个恶人 这个野蛮人
can this bad man, the savage,

740
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:18,129
可以让我的孩子们死而复生吗?
Can he bring me my boys back?

741
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:40,219
有人来看你啦
we got a paying customer for ya.

742
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:47,519
再见 南茜小姐
Bye, miss nancy.

743
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:57,899
想要见你一面简直
easier seein' president chester a. Arthur

744
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:01,909
切斯特・艾伦・阿瑟为美国第二十一任总统

745
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:01,909
比见切斯特・艾伦・阿瑟总统还难
Than passing through these woods to get your 'shine.

746
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:07,009
你来这里做什么 南茜?
what you want, nancy?

747
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,309
给我的哥哥买一些威士忌作为生日礼物
purchasin' whiskey for my brother's birthday.

748
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,619
我听说你去过我贝蒂阿姨的家
Though I did hear you paid a visit to my aunt betty.

749
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:21,789
我不是十分喜欢贝蒂阿姨
I don't much like aunt betty.

750
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:26,159
你什么时候才能不试着笼络我的亲戚们?
when you gonna stop tryin' to win over my relations?

751
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:29,969
我只关心一个人
only one I care about,

752
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:33,639
你的堂妹罗斯安娜 我孩子的妈妈
Your cousin roseanna, mother of my baby.

753
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:40,109
小萨拉・伊丽莎白体弱多病
little sarah elizabeth is frail and ailing,

754
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:42,539
罗斯安娜也是如此
And so is roseanna.

755
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,749
他们说孩子活不了多久了
Folks don't expect the child to live much longer.

756
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:49,379
我真的很抱歉 约翰斯
I'm truly sorry, johnse.

757
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:52,319
如果失去孩子 恐怕你也会失去罗斯安娜
Without the baby, I fear you'll lose roseanna too.

758
00:58:53,919 --> 00:58:58,419
在经历这些种种以后 我...
After all that happened, I...

759
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,289
似乎她也不愿意再见你了
It seems like she don't want you anymore.

760
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:11,899
我到底应该怎么做?
what am I supposed to do?

761
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:16,339
你不应该承受这些痛苦的 约翰斯
you don't deserve these hard times, johnse.

762
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:20,109
你真的不应受这些
You truly don't.

763
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:43,939
哈!
hah!

764
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,169
吁 吁 吁
Ho, ho, ho.

765
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:53,709
治安法官

766
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:53,709
女士请...
My lady...

767
00:59:58,889 --> 01:00:00,849
沃尔叔叔
Uncle wall,

768
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:02,619
希望您能批准我和南茜・麦考伊
I'd like you to marry us,

769
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:05,989
结为夫妻
Me and nancy mccoy.

770
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:14,169
万能的上帝啊 孩子
Jesus h. Christ almighty, boy.

771
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:16,669
你彻底疯了吗?
You gone plumb crazy?

772
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,499
不 我没疯
no, sir.

773
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:26,539
另一个怀着你孩子的麦考伊家的女人怎么办?
what about the mccoy woman you already knocked up?

774
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:31,979
毋庸置疑 那是一段不堪回首的往事
yes, sir, well, that is a sad chapter.

775
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,019
虽然不是我所愿...
That seems over with...roseanna,

776
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:36,719
但我和罗斯安娜似乎已经结束了
though, not by my choosin'.

777
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:39,959
但南茜的情况就截然不同
You know, it's different with nancy.

778
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:43,559
没人会反对
There ain't no one opposed.

779
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:46,959
你父母知道吗?
Do your ma and pa know?

780
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:49,469
这回我不会再询问他们的意见了
You know, I ain't askin' this time.

781
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:56,909
求您了 沃尔叔叔
Please, uncle wall.

782
01:00:58,009 --> 01:01:01,579
与麦考伊家族的联姻 对于了断
Me marrying a mccoy could help end

783
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,179
两个家族间的恩怨将会有益无害
All this dying between our families.

784
01:01:11,259 --> 01:01:13,319
根据西弗吉尼亚州赋予我的权力
By the power vested in me by the state of west virginia,

785
01:01:14,989 --> 01:01:19,229
现在我宣布你俩结成夫妇
I now pronounce you man and wife.

786
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:22,499
杰弗逊 过来把这个签了
Jefferson, come over here and sign this thing.

787
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:24,199
签在这
Right there.

788
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:26,399
让我来
Let me sign.

789
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,869
闭嘴
Shut up.

790
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:35,909
你真的要这样做吗 姐姐?
You sure you want to do this, sis?

791
01:01:35,979 --> 01:01:37,139
小姐 笑一下吧
Smile, little lady.

792
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:39,209
今天是你大喜之日
It's your wedding day.

793
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:44,379
我们现在是夫妻了
Man and wife now.

794
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:48,919
希望我们能永远相濡以沫
And I expect no more trouble between us, not ever.

795
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:55,759
我真心希望你知道自己在干嘛 孩子
I sure hope you know what you're doin', boy.

796
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:58,669
我不知道这事要怎么开口 但我还是得说
I don't know how to tell y'all this but just say it.

797
01:01:58,729 --> 01:02:02,399
有话直说 沃尔
Just come on out with it, wall.

798
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,169
昨天我批准了约翰斯与南茜的婚事
Yesterday I married johnse and nancy mccoy.

799
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:09,409
什么?
What?

800
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:11,609
你批准了?
You married 'em?

801
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:13,249
其实我真的很不情愿
Well, it was damn sure reluctantly.

802
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:16,179
这点我可以向你们表明
I can tell you that.

803
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:18,219
哈蒙・麦考伊的女儿?
Harmon mccoy's daughter?

804
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:22,789
哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

805
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,159
上次我们没答应他就没结成
Well, he was lookin' to be lost to us.

806
01:02:25,259 --> 01:02:27,229
这回 他成功了
This time, he just may have succeeded.

807
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:28,599
昂斯 他认为这种方式
Well, anse, he thinks it'll make peace

808
01:02:28,659 --> 01:02:30,099
可以化解你与兰德尔之间的恩怨
Between you and randall.

809
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:31,459
是吗?
He does, huh?

810
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:33,499
有谁可以告诉我 我的儿子是怎么
Somebody want to tell me how a son of mine

811
01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:35,839
会他妈的变成一个白痴的?
Could turn out to be so goddamn dumb?

812
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:43,039
盖
Cap.

813
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:44,909
什么事?
Yeah?

814
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:46,809
骑上你的马
Get your horse.

815
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:48,209
去把你哥带回来
Go fetch your brother.

816
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:53,949
不管你怎么加强这个地方的防卫 昂斯
No matter how you fortify it, anse,

817
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:56,989
这里离拖轮河太近 而且毫无遮掩
This place is too close to the tug and open to attack.

818
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:58,559
只要那个该死的佩里・克莱因
As long as that peckerwood perry cline

819
01:02:58,659 --> 01:02:59,889
不断增加悬赏金
keeps putting up bounties,

820
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:01,429
贪婪之士就会纷拥而至
the wolves are just gonna keep on comin'.

821
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,629
沃尔 看来得告诉肯塔基州的人
Oh, wall, I think we sent kentucky a notion

822
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:05,429
我们是如何处置这些赏金猎手的
of how we deal with bounty hunters.

823
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:07,169
去你的 吉姆
Damn it, jim.

824
01:03:07,229 --> 01:03:08,899
我是说你们最好躲在深山老林里
All I'm sayin' is, y'all would be better off

825
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,769
别惹是生非了
Deeper in the mountains.

826
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:13,769
安全为重 昂斯
Just to be safe, anse.

827
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:18,779
知道了 我会按你的意思来 沃尔
Well, I'll take it under advisement, wall.

828
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:21,879
别让约翰斯把那个麦考伊的贱人一起带来
And don't you let johnse bring his new mccoy hussy with him.

829
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:24,479
我会把他带回来的 妈妈
I'll bring him home, mama.

830
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:04,219
你在跟我做那事的时候
When you do the trick with me,

831
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,789
你是不是幻想着罗斯安娜?
Are you picturing roseanna?

832
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:13,159
我试着不去想
Tryin' not to.

833
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:16,859
但依然无法抹去?
Tryin' but failin'?

834
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:21,639
我想我需要更多的时间
I need more time, I guess.

835
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:25,539
我等你 约翰斯
I'll give you time, johnse.

836
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:28,539
为了得到我想要的东西我可以等很久
I can wait a long time for what I want.

837
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,549
里面到底有没有人?
Anybody the hell in there?

838
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:33,709
那是我弟弟
That's my brother.

839
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:36,519
杰弗逊
Jefferson.

840
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:39,589
你得把我藏起来
You got to hide me.

841
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,059
我们为什么要这样做?
Why we got to do that?

842
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:43,459
不能让他们把我绞死 姐姐
Can't let me hang, sis,

843
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,289
我完全不记得我打过一场架
Not for no fight that I can't even remembers,

844
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,029
我当时醉了
'cause I was drunk

845
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:49,099
我对不起可怜的弗雷德・沃尔福德
And feels terrible about poor fred wolford.

846
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,899
弗雷德・沃尔福德?
Fred wolford?

847
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:52,199
那个邮递员
The mailman.

848
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:53,799
我们在一个谷仓舞会
We was at a barn dance,

849
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:56,899
喝酒 争论 回敬对方
Drinking, arguing, went out back,

850
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:59,709
然后就是一场混战
Commenced to scuffle.

851
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:01,309
我只是...我只是用刀稍微划了他一下
I just give him...I give him a little cut,

852
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:02,739
他却要开枪毙了我
And he tried to shoot me.

853
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:04,149
于是我就把枪转了个方向
So I wrenched that gun around,

854
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:06,249
让他朝自己开了一枪
And I made him shoot his own damn self.

855
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:08,319
惨了
Oh, hell.

856
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:11,249
今早他人就死了
He died this morning.

857
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:12,549
现在他们在到处找我
Now they all out there looking for me.

858
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:14,219
还悬了赏
They got a reward out.

859
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:15,859
过来 弟弟
Come here, brother.

860
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,159
你会没事的
You gonna be all right.

861
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,799
好吧
All right.

862
01:05:20,899 --> 01:05:24,069
留下来吃饭吧 你今晚可以在这里过夜
We'll feed you. You can spend the night here.

863
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:26,669
杰弗逊 没人会找到这里
You're gonna be safe here, jefferson.

864
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:29,399
就一晚
For the night.

865
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:33,739
只要我在这他就可以待在这
As long as I'm here.

866
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,469
现在的我 
I don't look like

867
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:00,029
已经不像当初和约翰斯在一起的我了
the girl johnse romanced no more.

868
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:06,699
我现在这个样子他还会要我吗?
Will he still want me lookin' like this?

869
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:08,739
现在才来担心这个 为时已晚
Too late to worry about that.

870
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,509
我本不想趟这趟浑水
I didn't want to stir the pot,

871
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,679
但你应该知道
But here it is.

872
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:24,119
约翰斯一走了之还结了婚
Johnse's gone and got himself married

873
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:27,229
跟你堂姐南茜
To your cousin nancy.

874
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:33,129
你听到我说的话吗?
Did you hear me?

875
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:34,529
约翰斯・哈特菲尔德
Johnse Hatfield

876
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:39,339
娶了南茜・麦考伊
Married nancy mccoy.

877
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:50,379
菲利普斯先生 很高兴见到你
mr. Phillips, good to see you.

878
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:52,979
我也很高兴见到你俩
Equally good to see the two of you.

879
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:54,689
你应该知道今早我为什么
Expect you know why I called this meeting

880
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,189
要在这里举行这个会议
here this morning.

881
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:58,449
你们在找解决河对岸事务
Y'all are lookin' for someone to lead a posse

882
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,159
的武装队队长
across the river,

883
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:01,819
而我是这方圆几十里唯一的职业杀手
And I'm the only gun handler around here

884
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,589
没有人能比我更胜任这份工作了
Who's man enough for the job.

885
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:07,729
为此你感到罪孽深重 不是吗?
You're awful full of yourself, ain't ya?

886
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:11,169
我不会这么认为
I wouldn't call it that.

887
01:07:11,229 --> 01:07:14,139
在虚度光阴的少年时代
I wasted some years of my misspent youth

888
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,569
我曾跟着杰西和弗兰克跑来跑去
A'ridin' with jesse and frank.

889
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:19,909
有次我亲眼看见疯子比尔杀人
Once got to witness wild bill kill a man,

890
01:07:19,979 --> 01:07:21,339
所以我见过更好的
So I seen better than me,

891
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:24,849
不过不多
Though not many.

892
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,149
况且你们选谁也不是我能决定的
And I can't help but see what you got to choose from.

893
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:33,359
我不知道你还有段无法无天的过去
I didn't realize you'd once been an outlaw.

894
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:35,589
哦 你当然不知道 那都是我被救之前的事了
Oh, that, of course, was before I was saved,

895
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:39,629
依靠耶和华的圣血和救世主的宽恕
Long prior to my being washed clean of sin

896
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:43,469
一直以来我都在清洗我曾经的罪孽
By the blood of our lord and savior jesus christ.

897
01:07:44,529 --> 01:07:47,439
你的行为可不是基督徒风范
You sure don't act christian.

898
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:51,309
我是上帝的战士 麦考伊先生
I'm a warrior for god, mr. Mccoy,

899
01:07:51,409 --> 01:07:54,339
邪恶战士
A fighter of evil,

900
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:57,349
我时刻准备着为你们捉拿那些可恨的杀人犯
Right and ready to take on your demon murderers.

901
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,349
我听说你还是个私家侦探
I heard you were a pinkerton man.

902
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:03,419
曾经是
I was,

903
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:05,749
直到哈特菲尔德家的人暗地里朝我开了一枪
Till I got shot in the back by hatfields,

904
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:09,019
我就成了瘸子
Left me with my limp,

905
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,989
这是另一个我渴望得到这份工作的原因
Another reason that warrants my hiring.

906
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,289
我个人也对恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德
I bear devil anse hatfield

907
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:18,269
和他的所有血亲心存怨恨
and all his kin a personal grudge.

908
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:37,189
让我把这理清了
Now, let me get this straight.

909
01:08:37,289 --> 01:08:39,269
兰德尔想通过他们的州长 
Now, randall wants his governor

910
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:40,919
让我们的州长逮捕我们
to make our governor arrest us

911
01:08:41,019 --> 01:08:42,519
再把我们交给肯塔基州处置?
And cart us over to kentucky?

912
01:08:42,629 --> 01:08:44,089
这叫引渡 伊莱亚斯
It's called extradition, elias,

913
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:48,459
我不相信我们的威尔逊州长会同意
And I don't think our governor wilson will agree to it.

914
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:50,529
在这场游戏中我还握着一张王牌
well, I got my own ace in this poker game.

915
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:52,189
我的老友约翰・弗洛伊德
My friend john floyd

916
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:53,599
现在在首都与文迪共事
works with windy at the capital now.

917
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:57,569
我们的新任助理国务卿
Yes, sir, our new assistant secretary of state.

918
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:59,109
约翰可以帮忙搞定
John will help out.

919
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:01,209
是盖和约翰斯
It's cap and johnse.

920
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:04,679
这孩子我们该怎么办 莉瓦西?
How do we handle this boy, 'vicy?

921
01:09:04,749 --> 01:09:08,849
总不能牛不喝水强按头
Well, not by pushin' and pullin' him.

922
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:12,649
正因如此他才会投入另一个麦考伊女人的怀抱
That's what drove him into the arms of another mccoy.

923
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:18,229
你想解开这个结...
You want to untie this knot...

924
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:20,499
你就得让她恨他
You get her to hate him.

925
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:37,879
进屋就把帽子脱了
Take your hat off in here.

926
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:46,449
嗯...做丈夫感觉怎样?
So... how's the married man?

927
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:50,059
还过得去 沃尔叔叔 还行
Doin' just fine, uncle wall, just fine.

928
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:52,229
婚姻生活还是挺适合你嘛
So marriage suits you then, huh?

929
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:53,889
是啊 适合极了
Yes, sir, right down to the ground.

930
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:58,229
她做饭肯定不咋地
She must be one sorry-ass cook.

931
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,269
你选了个中看不中用的麦考伊新娘
You choosin' a ham supper over a comely mccoy bride.

932
01:10:02,339 --> 01:10:03,799
她不再姓麦考伊 
She ain't mccoy no more, is she?

933
01:10:03,869 --> 01:10:07,109
她姓哈特菲尔德 约翰斯・哈特菲尔德太太
She's hatfield, mrs. Johnse hatfield.

934
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:10,209
哈特菲尔德不仅仅是一个名字
Hatfield ain't just a name on a piece of paper.

935
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:14,409
别妄想像上次那个女孩那样把她带过来 
Don't expect to bring her around here like the last one.

936
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,409
有些事不能被麦考伊家的人听到	
Things get spoke that ain't for mccoy ears.

937
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:18,319
我这不没把她带来吗?
Well, I didn't bring her here, did I?

938
01:10:18,419 --> 01:10:19,919
不准对你父亲无礼
Don't sass your father.

939
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:20,619
你那浪荡的性情
Your horndog philanderin'

940
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:21,889
也为如今的混乱局面出了一份力
helped make this mess.

941
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:24,259
妈妈 求您别说了 在家时我已经受够气了
mama, please, you know what? I get enough grief at home.

942
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,529
说真的 我得出来透透气
Truth be told, I need to get away for a bit.

943
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:31,399
不是她的原因
It ain't her, you know.

944
01:10:31,499 --> 01:10:32,859
南茜待我挺好的
Nancy treats me fine.

945
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,869
只是...
It's just...

946
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:38,899
她那该死的弟弟把我的蜜月搅合成了一场噩梦
Her gol'dang brother is turning my honeymoon into misery.

947
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:41,139
杰弗逊・麦考伊?
jefferson mccoy?

948
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:42,969
我听说他那天干掉了一个邮递员
I heard he killed the mailman the other day.

949
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:44,779
还设了悬赏金呢
Got a gol'dang reward up too.

950
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:51,079
你收留了一个被通缉的麦考伊家的人?
You're harborin' a mccoy with a price on his head?

951
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,519
南茜说是暂时的
Nancy says it's just for a while,

952
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:57,289
还说自己有保护他的义务
Says it's her duty to protect him.

953
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,319
这姐姐不错
Well, loyal sis.

954
01:11:00,429 --> 01:11:02,089
赏金有多少?
How much is the reward?

955
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,889
不知道
I don't know.

956
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:06,729
一百美元吧
$100 maybe.

957
01:11:06,799 --> 01:11:10,529
孩子 我们只想你幸福
Well, we just want you to be happy, son.

958
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:17,839
要不你离开家一段时间吧 好吗?
Why don't you take a little time away from home, hmm?

959
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:20,279
对谁都好
Wouldn't hurt none.

960
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:23,809
跟你爸爸出去打打猎
Go huntin' with your pa.

961
01:11:26,519 --> 01:11:29,279
那倒是真的 我也挺久没打猎了
It's true. I ain't been huntin' for a spell.

962
01:11:31,249 --> 01:11:32,989
你有兴趣跟我一起去吗 约翰斯?
You up to goin' with me, johnse?

963
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,519
听上去不错
That'd be nice.

964
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:37,029
我不确定 可能会去吧
I don't know. Yeah, might as well.

965
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:41,129
该死 总比看着我的懒汉小舅子
Shit, better than watching my layabout brother-in-law

966
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,659
喝光我的威士忌好 对吧?
Drink up all my whiskey profits, right?

967
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,269
赞成
Amen to that.

968
01:12:10,889 --> 01:12:13,629
我想你就是杰弗逊・麦考伊
I believe that's a jefferson mccoy.

969
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,729
谁在说话?
who's sayin' that?

970
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:19,969
约翰斯・哈特菲尔德的叔叔吉姆・万斯
Johnse hatfield's uncle jim vance

971
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:22,669
还有他的弟弟盖
And his little brother cap.

972
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,639
在哪...约翰斯在哪里?
where's...where's johnse?

973
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,879
跟他的爸爸打猎去了
out huntin' with his pa.

974
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,579
你们来干嘛?
so what you doin' here?

975
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:35,849
我们也来打点猎
Doin' a little hunting ourselves.

976
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:39,519
呃...这附近并没有什么猎物 
well... not much huntin' around here.

977
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:44,259
这个地方的鹿什么的全都被打光了
Place is all shot out of deer and such.

978
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:49,759
哦 这里还是有一些小畜生的
oh, there's still critters here.

979
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:52,999
特别是有一个小畜生
And one critter in particular

980
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:55,699
顶着一个价值可观的脑袋
Has a handsome reward on his head.

981
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:00,469
南茜!
nancy!

982
01:13:00,539 --> 01:13:02,039
你们对我弟弟做了什么?
what are you doing to my brother?

983
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:03,639
南茜, 救我! 他们要把我抓起来
nancy, do something! They gonna take me in!

984
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:05,209
放开他!

01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,029
我投降 我乖乖跟你走
I give up. You got me dead to rights.

1127
01:21:59,129 --> 01:22:00,799
一个能杀死自己堂兄弟的人
a man who'd shoot his own cousins,

1128
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:02,759
我可不信他会乖乖被我们活捉
I don't expect he'd let himself get taken alive.

1129
01:22:02,869 --> 01:22:04,369
你就继续演吧
Make your play.

1130
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:05,769
我没带枪
I ain't wearin' no gun.

1131
01:22:05,869 --> 01:22:07,469
我手举高
My hands are up.

1132
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:10,409
我不会剥夺一个人自我防卫的权利
I won't deny a man his right to defend hisself.

1133
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,169
我数到五 你就去死吧
I'll count to five, and you go for it.

1134
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,479
一 二...
One, two...

1135
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:14,979
亚伦 你告诉他我投降了!
aaron, you tell him I'll surrender!

1136
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,309
三
three.

1137
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:17,749
我趴下
I'm gettin' down on the floor.

1138
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,079
我没用 我投降
I'm helpless. I surrender.

1139
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:21,579
这里有目击者
You got a witness right there.

1140
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,319
他知道我已经投降了
He knows I give myself up.

1141
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:25,889
加略人犹大出卖了耶稣

1142
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:25,889
是的 真实的加略人犹大
yeah, real-life judas iscariot.

1143
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:27,359
别开枪 先生
don't do it, mister.

1144
01:22:27,419 --> 01:22:28,659
这是不对的
It ain't right.

1145
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:31,459
也许你是对的
maybe you're right.

1146
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,329
他也许还不值一颗子弹的钱
Maybe he ain't worth the price of a bullet.

1147
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,159
是的 我不值 先生
That's right. No, sir.

1148
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:51,309
出击吧 盖
hit me, cap.

1149
01:22:51,409 --> 01:22:53,779
哦
Ooh.

1150
01:22:53,879 --> 01:22:54,909
是我
it's me.

1151
01:22:54,979 --> 01:22:56,149
把这该死的门打开
Open the damn door.

1152
01:22:56,249 --> 01:22:58,949
他一个人
he's alone.

1153
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,989
嘿 甜心
hey, sugar.

1154
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:18,039
你疯了吗 孩子?
you insane, boy?

1155
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:20,309
干得好 约翰斯 别停手
that's right, johnse. Don't give up.

1156
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,169
喔
Whoa.

1157
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,109
加油 约翰斯
Come on, johnse.

1158
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:28,949
- 好! - 你闭嘴
- yeah! - you shut up.

1159
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:34,649
你为什么要那样做 吉姆叔叔?
why'd you do it, uncle jim?

1160
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,049
我他妈到底做了什么? 什么?
what the hell? Do what?

1161
01:23:41,089 --> 01:23:42,889
快上 盖
get your money, cap.

1162
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:44,829
把他们拉开
let's get 'em.

1163
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:46,699
够了 住手
all right, now.

1164
01:23:46,799 --> 01:23:48,629
放开他
Get off him.

1165
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:57,539
我要宰了你!
I'm gonna kill you!

1166
01:23:57,639 --> 01:23:59,009
你个魔鬼!
You monster!

1167
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:03,579
南茜说你他妈的差点强暴了她!
Nancy says you damn near raped her!

1168
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:04,809
她胡说!
that's a lie!

1169
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:06,549
是那个婊子先冲过来的
That bitch came at me first.

1170
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:08,619
你说的是我妻子 嘴巴放干净点
that's my wife you're talking about, god damn it.

1171
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:10,119
约翰斯 坐下
johnse, sit down.

1172
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:11,349
你喝高了
You're drunk.

1173
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:13,219
来 坐下
Sit, sit.

1174
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:19,929
也只有喝多了 我才有勇气来这里
the only way I could come here was liquored up.

1175
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:23,069
你以为我他妈愿意这样对待我的家人
I hate goin' up against my family like this.

1176
01:24:23,129 --> 01:24:25,099
吉姆叔叔说的对 是南茜先动手的
uncle jim's right about nancy comin' after him.

1177
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,999
他先拿起牛鞭打他的
She started whippin' him with a cow's tail.

1178
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:29,539
她差点弄瞎我的眼睛
pret'near took my eye out, she did.

1179
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:34,279
为了保命 我才不得已夺下她的鞭子
I had to jerk that thing out of her hand to save myself.

1180
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:36,279
抱歉 约翰斯
I'm sorry, johnse.

1181
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:40,819
好吧...你知道的
Well...you know.

1182
01:24:40,879 --> 01:24:43,819
你听说塞尔柯克的事了吗?
you hear about selkirk?

1183
01:24:43,889 --> 01:24:47,659
那个恶人弗兰克把他送进了派克维尔监狱
That bad frank prick hauled him off to pikeville jail.

1184
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:51,589
他是怎么知道他藏身之处的 约翰斯?
how did he know where he was, johnse?

1185
01:24:51,699 --> 01:24:53,829
塞尔柯克已经隐姓埋名了
Selkirk was incognito.

1186
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:57,269
只有哈特菲尔德的人才知道他在哪
Only us hatfields knew where he was.

1187
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:04,309
我是个不折不扣的哈特菲尔德人
I am foursquare hatfield,

1188
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:06,679
从身到心 从生至死
Front and back, dawn to dusk.

1189
01:25:14,179 --> 01:25:18,819
是啊 所以脾气那么暴躁
yeah, well, that's why emotions are runnin' so wild,

1190
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:23,619
我们中间有奸细
Because there's a spy amongst us.

1191
01:25:34,269 --> 01:25:35,999
吁
whoa.

1192
01:25:36,099 --> 01:25:38,499
文件通过了
Papers come through.

1193
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:41,369
官方文件
It's official.

1194
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:43,939
嗯
Mmn

1195
01:25:44,009 --> 01:25:46,809
"肯塔基州 特别代表"
"Special deputy, state of kentucky,"

1196
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:49,009
"弗兰克・菲利普斯先生"
"Mr. Frank phillips."

1197
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:51,519
州长西蒙・巴克纳寄
Sent by governor simon buckner.

1198
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,719
你应该很高兴吧 菲利普斯先生
you should be very pleased, mr. Phillips.

1199
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:04,859
各位 如果遇到反击
Men, should you meet resistance,

1200
01:26:04,929 --> 01:26:08,169
不到必要的时候 不要动用武力
You'll use no more force than is necessary to prevail.

1201
01:26:08,269 --> 01:26:11,339
毕竟我们不是哈特菲尔德那样的异教徒
We are not infidels like the hatfields.

1202
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:15,369
我们要依法行事
We embody the law.

1203
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:16,709
我们来祈祷
Let us pray.

1204
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,549
亲爱的上帝
Dear lord,

1205
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:25,179
愿您与我们同在 保佑我们的勇士
May you be with us today and bless our endeavors.

1206
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:29,989
阿门
Amen.

1207
01:26:33,129 --> 01:26:34,929
多年前 是你带领大家
years past, you'd have lead the charge

1208
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:36,759
收拾了烂摊子
And fixed this mess yourself.

1209
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,129
现在 还是让我们年轻人来做吧
Today you best leave it to the younger men.

1210
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,569
他杀死了我的儿子们
he killed my boys.

1211
01:26:42,669 --> 01:26:43,999
这是我的战斗
This is my fight.

1212
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:46,869
你的儿子们可以代替你
your sons can ride in your stead.

1213
01:26:46,939 --> 01:26:50,939
体体面面地 麦考伊先生 卸任吧
With dignified regard, mr. Mccoy, you ain't deputized.

1214
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,839
他说的对 兰德尔
he's right, randall.

1215
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:57,379
你总是坚持要依法行事
You're the one who insists this all be legal.

1216
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,949
好吧
yah.

1217
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:07,229
我们出发!
let's ride!

1218
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:33,959
孩子们不会有事的
our boys will be fine.

1219
01:27:34,059 --> 01:27:35,729
我以为你会和他们一起去
I thought you were goin' off with 'em.

1220
01:27:35,799 --> 01:27:40,799
嗯 他们觉得我老了 不中用了
mm, they reckon I'm too old and shaky.

1221
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:44,869
会他们拖后腿
I'd slow 'em down.

1222
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:49,879
他们还年轻
They're young men.

1223
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:51,979
我们祈祷他们平安吧
We should pray for their safety.

1224
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,409
你还没厌倦祈祷这回事吗 兰德尔?
you ever get tired of praying, randall?

1225
01:27:56,519 --> 01:27:58,919
好像也很少管用
Seems like it so rarely works.

1226
01:27:59,019 --> 01:28:02,319
我们不应该怀疑上帝的旨意
it's not ours to question god's will.

1227
01:28:02,419 --> 01:28:06,589
我们应该信仰上帝的旨意
That's what faith's for.

1228
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:09,529
不要害怕 孩子他妈
Don't be fearful, mother.

1229
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:14,999
林子一片漆黑的时候真是渗人
gets awful dark in these woods at night.

1230
01:28:15,099 --> 01:28:17,099
我们可以用一些托马斯・爱迪生发明的
We could use some of tom edison's

1231
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,739
电灯泡
Electric lightnin' bulbs.

1232
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:25,309
我想给你的太多
there's so much I wanted to give you,

1233
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:29,809
太多 莎莉
So much, sally.

1234
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:32,649
但是此生带给你的却只有痛苦
But all I brought you is pain in this life.

1235
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:35,589
是其他人造成的 不是你
others have, but not you.

1236
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:45,959
你总是相信一切你所说 兰德尔
You always believe what you say, randall.

1237
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:49,399
难得的品质 我欣赏你这一点
That is a rare quality, and I admire you for it.

1238
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:55,139
这就是你嫁给我的原因吗?
that why you married me?

1239
01:28:57,139 --> 01:28:58,809
我嫁给你 是因为有一天
I married you, because one day,

1240
01:28:58,879 --> 01:29:01,879
你会给我买那个双层电锅
You're gonna buy me that electric double boiler.

1241
01:29:16,589 --> 01:29:19,959
守卫去哪了?
where's the guards?

1242
01:29:20,059 --> 01:29:21,129
不知道
I don't know.

1243
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:23,429
或许在等着伏击我们呢
Maybe waiting to ambush us.

1244
01:29:56,999 --> 01:29:59,399
一个人都没有 菲利普斯先生
there ain't nobody here, mr. Phillips.

1245
01:29:59,469 --> 01:30:03,039
食物还在炉子上 桌子上还摆着盘子
food on the stove, plates on the table.

1246
01:30:03,099 --> 01:30:04,939
我们等他们回来吧
Let's wait till they get back.

1247
01:30:05,009 --> 01:30:08,209
恶魔他不会回来了
devil ain't comin' back.

1248
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:12,949
听到我们要来的风声 早躲到深山里去了
Heard us comin' and gone deep in the hills.

1249
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:15,919
除非在他逃跑路上抓住他
Least we got him on the run.

1250
01:30:22,259 --> 01:30:26,729
现在 我们得去抓别的人
Now, we got others to go fetch.

1251
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:44,139
起床了 弗伦奇 你个懒货
Wake up, frenchy, you lazy son of a bitch.

1252
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:47,009
别踢我 拉克 贱人
don't kick me, lark, you asshole.

1253
01:31:00,129 --> 01:31:01,859

弗伦奇・埃利斯!

1255
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:05,759
快点滚出来!
Come on outside!

1256
01:31:05,869 --> 01:31:08,399
就留你们一条狗命!
We'll give you one chance!

1257
01:31:08,499 --> 01:31:09,899
你是谁?
well, who are you?

1258
01:31:09,929 --> 01:31:12,429
派克县的代理执法官!
Deputy marshals out of pike county!

1259
01:31:09,929 --> 01:31:12,429
派克县位于肯塔基州 南界西维吉尼亚州

1260
01:31:13,499 --> 01:31:15,829
我们手握逮捕令!
We got warrants!

1261
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:20,169
放下武器 举手投降!
Toss out your guns and come on out!

1262
01:31:30,519 --> 01:31:33,119
我们在追捕恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德!
We're lookin' for Devil Anse Hatfield!

1263
01:31:33,219 --> 01:31:36,519
你们这些蠢货知不知道他在哪里?
Either one of you mush-heads know where he went to?

1264
01:31:36,619 --> 01:31:38,319
嘿 是你么 兰塞姆・布雷?
Hey, that you, Ransom Bray?

1265
01:31:38,419 --> 01:31:40,389
嘿 我认识你!
Hey, I know you!

1266
01:31:40,489 --> 01:31:42,589
上次把你妹妹露丝安妮背回家的
Yeah, I'm friends with the fella that's humpin' your sister

1267
01:31:42,689 --> 01:31:43,859
那个哥们是我朋友!
Ruth-Anne back home!

1268
01:31:47,629 --> 01:31:49,029
我本来想亲自照顾她的
Thought maybe I'd look her up myself,

1269
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:51,169
但是路途实在过于遥远!
but the line's too long!

1270
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:54,869
啊!
Ah!

1271
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:02,709
我想他们打中我了 弗伦奇
I think they killed me, frenchy.

1272
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,209
我...我中枪了
I'm g... I'm gutshot.

1273
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:05,979
告诉我们哈特菲尔德一伙逃向哪里
Tell us where the Hatfields run off to,

1274
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:07,119
就放你们一马!
and we'll spare you!

1275
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:08,989
- 嘿 拉克 - 快点投降!
- Hey, Lark. - Come on out!

1276
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:10,719
他们打中我了 弗伦奇
They shot me, frenchy.

1277
01:32:10,819 --> 01:32:11,989
坚持住 喝点这个
Come on. Drink some of this.

1278
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,729
我会陪在你身边的 拉克
You got to stay with me, Lark.

1279
01:32:20,959 --> 01:32:23,129
我会带你逃出去的
Okay, I'm freightin' you out.

1280
01:32:23,229 --> 01:32:24,269
- 好的 - 好吗?
- Okay. - Okay?

1281
01:32:24,369 --> 01:32:26,139
好的
Okay.

1282
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,869
你掩护我 然后我趁机抛开
You put up a good show, and I'll make a run for it,

1283
01:32:27,969 --> 01:32:29,139
从后面包抄他们
circle behind 'em.

1284
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:32,269
- 好吗? - 好的 快点
- Okay. - Okay, come on.

1285
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:36,249
跟我来
Come on.

1286
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:37,909
好吧 我们出来了
All right, we're comin'.

1287
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:39,249
停止射击
Hold your fire.

1288
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:42,179
拉克会告诉你们有关哈特菲尔德一伙人的下落
Lark will tell you about the Hatfields.

1289
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,519
那么 你在右边吸引他们注意
All right, you break to the right,

1290
01:32:44,619 --> 01:32:49,359
我从左边跑 好吗?
and I'll go left, okay?

1291
01:33:07,579 --> 01:33:10,749
听着 我投降!
All right, I quit this fight!

1292
01:33:13,019 --> 01:33:14,379
我放下武器!
Here's my gun!

1293
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:29,899
早知道你们都会来的话
Hell, if I'd have known y'all was comin',

1294
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:31,869
我一定穿上我最好的衣服
I'd have put my Sunday best on.

1295
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:37,699
弗伦奇 你被逮捕了 因为涉嫌
French, you're under arrest for your part

1296
01:33:37,769 --> 01:33:42,439
参与谋杀兰德尔・麦考伊的儿子们
in the illegal execution of the sons of Randall McCoy.

1297
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:47,009
你是怎么认识我的妹妹露丝安妮的?
How you know my sister Ruth-Anne?

1298
01:33:47,109 --> 01:33:49,079
麦考伊兄弟们
McCoy boys.

1299
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:50,239
卡尔文 吉姆 
Calvin, Jim,

1300
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,889
看来你们都被迫卷入了你们爸爸的战争
I see y'all were takin' up your daddy's war.

1301
01:33:56,059 --> 01:33:59,129
天啊 你已经抓住亚历克斯和查理了?
Jesus, you already got Alex and Charlie?

1302
01:33:59,229 --> 01:34:01,589
另外一些人我不认识
You know, that other fella I don't recognize.

1303
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:03,929
所以你们是遇到谁就抓吗?
I mean, y'all just round up anybody you come across?

1304
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:05,359
你只需知道
All you need to know is,

1305
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:06,829
逮捕令上面有你的名字
this here warrant has your name on it.

1306
01:34:06,929 --> 01:34:09,999
好吧 看来我会被处以绞刑
Yeah, reckon I'm gonna hang,

1307
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:12,439
对于我的家族来说 将会是一个莫大的遗憾
be a big disappointment to my family.

1308
01:34:12,509 --> 01:34:14,109
直接带我们去恶魔昂斯那里
Well, take us straightaway to Devil Anse,

1309
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:16,279
你就不需要被关在笼子里面了
you won't have to ride in the cage.

1310
01:34:16,339 --> 01:34:18,379
你是怎么认识我妹妹的?
How do you know my sister?

1311
01:34:18,449 --> 01:34:21,079
去过布鲁菲尔德的人
Hell, everybody pass through bluefield

1312
01:34:21,149 --> 01:34:23,149
谁没有跟露丝安妮・布鲁做过皮肉生意呢
gets a pork job from Ruth-Anne Bray.

1313
01:34:27,889 --> 01:34:29,689
他妈的在做什么?
What the hell?

1314
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,619
他就是闭不上他的狗嘴
Made one damn remark too many.

1315
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:35,659
他要带我们去找恶魔昂斯!
He was takin' us to Devil Anse!

1316
01:34:35,729 --> 01:34:39,729
他根本不知道哈特菲尔德在哪!
He don't know where Hatfield is!

1317
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,999
弗伦奇・埃利斯就是个满口谎话的大骗子
French Ellis was always a fat liar.

1318
01:34:42,069 --> 01:34:43,499
你怎么认识他的?
How do you know him?

1319
01:34:43,599 --> 01:34:46,369
我在学校度过的唯一一年时光 他是我同学
We was in school together, the one year I went.

1320
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:52,779
我解雇白痴的方法就是
The way I fire asswipe morons is,

1321
01:34:52,809 --> 01:34:54,709
把子弹射入他们的猪脑中
I put a bullet in their goddamn heads.

1322
01:34:54,809 --> 01:34:57,109
我保证下不为例
Won't happen again.

1323
01:34:57,159 --> 01:34:58,259
抱歉
Apologize.

1324
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:04,799
我们必须立刻出发
We got to do this right.

1325
01:35:05,969 --> 01:35:07,269
谨慎行事!
Politic!

1326
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,379
不得违抗命令 听清楚了吗?
No more trail justice, you hear?

1327
01:35:14,249 --> 01:35:16,979
今天我就是警长
I might want to be sheriff one day.

1328
01:35:42,839 --> 01:35:46,279
嘿
Hey.

1329
01:35:47,379 --> 01:35:49,909
我把弹药和温切斯特步枪带来了
I picked up our ammo and our winchesters.

1330
01:35:50,019 --> 01:35:51,119
很好
Good.

1331
01:35:51,339 --> 01:35:53,039
愚蠢的麦考伊家族的人只顾着攻击推船
Dumb McCoy's raiding all the push boats;

1332
01:35:53,139 --> 01:35:54,439
却忘记了邮车这回事
Didn't think to check the mail wagon.

1333
01:35:54,509 --> 01:35:56,909
- 是的 - 是真的吗?
- Yeah. - Is it true?

1334
01:35:56,969 --> 01:35:58,509
威尔逊州长在这里?
Governor Wilson in there?

1335
01:35:58,609 --> 01:35:59,739
下一个好消息是
Next best thing.

1336
01:35:59,809 --> 01:36:02,609
他把约翰・B・弗洛伊德派来了
He sent his boy John B. Floyd.

1337
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:05,279
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1338
01:36:06,349 --> 01:36:08,519
约翰 此时此刻 我希望你能明白
John, now, I want you to understand this.

1339
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:11,919
我们目前情况是 拉克・瓦尼
Now, what we got here is Lark Varney,

1340
01:36:11,989 --> 01:36:14,219
弗伦奇・埃利斯和臭鼬头华莱士
French Ellis, Skunkhair Wallace,

1341
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:16,089
都已经死了
all of them dead.

1342
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,939
然后亚历克斯・梅塞尔 塞尔柯克...
Then we got Alex Messer, Selkirk...

1343
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,329
这些软弱的人...
pliant men...

1344
01:36:20,429 --> 01:36:22,199
大约有六个被绑架了
about a half dozen others kidnapped.

1345
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:23,769
我知道了 沃尔
I hear you, Wall.

1346
01:36:23,869 --> 01:36:25,329
真不知道我们会有多少亲属
It's hard to know how many of our relations

1347
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,259
就这样死无葬身之地
they've buried in unmarked graves.

1348
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:28,179
为什么会这样 
Why,

1349
01:36:28,179 --> 01:36:30,029
你有威尔逊州长的大力支持啊 昂斯
you have governor Wilson's complete support, Anse.

1350
01:36:30,099 --> 01:36:31,629
他已经竭尽全力了
He's doin' everything he can.

1351
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:33,269
那么 只能说他做的还不够
Well, it's pretty clear it ain't enough.

1352
01:36:33,369 --> 01:36:35,339
我已经为你们被囚禁的公民
I petitioned the U.S. district court

1353
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:38,469
向美国地方法院申请了人身保护令
for writs of habeas corpus on our imprisoned citizens.

1354
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:43,079
如今 威尔逊州长和巴克纳州长
Now, governor Wilson has had a heated exchange

1355
01:36:43,179 --> 01:36:45,249
在电报中已经激烈交锋了
of telegrams with governor Buckner.

1356
01:36:45,349 --> 01:36:46,719
激烈交锋?
Heated exchange?

1357
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,049
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1358
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:49,719
听到了吗 沃尔? 他们...
Hear that, Wall? They had a...

1359
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:52,859
他们激烈交锋了
They had themselves a heated exchange.

1360
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:54,919
嗯
Mm.

1361
01:36:54,989 --> 01:36:57,589
把边境警卫交给我 约翰
Give me troopers at the border, John,

1362
01:36:57,689 --> 01:37:00,229
边境警卫
troopers at the border,

1363
01:37:00,329 --> 01:37:01,999
那样的话 当麦考伊挑衅的话 
so when McCoy tries it again,

1364
01:37:01,999 --> 01:37:03,199
你就可以狠狠回击他了
you stop his ass.

1365
01:37:03,269 --> 01:37:08,239
约翰 约翰 这些混蛋干的都是非法的事
John, John, what these son' bitches are doin' is illegal.

1366
01:37:08,339 --> 01:37:11,309
其他州的执法官没有权力
Ain't no out-of-state lawman got the right to invade

1367
01:37:11,379 --> 01:37:13,839
入侵另一个主权州并且绑架其公民
another sovereign state to abduct citizens,

1368
01:37:13,909 --> 01:37:15,549
不管有没有该死的逮捕令
warrant or no damn warrant.

1369
01:37:15,649 --> 01:37:18,879
我向肯塔基州递交了一份官方申请书
I sent an official requisition to Kentucky

1370
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:20,779
要求逮捕弗兰克・菲利普斯
calling for the arrest of Frank Phillips

1371
01:37:20,879 --> 01:37:22,619
以及他武装队中二十三名成员
and 23 members of his posse.

1372
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:24,289
肯塔基州不会采取任何行动
Kentucky ain't gonna do nothin'.

1373
01:37:25,389 --> 01:37:28,159
但如果他们再次企图入侵西弗吉尼亚州的话
But if they try to invade West Virginia again,

1374
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:32,629
麦考伊先生手下的武装队都将被直接逮捕
Mr. McCoy's posse can be arrested here.

1375
01:37:33,729 --> 01:37:37,299
那么 被谁逮捕呢?
Mmhmm, by who?

1376
01:37:39,629 --> 01:37:42,239
该死的 快授权我们为代表
Ah, hell, deputize us.

1377
01:37:42,299 --> 01:37:44,639
给我们几门大炮 我们立刻骑马冲进派克维尔
Give us a few Cannon, we'll ride into Pikeville,

1378
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:46,369
了结这该死的一切
end this shit right now.

1379
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:49,339
先生 你所说的将挑起另一场内战
Sir, you are talkin' about startin' another civil war.

1380
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:52,809
这不仅是说说而已 约翰
That's not talk, John.

1381
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,819
这是我们下一步计划
That's what we already got.

1382
01:37:55,919 --> 01:37:58,719
请你转告州长...
So you tell the governor...

1383
01:37:58,819 --> 01:38:02,289
他不插手的话 那么就由我来代劳
He steps in, or I will.
