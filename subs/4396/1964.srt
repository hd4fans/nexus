全速前进!
Everybody get a move on!

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,650
全副武装 继续行进!
We're loading on the run!

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,750
向林木线前进!
Head for the tree line!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,430
血仇

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,180
全体后退!
Fall back!

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,620
我们务必坚守住战略高地
We'll make our stand on the ridge.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,880
后方注意隐蔽!
Cover your backs!

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,750
1863年
恶魔的骨气 - 西维吉尼亚州

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,550
冲啊!
Come on, let's go!

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,170
继续前进!
Don't stop!

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,710
敌人来了!
Here they come!

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,350
冲啊! 冲啊 前进!
Come on! Come on, let's go!

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,660
快点
Come on.

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,320
我真想把这些该死的扣子剪下来 兰德尔
I'll cut them damn buttons off, randall.

15
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,920
给你当靶子用
Makes you a target.

16
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,720
至少我晚上的时候不会挨冻
At least I can stay warm at night.

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,590
你是怎么让你的裤子不掉下来的?
How are you still keeping your britches up?

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,880
大自然补给
Nature provides.

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,730
这边走!
Over here!

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,850
寻找掩体 重新装弹!
Take cover and reload!

21
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,870
你的那条胳膊看来保不住了
You're gonna lose that arm.

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,230
如果能保命的话
I'll give the arm.

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,420
这条胳膊不要也罢
Just want to live.

24
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,340
敌人来了!
Here they come!

25
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,590
不要开枪!
Don't shoot!

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,110
停火
Hold fire.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,430
停火
Hold fire.

28
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
北方佬冲过来了
Yankee cavalry coming.

29
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,980
保留体力 全力奋战

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,150
北方佬冲过来了
Yankee cavalry coming.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
保留体力 全力奋战
Company strength.

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,330
我们可能这样完了 昂斯
This could be it, anse.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,300
最好祈求保佑吧
Best make your peace.

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,200
好吧 我以前从来没指望过上帝 兰德尔
Yeah, well, I never courted god before, randall.

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,020
我怀疑他现在不愿听我祷告
I doubt he'll hear me now.

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,840
注意左侧!
On the left!

37
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,090
注意左侧!
On the left!

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,430
这里守不住了
Can't hold this.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,750
带战士们退到防线后面
Get the boys back to the line.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,470
告诉他们把手枪留给我
Tell them to leave the pistols with me.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,390
快点起来! 撤退!
Soldier, on your feet now! Move!

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,810
我们准备撤退!
We're moving out!

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,980
大家把随身佩带的手枪
Them that's got sidearms,

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,190
放在这个麻袋里
put them in this sack here.

45
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,400
快点 撤退!
Come on, let's move!

46
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,400
快走
Go on.

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,200
我跑得比你快
I'm a faster runner than you are.

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,810
听着 昂斯
Hey, anse.

49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,750
我会为你祈祷
I'll pray for you.

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,250
我们撤退!
We're moving out!

51
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,910
给我个了结
Make it stop.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,470
让我摆脱痛苦
Make the hurt stop.

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,440
噢 噢 孩子
Oh, oh, hey.

54
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,360
让一切结束
Make it go away.

55
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,000
就这样
That's it.

56
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,080
对 很好
Yeah, that's good.

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,350
我带了点饼干和豆子回来
I'll take some of them biscuits and beans.

58
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,640
手枪还给你们
Got your sidearms back for you.

59
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,510
哦 上帝啊
Well, I'll be.

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,010
你消灭了多少北方佬 恶魔 昂斯?
How many yanks you kill, devil anse?

61
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,780
你怎么逃出来的 队长?
How'd you get away, captain?

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,900
真他妈是个奇迹
Damn miracle.

63
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,970
昂斯
Anse.

64
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,050
你在做什么?
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:52,870
我不想看着那些
Well, I ain't stayin' to watch

66
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,090
我们刚从死神手里救下来的孩子们
the boys we just saved

67
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,540
为一场注定失败的战斗而牺牲
die for a lost cause.

68
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,630
注定失败?
Lost?

69
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,900
你不会真的是这么想吧
You don't believe that.

70
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,420
确实如此
I do.

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,700
拜托 如果每个士兵自己心里都觉得
Come on, what do you think would happen

72
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,930
这场战争注定失败
if every soldier decided for himself

73
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,570
你觉得会发生什么?
when the war was lost?

74
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,840
战争将更快结束
Be shorter wars for sure.

75
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,280
不要再为此找借口了 兰德尔
Don't make a cause no better, randall,

76
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,350
好人都白白牺牲了
when good men die for it in vain.

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,610
从此刻开始 我只为自己的家人而战
From here on out, I fight only from home.

78
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,210
我们就是你的家人
We're your home.

79
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,120
你不能扭曲事实来迎合你自己
You can't just twist things to suit yourself.

80
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,720
你这是逃兵
This is desertion.

81
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,160
我可不这么认为
I don't look at it that way.

82
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,330
从我参军开始我就抛弃了我的家人
I figure I deserted my family when I signed up.

83
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,660
明智点跟我一起走
You'd be wise to come with me.

84
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,970
你发过誓的 昂斯
You took an oath, anse.

85
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,450
我们发誓要"宁死不屈"
We swore "death before dishonor."

86
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
没有什么可以改变这一事实
Nothing changes that.

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,210
万一有一天我不得不处决你呢?
What if I'm on that firing squad that has to put you down?

88
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,280
如果真有这么一天 千万不要手软
Well, if it comes to that, don't flinch.

89
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,030
这样做是不对的 我不会让你这么做的
This is wrong. I can't let you do this.

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,190
好好照顾自己 兰德尔
You take care of yourself, randall.

91
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,270
今日之恩感激不尽
Many thanks for today.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,830
上帝痛恨逃兵
God hates deserters.

93
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,080
西弗吉尼亚州 马特湾

94
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,080
你该给你的狗买杯喝的 吉姆叔叔
You ought to buy your dog a drink, uncle jim.

95
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,010
再来一点这个
And a little of this.

96
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,730
再来一点那个
And a little of that.

97
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,160
闻起来也不错 是不是?
Smell good too, don't you?

98
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,270
死狗
Damn dog.

99
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,660
你那件衣服是从北方佬尸体上扒下来的吗?
You get that coat off a dead yankee?

100
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,700
不 不是
No, I did not.

101
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,050
你在厕所里捡的吗?
You find it in an outhouse somewheres?

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,280
不 不是
No, I did not.

103
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,380
那么你从哪里弄到的?
Where'd you get it then?

104
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,970
整个叛乱期间我都穿着它
I wore it throughout the rebellion.

105
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,130
我的侄子
My nephew,

106

北方美利坚合众国(简称联邦) 南方美利坚联盟国(简称邦联)

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,740
是美利坚联盟国军队里面光荣的一员
proudly serves these here confederate states of america,

109
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,110
你的哥哥也是 兰德尔
as does your brother randall.

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,140
而你竟敢
Yet you dare come in here

111
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,080
穿着那件该死的军外套来这里
and wear that goddamned bluebottle jacket,

112
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,730
你个狗娘养的
you son of a bitch

113
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,160
这附近很多人
Near as many around these parts

114
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,690
都为了邦联战死沙场
are fighting and dying for the union.

115
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,660
对我而言 战争已然过去
As for me, war is passed,

116
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,730
而我没有其他衣服可穿
but I ain't got another jacket.

117
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,270
不过 我现在有点热
Howsomever, being as how I'm getting a little hot in here,

118
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,260
我会把衣服脱下来的
I will take it off.

119
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,690
记在账上
Put it on my charge.

120
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,250
你敢不敢把那件该死的北方佬的衣服丢在地上
You're gonna throw that damn yankee jacket on the floor,

121
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,570
然后在上面撒尿
and you're gonna piss on it.

122
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,830
我要回家了
I'm going on home.

123
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,130
不在乎这里是香是臭
Don't much care for the perfumed stank in here.

124
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,030
连酒钱都付不起
Can't even pay for your drink.

125
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
你他妈的还算什么男人?
What kind of a damn man are you?

126
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,870
如果你想找麻烦的话
The kind who, you wanna come after,

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,170
我随时奉陪 吉姆・万斯

128
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,680
我可不像你的亲戚
Unlike your kinfolk here,

129
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,180
我可不怕那些
i'm not afeard of no man

130
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,420
把自己的狗当妓女用的人
on account of he uses his dog for a whore.

131
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,470
别跟他一般见识 吉姆叔叔
Leave it now, uncle jim.

132
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,370
西弗吉尼亚州 拖轮河谷

133
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,040
你们两个兔崽子
Do you bluebellies

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
知道对付窃贼的处罚是什么吗?
know the penalty for thievery?

135
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,390
求您了 先生
Please, sir.

136
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,230
我们只是太饿了
We were just really hungry.

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,500
仅此而已
That's all.

138
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,100
求求您了 先生
Please. Please, sir.

139
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,130
我们只是...
We were just...

140
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,900
我不想听解释 一直往前走
I don't want to hear it. You just keep walking.

141
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,570
我有一个绝好的计划
I got a good plan for you boys.

142
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,210
别白费口舌了

饭桶
Git.

144
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,670
哦 天啊!
Oh, my god!

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,760
你要把他们带到哪里去 吉姆叔叔?
Where you taking 'em, uncle jim?

146
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,790
昂斯・哈特菲尔德 你回来了!
Anse Hatfield, you're back!

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,470
站住 混蛋们
Hold up, you bastards.

148
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
你这是在保卫前线呢
Guarding the home front, I see.

149
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,430
是的
Yep.

150
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,310
没有什么可以逃过老吉姆的手掌心
You know nothing gets by old jim.

151
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,150
这些北方佬偷玉米的时候被我抓个现形
I caught these yankee shit heels a'pilfering corn.

152
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,880
他想杀了你 侄子
He meant to take your life, nephew.

153
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,080
我不会这么做的 我们只是太饿了
I never. We was just hungry.

154
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,580
我在他的眼里看到了杀意
I saw murder in his eye.

155
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,610
求求您了 先生 不要杀我
Please, sir. Don'm t hit lekill me.

156
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,890
走吧 北方蠢货
On your way, yankee bill.

157
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,050
走啊
Go on.

158
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,140
是我的话早脚底抹油了
And I'd hurry it up.

159
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,280
我还以为你会放他一马
And I thought you was letting him go.

160
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,480
他也这么想
So did he.

161
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,450
在你把他一枪打得脑袋开花之后
After you blew out the other one's brainpan,

162
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,920
我还有其他选择吗?
what choice did I have?

163
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,390
确实
Yep.

164
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,620
不能留下目击证人
Don't want to leave no witnesses.

165
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,260
无所畏惧地死去
Died unafraid,

166
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,370
才是一个男人应有的死法
how a man should die.

167
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,500
真他妈的可惜
That's a damn shame.

168
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,440
那个北方小畜生本可以活下来的
That yankee piss pot should've suffered.

169
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,170
是的 但是既然你如此痛恨他们
Yeah, well, you hate 'em so much,

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,180
当初你为什么不参军呢?
how come you didn't sign up to fight 'em?

171
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,980
受命于人去战斗本身就是一种失败
Fighting on others' terms is how you lose,

172
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,250
我不能接受这种失败
and losin' is intolerable to me.

173
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,550
那么 既然我回来了 我依然还是家族掌门人
Well, I'm back now and still head of this family.

174
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,530
我无条件服从
I ain't gonna be no problem.

175
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,160
很好
Good.

176
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,630
那么我现在命令你
Then you'll understand when I tell you

177
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
把这些尸体从马路上拖走
to get these bodies off the road,

178
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,330
藏到不会被发现的地方
somewhere no one ever finds 'em.

179
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,040
是的
Yeah.

180
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,960
就和以前一样
It's gonna be like it was before.

181
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,630
看看豪尔斯先生 一直微笑着
Lookit Mr. Howls over there, all smilin'.

182
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,340
它很高兴你回来了...
He's glad you're back too...

183
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,740
一如往昔的心思缜密
With all your fine plans.

184
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,230
把尸体处理好
Get the bodies off the road.

185
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,970
你究竟在那里做什么?
What were you doing in there anyhow?

186
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,030
还没到家 就喝得满身酒气 惹是生非
Not even home yet and you get yourself into a drunken fight,

187
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,440
你个没用的蠢货
you shiftless fool.

188
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,110
我将藏匿在酿酒场
I'm hidin' out at the still

189
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,480
直至吉姆・万斯的骚动平息
till this ruckus with Jim Vance blows over.

190
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,410
你最好就喝死在那里
You'll drink yourself to death up there.

191
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,080
我不是去赴死的
I ain't going up there to die.

192
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,890
我是为了好好活着
I'm going up there to stay alive.

193
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,560
你错了
Ain't right.

194
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,360
从军队回来以后
Come home from the army,

195
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,030
把我当奶牛一样就知道让我生
breedin' me like I was cattle,

196
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,260
你现在又想一走了之吗?
then you take off again?

197
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,710
你难道忘记自己丈夫和父亲的职责了吗?
No, you've got your duties as a husband and father.

198
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,530
孩子们 我不在家你们要照顾好妈妈
Kids, mind your mama while I'm gone.

199
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,620
我们会的
We will.

200
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,330
莉瓦西
Levicy.

201
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,460
安德森?
Anderson?

202
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
我受够了战争
I'm done with the war.

203
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,130
你再也不回去了吗?
You ain't going back?

204
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,410
我已经受够了
I've given enough.

205
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,600
亲爱的 我平安回来了
I'm back for good, darling.

206
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,000
上帝保佑 你平安回来了
Lord, you lived through it.

207
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,830
我们的孩子怎么样?
How's our little boy?

208
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,110
我们的小天使入睡了
He's an angel now that he's asleep.

209
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,220
天哪 看看你
oh, my god, look at you.

210
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,880
有件事你一定得知道
You'll want to know

211
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,850
去年我们收了至少六十蒲式耳的玉米
that we got at least 60 bushels of corn in last year,

212
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,550
我们没有挨饿
so we ain't starvin',

213
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,490
今年的收成也会很不错
and this year promises to be just as good,

214
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,820
所以你不用操心
so you don't have to worry none,

215
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,040
约翰斯 还有 你绝对认不...
and johnse, you will not recog...

216
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,580
我们明早再说
We'll get to all that come morning.

217
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,980
西弗吉尼亚州 垂山

218
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,950
嘿!
Hey!

219
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,300
那不是玛莎・麦考伊吗?
Ain't that martha McCoy?

220
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,900
利亚斯替一下
'Lias.

221
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,960
麦考伊夫人
Miss McCoy.

222
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,990
你应该听说了我家哈蒙的情况
Suppose you heard about my harmon.

223
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,330
他在酿酒场待了一个多月 饮酒度日
He's up at that still over a month, drinking.

224
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,390
说万一他现在收手
Says if'n he stops now,

225
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,700
当吉姆・万斯杀上门的时候
he'll throw a fit and be helpless

226
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,940
他将既愤怒又无助
when Jim Vance come to kill him.

227
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,540
女士 不只是对我的吉姆叔叔来说
Ma'am, your yankee husband was a traitor

228
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,840
你的北方丈夫是个叛徒
to more than just my uncle jim.

229
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,510
在这的许多弟兄
There's lots of folks around here

230
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,220
都无法宽恕哈蒙的背叛行经 或许...
can't forgive harmon's betrayal and might...

231
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,420
或许他们也很想取他性命
Might want to kill him,

232
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,360
其中不乏有你的一些亲戚
even some of your own kin.

233
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,760
但哈蒙就只指控了你的吉姆・万斯叔叔
But your uncle Jim Vance is the only one my harmon accused

234
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,630
和他的猎狗通奸
of fornicating with his hound dog.

235
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,160
这个...
Well...

236
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,600
这真是低劣的用词
That's a poor choice of words.

237
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,510
找个藏身之所确实是明智的行为
I'll admit, hidin' out was prudent.

238
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,510
我不想变成一个寡妇苟活
I can't survive being a widow.

239
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,380
我叔叔总是我行我素
My uncle tends to go his own way.

240
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,250
但下次我见到他
But next time I see him,

241
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,340
我会尽力相劝
i'll do what I can.

242
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,780
南茜 坐下
Nancy, sit down.

243
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,760
我知道你在这!
I hear ya!

244
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,710
你抓不住我的 你这狗崽子!
Ya ain't getting me, you son of a bitch!

245
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,410
爸爸?
Pappy?

246
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,530
爸爸?
Pappy?

247
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,700
爸爸?
Pappy?

248
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,260
"亲爱的兰德尔"
"Dear Randall,"

249
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,420
"时运艰难"
"our fortunes are bitter."

250
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,470
"哈特菲尔德传话说"
"Your brother harmon was done murdered,"

251
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,410
"你的弟弟哈蒙被谋杀了"
"it is said by Hatfields.

252
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,820
"我们也只能勉强度日"
"The rest of us barely scrape by."

253
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,690
"亲爱的丈夫 如果你还活着"
"If you are still alive, dear husband,"

254
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,830
"愿你速归"
"i pray that you come home to us soon."

255
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,480
"爱妻 莎莉"
"Your loving wife, sally."

256
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,280
结束了!
It's over!

257
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,120
战争结束了!
The war is over!

258
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,380
李将军属南方邦联

259
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,380
李将军投降了!
General lee surrendered!

260
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,910
- 上帝保佑! - 这场战争终于结束了!
- Praise the lord! - The war is over!

261
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,010
感谢上帝 感谢耶稣
Thank you, thank you, jesus.

262
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,460
真见鬼
Now, I'll be damned.

263
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,530
对某些人来说战争永不休止
Won't be over for some.

264
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,460
战争真他妈是一种浪费
War was a goddamn waste.

265
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,080
我可不想让和平成为战争的祭品
I don't intend to waste the peace.

266
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,080
肯塔基州

267
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,040
谁?
Who's there?

268
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,130
转过来
Now turn around.

269
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,060
兰德尔?
Randall?

270
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,060
莎莉 是我
Sally, it's me.

271
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,560
你憔悴了不少
You've aged some.

272
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,060
北方佬干的
Yankees done it.

273
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,740
在监狱里我们简直是猪狗不如
Treated us worse than animals in that prison.

274
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,500
我并非打算放弃你 我的丈夫 但我别无选择
I didn't want to give up on you, husband, but I think I did.

275
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,310
首先 从我这片林子里砍十英亩树...
First we log my ten acres here...

276
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,760
越过山脊直至丘陵后背
Run from the ridge across and outside that hill.

277
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,090
然后呢?
Then?

278
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,520
我们从中获利
We take the money from that.

279
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,060
就可以再买二十英亩的地
We buy 20 more acres.

280
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,630
买完地呢?
Then what?

281
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,180
再买四十英亩
Buy 40 more.

282
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,600
这就像用马车轮擦你的屁股一样
It's like wiping your ass with a wagon wheel.

283
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,390
没完没了的?
Ain't never gonna end now, is it?

284
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,740
哈特菲尔德先生
Mr. Hatfield.

285
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,910
我是兰德尔・麦考伊的表弟兼律师
I'm a cousin of randall McCoy, an attorney.

286
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,120
我叫佩里・克莱因
My name is Perry Cline.

287
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,310
我在路易维耳市的
I studied law at the offices

288
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,300
伊桑・麦基宾办事处学习法律
of ethan mckibbin in louisville.

289
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,790
去年十月通过了律师考核
Passed the bar last october.

290
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,850
我对即将造成的不快…
I apologize for any unpleasantness

291
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,260
提前致歉
we're about to have.

292
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,070
克莱因先生 有话直说
Just state your business, mr. Cline.

293
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,700
我知道你自认为
Now, I know you believe

294
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,700
自己拥有这片林地
you own this stand of timber

295
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,040
并有权利进行砍伐
and have the right to cut.

296
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,850
然而依据相关法律规定 并非如此
Whereas, in fact, in the eyes of the law, you do not.

297
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,680
你的想法究竟从何而来?
Where in thunder did you get that?

298
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,010
这林地是我老爹1859年
My daddy bought this parcel

299
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,580
从一个越南佬手里买的
off of bucky hand in 1859.

300
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,460
那份契约还躺在家里的一个盒子里呢
I got the deed in a box at home.

301
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,760
我当然相信你 哈特菲尔德先生
I believe you, Mr. Hatfield.

302
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,730
但他把这木材卖给了我的表兄拉瑟福德
But he sold my cousin Rutherford,

303
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,400
现在由我来打理他的财产
whose estate I administer,

304
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,940
早在1858年6月22日就获得木材采伐权
the timber rights beforehand on june 22, 1858.

305
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,810
签字并得以见证 瞧?
Signed and witnessed, see?

306
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,810
那越南佬是我家的一个朋友
Well, bucky was a friend of my family.

307
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,830
如果我们只买了地没买木材 
He'd have told us

308
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,750
他不会不告诉我们的
if we'd not bought the timber with the land.

309
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,910
你这是在逼我起诉 哈特菲尔德先生
You'll force me to sue, mr. Hatfield.

310
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,120
你得承担所有的损失
You'll be liable for damages

311
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,330
还需要支付迄今为止你所砍伐的所有木材
and the cost of all my timber you have cut to date.

312
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
你输定了
You will lose.

313
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,130
那是威胁吗?
That a threat?

314
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,510
我想你还是去起诉更安全
I reckon it's safer you sue.

315
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,470
在没有听到法官异词之前
Without they hear different from a judge,

316
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,810
我的亲戚会以为你在试图敲诈
my relatives might think you just tried to bamboozle me.

317
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,350
那好吧...
Well...

318
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,750
我已表明自己的权利
I've informed you of my rights.

319
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,350
且看法律如何裁决
We'll see what the law has to say about it.

320
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,870
祝你愉快
I bid you good day.

321
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,190
我已准备好尽妻职责
I'm prepared to do my duty as your wife,

322
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,060
但我请求把种子播在我体外
but I ask that you spill your seed outside of me.

323
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,400
我难以承受再育一儿
I could not bear another birth.

324
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,770
? 我主为何流出宝血 ?
Alas and did my savior bleed

325
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,470
? 愿意忍受死亡 ?
and did my sovereign die

326
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,910
? 甘愿代替 ?
would he devote

327
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,510
? 卑微的我 ?
the sacred head

328
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,200
? 遍历痛苦悲怆 ?
for such a worm as I

329
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,350
? 借我主十字架 ?
at the cross, at the cross

330
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,790
? 我得见主恩光 ?
where I first saw the light

331
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,420
? 除罪恶重担 ?
and the burdens of my heart

332
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,630
? 我心洁净 ?
rolled away

333
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,600
? 借十架我信仰 ?
it was there by faith

334
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,300
? 眼明亮心平康 ?
I received my sight

335
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,530
? 到如今 不分昼夜 ?
and now I am happy

336
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,060
? 快乐欢畅 ?
all the day

337
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,580
? 我主为何流出宝血 ?
alas and did my savior bleed

338
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,650
? 为何忍受死亡 ?
and did my sovereign die

339
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,360
? 甘愿代替 ?
would he devote

340
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,700
保重
Well, then, take care.

341
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,230
很高兴再次见到你
Now, good see you again.

342
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,900
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you.

343
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,400
兰德尔 很高兴见到你
Randall, good to see you.

344
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,540
多多保重 谢谢您的到来
Now, take care. Thank you so much.

345
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,790
兰德尔!
Randall!

346
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,640
兰德尔!
Randall!

347
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,820
别闹了
Oh, now, stop fighting.

348
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,250
莎莉
Sally.

349
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,890
莎莉 我们聊聊吧
Sally, you come talk with me.

350
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,920
约翰斯 过来
Come on, Johnse.

351
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,320
来
Come on.

352
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,410
快来
Come on now.

353
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,780
没想到你会在耶和华殿里
Hard to reconcile you in the lord's house.

354
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,870
莉瓦西硬拖我来的...
Yeah, well, Levicy dragged me here to...

355
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,670
真的很高兴见到你 兰德尔
It's good to see you, Randall.

356
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,280
我担心...担心你死在了战场上
I feared...feared you dead.

357
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,680
很多次我都觉得我已经死了
Times I felt like I was.

358
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,090
剩下的兄弟们...或死或失踪 只剩我一个
Rest of the company...all lost, all dead, except me.

359
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,890
莎莉 我们的丈夫都回来了
Our men are home now, sally.

360
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,660
你的是回来了
Yours is.

361
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,800
我丈夫似乎只回来了一半
Mine is only half home.

362
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,530
我说选举那天来看看吧
I mean to enter the election day contest,

363
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,740
当然我尊重你的选择
and I would value your opinion.

364
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,610
拿着
Go ahead.

365
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,310
接骨木果酱?
Elderberry?

366
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,830
没有比这更甜的了
There's nothing sweeter.

367
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,840
不堪设想你都经历了些什么...
It's terrible bad what happened to you...

368
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,850
监狱和所有的一切
Prison and all.

369
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,720
如果有什么可以帮忙的地方
If there's anything I can do to help out.

370
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,320
你是在为你的背叛寻求良心安慰吗?
You propose now to ease your conscience for deserting?

371
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,930
还是为我弟弟的死?
Or for my brother's murder?

372
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,960
是你那个吉姆叔叔干的
Your uncle Jim done it.

373
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,470
如果他在这 我会当面质问
If'n he was here, i'd say it to his face.

374
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,150
吉姆发誓他跟哈蒙的死无关
Jim swears he had nothing to do with harmon's death.

375
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,120
你居然买他的账?
And you believe that?

376
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,580
我不懂与人争执 兰德尔
Well, I have no knowledge to the contrary, randall.

377
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,820
况且吉姆叔叔他...他在上帝面前发了誓的
And uncle jim, he...He swore before god.

378
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,420
哈特菲尔德家族的人要上帝有什么用?
And what use do Hatfields have of god?

379
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,360
就这么说定了 你拿着 尝尝
Well, you keep that, and you try it.

380
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,630
如果这做得...
Let me know if'n it set up and...

381
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,110
谢谢
Thank you.

382
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,210
我不明白...
I don't understa...

383
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,210
太平绅士 瓦伦丁・哈特菲尔德

384
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,020
早安
Mornin'.

385
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,040
我要给你看样东西 克莱因先生
There's something I'd like to show you, Mr. Cline.

386
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,820
差不多要开庭了
Court's about to convene.

387
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,260
是的 我知道 我想你会很期待这东西的
Yeah, well, I think you'll wait for this.

388
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,250
艾利生・利亚斯 
Ellison, 'lias,

389
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,080
给克莱因律师看看我们的证据
show lawyer cline our evidence.

390
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,140
你说哈米什1859年为你那张契约作了见证
You recall that hamish was witness on your bill of sale

391
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,010
但原来发现他
in '59 but somehow died,

392
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,210
早在1857年时就入土了
got himself buried in '57.

393
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:47,070
有印象吗?
You recall that?

394
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,990
我怎么就被假证给耍了
I am somehow made a victim of a fraud.

395
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,790
也不知道我怎么就...
How is not clear to me...

396
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,790
或许你应该跟法官好好解释一下
Maybe you oughta should just fetch the sheriff.

397
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,790
也许他可以帮你缉拿那个
Perchance he can help you track down the scoundrel

398
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,290
把你骗得团团转的骗子
what sold you a bill of goods.

399
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,930
显然这是个变数 哈特菲尔德先生
Obviously this changes things, mr. Hatfield.

400
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,470
是啊
Yeah.

401
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,370
我撤诉
I forgo.

402
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,870
我放弃索取在你土地上的砍伐权
I abandon and renounce claim to the timber rights on your land,

403
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,340
并为我的草率感到抱歉
and I apologize for being hasty

404
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,100
并提出了一起无效的索赔
and putting forth an invalid claim.

405
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,220
你应该得到赔偿 必须的
You deserve to be compensated. You shall be.

406
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,560
我身上有二十二美元
I have $22 here.

407
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,150
把你的钱收起来
Keep your money.

408
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,420
我别无它意 哈特菲尔德先生
I take that kindly, mr. Hatfield.

409
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,020
事业刚起步的年轻律师
Young lawyer starting his career,

410
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,000
轻易就被一份伪造证件给耍了 形势不妙啊
deceived by a forged document don't look well.

411
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,270
太不妙了
Don't look well at all.

412
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,370
人们甚至不禁会开始猜想
People might even start to think

413
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,580
你从中也掺了一脚 并搞得一团糟
that you had a hand in this forgin' and then bungled it.

414
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,550
你想干嘛 哈特菲尔德先生
What do you want, mr. Hatfield?

415
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,250
你想要得到所有属于我的东西
Well, you meant to have all that was mine.

416
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,090
所以我也要得到你的一切
So I must be entitled to have all what's yours.

417
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,390
至少是你从你父亲那继承的部分
At least what you inherited from your daddy.

418
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,130
那可是五千亩地啊
That's 5,000 acres.

419
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,200
我不贪图你的林地
Don't hardly much want the land.

420
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,390
我只要伐木权
Just the timber rights.

421
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,350
我想我们没必要闹到法庭上 是吧?
I don't believe we have to go in court at all, do we?

422
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,520
找不到 老爹
Can't find her, pa.

423
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,450
该死的
Consarn it.

424
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,490
继续找
Keep looking.

425
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,450
只是一只小猪而已
It's one little pig.

426
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,890
而且很可能被山狮吃了
Mountain lion probably got her.

427
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,860
那只猪如果养肥了可以够我们吃一个冬天
That pig fattened up feeds this family for a whole winter.

428
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,140
明白吗 孩子?
You understand that, boy?

429
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,100
灾难折磨着我们
Misfortune afflicts us both.

430
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,770
抱歉让你失去了林地 表弟 
Sorry about you losing your land, cousin.

431
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,580
但是 他们的背信弃义改变不了
Still, we cannot let our paths be diverted

432
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,360
我们的原则
by the treachery of others.

433
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,900
相信上帝 多做善事
Trust in the lord and do good,

434
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,530
你就会得偿所愿
and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

435
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,070
完成了 爸爸 你喜欢吗?
All done, poppy. You like it?

436
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,190
剪得很好 罗斯安娜
Fine job, roseanna.

437
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,090
给
Here.

438
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,330
我一直想把这个给你
I've been meaning to give you this.

439
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,470
金纽扣?
A gold button?

440
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,830
这是战争中得到的
It's from the war.

441
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,170
给我吗?
For me?

442
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,270
因为你是我的最爱
'Cause you're my favorite.

443
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,540
或许你是对的 兰德尔
Perhaps you're right, randall.

444
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,410
但我不会放松警惕
But I would not drop my guard.

445
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,250
战争改造了人
War changes men.

446
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,580
到了和平时期 他们就变成
Peacetime can turn them into

447
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,380
诡计多端的蛇
scheming snakes.

448
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,690
我猜哈特菲尔德会不停地来找你
I predict Hatfield will keep coming at you

449
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,620
假装友好而慷慨
feigning friendship and generosity.

450
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,930
当他这么做时
And when he does,

451
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,710
你就会知道我是对的
you'll know I'm right.

452
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,880
我就觉得会在这找到你 兰德尔
I hoped I might find you here, randall.

453
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,630
就像从前一样 对吧?
Almost like old times, huh?

454
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,160
什么风把你吹到城镇来了?
What brings you to town?

455
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,530
生意
Business.

456
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,300
我刚刚和金克斯・克莱布瑞特达成协议
I just made a deal with jinx clabberat

457
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,530
将他的一些部分好的低洼地转让给我的人
to farm out some of his good bottomland with my boys.

458
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,200
我们可以种一些经济作物
We might just grow us a big cash crop of tobaccy.

459
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,450
很好
Good.

460
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,470
很好
Good.

461
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,010
你是来这炫耀
You come to boast about stealing

462
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,480
从我表弟佩里・克莱因那里夺来的成果吗?
from my cousin Perry Cline?

463
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,450
没有人来这炫耀 兰德尔
Nobody come here to boast, randall.

464
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,470
我只是想向你示好
I'm just-i'm just trying to be friendly.

465
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,190
我不知道你听说了什么
I don't know what you heard,

466
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,500
但我没有一样东西是从你表弟那夺来的
but nary a thing was stole from your kin.

467
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,560
当我揭穿佩里・克莱因的谎言时
Perry Cline gave me his timber rights

468
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,100
他就把伐木权给了我
when I uncovered how he was trying to cheat me.

469
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,200
我当时就该打爆他该死的脑袋
I should've blown his damn head off is what I shoulda done,

470
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,490
但是...
but...

471
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,370
你认为我这是阴谋诡计 你..
You think I profited unfairly, you...

472
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,080
你拿着这个
you take this.

473
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,260
你凭良心收下
You take that in good conscience.

474
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,490
这是不是让你饱受折磨呀?
Does it weigh on you at all, captain Hatfield,

475
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,290
你轻松获利 而其他人坚持到底
how you profited while others stayed the course

476
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,310
却受苦受难?
and suffered for it?

477
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,040
没有人能质疑我付出 了多少
No man questions what I gave the cause, randall.

478
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,650
尤其是你
Especially you.

479
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,110
再来一杯
'nother one.

480
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,110
1878年
西弗吉尼亚州 拖轮河谷

481
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,840
传言说 这里要建一条铁路
Talk is, they're gonna build a railroad right through here.

482
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,640
那样我们的木材就可以运往各个地方
Then we'll send our timber in all directions

483
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,310
遍及全国
'round the whole country.

484
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,680
我希望不要运往北方
Not up north, I hope.

485
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,020
战争早就结束了
War's long over, jim.

486
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,720
没有南北之分
There's no north, no south-

487
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,850
只有赚钱的人和不赚钱的人
Just people who got money and people who ain't.

488
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,820
我打算和他们做生意
I mean to do business with them that has.

489
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,460
我一直都坚信我们会发财
I always knew we was gonna be rich.

490
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,660
嘿!
Hey!

491
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,100
威廉 你的孩子!
It's your boy, william!

492
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,670
树倒了!
Tree fell!

493
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,770
木渣掉进了他的眼睛!
Splinter caught his eye!

494
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,390
我看不到!
I can't see!

495
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,740
埃迪 我什么也看不到!
Eddie, I can't see!

496
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,280
为什么我看不见?
Why can't I see?

497
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,280
我知道很难受 孩子
I know it hurts bad, son.

498
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,890
我很佩服你 佩服你能忍受这么大的痛苦
I admire how you-I admire how you standin' up to it.

499
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,090
给我一些水
Give me some water.

500
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,660
约翰斯 为什么我看不到?
Johnse, why can't I see?

501
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,430
我们马上送你看医生
We're gonna get you to a doctor straightaway.

502
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,800
昂斯
Anse.

503
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,320
你不会死的
You're not gonna die,

504
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,830
但我不想撒谎
but I won't lie to you.

505
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,750
你伤得很重
This is a serious wound.

506
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,430
你好 邻居
Howdy, neighbors.

507
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,260
兰德尔
Randall.

508
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,150
莎莉夫人
Miss sally.

509
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,320
你还好吗 浮洛伊德?
How do you do, floyd?

510
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,170
大好的日子 是吧?
Blessed day, ain't it?

511
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,540
当然啦
Sure is.

512
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,680
你这季收成如何?
How's your harvest this season?

513
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,880
一般般
Fair to middlin'.

514
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,180
比上不足
Better than the last one.

515
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,630
比下有余
Not as good as the next.

516
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,180
你的猪养得好肥
Your hogs fattened up nice.

517
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,990
哦 坏脾气的小家伙
Ah, ornery critters.

518
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,750
孩子们和狗试图圈住它们时
Had the kids and dogs try to round them up,

519
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,390
它们就不停地哼哼
but these two kept a'squealin' off.

520
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,660
告诉我 你养这个斑点猪
Tell me, floyd, how long have you had

521
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,830
多长时间了?
that spotted shoat there?

522
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,430
呃 去年的
Well, he bred last year.

523
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,500
我知道它什么时候养的
I know when it was bred.

524
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,350
我在它耳朵上做了记号
That's my markin' on its ears.

525
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,710
哦 不 兰德尔 你弄错了
Ah, no, randall, you're mistook.

526
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,110
我特意在我的猪上做了记号 
I notch my swines particular

527
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,880
这样我就不会弄错
so I do not get mistook.

528
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,580
呃 你知道的 小猪很喜欢到处跑
Well, you know young pigs is wanderers.

529
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,520
我想我的一两头猪或许正挂在你的厨房里
I expect you gots one or two of mine hangin' in your smokehouse.

530
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,820
我不会
I do not.

531
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,920
你到底还偷了多少我的猪?
How many more of my pigs you took?

532
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,000
你偷了多少我的猪肉来填饱你的肚皮?
How much pork you takin' from my family to stuff your belly?

533
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,860
等会儿 兰德尔 这是个大罪名
Now, hang on, randall. That's a serious accusal.

534
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,230
你是想吵架吧
You's bein' quarrelsome.

535
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,760
我就是了 怎么样?
I am, am i?

536
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,430
试试这个怎么样?
Well, how's this for quarrelsome?

537
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
该死的偷猪贼 浮洛伊德・ 哈特菲尔德
Damn you for a pig thief, floyd Hatfield.

538
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,440
驾
Come on.

539
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,550
快走 饭桶
Come on, git.

540
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,630
你们全家人都跟你一个德行!
I guess all you Hatfields are the same!

541
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,200
你吃饱了吗 佩里?
Did you get enough to eat, Perry?

542
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,680
谢谢
Thank you.

543
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,010
多么优雅的莎莉阿姨
An elegant sufficiency, aunt sally.

544
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,620
太优雅了
Elegant sufficiency.

545
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,620
罗斯安娜 帮我清理桌子
Roseanna, help me clear the table.

546
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,840
爱丽菲尔 你去清理小的那桌
Alifair, the little one.

547
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,060
浮洛伊德・ 哈特菲尔德
This matter of floyd Hatfield

548
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,760
偷走了你的牲畜...
and the theft of your livestock...

549
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,680
他撒谎还当着我的面抵赖
He lied and denied it to my face.

550
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,630
起诉他
We sue.

551
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,670
我们要把法律看成我们的肌肉
It's useful to think of the law as a muscle.

552
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,540
像肌肉一样 法律是越用越强
Like a muscle, it can be strengthened with proper use.

553
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,210
使用太少 它就会变弱
Used too little, it becomes feeble

554
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,610
弱到无法保护你
and too weak to protect you.

555
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,270
你说得很好 佩里
That's fine talk, Perry.

556
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,050
你很有天赋
You got the gift.

557
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,490
浮洛伊德・ 哈特菲尔德在河的另一边
Floyd Hatfield is on the other side of the river.

558
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,620
那里由哈特菲尔德的人当法官
Where a Hatfield sits as judge.

559
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,190
我可以安排陪审团审案
Mm, I can arrange a jury trial.

560
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,140
我们安排六个麦考伊的人
We'll sit six McCoys

561
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,590
和六个哈特菲尔德的人
and six Hatfields.

562
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,870
虽然不能为你可怜的被杀的兄弟讨回公道
It won't get you justice for your poor murdered brother.

563
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,750
但赢得这场官司也是一种公道
We win this case, it's a kind of justice nonetheless.

564
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,870
我觉得这样愚蠢至极
It strikes me as foolish.

565
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,940
此话怎讲 女士?
How's that, ma'am?

566
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,910
为了一头猪上法庭
Goin' to court over a pig.

567
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,310
弄得我们像愚蠢的乡下人
Makes us look like some village idiot.

568
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,850
莎莉...
Sally...

569
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,020
我想 最终
I suppose, in the end,

570
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,490
上帝会惩罚所有的罪人
god punishes all transgression.

571
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,400
但是 你应该知道
But, as you well know,

572
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,290
通常 上帝想要我们
oftentimes the good lord expects us

573
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,100
帮他实现愿望
to be the instrument of his will.

574
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,770
你怎么看 吉姆?
What say you, jim?

575
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,880
起诉他
I say we sue.

576
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,950
眼睛怎么样了?
How's the eye doing?

577
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,160
一片浑浊 看不见了
It's gone milky, capped over.

578
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,230
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

579
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,200
- 让我瞧瞧 - 不 吉姆
- Let me see. - No, jim.

580
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,900
- 别这样 让我瞧瞧 - 吉姆
- Come on, let me see. - Jim.

581
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,830
看看嘛
Let me see it.

582
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,280
转过去
Turn around.

583
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,140
我在这干嘛?
What am I doin' here?

584
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,680
支持你的家族
You're supporting your family.

585
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,680
就为了一只猪?
Over a pig?

586
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,980
昂斯
Anse.

587
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,460
拿走
Put it away.

588
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,320
我要叫你队长(captain)
I'm gonna call you captain.

589
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,880
简称盖子(cap)
Cap for captain.

590
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,660
就像你爹一样
Like your daddy.

591
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,680
表明你是一个伟大的伐木者
Shows you're an important feller.

592
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,000
盖子是个好名字 不是吗?
Good name, cap, hmm?

593
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,480
是 我喜欢极了
Yeah, I like it.

594
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,780
嗨 沃尔叔叔!
Hi, uncle wall!

595
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,330
嗨 沃尔叔叔!
Hi, uncle wall!

596
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,850
现在开庭
Court is in session.

597
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,760
感谢在场的陪审员
Thanks to those of you on the jury

598
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,960
参加此次审案
for coming here today and agreeing to serve.

599
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,960
我知道你们大多数都有作物和牲畜需要照料
I know most of y'all got crops. Stock needs tendin'.

600
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,330
所以我不会耽误你们
So I ain't gonna keep you from your task

601
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,970
太多时间
any longer than necessary.

602
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,370
尊敬的哈特菲尔德法官 陪审团成员
Judge Hatfield, members of the jury,

603
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,360
我们要将法律当作肌肉
it is useful to think of the law as a muscle.

604
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,050
正如肌肉一样 法律是越用越强
Like a muscle, it can be strengthened with proper use.

605
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,810
克莱因先生
Mr. Cline.

606
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,440
你的话越少
The briefer you make your remarks,

607
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,900
你胜诉的可能性就越大
the better your case is gonna be received.

608
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,150
活该 饶舌之人
Serves you, windbag.

609
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,240
请坐!
Sit down!

610
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,920
你要宣证人吗?
Do you mean to call witnesses?

611
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,090
兰德尔・麦考伊先生和他的妻子莎莉
Mr. Randall McCoy and his wife, sally,

612
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,730
都看到了那头猪的耳朵上
both saw the McCoy markin'

613
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,750
有麦考伊所作的标记
on the ear of the hog in question.

614
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,930
哦 看来没必要请他们站出来
Oh, now, I don't think we need to call 'em to the stand

615
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,170
你说就好了
just to say so.

616
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,900
所以简而言之
So to put it plain,

617
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,400
麦考伊一家说那是他们的猪 
the McCoys say it is their pig

618
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,470
有他们所作的记号
and their notch,

619
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,880
而浮洛伊德否认
and Floyd says that ain't so.

620
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,140
对么?
Is that clear?

621
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,510
是的
Sure.

622
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,610
今天那只猪上庭了么?
Is the pig in court today?

623
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,770
没
No, it ain't.

624
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,350
为什么?
Why not?

625
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,350
那个...
Well, um...

626
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,200
它已经被吃掉了
It's done been et.

627
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,150
那好 浮洛伊德
All right, Floyd.

628
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,290
在你宰了它之前 有谁能证明猪耳朵上的记号
You got any witness saw it before you butchered the swine

629
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,740
是你刻上去的?
to say it is your notch?

630
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,930
我不知道要找人证
I didn't know I needed one.

631
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,370
不过如果你给我几个小时
If you give me a couple hours,

632
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,130
我也许能找到
I might could come up with somebody.

633
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,290
我见过
I seen it.

634
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,110
那只肥猪
The hog in question, that is.

635
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,960
我看到浮洛伊德割下了它的耳朵
And I seen floyd actually cut that shoat's ear.

636
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,940
噢 需要我向圣经之名宣誓吗?
Oh, do I need to say I seen it on the bible?

637
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,310
我劝你别那样
I'd advise you not to.

638
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,550
我记得那只猪的后腿上有黑点
That pig had black spots on its hams, as I recollect.

639
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,420
还有浮洛伊德作记号时 手滑了下
And Floyd's hand slipped when he notched it.

640
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,760
差点切下他的大拇指
Pretty near cut his thumb off.

641
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,510
不管怎样 如果那只猪是浮洛伊德偷来的话 
Anyways, why would Floyd show him that swine

642
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,260
怎么还会让我们看到?
if he stole it?

643
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,760
那不是没道理么
It don't make no sense.

644
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,760
好了 比尔
That's enough, Bill.

645
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,700
我认为比尔・斯塔顿的证词
I trust y'all give Bill Staton's testimony

646
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,370
所言非虚
the respect it deserves.

647
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,270
阁下 我还没说完 你看...
Your honor, I ain't quite done, you see...

648
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,910
你坐下!
You sit down!

649
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,880
陪审团的成员们
Me Mbers of the jury,

650
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,950
有谁认为猪是浮洛伊德・ 哈特菲尔德的?
who thinks the hog belonged to Floyd Hatfield?

651
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,510
好的 有谁认为猪是兰德尔・麦考伊的?
All right, who believes the hog was Randall McCoy's?

652
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,390
- 这里 - 是的 先生
- Here. - Yes, sir.

653
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,510
塞尔柯克・麦考伊 
Selkirk McCoy,

654
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,220
你没投这边是要投给那边是么
you didn't vote one way or t'other.

655
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,600
他投给兰德尔叔叔了
Well, he votes uncle Randall.

656
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,170
让他自己说 帕里斯
He has to be the one to say so, Parris.

657
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,210
我想做公正点
Well, I'm trying to do the right thing here.

658
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,430
你们看 我虽然是麦考伊家族的人 但...
You see, I am of the McCoy family, but...

659
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,420
事实上 在心底
Well, the truth is, deep down

660
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,370
我真觉得猪是浮洛伊德・ 哈特菲尔德的
I do believe that pig was one of Floyd Hatfield's razorbacks.

661
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,210
判决立刻出来了
Judgment's goin' down in a second.

662
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,960
请尊重麦考伊这个姓氏
Do not disrespect the name McCoy.

663
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,490
比尔・斯塔顿发誓
Bill Staton swears on his oath

664
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,000
他亲眼看到浮洛伊德割出了那个切口
that he seen Floyd cut that notch.

665
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,560
你这个满口谎话的卑鄙小人
You are a lying spawn of hell

666
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,550
你投他是因为你和哈特菲尔德的太太有一腿!
that voted his Hatfield wife's apron strings!

667
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,840
哦 兰德尔 这...
Oh, Randall, this...

668
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,840
别把她扯进来
Leave her on out of this.

669
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,400
别因为一头猪
Gonna give yourself apoplexy.

670
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,010
就气得中风了
All this to-do over a pig.

671
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,880
这关乎声誉
This is about honor,

672
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,360
关乎谎言 偷窃 以及谋杀
about lyin' and stealin' and murderin'.

673
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,320
这与本案无关
That is not pertinent to the case.

674
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,450
这关乎罪孽 恶魔昂斯!
It's about sin, Devil Anse!

675
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,950
基督徒的权力和诅咒!
What's christian right and damnation wrong!

676
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,220
麦考伊!
McCoy!

677
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,660
这一案件被驳回了!
This case is dismissed!

678
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,480
所有人都出去!
Everybody get the hell out of here!

679
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,470
老天作证 谁再鼓动作乱
By god, I will gut-shoot the next agitator

680
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,010
藐视法庭 我就要开枪了
who further disrespects my courtroom,

681
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,340
不管是麦考伊还是哈特菲尔德家的人
McCoy or Hatfield.

682
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,010
在哈特菲尔德家的法庭
I reckon this is what I shoulda expected

683
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,610
我早猜到会这样了
from a Hatfield court.

684
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,180
麦考伊 你再多说一个字
One more word out of you, McCoy,

685
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,690
只会让我看不起你
i'll hold you in contempt.

686
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,820
最好注意下你高傲的态度
Best watch your high-and-mighty ass,

687
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,960
麦考伊牧师
preacher McCoy.

688
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,090
送你一句经文:
Here's scripture for you:

689
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,350
"杀人流血 接连不断"
"blood toucheth blood."

690
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,710
你不想走这步的 科顿
You don't want to make that move, Cotton.

691
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,470
看吧 你爸爸不会告诉你这些
See, your daddy won't tell you that

692
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,240
是因为他想打倒你
'cause he's trying to beat you.

693
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,480
谢了 沃尔叔叔
Thanks, uncle Wall.

694
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,350
是啊 谢谢你 沃尔叔叔
Yeah, thanks, uncle Wall.

695
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,350
不管怎样 我想说
Anyway, what I'm saying is,

696
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,950
你站在那里最终也毫无帮助 昂斯
you standin' up there in the end didn't help things, Anse.

697
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,100
是啊 事情还在掌控中
Yeah, well, I had it under control.

698
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,060
看你干的好事
The hell you did.

699
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:47,530
这些小争吵却成了一个致命的导火线
These picayune squabbles got a way of turning deadly.

700
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,800
也许吧 但我不能再让兰德尔・麦考伊
Maybe so, but I cannot have Randall McCoy

701
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,780
继续为难我们了
continue to embarrass us.

702
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,770
一点小小的尴尬
A little embarrassment's

703
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,300
好过不公正的裁决
better'n what grows out of injustice,

704
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,990
你觉得呢?
don't you think?

705
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,580
当我发誓看到那头猪后腿上有黑点时
You see the look on ol' Randall McCoy's face

706
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,700
你们有没有注意兰德尔・麦考伊脸上的表情?
when I swore that pig had black spots on his hams?

707
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,050
你喝多了 那么大声
More you drink, louder you get.

708
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,940
这些麦考伊如果找我麻烦的话
Them McCoys come after me,

709
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,010
我会像砍佩里・克莱因的树一样砍他们
i'll cut 'em down like Perry Cline's trees.

710
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,480
我会阉了他们
Hell, I'll even nut 'em.

711
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,080
你想再说一次么?
You wanna say that again?

712
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,370
我很愿意拿你这根小牙签
I'd just love to take away that arkansas toothpick of your,

713
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,530
插进你屁眼里
shove it straight up your stinkin' asshole.

714
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,360
我是说如果麦考伊因为
I said any McCoys come after me

715
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,470
我在法庭上说的那些来找我麻烦的话
for what I said in court,

716
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,520
我会撂倒他 我会阉了他
i'll take 'em down, and I'll nut 'em.

717
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,920
我猜你可能是有那么蠢
Well, I suspect you might be stupid enough to try.

718
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,040
你...你叫我出去 是么?
You...you callin' me out, hmm?

719
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,880
别在这里
This ain't the place.

720
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,970
狗嘴里吐不出象牙 比尔・斯塔顿
But you got a mighty big mouth, Bill Staton.

721
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,040
好了 别做傻事 坐下吧...
Okay, nothin' to do but just sit here...

722
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,130
任何麦考伊家的人来找我麻烦
Any McCoy come after me and do me harm,

723
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,480
我都会撂倒你们的!
i'll take you down!

724
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,300
过来啊!
Come on!

725
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,930

Eh! What, are you scared?

726
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,560
很有趣吧 臭虫 嗯?
That was fun, Skunky, huh?

727

你觉得好玩么? 你觉得开心么?
You had fun with that? You happy with that?

728
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,900
你知道么 你胆真肥
You know, you're brave.

729
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,150
我再也不跟你一起喝酒了
I ain't gonna drink with you. I ain't gonna drink with you.

730
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,480
你好啊 昂斯
Howdy, Anse.

731
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,720
我想我告诉他们了
I guess I told 'em, huh.

732
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,120
如果看到一只恶狗在睡觉 你会去吵醒它么?
You see a mean dog sleeping, do you go pester him?

733
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,990
- 不会 先生 - 不会

它醒了 你会去打它么?
He awake, you go kick him?

735
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,360
你也不会
No, you don't.

736
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,160
你会让它呆着 它可能会继续回去睡觉
You leave him alone, maybe he goes back to sleep.

737
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,630
你懂我的意思了么?
You get my point?

738
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,140
懂了 但是那些可恶的麦考伊家的人...
Yeah, but those shit-butt McCoys...

739
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,670
我们互相理解了么?
We understand each other?

740
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,760
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

741
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,710

? 我说过我不抽烟 ?
I said that I don't smoke

745
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,520
? 我玩了你的女人 我玩了你的女人 ?
I give your girl a poke, I give your girl a poke

746
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:29,470
下午好 比尔
afternoon, Bill.

747
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,680
你想阉了我们?
You want to nut us?

748
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,680
我抓住你们啦 哈?
I got ya both, huh?

Here we are, bill.

You still want to take us down,

751
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,650

我们要不要阉了他?
Should we nut him?

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,060
快走 快走
Come on, come on.

755
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,620
该死
Shit.

756
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:57,800
快跑
Come on.

757
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,690
恶魔昂斯在外面
It's devil anse.

758
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,020
一个人?
Alone?

759
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,350
是啊 他一个人还不够么?
Well, ain't he enough?

760
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,000
混蛋们!
Sons a bitches!

761
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,710
别杀我们
Don't you slay us.

762
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:47,900
盖子...
Cap...

763
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,400
我在 爸爸
Yeah, pa.

764
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,140
捡起他们的枪
Pick up them guns.

765
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,520
把这些败家子带回去
Let's get these wastrels back across the river.

766
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,960
这是一个适合绞刑的好日子
It's a nice day for a hangin',

767
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,390
是吧 兰德尔?
ain't it, ol' Randall?

768
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,400
恶人吉姆・万斯
Mean Jim Vance.

769
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,800
近距离看起来
Well, you're not all that much.

770
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,040
你也不怎么样嘛
I mean, up close-like.

771
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,340
你算那根葱?
Who the hell are you?

772
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,390
噢 我叫托尔伯特・麦考伊 是兰德尔的儿子
Oh, I'm Tolbert McCoy, son of Randall.

773
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,440
我一直很想见见那个杀了我叔叔的人
See, I always wanted to meet the man that murdered my uncle

774
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,310
并且亲口告诉他他的好日子也快完了
and tell him his days are comin'.

775
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,320
你没资格跟我说这样的话
Not from the likes of you,

776
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,950
你个乳臭未干的黄毛小子
you wet-eared prick-chafing little shit.

777
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,390
在我像扇一只小鸡一样扇你之前滚出我的视线
Get out of my sight before I snap you like a chicken neck!

778
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,370
托尔伯特
Tolbert.

779
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,310
我们有正事要干
We're here on other business.

780
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,760
滚开!
Move!

781
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,850
我的两个侄子
What are my two nephews doing in there

782
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,780
为什么被锁在这个冰冷的尸体旁边?
being locked up next to this godforsaken corpse?

783
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,420
这是自食其果
You live with what you done,

784
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,090
如果可能的话
you might think twice before doin' it again

785
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,950
你们就该三思而行
if you should so get the chance.

786
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,020
法官 我恭敬的请求保释金
Judge, I respectfully request that bail be set

787
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,190
应该调至一个合理的数目
at a reasonable amount.

788
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,390
否决
Denied.

789
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,530
这两个男孩被指控犯了死罪
These boys stand accused of a capital crime.

790
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,830
我不会让这个案子拖很久的
And I will not have this business dragged out to fester.

791
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,470
给我个理由
You want to tell me why

792
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,330
我不该以谋杀罪吊死他们么?
I shouldn't hang 'em both for murder?

793
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,980
作为一个哈特菲尔德家的人 
Bein' a Hatfield,

794
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,750
你很难做到完全公正
you're hardly impartial.

795
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,940
我是今天的正式出庭律师
I'm the attorney of record here,

796
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,470
我来回答这些问题
and I'll answer the questions.

797
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,540
比尔・斯塔顿被谋杀了
Bill Staton threatened to kill

798
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,380
有麦考伊家的人路过
any McCoys that crossed his path.

799
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,050
现在我们有目击证人看到
Now, we got witnesses to that.

800
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,780
帕里斯和山姆路过遇到了他
Parris and Sam did cross his path,

801
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,550
然后斯塔顿想杀了他们
and Staton did try to kill them,

802
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,890
最后反而被帕里斯和山姆自卫所误杀
then was killed himself by parris and sam in self-defense,

803
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,160
这两个守法的年轻人感到很内疚
which these law-abiding young men deeply regret.

804
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,940
阿门 我们确实很内疚
Amen. We surely do.

805
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,150
因为自卫而失手误杀
We's real sorry we had to do it,

806
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
我们感到非常抱歉
defending ourselves like that,

807
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,800
但是比尔・斯塔顿逼得我们走投无路
but Bill Staton give us no choice.

808
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,340
不管怎么样 法官
In any event, judge,

809
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:07,940
你没有权力审判死刑罪
you got no authority to try a capital case.

810
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,410
明白
Noted.

811
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,820
昂斯 在我宣布之前你有没有什么想说的?
Anse, you got anything to say 'fore I pronounce sentence?

812
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,480
比尔・斯塔顿 是个不错的工人
Bill Staton was a tolerable worker,

813
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,600
总是把赚到的钱给他母亲 
always gave money to

814
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,010
还一直帮他搬运柴火
and got wood in for his mother

815
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,430
直到去年冬天她去世
till she died last winter.

816
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,630
他的确喝多了
He did drink a bit.

817
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,030
帕里斯和山姆都知道比尔只是威胁...
Parris and Sam both knew that Bill's threats-they both knew...

818
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,350
他们就像空酒瓶一样无知
That they was empty as the bottles they was comin' from.

819
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,020
很明显他们想报复他因为他乱说话
They wanted to revenge his mouthin' off, plain and simple.

820
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:43,140
然后等在那里
Then they lay in wait to get it.

821
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,040
这是有预谋的凶杀
That's premeditated homicide,

822
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:49,080
根据法律和万能的上帝
for which accordin' to the law and your almighty god,

823
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,350
他们应该被绞死
they had oughta hang.

824
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,680
你说话直冒傻气
You're talkin' like a fool.

825
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,890
死在这的这杂种醉鬼
This lowlife drunkard lyin' dead here

826
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,250
威胁说要灭了我全家
threatened murder on my family!

827
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,590
够了!
God damn it!

828
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,380
都给我过来坐下 然后闭上嘴
Y'all just get over here and sit down and shut up.

829
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,720
我们都知道是帕里斯和山姆杀了比尔・斯塔顿
All of us know parris and sam killed bill staton.

830
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:15,920
只是案情详情还不明确
Only the circumstances remain in question.

831
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,580
实在太令人羞耻了
It's a damn shame

832
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,120
居然没人告诉他们在大街上朝醉鬼开枪
no one told 'em shootin' a drunk on the road

833
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,860
是错的 为此受绞刑更是不值
was wrong and not worth hangin' for

834
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,040
连做个榜样都不够格
or even the price of the goddamn lead.

835
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,690
而更令人羞耻的是
And it's also a damn shame

836
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,560
居然没人阻止他的雇工
that no one stopped his hired hand's

837
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,400
酒后口出狂言
liquored-up threats and curses

838
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,100
导致两个红了眼的傻蛋犯下杀人罪
from inflaming two fools to commit murder,

839
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,340
一切本可避免发生
which was damn easy to foresee.

840
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:01,390
我裁定你们俩有罪
I find you both guilty of this heinous crime,

841
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,020
你们将即刻被
for which you are to be taken

842
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,090
送往指定地点
to some convenient spot without delay

843
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:10,340
处以绞刑 直至断气
and thereby hanged by the neck until you are dead.

844
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,040
由于你们之中无人能证明
A sentence which I hereby suspend

845
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,590
是在正当防卫或不是 以上裁决宣告无效
since no one can say whether it was self-defense or not.

846
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,600
走吧 孩子们 快滚出去
Go on, boys. Get the hell out of here.

847
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,600
谢谢您 先生
Thank you, sir.

848
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,570
在这呢!
Right there!

849
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,470
卡尔文 无罪释放!
Calvin, not guilty!

850
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,950
我就知道你老爹肯定能把咱们弄出去
I knew your daddy would get us out of there.

851
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,540
苍天明鉴
As god as my witness,

852
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,540
我决不允许这场审判
I will not allow my court

853
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,370
成为两家开战的导火索
to be the cause of a war between our two families.

854
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,380
看在他去世的母亲的份上 比尔・斯塔顿
Bill staton ain't worth it and his ma, who he did do right by,

855
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,460
不该遭此一劫 
is dead and gone.

856
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,340
愿她的灵魂安息
God rest her soul.

857
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,960
就这么记:
Write it in the book:

858
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,800
沃尔・哈特菲尔德法官
"miscreants discharged

859
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:15,990
放走了歹徒
by judge wall Hatfield."

860
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,760
谢谢 法官阁下
Thank you, judge.

861
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,230
你今天绝对做到了公正贤明
You've been a fair and wise man today.

862
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,560
绝对的
Indeed.

863
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,170
上帝是公平的 出来混
God is just and shall return to us

864
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,740
迟早是要还的
the years that the locusts hath eaten.

865
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,180
好吧 你还真是自我感觉良好啊
Well, you're just a huckleberry above a persimmon,

866
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,250
不是吗?
ain't ya?

867
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,850
若你两人还不能好好反省自己的所作所为
If you two don't mend what's wrong between you,

868
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,120
地狱之火必会燃起 
hellfire's gonna certainly rise up and consume

869
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,470
直至烧毁两个家族
both our families.

870
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,760
谢谢 克莱因先生 阁下
Thank you, Mr. Cline, sir.

871
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,430
- 这就对了 - 干的太漂亮了
- That's right. - That's mighty fine work.

872
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,230
老爹 我们接住他了!
We got him, pa!

873
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,260
今天运气不错
It is a good day for it.

874
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,000
- 快点上马车 孩子们 - 好耶!
- Get up in the wagon here, boys. - Whoo!

875
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,480
你他妈有什么好开心的?
What the hell you laughing at?

876
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,240
看看这是谁? 信了吧!
Look who it is, huh? Believe it!

877
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,400
最好是信了!
You better believe it!

878
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:22,400
1880年 选举日

879
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,500
悠着点 孩子
Whoa, easy now, son.

880
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,140
你现在还不想让它爆吧
Don't want it going off just yet.

881
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,170
对呀 笨蛋
Yeah, mush-head.

882
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,540
别把我们都给炸飞了
Don't blow us all up,

883
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,930
你这弱智杂种
you half-wit bastard moron.

884
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,350
过来 给我过来!
Come here. Come here!

885
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,550
觉得有意思? 过来啊
Find it funny? Come here.

886
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,050
道歉
Apologize.

887
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,160
嗯 对不起你这杂种了 科顿
Yeah, I'm sorry you's a bastard, cotton.

888
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,290
好好说!
Tell him!

889
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,630
好吧 好吧
All right. All right.

890
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,260
对不起
I'm sorry.

891
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,260
你这道歉一点没诚意
That ain't good enough.

892
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,000
我很抱歉那么称呼你
I apologize for what I called you

893
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,610
我以后绝不会再那么叫你了
and won't never call you no names again.

894
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,010
老爹 你不用那么做的
Didn't have to do that, pa.

895
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,440
每个人都叫我笨蛋
Everybody calls me mush-head.

896
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,180
科顿 你是与众不同的
Well, you ain't like everybody else, cotton.

897
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,250
上帝给了你一副宽广的胸怀
God gave you such a big heart,

898
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,520
所以不能再给你充满智慧的脑袋
he couldn't very well give you a whole abundance of brains,

899
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,990
你说是不?
now, too, could he?

900
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,330
我想是的
I guess not.

901
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,500
可我确实是杂种啊
I am a bastard, though.

902
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,500
听我说 孩子
You listen to me, boy. Hmm?

903
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,340
杂种是不会有人来爱的
A bastard's got no family that loves him.

904
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,660
你是这样的吗?
Is that you?

905
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,240
你没人爱吗?
Is that you?

906
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,310
不 不是的
No, it's not.

907
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,410
你是我儿子
You're my son.

908
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,500
不然为啥给你起名艾利生?
Why do you think your first name's ellison?

909
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,960
现在 让它飞起来吧
Now, let's see it fly.

910
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,120
让大家都退后
Get everybody back now.

911
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,260
好嘞
Okeydokey!

912
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,340
大家都往后站站
Everybody stand back now!

913
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,600
我说不行
Nuh-uh. I said no.

914
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,100
我就趴这了 管你们怎么弄
I gotta make a livin' here, god dang it.

915
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,640
想喝免费的威士忌
You want free whiskey,

916
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,940
你得和那边的托尔伯特・麦考伊去说
you go talk to tolbert McCoy over there.

917
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,480
我会去的
I might do that.

918
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,380
现在别看
Don't look now.

919
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,350
约翰斯・哈特菲尔德 正盯着我们呢
Johnse Hatfield is staring at us.

920
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,420
我真希望有只乌鸦冲下来把他眼睛啄走
I sure hope crows swoop down and pluck his eyes out.

921
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,360
说什么呢 南茜
What a thing to say, nancy.

922
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,390
他的舅舅吉姆・万斯杀了我爸
His uncle Jim Vance killed my pap.

923
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,560
你又不能肯定
You don't know that for sure.

924
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,060
每个人都这么说
Everybody says so.

925
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:37,660
别听他们瞎说
Don't make it for sure.

926
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,330
他很帅倒是真的
He sure is handsome.

927
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,370
恶魔昂斯的儿子
Son o' devil anse.

928
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,690
从没见过长的这么勾魂的魔鬼
I ain't never seen no devil look like that.

929
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,210
- 嘿 盖子 - 有事吗?
- Hey, cap. - Yeah?

930
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,010
还有罗伯特 过来看着点
Robert e., you all take over.

931
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,350
我的好侄子
My favorite nephew.

932
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,430
那真是浪费
Now that's just wasteful.

933
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,420
你好 罗斯安娜・麦考伊
Hello, roseanna McCoy.

934
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,390
我叫约翰斯・哈特菲尔德
I'm johnse Hatfield.

935
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,200
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

936
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,230
是表示你懒得搭理我吗?
Does that mean you won't talk to me?

937
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,330
就因为我是哈特菲尔德家的
Me bein' a Hatfield and all.

938
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,830
我没特别针对你
I don't mean you no harm.

939
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,200
是吗 可我就是这么觉得
Well, now, that's the way I feel.

940
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,310
我不明白干嘛弄那么麻烦
You know, I don't see why there's been so much trouble.

941
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,670
我打赌你不知道我也曾姓麦考伊
I bet you didn't know I was named for a McCoy.

942
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,480
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

943
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,550
想去看看西弗吉尼亚的
Hey, you want to go see the second most beautiful sight

944
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,720
第二美景吗?
in west virginia?

945
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,420
我是不是该问问
So then am I supposed to ask

946
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,050
第一美景是什么?
what's the first most beautiful sight?

947
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,620
当然 如果你想看的话
Well, if you wanna go.

948
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,480
那你就会说 远在天边 近在眼前
Then you're just gonna say, "oh, you are."

949
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,220
就像你跟埃洛伊丝・詹金斯
Just like you told eloise jenkins

950
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,130
还有其他无数女孩说的一样
and about a dozen other girls.

951
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,530
我早听过你那些风流事
I've heard all about you.

952
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,300
要是关于我的谣言都是真的话
Well, if all the gossip about me was true,

953
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,910
我早是个长犄角还甩尾巴的怪物了
hell, I'd have horns and a spiny tail.

954
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,540
你穿的这什么靴子
Those are some mighty interesting boots

955
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,250
有意思
you're wearing.

956
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:59,090
- 你喜欢? - 不 我没那么说
- You like 'em? - No, I didn't say that.

957
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,050
那...
So...

958
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,450
西弗吉尼亚的
What is the second most beautiful sight

959
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,590
第二美景在哪呢?
in west virginia?

960
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,720
现在 我就带你去
Well, now, i'll take you there.

961
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,220
- 你郑重发誓吗? - 是的
- Do you solemnly swear? - Yeah.

962
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,730
谢谢 哈特菲尔德先生
Thank you, Mr. Hatfield.

963
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,620
这对忙碌的家庭主妇来说实在是一种恩惠
This really is a boon to busy housewives.

964
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:44,360
你一定会对它相见恨晚
You'll wonder how you got by without one of these.

965
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,730
有了我这种申请过专利的排气阀
You'll never fear a scalding explosion

966
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,260
和这个可变压力计
with our patent release valve

967
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,860
您就再也不用担心被烫伤了
and the variometric pressure gauge.

968
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,230
兰德尔 很不错吧?
Oh, randall, isn't it just fine?

969
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,350
谢谢你的讲解
Thanks for the demonstration.

970
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,700
蒸汽压力锅
Steam digester.

971
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,140
可以节省时间的发明
Time-saving application...

972
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,880
真是个蠢玩意儿
It's a silly trinket.

973
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:03,980
没有这什么双层压力锅
I've been puttin' food on the table all these years

974
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,180
这些年我也照样做出饭菜
without I had me some pressurized double boiler.

975
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,750
哈特菲尔德能满足他老婆任何要求
Hatfield can offer his wife any new contraption she wants.

976
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,390
总有一天我也会给你买个小神奇回来
One day I'm gonna buy you some miracle,

977
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,860
比如爱迪生・费勒发明的电暖炉
like that edison feller's electric fire.

978
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,190
他爹 我才不需要那东西的
Poppy, I don't need anything like that.

979
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,530
你需要的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

980
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,290
总有一天 莎莉 我要给你买个
Someday, sally, i'm gonna buy you

981
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,630
三项插头的双层压力锅
a double boiler that runs on electrical-tricity.

982
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,510
这小提琴卖多少钱?
How much you want for the fiddle?

983
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,630
那是我的
It's mine.

984
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,770
我要一块五
I want a greenback and a half for it.

985
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,510
给你50美分
I'll give you four bits.

986
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,170
是从我奶奶那传下来的
It were my grandpappy's.

987
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,710
75美分
75 cents.

988
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,960
欠你二十五美分 再把酒给我满上
I'll owe you a quarter and you fill my cup.

989
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:48,190
这是我的蒸馏装置
Oh, yeah, this here's my drip still.

990
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,720
了不起吧?
Ain't she a beauty?

991
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,660
我能生产 大概...
I could produce maybe...

992
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,870
我不确定 一天半加仑
I don't know- A half gallon a day

993
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,260
上好的西弗吉尼亚玉米威士忌
of fine western virginia corn liquor.

994
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,290
这是上好的蒸馏装置
I mean, this is the horse's head still,

995
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,940
然后钞票自然来 你懂得
a cash can, you know.

996
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,010
这是我自己建造的
I built this rig myself.

997
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,740
我从老爹那借钱买的这些部件
I mean, I borrowed the money to buy the parts from my pa.

998
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:13,250
为了活个人样
I figure, make a good livin',

999
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,450
以后好养家糊口
support my family proper.

1000
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,150
没准以后就在离这不远的地方
I may even build me a cabin not far from here

1001
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,400
为我和我妻子建一栋小屋让她在那安胎
for my wife to have babies in.

1002
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,570
你有妻子了?
You got yourself a wife?

1003
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,500
你这是寻我开心呐 
Come on. You're teasing me, I know.

1004
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,830
我只知道一个事实
Well, one thing I know for a fact:

1005
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,700
你有一车皮的女朋友
you got girlfriends by the bushel.

1006
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:41,710
我对她们都不是认真的
I ain't serious about none of 'em.

1007
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,850
瞧那傻蛋
Look at that mush-head.

1008
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,750
真想按住那小牛犊子把他呛死
You're s'posed to drown the runt of the litter.

1009
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,540
像这样...
Like this...

1010
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,360
这呢 过来
Here. Come on.

1011
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,260
人多才有乐子嘛 是吧?
Easy to laugh in a bunch, ain't it?

1012
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,300
跟我来
Come on.

1013
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,700
你姐姐呢?
Where's your sister?

1014
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:07,630
我不知道她去哪儿了
Oh, I don't know where she went.

1015
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,640
去找找
Well, go find her.

1016
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,840
我们得走了
We're leavin'.

1017
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:14,310
让她再玩会儿吧 兰德尔
Let her stay, randall.

1018
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,740
小伙子们会送她回去的
The boys will bring her home.

1019
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,710
托尔伯特
Tolbert!

1020
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,320
务必要把罗斯安娜带回来 听见没?
You're to bring roseanna home without fail, ya hear me?

1021
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,920
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1022
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:34,280
你接吻过几次?
How many times you been kissed?

1023
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,270
祖母之类的不算吗?
Not countin' grandmas and such?

1024
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,940
不算
Not countin'.

1025
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,700
大概就几次吧
A couple times, maybe.

1026
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:49,780
我打赌你从未试过真正的吻
I bet you ain't never really truly been kissed right.

1027
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,820
不是我吹牛 但...
Not to boast, but...

1028
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,750
大家都知道我是个接吻高手
I believe I have a strong reputation as a good kisser.

1029
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,390
好了
There.

1030
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,350
现在你可以说你接过吻了
Now you can't say you've never been kissed.

1031
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,690
天哪 天都黑了
Good lord, it's gettin' dark.

1032
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,960
我们得走了
We ought to get goin'.

1033
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,360
罗斯安娜! 罗斯安娜!
Roseanna! Roseanna!

1034
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:43,930
罗斯安娜! 
Roseanna!

1035
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,770
罗斯安娜 我们要走了!
Roseanna, we are leaving!

1036
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,630
她不在这儿
She ain't here.

1037
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,870
一定是和麦克林托克家的人
Must have rode back with the mcclintocks

1038
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:49,600
或克莱因一起回去了
or Mr. Cline.

1039
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,140
怎么也不跟我们说一声
Well, she could have told us.

1040
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,570
爸爸会骂死我们的
Pa's gonna take our damn heads off.

1041
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,980
罗斯安娜!
Roseanna!

1042
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,840
罗斯安娜 最后机会!
Roseanna, last chance!

1043
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,910
罗斯安娜!
Roseanna!

1044
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,000
最后机会 罗斯安娜!
Last chance, roseanna!

1045
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:12,390
噢 保佑他们还在
Oh, please let them be here. Please.

1046
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,430
噢不
Oh, no.

1047
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,200
噢 不!
Oh, no!

1048
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:20,930
不瞒你说 都走了 连你的亲戚们也走了 
Upon my honor, they's all gone, even your kinsfolk.

1049
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,770
噢 天哪
Oh, god.

1050
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,510
爸爸会杀了我的
My poppy is gonna kill me.

1051
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,050
我该怎么回家?
How am I gonna get home?

1052
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,850
我带你回家
Well, I'll take you with me.

1053
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,480
我是麦考伊家的
My name is McCoy.

1054
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:42,190
你父亲不会欢迎任何一个麦考伊家的人
Your father would hardly welcome one of us.

1055
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,490
不管你听到了什么关于恶魔昂斯・哈特菲尔德
You put everything you heard about devil anse Hatfield

1056
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,690
都不要相信
out of your pretty head.

1057
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,270
他不是那样的人
He ain't nothing like that.

1058
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,160
我就吩咐你们这么一件事
One thing I said to do without fail

1059
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:52,700
务必把你们妹妹带回来!
was bring your sister home!

1060
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,970
我们以为她搭马车回家了
We figured she got a ride home.

1061
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,170
我们怎么知道?
How was we to know?

1062
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,670
我们找过了! 大喊她名字!
We tried! We called out!

1063
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,070
她没有回答!
She didn't answer!

1064
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,410
我说过务必!
I said without fail!

1065
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,110
出去找她
Go find her.

1066
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,200
找不到就别回来了
And don't come back till you do.

1067
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:07,050
只有蠢货
Only a goddamn idiot

1068
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,130
才会把兰德尔・麦考伊的女儿带回来
would bring randall McCoy's daughter back here,

1069
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,820
还是大半夜的
and after midnight.

1070
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:12,950
黑漆漆的晚上 她一个人
Well, she couldn't very well walk back home

1071
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,880
要怎么走回家
in the dark by herself.

1072
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,520
你不想她待在这 没关系 但...
You don't want her here, that's fine, but...

1073
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:22,230
别再过分责备我
Don't strike me as overgenerous.

1074
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,600
该死 我会骑马把她送回家的
Shit, I'll hitch a wagon, ride her back home.

1075
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,930
她哪儿也不去
You ain't ridin' her nowheres.

1076
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,770
如果被兰德尔・麦考伊看到
The way you make this predicament worse

1077
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,840
大晚上的你和他的女儿单独在一起 
is for randall McCoy to see you

1078
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,640
只会让事情更糟
with his daughter afore sunrise.

1079
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,740
他会打爆你的头 而我只会觉得是你活该
He'll shoot your damn head off, and I wouldn't blame him.

1080
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,820
那你让我怎么做?
What do you want me to do?

1081
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,210
我让你离她远一点
I want you to stay away off o' her, that's what.

1082
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,550
莉瓦西 让女孩们为我们的客人
Levicy, have the girls make down a pallet

1083
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,090
在地板上铺张草垫
on the floor for our guest.

1084
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,960
天一亮 你就把她带到拖轮河谷边界
Come mornin', you take her to the edge of the tug

1085
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,790
然后让她自己走
and then leave her off.

1086
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,250
遵命
Yes, sir.

1087
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,900
还有把你花里胡哨的靴子给我换了
And then get rid of them fancy-nancy boots.

1088
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:59,210
一点男人样都没有
You're supposed to be a workin' man.

1089
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,250
漂亮姑娘
Good-lookin' girl.

1090
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,310
这可不值得我们去惹麻烦
Yeah, well, it don't make it worth the goddamn trouble.

1091
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,000
等麦考伊发现真相的时候 他脸上的表情
The look on McCoy's face when he finds out,

1092
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,610
倒是值得一看
that'll be worth seeing.

1093
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,920
继续练你的琴吧
You just keep practicin'.

1094
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,420
要不换个调
Maybe a different tune.

1095
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,080
嘘 继续睡觉
Shh. Go back to sleep.

1096
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,390
嗨 嘘
Hi. Shh.

1097
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,120
到了我们的蜜月
Oh, and on our honeymoon,

1098
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:48,950
我们就来次真正的火车旅行
we're gonna take a real train ride

1099
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,160
走遍大江南北直到我们精疲力尽
all the way across the country till we can't go no more.

1100
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,690
我在书上读到俄勒冈州涨潮期的海洋最美最蓝
I read where they got this great blue ocean up in oregon.

1101
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,460
这东西大到你无法想象
I mean, this thing's so big and wide,

1102
01:10:58,710 --> 01:10:59,850
一望无际
you can't even see the other side.

1103
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,680
你哭了?
You cryin'?

1104
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,890
为什么?
What on earth for?

1105
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,330
我只想知道为何选择我作为你漫长旅途的伴侣
Just wonderin' where I fit in on this long list of conquests.

1106
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,150
我美丽 甜蜜的宝贝
My beautiful, sweet darlin'.

1107
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,520
你觉得我是在玩弄你?
You think I'm toyin' with you?

1108
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:23,860
我不知该作何感想
I don't know what to think.

1109
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,820
这是我的初夜
This is my first time.

1110
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,630
我一直想留给我未来的丈夫
I was savin' myself for a husband,

1111
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,700
就像上帝告诉我那样
just like god told me to.

1112
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:34,300
我是认真的 罗斯安娜
I ain't foolin' here, roseanna.

1113
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:36,330
我要娶你为妻
I intend to marry you.

1114
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,710
要不是我答应了我爸爸
If I hadn't promised my pa,

1115
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,810
我会立马冲过这条河
hell, I'd ride on across that river right now,

1116
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,630
对你父亲屈膝乞求他的同意
and on bended knee, i'd ask your daddy myself.

1117
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,550
下来
Come here.

1118
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,800
为娶你为妻 我不惜与世界为敌
I'd go up against the whole world to make you my wife.

1119
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,800
我不能改变我的过去或者我的亲人
And I can't change my past or our kin,

1120
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:01,530
但我告诉你
but I tell you true,

1121
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,190
我从未对任何人有过这样的感觉
I ain't never felt like this before

1122
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,360
直到你的出现
about nobody else but you.

1123
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,170
她在那
There she is.

1124
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,190
那个约翰斯・哈特菲尔德正在吻她
That's johnse Hatfield a'kissin' on her.

1125
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,460
狗娘养的!
That son of a bitch!

1126
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,420
你快回去吧
Now get over there.

1127
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,840
你告诉他
You tell him.

1128
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,740
好
Okay.

1129
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,020
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye.

1130
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,190
我不敢走那座桥
I don't wanna cross that bridge.

1131
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,070
我会在这看着你
I'll be here when you get back.

1132
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,320
你跑不掉了 约翰斯!
Y'ain't gettin' away, johnse!

1133
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,600
哦 我的天哪! 约翰斯!
Oh, my god! Johnse!

1134
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,820
约翰斯 是我的兄弟们
Johnse, it's my brothers!

1135
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,320
走! 快走!
Go! Go on!

1136
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:56,790
我爱你 罗斯安娜!
I love you, roseanna!

1137
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:57,750
驾!
Ha!

1138
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:00,690
等等! 等等! 停!
Wait! Wait! Stop!

1139
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,030
停下来! 别伤害他!
Stop! Don't hurt him!

1140
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,420
他什么都没做!
He didn't do nothing!

1141
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,460
巴迪 你快阻止他们!
Buddy, buddy, you gotta stop 'em!

1142
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,180
爸爸让我们带你回去
We gotta get you to poppy.

1143
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,050
我什么都没做!
I didn't do nothing!

1144
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,820
抓住他!
Get him!

1145
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,870
你死定了!
You're a dead man!

1146
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,960
该死的 托尔伯特!
God damn it, tolbert!

1147
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,040
你在火大什么?
What you so hot about, anyway?

1148
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,410
是你扔下罗斯安娜一个人回不了家的
You're the one that left roseanna with no way home.

1149
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,170
我只是为她提供了庇护所和食物
All I did was give her shelter, feed her dinner,

1150
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,840
让她免受伤害!
and keep her safe from harm!

1151
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,510
你用你一贯作风调戏她了?
You try to have your way with her?

1152
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,070
没有 先生!
No, sir!

1153
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,780
她昨晚和我妹妹们一起睡的
She spent the night with my sisters.

1154
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:57,880
你也看见她现在安然无恙了
You saw her-safe and sound.

1155
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,920
如果我强迫了她
You think she'd be kissin' on me

1156
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,890
她还会吻我吗?
if I had violated her in any way?

1157
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:02,810
我确实听到罗斯安娜说...
I did hear roseanna say...

1158
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,890
闭嘴 卡尔文
Shut up, calvin.

1159
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,960
我们现在杀了他 然后在被发现之前
Now, I say we kill him now and t geon back across the river

1160
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,730
迅速穿过河回家
before anyone knows.

1161
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,730
听着 你们妹妹知道
Hell, your sister'll know.

1162
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:11,860
她爱我
She loves me.

1163
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,610
谎话连篇 满嘴狗屎!
That's a load of bull manure!

1164
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,830
不 不是
No, it ain't.

1165
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,500
他妈的我也爱她 
And I love her too, god damn it.

1166
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,960
看来我得证明给你们看
Since I got to prove it to you.

1167
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,210
你的枪伤有多严重 约翰斯?
Well, how bad you shot, johnse?

1168
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,410
这...这个...
Ha... Well...

1169
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,550
我会活下来的
I'll live.

1170
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,450
想想子弹都射穿了我的身体
Think the bullet tore straight through me.

1171
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,820
托尔伯特 我们走
Tolbert, let's go.

1172
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,920
走吧
Come on.

1173
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,490
告诉你们爸爸
You tell your pa

1174
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,080
我要娶罗斯安娜为妻!
I want to ask roseanna's hand in marriage!

1175
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,930
嘿 爸爸! 我们找到她了!
Hey, pa! We found her!

1176
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,500
我们找到她了!
We found her!

1177
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,620
找到罗斯安娜了!
I got roseanna!

1178
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,460
你在哈特菲尔德屋檐下过了一晚?
You spent the night under a Hatfield roof?

1179
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,950
和约翰斯的妹妹们在一起
With johnse's sisters, sir.

1180
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,800
哈特菲尔德先生好心收留我
Mr. Hatfield kindly gave permission.

1181
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:20,810
约翰斯 他...他想娶我
Johnse, he, uh- He wants to marry me.

1182
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,100
你说什么?
Beg your damn pardon?

1183
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,800
他爱我 爸爸
He loves me, poppy.

1184
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:30,110
他想取得你的同意
He wants to ask you proper, you know.

1185
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,570
他想让一切都名正言顺
He wants to make sure it's right.

1186
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,200
他碰了你 罗斯安娜?
He touch you, roseanna?

1187
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,770
没有
No.

1188
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,690
随便你
You go on.

1189
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,100
你想做什么我都不管
Do whatever you want.

1190
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,730
这么喜欢哈特菲尔德家的人
You like the Hatfields so much,

1191
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,910
你干嘛不永远跟他们待在一起?
why don't you go stay with them forever?

1192
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,930
从此以后我们断绝父女关系
You're not my daughter anymore.

1193
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,510
你得让拉瑟福德来看看
You'll have to have rutherford take a look at this.

1194
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,640
不用 没关系
No, it's fine.

1195
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:39,640
噢!
Ow!

1196
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,510
你手拿开
Keep your hand out of the way.

1197
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,980
他跟你做的没什么两样
He's gonna do the same thing you're doing.

1198
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,420
爸爸 她父亲没有反对
Daddy, her father don't object.

1199
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:48,230
看起来是谁打伤了你
Well, looks like somebody did.

1200
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,820
是啊 她愚蠢的兄弟们 噢!
Yeah, her boneheaded brothers-ow!

1201
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,060
别动行吗?
Would you hold still?

1202
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,560
我没听错吧
I want to hear again that randall McCoy

1203
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,990
兰德尔・麦考伊同意把女儿嫁给你
agreed to you marrying his daughter.

1204
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,760
不 不完全正确
No, not exactly.

1205
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,230
他说他不在乎
He said he don't care.

1206
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,570
他不在乎
He don't care.

1207
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,120
"不在乎"可算不上是同意
"Don't care" ain't permission.

1208
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,410
他在众人面前说的
Well, he said it in front of witnesses.

1209
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:15,350
在你受枪伤之前还是之后 嗯?
Well, was that before or after you got shot, hmm?

1210
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,080
事关他的女儿 我可不想激怒麦考伊或任何人
I will not defy McCoy or any man when it comes to his daughter.

1211
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,690
爸爸 拜托了 如果你...
Daddy, please, if you...

1212
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:24,640
如果你能同意
If you give permission,

1213
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,390
他也会慢慢接受的
he'll surely come around.

1214
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,130
去他妈的 孩子! 他们想杀了你!
God damn it, boy! They tried to kill you!

1215
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,360
现在你还想娶个那样的?
Now you want to marry into that?

1216
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:35,570
不是这样的
You know what? This ain't right.

1217
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,280
我和她想结为夫妻...
Me and her want to be man and wife...

1218
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,140
我们都到结婚的年龄了
Now, we're both of age.

1219
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:43,920
别傻了 你才遇到她不久
Don't be a fool. You only just met her.

1220
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:48,180
妈妈...
Mama...

1221
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,870
罗斯安娜已经被赶出家门了
Roseanna's been throwed out.

1222
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,500
她无处可去
She got no place to go.

1223
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,380
你这是在自找罪受 孩子
You're afflicted, son.

1224
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:06,330
好吧
All right.

1225
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:10,170
她可以留在这等她家族来找她
She can stay here until her family comes for her

1226
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,560
或者你俩恢复理智了
or you two come to your senses.

1227
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:12,770
谢谢
Thank you.

1228
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,240
谢谢你 妈妈
Thank you, mama.

1229
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:19,400
但她要保留自己的姓
But she will keep her own name.

1230
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,800
快来
Come on.

1231
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:35,790
噢 小心那条蛇
Oh, watch out for that snake.

1232
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,240
我开玩笑的
I'm just kiddin' ya.

1233
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,130
我从没见过这般美景
I never knew this existed.

1234
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,230
欢迎进入我的生活
Been comin' here my whole life.

1235
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,870
这地方是如此美丽
It's so beautiful out here.

1236
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,430
是的
Yup.

1237
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,690
你在干什么?
What are you doin'?

1238
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,760
我的天 约翰斯 你疯了
Oh, my-you are crazy, Johnse.

1239
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,820
来和我一起戏水吧
Come get in the water with me.

1240
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:19,990
在这里?
Out here?

1241
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,670
在上帝的眼皮底下?
In the eyes of god?

1242
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:24,700
反对我们的又不是上帝
God didn't forbid our union.

1243
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:28,070
是我们的父亲
Our fathers did.

1244
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,060
上帝知道在我们心中 彼此早已成婚
God knows we're married in our hearts.

1245
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,430
来吧
Come on.

1246
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,050
待会见 好吗?
See you later, all right?

1247
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,560
什么事?
What's the matter?

1248
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:26,340
哈特菲尔德亲戚
Hatfield kin.

1249
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:30,450
普莱恩错了
Plain ain't right.

1250
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,870
一年多了 罗斯安娜还住在哈特菲尔德家里
Over a year now Roseanna's livin' under the Hatfield roof,

1251
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,240
脱掉裙子 然后摇身变成
droppin' her skirt and turnin' out to be

1252
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:38,200
任宰任割的鱼肉
just a steady piece of cake.

1253
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,110
这一定让哈特菲尔德那老头
Must make old man Hatfield

1254
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,170
快活得像只鸡舍里的公鸡
happier'n a banty rooster in a henhouse,

1255
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,880
那让我们家族蒙羞
having our family so disgraced.

1256
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,000
是的
Yup.

1257
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:55,820
有何贵干?
Help ya?

1258
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,020
我是弗兰克・菲利普斯
Frank Phillips.

1259
01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:00,630
在肯塔基州路易斯维尔镇平克顿办公室做事
Work outta the Pinkerton office, Pouisville, Kentucky.

1260
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,060
我在找鲍勃・莱温格
Lookin' for Bob Levinger.

1261
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,710
轮班时没看见鲍勃
Ain't seen Bob in a spell.

1262
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,640
要是对一个平克顿的 
A fella could get himself into a lot of trouble

1263
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,740
持有美国副检察官证的人撒谎
lyin' to a Pinkerton man

1264
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:16,620
那人会惹上一身腥的
with a US Deputy prosecutor warrant.

1265
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,950
这足以构成犯罪了
It makes it a federal offense.

1266
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,790
我们可以谈谈监狱和罚金
So we're talkin' prison, a big fine.

1267
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,890
有人会失去他的小酒馆
A feller could lose his saloon,

1268
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,230
以及所有打拼来的东西
everything he's slaved for.

1269
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,960
等出狱时 他就是个穷光蛋
Time he's outta jail, he's dead broke.

1270
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:41,770
老婆和某个花心的投机家跑了
His wife's run off with some dandy carpetbagger.

1271
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:47,040
我见过这种事
I seen it happen.

1272
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:50,240
那个玩纸牌的光头
Playin' cards, bald one.

1273
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,460
鲍勃・莱温格
Bob levinger.

1274
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,460
你没有房屋居住证
You got no paper on where you're livin'.

1275
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,430
房子违章搭建 也没缴税
Squatter, payin' no taxes.

1276
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,900
书信警告过两次 其中一次是联邦官员发出的
You've been warned twice by mail, once by federal officer.

1277
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:17,970
你得跟我走一趟
I'm here to take you in.

1278
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:21,170
这是拘捕令
This here's a warrant.

1279
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,110
这不合法
Ain't legal.

1280
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,350
那是哈特菲尔德的地盘
That land is Hatfield.

1281
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,270
莱温格是哈特菲尔德的表亲
Levingers is cousins to Hatfield.

1282
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,050
我敬爱的叔叔恶魔昂斯
My great uncle Devil Anse,

1283
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,050
国土办公室有他登记在案的房屋证明
he got papers on file at the land state office.

1284
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,850
一派胡言
Bullshit.

1285
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,950
那是政府的财产
It's federal property.

1286
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,740
你们这些人以为住在这 就拥有了土地
You people think you're on the land, you own it.

1287
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:44,410
我可不赞同你的说法
I'm sayin' that ain't right.

1288
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,000
你可以在法庭上慢慢说
You can tell your story in court.

1289
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,540
我认为我不用跟你走
I don't feel like goin' nowheres.

1290
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:51,500
我的弟弟埃德就站在你的后面
My little brother Ed's standing behind you,

1291
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:56,310
拿着一支正规的海军手枪
and he got a regular navy pistol.

1292
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,800
你觉得我还需要跟你走吗?
You still think i'm goin' somewheres?

1293
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,100
找到一颗
Got one.

1294
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:29,240
另一颗找不到
Can't find the other.

1295
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:31,340
再深一点 可能就会要了你的命
Go much deeper, I might kill you.

1296
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:35,880
当然 若你想的话 我可以再试一次
'course, if you want, I'll give it another try.

1297
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,280
你准备去找那个警探吗?
You going after that pinker?

1298
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:40,050
必须去 那混蛋杀了我们的人
Got to. Bastard killed our kin.

1299
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:45,260
吉姆叔叔 我不是在和你说话
I ain't talkin' to you, uncle Jim.

1300
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:49,860
你很清楚莱温格家终会遇到这样的事
You know damn well the Levingers likely had it comin'.

1301
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:52,500
埃德和鲍勃总是一副流氓样
Ed and Bob always was jackasses.

1302
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,100
是啊 但他们就是我们家的流氓
Yeah, but they're our jackasses.

1303
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:59,910
有些人认为能对我们的族人开枪
Someone thinks they can take a shot at our kin,

1304
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,080
很快别人又觉得他们可以设下埋伏
pretty soon someone else thinks they can lay an ambush

1305
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,950
枪杀我们的人
and shoot at one of us.

1306
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,610
嘿 你记我们还是小孩子时
Hey, do you remember when we was kids,

1307
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:12,180
爸爸叫我去打死那只鸡舍附近到处嗅的狐狸
pa told me to go shoot that fox nosing around the henhouse.

1308
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:13,350
是的
Yeah.

1309
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,590
你不想杀死它
You didn't want to kill it.

1310
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,560
你还因此嘲笑我
You poked fun at me for it.

1311
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,830
却帮我捉住它 然后就能带它过河
Helped me trap it so's we could take it across the river

1312
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,200
放它走
and let it go.

1313
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,000
它再没来过
Never come around again.

1314
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,310
爸爸他不是一个聪明人
And pa, he was none the wiser.

1315
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:31,370
嗯...
Well...

1316
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,320
我要说的是
All I'm sayin' is,

1317
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,240
你如此聪明
smart as you are,

1318
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:40,250
或许会找到另一个法子
maybe you can figure out another way.

1319
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,450
艾利生 我听到了 但你要知道
I hear you, Ellison, but you should know the reason

1320
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,420
那狐狸之所以没再来
that fox didn't ever come around again.

1321
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:51,120
因为你回家后 我杀了它
After you went home, I killed it.

1322
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:24,190
安德森是个好人
Anderson is a good man.

1323
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:29,160
我们家族间的恩怨 呃...
This trouble 'tween our families, well...

1324
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:34,400
让我们所有人都很为难
Well, it makes it hard for all of us.

1325
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:39,410
我想告诉你 在我心里
And I got to tell ya, deep down inside,

1326
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:44,430
不看好你和约翰斯在一起
I ain't got no belief in you and Johnse bein' together.

1327
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,380
好吧...
Well...

1328
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:55,220
我们可以在上帝见证下结婚
We can have a union in the sight of god.

1329
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,960
你知道的 我们不会
You know, and children that weren't born

1330
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,420
未婚生子的
on the wrong side of the bed.

1331
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,590
不
No.

1332
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,200
不行
No.

1333
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:08,450
你得回到真正属于你的地方
You need to go back to your own, where you belong.

1334
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:13,110
嘿
Hey.

1335
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,130
其实你心地不坏
I can see you ain't a bad person,

1336
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:18,590
但这整件事完全不合理
and this whole thing, it ain't right.

1337
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,350
你在叫我离开?
You askin' me to leave?

1338
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,100
而且最好不要回来
And don't you come back.

1339
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,730
你爸爸和安德森之间的争吵
This bullheaded feud between your pa and my Anderson,

1340
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,900
就像一种慢性毒药
it's a kind of slow poison.

1341
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:44,110
我继承了五百亩地
I inherited 500 acres,

1342
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,640
我会传给你
which I would pass along to you

1343
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,670
作为你的嫁妆
on the occasion of your marriage.

1344
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,480
但我的土地决不能落入哈特菲尔德手中
But my land will never be in Hatfield hands,

1345
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:55,410
我向你保证
I can promise you that.

1346
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:59,420
妈妈 现在你不用担心了
Don't worry yourself now, mama.

1347
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:04,670
约翰斯和我永远都不会结婚的
Johnse and me ain't never gonna get married.

1348
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:08,360
和哈特菲尔德家玷污你的人断绝关系
Renounce your Hatfield defiler,

1349
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:12,460
你爸爸或许就会让你回家
and your poppy might let you come home.

1350
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:17,340
你曾是他最喜欢的女儿
You used to be his favorite.

1351
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:19,040
到时候你会遇见一个合适的男孩
In time, you'll meet a suitable boy.

1352
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:20,140
妈妈...
Mama-

1353
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,140
你...你...
And you-you-

1354
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,780
太迟了
It's too late.

1355
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:31,470
我已经两个月没来月事了
I ain't had my flow in two months.

1356
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:38,620
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

1357
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:43,210
你怀着哈特菲尔德小杂种回的家?
You come home with a Hatfield bastard in your belly?

1358
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,300
嘿 妈妈
Hey, mama.

1359
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:52,600
罗斯安娜在哪?
Where's Roseanna?

1360
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,510
回她家族那里了
Gone to her family.

1361
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,710
她什么时候回来?
Well, when she comin' back?

1362
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,450
不知道她会不会
I don't know that she will.

1363
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,730
她不回来 或许对每个人都好
Might be best for all concerned if she don't.

1364
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,600
我有七百亩的玉米地
Got 700 acres of corn,

1365
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:23,770
有拖轮叉锯木场12%的股份
12% of the tug fork sawmill,

1366
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:28,540
还有价值近一万美元的票据
and nearly 10,000 in financial instruments.

1367
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:30,880
我唯独缺一个帮手
Only I lack a helpmate,

1368
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,810
一个我爱的妻子来分享财产
a loving wife to share my good fortune.

1369
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,350
我确定会有很多女人
I'm sure that any number of women

1370
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,220
会很乐意迎合你的需求
would be happy to entertain your suit.

1371
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:41,440
我不在乎那些女人
Any number I don't care for.

1372
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:43,390
如果你担心肉体关系方面的事
If you're worried about the physical relations,

1373
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,460
我可以忘...
I could forego...

1374
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:45,780
佩里 我不能和你结婚
I can't marry you, Perry.

1375
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,790
我怀孕了...
I'm having a baby...

1376
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,320
是约翰斯・哈特菲尔德的孩子
Johnse Hatfield's child.

1377
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,670
真是不幸
That's unfortunate.

1378
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,770
不过我们快点结婚的话
But if we're to marry quickly,

1379
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:04,740
没人会注意孩子不是我的这一悲催事实
no one would catch on to the sad truth the child ain't mine.

1380
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:08,280
否则 你会变成人们的闲话
Otherwise, your condition will be all the gossip, you know,

1381
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:10,880
哈特菲尔德家族的人会取笑这事
the Hatfields laughin' about it.

1382
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,180
我爱上了约翰斯・哈特菲尔德
I'm in love with Johnse Hatfield.

1383
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:31,770
贝蒂阿姨?
Aunt Betty?

1384
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,540
噢!
Oh!

1385
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:38,480
老天啊 你吓着我了
Sakes alive, you scared me.

1386
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,180
甜心 你来这里干什么呢?
What are you doin' here, sugar?

1387
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,750
妈妈说你会收留我
Mama said you'd take me in.

1388
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,200
没有人想要我了
Ain't nobody else want me.

1389
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:20,610
我们在找一个叫弗兰克・菲利普斯的男人
Lookin' for a gentleman, name of Frank Phillips.

1390
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,960
你找他什么事?
What's your business with him?

1391
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:30,170
那肯定是瘸腿恶人弗兰克・菲利普斯
That there must be bad Frank Phillips with that limp.

1392
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,340
我姓菲利普斯 但我不叫瘸腿恶人
I go by the name of Phillips, not the other part.

1393
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,260
如果我是你 就会管住自己的嘴
So if I was you, i'd mind my tongue.

1394
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,970
好吧 你是因为腿瘸了而脾气暴躁?
Well, ain't you ornery for a cripple?

1395
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,680
我得好好教你什么是礼貌
I'd give you a lesson in manners,

1396
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,350
但在我上楼见珍妮璐之前
but the house required I check my sidearms

1397
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,770
赌场要求我检查一下随身武器
'fore I went upstairs with Jenny Lou.

1398
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,750
嗯 这挺糟糕的
Well, that's too bad.

1399
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,150
鉴于你的态度 我或许乐意看看
Given your attitude, I might like seeing

1400
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,160
你用起它们来能有多灵活
how good you could use 'em.

1401
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,460
老头 去问问
Well, ask your dead

1402
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:52,110
你家背后开枪的死人亲戚吧
back-shootin' relatives, old man.

1403
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,760
菲利普斯先生 我是来和你谈判的
Mr. Phillips, I come here to talk to you,

1404
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:58,470
不是来这该死的妓院和你开枪战的
not have a shootout in a damn whorehouse.

1405
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,740
要是我杀了你 我还得向我的妻子解释
After I killed you, I'd have to explain it to my wife,

1406
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:04,450
我并不是很期待那样做 所以...
and I wouldn't much look forward to havin' to do that, so...

1407
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:08,580
相反的 我会请你喝酒
So I'll buy you a drink instead.

1408
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:12,750
哈特菲尔德先生 你就请我喝杯波本威士忌吧
You buy me a bourbon whiskey straight, Mr. Hatfield.

1409
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,280
不过最好让你的走狗留在外面
But you have to leave your dog outside.

1410
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:20,200
他可以留下
He can stay.

1411
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,480
什么风把你吹来和我谈判?
So why did you make the special trip to parley with me?

1412
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:36,740
我付你一百美金 只要...
I come here to give you $100 on condition-

1413
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:40,210
只要你赶紧离开这里
On condition you move on out of these parts.

1414
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,410
我杀了你的族人 为什么还付我钱?
I killed your kin. Why the payoff?

1415
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,050
呃 这不是我的初衷
Well, it wasn't my first idea, I promise you.

1416
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:49,020
你在这里待得越久 那些人...
Longer you stay around here, people-

1417
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,290
那些人就越期待我对你下手
People expect me to do something about you.

1418
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,220
我明白你是在尽你的职责
Now, I understand you were doin' your job,

1419
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:59,160
莱温格家的人 总是最愚蠢的家伙
and Levingers was always damn fool idiots at best,

1420
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,930
但不...不要让我成为你的敌人
but don't-don't make me raise my hand against you,

1421
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,930
菲利普斯先生
Mr. Phillips.

1422
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:07,500
我会杀了你的
I would kill you.

1423
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:12,740
所以拿着我的钱离开吧
So take my money and ride on out.

1424
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:18,720
我会拿走你的钱  但不要觉得我这是逃跑
I'll take your money. Just don't think I'm runnin'.

1425
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,780
你杀了莱温格家的人
You took down the levingers.

1426
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:25,490
别指望能溜走
Didn't expect you to lizard out.

1427
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:28,820
这些个破烂事弄得我全身上下都不给劲
This whole damn thing sticks in my craw,

1428
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:31,750
尤其是受伤的右腿
especially with my bad leg.

1429
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,800
在你的地盘 你的亲戚害我丢了工作
It was your land claim and your kin cost me my job.

1430
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:41,030
臭老九
A skunk's profession.

1431
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,190
拜托你睁眼看看自己有几斤几两
Get yourself into something useful.

1432
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,810
你不能去那儿 约翰斯
You can't go there, johnse.

1433
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,310
你喝醉了只会做蠢事
You're all drunk and crazy.

1434
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,050
我要跟老麦考伊面对面
I'm gonna stare old man McCoy in the eye.

1435
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,230
说清楚
I'm gonna tell him

1436
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,890
直截了当告诉他
I'm gonna tell him straight out.

1437
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,540
你这是去送死
You're gonna get yourself killed.

1438
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,390
别拉着我
Let go of my arm.

1439
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,560
他要去肯塔基州跟老兰德尔・麦考伊见面
He wants to ride into kentucky and see old randall McCoy.

1440
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:10,200
我叫南茜・麦考伊 是罗斯安娜的堂姐
Well, I'm nancy McCoy, roseanna's cousin.

1441
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,500
我得走了
And I-I gotta go.

1442
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,370
听着 你非要去的话
Look, if you go there,

1443
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,200
他们会以为你要伤害他们
they're gonna think you mean 'em harm.

1444
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:17,140
那我就大喊 "我不会伤害任何人!
Well, I'll shout out, "i don't mean you no harm!

1445
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:19,910
我就想讲出心声"
I just-I just wanna talk things out."

1446
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,510
好吧 如果你和我一起去 你就没事
Well, if you go with me, you'll be safe.

1447
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,710
我的马...
Well, my horse...

1448
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,140
我们回来的时候再把马牵走
We'll come on back and get it.

1449
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:33,390
你是罗斯安娜的堂姐南茜
You are-you're roseanna's cousin nancy.

1450
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,310
赶紧的 我刚刚说过
Go on. That's what I said.

1451
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:43,110
噢!
Oh!

1452
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:50,670
我知道你是谁 你长得有点像她
I know who you are, 'cause you look like her, kind of.

1453
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,790
驾!
Yah!

1454
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,470
罗斯安娜的堂姐南茜
Roseanna's cousin nancy.

1455
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:18,810
和晚上相比 现在你看起来
You-you kind of look like roseanna in the daylight too.

1456
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:25,570
要更像罗斯安娜一些
More at night, though.

1457
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:30,810
我昨天拜访了我姑妈贝蒂・布兰肯希普一家
I went and visited my aunt betty blankenship's yesterday.

1458
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,830
我猜你知道你的未婚妻待在那里
I suppose you know your once-intended is stayin' there.

1459
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,870
我不知道
No.

1460
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,750
估计老家伙还在为她和我
Guess the old man's still riled

1461
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,020
使家族蒙羞而暴跳如雷
at how me and her shamed his family.

1462
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:49,260
对啊 尤其是罗斯安娜还怀孕了
Well, especially now that roseanna's with child and all.

1463
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:51,650
什么?
What?

1464
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:58,970
我要做爸爸了?
I'm gonna be a daddy?

1465
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,010
就因为她怀孕了
Because she carries his child,

1466
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,720
罗斯安娜觉得自己爱上了约翰斯・哈特菲尔德
roseanna believes herself in love with johnse Hatfield.

1467
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:06,990
爸爸知道这事了吗?
Does our pap know about this?

1468
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,880
就他现在的身体状况 
Strong as he is,

1469
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,020
我担心这事会要了你老头的命
I fear it may break your father's heart.

1470
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:12,610
在他发现之前 
Shame we can't remedy the situation

1471
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:15,890
我们一点补救措施都没有 真特么丧气
before he finds out.

1472
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,790
如果没有约翰斯
If it weren't for johnse,

1473
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,160
罗斯安娜也许能保持理智
roseanna might come to her senses

1474
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:22,760
接受订好的婚约
and accept an offer of honorable marriage.

1475
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:25,170
- 咱们走 - 赶紧的
- Let's go. - Come on.

1476
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:27,800
嗨...
Hey...

1477
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:29,630
你们要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1478
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:31,400
孩子们
Boys.

1479
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,100
孩子们!
Boys!

1480
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:35,190
你们这是要去哪儿啊?
Where are you going?

1481
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,100
很好...
Well...

1482
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:01,030
我正想找你们
Just the boys I wanna see.

1483
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,270
咱们可以一起去你们姑妈贝蒂家
You can ride with me to your aunt betty's house.

1484
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,840
我要去那儿解救我的新娘
I'm going there to rescue my bride,

1485
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,300
给她一个名分
make an honest woman of her.

1486
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:10,510
闭上你的狗嘴!
Just you shut the hell up!

1487
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,550
少来你这套骗人的把戏
You ain't lyin' your way out of it this time.

1488
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,280
我没骗人
I ain't lying.

1489
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:19,120
我才得知罗斯安娜怀了我的孩子
Just found out roseanna's carrying my baby.

1490
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,290
所以我立马赶去找她
So I'm going to get her,

1491
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,690
咱老爸看到肯定会气得冒烟
seeing as how our daddies are being such horses' asses.

1492
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:31,930
你死定了 哈特菲尔德 你别想活着离开!
You're dead, Hatfield. You're gonna be dead!

1493
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:34,070
别碰我 托尔伯特!
Get off of me, tolbert!

1494
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,270
你为啥要跟你未来的妹夫过不去?
Why you want to hurt your future brother-in-law?

1495
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,910
我要杀了你 你毁了我妹妹的清白!
I'm gonna kill you, 'cause you soiled my sister's honor!

1496
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,960
我都说了 我要和她结婚!
I told you, i'm gonna marry her!

1497
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:02,230
卡尔文?
Calvin?

1498
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,960
兰德尔?
Randall?

1499
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:06,970
你在干嘛?
What's-what are you doing?

1500
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,830
爱丽菲尔 让孩子们回房间
Alifair, get the kids back.

1501
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,150
快 快啊!
Git. Git!

1502
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,240
你这是干嘛?
What are you doin'?

1503
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:16,170
你喝醉了?
Are you drunk?

1504
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,870
你打算瞒着我 对吧?
You weren't gonna tell me, were ya?

1505
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:23,820
我听佩里・克莱因说了
I had to hear it from Perry Cline.

1506
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,680
停下 那是罗斯安娜的嫁妆箱
Well, stop. That's roseanna's hope chest.

1507
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:26,690
停下来!
Stop!

1508
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,170
我知道是里面装的是什么!
I know what it is!

1509
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,350
估计你在奇怪我为什么没直接要你小命
Suppose you's wonderin' why I don't kill you straight away.

1510
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,720
因为你知道这样做不对
'Cause you know it ain't right.

1511
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:42,730
放狗屁!
Horseshit!

1512
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:47,110
就像在部队里一样
I'm gonna blow your brains out exactly at sunrise,

1513
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,940
天一亮 我就一枪崩了你
like they do in the army.

1514
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:51,980
我就是要你眼睁睁的等死
See, I want you to know it's comin'.

1515
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:55,830
我要你一直被恐惧折磨
And I want you to think about it for all those hours!

1516
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,380
让你也尝尝
Feel the kind of torment

1517
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,580
你和哈特菲尔德家族的人给我们带来的痛苦
you and all the Hatfields have brought down on us.

1518
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:04,560
我是尊重你妹妹的 托尔伯特
I respect your sister, tolbert.

1519
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:07,230
你知道的
You know that.

1520
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,660
更何况她现在怀有我的骨肉
Especially now that she's carrying my baby.

1521
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,210
让我去找个牧师来主持我和她的婚礼
Let me go find a preacher and make it legal.

1522
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,090
现在说这些太晚了!
Well, it's too late for that!

1523
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,940
黎明时分 就是你的死期
I'm gonna shoot you dead come dawn,

1524
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,640
我会整点报时
and I'm gonna tell you what time it is

1525
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:22,640
让你知道你离死神越来越近!
every hour we get closer!

1526
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:29,400
我死前能提最后一个请求吗?
Instead of a last meal, can I-can I get a last request?

1527
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:32,080
去你妈的 不行!
Hell, no!

1528
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:33,690
你想要什么?
What do you want?

1529
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:36,760
我想见罗斯安娜最后一面
I want to see roseanna one last time.

1530
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:39,700
我想郑重跟她说一声再见
I want to say good-bye to her in a proper way.

1531
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:43,130
我向天发誓
And then I will stand up tall when you shoot me.

1532
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,630
之后我会站直让你枪杀我
I swear to god I will.

1533
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,600
等我去了天堂
And when I get to heaven,

1534
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,300
我不会诅咒你的灵魂
I won't damn your souls

1535
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,270
我会向上帝请求不要
and ask god to send you fryin' to hell

1536
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,210
把你送去地狱受惩罚
for what you done to me.

1537
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:58,040
你才是要下地狱的人
You're the one going to hell,

1538
01:38:58,490 --> 01:39:03,450
你没有资格在上帝面前提要求
and you ain't gonna be askin' god for squat.

1539
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,150
罗斯安娜是爱他的
Roseanna does love him.

1540
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,350
我们要是不这么做 她会恨我们一辈子的
She'll hate us forever if we don't allow it.

1541
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,480
不行 我说过了!
No, I said!

1542
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,390
除了一碗汤
He gets a bowl of stew.

1543
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,990
其他的都别想要
Nothing else.

1544
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,660
我不喜欢喝汤
That stew didn't set right with me.

1545
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:20,000
你们介意我回家吗?
Do y'all mind if I go home?

1546
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,200
当然 兄弟
No, sure, bud.

1547
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:24,140
来吧
Come on.

1548
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,290
我们开杀戒的时候 你最好不在场
You shouldn't be here when we do the killin' anyways.

1549
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:28,160
对 你太小了
Yeah, you're too young.

1550
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,510
我不小了
I ain't too young.

1551
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,960
我就是觉得不舒服 好吗?
I just don't feel so good, all right?

1552
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:37,450
拜了 兄弟
Bye, bud.

1553
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,430
该死的 我在阴间等你
Hell, I'll see you on the other side.

1554
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,260
我要跟我妹讲话
I got to talk to my sister.

1555
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:24,860
噢 天啊 兄弟
Oh, my god, bud.

1556
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,760
你这是干什么去了?
What are you doing out in this?

1557
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,420
哈特菲尔德先生!
Mr. Hatfield!

1558
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:38,230
哈特菲尔德先生!
Mr. Hatfield!

1559
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,400
哈特菲尔德先生!
Mr. Hatfield!

1560
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,950
我的兄弟们抓住了约翰斯!
My brothers have got johnse!

1561
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,460
他们准备天亮时分杀了他!
They're plannin' on killin' him at dawn!

1562
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:52,580
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

1563
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:54,990
如果我告诉你 你发誓
If I tell you, you got to swear

1564
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,600
不要伤害我的兄弟们!
you ain't gonna hurt my brothers!

1565
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:00,030
只要我儿子无恙 你的兄弟们肯定没事
If my son is safe, no harm will come to your brothers.

1566
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,550
说 他在哪儿?
Now, where is he?

1567
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,000
他们在我叔叔哈蒙家的老房子
They got him at my uncle harmon's old place.

1568
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,220
走 走 走 快走
Go, go, go, go, go.

1569
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,390
哈特菲尔德先生 拜托你 要快!
Please, Mr. Hatfield, hurry!

1570
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,520
赶快 我去给你拿靴子
Go on. I'll get your boots.

1571
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:10,930
拜托!
Please!

1572
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,980
约翰斯 我们暂时不会了结你小命
Now, johnse, we wouldn't normally kill you,

1573
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:19,780
直到有一位绅士光明正大的迎娶我妹妹
'cept there's an honorable man willing to marry our sister

1574
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:21,150
那时才是你的死期
soon as you're dead.

1575
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:27,260
是谁?
Who's that?

1576
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:31,430
佩里・克莱因律师答应迎娶罗斯安娜
Lawyer Perry Cline has agreed to make roseanna his wife.

1577
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:35,500
杀夫夺子 还要霸占别人的妻子
Having a man killed to marry their woman and take their baby,

1578
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:37,380
这可不是光明正大行为
that ain't honorable.

1579
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:40,050
还剩一小时 哈特菲尔德
One hour to go, Hatfield.
