1
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,884
Hey, Melodie.

2
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,636
- Hey.
- Look, I know

3
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,265
we've known each other
for a really long time.

4
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,728
And we live across the street
from each other and stuff.

5
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,021
And...

6
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,941
I know, like, in four days,

7
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,694
I'm sure, if...

8
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:52,155
- You know, prom's, like, in four days...
- Oh, my God.

9
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,073
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

10
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,706
Fuck,no.

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,666
No, I... No, I just...

12
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,253
- You're probably going with someone.
- I'm sorry.

13
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,088
I don't know how to put this nicely.

14
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,632
There's not a nice way to put it.

15
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,175
You're a fucking nerd.

16
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,053
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

17
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,056
Look at her. Look at her.

18
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,558
- Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.
- I'll see you later.

19
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,894
- Bye.
- All right, buddy, good talk.

20
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,479
Dude, classic.

21
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>Greg Jenko to the principal's office.
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.</i>

22
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,777
- Shit.
- Good luck, bro.

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,987
I said loud and clear,

24
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,407
if you didn't get your grades up,
you weren't going to the prom.

25
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,285
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

26
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,246
I should pay who?

27
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,498
You're not going to the prom.

28
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,834
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

29
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,295
But I'm going to be prom king.

30
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,339
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

31
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,050
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

32
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,406
Fuck! Fuck!

33
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,003
Welcome to the Police Academy.

34
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:33,464
Make sure your form is completely filled out,
then move along.

35
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:39,470
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

36
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,144
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

37
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,937
Oh, fuck!

38
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,109
- You're good at this, huh?
- Yeah, I am.

39
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,193
Thank you.

40
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,947
Such bullshit.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,577
You're really good at this.

42
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,621
Yeah, I am.

43
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,206
Hey, you want to be friends?

44
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,879
Come on. Come on, let's go.

45
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,715
Come on, pick your knees up.
Pick your knees up.

46
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,801
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

47
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,305
Chill, all right?
Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

48
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,187
What did I tell you?
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,189
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

50
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,815
Faster. Let's go.

51
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,321
Clear!

52
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,115
Clear!

53
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,201
Come on, come on, come on! Stop.

54
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,827
Yes! Yes!

55
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,291
Let me see. Let me see.

56
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,544
Nice.

57
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,465
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:01,302
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

59
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:04,639
Get ready for a lifetime
of being bad ass motherfuckers.

60
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,057
I am.

61
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,444
I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,

62
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,655
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

63
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,991
Do you guys really think
this is a police matter?

64
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,242
To get your Frisbee back?

65
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,745
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

66
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,414
Shit.

67
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,542
Shit! Shit!

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,003
Yours isn't loaded, right?

69
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,213
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

70
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,673
What, you... No.

71
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,341
That's no fun. Come on.

72
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,010
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

73
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,261
It's right there.

74
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,388
- Don't you... Don't...
- Don't. Stop it.

75
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,433
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

76
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,309
You feel like a big shot?

77
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,770
No fucking way.

78
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:54,772
One Percenters?

79
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,941
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

80
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:01,029
If we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

81
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,322
You see what I see?

82
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,283
Cannabis sativa.

83
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,535
Chaka Khan.

84
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,747
Chaka Khan?

85
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:29,432
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

86
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,893
Have we forgotten
that the use of marijuana is illegal?

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,520
I have glaucoma.

88
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,980
I get nervous in crowds.

89
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,273
Herpes.

90
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,444
Then you won't mind
if I search your bike, now, would you?

91
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,905
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

92
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,783
<i>- Get up.
- Célmate, gringo.</i>

93
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:51,412
Man, you guys even real cops?
You look like the kids on Halloween.

94
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:56,042
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

95
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,503
I know, right? I know.

96
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,379
It's hilarious.

97
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:01,923
So why don't you show us a little respect?

98
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,466
- Fuck you, pig-
- Hey.

99
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,176
You want me to beat your dick off?

100
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,303
You want to beat my dick off?

101
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,222
I'll beat your dick off with both hands.
What's up? Let's go.

102
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,265
- That's weird, man.
- I think what he was trying to say was,

103
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,935
he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area

104
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,145
that your dick's just going to fall off.

105
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,563
Why do you have salt in your...

106
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,565
- That's actual drugs.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,275
Get on the ground! Hey!

108
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,985
- Come here now!
- What do I do?

109
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,821
- Chase someone!
- Chase someone?

110
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,698
Are you leaving your bike here?

111
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,283
Okay. All right.

112
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,995
Don't run from me!
You're making it worse for yourself!

113
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,413
No! Get out of the way!

114
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,748
Stop!

115
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,044
I'm going to shoot you
if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

116
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,589
Hey! Come here!

117
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,175
I'm not playing any more! I'm so not kidding!

118
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,136
I got him. I got him.

119
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,434
Freeze! Freeze!

120
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,646
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

121
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,356
That's it! Come here!

122
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,864
Freeze! Stop it!

123
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,243
You're a pussy!

124
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,124
You got the right to... Give me that!
You got the right to...

125
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,543
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

126
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,253
My elbow.

127
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,297
- You got nothing.
- How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

128
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,257
- Hey! Hey!
- How's it feel? How's it feel now?

129
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,968
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

130
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,469
We got one! I got him!

131
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,222
Yes! Yes!

132
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,891
- Yeah!
- We got an arrest!

133
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,310
- Yeah! We got him!
- Yes!

134
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,897
- Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
- Fuck you! Yeah!

135
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,023
What's up?

136
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:48,487
Drop my nuts
on your motherfucking forehead!

137
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,823
- That's right.
- Fuck you, park!

138
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,700
- We arrest people now!
- What up, park?

139
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,411
- What's up? What's up?
- What up, park? Who wants one?

140
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,503
Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

141
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,297
- Thank you, Cinnamon.
- Are those new?

142
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,883
The department was forced
to drop the charges

143
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,677
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda rights.

144
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,057
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

145
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,309
you have to do when arresting someone?

146
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,313
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

147
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,524
- Do you even know the Miranda rights?
- Yes.

148
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,485
Let's hear them, then.

149
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,612
You got a lot of stuff to do.

150
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,656
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

151
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,823
We got time.

152
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,409
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

153
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,746
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,

154
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,414
for a total of 57 words.

155
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:44,752
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with,
"You have the right to remain silent."

156
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,838
I know you've heard this before. And then,

157
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,425
I think it sounds something like...

158
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,804
-"You have the right to an attorney."
- Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

159
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,473
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

160
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,601
Did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?

161
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:04,313
You do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.

162
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,523
Where were you?

163
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,110
I was chasing my perp, sir.

164
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,028
And how did that go for you?

165
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,698
Honestly, he did get away,

166
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,616
and he threw me down pretty hard.

167
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,868
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

168
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,078
Can I see that?

169
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,623
Yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

170
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,167
Wow.

171
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,836
Fortunately for you two,

172
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,673
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s

173
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,425
and revamping it for modern times.

174
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,801
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

175
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,096
lack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,

176
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,975
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

177
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,893
and expect us all not to notice.

178
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,189
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

179
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,983
immature-seeming officers.

180
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,653
Sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,

181
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,614
a child sex slavery ring or something?

182
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:59,285
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

183
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,122
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

184
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,291
I think you idiots are perfect.

185
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,834
You're officially transferred.

186
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,461
- All right. Yeah.
- That's great.

187
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,254
Where should we report to?

188
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,964
Down on Jump Street.

189
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,924
37 Jump Street.

190
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,136
No, that doesn't sound right.

191
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,429
Is it...

192
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,225
This has got to be a joke.

193
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,144
This is it.

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,487
Aroma of Christ Church?

195
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,506
How's it going?

196
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,719
This place is weird.

197
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,564
Everybody comfortable?

198
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,316
Yeah.

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,197
Get your motherfucking ass up
when I'm talking!

200
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,493
You will be going undercover
as high school students.

201
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,580
You are here simply because you look young.

202
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,666
You some Justin Beaver,

203
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,585
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

204
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,129
Captain Sassy.

205
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,880
I know what you're thinking,

206
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,591
"Angry Black Captain."

207
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,261
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

208
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,721
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

209
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,056
I'm black.

210
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,226
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

211
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,897
And sometimes I get angry.

212
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,524
So suck a dick!

213
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,776
What I'm trying to show you is,

214
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,945
embrace your stereotypes.

215
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:02,032
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

216
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,701
And he's probably a dummy.

217
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,953
And then this guy.

218
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,081
He's short and insecure.

219
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,708
And he's probably good with money.

220
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,127
- You are good with money.
- What the fuck?

221
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,629
Didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?

222
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,256
I don't... I actually didn't...

223
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,549
I didn't get a letter or anything.

224
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,343
- Yeah, like, a start time...
- With a dress code or anything like that.

225
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,220
Teenage the fuck up!

226
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,601
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

227
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,352
Do not get expelled.

228
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,481
Nobody in the system knows you're here.
All right? Nobody.

229
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,149
You get kicked out of school,

230
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,903
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of Jump Street.

231
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,738
Rule number two. Burns.

232
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,409
Do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.

233
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,120
You hear that? That's you.

234
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,914
- Don't do it, man.
- Why...

235
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,625
- Keep that dirty dick in your pants.
- Dirty?

236
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,418
Don't fuck no students.

237
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,086
Don't fuck no teachers.

238
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,632
Sir, I know we come off
as a couple of lady-killers,

239
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,885
but I promise you
we will be super professional on the job.

240
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,429
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties

241
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,765
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

242
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,184
I was talking to your partner over here.

243
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,228
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

244
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,271
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

245
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,523
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

246
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,066
- I'm talking to you.
- Cool.

247
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,694
Now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.

248
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:21,946
Right now!

249
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,615
<i>Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.</i>

250
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>So I bought these,</i>

251
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,620
<i>which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right now.</i>

252
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,288
<i>Cheers.</i>

253
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,666
It's a new synthetic drug.

254
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,919
Goes by the street name H.F.S.

255
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,963
<i>Holy fucking shit.</i>

256
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,631
<i>Holy...</i>

257
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,800
They put this on the Internet
for everybody to see?

258
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,553
They're teenagers, man.
They're really stupid.

259
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,471
So you should blend right in.

260
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,824
<i>Jessica, will you go to prom with me?
But I already know the answer. It's yes.</i>

261
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,715
I could watch this kid all day.

262
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,383
Man, this kid rules.

263
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,843
Ruled.

264
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,179
His parents found him OD'd
in his room a few days ago.

265
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,556
He's dead.

266
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,185
Whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.

267
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,355
And as you can see, this kid is white.

268
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,191
That means people actually give a shit.

269
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:45,237
Sir, I just want to throw out to you
that I would give a shit if he was black.

270
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,077
Right now, H.F.S.
Is contained right there at Sagan High.

271
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:56,457
Now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.

272
00:15:56,624 --> 00:16:00,252
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

273
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,297
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

274
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,424
like photography and drama.

275
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,926
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

276
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,762
Find out who's slinging this shit.

277
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,097
Schmidt, says you were a virgin

278
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,724
-through high school.
- It says that?

279
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,559
No. I just assumed it,

280
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:20,939
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.

281
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,360
It's the Juggling Society,
but it's fine. it's fine.

282
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,820
They're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.

283
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,031
That's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.

284
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,659
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

285
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,703
Here's your new identities, all right?

286
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,622
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

287
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,499
The mission is this.

288
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,001
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

289
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,920
We get to be brothers?

290
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,090
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

291
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,801
But if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.

292
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,637
God damn.
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

293
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,697
Hey, Korean Jesus.

294
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:14,451
I don't know if you only cater
to Korean Christians

295
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,706
or if you even exist. No offense.

296
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,210
I just...

297
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,006
I'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.

298
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,471
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

299
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:40,477
I know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe I'm not the best cop.

300
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,148
Korean Jesus,
I just really don't want to fuck this up.

301
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,817
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

302
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,486
The end?

303
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,948
I don't really know how to end a prayer.
The end?

304
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,199
Yeah.

305
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:00,873
Hey! Hey!

306
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,333
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

307
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,836
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

308
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,463
With Korean shit.

309
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,048
- You two get to your mama house ASAP.
- What?

310
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,801
You're teenagers now, all right?

311
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:15,095
You two are staying
at Schmidt's parents' house

312
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,889
for the duration of this assignment.

313
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,348
Fuck me.

314
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,059
This house is adorable.

315
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,771
My baby's home! Come here.

316
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,481
You will always be
my infant angel baby child.

317
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,274
There's my guy-

318
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,942
It's great to see you guys.

319
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,404
- Hey.
- Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

320
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,615
Oh, my God.
Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

321
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,825
- This is unbelievable.
- Well, yeah.

322
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,119
- I guess I did.
- It's gorgeous!

323
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,704
So are you.

324
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,249
Honey, listen, I want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room

325
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,542
'cause we're kind of using that
as a workout area,

326
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,294
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

327
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,088
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please.
No, no.

328
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,049
Don't touch that.
We just brought it back from Sedona.

329
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,635
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

330
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,178
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

331
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,472
-and you guys haven't moved on.
- Rid of it?

332
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,099
If we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.

333
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,435
I look like Fred Savage
from The Wonder Years,

334
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,396
but completely naked,
wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

335
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,482
That is a great picture, Morton.

336
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,900
You look like a young Jay Leno.

337
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,611
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

338
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:14,988
No.

339
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,782
I remember. You know why?

340
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,660
Because I've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.

341
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:24,081
I mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.

342
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,707
It's literally a medal for sucking.

343
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,709
- No, that is a medal for trying.
- Yes.

344
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,672
Let me tell you something.
This guy was always a great tryer.

345
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,883
That must be Phyllis.
She is just dying to see you.

346
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,011
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here?
She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

347
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,098
I told you, it's an undercover assignment.
It's super secretive.

348
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,475
"Undercover." That's so cute.

349
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,229
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, honey. I want you to know

350
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,730
-we are so glad you're here.
- Okay.

351
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,774
That's great. Thank you.

352
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,110
- All right. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

353
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,988
He just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.

354
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,365
- Bye-bye.
- I baked muffins!

355
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,826
If you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.

356
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,202
You got to study this stuff.

357
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,163
Forget those identities. They're bullshit.
They said I was held back a year.

358
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,957
You were. You were held back two years.

359
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,127
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

360
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,462
Fuck! Socks don't match.

361
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,964
I got to start all over.

362
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,133
It's the first day of school, dude.
I got to look awesome.

363
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,969
You know, back in the day,
you were super popular,

364
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,763
and I wasn't as much

365
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,350
We didn't really get along in high school.

366
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,478
You don't think that's going to happen again,
do you?

367
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,524
No. Come on, man. We're adults now.
We're best buds.

368
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,984
It's definitely not going to happen again.

369
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,652
- We're good.
- Cool.

370
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,661
Beautiful day out there, boys.

371
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,872
Just shut up.

372
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,709
"Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

373
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,002
"You have the right to an attorney.

374
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,130
"If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."

375
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,592
Dude, do you still not know
the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

376
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,679
Come on, man. They always cutaway on TV
before they finish them.

377
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,059
All right, let's do it.

378
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,936
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

379
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,020
What are you doing?

380
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,022
- What? What are you talking about?
- Are you two-strapping?

381
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,734
- My backpack? Yeah.
- Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

382
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,611
You got to one-strap it.

383
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,280
Seriously, I would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.

384
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,740
Okay, what makes you the expert?

385
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,159
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

386
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,203
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

387
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:31,792
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School,
by Jenko.

388
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,253
One, don't try hard at anything.

389
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,632
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

390
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,634
Three, be handsome.

391
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,970
Four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,

392
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,097
you punch them directly in the face.

393
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,557
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

394
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,893
Shit.

395
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,358
All right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,

396
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,277
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

397
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,904
We would never.

398
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,240
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

399
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,744
- Hey, you ready?
- Go! '

400
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,254
That was awesome! That was amazing.

401
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,423
- Was I flying?
- That was amazing.

402
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,799
All right, do mine, do mine.

403
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,427
- Okay, ready? Here I go.
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,101
You Okay?

405
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,937
I think I shit my pants.

406
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,612
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

407
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,490
- It'll make us look cool.
- That's awesome.

408
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:01,965
Dude?

409
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,926
- Everybody's two-strapping it.
- Just stay with the one-strap.

410
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,887
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

411
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,556
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

412
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,224
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to use two straps.

413
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,894
- One strap is peer pressure.
- No. No. You're fucking up right now.

414
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,937
Okay, those are Goths.

415
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,982
Those are nerds.

416
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,444
I don't know what they are.

417
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,698
What the fuck are those things?

418
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,158
I'm so confused right now.

419
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,833
Whoa.

420
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,129
- Hi.
- Hey.

421
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,964
- Hey.
- Good morning.

422
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,426
Hey, yo. Hey.

423
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,554
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

424
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,223
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

425
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,058
No, try, like, seven.

426
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,061
- What about you?
- Biodiesel, dawg.

427
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,521
Smells like egg rolls.

428
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,399
Yeah, it does.
Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

429
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,694
But we try to ride bikes when we can.
Global crisis and whatnot.

430
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,656
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

431
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,450
You don't care about the environment?
That's kind of fucked up, man.

432
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,119
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

433
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,912
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

434
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,582
Look at him. He's trying.

435
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,501
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

436
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,461
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

437
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,797
- Look at him. Look at the nerd.
- Who you calling a nerd, man?

438
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,215
I'm sorry. What...

439
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,968
- Shit!
- Shit, dude.

440
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,137
Are you okay, man? Hey, what the hell?
Are you serious?

441
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,888
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

442
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,849
- You punched me because I'm gay?
- What?

443
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,643
No. Come on.

444
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:37,894
That's not cool, man.

445
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,187
That is really insensitive.

446
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,605
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

447
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,818
I punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.

448
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,945
- I was gay when you punched me!
- In a weird way,

449
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,364
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you

450
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,283
-just because you were gay.
- Right.

451
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,368
You punched a little gay
black kid in the face,

452
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,787
and it's not even second period.
How do you explain that?

453
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,582
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

454
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,208
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

455
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,044
A kid died the other day from drugs,

456
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,464
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.

457
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,967
That's weird, guys.

458
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,053
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

459
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,347
causing trouble in my school.

460
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,267
I am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face

461
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,770
away from a nervous breakdown.
Do I make myself clear?

462
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,105
You guys cross my line again,

463
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:26,693
and you walk into this office,
I'm going to expel you. You got me?

464
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,113
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

465
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,617
Let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.

466
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,119
Which one of you is named Doug?

467
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,288
- No, dude, I'm Brad.
- Okay, good.

468
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,582
So that means your name is Doug, son.

469
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,167
- Yeah, I'm Doug.
- Great.

470
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,585
Here are your class schedules.

471
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,296
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.

472
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,090
I wouldn't.
But you as a drama geek, far less surprising.

473
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,550
Thank you.

474
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,260
Now we have the wrong identities,
you dumb-ass.

475
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,472
I'm in drama. I suck at drama.
It's girly and embarrassing.

476
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,974
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

477
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,353
I can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.

478
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,731
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry.
And, no, you can't,

479
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,733
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!

480
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,445
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes,
and I'm going to go to yours.

481
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,614
Okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?

482
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,032
Fuck.

483
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,787
So, we are going to hold auditions
for the Peter Pan part today.

484
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:23,166
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

485
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,295
When I was a young actor just starting out
in New York state,

486
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,797
Albany, to be exact,

487
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,091
- I booked a local television commercial...
- Hey.

488
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,176
...In which I had to play a young man...

489
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,179
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

490
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,267
So are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?

491
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,895
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

492
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,357
I was just busting your balls.

493
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,361
Okay. Good.

494
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,616
I remember, one time,
doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

495
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,370
and we were having so much fun.

496
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,665
And then I realized that she was dead.

497
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,793
I remember one summer...

498
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,878
Do kids still do this stuff?

499
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,755
Even after what happened to him?

500
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,342
Everyone's saying
that Billiam had a heart murmur.

501
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,512
Pretty much everyone I know does it,
but it's not my thing.

502
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,889
It's not really my thing, either,

503
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,767
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

504
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,770
Who would he call if he wanted it?

505
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,981
Well, you can tell your friend

506
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,400
that if he really wanted it,

507
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,485
it's not so hard to find.

508
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,988
When to take it.
He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

509
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,906
Drugs are bad.

510
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:41,161
But they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.

511
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,204
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

512
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,248
Notice the distinction.
I said "professional actor."

513
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,756
New person. Mr. Texty Texty.

514
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,717
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

515
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,261
let's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

516
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,222
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

517
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,810
I can't.
I'm fine just being a tree or something.

518
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,021
Doug, you never won't know

519
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,608
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.

520
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,817
My point is,

521
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,695
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

522
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,615
Yeah, sure.

523
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,742
My favorite molecule is water.

524
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,119
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter.

525
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,749
Its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.

526
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:32,128
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.

527
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,047
H2O.

528
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,800
H2O. H2O.

529
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,135
- H20
- It's okay. Thank you.

530
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,972
Thank you, Zack. So good.

531
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,850
All right, anybody else
for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

532
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,561
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

533
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:49,938
A What?

534
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,856
I'm sorry.

535
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,441
What is your name? Brad?

536
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,402
- Brad. Yes, ma'am.
- Wow. Look at you,

537
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,112
Brad. Big.

538
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,698
What is a pop Quiznos?

539
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:07,163
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

540
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,333
- Today's quiz is on...
- You look really old.

541
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,504
- Were you held back or something or...
- No. You look super young.

542
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,464
Were you held forward?

543
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,634
I went to school in France, so

544
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:23,179
And they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. It's so lame.

545
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:26,099
French, the language of love.

546
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,810
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

547
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,854
Hey.

548
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,357
Good luck.

549
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,332
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

550
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,627
<i>I'm just the cleverest.</i> ..

551
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,087
Okay.

552
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,592
Maybe try one cooler.

553
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,969
And faster.

554
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,556
And louder. And better.

555
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,393
And less insecure and more just cool

556
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,984
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

557
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,235
I'm going to run outside,

558
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,113
and I'm going to utilize those,
and I'm going to come back.

559
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,417
It's such bullshit.

560
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,968
Wow. You're fast.

561
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,804
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

562
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,182
Let me check out your chest.

563
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:50,975
Check out your test... Let me...

564
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,602
Let me grade your quiz.

565
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,983
Can I go take a dump?

566
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,362
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

567
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:06,157
We have this "hurry back" rule,

568
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,285
so if you're not back in six minutes,
I have to send you to the principal.

569
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,788
Rules are rules, so,

570
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,041
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

571
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,876
- Which way is yearbook?
- I don't know.

572
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,002
- Is it this way?
- I don't know!

573
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,062
- Yo.
- Hey.

574
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,146
You guys, huh?

575
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,609
That was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.

576
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,819
- Yeah.
- He feels awful. He feels...

577
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,737
Totally, very nervous.

578
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,115
You're the dealer?

579
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,241
- You're the dealer guy?
- Is that you?

580
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:49,951
Yep.

581
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,160
So do you make the stuff or...

582
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,997
Do I look like a fucking scientist?
No, I just sell it.

583
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,624
- Yeah, he just sells it. Come on
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

584
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,668
- I meant I just...
- How many you guys want?

585
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,420
20 bucks a pop.

586
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,382
One each? One pop each of drugs.

587
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,009
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

588
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,302
Whoa!

589
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,221
- Dude, come on.
- No! Maybe you're a narc.

590
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,181
You know who calls people narcs?

591
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,850
Narcs, narc.

592
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,145
First of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,

593
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,938
because if you call us narcs,

594
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,775
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

595
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,694
-'Cause you just said that.
- They call people...

596
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,071
Look, I don't have time for this shit.
You guys want to do this or not?

597
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,239
- Jesus.
- Yes.

598
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,199
- Yes, yes.
- No problem.

599
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,828
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

600
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,996
I'm sorry. What?

601
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,124
- We were going to take it home.
- I gotta go back to class,

602
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,585
-is the only thing.
- I was thinking that I was going to go home,

603
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,170
maybe turn down the lights,

604
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,630
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

605
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,465
I was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.

606
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,384
Okay, I'm not asking.
Take it now or get the fuck out.

607
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,428
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.

608
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,598
Yeah?

609
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,727
Yeah, no, it's all good.

610
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,481
- I love doing drugs at school.
- I'll just take the drugs right here,

611
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,149
in our mouths.

612
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,901
There you go. That's it.

613
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,534
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

614
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,994
Have fun.

615
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,789
- You got to pull the trigger!
- Okay.

616
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,499
You got to pull the trigger!

617
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,376
- We got to throw up, man.
- I can't.

618
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,503
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died.
We got to throw up.

619
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,296
Just think of something gross.
Think of something gross.

620
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,007
- You fucking think of something.
- Okay, all right, all right.

621
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,551
Your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.

622
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,512
- What the fuck are you saying?
- I don't know! I'm just trying!

623
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,305
- I'm trying my best! I'm just trying!
- Fuck! Come on, man!

624
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,265
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths

625
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:37,934
- No!
- Yeah.

626
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,143
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

627
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,938
- Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die?
- Okay, fine!

628
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,732
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

629
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,075
What are you doing?
Are you trying to find my G-spot?

630
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,160
- Just stick it in!
- I don't know. I've never done this before!

631
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,370
Just stick it in! Go!

632
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,419
Cut your fucking fingernails!

633
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,630
Oh, God!

634
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,758
Is it me?

635
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,176
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,344
I just can't sometimes.

637
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,180
Think we're going to be fine.
I don't feel anything.

638
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,682
Me, neither.

639
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,350
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

640
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,770
You got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

641
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,564
Pass, in your hand.

642
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,815
Hello.

643
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,568
Damn. You guys are late.

644
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,403
Now I'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.

645
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:34,615
- No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry.
- Come on, please.

646
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,701
You have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.

647
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,287
When'd you go through puberty?
Like, at seven or something?

648
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,581
You look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.

649
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,500
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

650
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,626
I read your file.

651
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,838
You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

652
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,090
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

653
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:53,009
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?

654
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,260
I consider that a threat.

655
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,095
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

656
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,015
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

657
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:00,850
That's Brad.

658
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,436
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

659
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,313
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

660
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:10,693
the track star, and this is Brad,
the science prodigy.

661
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,323
He's really fast.

662
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,036
Is this funny to you guys?

663
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,254
So you're Doug. You're Doug. You're Doug.

664
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:31,547
You're Doug. You're Doug.

665
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,216
Here's the deal.

666
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:36,135
My track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.

667
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,263
I mean, if I wasn't the coach,
I'd be laughing my ass off

668
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,725
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

669
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,769
so I need you.

670
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,146
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

671
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,356
Understand?

672
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:52,568
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400
at today's track meet.

673
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,238
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

674
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,365
Don't blow on me, son.

675
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,201
I haven't trained.

676
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,913
Guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.

677
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,082
Do we have a deal?

678
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,876
Yes.

679
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,087
Nice.

680
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:16,717
I don't like that.
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

681
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,427
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it.

682
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,222
What are you doing? Stop it.

683
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,599
Actually, that's not bad.

684
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,601
All right, here you go.

685
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,480
Are you guys on drugs?

686
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,237
Okay.

687
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,990
One particle of Unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

688
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,618
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner
into a radioactive spider.

689
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,455
Fuck you, science!

690
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,714
All right, all right, we're good.

691
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,716
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

692
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:58,467
We're good, baby.

693
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:00,970
Good work. Hit that shit.

694
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,731
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

695
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,317
<i>I'm just the cleverest fellow</i>

696
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,029
<i>'Twas ever my fortune to know</i>

697
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,115
<i>I taught a trick to my shadow</i>

698
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,243
<i>To stick to the tip of my toe</i>

699
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,372
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

700
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:33,210
<i>I've gotta</i>

701
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:38,507
<i>Crow!</i>

702
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,177
Christoph, did you feel that?

703
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,678
Who are you?

704
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,559
Welcome aboard, Peter.

705
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,696
No, keep it going!

706
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,907
Keep it going. That was so tight!

707
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,241
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

708
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,998
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

709
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,792
All right! Yeah!

710
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,211
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

711
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,839
I know y'all seen this shit before.

712
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,341
I know you've seen this shit before.

713
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:23,094
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

714
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:25,054
You're looking amped!

715
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:28,391
Here we go.

716
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,809
Here we go! Here we go!

717
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,061
Hey, pick it up!

718
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,231
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up.
What are you doing?

719
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,359
What are you doing? Pick it...

720
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,611
What? McQuaid!

721
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,115
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

722
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,992
Come on!

723
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,743
McQuaid!

724
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,954
Run that way!

725
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,165
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

726
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,129
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

727
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,505
Let's go! Come on!

728
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,173
Oh, my God.

729
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,384
No, no.

730
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,261
No, stop.

731
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:06,846
Come here. Come here.

732
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,347
Don't make a...

733
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:09,932
That is a baton penis.

734
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,527
Speak of the devil!

735
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,280
Dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

736
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,615
Organized sports are so fascist.
It makes me sick.

737
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:28,576
That's just what I do.

738
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,619
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

739
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,958
I don't get this school.

740
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,461
That was awesome.

741
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,131
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

742
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,591
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

743
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:45,468
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

744
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,595
Okay, Captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,

745
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,888
but they're not normal popular.

746
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,432
They're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone

747
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:52,850
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

748
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,019
It's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.

749
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,813
Lead dealer, Eric Molson. Alpha dog.

750
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,982
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

751
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,275
Did the AIDS run this year.

752
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,903
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

753
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,362
and he totally gets me.

754
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,740
Who put this together? Are you autistic?

755
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,700
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

756
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,119
-the yarn actually indicates...
- We're compiling a list

757
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,246
of suspicious types at school.
The users are here.

758
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,624
This kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.

759
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,792
Cut the bullshit!

760
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,461
I want to know who's the supplier.

761
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,464
We don't know. That's why
there's a question mark on his face.

762
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,716
That's not the way his face looks.
That's just a question mark.

763
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,427
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

764
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,720
Simple.

765
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,015
Sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.

766
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,558
Great job. You guys are on fire

767
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,977
- So proud.
- Like you could do any better?

768
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,938
We just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs

769
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,357
stripping down cars
in the Garfield High metal shop.

770
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,568
- What?
- Meanwhile, you two were standing around

771
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,529
finger-popping each other's assholes

772
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:49,198
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

773
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,784
What we're doing is getting shit done.

774
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,285
<i>Yeah, as a matter of fact,</i>

775
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,995
<i>I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech</i>

776
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,415
<i>drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.</i>

777
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,133
- Password!
- Open the door!

778
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,176
- You have to say the password.
- I'm sorry. What?

779
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,636
What are you...

780
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,389
Geez.

781
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:19,228
What are y'all doing?
How'd you get a key in here?

782
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,565
Ms. Griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

783
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,984
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

784
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:26,652
- Let me see. You dealing drugs?
- No.

785
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,571
It's just a card game.
It's, like, a hybrid card game.

786
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,489
- See? They open up.
- Battle Brawlers.

787
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,408
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No.

788
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:36,036
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm here to study.

789
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,622
Good. You could use it.
You're pretty far behind, so...

790
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,791
You're behind. I'm ahead.

791
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,085
- I know everything.
- Really?

792
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,920
What's a covalent bond?

793
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,006
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

794
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,550
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry.

795
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,344
I just... I don't think you know everything.

796
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,721
I know everything.

797
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:55,472
Okay.

798
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,275
What kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?

799
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:10,696
They say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.

800
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,364
It helps them to stick together.

801
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,659
I could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.

802
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,746
What are you doing
with all those phones anyway?

803
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,874
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.

804
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,710
You know, I switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

805
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,003
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

806
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:29,965
No, no, I can't install a spyware
to remotely monitor calls

807
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,425
or anything that the mic picks up.

808
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,928
- I can't do that at all.
- Wait, you can't do it?

809
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,554
No, I can't.

810
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,724
- Is he being sarcastic?
- I don't know.

811
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,101
So you can.

812
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,274
Liking comic books is popular.

813
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,110
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

814
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,364
If I was just born 10 years later,
I would have been the coolest person ever.

815
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,366
I know. It's bullshit.

816
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:57,910
You know what?

817
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,329
I totally know the cause.

818
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,831
<i>Glee. Fuck you, Glee.</i>

819
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,834
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

820
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:10,047
I might become popular.
I might get in with the popular kids.

821
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:14,385
We just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

822
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,636
You saying we should throw a party?

823
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,597
I'll invite Molly,
and then Molly will invite Eric,

824
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,724
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.

825
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:23,185
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?

826
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,645
I think it would be better if you get in

827
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,272
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.

828
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:27,856
That'd be the best thing for the case.

829
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,985
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

830
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,538
- Hello?
- Hey. Is this Molly?

831
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,123
Speaking.

832
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:45,666
Hey. It's Schmidt.

833
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:49,545
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

834
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,922
Hey, man.

835
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,966
It's so weird that you're calling me.

836
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,178
I pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.

837
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:02,057
I was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,

838
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,225
-and. . .
- Hello?

839
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,518
Mom, get off the phone!

840
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,645
<i>Sorry, DOUG,</i>

841
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,397
<i>-my teen son.
- Mom!</i>

842
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,858
<i>I love you, honey, Dougie
Doug, Douglas McQuaid.</i>

843
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,776
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

844
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,450
<i>I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.</i>

845
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:23,620
She just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

846
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,957
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

847
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,461
<i>Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.</i>

848
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:33,797
There was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

849
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,675
<i>The doctor thought
I was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.</i>

850
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,719
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

851
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:40,596
Yeah, because you already had one.

852
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:42,181
Exactly. I already had one.

853
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,016
And you don't need two vaginae.
You just don't.

854
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,101
<i>Although you could use one as a coin purse.</i>

855
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:48,687
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

856
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:51,023
Wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

857
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,941
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.

858
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,403
I'm just fucking with you.

859
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,489
That is a weird joke.

860
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,199
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

861
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:01,867
No, he did walk out on us, though.

862
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:04,870
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

863
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,038
Just broken dreams.

864
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,458
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say,

865
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,626
well,

866
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,129
that there are some good guys out there,

867
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:17,800
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

868
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,219
taint your memory.

869
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:21,804
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

870
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,723
Are you getting choked up?
I'm sorry if I made you upset.

871
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:28,644
<i>No, it's just, you know,
I don't like when guys are mean to girls.</i>

872
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,063
Yeah. Well, thanks.

873
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:33,565
Normal transition here.

874
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:37,903
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come!

875
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,822
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

876
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,075
Do you mind if I just put, like,
a posting on Facebook?

877
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,160
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

878
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:46,870
<i>I should call you back.</i>

879
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,206
Well, all right, I'll see you at school.
You're a great person.

880
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,249
'5Ye-bye. Bye,
- Bye.

881
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,875
<i>What the fuck are you...</i>

882
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,054
Are y'all throwing a party?

883
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,976
- What?
- There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

884
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:11,603
And if any of my officers

885
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:14,773
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

886
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,151
they'll find theyself in prison

887
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:21,572
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

888
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,867
and me shitting down that snorkel.

889
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,704
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

890
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,748
You're the best. You are the best.

891
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:33,459
- Oh, my God.
- We love you.

892
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,626
- Enjoy the vineyard.
- You boys be good, now.

893
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,004
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

894
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:38,464
Bye!

895
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:41,049
"We love you"? What are you doing?
Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

896
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,468
- I'm in character. Shut up.
- It's weird.

897
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,722
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

898
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,974
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

899
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,310
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

900
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:00,986
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

901
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,155
Oh, no.

902
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:10,954
We got a pound of coke.

903
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,415
We're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.

904
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:14,583
Pound of marijuana?

905
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,668
- Best party ever.
- Boo-yah!

906
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:34,478
To a brilliant idea

907
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,438
from my brilliant brother

908
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,565
that I love so very much.

909
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:41,276
And this is going to fucking rock.

910
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,195
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

911
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,703
- Who invited you guys?
- I did!

912
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:52,788
The party's here!

913
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,040
- What's up, Zack?
- Hey, buddy.

914
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,166
What's up, Roman?

915
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,628
This is crazy. This is, like,
the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

916
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,384
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

917
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,010
Do we have enough chips?

918
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:09,012
Is this playlist too dance-y?

919
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:10,222
- Feels too dance-y.
- Too dance-y?

920
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:13,725
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

921
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,648
What are you doing?

922
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,858
- That's my mom's Kokopelli vase.
- I got it, I got it.

923
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,402
Doug, Doug, hey!

924
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:26,655
<i>Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.</i>

925
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:28,865
Such a bad joke.

926
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,075
Terrible, terrible.

927
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,326
- You guys know each other, right?
- Yeah.

928
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,246
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric.
Wait for the signal.

929
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,248
And then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.

930
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,457
What?

931
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,418
What's up, man, how you doing?

932
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,295
Eco Suave.

933
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:42,838
Whoa.

934
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:46,091
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

935
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,343
Very Native American.

936
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,220
Yeah, our parents are actually

937
00:48:50,304 --> 00:48:52,764
-really into Native American...
- Let's rock and roll.

938
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,059
- Sorry.
- What are y'all doing?

939
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,228
- Come on.
- Did you guys even see Eric?

940
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,355
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

941
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,608
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

942
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,444
Yo, this is butt.
There's, like, no hot dudes here.

943
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,279
- Man, let's bounce.
- We're out of here, man.

944
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:10,198
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here
you just got here.

945
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:12,451
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

946
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,911
Okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,

947
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,538
just go as fast as you possibly can.

948
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:20,250
Taking out the SIM card.

949
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,294
<i>Taking down Eric
with the SIM card information</i>

950
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,129
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

951
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,839
- Are you drunk?
- No.

952
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:27,299
Have you even been drunk before?

953
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,925
- No, but...
- Give me this.

954
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,636
- What?
- Can we get some bitches up in here?

955
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,512
'Cause it's just boys right now.

956
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,306
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

957
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:36,099
This is my parents' bedroom.

958
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,519
- What the fuck, bro? Some privacy!
- Shit, shit, shit!

959
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:42,022
And that is a really gross three-way.

960
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,108
But what was the girl in the back doing?

961
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,194
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

962
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:49,029
Cool, yeah.

963
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:51,114
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

964
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:53,283
but we got to get going.
You know how it is, yeah?

965
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:54,993
Dude, tell me about it.

966
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,621
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

967
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:59,164
It's extracting right now.

968
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,166
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

969
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,001
Read this.
"Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

970
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:05,253
Shit! It's a bust.

971
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,634
- Keep it casual.
- Yeah.

972
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:11,718
- Go with the flow, dude.
- Cool, man.

973
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:13,178
- I don't like to make plans or whatever.
- You got it.

974
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,346
- Thank you again, though, man.
- All right.

975
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,849
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

976
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,018
Hey, why you here, Scott?

977
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:22,521
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

978
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,606
No, I heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.

979
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,192
Wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.

980
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,194
Got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...

981
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,362
I wasn't asking.

982
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

983
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:36,034
Take five, take five, man, let me get this.
I got this.

984
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:38,453
- Yeah? You sure?
- I got this one.

985
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:41,373
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

986
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,375
- Don't worry about who I am.
- I'm worried about it.

987
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,460
- Why?
-'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

988
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,963
This is my temple,
this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

989
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,882
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,

990
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:53,468
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,

991
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:57,639
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott,
what, what, what, what, Scott?"

992
00:50:57,723 --> 00:50:59,099
- It's that kind of party?
- Yeah, dude.

993
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,143
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

994
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,228
- No, it's getting real.
- It's getting very real.

995
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,106
Yeah. It's like seven strangers
living in one house. True story.

996
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,566
- You want <i>Real</i> World?
- Yeah, let's do it, man.

997
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,234
<i>- Come on. What's your Real...
- Here's Real World.</i>

998
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,236
What was that? Did you hear that?

999
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,779
Real enough for you?

1000
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,322
Schmidt. Doug.

1001
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:15,991
- What do I do?
- Hit him!

1002
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,536
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

1003
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,461
Fight normal.

1004
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:28,962
Yo, I'm serious.

1005
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:30,172
Sorry.

1006
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,887
- I'll fucking kill you!
- I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

1007
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:41,266
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

1008
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,061
I kicked him in the nuts.

1009
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,861
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

1010
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:58,450
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

1011
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,410
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- You'll knock over my mom's vase!

1012
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,537
- Fuck your mom's vase!
- Fuck this!

1013
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:08,877
Oh, shit!

1014
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:10,921
Yeah!

1015
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:16,843
That's my brother!

1016
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,267
- That was insane!
- You're so cool!

1017
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,230
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

1018
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,735
Oh, shit,

1019
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:35,737
when did I get stabbed?

1020
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,448
That's awesome.

1021
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,576
Yeah!

1022
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,581
Is that a cop?

1023
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:47,916
Where?

1024
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,252
No, it's not. Here.

1025
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:53,004
I'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.

1026
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,923
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

1027
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,424
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

1028
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:58,593
It's like we're living with a narc.

1029
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:00,637
The boy is an angel.

1030
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,305
Pull it out!

1031
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,351
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

1032
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:07,561
Sorry!

1033
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,822
Okay, let's take some shots.

1034
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,282
Shots, shots!

1035
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,747
That's like us fucking Mother Earth
without a condom.

1036
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,202
What the fuck is going on?

1037
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,163
Annie, hang on.

1038
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,876
Are you fucking kidding me?

1039
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:15,921
Get out of my house. I said get out!
The party's over!

1040
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:17,464
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry!

1041
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:19,341
The mom is coming!

1042
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,509
- Listen to me!
- Chill out! Chill out!

1043
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,303
- Let go of me!
- You're embarrassing me

1044
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,347
-in front of my friends!
- Get back here, you shit!

1045
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:30,477
Dude, that was so crazy, man.

1046
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,771
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

1047
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,481
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

1048
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:36,232
-like, all the time, man.
- I bet you are.

1049
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:38,777
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

1050
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,821
You, dude, I like you, man.

1051
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:43,490
How do you feel about making
a little extra money?

1052
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:45,659
Whatever it is, I'm in.

1053
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:46,993
All right, here's the deal.

1054
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:50,997
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own,
but I only bring in people I like.

1055
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,042
Okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

1056
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,211
I introduce you to my hookup.
How's that sound?

1057
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,463
- Cool with me.
- My man.

1058
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,423
That is my man...

1059
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,384
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

1060
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,180
Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

1061
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,640
Yo, yo.

1062
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,229
Come on!

1063
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,316
I love dick"?

1064
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,901
You think that's funny?

1065
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,486
<i>"Wonder Years douche"?</i>

1066
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,780
What kind of a sick animal draws

1067
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:27,325
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?

1068
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:30,453
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

1069
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,914
You think I don't know
that's a dick and balls?

1070
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,916
I know all about dick and balls!

1071
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,377
I partied with Robert Downey Jr.
before he got sober,

1072
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,713
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!

1073
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,840
You know what?
From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

1074
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:44,217
You're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,

1075
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,929
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...

1076
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,270
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

1077
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,147
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

1078
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,941
and I had Zack put
this monitoring device in it,

1079
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:03,194
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.

1080
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,196
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

1081
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,239
What?

1082
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:08,283
- What if you had gotten found out?
- But it worked.

1083
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,243
This is, like,
the smartest move I've ever pulled,

1084
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,954
so, I'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?

1085
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:15,957
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad you have something to do.

1086
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,502
Good.

1087
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:24,049
What's up?

1088
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,056
Great job, Schmidt.

1089
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,032
- Password!
- Kneel before Zod!

1090
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:50,408
You may enter.

1091
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:52,077
Thank you, Zod.

1092
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:01,294
Let's tap that wire, huh?

1093
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,129
We were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.

1094
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:05,006
We were going to test what blows up.

1095
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:08,343
There's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right?

1096
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,638
Not that I can think of
that would make sense.

1097
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,640
Go for it, go for it.

1098
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,517
- Look out.
- Go, go, go!

1099
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:19,562
Yes!

1100
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,856
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

1101
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,358
That's what I'm talking about!

1102
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:24,901
I love this science shit!

1103
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:27,403
This is what you guys do all day?
Let's do it again.

1104
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,255
Are you texting Molly?

1105
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:46,756
What?

1106
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,675
I don't... Molly...

1107
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:50,635
Maybe. Is that...

1108
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,346
Whoa, it's cool, man, come on.

1109
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,599
I'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.

1110
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:59,310
I mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.

1111
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:02,522
I just, like... I don't know,
I don't believe in possessions, ja feel?

1112
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:05,400
Ja feel, ja definitely feel.

1113
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,485
- Yeah.
- Schmidty?

1114
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,238
Schmidty.

1115
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,407
Phyllis.

1116
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,076
- I'll be right back, dude.
- Okay.

1117
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:19,372
Hey. How are you?

1118
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,666
- How is my favorite police officer?
- Okay.

1119
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:24,294
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

1120
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:25,879
Listen, now is not a really good time.

1121
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,922
Are you undercover right now?

1122
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:29,465
Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

1123
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:31,259
Are those the bad guys over there?

1124
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:34,179
Do they have guns? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, this is so exciting.

1125
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:36,097
I have got to call Annie. She is gonna die.

1126
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:39,100
I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

1127
00:58:39,184 --> 00:58:40,810
- Where is my phone?
- Okay, okay.

1128
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,187
Shut your fucking mouth.

1129
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,397
Shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?

1130
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,316
Let's go check this out.

1131
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,526
I will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.

1132
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,695
- There is no...
- A straight-up face punch.

1133
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:51,905
I swear to God, you're gonna get me killed.

1134
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,406
- Hey, yo.
- That is...

1135
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:57,118
Shit! She just tried to grab my dick, dude!

1136
00:58:57,202 --> 00:58:59,412
- What? You tried to grab his...
- She tried to grab my junk.

1137
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,039
She was like, "Oh, my God, I have arthritis,

1138
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,790
"it hurts my hand,
I need to grab a handful of that dick."

1139
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,000
I was like, "Get the fuck off me!"

1140
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,460
She said, "I need to grab
a handful of that dick"?

1141
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,170
And it felt good,
but then it felt weird for a second,

1142
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:09,339
so I pushed her. We got to get out of here.

1143
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:10,423
All right, cool, let's get the...

1144
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:30,526
So your parents are just cool
with having people over whenever?

1145
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,362
Yeah, you know, they're out most nights.

1146
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:34,155
Pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.

1147
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,950
You're so lucky your parents
don't give a shit about you.

1148
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,243
Right?

1149
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,161
- This place is awesome.
- Yeah.

1150
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,454
Hey.

1151
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:42,914
Hey, what's up?

1152
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,457
How's it going?

1153
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,460
Wow, that's a bigger hug
than I was expecting.

1154
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:49,629
Sorry. I'm happy to see you.

1155
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:51,297
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

1156
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,966
-Hey.
-Hey.

1157
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,386
Good?

1158
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:58,012
- All right, come on.
- Yeah, let's...

1159
00:59:58,096 --> 01:00:00,348
I brought tacos, so that's cool.

1160
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:03,268
<i>Try to turn it, try to turn it, spoiler alert</i>

1161
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:06,020
<i>Spoiler alert, spoiler alert!</i>

1162
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:10,942
Hey, boys, this eco-pussy
is going down today.

1163
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,695
<i>Take down eco-pussy</i>

1164
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:16,531
<i>Take down eco-pussy!</i>

1165
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,035
<i>Mother Earth, Mother Earth is dying</i>

1166
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,913
<i>And when it rains</i>

1167
01:00:23,997 --> 01:00:25,873
<i>It means that beautiful bitch is crying</i>

1168
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:27,917
- It's really not a planet.
- It's for sure a planet.

1169
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:29,794
Pluto is a planet.

1170
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:30,920
- It's ready!
- It used to be a planet.

1171
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:32,046
- It's ready.
- Not any more.

1172
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,300
<i>Reduce, reuse</i>

1173
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,552
<i>Recycle</i>

1174
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:38,761
I'm embarrassed.

1175
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,222
- I always feel exposed after playing.
- Do not feel exposed.

1176
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,390
I got to use the bathroom.

1177
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,392
- Is it in there?
- Yeah, yeah, right up there, dude.

1178
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,477
All right, all right, all right, all right.
God damn that.

1179
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:49,022
The mic is live and we can
hear how the other half lives.

1180
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,496
What are you doing?

1181
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,123
I heard something.

1182
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:09,334
<i>Hey, can I ask you something? Sit down.</i>

1183
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,585
<i>Okay.</i>

1184
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:14,172
I just want to make sure
that you and Eric are going to be careful

1185
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:17,884
with whatever it is
that you're getting involved in.

1186
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,928
Yeah, I promise we will.

1187
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:23,389
It would just suck
if something bad happened,

1188
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,559
because you're a good guy.

1189
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:29,854
Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you,

1190
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,773
except girl version.

1191
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:33,608
You're a girl.

1192
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:35,443
- I am.
- Yeah.

1193
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:37,528
That's why I put this dress on,

1194
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:39,030
-to remind you.
- Exactly.

1195
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:42,116
- Are you excited about the play?
- Yes.

1196
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,284
Yeah, you were just

1197
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:44,410
-right in there with excitement.
- Yes.

1198
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:45,870
- No hesitash.
- I'm very excited.

1199
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,497
Yeah.

1200
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:49,207
Does that make me a super nerd?

1201
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,917
No, not at all.

1202
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,418
<i>We get to act together.</i>

1203
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:55,380
What a vagina. He has no chance with her.

1204
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:56,547
<i>So...</i>

1205
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:57,882
- Shit.
- Sorry.

1206
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,759
You're on the prom committee.

1207
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,344
Do you think it's going to be fun?

1208
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:02,762
Did she just bring up prom on her own?

1209
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,639
- She did, she just brought up prom.
- What is she doing?

1210
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,349
I think it's going to be awesome.

1211
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:07,850
- Prom eats a dong.
- Multiple dongs.

1212
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:09,018
All right, anyone who says

1213
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:11,896
they don't care about prom
actually secretly does.

1214
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,065
Who we gonna take to the prom?
No one's going to prom with us.

1215
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:17,402
Come on, picture it.
You pull up in a white stallion of a limo.

1216
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:19,112
You got fine-ass honeys with you.

1217
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:21,364
You're dressed to the nines
with your best buds.

1218
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:23,449
Doves fly out behind you, slow motion.

1219
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:25,243
Doves. Why doves?

1220
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:28,955
'Cause doves make you look
like a bad ass, that's why.

1221
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,748
I am pretty skeptical,

1222
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:36,003
but maybe, if someone fun asked me,
I would go.

1223
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:40,091
Aren't... Isn't... Aren't you and Eric...

1224
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,759
Wouldn't you and Eric go together?

1225
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:44,720
Not that I know of.

1226
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,188
Would you...

1227
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:55,314
He's going to choke.

1228
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:58,067
He always chokes.
He's going to choke, wait for it.

1229
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:01,446
So would...

1230
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:03,239
So would...

1231
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:05,992
Would you...

1232
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:08,953
Mayb...

1233
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:12,248
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1234
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:15,418
That is the actual sound of choking.

1235
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:19,380
I was wondering if you...

1236
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,258
Would you

1237
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,553
maybe want to go

1238
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:28,681
with me to prom?

1239
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,892
Would you want to go to me...
Maybe with me to prom?

1240
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,560
Yes.

1241
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:35,688
I would love to go to prom with you.

1242
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,483
What? She just said yes!

1243
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:40,026
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1244
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:42,195
Good for you, Doug.

1245
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,405
Thank you for asking.

1246
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:53,748
Put her there, man.

1247
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:55,750
Just put... Put it right there.

1248
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:59,337
I'm putting it right there.

1249
01:03:59,629 --> 01:04:01,339
<i>Yeah. There you guys are.</i>

1250
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:02,965
<i>What's up, my man?</i>

1251
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,050
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1252
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:05,801
- Whazzup?
- Yeah.

1253
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:09,222
Doug... Okay, settle an argument.

1254
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,057
You and your brother aren't related, right?

1255
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,350
'Cause you look totally different.

1256
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:13,768
He's adopted.

1257
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,103
<i>We all suspect from a very lame family.</i>

1258
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:18,814
<i>Where is he tonight?</i>

1259
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,693
<i>Probably at home with those lame tools
he hangs outwith. I don't know.</i>

1260
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:25,363
You know how Tom Cruise is
always pissed off at Rain Man?

1261
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:28,991
That's like my life,
except Brad is really shitty at math.

1262
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:32,912
Your brother's kind of a dick.

1263
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,539
Well, yeah,

1264
01:04:36,082 --> 01:04:37,458
he kind of is, isn't he?

1265
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,793
Don't listen to that.

1266
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,878
I don't give a fuck.

1267
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:49,387
Dude, Eric is the funniest IM-er.

1268
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:57,687
Oh, fuck.

1269
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,816
Hey, guys. It's so funny seeing you here.

1270
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,568
How are you? Guess what, I don't care.

1271
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:06,112
We just closed our third
high school operation.

1272
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:08,114
And check what we found at Kennedy.

1273
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,783
Looks like we're going to have to do
your job for you.

1274
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:14,161
Your drugs is spreading
to different schools now, sucker.

1275
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:20,376
You failed to stop the outbreak,
and you have no leads!

1276
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,503
We are running out of time!

1277
01:05:22,587 --> 01:05:24,338
You either find the supplier,

1278
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:26,924
or I'm gonna jump your asses
off Jump Street!

1279
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:28,968
I totally understand
where you're coming from, sir,

1280
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,470
but, look, I heard Eric
talking on the phone yesterday

1281
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:33,723
with somebody that sounded very suspect

1282
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,975
about meeting up with a stuffed pifiata.

1283
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,729
Is that a code for sex?

1284
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:44,275
- Pifiata? Really?
- Yep.

1285
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,235
Remember that wiretap
I put on Eric's phone?

1286
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,030
While you were having the time of your life
last night, I was listening.

1287
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,949
I overheard a phone call between Eric
and some dude about a pifiata.

1288
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,202
That's all you heard?

1289
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:56,871
Yep.

1290
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,043
<i>I am so nervous.</i>

1291
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:05,212
We are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.

1292
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:07,757
I apologize in advance
if I throw up on you onstage.

1293
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,967
Serious question, though.

1294
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,261
How do I look?

1295
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,263
Ravishing.

1296
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,807
Is it too sexy of an outfit?

1297
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,184
Bend the knee a little bit.

1298
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,644
Yep, it is.

1299
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:25,066
It's going to be so much easier
having you onstage with me.

1300
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,651
I am so happy that I met you.

1301
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:30,029
You're, like, the only guy
that I can really trust.

1302
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:32,573
Yep. That's me.

1303
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,492
Doug.

1304
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,582
Potassium nitrate.

1305
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,461
Don't hate. It's great.

1306
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,338
It can act as an oxidizer.

1307
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:49,256
I didn't know that, but now I'm wiser.

1308
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:53,052
It has a crystalline structure.

1309
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:55,930
If you can't respect that,
you're a butt muncher.

1310
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:58,891
It's a key ingredient in gunpowder.

1311
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:02,019
K-NO-three, don't give no grief.

1312
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:05,314
It can be used to make corned beef.

1313
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:09,151
It's also known as saltpeter.

1314
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:16,283
- Brad?
- Shit.

1315
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:18,035
Where are you going?

1316
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:20,287
I don't want to look like
it's like I'm wearing makeup.

1317
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,081
- Right.
- Doug! Hi.

1318
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,541
Brad!

1319
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:24,834
Whoa. What are you wearing?

1320
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:26,502
Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.

1321
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:27,795
I need to borrow you.

1322
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:29,547
Now's not a good time, Brad.

1323
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:31,382
It's a really good time.

1324
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:35,636
'Cause my pifiata is killing me.

1325
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,722
Is that code for a sex thing?

1326
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,432
It's leaving the parking lot.

1327
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:40,683
Pifiata?

1328
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,770
Molly,

1329
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:46,814
I will be right back.
I need to help Brad with something, okay?

1330
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,482
I just need to help Brad
with something real quick.

1331
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:49,692
- What? No. What?
- I promise you...

1332
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,527
Do you understand how soon
the show is starting?

1333
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,195
I swear to you
I will be back in time for curtain.

1334
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:55,114
- I swear. I swear to you.
- Tell me you understand how soon...

1335
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,158
What? Are you kidding me?

1336
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:00,911
What did I say? What did I say?

1337
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:03,873
See? Whose wiretap is
working for him now, huh?

1338
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:14,759
Shit.

1339
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:16,177
Fuck!

1340
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:18,637
You told me not to worry about the tickets!

1341
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:20,890
I thought they made us look cool.

1342
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:23,100
- Cones, cones...
- Driver's ed car.

1343
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:24,226
- I'm driving.
- No, you're not.

1344
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:27,229
- I never get to drive. I'm driving this time.
- Fine! Drive!

1345
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,273
- Hey, guys.
- Just borrowing this for one sec.

1346
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,442
- Sure.
- Go. Go, go, go, go.

1347
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:33,611
Guys, hey, wait. Guys, you're not on the list.

1348
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:35,988
Hey, guys, wait! Who cares?

1349
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:53,756
- Holy fucking shit.
- No fucking way.

1350
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,716
Those are the guys from the park.

1351
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,092
That's just too crazy.

1352
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,471
What do you think's in that thing?

1353
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,223
I don't know, money, drugs.

1354
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,767
They could be a new buyer,
or they could be the supplier.

1355
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,727
If it's good, you'll hear from me.

1356
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:10,314
If it's not good, you'll hear from me
about telling you how it's not good.

1357
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:11,482
Makes sense.

1358
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,984
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, no worries, man.

1359
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,736
I'll see you guys.

1360
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,072
We definitely got to follow
them and find out, though.

1361
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,493
- Get down! Get down!
- Get down! Get down!

1362
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,206
- What are you doing?
- If they see us,

1363
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:28,541
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1364
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,125
- What? No!
- Yes. Stop.

1365
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,794
You pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1366
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,504
No, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1367
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:34,922
Why am I automatically blowing you?

1368
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,132
'Cause you're in
a fucking Peter Pan costume!

1369
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:38,300
Okay.

1370
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:45,516
Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1371
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,059
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, fine, we'll follow them.

1372
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:49,103
But we need to be back in
30 minutes for curtain.

1373
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:56,527
Dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?

1374
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,653
Yeah, you're following too close, dude.

1375
01:09:57,778 --> 01:09:59,446
- They're going to make us.
- Well, if I go too far back,

1376
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,365
it's going to look even
more suspicious, so just stop.

1377
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:02,616
God, just let me do my thing.

1378
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,326
I know what I'm doing.

1379
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:09,081
Seriously, if you do that again,
I'm going to Whac-A-Mole you in the balls.

1380
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,207
Just stay back.

1381
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:13,168
- I could not be more serious.
- Take your foot off the brake.

1382
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:15,629
- No. I'm not... No.
- Take your foot off the brake!

1383
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,014
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1384
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,390
- Look what you did!
- Look what you did!

1385
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,393
What the fuck?
You non-driving motherfuckers!

1386
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,270
Get the fuck out of the car!

1387
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,939
- Oh, fuck.
- Lock the door! Lock the door!

1388
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:35,149
What do I do? Go away!

1389
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:36,483
What are you, a fucking Keebler Elf?

1390
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:38,986
Get him out of that car!

1391
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:42,698
- No,no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

1392
01:10:42,823 --> 01:10:44,491
- No, no! No, no, no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

1393
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:45,576
Like an angry walrus!

1394
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,245
- I stomp the car now!
- Oh, my God!

1395
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,665
- Stomp! Stomp!
- Oh, shit.

1396
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:54,043
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God! Stop, dude! Go!

1397
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,506
Ch, my God! Oh, my God!

1398
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:05,095
- Just let me drive!
- Stop hitting me!

1399
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,939
Dude, watch out!

1400
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:18,734
Will you stop front-seat driving?
Get your hands off the wheel!

1401
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,611
Man, you just hit two people back there!

1402
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,696
- You stop. I'm not...
- Take your hands off. Shit!

1403
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:28,619
- We're stuck in traffic!
- Oh, shit.

1404
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:30,996
- Shit, they're coming! They're coming!
- What?

1405
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,831
Oh, my God, dude.

1406
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:33,999
What do we do?

1407
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,292
What the... What the...

1408
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:37,169
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1409
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,629
Oh, shit.

1410
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:40,089
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong with you? Run!

1411
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:42,049
I can't! I'm wearing tights!

1412
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:44,510
I got skinny jeans on!
It's the same fucking thing!

1413
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,555
They're going to make us, or kill us.

1414
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,809
- Porsche! Porsche!
- Police! Get out of the car, douche!

1415
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,477
I'm on a call here, jackass.

1416
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,855
That's right. Go to sleep, bitch.
You just got head-butted, motherfucker!

1417
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,190
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit.

1418
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:04,071
Check around for a gun or something,
all right?

1419
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,489
Where? Where?
There's no glove compartment

1420
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,701
in this shitty-ass car!
There's golf balls and this.

1421
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:10,661
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- I don't know, man!

1422
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,371
I've never been in a freeway chase before!

1423
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:30,014
Watch out! It's going to explode!
It's going to go!

1424
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,683
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1425
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,018
- It just didn't explode.
- That's weird.

1426
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,398
Can anybody tell me where my Peter is?

1427
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:43,527
French! You're not my first choice,
but I need you to go on as Peter.

1428
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,738
Oh, gosh. And I've been in character
for months now.

1429
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:47,573
Great. Nobody cares.

1430
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,950
Come on! Another traffic jam?

1431
01:12:51,035 --> 01:12:53,037
I'm sorry I didn't check the traffic report

1432
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,955
-before we got in a car chase!
- Let's go! Come on!

1433
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,083
- Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Shit!

1434
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:01,879
- Are you texting?
- No, I'm not texting!

1435
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:04,131
- Yes, you are! You're texting!
- No, I'm not!

1436
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,215
Okay, almost done.

1437
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:08,135
"LOL."

1438
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:11,722
I'm driving!

1439
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:13,640
Why do you always jump
over the car like that?

1440
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:14,933
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1441
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:16,393
- Hi.
- God damn, you are beautiful.

1442
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:18,729
- Oh. Hi.
- You are fine as shit.

1443
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:20,105
Don't worry. Someone will pick you up.

1444
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:22,024
- Wow.
- Hurry. Just drive.

1445
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:23,650
Wait. Pick me up?

1446
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,739
- They're coming! They're coming!
- I got an idea.

1447
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,991
Why don't you text them
and ask them to stop chasing us?

1448
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:38,207
Oh, shit!

1449
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:41,752
He's got a gun!

1450
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:42,795
I'm going to throw this thing at him!

1451
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:43,962
Okay, you don't have to narrate everything!

1452
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:45,422
- Just throw it!
- Okay! Okay, okay!

1453
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:03,440
- It's going to explode!
- Oh, my God! Roll up the windows!

1454
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:04,691
- What the fuck is that going to do?
- Roll it up!

1455
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:05,901
- I don't fucking care! Just do it!
- Oh, God!

1456
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:15,244
I really thought that one
was going to explode.

1457
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,835
Oh, shit!

1458
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,630
Look in the glove compartment for a gun.

1459
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:28,340
What are you talking about?
We're in a pink Bug!

1460
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:31,426
I don't care.
Look in the goddamn glove compartment!

1461
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,011
What the hell?

1462
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:39,226
- Shoot.
- Oh, my God. Okay! Okay!

1463
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,186
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

1464
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,397
Can't get a good shot, man!
I can't get a good shot!

1465
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,065
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Take the shot!

1466
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:46,483
Take the shot! Just shoot him! Let's go!

1467
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:47,901
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1468
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,361
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Shit, shit...

1469
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,921
That's what exploded? Holy shit.
That was crazy.

1470
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:09,423
Why did you shoot for me?

1471
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:11,175
You weren't shooting, you were choking,

1472
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:12,759
-so I had to save us.
- I was going to shoot.

1473
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:15,220
- You always do this, every single time.
- What?

1474
01:15:15,304 --> 01:15:17,014
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.

1475
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,517
If I miss this play, Molly's going to freak out
and she's not going to go to prom with me.

1476
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:22,603
- Are you fucking serious right now?
- Fuck, yes, I'm serious!

1477
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,151
Can't believe you made me late.
You're so selfish.

1478
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,153
- I'm selfish?
- Yes, you're selfish!

1479
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:32,362
Are you fucking kidding me?

1480
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:33,864
Look at yourself!

1481
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:36,783
You're in too deep, man.

1482
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,661
Yesterday, I found
a college application on your desk!

1483
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,955
I don't know how long this case
is going to last.

1484
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,626
And Eric's going to get into Berkeley,
and, honestly, I can get in, too.

1485
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:48,378
Who knows? I could ride this thing out.
I could be a doctor or something.

1486
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:49,796
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1487
01:15:49,922 --> 01:15:52,132
You screwed this investigation all up.

1488
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,760
At least I know my Miranda rights, you idiot.

1489
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:02,309
You are a very silly man indeed.

1490
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,519
Boys, squaws, come quickly.

1491
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:08,106
Hey! Sorry! It's okay. I'm here.

1492
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:10,359
I know I missed the first few scenes.

1493
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:12,819
I want to thank...
Give it up to French Samuels

1494
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:16,240
-for ably backing me up.
- Fuck you, Doug! What?

1495
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:18,325
I say we just roll right into this thing, huh?

1496
01:16:20,953 --> 01:16:22,996
This is my twin. We're together in...

1497
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,331
Get the fuck out of here.

1498
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:28,001
What are you doing?
Have you completely lost your mind?

1499
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:29,544
What is this?

1500
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,922
I don't know, but it's already more exciting.

1501
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,465
You're embarrassing me.

1502
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:34,800
It's okay. I'll make it up to you.

1503
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:38,011
And... Let's fly!

1504
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,850
- Such bullshit!
- Get off of me!

1505
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,438
I'm not dumb! I'm smart!

1506
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:50,482
You think I'm stupid? You're stupid!

1507
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:53,318
- Go, Doug!
- I guess I should do something.

1508
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:55,112
I should probably not
just stand here watching.

1509
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:56,571
I should take action.

1510
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:58,031
Worst best friend ever!

1511
01:17:03,787 --> 01:17:04,955
Molly, I'm sorry!

1512
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,957
I don't want to talk to you ever again.

1513
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,208
I'm sorry.

1514
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,257
You stupid idiot!

1515
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,639
- Come here!
- Come on!

1516
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:31,898
Make fun of me behind my back
and everybody laughs at me?

1517
01:17:32,024 --> 01:17:35,319
I was a loser for four years!
You couldn't handle it for five minutes!

1518
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:37,529
Have some fairy dust, motherfucker!

1519
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:41,825
Hey, guys, no!

1520
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:46,246
I heard you call me Rain Man, you asshole!

1521
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,540
Principal Dadier sucks dick!

1522
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:52,878
You're supposed to be my friend!

1523
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:56,631
Stop! Stop it. You're expelled.
Both of you are expelled.

1524
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:02,012
And that's the end of Act Two.

1525
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,951
Is that it? You're not going to scream at us?

1526
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:26,787
Nope.

1527
01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:29,498
I'm gonna just fire you.

1528
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,465
Moving out?

1529
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:21,758
Yep.

1530
01:19:24,344 --> 01:19:26,430
You know what's crazy to me

1531
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:29,307
is that I think that I actually
thought that we were brothers.

1532
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,687
I would've tooken a bullet for you.

1533
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,946
Get in now. Both of you.

1534
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:44,156
Why should I?

1535
01:19:45,157 --> 01:19:46,158
Just get in the car, man.

1536
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:48,618
Get in the fucking car.

1537
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:50,162
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

1538
01:19:51,997 --> 01:19:53,623
Please get in the car.

1539
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,922
Come on, you guys. Come on. Please. Jesus.

1540
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,135
Some messed up shit went down yesterday.

1541
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:07,137
Yeah, after we made the exchange,

1542
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,724
our potential business partners
got followed by some fucking cops.

1543
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,225
That's insane, man.

1544
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,643
Are you serious?

1545
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:15,854
Okay, it's just I don't want to go to jail!

1546
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:18,315
You know what happens to
a handsome guy like me in jail?

1547
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:20,150
It rhymes with "grape"!

1548
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:22,277
It rhymes with "grape."

1549
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:24,529
I can't let that happen.

1550
01:20:24,613 --> 01:20:25,739
So I got these from my dad's gun cabinet.

1551
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:27,491
- Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.
- Whoa. Come on. Whoa.

1552
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:31,369
Springfield .45s, police issue.
Very powerful guns.

1553
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,622
You ever use one?

1554
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:37,000
- We're not really gun people, man. No.
- No?

1555
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:40,378
A lot of things
have made me wonder about you.

1556
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:41,505
Come on.

1557
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:44,007
Your taste in music.

1558
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,760
The fact that you look
like a fucking 40-year-old man.

1559
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,680
Then after that shit at the play, I realized

1560
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,019
there's no way you guys could be cops.

1561
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:01,024
Yeah, I got this deal going down.
The supplier's going to be there.

1562
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,318
I need people I can trust.

1563
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,571
All right. All right, come on.

1564
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:08,323
Okay, right over here,
we're going to shoot these bottles.

1565
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:09,783
- We're going to practice, okay?
- Okay.

1566
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:23,255
That was... That was actually
really fuckin' awesome.

1567
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:24,589
Beginner's luck.

1568
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,007
All right.

1569
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:27,717
The supplier wants the deal
to go down at prom.

1570
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:29,302
All right, there's going to be
all these heavies there,

1571
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:30,929
but as long as you guys have my back...

1572
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:32,847
Yeah? Yeah? Shit.

1573
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,683
I always got your back.

1574
01:21:35,684 --> 01:21:37,727
Time to get our jobs back.

1575
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,356
Let's get ready for prom.

1576
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,540
Schmidty! Chore time!

1577
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:00,959
Mom, we don't have time
for chores right now!

1578
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,879
If you stay in this house,
you have time for chores!

1579
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,256
Mom!

1580
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,815
Fuck this thing.

1581
01:22:29,404 --> 01:22:30,572
Here.

1582
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,741
It'll be quicker if I help.

1583
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:35,994
There you go.

1584
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:38,830
Thanks.

1585
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:47,088
Your shotgun's hanging too low.

1586
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:48,798
They're gonna see it.

1587
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:53,219
Thanks.

1588
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,312
Jenko“.

1589
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:09,861
Will you go to prom with me?

1590
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:15,367
I guess.

1591
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:21,206
Are we really going to take down
a whole drug operation by ourselves?

1592
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,127
I got some contacts that'll help us.

1593
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:10,213
Brad, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

1594
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,381
What if the principal sees you?

1595
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,675
- This is wrong, yet so right.
- What?

1596
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,052
I am so happy you're willing
to get in trouble for me.

1597
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:18,680
You have to go. Please, don't leave me ever.

1598
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:20,014
Ms. Griggs, stop. Stop.

1599
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:21,474
- Stay! Stay.
- Stop.

1600
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:23,226
- What?
- Stay.

1601
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:24,602
- Go!
- Okay_

1602
01:24:24,686 --> 01:24:25,937
- Stay.
- Stop. Stop-

1603
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,731
- I'm lost without you.
- What?

1604
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,817
Get out of me. I'm going to throw up.

1605
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:33,111
You are so hot!

1606
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:36,114
All right.

1607
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:43,246
Hey, pumpkin head.

1608
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:45,665
I'm very mad at you. Dance with me.

1609
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:47,709
- Are you on that shit?
- So what if I am?

1610
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:50,754
Look, Molly, some serious stuff
is about to go down,

1611
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:53,047
and I don't want you to get hurt.

1612
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:55,550
I've already been hurt, Doug. I don't care.

1613
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:59,596
You need to leave. You need to leave.
You need to get out of here right now.

1614
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,431
Making a lot of hand gestures!

1615
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:04,225
Okay, my name's not Doug.

1616
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:05,602
- It's Schmidt.
- What?

1617
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:07,270
- And I'm a cop.
- What?

1618
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:11,065
Okay, and I care about you,
and I don't want you to get busted,

1619
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:13,276
so you have to leave right now.

1620
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:15,028
Leave the prom right now, Molly.

1621
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,613
- I'm serious.
- Hey. Hey.

1622
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:17,989
Penthouse now. Supplier's waiting.

1623
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,282
- What are you?
- Come on. Hey, come on.

1624
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:20,867
- Supplier's waiting.
- Is that Eric?

1625
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,994
- Molly, leave right now.
- What are you...

1626
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:25,497
- Just leave right now!
- What is this?

1627
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:40,804
Mr. Walters?

1628
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,680
Hey!

1629
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:45,266
Beautiful Brad, and his brother.

1630
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,684
Wow. You look great.

1631
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:48,269
You're the supplier? You're a teacher.

1632
01:25:48,353 --> 01:25:49,979
And I was stuck on a teacher's salary, bro.

1633
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:52,565
Could barely pay my alimony.
What are you gonna do?

1634
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:54,567
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,486
You boys are so good at this.

1636
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:58,154
Oh, yeah, Cinnamon!

1637
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:00,824
Oh, my God,
we're getting such good evidence.

1638
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,659
<i>I stole some of that Bunsen burner crap</i>

1639
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:05,036
from the chem lab,
threw in some of my Cool Deets,

1640
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:07,080
<i>and it was muy delicioso!</i>

1641
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:09,415
Then one day I catch
Eco Butt-munch over here

1642
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,251
smoking a J.J. behind the field house,

1643
01:26:11,334 --> 01:26:13,211
and I'm like,
"Hey, you want to make some coin?"

1644
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,255
What a green penis that guy is, huh?

1645
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:18,299
There's my quesadilla.

1646
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:21,427
I hurt my hands!

1647
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:23,429
Bitch.

1648
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:31,938
Oh, shit.

1649
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:34,357
You guys look crazy scary.

1650
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,525
How many of you are there?

1651
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:36,860
A lot.

1652
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,111
Karl.

1653
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:39,863
Patch looks pimp, man.

1654
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:41,781
Thank you.

1655
01:26:42,532 --> 01:26:44,033
He's gonna recognize us, man.

1656
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:45,577
I'm freaking out.

1657
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,287
This is Walters, he made the stuff.

1658
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:49,873
- Real pleasure to meet you.
- Fuck what his name is.

1659
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:51,207
Your shit's good.

1660
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:53,251
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

1661
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:54,544
What, you having a party now?

1662
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,462
Who are these two motherfuckers?

1663
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:57,547
Fuck!

1664
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,175
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

1665
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:04,012
Nah, nah, it's cool, man,
they're my boys, so...

1666
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,471
- Are they?
- Yeah.

1667
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:06,973
I don't like strangers.

1668
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:09,976
How do you ever expect
to make any new friends with that attitude?

1669
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,896
It's, like, everyone's a stranger
till you give them a chance, man.

1670
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,397
What the fuck are you talking about?

1671
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
I don't even...

1672
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,150
Just fuckin' around.

1673
01:27:17,609 --> 01:27:19,193
Do your thing, man. Proceed

1674
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,488
Hey, kid, come here.

1675
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:24,657
You, you look familiar.

1676
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,659
- Me?
- Yeah.

1677
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:31,164
I was in a French fry commercial
when I was a kid,

1678
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,625
so people are like, you know, often say,
"Oh, I think I know you,"

1679
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,835
but I don't think we've ever met before.

1680
01:27:35,919 --> 01:27:38,129
Do I look like I eat French fries?

1681
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:40,256
I don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,

1682
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:44,636
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day,
like a carb blowout, you know? I don't know.

1683
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:45,887
Nah.

1684
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,388
Yeah, the theme song was, like...

1685
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:52,685
<i>Come to Andrew's French Fry Emporium</i>

1686
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:56,064
<i>Where friendship and French fries</i>

1687
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:58,608
<i>Go hand in hand</i>

1688
01:28:02,612 --> 01:28:04,030
That's my quesadilla!

1689
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:05,239
Who wants a piece? Huh?

1690
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,158
I know you're in there, Doug,
or whatever your name is!

1691
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,284
You lied to me!

1692
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,873
I'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!

1693
01:28:13,957 --> 01:28:16,709
Hey, you guys, she just called me
a stupid fucking cock. That's rude.

1694
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,212
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

1695
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:22,215
Did she just say
"nickhead dark motherfucker"?

1696
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,633
That's just racist.

1697
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:25,176
I know these two.

1698
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:26,928
Your boys are cops! They're cops!

1699
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:28,221
Police! Get on the ground!

1700
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,223
You get on the fuckin' ground!

1701
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,266
- We asked you first!
- I don't give a damn!

1702
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,018
You're fucking cops?

1703
01:28:34,102 --> 01:28:35,937
But we partied together, man.

1704
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,564
You bought us Taco Bell.

1705
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,984
Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.

1706
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:42,568
You made me this friendship bracelet.

1707
01:28:42,694 --> 01:28:45,488
Well, he's not really your friend.
He was pretending the whole time.

1708
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:47,573
I'm gonna cut this the fuck off later, all right?

1709
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:50,576
What the fuck is going on?

1710
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,286
Shut this kid up!

1711
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,456
- Him, too.
- No, no! Hey, wait!

1712
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:56,708
No, no, no. Listen, I'm with you guys!

1713
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:57,917
I didn't know these guys were cops!

1714
01:28:58,001 --> 01:28:59,252
I'm getting out of here.

1715
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:00,753
I fucking hate you!

1716
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,088
Get that out of my face!

1717
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:04,090
- Molly!
- Oh, there you are!

1718
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:06,175
What the fuck!

1719
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,720
Drop your guns, or I'll spray her brains
all over the room!

1720
01:29:08,803 --> 01:29:11,180
Trying to take a hostage,
some goddamn TV show shit?

1721
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:14,308
I don't know! I'm trying to help, all right?
I've never done this shit before.

1722
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,435
Well, you're fucking up.

1723
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:18,187
- Drop the guns or she's dead!
- She looks dead already.

1724
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:19,814
What? No.

1725
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:21,524
Jesus.

1726
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:24,027
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

1727
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:26,320
She just passed out from the drugs.
We're good.

1728
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:27,488
Drop the guns or...

1729
01:29:27,572 --> 01:29:29,157
All right, all right, just chill out.

1730
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,950
We're gonna drop our guns.

1731
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:34,203
You got to let the kids go,
and no one's gonna die, okay?

1732
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:36,372
Just drop the guns, and kick them over here.

1733
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:40,084
D.B., shoot these motherfuckers.

1734
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:42,545
Oh, come on, that's unfair!
We put our guns down in good faith.

1735
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:44,297
You're a liar, and you're mean!

1736
01:29:45,048 --> 01:29:46,883
- That's unfair.
- We're all friends here.

1737
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,343
Let's just relax, and we can
all leave here as friends.

1738
01:29:49,427 --> 01:29:51,721
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Y'all boys are stupid.

1739
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:55,433
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

1740
01:29:56,142 --> 01:29:57,268
God damn it!

1741
01:29:57,602 --> 01:29:59,479
Tom Hanson, DEA! On your knees!

1742
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:00,605
What the fuck?

1743
01:30:00,688 --> 01:30:02,565
- Now!
- Fuck!

1744
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,734
Doug Penhall, DEA! You're under arrest!

1745
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:06,944
Guns down, all of you! Domingo, tell them!

1746
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,822
Put them down.

1747
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:11,449
Nice! Yes!

1748
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:13,534
Shut the fuck up!

1749
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:16,871
You little dweebs just ruined
a five-year investigation.

1750
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:18,081
We had no idea.

1751
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:19,540
You're, like, an amazing actor, man.

1752
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:22,126
You played saxophone
at my sister's wedding, man!

1753
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,711
Tough titty. I fucked her, too.

1754
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:25,213
What?

1755
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:26,589
You little turds.

1756
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:29,467
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to infiltrate a gang like this?

1757
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,222
Do you see this nose?

1758
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,890
That is a fake nose.

1759
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,934
Do you want to wear a fake nose
on your fuckin' head

1760
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,852
for, like, months on end? Glue and shit?

1761
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,271
Worse things in the world.

1762
01:30:42,355 --> 01:30:44,607
We had to get fuckin' tattoos
on our dicks, man.

1763
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,567
Hey, actually, I just said that

1764
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,319
-to mess with you.
- What?

1765
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:49,779
Looks tough.

1766
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:52,532
Look, we know what
it's like being undercover.

1767
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:53,825
Metro Police, Jump Street Division.

1768
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:54,992
Come on, you guys are Jump Street?

1769
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:56,119
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1770
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:58,162
That's funny, because
we were actually Jump Street.

1771
01:30:58,246 --> 01:30:59,705
- What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1772
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:01,290
Oh, shit!

1773
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:03,209
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

1774
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,293
Oh, my God, dude!

1775
01:31:04,377 --> 01:31:05,628
Get them!

1776
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,338
Motherfucker!

1777
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:10,883
Shoot them!

1778
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:13,302
Fuck that.

1779
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,731
That was a gun.

1780
01:31:25,857 --> 01:31:27,066
Somebody definitely got shot.

1781
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,071
All right.

1782
01:31:33,114 --> 01:31:35,575
Here, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

1783
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:46,210
Did I hit anything?

1784
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:47,920
You were shooting at the fuckin' ceiling.

1785
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,964
Doug.

1786
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:53,968
I know sometimes I was a jerk to you

1787
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:55,970
when we were undercover.

1788
01:32:01,309 --> 01:32:04,270
It's just... I didn't feel good about myself.

1789
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:10,109
All that stuff I wore, like the bracelets,
the rings, the tight pants,

1790
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:12,862
was just so

1791
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:15,364
that people would think I'm cool.

1792
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,533
The only approval

1793
01:32:18,618 --> 01:32:20,328
that I ever needed

1794
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,664
was my best friend.

1795
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:25,958
Thanks, man.

1796
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:46,562
The money's gone!

1797
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:48,022
Come on, let's roll.

1798
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:49,440
We gotta get out of here, man.

1799
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:50,775
Are you telling me it's on?

1800
01:32:51,234 --> 01:32:52,985
- Let's do this.
- Let's make a baby.

1801
01:32:53,361 --> 01:32:54,820
- What? What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1802
01:32:54,946 --> 01:32:56,489
I was trying to sound cool. Sorry.

1803
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:50,418
That was crazy! You killed a guy!

1804
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,212
Oh, fuckin' shit!

1805
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:57,008
Hey, hey, we'll lose them in the prom! Go!

1806
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:19,572
Go, go, go, go!

1807
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:22,867
Where'd they go?

1808
01:34:25,411 --> 01:34:26,412
Molly!

1809
01:34:31,459 --> 01:34:32,501
Shit!

1810
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,007
- You want to drive?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

1811
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,258
Okay, cool.

1812
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:42,428
- Nice!
- Did it look cool when I did it?

1813
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:44,430
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

1814
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:48,559
How you guys doing back there, huh?

1815
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:50,102
God, I love high school!

1816
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:51,437
Best prom night ever!

1817
01:34:57,151 --> 01:34:58,778
- Shoot them!
- Stay on them!

1818
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,613
I'm on them! I'm on them!

1819
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:03,240
Oh, good, you guys,
come hang out with me back here.

1820
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:05,743
- Oh, fuck, dude. Lisa, what are you doing?
- Did she pass out back there?

1821
01:35:09,872 --> 01:35:12,166
Hey, you got a gun.
Why don't you shoot back there?

1822
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,751
Shoot that gun, shoot that gun!

1823
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:15,169
All right, one second!

1824
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:16,545
Just shoot someone, you bitch!

1825
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:20,299
Peek-a-boo!

1826
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:21,634
Give me my money!

1827
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:24,678
Fuck that! Fuck that! No! No!

1828
01:35:24,762 --> 01:35:27,390
I can't do this!
I'm supposed to go to Berkeley!

1829
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:29,975
I'm gonna get the party started!

1830
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,560
- I'm gonna get the party started!
- No! No! Lisa, no!

1831
01:35:31,644 --> 01:35:34,772
Hey, I'm living my dream
of standing in a limo!

1832
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:35,981
What?

1833
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,152
- You're killing my dream!
- Come in.

1834
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:41,362
- What? I'm trying to party.
- Down!

1835
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:42,655
Bitch!

1836
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:46,075
What? Fuck!

1837
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:47,493
I'll kill you!

1838
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:48,702
Kill you!

1839
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:51,580
- No!No!
- Stay where you are.

1840
01:35:51,789 --> 01:35:52,832
Go! Go, go!

1841
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:57,628
No! Stop!

1842
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:59,922
I'm not fucking kidding!
Look, I'm trying to shoot people!

1843
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,340
Will you stop! Just for two seconds!

1844
01:36:01,424 --> 01:36:03,259
You're really hot and you're really slutty
and it's awesome,

1845
01:36:03,342 --> 01:36:04,635
but I got to shoot people right now!

1846
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,137
You think I'm hot?

1847
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,445
I wanna... Oh, my God!

1848
01:36:23,446 --> 01:36:25,156
Wait, guys! Call me!

1849
01:36:25,239 --> 01:36:26,949
Let me know where you're ending up later.

1850
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:32,788
I'm almost out of ammo.

1851
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:33,998
We're fucked.

1852
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:36,041
Give me my money!

1853
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:37,710
I got an idea.

1854
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:39,503
- You still got those shotgun shells?
- Yeah.

1855
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:41,338
Pop Quiznos.

1856
01:36:41,839 --> 01:36:46,343
What do you get when lithium batteries
react to potassium nitrate?

1857
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,971
That would be a covalent bond, brother.

1858
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:51,557
That's when two atoms, they share electrons.

1859
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,642
You see, they both need
what the other one has.

1860
01:36:53,726 --> 01:36:55,186
That makes them stick together.

1861
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:56,520
Are you saying we're covalent bonds?

1862
01:36:57,146 --> 01:36:58,689
What? No.

1863
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,816
We're not atoms, dude.

1864
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:20,586
- What's this?
- Tequila?

1865
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:22,838
I don't know, it was supposed to explode.

1866
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:26,050
Oh, shit!

1867
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:32,431
Where'd you learn how to do that, man?

1868
01:37:32,515 --> 01:37:33,766
App chemistry, bitch.

1869
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:41,106
Come on, blondie.

1870
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:44,026
Molly!

1871
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,239
Drop your weapon!

1872
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:49,949
Don't you fuckin' pull that arm up.

1873
01:37:50,241 --> 01:37:51,325
Don't.

1874
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:55,037
Looks like you're out of ammo, asshole!

1875
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:56,372
Come on! Get out here!

1876
01:37:56,455 --> 01:37:58,165
- What? What's going on?
- All right.

1877
01:37:58,249 --> 01:38:01,460
All right, here's the deal.
Nobody moves, or she's gonna get hurt.

1878
01:38:01,544 --> 01:38:03,879
Do you understand? Nobody move!

1879
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:05,756
- All right.
- Eric, help me.

1880
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:07,883
Don't you have a gun?

1881
01:38:08,926 --> 01:38:10,219
All right, don't move!

1882
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:13,305
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- No!

1883
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,641
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Hey, no, no, I said don't move!

1884
01:38:19,603 --> 01:38:22,064
- Oh, fuck, you shot him!
- Oh, God!

1885
01:38:22,147 --> 01:38:23,274
Are you okay?

1886
01:38:23,357 --> 01:38:24,984
You shot my partner, you motherfucker!

1887
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,152
I didn't mean to shoot you!
I meant to shoot him!

1888
01:38:27,278 --> 01:38:30,197
Are you alive, buddy? You okay?
You took a bullet for me, man.

1889
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:32,700
Yeah, I'm feeling a little ambivalent
about that right now.

1890
01:38:32,783 --> 01:38:35,869
Didn't you hear me? I said don't move!
I said that! You heard, right?

1891
01:38:35,953 --> 01:38:37,079
Eric, you heard me!

1892
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:38,497
- I said don't move!
- Eric, help me!

1893
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:40,040
- You got this.
- Hey, hold still.

1894
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,340
Freeze!

1895
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:49,675
Shoot!

1896
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:53,762
Come on.

1897
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,391
You peaked in high school, motherfucker.

1898
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:00,894
Oh, shit.

1899
01:39:01,145 --> 01:39:02,187
I shot him in the dick.

1900
01:39:02,271 --> 01:39:04,690
You shot me in the dick!

1901
01:39:04,815 --> 01:39:05,941
Oh, my God!

1902
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:07,151
Yes!

1903
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:09,111
Yes! Yes!

1904
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,362
Yes!

1905
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:12,364
You are under arrest!

1906
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:15,951
- It definitely came out my asshole!
- You have the right to remain silent!

1907
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:19,121
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1908
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,289
in a court of law!

1909
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:21,874
You have the right to an attorney!

1910
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:25,419
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you!

1911
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:28,547
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

1912
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:30,424
Fuck you! Bitch!

1913
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:32,217
Yes! Yes!

1914
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:34,136
We did it, man!

1915
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:35,304
We did it.

1916
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:36,555
God, I feel so good.

1917
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:38,057
We did it, man!

1918
01:39:38,891 --> 01:39:40,559
You're a goddamn rock star.

1919
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:43,354
Do you feel that?

1920
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,438
God damn, you're so cool.

1921
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:46,315
You just shot him in the dick.

1922
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:48,942
I've never seen that. Who does that?

1923
01:39:49,735 --> 01:39:51,403
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.

1924
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:53,947
I know I didn't say you were,
but you're smart.

1925
01:39:54,073 --> 01:39:56,659
You're a smart guy, and you're thoughtful,

1926
01:39:56,742 --> 01:40:00,954
and you're sincere and you're sweet
and you're loyal...

1927
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:03,791
And I fuckin' cherish you.

1928
01:40:06,752 --> 01:40:07,753
Should we high-five?

1929
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:15,344
My hand!

1930
01:40:16,637 --> 01:40:18,347
Are you all right?
Should we get you to the hospital, man?

1931
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,265
- Yeah, I think we need to call somebody.
- Hey, call somebody!

1932
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:22,351
I got to get my dick sewn back on.

1933
01:40:22,434 --> 01:40:23,977
- You shut the fuck up.
- Hey, you shut up.

1934
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:25,771
- That's not funny.
- Is that it?

1935
01:40:26,021 --> 01:40:27,147
What?

1936
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:30,067
That's my dick!

1937
01:40:30,776 --> 01:40:31,819
Pick up my dick! Please!

1938
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:33,195
No, we're not picking up your dick.

1939
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,697
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

1940
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:38,992
Oh, fuck!

1941
01:40:44,498 --> 01:40:45,666
He's my friend.

1942
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,627
They don't serve vegan in jail, bitch.

1943
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,511
Hey.

1944
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:00,472
Molly...

1945
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:02,891
I'm really sorry.

1946
01:41:04,143 --> 01:41:07,813
I know you wanted a guy to trust,
and I wanted to be that person so badly.

1947
01:41:08,856 --> 01:41:10,983
And I let you down in a lot of ways.

1948
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,818
And...

1949
01:41:15,195 --> 01:41:16,864
It's good that you're mad at me.

1950
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:20,200
I think it's good.
I think you should be mad at more guys,

1951
01:41:20,284 --> 01:41:25,330
because you deserve a guy who's good
and who doesn't lie to you.

1952
01:41:25,664 --> 01:41:28,167
And you should never settle
for less than that.

1953
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,461
There are good guys out there

1954
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:34,006
who aren't assholes like me.

1955
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:38,594
Thanks for saving my life,

1956
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:40,429
asshole.

1957
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:45,017
Put her there, partner.

1958
01:41:58,363 --> 01:41:59,990
I'll come back later.

1959
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:07,915
We're, like, in the end of Die Hard right now,
but it's our actual life.

1960
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,291
It's crazy.

1961
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:11,710
- Number one or two?
- Three.

1962
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:14,379
- Sam Jackson one. Yeah!
- Sam Jackson style.

1963
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:19,176
Boom, motherfuckers!
What's going on? Come on!

1964
01:42:24,014 --> 01:42:25,557
Where is he? There's my guy!

1965
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:28,018
There he is! That's him. That's him.

1966
01:42:28,393 --> 01:42:29,394
- Enough.
- Too long on the hug.

1967
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:33,690
Congratulations, you crazy,
sick, vigilante motherfuckers.

1968
01:42:33,774 --> 01:42:35,526
You got your first arrest, huh?

1969
01:42:36,527 --> 01:42:38,487
- Look. Got something made for you.
- You didn't!

1970
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,781
- Come on. All right, all right.
- Enough. Enough.

1971
01:42:40,948 --> 01:42:42,241
New assignment.

1972
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:45,369
Since you two cowboys love to drink booze,

1973
01:42:45,619 --> 01:42:49,665
smoke weed with kids, and fuck
anything with a big ass in jeans

1974
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:51,083
with low self-esteem,

1975
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:55,128
I'm gonna send you to a place
where all that shit is allowed.

1976
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:56,421
Oh, I love Disneyland!

1977
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:59,842
You two sons of bitches
are going to college!

1978
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:01,552
'Yes!
- No!

1979
01:43:42,801 --> 01:43:43,802
Boo-yah!

1980
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:22,674
Oh, my God!
You're like two Hardy Boys in one!

1981
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:38,523
Oh, fuck!

1982
01:46:28,175 --> 01:46:29,426
<i>Hey, why are you here, Scott?</i>

1983
01:46:29,509 --> 01:46:31,970
<i>What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?</i>
