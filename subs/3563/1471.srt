191
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,804
这套"让新人证明自己"的狗屁
This shit. This "Let's make the new guy prove himself" bullshit.

192
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,008
我早就听过 我可不吃这一套
I gotta tell you. I've heard it before and it gets old real fast.

193

I'm not trying to take anything from anybody.

197
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,818
不管你怎么说
As reassuring as that is.

198
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,280
大部分人的看法就是这样
a lot of guys don't see it that way.

199
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,980
我到了 马上就会进去
I'm here. I'm walking in right now.

202
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,813
这是怎么发生的?
How the hell did this happen?

203
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,030
车就这样跑掉了
It just got away from me.

204
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,070
车就这样跑掉了?
It got away from you?

205
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,034
那是火车 不是宠物

212
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,260
我有设定独立刹车 它迟早会停
I set the independent brakes. That'll for sure stop it.

213
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,588
速度有多快?
How fast is it going?

一小时不超过十哩
No more than 1 0 miles per.

220
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,281
请他们 马上进侧线
they need to get into the nearest siding.

221
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,195

so friction should stop the damn thing after a few miles.

236
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,077
我们要通知所有主线北行的列车
Still. we need to alert every northbound train on the mainline.

237
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,163
20哩范围内的列车优先
First 20 miles of track take priority.

238
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,668
不管你说的

是在维修轨道整修火车

A coaster? Really?

252
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,197

Yeah. It should roll past MP 5 in about 1 5 minutes.

253
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,870
你有足够的时间切换轨道
That should give you enough time to throw the switch.

254
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,577
让它离开主线进入侧线

你要我爬上车停下它?
You want me to climb onboard and stop it?

256
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,920
不用 有两个工作人员过去了 你只要切换轨道就好

辣妹参厅? 你知道吗? 好
Hooters. You know? All right.

283
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,556
别怀疑 就是辣妹参厅 把脸上那个奇怪笑容收起来
That's right. Hooters. Wipe that grin off your face.

284
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,226
- 我很喜欢那个地方 - 当然
- I'm a fan. - Yeah.

285
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,310
你脸都红了
You're blushing.

286
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,362
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

287
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,073
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

291

听说你有滑行车 真的吗?
Did I hear right? You've got a coaster?

292
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,597
偶发事件 我们在处理了
Yeah. This sort of thing happens. We're on it.

293
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,553
停的下来吗?
Won't it trip a relay?

294
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,269
听着 我要直接跟盖文先生报告
Listen. I need to speak to Mr. Galvin directly.

295
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,728
我了解 可以请他回电吗?
I see. Can you have him call me. then?

296
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,322
不 我正要看货物清单
No. I'm about to review the cargo shipment myself.

297
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,530

请帮我联络寄货人
Get a hold of the shipper. please.

312
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,172
开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

313
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,396
火车呢?
Where's the train?

314
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,065
你说火车在哪里?
Where does it look like the goddamn train is?

315
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,650
我不知道 你在这里干什么?
It's not here! What are you doing out here?

316
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,853
我有可能把火车藏在口袋里吗?
Do I look like I got a train hidden in my back pocket?

317
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,107
邦尼 帮我接给康妮 我是奈德
Bunny. get me Connie. It's Ned.

318
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,446
到后面去 SB
Get behind us. jackass.

319
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,148
- 你太慢到了 - 少来这一套
- Did you get here too late? - Don't give me that shit.

320
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,450
你们两个白痴老把事情搞砸
You two numbnuts are always screwing up.

321
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,449
你调换轨道了吗?
You switched the track that was supposed to get the train on the right track.

322
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,910
康妮 我是奈德
Connie. Yeah. it's Ned.

323
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,287
你把开关弄好没?
Did you throw that switch yet?

324
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:36,872
6分钟前就弄好了 但没看到火车
Yeah. six minutes ago. but your train. it's not here.

325
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,083
我以为车速比你想的慢
I thought it might be going a little slower than you guessed,

326
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:40,759
但你派来的两个白痴刚出现
but these two numbnuts that you sent.

327
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:42,086
他们也没看到
they just showed up and they ain't seen it. either.

328
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,842
你是说火车已经过去了?
Are you saying our train's already passed?

329
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,514
我想是这样
Yes. ma'am. That'd be my guess.

330
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,133
它不是滑行车 火车有动力
It's not a coaster. That train's under power.

331
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:49,388
我也是这么认为
That'd be my guess. too.

332
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:52,138
- 叫杜伊接电话 - 好的
- Put Dewey on the phone. - Sure.

333
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,642
她要跟你说话 浑蛋
She wants to talk to you. asshole.

334
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,141
好的
Yeah.

335
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,521
我要你用力地想
I need you to rally every cell in that brain of yours.

336
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:58,819
你设定独立刹车的时候
When you applied the independent.

337
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:01,113
油门在前进的状态吗?
was the throttle in the forward position?

338
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,940
没错 我要让它移动!
Yeah. I had to get it moving!

339
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,447
油门放在什么位置?
In what position was the throttle set?

340
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,529
该死 在什么位置?
Damn it. Dewey. what position?

341
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,625
油门在第八格全速前进
Connie. the throttle was in notch 8. full power.

342
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,873
它拖了39节车!
Okay? It was 39 cars!

343
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:22,292
好
Okay.

344
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,674
往南跟上去
Take the southbound track. Catch up.

345
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:27,381
看你们能不能爬上去
See if it's still going slow enough for one of you to climb on.

346
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:31,640
你要等到13号哩程标轨道才会分开
You have got until milepost 1 3 before the track splits.

347
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,015
让我跟奈德说话
Let me talk to Ned again.

348
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,813
做得好 浑蛋!
Nice job. asshole!

349
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:44,482
奈德 我要你回到车上跟着主线 明白吗?
Ned. I want you to get back in your car and follow the mainline. Okay?

350
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:45,861
我要你盯住列车
I want a set of eyes on that train.

351
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:47,739
没问题 了解
You got them. Roger that.

352
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:00,623
我听不到!
I can't hear you!

353
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,546
铁路安全非常重要!
Railroad Safety Campaign!

354
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:51,135
宾州南部锌工厂

355
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,443
没问题
You're good.

356
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:06,939
还有50尺
Keep it coming. 50.

357
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:10,735
20尺
20 feet.

358
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:12,406
减速
Slow down.

359
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,491
搞定了
All right. you're good.

360
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,306
杰西 怎么了?
Yeah. What's going on?

361
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,217
可以讲话吗?
You got a minute?

362
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,265
他不是说状况很好?
I thought he said it was looking good.

363
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:43,559
他本来这么想
That's what he thought.

364
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,145
但是遇上的法官非常难搞
Turns out the judge they assigned was a real hard- ass.

365
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,776
别开玩笑了
You gotta be kidding me.

366
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,483
保护令又被延长了30天
Look. the restraining order is being continued for another 30 days.

367
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:53,785
30天? 我该怎么办?
Thirty days? What am I supposed to do for 30 days?

368
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,203
不能接近孩子?
Stay away from my kid?

369
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,326
还会有一个听证会
And then there's another hearing after that. I guess.

370
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:01,872
威尔 怎么这么慢?
What's taking you so long. Will?

371
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,457
你打电话给那个律师
You call that lawyer. you can tell him

372
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:04,914
叫他去死 我得做事了
he can stick it up his ass. I got to go.

373
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:06,373
威尔 拿起无线电
Will, pick up the radio.

374
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:10,089
威尔 拿起无线电 完毕
Will. pick up the radio. Over.

375
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,470
你在吗?
Are you there?

376
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:13,547
在
Yeah.

377
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,554
别再讲电话了 放开手刹车
Yeah. Get off the phone. knock off the hand brakes.

378
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,852
快上来 该走了 还有活要干
get up here. It's time to go. We got work to do.

379
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,019
收到
Copy.

380
00:25:32,452 --> 00:25:33,532
确定有动力
No. it's definitely under power.

381
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,076
但车速还不确定
We're not sure of the exact speed yet.

382
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:38,030
这些车不是都有紧急刹车装置?
I thought all these trains had some sort of dead- man brake.

383
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,286
但要靠人力启动
There's a wand the engineer has to hit periodically

384
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:41,992
不然还能靠空气刹车
or the air brakes are automatically applied.

385
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,624
不幸的是 空气刹车没有连接
Unfortunately. this train's air brakes were disconnected.

386
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:48,381
我很乐意解释火车头基本操作
Sir, I would gladly explain the particulars of locomotive operation to you

387
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:51,426
如果有足够的时间 但现在我需要您的协助
if we had time. but right now I really need your assistance

388
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,424
派遣警员到所有主线上的平交道
posting officers at all the mainline crossings.

389
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:54,504
一个问题
One question.

390
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,095
你们打算如何让车停下来?
How do you all plan to stop it?

391
00:25:58,562 --> 00:25:59,847
我们还在想办法
We're working on it.

392
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,764
快快 前面又要分轨了!
Go. go. go! The split's coming up!

393
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,108
你确定上的去?
Are you sure you can do this?

394
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:15,818
开到驾驶厢旁就对了
Just get alongside of the cab.

395
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:23,534
开到驾驶厢旁边!
Get up alongside of it!

396
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,709
我在努力了!
I'm trying!

397
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,165
快点!
Go. go. go!

398
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,005
记住 我们没剩多少轨道了!
Remember. we don't have a lot of track!

399
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,892
可以了 快上去!
You got it. go. go!

400
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,104
杜伊!
Dewey!

401
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,144
太快了 慢一点!
It's too fast! Back it up!

402
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,689
杜伊 慢一点!
Come on. Dewey! Go back!

403
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:05,124
葛利 快上去!
Jump. Gilleece! Do it!

404
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:06,998
快回车里 小心!
Get in! Watch out!

405
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,004
这下我们该怎么办?
So now what the hell do we do?

406
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,892
我们该挂多少节车厢?
How many cars are we supposed to cut in?

407
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:34,612
20节 怎么了?
Twenty. Why?

408
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,065
20节 好
Twenty cars. okay.

409
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,237
有看到前面的开关标志吗?
See the switch stand up ahead of us?

410
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,618
开关标志?
The switch stand. yeah? Uh- huh.

411
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:43,910
看后视镜 看到后面那个了吗?
Take a look in the rear view mirror. You see the one behind us?

412
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:46,037
最后面那边 看到了吗?
Way back there. You see it? Uh- huh.

413
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:49,291
两个标志间刚好是21节的距离
There's exactly 21 cars between the two stands.

414
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,496
别问我怎么知道的
Don't ask me how I know.

415
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:52,543
那么为什么
So why is it that

416
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:55,626
还有4节半的车厢在距离外?
there's still more than four and a half cars that are yet to clear?

417
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,383
因为我...
Because I...

418
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,805
你说什么?
Excuse me?

419
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,678
- 因为我... - 因为什么?
- Because I cut... - Because what?

420
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,134
因为我挂了太多车厢
I cut in too many cars.

421
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,844
挂了太多车厢?
Cut in too many cars. huh?

422
00:28:06,273 --> 00:28:08,138
如果不是你一直找我麻烦
Maybe if you weren't on my ass the whole time.

423
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,349
我就能好好思考做好工作
I might be able to think straight and do my job.

424
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:11,399
你什么意思 "也许 假如我..."
What do you mean. "Maybe. if I..."

425
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:13,393
你把事情推到我身上?
You been on my ass this whole trip! You're blaming it on me?

426
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:14,978
我只是说 找一个工作!
I'm just saying. pick a goddamn job!

427
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:16,483
我有工作了! 二选一!
I got my job! You pick one!

428
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,657
弄油门或者是插销! 二选一!
I pull the throttle. you pull the pin! It's one or the other!

429
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,109
你去弄插销 你多了五个插销
You're five pins too many.

430
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:22,114
弄好插销 你说的对
Pull the pins. You're right. pull the pins.

431
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:23,911
我有通过训练!
I've had my training! All right?

432
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,661
但这是实际上阵 不是训练
Yeah. but we're out here in the real world. This ain't training.

433
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,494
训练不合格 顶多被当掉 这里玩真的 没搞好你就没命
In training. they just give you an F. Out here. you get killed.

434
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,169
- 我错了 好吗? - 你的确错了
- I screwed up. okay? - Yes. you did.

435
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:32,746
停车 后退 我把空车拿掉
Stop and roll back and I'll cut the empties.

436
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:33,830
后退?
Roll back?

437
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:36,917
天啊
Oh. Lord.

438
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,756
我们在主线上不能停车
We can't stop out here on the main.

439
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,129
已经离开一哩了
We're more than a mile out on the main.

440
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:41,508
离下一站还有一哩多
more than a mile to the next stop.

441
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,763
这样的长度距离不能后退
You don't take a consist this size that distance in reverse.

442
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,892
好 那我们到一个侧线再倒转
Fine. Then we'll make the turn at the next siding.

443
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,224
下一个侧线还有十哩远
The next siding's not for 1 0 miles.

444
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,310
那样会迟到 我不想迟到
We do that. we're late. I don't run late.

445
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,860
记录下来就好
Just green- sheet it and we'll move on.

446
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,313
算了 做纪录就会害到我!
Come on. We green- sheet it and it's my ass! Cut me some slack.

447
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:00,444
什么意思 害到你? 你姓考森耶
What do you mean. it's your ass? You're a Colson.

448
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:01,615
那是什么意思?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

449
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,534
意思是 你叔叔会帮你
That means you can call your uncle and they'll take care of it.

450
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:04,702
你是因为这样找我麻烦吗?
Is that what this is about?

451
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,870
不是 是因为多了5节车厢
No. it's about the five cars too many.

452
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:08,243
那我们就停车 后退 放掉多的车厢!
We're gonna stop. roll back and cut those empties!

453
00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:10,997
这是你的车头 但列车是我的
This may be your engine. but it's my goddamn train.

454
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:12,915
- 这是你的列车没错 - 我才是列车长!
- Yes. it is. - I'm the goddamn conductor!

455
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,584
- 没错 - 呼叫1206列车
- That's true. - 1206, check in.

456
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,380
我要打你的小报告
I'll write you up and green- sheet your ass.

457
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:17,457
- 满意了? - 这样如何?
- Will you? - How about that?

458

459
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,712
- 什么东西这么好笑 - 没事
- Something's funny? - No.

460
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:24,639
那你他妈的在笑什么? 那你在笑什么?
What the hell are you laughing at? What are you laughing at?

461
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,134
因为很有趣 你是个有趣的人
Because it's funny. You're a funny guy.

Well- trained. but funny. Yeah. this is 1 206.

富勒有一辆无人列车正在北行中
There's an unmanned train out of Fuller, on the northbound track. Over.

470

471
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:50,661
滑行车?
A coaster?

472
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:51,867
我们没有进一步的消息
1 206. we don't have all the details yet.

车上无人控制
and no one was onboard.

486
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,913
最新当地消息
Live, local, late- breaking.

487
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,878
消息指出驾驶操控判断错误
The engineer, they say, made an error in controlling the train.

488
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,500
离开车厢前
Before leaving the locomotive,

489
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,708
他想启动独立刹车
he intended to apply the independent brakes.

490
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,713
等他发现错误时
And then by the time he realized his mistake,

491
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:45,553
列车速度已经太快无法再上车
the train was going too fast for him to climb back on.

492
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,381
据铁路管理局
We're being told now by a spokesperson

493
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,049
官方发言人表示

494
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:51,806
驾驶须承担所有责任
that this employee will be held accountable.

495
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,195
- 康妮? - 在

498
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:15,078
见鬼 这怎么可能发生?
God damn it. How could this happen?

499
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,493
宾州匹兹堡AwvR总部

500
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:19,463
这是人为错误与衰运的组合
It's an unfortunate combination of human error and bad luck.

501
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,664
运气?
Luck?

502
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,091
我当过调度场主管十年
I was a yardmaster for 1 0 years. Ms. Hooper.

503
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:25,043
运气在火车这一行不该存在
Luck has no business in a rail yard.

504
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,133
载货物有需要担心的吗?
What are we worried about in terms of cargo?

505
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,256
当然 油料需要担心
Well. obviously. the diesel fuel's a concern.

506
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,095
不 我在问货物
No, I said cargo.

507
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,850
7到10号
Okay. well. cars 7 through 1 0

508
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:36,101
16到19号列车 载运了化学原料液态酚
and 1 6 through 1 9 are carrying a chemical called molten phenol.

509
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,102
我们还在联系寄货人
We're still trying to connect with the shipper

510
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:39,683
了解它的用途
to determine exactly what that is.

511
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:41,484
那是用来生产黏剂的
It's used in the manufacture of glue.

512
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:43,277
能请你等一下吗?
Can you hold on one moment?

513
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,397
你懂液态酚的用途?
You know about molten phenol?

514
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:46,774
对
Yes.

515
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,446
盖文先生 现场有一位联邦铁路局的代表
Mr. Galvin. we have an FRA inspector here.

516
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,156
我可以用扩音吗?
May I put you on speaker?

517
00:31:57,295 --> 00:32:00,787
我是第二区安全检查员史考特华纳 有什么可以帮忙?
Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector Scott Werner. How can I help?

518
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:03,214
快告诉我这玩意的用途
Just tell me what you know about molten phenol.

519
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:08,136
它是危险物质 毒性很强 非常易燃
Well. it's serious stuff. Very toxic. highly combustible.

520
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:09,679
太好了
Oh, that's terrific.

521
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,427
胡波 请联络州警
Hooper. get state police back on the line.

522
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,304
请他们派遣危险物质处理小组
Make sure they got a HazMat team briefed and ready.

523
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,345
派直升机跟紧777
And ask them to put a spotter chopper over 777.

524
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,434
你应该已经清除线上的列车?
I take it you've sided all rail traffic?

525
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,356
我们的都通知了 布鲁斯特那边会通知他们的列车
On our end, yes. Brewster's notifying its own.

526
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,975
长官
Sir.

527
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,727
我们该怎么处理?
how are we going to handle this?

528
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:25,403
列车会经过...
I mean. this train is en route to pass

529
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,321
人口密集的区域
through some highly populated areas.

530
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:30,776
我们两分钟后会开应变电话会议
We're having a strategy call in about two minutes.

531
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,694
我会准备好
All right. I'll be ready.

532
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,529
你不需要参加会议 胡波
You won't be on the call. Ms. Hooper.

533
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,498
- 什么? - 结论会通知你
- Excuse me? - You'll be advised.

534
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,834
你的当务之急是协调当地各单位
For now. coordinate with local authorities.

535
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:42,705
有超过一百个平交道需要控管
God knows we gotta have over 1 00 crossings that need to be secured.

536
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,839
共173个
One hundred and seventy- three.

537
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,841
平交道
Railroad crossings.

538
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,674
从这里到布鲁斯特分站
Between here and AWVR substation in Brewster.

539
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,472
听着 盖文先生
Listen. Mr. Galvin.

540
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:58,562
这列车的长度半哩
this train is half a mile long and is traveling at speed into population

541
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:01,014
载运八节有毒物质和五千加仑柴油
with eight freight cars of hazardous chemicals

542
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,270
加速前往人口密集区域
and 5, 000 gallons of diesel fuel.

543
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,693
这不是一般的列车
Sir, we're not just talking about a train here.

544
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,819
这是有如101大楼般的巨大飞弹
We're talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler Building.

545
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:11,532
你想讲什么?
So. what is your point. Ms. Hooper?

546
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,736
一旦它通过芬德雷
My point is after it crosses through Findlay.

547
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:16,113
会经过12哩的农地
there's about 1 2 miles of vacant farmland.

548
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:19,540
但之后一路到斯坦顿
but after that. it's nothing but town after town

549
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:20,617
全都是住宅区
all the way to Stanton.

550
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:22,248
我们手上的时间不多
We have a very limited window here.

551
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,462
你建议让它脱轨吗?
So. what are you suggesting we do. derail it?

552
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,460
是的
Yes. sir. I am.

553
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,467
趁我们还有机会的时候
While we still can.

554
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:38,803
我知道这样成本很大...
Mr. Galvin. I understand that's gonna cost the company a lot of money...

555
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:40,307
你知道多少吗?
Do you think?

556
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:43,974
我们不可能摧毁自己的列车
Ms. Hooper. we're not gonna intentionally destroy one of our own trains.

557
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,900
我们还有机会让列车停止
Not when we can still stop it.

558
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:47,561
这样可以避免...
We can avoid a lot of collateral...

559
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:49,396
我就当你刚才的建议是出于好心
I'm going to extend you my last ounce of good will

560
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,607
我会当做这段对话没有发生过
and pretend this conversation never happened.

561
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:58,283
他以为我怕我保不住饭碗
He thinks I'm worried about my job.

562
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,867
宾州北部芬德雷

563
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:08,461
请留在车内
Ma'am. please stay in your van.

564
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,921
- 来吧 - 请回到车上
- Come on. - Please get back into the van.

565
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,632
谁能告诉我发生什么事了?
Can you please tell us what's going on?

566
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:14,337
20哩内的所有平交道都封锁了
Every crossing's closed off for 20 miles.

567
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,922
夫人 为了你的安全 请回到车上
Ma'am. for your safety. please get back into your van.

568
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:17,174
我不回去
I'm not getting back in the vehicle.

569
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:18,348
我们要知道发生什么事
We need to know what's going on.

570
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,074
快点离开 列车来了
Guys. get out of there. There's a train coming.

571
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,329
快点!
Hurry!

572
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,373
快点 列车来了!
Hurry! It's coming!

573
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:50,130
该走了
Come on. We got to go.

574
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:52,129
让开 列车来了 快点!
Get out of there! Move it!

575
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:00,346
闪开!
Get out of the way!

576
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,849
1206呼叫中心
1 206 to dispatch. Over.

577
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:48,105
- 怎么了? - 怎么了?
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

578
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,854
我们没办法进去那个侧线
We're not gonna fit in that siding. that's what's wrong.

579
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,775
1206呼叫中心
1 206 to dispatch. Over.

580
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,861
1206 你进侧线了没?
1 206. are you in the siding yet?

581
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:55,483
你的位置在哪里?
What's your location?

582
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,449
不 还没 我们进不去
No, we're not in the hole. We're not gonna make it, can't do it.

583
00:35:58,703 --> 00:35:59,818
太多车厢了
Too much train.

584
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:01,574
我需要你更换轨道
I'm gonna need you to realign the switch

585
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,245
让我们前往下一个侧线
so we can proceed to the next siding.

586
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,449
1206 你需要马上离开主线
1 206. you have to get off the main. Over.

587
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:07,625
我了解 但你也要了解
I understand that. but you gotta understand this.

588
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:08,747
我们进不去
we're not going to fit.

589
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,245
1206 稍等
1206, stand by.

590
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,377
那个侧线有3千尺长
That siding's a good 3.000 feet. end to end.

591
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,795
时刻表上面
Check your timetable.

592
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:17,798
写的是4111尺
it's gonna tell you the siding is 4111 feet.

593
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,550
但那是两边号志间的总长
But that's signal to signal.

594
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:22,678
实际上大约是2500尺
In reality. it's more like 2.500 feet.

595
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,725
加上你多挂的五节车厢...
You add those five cars that you picked up...

596
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:25,893
可以进去
We can fit.

597
00:36:26,022 --> 00:36:27,102
不 进不去
No, we won't fit.

598
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,722
1206呼叫中心
Dispatch. this is 1 206.

599
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:31,479
请告知最近的维修轨道位置
Can you tell me where the nearest rip track is?

600
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,777
6.2哩后有一个 你的速度多快?
1 206. there's one in 6.2 miles. How fast are you going?

601
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:36,816
551里
55 miles an hour.

602
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,318
开快一点
1 206. go faster. Over.

603
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:40,525
为什么 那台滑行车还在线上?
Why? Is that coaster still on the main?

604
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:44,826
1206 777不是滑行车 重复 不是滑行车
1206, 777 is not a coaster. I repeat, it is not a coaster. Over.

605
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,581
你是说它有动力?
You're telling me it's under power?

606
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,583
我们需要 马上进侧线
Get in the goddamn siding.

607
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:53,083
1206 稍等
1206, stand by.

608
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:01,221
1206 如果你要尝试 维修轨道是空的
1 206. if you're going for it. that rip track is confirmed vacant.

609
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,009
你决定 法兰克
It's your call, Frank.

610
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,762
如果你要继续下去 需要更改轨道
We need to throw the switch if you're staying on.

611
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,427
不继续 就拉刹车
We're not staying on! Pull the brake. Frank.

612
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:08,728
拉刹车进侧线就会出乱子
We pull the brake and side up. I crash.

613
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:09,975
我是老法师了
I know what the hell I'm doing.

614
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:12,148
- 胡扯 你会害死我们! - 嘿
- Bullshit! You're gonna get us killed. - Hey!

615
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:14,768
1206 我需要答案
1206, I need an answer. Over.

616
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,195
请切换轨道
Realign the switch.

617
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,943
完毕
Over.

618
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,840
当时里面没有人 就开走了
The train was just going with no one in it. Just took off.

619
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:43,221
我们说列车会经过这里
We were yelling on the radio earlier,

620
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,548
列车要来了
there's a runaway train coming through.

621
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,348
接下来会经过我们镇上
It could be coming to our town next

622
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,392
学校很接近铁路
and the high school's right next to those train tracks.

623
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,719
不久前
Just a few moments ago,

624
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:51,770
一辆失控列车高速经过...
a train came barreling down these tracks...

625
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,647
我们还在计算数字
We're still going over the numbers.

626
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:58,149
但如果777脱轨 就会造成极大灾难
but should 777 derail. we're looking at a major disaster.

627
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,480
任何一节危险车厢爆炸
If even one of those HazMat cars blew.

628
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,694
就可以夷平一个城镇
it could easily decimate an entire town.

629
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:04,655
列车上总共有八节危险车厢
That train is carrying eight of them.

630
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:07,112
能说说你看到的情况吗...
Can you please explain to our viewers what you witnessed...

631
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,249
环境和轨道赔偿加上列车损坏
Environmental liability. track damage. car and locomotive loss.

632
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:15,621
我们预估损失将超过1亿美金
We're looking at a projected cost easily over $1 00 million.

633
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:17,789
预估的股票跌幅呢?
And the resulting stock devaluation?

634
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:22,844
跌幅应该在三成到四成中间
Our projections indicate it could be in the 30 to 40% range.

635
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,676
我同意进行盖文的计划
I say we go with Mr. Galvin's option.

636
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,721
我已经联络好布鲁斯特分站
I've already prepped our substation in Brewster.

637
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:31,348
只需要命令就可以进行
They just need a go- ahead.

638
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,012
进行吧
You have it.

639
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,354
大家可以离开了
Okay. everybody out.

640
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:39,231
奥克曼留下
Hoffman. you stay here.

641
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:42,359
贝克 把富勒到斯坦顿间的轨道图给我
Baker. get me a track schematic. Fuller to Stanton. please.

642
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:57,833
我是欧文斯
This is Owens.

643
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,883
71哩 雷射枪显示时速70到71哩
7 1. 70. 7 1 on the gun.

644
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:05,965
红点的意思是?
So the red means?

645
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,797
777的路径
777 blew through a signal.

646
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,473
红点代表麻烦
Everything in red means trouble on the mainline.

647
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,925
红点也太多了吧
That's a lot of red.

648
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:12,927
康妮 盖文先生2线找
Connie, Mr. Galvin on line 2.

649
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:17,728
我是康妮胡波
This is Connie Hooper.

650
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:20,981
主线上的所有平交道都关闭了吗?
Have all the mainline crossings been closed?

651
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,196
是的 我请州警协助执行了
Yes, I've been coordinating with PSP.

652
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:24,773
我们有对应方式了吗?
Do we have a strategy in place?

653
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,365
已经在进行中
It's already underway.

654
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:33,536
宾州中部基丁峰

655
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:39,412
我后方的阵仗显示
By the activity level behind me,

656
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:42,590
他们正在尝试停下失控列车
it is evident that a plan to stop the runaway train is underway,

657
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:46,590
但目前铁路公司没有任何回应
but so far, no one at AWVR is commenting.

658
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:53,468
铁路公司员工雷恩史考特
We just witnessed A WVR employee Ryan Scott

659
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:55,394
登上其中一架救援直升机
boarding one of the rescue helicopters.

660
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:58,894
这位前陆战队员刚从阿富汗回国
He is a 22- year- old Marine vet who has just returned from Afghanistan.

661
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,232
- 这是怎么回事 - 我需要警察前导!
- What the hell is this? - I need a police escort now!

662
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:12,327
- 这上面说你是焊接工 - 焊接工主管
- It says here you're a welder. - Lead welder.

663
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,996
听着 老兄 我没有多少时间
Listen. buddy. I don't got a lot of time.

664
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:16,283
你们可以联络我主管 康妮胡波!
You can call my yardmaster. Connie Hooper!

665
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:23,797
- 康妮派你来的? - 没错
- Connie sent you? - That's what I said.

666
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:25,336
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

667
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:35,847
中心呼叫1206
1206, this is dispatch.

668
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:39,055
我们计算过了 你们的长度超过两千尺 进不去
1 206. we ran the math. At over 2.000. you wouldn't have fit.

669
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:41,307
你的决定是对的
Good call. Over.

670
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:45,361
谢谢 我需要知道那辆列车的位置
Thank you. but I need to know where that oncoming train is.

671
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:47,438
它距离我们多远?
How far away is it?

672
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,573
1206 我们不确定
1206, we're not exactly sure.

673
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,150
你们不确定? 快点弄清楚啊!
You're not sure? Well. find out!

674
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,658
我在宾州中部的高空...
I'm high above central Pennsylvania. This train got away...

675
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,961
警方封锁了
Emergency responders want to halt all activity near the line

676
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,879
铁路1哩内的区域
and possibly evacuate all homes

677
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,877
并考虑疏散其中的居民
within a mile radius of the tracks.

678
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,002
列车载有几千加仑的易燃油料
There's thousands of gallons of fuel onboard, which is highly flammable.

679
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:10,837
我们等候进一步消息
But we're still awaiting word on that.

680
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:21,689
这就是盖文的计划?
This is Galvin's strategy?

681
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,198
看来他们试图要用另一辆车档在777前
Looks like they're putting a train in front of 777

682
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:32,491
让它减速
in an attempt to slow it down.

683
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,909
接着派出直升机载雷恩过去
Now, they are sending a chopper with Ryan Scott

684
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,867
铁路公司仍然拒绝回应
and the railroad company is still refusing to comment.

685
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,883
我们刚刚得知有26年经验的机师杰德
We've just learned that 26- year rail company veteran Judd Stewart

686
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,384
驾驶着
is at the controls of the engine

687
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,935
前方的火车
that is in front of the runaway train.

688
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,124
我是康妮胡波
This is Connie Hooper from Fuller Yard.

689
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:27,751
你的人要从直升机下来吗?
Is this your guy coming off the helicopter?

690
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,518
目前速度55哩
Still holding at 55.

691
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:43,600
减速到40 继续刹车
Get her down to 40 and keep braking.

692
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,929
该死!
Shit!

693
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:37,358
做的好 继续减速
That's it. Keep going. Keep slowing.

694
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:39,694
到了40哩我们就派人下去
Get her down to 40 and we'll set our boy down.

695
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:54,966
真是令人无法相信!
Unbelievable!

696
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:56,673
一定要成功!
Do this!

697
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,007
快点
Come on.

698
00:43:58,224 --> 00:43:59,634
...太惊险了...
...incredibly dangerous...

699
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:15,192
杰德 加油!
Do this. Judd. come on!

700
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:27,078
低于40哩了 他上去了没?
I'm under 40. Is he on yet?

701
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:31,874
往下!
Now!

702
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,480
看来雷恩受伤了
Looks like Marine Ryan Scott has been injured.

703
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,562
没有成功 减速!
It's a no- go. Slow down!

704
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:59,110
继续减速 尽量让777离开主线
Just keep braking. Try to slow it. Try to get 777 off the main.

705
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,235
轨道已经切换
Switch has been thrown.

706
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:15,255
该死的东西 慢下来啊!
Slow down. God damn it!

707
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:22,589
不能切换到侧线 速度太快了
Don't side it yet! It's going too fast.

708
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:41,990
跳车!
Bail! Bail! Bail!

709
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,298
我的天啊!
Holy shit!

710
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:04,638
列车可能脱轨了
Maybe it derailed.

711
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:09,977
我无法形容刚刚有多夸张
Wow! I can't believe how crazy that was.

712
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:12,889
我的天啊 盖文 你这个混蛋!
Oh. my God! Galvin. you asshole!

713
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:41,584
富勒调度场 这是1206
Fuller Yard. Fuller Yard. This is 1 206.

714
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,171
我们正经过52号哩程标 在主线上往北前进
We're passing milepost 52. heading northbound on the Main 1.

715
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:46,847
1206 我在跟哪位说话
1 206. who am I speaking with?

716
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,515
法兰克巴恩 机师
Frank Barnes. the engineer.

717
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:50,513
我是康妮胡波 富勒主管
This is Connie Hooper. yardmaster at Fuller.

718
00:46:50,604 --> 00:46:52,720
为什么你还在主线上?
Why are you still on the mainline?

719
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:55,022
我们本要进入侧线但没成功
We were directed to a siding that's a no- go.

720
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:58,818
接下来要进入50号标志的维修轨道
We're heading to a rip track just past milepost 5- 0.

721
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:01,395
我需要知道你们列车的位置
We need to know the location of your yard's train.

722
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,324
它刚经过47号哩程标
It just passed milepost 47.

723
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:07,197
这下糟了
Holy shit.

724
00:47:15,504 --> 00:47:18,337
他们想让它进入侧线但失败了 导引车因此脱轨翻覆
They tried to side it. but it jumped the switch and derailed the lash- up.

725
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:20,755
导引车? 谁是驾驶?
Lash- up? Who was driving?

726
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:23,718
拥有26年资历的机师杰德史都华
The engineer, a 26- year rail company veteran,

727
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:27,137
在基丁峰丧生
was killed earlier today in Keating Summit, central Pennsylvania.

728
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:28,213
杰德史都华
Judd Stewart.

729
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,766
史都华?
Stewart?

730
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:32,719
你说史都华?
You said Stewart?

731
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,061
杰德史都华 来自布鲁斯特的机师
Judd Stewart. an engineer from Brewster.

732
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:41,936
你认识他?
You know him?

733
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:52,405
你车头有多少马力?
What's your power on the point?

734
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:56,125
5000匹 它没有很强
5.000 horses. She's not a hotshot.

735
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,999
但还算有力
but she's still got some life left in her. over.

736
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:02,248
让它好好表现 告诉盖文有两个公司的人在主线上
Give her all you got. Tell Galvin we got two guys out on the mainline

737
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:03,749
准备跟我们的车对撞
about to play chicken with our train.

738
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,225
- 我们试过但失败了 - 怎么了?
- We tried to stop it. We blew it. - What?

739
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:15,936
火车得被摧毁
That train's got to go down.

740
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,684
问题是要怎么减低损伤
The only question is how to minimize the damage.

741
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:18,764
大家安静!
Quiet!

742
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:21,441
我们刚得知有另一辆列车在轨道上
We just learned there is yet another train on this track,

743
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:23,690
正朝着失控列车过去
headed directly at the runaway.

744
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:25,609
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

745
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:29,238
我们竟然要看电视才知道?
We gotta learn about it on damn TV?

746
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:46,921
妮琪 听着 别挂电话
Nicole. Listen. don't hang up. Don't hang up.

747
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:48,377
爸 我正在忙
Dad. I'm busy. Okay?

748
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,803
我了解
Okay, I understand.

749
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,971
我只是想告诉你我爱你们而已
Dad? I just wanted to tell you I love you.

750
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,513
别肉麻了 爸 发生什么事?
that's all. Okay. fine! Dad. what's wrong?

751
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:56,844
没事 我只是...
Nothing. nothing. I just...

752
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,726
爸 怎么了?
Dad. what's wrong?

753
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,727
告诉你妹妹我爱你们 好吗? 我得挂了
Just tell your sister I love you both. okay? I got to go.

754
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,522
怎么了?
What's wrong?

755
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:20,784
1206 你们还好吗?
1 206. how are you holding up?

756
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:23,120
距离维修轨道还有半哩
About a half a mile from that rip track. Over.

757
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:26,048
你们随时会看到777的车头
Chances are you're going to see 777's nose any minute now.

758
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:27,170
了解
Affirmative.

759
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,476
为什么要刹车?
Why are you braking?

760
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:45,310
相信我 速度太快我们就会脱轨
Trust me. If we head in this hot. we'll tear right off the track.

761
00:49:47,656 --> 00:49:49,021
天啊
Oh. Jesus.

762
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:56,362
减速到40 小心碰撞
Get her down to 40 and brace yourself.

763
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,334
得想办法让十节车厢进入侧线
You need to get at least 1 0 cars into the siding.

764
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,592
太好了!
Yes!

765
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:50,083
法兰克 切换到六频道
Frank, go to 6. Frank, go to 6.

766
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:52,630
我在六频道 请说
Yeah. I'm at 6. Go.

767
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,920
他们要疏散阿克罗镇
They're evacuating Arklow.

768
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,930
他们要让列车脱轨
They're going to derail the train.

769
00:50:57,893 --> 00:50:58,848
他们要用什么?
What are they using?

770
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:00,927
标准脱轨设备
Standard DRE.

771
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:02,769
移动式脱轨装置
Yeah. a portable derailer.

772
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,317
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

773
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:12,021
那辆车最后一个连接器看来是开的
I got a look at that train's last coupler knuckle. it was open.

774
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,690
我们现在出发 我们回到主线上
We take off right now. we get back on the main.

775
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,366
就能倒退追上列车
we can chase it down in reverse.

776
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:17,693
追? 等等
Chase? Whoa. wait a minute.

777
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,495
要阻止这种动力只能抓住列车尾
The only way to stop that kind of power. grab it by the tail.

778
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:21,867
往反方向拉
boom. gun it in the opposite direction.

779
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:23,199
我们不能冒险 万一列车脱轨
We can't just chase it down. If it goes down.

780
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:24,703
我们就惨了
we're gonna be a wreck on a wreck.

781
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:29,288
不重要 列车应该不太可能会脱轨
Doesn't matter. There's a good chance the derailer won't work.

782
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,632
那东西都已经叫脱轨器了!
It's called a derailer. for Christ's sake!

783
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:33,209
它的作用就是让火车脱轨
That's what they do! A train that size

784
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:36,386
这么巨大又爆速的列车 只要被它撞到就会人问蒸发
going that fast. it will vaporize anything that gets in its way.

785
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:37,963
狗屁 没把握他们就不会用
Bullshit! They wouldn't use it if...

786
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:40,470
他们错了 好吗? 他们错了
They're wrong. all right? They're wrong.

787
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,430
你到底来不来?
Are you in or are you out?

788
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:44,557
你想找死就自己去
You want to get yourself killed. you do it alone.

789
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:46,809
问问你老婆看她怎么想
You know what? Ask your wife what she thinks.

790
00:51:47,443 --> 00:51:48,808
等一下!
Wait!

791
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,567
如果脱轨器没作用
If you're right and that derailer fails.

792
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:56,523
列车开到斯坦顿的机率有多大?
what are the odds it makes it to Stanton?

793
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:59,114
你刚刚有看到 你说呢?
You saw the train. What do you think?

794
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:27,680
1206 我是康妮胡波 你们在吗?
1 206. this is Connie Hooper. Are you there?

795
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,440
1206 请说
1 206. Over.

796
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,392
只是想问问你们的状况
Just wanted to see how you boys are doing.

797
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,449
现在时速大约60哩 康妮
We're doing about 60 mile an hour. Connie.

798
00:52:38,744 --> 00:52:41,406
什么? 法兰克 我不懂
Sorry? Frank. I don't understand.

799
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,529
我们要去追你的列车
We're going after your train.

800
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:45,580
1206 我不懂你意思
1206, I'm not hearing you.

801
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,157
车尾的连接器是开的
The rear knuckle was left open.

802
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:49,743
如果我们追得上 就可以接到我们的车头
so if we can catch up. we can tie it on to our locomotive.

803
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:51,374
让777慢下来
try and slow down 777.

804
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:52,625
法兰克 你不能这样
Frank. you can't.

805
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:53,831
我已经做了
We already are.

806
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:55,632
携带式脱轨器没有用的
Portable derailer's not gonna cut it. Connie.

807
00:52:56,261 --> 00:52:57,876
谁说要用脱轨器了?
Who said anything about a derailer?

808
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:01,134
调度场说要撤离阿克罗镇的居民
Dispatch. they said that they're evacuating Arklow.

809
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:02,305
猜都猜的到
Two plus two is four.

810
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,430
- 奈德打来 他说还在追踪... - 不
- It's Ned. He said he's still following... - No. No. No.

811
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:07,853
告诉他我会回电 马上打给盖文
Tell him I'll call him back. Get me Galvin. now.

812
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,728
车上有三万加仑的有毒物质
Frank. that train's carrying 30.000 gallons of toxic chemicals.

813
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,569
刚刚本来有机会的 但火车正开往人口稠密的地区
They had a window before. but that train's going into populated areas.

814
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:17,066
现在不能让它脱轨了
There's no way they'd derail it now.

815
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:20,736
你确定吗?
Are you sure about that?

816
00:53:22,538 --> 00:53:24,153
让我先打电话确定
Look. Iet me make some calls.

817
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:26,447
请打电话确定
Make some calls. Please.

818
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:37,590
你觉得他们能赶上吗?
What do you think? Do you think they can catch up?

819
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:40,881
有可能 但就算他们赶上了
Possibly. But even if they do.

820
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:44,465
他们要在一般速度快十倍下连结 还是反方向
we're talking about coupling at 1 0 times the normal speed. in reverse.

821
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:47,308
我以为你比较想让车脱轨
I thought you were in favor of derailment.

822
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:49,682
那时列车还在偏僻的地方
Yeah. when they were in the middle of nowhere. not now.

823
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:51,263
但现在列车要开到城镇里了!
It's just town after town out there!

824
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:53,098
盖文说要再打给你
Mr. Galvin says he'd have to call you back.

825
00:53:53,193 --> 00:53:55,275
我是康妮胡波 找盖文先生
This is Connie Hooper for Mr. Galvin.

826
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,602
他在开会
Mr. Galvin is in a meeting.

827
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,946
那么你来告诉我 公司决定要让777脱轨吗?
Then maybe you can tell me. Is the company planning on derailing 777?

828
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:02,524
之前我听说的是盖文死命反对
Last I heard. Galvin was dead set against it.

829
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:04,359
抱歉 恕我爱莫能助
I'm sorry, I'd really like to help you, Ms. Hooper.

830
00:54:04,454 --> 00:54:06,035
我没有办法代表公司回应
But I'm not at liberty to give you that information.

831
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:08,455
不 你当然无权这么做
No. of course you're not at liberty to.

832
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,453
法兰克说对了
Frank's right.

833
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:20,171
这种单引擎可以开多快?
What's the fastest you've taken a single engine like this?

834
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,086
- 没挂车厢吗? - 没错
- Unattached? - Yeah.

835
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,136
50到55哩
Fifty. 55.

836
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:26,468
那是往前进的话
Of course. I was going forward.

837
00:54:27,227 --> 00:54:28,433
1206 听到了吗?
1206, you there?

838
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,477
1206回话 完毕
This is 1 206. over.

839
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:31,891
法兰克 你说对了
Frank, you're right.

840
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:34,519
他们是要想让车脱轨
About the derailment.

841
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,566
他们预计在阿克罗镇外行动
They're planning an attempt outside of Arklow.

842
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,401
告诉他们不会成功
Tell them idiots it ain't gonna work.

843
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:43,239
携带式脱轨器没有用
That portable derailer. it's worthless.

844
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,692
她已经跟我们说过了
She already told us.

845
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:49,489
他是公司的营运副总我奥斯卡盖文
Frank. this is Oscar Galvin. VP of Operations.

846
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:52,325
他要求进入通话 把麦克风打开
patched in at his request. open mike.

847
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:57,170
对 我们要让777脱轨 法兰克 这是既成的决定
Yeah. we're derailing 777. Frank. It's a done decision.

848
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:59,748
不管你喜不喜欢 这是我们目前最好的选择
Like it or not, it's our best option at this stage.

849
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,175
在阿克罗镇脱轨的损害比较小
There'll be less collateral damage in Arklow.

850
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:03,964
我们已经撤离那里的居民
It's already being evacuated.

851
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:06,923
我们不能让777开到斯坦顿
and we can't let 777 make it to Stanton.

852
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:09,133
我无意冒犯
Look. Mr. Galvin. with all due respect.

853
00:55:09,227 --> 00:55:10,842
我在铁路已经工作了28年
I've been railroading 28 years.

854
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:14,179
我们很有机会让列车停下来
I'm telling you. we got a real chance to stop this thing.

855
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:15,684
我们已经试过了
No. we already tried.

856
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:19,189
那是从前面 我们要从后面拉住它
That was from the front. We're long hood lead back.

857
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:22,316
情况不同 我们比较能控制列车
It's a different situation. We got more control now.

858
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:27,693
如果我取消脱轨行动 而你失败了怎么办?
What if I cancel the derailer and you fail. Frank?

859
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:30,616
列车会以时速70哩
That train will be doing 70 miles an hour

860
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:32,789
冲向斯坦顿
into that elevated S- curve in Stanton.

861
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,662
损失会比现在多出百倍
The damage will be 1 00 times worse.

862
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:38,917
但我要说携带式脱轨器没有用
Right. I'm just telling you. the portable derailer is worthless.

863
00:55:39,383 --> 00:55:42,090
目前的车厢太多也开得太快
You got too much train traveling entirely too fast.

864
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:45,878
也许可以让1206支援
Maybe 1 206 should just stay on it as a backup.

865
00:55:46,014 --> 00:55:50,132
我不会让更多人员或财产受到危害
Look. I am not jeopardizing more personnel and more property

866
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:53,014
只因为有某个机师想逞英雄
just because some engineer wants to play hero.

867
00:55:53,105 --> 00:55:54,891
讨论到此结束!
End of discussion!

868
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:58,232
那辆列车是我们的财产 由我们做决定!
That train is our property. It's our decision!

869
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:02,611
你现在就停车 不然我就开除你!
Now you stop your pursuit or I will fire you!

870
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,322
你已经开除我了
Fire. You already did.

871
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,570
已经怎么样?
Already did what?

872
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,122
你已经开除我了
You've already fired me.

873
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:20,208
我已经收到90天的通知信了 就在72天前
I received my 90- day notice in the mail 72 days ago.

874
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,252
强制提早退休 红利减半
Forced early retirement. half benefits.

875
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:34,893
所以你只剩3个礼拜 却还是要为我们冒生命危险?
So you're going to risk your life for us with three weeks left.

876
00:56:36,648 --> 00:56:38,058
不是为了你们
Not for you.

877
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:41,186
我这么做不是为了你们
I'm not doing it for you.

878
00:56:42,784 --> 00:56:45,150
法兰克 把无线电给我
Frank. Let me see that thing.

879
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,282
盖文先生 我是列车长威尔考森
Mr. Galvin. this is Will Colson. your conductor.

880
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:58,209
我要告诉你 我们要追到列车
I'm letting you know. we're going to run this bitch down.

881
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:02,630
你没听到我刚刚说的吗 考森? 我会开除你!
Maybe you didn't hear what I just said. Colson. I will fire you!

882
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:08,424
真可惜 我才开始喜欢上这份工作呢
Well. that's too bad. I was just starting to like this job.

883
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:15,101
该死 你给我听着 你这混蛋 你会被开除的!
God damn it, you listen to me! You son of a bitch! You will be fired!

884
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:18,650
讯号不清楚...
You're breaking up. Sorry. you're...

885
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,283
- 别胡说了... - 长官 我想他们已经收不到了
- This garbage is... - Sir. I think they're gone.

886
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,781
现在他们是你的问题了 胡波
This is your headache now. Hooper.

887
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:36,209
你得让他们离开主线 不然你自己工作也不保!
Now you get them off the main or consider yourself shit- canned. too!

888
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,295
我喜欢他们
I like them.

889
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:41,964
让我看进入阿克罗镇的路线图
Bring up Beech Siding to Arklow.

890
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:45,423
各位可以看到大家正在紧急撤离
Take a look behind me, you can see emergency evacuation measures

891
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:48,051
这里是铁轨旁的小镇阿克罗
are currently in effect right here in the tiny town of Arklow.

892
00:57:54,064 --> 00:57:55,679
导引车失败
The lash- up was a no- go.

893
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:03,229
1206呼叫富勒调度场 康妮 你在吗?
1 206 to Fuller Yard. Connie. are you there? Over.

894
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:05,985
法兰克 我为盖文的态度道歉
Frank. I'm real sorry about Galvin.

895
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:07,907
没关系 他挂断了吗?
That's okay. Listen. Iisten. Is he off?

896
00:58:07,995 --> 00:58:09,030
对 他挂电话了
Yeah. he's gone.

897
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:10,702
听着
Okay. Iisten up.

898
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:12,279
我要你帮我们一个忙
I'm going to need you to do us a favor.

899
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:16,413
我需要你随时告诉我们777的速度与位置
I need you to keep us posted on the speed and location of 777.

900
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:18,118
位置和速度 完毕
Location and speed. Over.

901
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,046
康妮?
Connie?

902
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:26,172
777在阿克罗镇外9哩
Frank. 777's 9 miles out of Arklow.

903
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:27,503
你得快点赶上它
You got some catching up to do.

904
00:58:27,597 --> 00:58:28,928
阿克罗镇外9哩
9 miles out of Arklow.

905
00:58:44,614 --> 00:58:46,525
你说你老婆叫什么名字?
What did you say your wife's first name was?

906
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:47,651
达儿希
Darcy.

907
00:58:47,743 --> 00:58:49,779
你说来话长的故事是什么?
So. what was the long story you didn't want to make long?

908
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:54,534
2周前有天我回家
I come home from work two weeks ago

909
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:56,580
看到她在传简讯
and she's texting on the phone.

910
00:58:56,668 --> 00:58:59,330
我问她传给谁 她说不重要
I ask her who with. she says. "Nobody."

911
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:01,711
我要她给我看电话 她不要
I say. "Let me see the phone." She says no.

912
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:04,255
这件事发生了五、六次...
This goes on five or six times.

913
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,841
我没听懂 她传简讯...?
Wait. you're losing me. She's texting...

914
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:08,710
有个家伙是我们以前同学
There's this guy we both went to school with.

915
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:10,966
他现在是州警
He's a cop. he's a PA state trooper.

916
00:59:11,058 --> 00:59:13,720
他喜欢达儿希很久了
He's always had a thing for Darcy. Going way back.

917
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,346
1206 你们在哪里?
1206, where are you?

918
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:19,225
1206回覆 康妮 我们刚刚通过57号哩程标
1 206 here. Connie. We're just passing milepost 5- 7.

919
00:59:19,316 --> 00:59:20,977
你们大约还落后1.5哩
You're about a mile and a half behind.

920
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:25,352
777离阿克罗镇还有多远?
How far out of Arklow is 777?

921
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:28,063
7.5哩 还在加速 你们动作要快
Seven and a half miles. It picked up speed. You better step on it.

922
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:30,490
我们全速前进中
I'm stepping on it. in it. around it and through it. Connie.

923
00:59:30,577 --> 00:59:32,158
谢谢 完毕
Thank you. Over.

924
00:59:33,163 --> 00:59:36,826
她不断传简讯 我一直问她 她一直说没事
She's texting on the phone. I keep on asking for it. she keeps on saying no.

925
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:40,166
然后她走开 我抓住她...
She starts to walk away and I grab for it.

926
00:59:41,254 --> 00:59:42,994
- 你打她? - 我没有
- You hit her? - No. no. no.

927
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:48,087
我吓吓她 但我没有打她
I mean. I scared her. but I didn't hit her.

928
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,802
总之我开车到那家伙的家
Anyway. I drive to this guy's house

929
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,426
说我们得谈谈
and tell him we need to talk. Iet's take a ride.

930
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:55,348
他上了我的车后说
He jumps in my truck and starts in with.

931
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:57,926
"你误会了 他们只是朋友
"You got it all wrong. We're just friends."

932
00:59:58,021 --> 01:00:00,137
然后他停下来 他看到...
Then he stops once he sees

933
01:00:00,982 --> 01:00:03,348
我的车上有枪!
the gun I got sitting on the dash. Oh!

934
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:08,525
我看着他 跟他说 "这是我老婆 你去找别人当朋友吧
I look him in the eye and say. "She's my wife. You find a new friend."

935
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:09,980
你对警察掏枪?
You pulled a gun on a cop?

936
01:00:10,075 --> 01:00:11,440
法兰克?
Frank?

937
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:14,698
777刚通过61号哩程标
Frank. 777 just passed milepost 61.

938
01:00:15,997 --> 01:00:17,203
谢谢你 康妮
Thank you. Connie.

939
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:19,201
- 你想要听更劲爆的吗? - 我想
- You want to hear the kicker? - Yes. I do.

940
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:23,539
结果她传简讯的对象不是他 是我的小姨子
It wasn't even him that was texting her. It was my sister- in- law.

941
01:00:25,132 --> 01:00:27,794
总之等我到家 他的同事等候多时
Anyway. by the time I got home. his buddy's waiting for me.

942
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:31,001
等着拿禁制令给我
just waiting to serve me with this restraining order.

943
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:34,637
达儿希连看都不看我
Darcy wouldn't even look at me.

944
01:00:38,103 --> 01:00:40,719
我跟我哥住
So I'm living with my brother.

945
01:00:40,814 --> 01:00:43,897
今天有一场听证会 法官把禁制令又延长了30天
There was a hearing today. The judge ordered a 30- day extension.

946
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:50,066
本来一切还好好的
It's like one day everything's going okay.

947
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:52,488
突然有一天一切都敌了
and the next. it's all falling apart faster

948
01:00:52,576 --> 01:00:53,816
再也无法复原
than you can put it back together.

949
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,196
但总是不嫌太迟的
Yeah. Never too late. though.

950
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:04,250
福斯电视台

951
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:05,877
头条新闱

952
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:09,001
这辆39节车厢的失控列车
The plan to derail this 39- car runaway train

953
01:01:09,092 --> 01:01:10,798
就要进行脱轨计划了
is just minutes away now.

954
01:01:10,886 --> 01:01:12,922
现场非常骚动
There's a tremendous amount of activity going on.

955
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:16,130
这辆火车到底会不会停止呢?
Will this train be able to be stopped?

956
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:21,555
1206刚刚通过62号哩程标
1 206. Connie. We're just passing milepost 6- 2.

957
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:23,056
62号哩程标
Milepost 6- 2, over.

958
01:01:23,148 --> 01:01:24,763
还差一哩多
Still a mile gap. maybe more.

959
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:26,598
我们不够快
We're not gaining on her. Frank.

960
01:01:27,027 --> 01:01:28,767
等等
Hold on.

961
01:01:34,117 --> 01:01:35,982
这就像去打靶!
It's just like the shooting range!

962
01:01:36,077 --> 01:01:39,569
来了 准备行动!
All right. here we go! Come on! Let's go! This is it! It's game time!

963
01:01:38,455 --> 01:01:40,787
阿克罗镇北方2.1哩

964
01:01:44,544 --> 01:01:47,377
注意瞄准红色的安全闸!
Remember. we're aiming for the red circular button!

965
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:53,549
射击!
Now!

966
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:59,590
停火 你们打到油箱盖了 见鬼!
Hold your fire! You're shooting the fuel cap. God damn it!

967
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:01,049
停火!
Hold your fire!

968
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:03,726
我们本来要对安全闸开火
We were aiming to disable it by firing shotgun rounds

969
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:08,147
让列车停下来 我们开了几枪...
at a fuel stop safety switch, and so some shots were fired.

970
01:02:08,235 --> 01:02:11,147
安全闸是很小的目标
That safety switch is a mighty small target.

971
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:13,650
位置就在油箱旁边
And it's right next to a fuel tank.

972
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:20,406
我们没办法在阿克罗镇前赶上它
We're not gonna catch it before Arklow.

973
01:02:20,497 --> 01:02:23,489
法兰克 你们越来越近了 速度放慢
Frank. you're closing the gap. You should cut your speed.

974
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,911
留一点刹车的距离
Allow yourself some stopping distance. Just in case.

975
01:02:26,002 --> 01:02:28,709
没办法 我们现在减速就追不上
No can do. Connie. If we slow down now. we'll never catch it.

976
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:30,253
在斯坦顿之前追不上
Not before Stanton. Over.

977
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,671
你来决定
It's your call.

978
01:02:32,509 --> 01:02:35,842
我们得到消息 有二位铁路员工
However, we have now also learned that two railroad employees

979
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:40,343
正搭来一辆火车头追赶777
are now in pursuit of train 777 in a single locomotive.

980
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,798
目前还不知道他们追赶火车的计划...
It is unclear what their plan is...

981
01:02:41,893 --> 01:02:44,600
康妮胡波打来了
Connie Hooper for you.

982
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:48,021
我不是要你让1206离开主线了?
Did I or did I not tell you to get 1 206 off the main?

983
01:02:48,108 --> 01:02:49,518
我态度很好地跟他们说了啊
I asked them nicely.

984
01:02:55,865 --> 01:02:58,197
你百分之百确定脱轨器没用?
You're 1 00% sure that derailer won't work?

985
01:02:58,285 --> 01:03:00,651
百分之百不确定
Yes. 1 00%? No.

986
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:01,860
会成功还是不成功?
Which one is it?

987
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:06,785
- 机率一半一半 - 真好笑
- 50- 50. - Pretty funny.

988
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,992
如果它真的有用呢?
And if it does?

989
01:03:09,087 --> 01:03:12,875
如果有用 我们就惨了
If it does. then we're a wreck on a wreck.

990
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,295
这位是联邦铁路局的金恩
I'm here with FRA official Gene Devereaux.

991
01:03:16,386 --> 01:03:18,502
火车正在逼近 你们要怎么做?
This train is getting close. How is this going to work?

992
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:21,133
基本上它的作用就像斜坡
Basically, it works like a ramp.

993
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,556
列车开过来
The train comes along,

994
01:03:23,643 --> 01:03:27,511
这个东西就会往上 把列车拉离轨道
this piece here will lift the flange and pull it outside the rail.

995
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:31,644
这样列车就会往右翻倒
That will cause the train to flip over on its right- hand side.

996
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:33,316
让列车措手不及
Son of a bitch won 't even know what hit it.

997
01:03:41,703 --> 01:03:43,614
列车距离这里4分钟了!
Train's about four minutes out!

998
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:45,070
快发车!
Guys. come on. Get it started!

999
01:03:45,623 --> 01:03:46,829
大家动作快!
Guys. come on!

1000
01:03:49,586 --> 01:03:52,077
阿克罗镇北方0.5哩

1001
01:04:10,106 --> 01:04:11,767
- 失败了! - 怎么回事?
- It has not succeeded! - What?

1002
01:04:11,858 --> 01:04:13,143
那是怎么一回事?
What in the hell was that?

1003
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:17,352
那辆列车有1千万吨 盖文先生!
That was 1 0 million pounds of train. Mr. Galvin!

1004
01:04:17,447 --> 01:04:19,733
而这是我拯救你的声音!
And this is the sound of me saving your ass!

1005
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:21,898
法兰克 听到了吗?
Frank. do you copy?

1006
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:24,075
法兰克?
Frank?

1007
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:25,614
1206号车回覆
This is 1 206. Over.

1008
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:27,787
你说对了 火车连颠都没颠
You were right. It barely bumped.

1009
01:04:29,084 --> 01:04:30,790
我的老天
Jesus Christ.

1010
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:41,258
我们在现场为各位报导
We're bringing you live coverage right now

1011
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:44,179
这可能会酿成宾州史上
on what could very well result in one of the worst disasters

1012
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:47,382
最大灾难
in the history of the state of Pennsylvania.

1013
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:49,388
细节还要再调查
Now, the particulars are still being examined,

1014
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:51,515
但当局更关注...
but authorities are far more focused

1015
01:04:51,606 --> 01:04:55,224
777若在斯坦顿脱轨
on the potential destruction that would result if train 777

1016
01:04:55,318 --> 01:04:56,683
可能的危害
were to derail in Stanton.

1017
01:05:02,575 --> 01:05:04,486
你说自己结过一次婚是什么意思?
What'd you mean about being married once?

1018
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:08,411
我老婆艾丽丝死于癌症
Alice. my wife. she died of cancer.

1019
01:05:08,998 --> 01:05:10,738
- 4年前的事 - 我很遗憾
- Four years ago. - I'm sorry.

1020
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:12,324
我也是
Me. too.

1021
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:14,375
我也是
Me. too.

1022
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:20,336
每天晚上我回家都会和她分享工作
Every night. I'd come home. tell her about my day.

1023
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:23,964
我去了哪里 做了什么
where I'd been. what I hauled.

1024
01:05:27,058 --> 01:05:28,173
还有谁让我觉得讨厌
who annoyed me.

1025
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,259
我晚上应该会跟她说到你
Guess I would have made the evening report. huh?

1026
01:05:31,354 --> 01:05:33,345
你绝对会说
Yes. you would have made it. definitely.

1027
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:37,019
你应该打电话给你老婆
You should call your wife.

1028
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:41,065
她今天休假 大概还在睡觉
I would. but it's her day off. She's probably sleeping.

1029
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:43,522
别找藉口 吵醒她吧
Don't make excuses. Wake her up.

1030
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:45,865
我打了二礼拜的电话了
Been calling for the past two weeks.

1031
01:05:45,952 --> 01:05:46,987
她一通都没有回
She still hasn't called me back.

1032
01:05:47,078 --> 01:05:49,160
她不会回的 你要自己打给她
She won't. You got to call her.

1033
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:51,659
你搞不懂吗? 你太快放弃了
Don't you know how that works? You quit too easy.

1034
01:05:57,547 --> 01:05:59,208
宾州斯坦顿

1035
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:01,039
达儿希!
Darcy!

1036
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:03,044
达儿希!
Darcy!

1037
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:07,262
我一直在打电话给你
I have been calling and calling.

1038
01:06:09,184 --> 01:06:10,515
怎么了?
What is wrong?

1039
01:06:10,602 --> 01:06:13,969
如我们稍早报导的
As we told you earlier today, those emergency evacuations

1040
01:06:14,063 --> 01:06:18,056
今早这里有紧急撤离行动 以求居民安全
began early this morning as they try to move people out of harm's way.

1041
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:20,896
这是管制区域 现场的消防员...
You get a sense of the perimeter here. You see the firefighters...

1042
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:23,649
是我 我们正要出发
Hey. it's me. Yeah. we're on our way.

1043
01:06:24,657 --> 01:06:26,272
我知道 我正在看
Yeah. I know. I'm watching it.

1044
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:30,076
宾州阿克罗

1045
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:47,882
有二名铁路员工正驾驶一辆火车头
Two railroad employees are presently in pursuit of train 777

1046
01:06:47,972 --> 01:06:49,337
追赶777号列车
in a single locomotive.

1047
01:06:49,432 --> 01:06:52,344
似乎没人清楚如果他们赶上列车
No one seems exactly clear on what their plans are

1048
01:06:52,435 --> 01:06:54,096
打算怎么做
should they catch up to that train.

1049
01:06:54,187 --> 01:06:55,427
是爸爸
It's Dad.

1050
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:58,013
我们刚刚得知法兰克巴恩
We have just learned that railroad employee Frank Barnes,

1051
01:06:58,107 --> 01:07:01,645
28年年资 负责列车驾驶...
a 28- year veteran of the freight company responsible for the runaway,

1052
01:07:01,736 --> 01:07:05,149
还有列车长威尔考森都在车上
and Will Colson, a conductor, are now onboard another locomotive.

1053
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,275
我们要过去了
We're on our way.

1054
01:07:06,366 --> 01:07:08,231
他们试图追赶...
A single locomotive trying to catch up

1055
01:07:08,326 --> 01:07:09,532
- 失控列车 - 她需要穿衣服
- to the runaway train. - She's gotta get dressed.

1056
01:07:09,619 --> 01:07:11,234
- 为了成功 他们... - 我看到了
- And get this. They were traveling... - I can tell.

1057
01:07:11,329 --> 01:07:12,409
她马上过去
She'll be ready in a minute.

1058
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:14,283
... 以时速70哩反向前进
... at speeds of up to 70 miles an hour in reverse.

1059
01:07:14,374 --> 01:07:16,456
777号列车现在距离...只有短短几英里路程
777 is now just miles away from the significantly...

1060
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:18,454
达儿希 快去穿衣服
Come on. Darcy. Iet's go. Come on. get dressed.

1061
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:20,456
...人口更加密集的斯坦顿
...more populated town of Stanton.

1062
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,543
快走!
Let's go. boys!

1063
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,211
距离斯坦顿11哩

1064
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:46,902
你们已经接近了
Okay. you're getting close.

1065
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,572
相差1哩 777离斯坦顿有10哩
The gap's at a mile and 777 is 1 0 miles to Stanton.

1066
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:52,901
听着 法兰克 这里有位联邦铁路局来的人
Now. Iisten. Frank. I got a guy here named Werner from the FRA.

1067
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:54,987
我不想质疑你的判断 但...
Now. I'm inclined to defer to your judgment here. but he...

1068
01:07:55,081 --> 01:07:58,244
让他说话 我们有越多协助越好
All right. Put him on. We could use all the help we can get.

1069
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:01,701
压住这个键说话
Just press this and hold to talk.

1070
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:06,589
你们一接上777就要让它减速
It's about slowing 777 once you've tied on.

1071
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:08,541
我知道传统上...
I know conventional wisdom says

1072
01:08:08,636 --> 01:08:11,173
会要你往反方向拉它就好
to just gun it in the opposite direction.

1073
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:13,175
但如果你用动力刹车
But you'll have a better shot

1074
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:16,099
跟前进的动力轮替比较会成功
alternating full throttle with dynamic braking.

1075
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,517
但我们不能失去反推力
Yeah. but we can't afford to lose counterthrust.

1076
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:20,724
失去的反推力
What you'll lose in counterthrust

1077
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:22,555
会被牵引力抵销
you'll compensate for in tractive force.

1078
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:24,266
你确定吗?
Are you sure about that?

1079
01:08:27,363 --> 01:08:30,070
这是我快速推算后的直觉
Well. it's more of a hunch based on some quick calculations.

1080
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:32,273
是直觉啊
It's a hunch.

1081
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:35,485
我时速70哩 他居然只靠直觉
I'm 70 miles an hour and he's giving us a hunch.

1082
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,413
谢谢 请让康妮听电话
Okay. Thank you. Put Connie back on. please.

1083
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:39,784
是我 法兰克
It's me, Frank.

1084
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:42,709
康妮 这家伙懂吗?
Yeah. Connie. does this guy know what he's talking about?

1085
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:45,874
在理想的情况下
In a perfect world.

1086
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,756
我会说他懂
yes. I'd say yes.

1087
01:08:48,843 --> 01:08:50,629
理想的情况...好吧
In a perfect world. okay.

1088
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,087
在宾州郊区失控的列车后续报导
We have more now on that runaway freight train in rural Pennsylvania.

1089
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:57,091
他们提出一个让列车停止的计划
They've devised an ambitious plan to bring it to a stop.

1090
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:59,972
让另外一个车头从后面接近列车
A single locomotive moves in from behind,

1091
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:04,227
赶上、连结 然后刹车 好让它减速
catches up, hooks up and then brakes in an effort to slow it down.

1092
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,605
通过76号哩程标 康妮
Passing milepost 7 - 6. Connie. Over.

1093
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,319
只差半哩了
You're only a half mile away.

1094
01:09:10,406 --> 01:09:11,816
半哩 好
Half a mile. Out.

1095
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,698
法兰克 既然是反向 你要怎么判断后方相差的距离?
Frank. running in reverse. how are you gonna gauge our gap distance?

1096
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:19,912
我可以到外面给你打手势
I could go out there. I could signal you by hand.

1097
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:22,831
在时速70哩的时候?
At 70 mile an hour?

1098
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:23,908
不管 这样有用吗?
I'm asking. Would it help?

1099
01:09:27,757 --> 01:09:30,043
好 用对讲机跟手势
All right. Radio and hand signals.

1100
01:09:30,134 --> 01:09:32,090
我们一起合作 你要小心
We'll combinate. And be careful.

1101
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:33,338
我会
I will.

1102
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:34,677
还有 把背心脱掉
And take that vest off. too.

1103
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:36,504
- 为什么? - 叫你脱 你就脱
- Why? - Just take it off.

1104
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:37,588
我不想往后
I don't want to look out this window

1105
01:09:37,684 --> 01:09:39,720
看到你穿着黄背心 我会吓坏
and see you in that yellow vest. It'll freak me out.

1106
01:09:58,788 --> 01:09:59,777
接电话啊 威尔

1107

三节车厢 收到
Three cars steady. Copy.

01:11:02,935 --> 01:11:04,425
稳住 稳住!
Steady. steady!

1122
01:11:06,272 --> 01:11:08,763
威尔考森试着连结1206
Will Colson is trying to hook up 1206

1123
01:11:08,858 --> 01:11:10,394
- 和777 - 我的天哪
- with 777. - Oh. my God.

1124
01:11:15,072 --> 01:11:17,358
出了严重的差错
Something has gone terribly wrong.

1125
01:11:23,414 --> 01:11:25,200
威尔 怎么回事?
Will. what was that?

1126
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,157
谷粒被吹飞了!
The grain car blew a seal!

1127
01:11:29,712 --> 01:11:31,293
我们连结上了吗?
Are we tied off?

1128
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:34,255
怎么回事?
Will, what's going on?

1129
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:39,711
现在看到的是救援行动的现场画面
Right now we are looking at live pictures of this rescue operation.

1130
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:41,546
我们连结上了吗?
Are we tied off?

1131
01:11:42,683 --> 01:11:45,299
没有 连结器关上了!
No. Frank. it didn't work. Our knuckle closed!

1132
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:48,101
威尔 跟我比手势 用手势!
Will. use hand signals! Hand signals!

1133
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:58,900
连结上了吗?
We tied on?

1134
01:11:59,075 --> 01:12:00,360
好了 好了!
We're good! We're good!

1135
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:01,657
你说什么?
What?

1136
01:12:08,751 --> 01:12:10,287
该死
Oh. shit.

1137
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:12,793
法兰克 连结器没有落锁!
Frank. the pin didn't fall!

1138
01:12:12,922 --> 01:12:14,662
再说一次 什么?
Say again. The what?

1139
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:17,002
我们接上了没?
Will. are we tied on?

1140
01:12:17,093 --> 01:12:19,550
不行 连结器没有落锁
It's not gonna work. The pin didn't fall.

1141
01:12:19,637 --> 01:12:20,672
什么?
What?

1142
01:12:20,763 --> 01:12:23,721
连结器有问题 没有锁上!
The pin didn't fall! It's not locking!

1143
01:12:24,058 --> 01:12:25,844
好 听着
All right. well. Iook.

1144
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:29,052
下去看看可以怎么办 你要小心!
Try and get down there. see what you can do. Be careful!

1145
01:12:29,605 --> 01:12:30,970
你要小心
Be careful.

1146
01:12:40,283 --> 01:12:41,363
威尔!
Will!

1147
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,533
列车没有减速 反倒加速了
It's not slowing down. It's gaining speed right now.

1148
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,611
他到下面去连接...
He's reaching down, trying to couple...

1149
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,375
威尔 你收得到吗?
Will. can you read me?

1150
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:12,766
他不见了!
He's gone!

1151
01:13:16,652 --> 01:13:20,110
威尔考森滑下去了 我们看不见他
Will Colson is down. We do not see him.

1152
01:13:21,657 --> 01:13:23,397
43号直升机能将镜头拉近吗?
Chopper 43, can you zoom in?

1153
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:27,285
- 我们看不到列车长威尔考森 - 加油 宝贝
- We do not see the conductor, Colson. - Come on. baby.

1154
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,833
威尔 你收得到吗? 威尔!
Will. can you read me? Will!

1155
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:50,592
43号直升机 拉近镜头 看到他了 威尔考森
Chopper 43, zoom in. There he is. Will Colson.

1156
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:56,939
他挣扎着把自己拉上来
As he struggles to pull himself up,

1157
01:13:57,026 --> 01:13:59,358
看来威尔考森有麻烦了
Iooks like Will Colson is in trouble.

1158
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,068
二辆车连接了
The train is coupled.

1159
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:12,781
我听说二辆车已经接好了
I'm now being told that the connection has been made.

1160
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,457
看起来列车连接上了
It looks as though this train is now attached.

1161
01:14:15,544 --> 01:14:19,583
1206已经成功接上777
1 206 has been successfully attached to 777.

1162
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:22,541
但威尔考森似乎受伤了
But it looks like Will Colson is injured.

1163
01:14:24,303 --> 01:14:26,339
你还好吗?
You all right?

1164
01:14:27,723 --> 01:14:29,054
我很好
I'm great.

1165
01:14:30,351 --> 01:14:32,262
不要碰触靴子
Hey. hey. don't touch that! Don't touch that boot!

1166
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:34,802
用这个缠住就好!
Here. just wrap it up with this.

1167
01:14:34,897 --> 01:14:37,013
整个都缠好 紧紧缠住
Wrap it real tight. all around.

1168
01:14:37,608 --> 01:14:38,768
你还可以吗?
You okay?

1169
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:40,815
没事 没事
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1170
01:14:42,738 --> 01:14:45,696
巴恩和考森赶上了这辆失控列车
Barnes and Colson have caught up to the runaway train.

1171
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:47,614
达儿希 走吧
Darcy. come on. Come on.

1172
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:51,570
但火车依旧以75哩的时速
But the train continues to speed in excess of 75 miles an hour,

1173
01:14:51,664 --> 01:14:52,824
往斯坦顿前进
heading to Stanton.

1174
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:57,450
康妮 现在距离多远?
Connie. how far we got?

1175
01:14:57,545 --> 01:14:59,752
距离斯坦顿多远?
How far to Stanton? Over.

1176
01:15:01,298 --> 01:15:03,584
还有4哩 你们做得很棒
4 miles. You guys are doing great.

1177
01:15:03,676 --> 01:15:04,961
但时间紧迫
You're cutting it close. though.

1178
01:15:05,052 --> 01:15:06,417
威尔怎么样?
How's Will?

1179
01:15:07,263 --> 01:15:10,255
他很惨 完毕
He's... He's different. Over.

1180
01:15:13,561 --> 01:15:15,426
准备好拔河了吗?
Ready for a little tug- of- war?

1181
01:15:16,272 --> 01:15:17,432
来吧
Let's do it.

1182
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:29,149
我们要试着跟列车的速度一致
Match our speed with theirs.

1183
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,366
- 我们会扯断连结 - 不会的
- Frank. we're gonna snap right off. - No. we're not. we're not.

1184
01:15:38,461 --> 01:15:41,953
只是会拉扯而已 没事的
We're just stretching. that's all. We're just stretching.

1185
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:48,133
斯坦顿
Here in Stanton,

1186
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,553
持续撤离全镇居民
the evacuation procedures continue for the entire town.

1187
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:56,134
主线轨道会在这里升高进入弯道
This is the town where that mainline train track turns into an elevated curve.

1188
01:15:56,228 --> 01:15:58,184
据说这辆高速的...
They say there is virtually no chance

1189
01:15:58,272 --> 01:16:00,183
失控列车几乎不可能
this speeding, out- of- control train

1190
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:01,855
通过这个弯道
will make it through that curve.

1191
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:10,485
我们应该要减速
We should be slowing down.

1192
01:16:10,576 --> 01:16:12,237
但是没有
Which we're not.

1193
01:16:12,328 --> 01:16:14,114
该死
Shoot.

1194
01:16:15,206 --> 01:16:18,698
改用动力刹车 跟全速前进轮替
Go to the dynamic. Alternate full throttle.

1195
01:16:30,721 --> 01:16:32,586
那些刹车快被操斓了
Christ! Those cab brakes are getting a workout.

1196
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:35,263
...因为载运有害物质...
...because of the highly toxic nature of the cargo.

1197
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:36,386
法兰克 加油
Come on. Frank.

1198
01:16:36,727 --> 01:16:38,342
减速吧 宝贝
Come on. baby.

1199
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,600
我们速度多少?
What's our speed?

1200
01:16:45,736 --> 01:16:47,021
低于50哩了
We're under 50.

1201
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:48,944
康妮 目前距离多远?
Connie. how far away?

1202
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:51,693
3哩 我已经安排人手待命
3 miles. FRA's got men on the ground ready to hop onboard

1203
01:16:51,784 --> 01:16:53,115
你们一减速到20他们就会跳上车
as soon as you guys get it under 20.

1204
01:16:53,202 --> 01:16:54,863
叫他们准备跳吧
All right. Tell them. be ready to hop. Over.

1205
01:17:03,796 --> 01:17:04,956
该死!
Shoot!

1206
01:17:13,305 --> 01:17:15,045
- 怎么回事? - 速度加快了
- What is it? - We're gaining speed.

1207
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:17,928
列车太重 我们被拖着走了
Consist is too heavy. We're being dragged.

1208
01:17:27,236 --> 01:17:28,476
康妮!
Connie!

1209
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:29,852
我在这里 法兰克
I'm here. Frank.

1210
01:17:29,947 --> 01:17:31,687
我们的速度太快了
We're gonna be coming in too hot.

1211
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:34,190
通知联邦铁路局的人
Let them know.

1212
01:17:34,285 --> 01:17:35,866
弯道的速限是15哩
The limit on that curve is 1 5.

1213
01:17:35,953 --> 01:17:39,992
快太多就过不去 顶多20到25还可以?
I don't know if you can take it much faster. maybe 20. 25. max?

1214
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:42,698
我没有选择 告诉他们我们的速度会很快
We may not have a choice. Just tell them it's gonna be real hot.

1215
01:17:49,592 --> 01:17:50,923
车厢的刹车可不可以用?
What about the braking on the freight cars?

1216
01:17:55,764 --> 01:17:56,799
很好
Good. good.

1217
01:17:56,891 --> 01:17:57,846
我来
All right. I'm on it.

1218
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,049
坐下 我去 你坐好 
Just sit down. No. no. I've got it. Sit tight.

1219
01:18:00,144 --> 01:18:02,760
我到外面去 你过来吧 
I'll go out. Sit down. No. in fact. come here.

1220
01:18:02,855 --> 01:18:05,016
你坐在这边 我到外面去
You sit here. I'll go out.

1221
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:06,517
维持在4
Just keep it at four.

1222
01:18:07,735 --> 01:18:09,100
可以吗?
You all right? Take it easy. Yeah.

1223
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:10,772
握住刹车把手推到4
Hold that dynamic at a four. Four.

1224
01:18:10,863 --> 01:18:12,194
必要时跟前进动力搭配 
Integrate it with the throttle if you have to.

1225
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:14,192
维持在4 跟前进动力搭配 
Hold it at a four. integrate the throttle.

1226
01:18:14,283 --> 01:18:16,365
尽量操刹车块 不重要
Burn the block out. it doesn't matter.

1227
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:18,780
别突然感伤起来
Hey. don't get sentimental on me.

1228
01:18:19,288 --> 01:18:21,529
你让我感觉我快死了 你握好就对
Makes me think I'm gonna die. Just hold that four.

1229
01:18:41,977 --> 01:18:43,888
加油 法兰克
Come on. Frank.

1230
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:46,015
铁路公司不予置评
AWVR officials have no comment.

1231
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:50,107
巴恩要动手 将777最后一节车厢煞住
Barnes is attempting to manually brake the last car of 777.

1232
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:03,741
他在列车项上迸走...
He's actually running on top of the grain cars and jumping...

1233
01:19:03,832 --> 01:19:05,572
法兰克 加油
Way to go. Frank. Let's go. Frank.

1234
01:19:14,176 --> 01:19:16,508
看来777的确减速了
Looks like 777 is slowing down.

1235
01:19:19,348 --> 01:19:21,430
我们明白 这么做
We understand this is some sort of

1236
01:19:21,517 --> 01:19:23,599
是为了让列车减速
an attempt to try and stop the train.

1237
01:19:23,686 --> 01:19:25,597
好样的 加油! 你可以的!
Yes! Come on. come on! You can do it!

1238
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:30,935
你们现在速度多少?
Will. how fast you going?

1239
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,190
34哩
34.

1240
01:19:38,659 --> 01:19:40,149
我们在减速了 33哩
All right. we're dropping. 33.

1241
01:19:40,244 --> 01:19:43,202
铁路公司发言人确认...
The railroad spokesman just confirmed he is...

1242
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:44,825
- 这样管用吗? - ...巴恩现在动手
- Think it'll work? - ...attempting to slow 777

1243
01:19:44,915 --> 01:19:47,281
把各车厢刹车开启
by manually braking each car.

1244
01:19:47,376 --> 01:19:48,786
理论上可行
Theoretically.

1245
01:19:48,877 --> 01:19:51,539
只要车头的独立刹车没问题
Provided that locomotive's independent brake holds out.

1246
01:19:59,263 --> 01:20:02,130
继续在斯坦顿现场报导
We continue to bring you live coverage of this breaking news event

1247
01:20:02,224 --> 01:20:03,304
头条新闱
from the town of Stanton.

1248
01:20:03,392 --> 01:20:06,099
紧急小组划出管制区...
Emergency management officials have created this perimeter.

1249
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:13,144
这是警察 请撤离屋项
This is the police. Get off the roof.

1250
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:15,567
为了你们的安全 请马上离开
You are being asked to evacuate for your own safety.

1251
01:20:51,023 --> 01:20:52,138
该死!
Shit!

1252
01:20:54,735 --> 01:20:55,815
法兰克!
Frank!

1253
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:57,984
我听到了!
Yeah. I hear you. I hear you!

1254
01:20:58,072 --> 01:20:59,608
我们的刹车坏了!
We just lost our brakes!

1255
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:04,024
看来刹车爆了
Looks like the brakes have blown.

1256
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:05,450
见鬼!
Shit!

1257
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:17,793
法兰克 法兰克 你没事吧?
Frank! Frank. you all right?

1258
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,256
我没事 威尔 怎么回事?
I'm here. Will. What happened?

1259
01:21:20,386 --> 01:21:22,251
我们又加速了
We're picking up speed again.

1260
01:21:24,807 --> 01:21:28,720
你能不能设法让它减速? 我们快到弯道了
Can you still slow it down? We're almost at the curve.

1261
01:21:28,811 --> 01:21:31,473
法兰克 引擎已经过热了
Frank. our engine block's overheated.

1262
01:21:33,107 --> 01:21:34,517
我认为手动刹车
I don't think those hand brakes are gonna

1263
01:21:34,608 --> 01:21:35,939
也没办法减速
have the muscle to stop this thing.

1264
01:21:36,026 --> 01:21:37,266
速度实在太快
We're creeping up fast.

1265
01:21:37,361 --> 01:21:39,773
你用独立刹车吧
All right. well. just hang on to the independent.

1266
01:21:40,656 --> 01:21:42,317
我会告诉你时间点
I'll tell you when.

1267
01:22:02,469 --> 01:22:06,929
火车进入第二级的高架铁轨 这里的时速限制是15哩
Elevated and strictly Class 2, speed restricted to 1 5 miles per hour.

1268
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:08,880
正下方的三栋建筑
Impact with at least three of these buildings

1269
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:10,682
会无法幸免
directly below will be unavoidable,

1270
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:14,182
这里的燃料槽也一样
as will contact with all the fuel storage tanks situated here.

1271
01:22:14,982 --> 01:22:17,189
威尔? 威尔
Will? Will.

1272
01:22:17,943 --> 01:22:19,183
我们没事
We're all right. we're all right.

1273
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,859
但速度又加快了
but we're picking up speed again.

1274
01:22:34,001 --> 01:22:35,081
威尔!
Will!

1275
01:22:36,545 --> 01:22:39,537
我们要进入弯道了 准备了!
We're coming into the curve! Get ready!

1276
01:22:53,645 --> 01:22:56,387
威尔 拉独立刹车杆!
Will! Hit that independent!

1277
01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:59,435
用力拉刹车杆!
Hit that independent as hard as you can!

1278
01:23:06,617 --> 01:23:08,073
我们会脱轨
Frank. we're gonna rip right off.

1279
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:09,734
我们没有选择
Got no choice.

1280
01:23:19,963 --> 01:23:21,749
威尔 撑住!
Will! Hang on!

1281
01:23:30,724 --> 01:23:32,931
拉! 再拉一次!
Hit it! Hit it again!

1282
01:23:34,269 --> 01:23:35,349
就是现在!
Now!

1283
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:03,248
法兰克 你没事吧?
Frank. you all right?

1284
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,127
我们成功了 通过弯道了 他们成功通过弯道了
We made it! We made it! We're through the curve.

1285
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,587
777成功了 已经通过弯道
777 made it. It made it through the Stanton curve.

1286
01:24:11,682 --> 01:24:13,638
777已经通过弯道
777 is through the Stanton curve,

1287
01:24:13,725 --> 01:24:15,807
但问题还没有结束
but by no means out of trouble.

1288
01:24:15,894 --> 01:24:19,853
777正在加速 失去控制 必须要让它脱轨才行
777 is gaining speed. It is out of control and has to derail.

1289
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,305
法兰克和威尔
Frank Barnes and Will Colson will be

1290
01:24:22,401 --> 01:24:24,232
会成为东北区史上
the victims of the biggest rail disaster

1291
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:25,809
最严重铁路意外的受害者
in the history of the northeast.

1292
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:31,319
看来法兰克巴忍拼了
It looks like Frank Barnes is making an all- out effort.

1293
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:32,945
太好了
Good job.

1294
01:24:33,036 --> 01:24:36,654
了不起 他要前往777的车头
This is a remarkable effort now to get to the front of 777.

1295
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:43,831
法兰克!
Frank!

1296
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:48,090
我们速度到60了 很快就会到80哩!
We're at... We're at 60. and we're going to hit 80 in no time!

1297
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,260
他过不去
He's not gonna make it.

1298
01:24:54,725 --> 01:24:56,841
看来车厢间的距离让他止步了
Looks like the gap between cars has stopped him.

1299
01:24:56,935 --> 01:24:58,141
继续啊!
You can do it!

1300
01:24:58,228 --> 01:25:02,141
列车持续以75哩的时速前进
But the train continues to speed in excess of 75 miles an hour.

1301
01:25:02,524 --> 01:25:05,186
法兰克 法兰克!
Frank! Frank!

1302
01:25:05,736 --> 01:25:07,727
有问题了
Will. we got a problem here.

1303
01:25:10,324 --> 01:25:11,780
我做不到
I don't think I can make it.

1304
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:15,449
天啊
Oh. God.

1305
01:25:24,463 --> 01:25:26,419
是奈德!
There's Ned!

1306
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:32,084
不可思议 不可思议
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1307
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:38,840
奈德 我是康妮
Hello. Ned. it's Connie.

1308
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:41,142
我现在有点忙 康妮 我再打给你
I'm kind of busy right now. Connie. I'll call you back.

1309
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:01,951
嘿!
Hey!

1310
01:26:06,838 --> 01:26:08,203

Come on!

1311
01:26:12,761 --> 01:26:14,626
跳到卡车后车厢!
Hop in the back of the truck!

1312
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:18,843
跳到卡车后车厢!
Hop in the back of the truck!

1313
01:26:18,934 --> 01:26:22,051
康妮 那辆卡车是来帮我们的吗?
Connie? Connie. is that truck for us?

1314
01:26:22,688 --> 01:26:25,020
是 威尔 你做得到
Yes. it is. Will. You can do this.

1315
01:26:25,107 --> 01:26:27,063
你可以的!
Will, you can do this!

1316
01:26:32,948 --> 01:26:34,154
加油!
Come on!

1317
01:26:39,496 --> 01:26:44,115
...停止列车 在主线...

1318
01:26:47,337 --> 01:26:49,248
看来他们想要获得
Looks like he's trying to synchronize

1319
01:26:49,339 --> 01:26:52,126
与火车同步的速度
the speed of the pickup with the train.

1320
01:26:52,843 --> 01:26:56,210
快跳 不要犹豫 跳到后面!
Do it. you pussy! Jump in the back!

1321
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:02,883
好样的!

好样的!
Yeah!

1324
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,321
真是千钧一发
And look at what's happening now.

1325
01:27:16,408 --> 01:27:18,444
红色卡车要把他载到车头
The red pickup racing to the front of 777.

1326
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:20,025

1327
01:27:29,671 --> 01:27:30,877

Go. go!

1331
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:53,687
奈德快要没有路可以跑了
Ned Oldham is running out of parallel road.

1332
01:27:54,446 --> 01:27:55,777
加油 威尔
Come on. Will.

1333
01:27:55,864 --> 01:27:57,229
奈德 快开啊!
Drive. Ned!

1334
01:27:57,324 --> 01:27:59,360
他企图登上列车
He will attempt to board this train.

1335
01:28:19,304 --> 01:28:21,090
- 快点 - 该死

1336
01:28:21,181 --> 01:28:22,387
见鬼 过头了!

天啊!
Oh. my God!

1345
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:15,478
加油 威尔 加油!
Go! Go. Will!

1346
01:29:15,569 --> 01:29:19,027
威尔考森成功进入驾驶室
Will Colson successfully making it into the cab,

1347
01:29:19,114 --> 01:29:21,105
777受到控制了
now in control of 777.

1348
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:46,213
43号直升机捕捉到这重大的一刻
Chopper 43 over this remarkable aftermath.

1349
01:29:46,308 --> 01:29:49,141
