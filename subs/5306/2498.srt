00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,016
Last day.

9
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,551
So it is.

10
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:21,316
Sorry, boys,
there's been a delay.

11
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,320
Where the fuck's Bradley?

12
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:25,447
He's taking care of shit
at the airport.

13
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,958
We've got a flight
to Mexico City to catch.

14
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,823
Negative.
We've got a delay.

15
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,227
Why don't you guys
hole up in town for a little bit?

16
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:33,821
There's a nice little bar there.

17
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,389
We'll meet you at 1800 hours.

18
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,492
Got it. I'll tell Bradley
to meet us there.

19
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:39,127
Until then.

20
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,365
( Both chuckle)

-( distant prisoners shouting )
-( gate buzzes )

22
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:11,324
Mm, Fields.

23
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,898
Here you go.

24
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,873
Nice.

25
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,739
Hell, something
smells good there.

26
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,676
Mm-hmm.

27
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,179
The woman sure can cook.

28
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,737
You got yourself
a lady in the kitchen?

29
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,977
Maybe.

30
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,246
Well, the way you're eating
that burrito,

31
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:29,810
you should marry her.

32
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:31,515
-( laughs )
- Why not?

33
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:33,023
Nobody cooks
that good, man.

34
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,889
Yeah, but you'd have someone to go
home to every night. Think about it.

35
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,417
I'd just get bored.

36
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,158
Yeah, well, being bored,
that's the secret,

37
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:43,429
I think-- bored,
but being happy, like me.

38
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,764
You're happy?

39
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,032
Yeah. Don't I look happy?

40
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,766
An exciting life

41
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,570
is a good way
to get yourself killed.

42
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,576
Remember that.

43
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,740
- You heard?
- All right. Hey, you want one?

44
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,340
No way.

45
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,394
( Knocks )

46
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:14,788
( lock beeps,
door opens )

47
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,956
How are you doing?

48
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:43,215
Man: Open it up.

49
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,554
(guards conversing )

50
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,158
HSO team just rolled in.

51
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:57,133
I said we'd meet them in 10,
at 1300.

52
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:59,295
Yeah, but oddly enough,
transport still hasn't shown up.

53
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,134
We're waiting
on the marshals again.

54
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,106
We're waiting on
the fucking bus?

55
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,130
Guess so.

56
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:05,972
God damn it.

57
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:08,239
I still can't believe I let you
convince me to come here

58
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,304
to shut down
a couple of bullshit buildings.

59
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,509
I usually make
the mess, brother.

60
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:14,381
You got me
cleaning this one up.

61
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,148
See, the thing of it is,
you're getting old, man.

62
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:17,449
I got to let you down easy.

63
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:20,855
But the thing of it is, when I want
somebody to cover my back,

64
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,382
you're my man.

65
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:24,224
All our guys-
they're the best.

66
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,629
The way I look at it, you'll be
down in Mexico in the next few days

67
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:30,224
and there's 4,000 ways
to get killed down there,

68
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,997
so watch your ass.

69
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,970
Thanks for trying
to cheer me up.

70
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,098
( laughs)

71
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,903
Last time was a real
clusterfuck, wasn't it?

72
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,376
- Lost some damn good men.
- Yeah.

73
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,073
Army brass should have never
pulled us out of that shithole.

74
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:44,877
Man, why do you act
so surprised?

75
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:47,612
That's the way all these highfalutin
military pricks is, man.

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,313
- You know that.
-( gate buzzes )

77
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,720
We're the first guys
that they piss on.

78
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,419
Anyway, next week
you'll get some payback, man.

79
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,950
And speaking of pricks...

80
00:07:56,983 --> 00:08:00,430
Every time I get another stack
of bullshit paperwork,

81
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,455
your fingerprints
are all over it, Cross.

82
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,196
Yeah, I thought your job
was bullshit paperwork.

83
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,828
- Shut up.
- Negative, Warden.

84
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,361
I ain't got to shut up.

85
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,271
Go hide behind your desk.
We're done here.

86
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,298
- No, you're not.
- We kind of are, man,

87
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:15,141
'cause this bitch
is fully decommissioned.

88
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,147
I took us off the grid, man--

89
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,309
computers, satellites, phones-
everything.

90
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,320
Transport will be here soon
to get the detainees.

91
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,377
We're done.

92
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,754
No, you booked in two more
high-security assets last night.

93
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,417
You reopened block D

94
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,757
right after you and Manning
permanently shut it down.

95
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,354
See, you have to
understand something-

96
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,832
this is a black site,

97
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,529
specifically designed
for people of interest.

98
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:41,128
No, no, no, it was a black site,
Cross-- was.

99
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:44,834
You security contractors-
you're all the same.

100
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:48,243
You think you're hot shit ex-soldiers,
big fucking heroes.

101
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,110
Well, you're a pain in my ass.

102
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,446
We already had four people
of special interest here.

103
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:54,644
We don't have enough MP-s
to legally hold

104
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,414
all the fucking interesting
people we got,

105
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,615
let alone the two
who came in last night.

106
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:01,284
When you signed those two in last
night, you took authority over them.

107
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:04,123
That means signing them out
will be your job, not mine.

108
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,152
I would enjoy the process.

109
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:09,394
Well, the transfer unit's late,
so you're going nowhere

110
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,528
till all the detainees have cleared
the gate on the way out.

111
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,542
( Gate buzzes )

112
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:11,687
( prisoners shouting )

113
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:19,167
Step away from the bars.

114
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,364
Detainees, step back.

115
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,395
Let me out!

116
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:29,038
Detainees, step back.

117
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,674
(man screams)

118
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:34,082
What the fuck?

119
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:36,086
Fucking liars!

120
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm gonna fucking kill you guys!

121
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,353
I'll fucking kill you all!

122
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,455
Chow. Bring him in.

123
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,660
Fuck you.
I'm not eating that shit.

124
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,464
Don't ever touch me.

125
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,340
Code red.
Backup in the courtyard.

126
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:59,434
Repeat, backup in the courtyard!
Code red.

127
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:01,467
Fucking killers!

128
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,987
( Man shouting )

129
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,822
Open the courtyard gate.

130
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,759
Open the courtyard.

131
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,791
( Gate buzzes )

132
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,971
What's the problem, man?
What's the problem?

133
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:39,607
Inmate: Come on, man.
Want something?

134
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,474
(grunting )

135
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:43,373
Boss. Okay, boss.

136
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,547
- You all right?
- Fuck you.

137
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,989
Sir, I found this kite
in the corridor.

138
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:56,254
I don't know if the inmates
are trying to communicate,

139
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:57,784
but I thought
you should know.

140
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,057
All right.

141
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,792
Be cool.

142
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:07,933
I'ma get you.
Fuck you. I'ma get you.

143
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,173
Let me see that.

144
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,153
( Gate buzzes )

145
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,654
Whoa.

146
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,559
The name on the manifest
says Rick.

147
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,995
The name tag says Max.
You want to explain that?

148
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,159
The truck rolled
over his foot yesterday.

149
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:40,534
Um, I usually work dispatch.

150
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,698
Short-staffed, so...

151
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,799
Almost wrapped up here,
so let's get it done.

152
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,505
Sorry, you know, I was trying
to sneak in a bit of overtime.

153
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,481
Wife's birthday,
you know, coming up.

154
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:53,540
Why don't we catch up
some other time, all right?

155
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,815
Just get on with your job
so I can get the fuck out of here.

156
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:04,788
Manning:
Sanders, guard the fort.

157
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:18,900
(machine whirring)

158
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,672
( metal squeaking )

159
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:23,543
( metallic rattling )

160
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,708
- Don't tell me you fucked this up.
- I don't know.

161
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,479
All you had to do
was push a goddamn button.

162
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:29,679
Sounds like
something snapped.

163
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,847
Something snapped?
Is that your professional opinion

164
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,982
or just a wild fucking guess?

165
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,696
Shit, I'm gonna die of old age
in this motherfucker.

166
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,221
Get the truck, pull it out.
We need to take a look.

167
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:44,165
Pull it out.

168
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,205
(engine starts)

169
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:58,170
Kill it. Kill it.

170
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:01,776
-( Engine stops)
- I'm smelling diesel out here.

171
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,753
The truck won't disengage.

172
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,847
Something's definitely stuck
back there.

173
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:08,381
You might want to call your buddies to
come down here and give you some help.

174
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,587
( Chuckles )
Yeah, good luck with that.

175
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,722
Friday night-- everyone's
packed out till Monday.

176
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,959
Manning: Shit.

177
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:19,002
I got it.

178
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,400
I'll see what I can do.

179
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,000
(gate buzzes, lock clicks)

180
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,746
Hey, bud, it's Manning.

181
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,012
Hey, listen, we've got an issue
with the garbage truck.

182
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,487
Something's jammed in there
and I'm smelling diesel fumes.

183
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,047
Well, you know, block D
is on the same ventilation system

184
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,456
as maintenance.

185
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes, sir, same place you booked in
two assets last night.

186
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,455
Fuck. I'm gonna head
down there right now.

187
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:50,160
Anyway, I'll take care of it.

188
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:52,669
I don't think either of us
is gonna make it out of here tonight.

189
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,000
Wonderful.

190
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,214
I was about to contact you
on the radio, sir.

191
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:07,274
I'm smelling diesel
down here.

192
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,877
Yeah, I know. I'm moving
the detainees as we speak.

193
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:13,082
- Where are we gonna put them?
- Unfortunately, block G.

194
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:14,749
Seriously?

195
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,727
Those fucking guys are gonna go crazy
when they know about them.

196
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,660
Unfortunately, I don't have
much of a choice.

197
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,562
You know, it's only
for a couple of hours.

198
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,464
Everybody's transferring
out tonight.

199
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,491
So let's just do it.

200
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,867
All right, girls,
let's go for a walk.

201
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,843
Let's see your hands, girls.

202
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:44,045
Woman:
Please listen to me.

203
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,919
I'm a foreign national.

204
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,946
My government
has no idea where I am.

205
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,756
Cross: Right.
And you're a political prisoner.

206
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:52,762
I know.
I've heard that before, man.

207
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:55,594
Every motherfucker in here
that's wrapped in skin

208
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,066
is a political prisoner.

209
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,569
I'm no idiot, okay?
I know what this place is

210
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:01,867
and I know where
guys like you come from.

211
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:04,374
If you don't help me,
then I'm dead.

212
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,342
Went in the boiler room,
grabbed some tools.

213
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:09,574
I went ahead and shut the heat down
to G block while I was there, FYI.

214
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,343
Sure got some ugly janitors
in this dump.

215
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,942
- Who let the hooker in?
- Fuck you.

216
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,509
I did.

217
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:22,180
You deal with your mess.

218
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,888
I've got a garbage truck with my name
on it waiting for me.

219
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,658
Call me.

220
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,687
It was CIA this time.

221
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,256
Please listen to me.

222
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,166
Look, I'm a courier.

223
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,431
My contact was
assassinated right in--

224
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,598
Cross:
In private.

225
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:37,971
Woman:
This time it was CIA.

226
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:40,203
-( Men jeering )
- Look, I'm not bullshitting you.

227
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,405
I'm trying to tell you
that if you don't listen to me,

228
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,573
if you don't help me,
then I'm dead. I'm--

229
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:47,550
Cross: You just gotta stop talking
in front of people.

230
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:52,614
Manning: Please tell me you know
what the hell you're doing in there.

231
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,555
Cross:
What's your ETA, man?

232
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,996
It's gonna be a while.

233
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,556
The prisoners are locked
and secured in block G.

234
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:06,365
I'm meeting the team.
I've got something to run by Bradley.

235
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,738
Radio me if the transfer unit
shows up.

236
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:11,763
Will do.

237
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,737
Well, fuck me.

238
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,383
Man, we ain't never getting out
of here at this rate.

239
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,751
I'll take a look.

240
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:58,548
Man over radio: Target in place.
Commence extraction.

241
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,183
( Blues music playing )

242
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:10,063
Man: Come on, boss,
have a drink.

243
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:12,864
These ladies have been waiting
for you and Manning all day.

244
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,898
Oh, thank you.

245
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,001
Cross: Where the hell is Bradley?
I gotta get back to the base.

246
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,148
Bradley: Hey, sorry I'm late.

247
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,480
So where's Manning?

248
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:29,110
I thought he was
coming with you.

249
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,712
He's fucking around with that
trash compressor or some shit.

250
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:34,223
And he's happy about it too.

251
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:38,758
Sol heard you might have
something for me.

252
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,957
I've got a kite

253
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:44,229
that they seem to have recovered
from one of the inmates,

254
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:47,829
but I got a funny feeling that this
looks like numeric and Arabic mixed.

255
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,396
And Arabic is your deal,

256
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,966
so have a look at that
and I'll come down in a minute.

257
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,138
Yeah, that's exactly
what it is.

258
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,479
As you know,
ciphers are numeric-based,

259
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,506
but the Arabic is unusual.

260
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,850
Fortunately, it's one of
my specialties.

261
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,164
Hey, the wagon
finally arrived.

262
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,459
Looks like we're out of here
in the morning.

263
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:32,046
Control unit to Manning:
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

264
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:38,115
Control unit to Manning,
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

265
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,952
Man: Manning is still working
on the crusher.

266
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,049
I'll let him know
when he comes out.

267
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,855
Guard:
Let's get Terrence on it.

268
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:46,886
Terrence, this is Control.
We need you in intake.

269
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,693
The transfer unit
is here. Copy?

270
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,892
Terrence:
On my way.

271
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,492
Wait here.

272
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,546
( Blues music playing )

273
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,129
It's complicated,
but my best guess is

274
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,827
that a dirty guard
has been passing on information.

275
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,960
That's basically an itinerary.

276
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:29,336
It gives the exact pickup time
and the route the marshals are going to.

277
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:31,568
Okay, so what
we're talking about

278
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,406
is a high-risk extraction
in the making,

279
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:36,139
and it's coming soon.

280
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,772
We have little time.
Where is your gear?

281
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:41,012
The gear's still at the airport.
I didn't think we'd need it.

282
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,280
Well, always gotta be ready,
right?

283
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:47,120
Listen, I'm gonna go brief Manning
and jump up ahead of you guys.

284
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:49,147
You guys go tack up.
Meet me there.

285
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,252
Go in the tunnels
off the motor pool

286
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,786
and nobody will see you.

287
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,492
Keep your eyes open,
your head on a swivel.

288
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,261
Okay.

289
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,291
All right, gentlemen,

290
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:01,600
we got a fucking shit sandwich
coming on real fast.

291
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,765
We need to tack up now.

292
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:05,536
- Let's go.
- All right.

293
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:09,376
-" Happy days are here... .'

294
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,403
All right,
let's see what you got.

295
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:12,938
I don't think you can handle
what I got.

296
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,473
Come on, bring it.

297
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,349
Oh, damn!

298
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:19,150
Now, see, that was pure luck.
A pro would never take that shot.

299
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:22,488
Captain Christopher Blake,
US marshal, prisoner transfer unit.

300
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:24,391
You got two female
detainees for me.

301
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,987
Man over P.A.:
Personnel, be advised,

302
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:29,658
please remember
to catalogue all boxes

303
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:32,897
according to the official
government itemized checklist.

304
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,130
How's your Friday night?

305
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,701
Yeah, this all seems in order,

306
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,214
but there's only transfer papers
for two prisoners.

307
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:48,411
That's what it says-- Samantha Mendez
and Charlotte Walker.

308
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,646
Problem?

309
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:51,483
I heard you were supposed
to move all six.

310
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,785
That's news to me.

311
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,427
Well, I can't authorize
this anyway.

312
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,396
You're gonna have to talk
to the warden.

313
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:02,523
Take Marshal Blake
to see the warden.

314
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,966
I'm gonna call Esmeralda,
see if she can stay late in the kitchen

315
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,334
and get you boys fed.

316
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,998
You two stay here.
You're with me.

317
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,211
Clear.

318
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,461
I've been through that thing
from top to bottom.

319
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:12,490
Nothing's wrong
with the crusher.

320
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:14,800
Gotta be the goddamn truck.

321
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:17,170
Fire that son of a bitch
back up.

322
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:26,273
-( Knocks on door)
- What?

323
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:29,251
I said what?
ls everybody deaf around here?

324
00:24:29,274 --> 00:24:32,153
Warden, Captain Christopher Blake,

325
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:34,248
US Marshal,
Prisoner Transfer Unit.

326
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:37,192
You have two female detainees
for me to pick up.

327
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:42,758
Well, I sympathize
with your predicament, Marshal,

328
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:45,131
but it seems that nobody has
any concern for mine.

329
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:48,035
I got a schedule to keep.
You got the documentation.

330
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,595
I'm not asking you
for any favors.

331
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:53,803
The detainees are going
from a military to a federal facility.

332
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:56,472
Your paperwork requires
the correct signature.

333
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,481
It doesn't happen to be mine.

334
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:00,744
We can fix the paperwork.
Warden,

335
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:03,343
I'm working in cooperation
with the CIA.

336
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,356
They have a special interest
in these two detainees.

337
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,948
- Bring it.
- Want some of this? Huh? Huh?

338
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,583
- I don't think you do.
- Come on.

339
00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:11,821
- Oh!
- Oh. See?

340
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,023
- Want a coffee, loser?
- Yeah.

341
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,965
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey, two sugars this time.

342
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:18,160
Sure.

343
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:24,202
♪ You lift me up
and carry me away... ♪

344
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:28,405
Put in manual access,
back in a minute.

345
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,507
( Gate opens )

346
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:35,108
- Cross: D-436, anybody.
-( punches landing, men grunting)

347
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,120
This is headquarters.

348
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,645
D-436, anybody.

349
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:41,679
This is headquarters.

350
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:43,954
This is MP Terrence Davis, sir.

351
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:46,087
What's your status?

352
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:48,996
Davis: The transfer unit just arrived.
They're talking to the warden.

353
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,126
They only had the paperwork
to transfer two detainees.

354
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:54,660
Where's Manning?

355
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:57,832
Davis: Still dealing
with the garbage issue, sir.

356
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:01,275
All right, look, man, nobody moves.
Wait till I get there.

357
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,678
Do not release the PIs.
Do not release the prisoners.

358
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,704
Nobody moves
till I get there.

359
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:08,149
Davis: Copy that, sir.

360
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:13,122
Sounds like a vibrator
my wife used to have.

361
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:15,556
Keep rigging it.

362
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,660
Something's gonna snap.

363
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,925
No fucking shit.
That's the idea.

364
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,024
I want to break
whatever's in there.

365
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:26,831
I'm not staying in this
son of a bitch all night.

366
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:30,203
CIA can shove their gratitude
up their ass.

367
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:35,440
Cross signed them in
on his authority.

368
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,504
You need his signature
to get them out.

369
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,379
I'm not here
to make your life easier.

370
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,885
Boy, you got that right.

371
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,518
So where the fuck are they?

372
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,188
(song continues on radio)

373
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:55,789
(humming along)

374
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:00,993
Hey.

375
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,198
Put the coffees down.

376
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:05,538
Sit in the chair and open
the doors I tell you to open

377
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:08,407
when I tell you to open them,
and nobody gets hurt.

378
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,074
Fuck you.

379
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,878
What? Wait, no.

380
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:15,680
(gunshot)

381
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:26,727
Begin phase two.

382
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:28,253
That's our signal.
On your feet.

383
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:30,789
Light it up.

384
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:39,265
( Chuckles )
It's working again.

385
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,037
Ready to charge now.
Everyone stand back.

386
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,140
Charge, one minute.

387
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,086
What's that noise?

388
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:25,978
Time to charge.

389
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,489
Ready?

390
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,991
Fire in the hole.

391
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:30,492
Fuck.

392
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:32,825
Password, password, password.

393
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,852
What the fuck is the password?

394
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:42,499
It's inside the crusher.

395
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:48,771
- Man: Clear the blast zone.
- Clear!

396
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,938
Get down.

397
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,223
This is Terrence, sir.

398
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:03,624
I don't know about Manning,
but I just heard an explosion.

399
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,821
(siren wailing)

400
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,165
Secured?

401
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:22,735
If the MP and the security guard
are dead,

402
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,906
then, yeah, we're secured.

403
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:26,643
Good.

404
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,959
Driver: Easy payday.
Why don't we get the girl?

405
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,865
Where are they?

406
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:50,873
I don't know what you're
talking about.

407
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:52,738
Who the fuck do you think
I'm talking about?

408
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:54,801
The two that were
brought in here last night.

409
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:58,245
Oh, yes. I can tell you.
They're in-- they're in--

410
00:29:58,269 --> 00:29:59,771
Where are they,
God damn it?

411
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:01,545
Cross reopened block D.

412
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:03,574
Block D.

413
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,781
Light up cell block D.

414
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,188
I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

415
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:09,623
COPY-

416
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,492
It's that way.

417
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:20,400
Control, can you see us?

418
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:26,969
I see you. Hold.

419
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,943
What's the problem?

420
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:35,213
I don't know, man. He must have
put it on manual when I came in.

421
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,241
I need the fucking password.

422
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,616
I need your password
to open doors.

423
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:43,216
I don't have a password.

424
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:45,557
Then I'm gonna find
someone who does.

425
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,927
Please, no.
Control room-- in the control room,

426
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:50,296
there's a fingerprint scanner
on the board.

427
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:53,461
It gives me access to all
the sensitive systems in an emergency.

428
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,936
Warden:
What are you gonna do?

429
00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:59,100
Move, God damn it.
What finger?

430
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,973
Warden: No.

431
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:03,478
- Which finger?
- No!

432
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,948
(screams)

433
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:11,983
This finger?

434
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:15,582
My finger-
you cut my finger off. Fuck.

435
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,788
- Do I need to cutoff another one?
- Please, please.

436
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:24,322
I can take you there.

437
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,494
There's 50 keys here.

438
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:28,470
I know which ones to use.

439
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:30,234
Let me show you.
It'll be faster.

440
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:32,468
Please don't kill me.

441
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:34,704
Please.

442
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,340
Suit yourself.

443
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:41,350
Blake over radio:
Control, I'm on my way.

444
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,181
I've got access to the board.

445
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:49,689
- Let's go.
- Okay.

446
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:52,783
This one MP,

447
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:55,230
This one MP,

448
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:57,233
the security guy-- Manning-

449
00:31:57,255 --> 00:32:00,236
looked like ex-special ops,

450
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:02,431
a big, bald asshole.

451
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,940
No offense.

452
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,964
Just find them.

453
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:09,205
Confirm that they're dead.

454
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,577
(siren continues wailing )

455
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,810
Here's one of them.

456
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:29,155
- That's him! Waste him!
-( rapid gunfire)

457
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,032
Secure the area.

458
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:34,229
Max, with me.

459
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:51,682
One more idiot play like that
and I'll blow your head off myself.

460
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:11,967
(steam hissing )

461
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:37,955
( door slams )

462
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:48,575
(rapid gunfire)

463
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:22,234
( bones crack)

464
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:32,779
(rapid gunfire)

465
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:38,994
( door slams )

466
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:50,031
The main gate
to the holding area is secure.

467
00:35:58,029 --> 00:35:59,770
Who are you?

468
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:02,641
Special Agent Watkins.
I have an appointment with the warden

469
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,772
about some kind of
narcotics activity here.

470
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:07,043
We're doing a high-risk
security transfer here.

471
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,573
We're gonna have to
ask you to leave.

472
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:11,143
All right.

473
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:39,170
Fields over radio: Team two.
Respond, team two.

474
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:42,582
All right, head up, Bradley.
We've got active hostiles up in here.

475
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,381
Bradley: 10-4. En route.

476
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:47,218
Fields: Team two, respond.

477
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:49,246
(two gunshots)

478
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:59,496
Fields over radio:
We have another issue.

479
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:02,766
How many parts of your job
have you managed to fuck up today?

480
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,534
Not me.

481
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:06,508
Team two
has been compromised.

482
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,510
What's the damage?

483
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:10,773
Terminated.

484
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:13,213
Got some guy coming in through
prisoner intake, came out of nowhere.

485
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:15,239
Whoa, whoa.

486
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:17,752
Fields: He's changed into full tactical.
This guy means business.

487
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:19,982
Shit. Let's go.

488
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,523
Control, we got a security expert
on the loose--

489
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,554
Manning-- conversant
in special ops.

490
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,625
He went through the south boiler.
Can you track him?

491
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,226
Fields: Don't see him.
He must be off the grid.

492
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:36,169
I need access now,
or I'm gonna start blowing doors.

493
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:37,866
And track Manning.
He's bad news.

494
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:39,897
Blake: Stand down, Collins.
That's an order.

495
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,002
Your priority is the target
in cell block D.

496
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,411
Fields, do you have a visual?

497
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:50,378
Nothing but empty cell blocks.

498
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,512
Blake: What about
the rest of the prison?

499
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:54,454
Nothing.
We have two internal MP-s

500
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:56,048
in the ultra max sector,
no threat.

501
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,855
No visual on the target.

502
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:00,829
Blake: Find her.

503
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:03,161
- It's this way.
- Let's go.

504
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:19,607
Yo, the guy from the cell blocks
is moving.

505
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:22,276
Blake: Track him.

506
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:25,219
Let me know if he stumbles
into our kill zone.

507
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:28,189
We'll isolate and extract him
after we've secured the target.

508
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:29,486
You understand?

509
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:30,719
Fields: Copy.

510
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:44,295
(engine revs)

511
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:46,934
( tires screech )

512
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,712
Cross's last radio transmit said
there were active hostiles.

513
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:02,553
At this stage, we have to assume
it's an extraction.

514
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,186
We've got minimal gear and ammo,
so we go in quiet

515
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,093
through the old
hydro-access tunnels.

516
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,893
We make every shot count.
We good?

517
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,797
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

518
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,192
Blake: Come on.

519
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:18,736
( Door buzzes )

520
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:21,368
Intel on the target.
What the fuck happened to you?

521
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:24,538
They needed some convincing.
Target confirmed.

522
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,343
The location of the data
is unknown so far.

523
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,849
Shit.

524
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:36,155
Open the doors to L block.

525
00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:41,857
( Buzzes )

526
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:43,695
We have guests.

527
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:45,997
Blake: Fuck.

528
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:49,602
Ready? Three, two one.

529
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:58,035
Who the hell are those guys?

530
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:01,774
Who the fuck are they?

531
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,876
Cross and Manning
were waiting for a team,

532
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:05,751
the HSO team
I think they called it.

533
00:40:07,044 --> 00:40:10,025
Why were they waiting for
a high-speed operating team?

534
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,459
Cross-- that's the guy in holding-

535
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:16,397
he's a private contractor,
trains teams like that,

536
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,627
one of those shadow guys,
ex-Special Forces.

537
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,330
He came in to shut down the site,
brought in Manning.

538
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,563
Collins, we have an intrusion
in the motor pool--

539
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:27,872
a three-man HSO team.
Stand by.

540
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:29,673
I'm gonna shut off the power
in the cell blocks.

541
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,180
Get your people in there now.

542
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:33,704
Collins: 10-4.

543
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:36,217
Team one, sweep sector seven,
kill everyone.

544
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,117
Teams two and three,
set up perimeter defenses.

545
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:40,679
My team, tight to me.
Let's move.

546
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,831
(device squealing )

547
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:03,972
Motherfucker.

548
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:05,996
Boo.

549
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,533
God damn, it's getting funnier
every time I do it.

550
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,209
Yeah, well, see if I come to save
your ass next time.

551
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:13,442
Save my ass?

552
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,472
Fuck.

553
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:19,611
Well, I'm glad to see
you're still breathing.

554
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:22,180
- So what have we got?
- I made contact with those assholes.

555
00:42:22,212 --> 00:42:24,055
They're after one of
the female detainees.

556
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:26,425
Sounded like she had some info
somebody wanted.

557
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,090
- So where's Cross?
- Fucked if I know. He's not with you?

558
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,531
No, he said he'd meet us
up here.

559
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:34,192
They'll be going after him.

560
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:36,329
We need to assess
enemy strength,

561
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,670
engage, kill,
clear access for him.

562
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:41,266
He'll find us.
You got gear?

563
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:42,709
Not much.

564
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,371
Hand it over.

565
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:46,438
A little more effective
than a screwdriver.

566
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,972
A screwdriver worked on you,
didn't it?

567
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:49,609
Yeah.

568
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,642
You need to wake up.

569
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:58,086
No sign of him.
Hallway clear.

570
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:59,685
Go, go.

571
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:18,235
They're gonna sweep past
on a perimeter check.

572
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,077
They know we're here.

573
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:25,014
We need to get off this video grid
and buy some real estate.

574
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:26,885
Move.

575
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,467
Hold up.

576
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,875
Man: I think I see something.

577
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:51,402
Manning: Contact, 12.

578
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:54,006
Man: I hear them. They should be
right through this door.

579
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,951
(gunfire)

580
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:00,245
Man: Move it!

581
00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:22,936
Clear.

582
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,860
Clear. Dead check.

583
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:40,293
Okay, stay tight.

584
00:44:43,187 --> 00:44:45,861
Grab the radio.
We can track their movements.

585
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:47,891
Got it.

586
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:57,843
-( Steam hissing )
-( rhythmic banging)

587
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:03,911
Got Cross again.

588
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:07,714
You said these guys were
ex-Special Forces?

589
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:09,087
Yeah.

590
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:11,820
The background is
Cross is an operational genius

591
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:15,421
and Manning's a weapons expert,
a bulldozer on the ground.

592
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,324
I guarantee
when they find each other,

593
00:45:18,355 --> 00:45:20,357
we'll be facing
a coordinated assault.

594
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:25,299
Collins, you have got
to ramp it up and get it done.

595
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,775
Divert more men
to sector seven now.

596
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:32,174
Collins: There's no MPs.
Where are the prisoners?

597
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:33,704
Fields: Should be
near the door.

598
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:44,581
They're not here.

599
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:47,595
Please, no, no, no.

600
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:51,790
Tell me where she is,
or I'm done being nice.

601
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:54,803
Oh, God, I don't--

602
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:57,101
I overheard Cross and Manning

603
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,607
on the radio, a security thing.

604
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,509
Because of the garbage truck,
they must have moved them.

605
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:06,408
Where? Where?

606
00:46:06,436 --> 00:46:09,383
There's only one other
open block.

607
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,692
G block, go.

608
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:35,837
(metal groaning)

609
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,716
Terrence, are you still there?

610
00:46:50,747 --> 00:46:52,954
Terrence: Yes, sir.
Do you want me to meet you?

611
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:56,157
No, sit tight and keep your head down
or it will probably get blown off.

612
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:01,925
Copy that.

613
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:10,211
- Esmeralda, come on.
- What's going on?

614
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:12,406
- We have to hide, come on.
- No. No.

615
00:47:12,436 --> 00:47:14,279
We have to stay low.
You have to stay quiet.

616
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:17,046
- Okay, this way, then. This way.
- No, no, this way, come on.

617
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:19,281
- Let go of me.
- Esmeralda, look,

618
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,619
I will keep you safe.
I promise.

619
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:22,988
- Okay?
' Okay

620
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:24,515
Come on.

621
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:28,518
There you go. Shh.

622
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:05,328
(distant gunshot)

623
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:07,528
(distant rapid gunfire)

624
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:13,001
( men shouting )

625
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:50,900
Man: Where are you going?
What's going on?

626
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:53,848
Man: Where are you going?
What's going on?

627
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:06,520
Sorry.

628
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,689
I just didn't want
any friendly accidents.

629
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:11,996
Cross, it's me.

630
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:15,328
What's going on?

631
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,634
It's a targeted extraction.

632
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:19,231
They're killing
anybody they see,

633
00:49:19,262 --> 00:49:20,764
so we want to kill them
first, you hear?

634
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:23,573
- So we should get the hell out of here.
- Negative.

635
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,308
If somebody comes,
I'll lay down cover fire

636
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:28,577
- and buy you time.
- Do it.

637
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:36,523
All right, watch your
partners' backs.

638
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:38,651
They're gonna try to track me
on security cams,

639
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:42,186
so if you can pin them down,
buy me some time.

640
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:49,670
Man: Hey, what's going on
out there?

641
00:49:49,693 --> 00:49:53,106
( Pounding )
Fuck, what's going on?

642
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:55,439
Man: What the hell?

643
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:57,741
( Men continue shouting )

644
00:50:13,116 --> 00:50:15,858
Jesus, finally.
You took long enough.

645
00:50:15,886 --> 00:50:19,265
I went over your file.
I've been in this game long enough

646
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:21,326
to know that someone
has phonied it up.

647
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:22,769
You still think I'm crazy?

648
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:26,672
Which means probably
someone wants you dead.

649
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:29,973
If you listen to me,
do what I say,

650
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,538
I'll kill them
before they kill you, you hear?

651
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:44,649
Now, I don't know exactly
how you fit in this picture.

652
00:50:44,681 --> 00:50:48,857
I'm assuming either you're
with them or you're with me.

653
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:51,832
The long and the short is,
do what I say,

654
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:55,234
be smart-- you'll do well.

655
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:57,260
If you don't listen to me

656
00:50:57,294 --> 00:51:00,537
and I find for one reason
or another you're with them

657
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:02,566
or you make a false move,

658
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,840
I'll kill you
just like I kill them.

659
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:06,643
We cool?

660
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,206
All right, come on over
to my left.

661
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:11,185
You stay on my right,
stay a little bit behind me,

662
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:13,346
and let's go.

663
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:58,027
(rapid gunfire)

664
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:16,707
You three, with me.

665
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,913
You two, take out the MP

666
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:21,286
and sweep the block
for the target. Go.

667
00:52:31,354 --> 00:52:32,924
Man: Section G clear.

668
00:52:32,956 --> 00:52:35,630
Open all the doors in G block.
Lock everything else down.

669
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:37,434
I want my men to have
a clear run in there.

670
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,098
Warden: You can't do that.

671
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:41,735
That sector houses high-risk detainees.
You can't let those animals out.

672
00:52:41,765 --> 00:52:43,904
- Blake: Do it.
- You got it.

673
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:46,812
( Buzzes )

674
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:00,692
( laughs)

675
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,818
So what's your story?

676
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:29,881
I'm a courier for
a non-US intelligence agency.

677
00:53:29,913 --> 00:53:33,258
Sometimes I work with friendlies
and sometimes enemies,

678
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:35,593
but all of it
off the official radar.

679
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:39,464
My contact on my last drop
was a CIA op.

680
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:43,371
So how did you get here?

681
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:46,067
Well, my contact
was assassinated

682
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:49,202
and then all channels
went dark.

683
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:51,769
I got away
and then I got picked up.

684
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,815
And then I ended up here.

685
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,410
Now I got one message
from my handlers-

686
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:02,389
to sit tight because there was
some kind of internal problem--

687
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:04,619
and then nothing.

688
00:54:06,015 --> 00:54:09,053
We'll talk about that.
Let's keep moving.

689
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:21,274
Cross: Hold up.
Don't move. Don't breathe.

690
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:29,344
(device squealing )

691
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,257
What's up?

692
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:44,857
Mines. Cut one of the beams,
they go off.

693
00:54:44,888 --> 00:54:47,129
We can't go that way.
Follow me.

694
00:54:49,893 --> 00:54:53,568
Man: Corridor six clear.
Heading to the rendezvous point.

695
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:21,399
(rhythmic banging)

696
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,604
So do you know
who killed your contact?

697
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:33,443
It felt like a CIA kill squad.

698
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,915
I've seen them do the thing
a dozen times. It was classic.

699
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:38,249
So they were trying to isolate you
and retrieve information.

700
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:40,276
What are you carrying?

701
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,483
You tell me.
You know the drill.

702
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:44,116
They don't tell me anything.

703
00:55:44,147 --> 00:55:46,855
They upload the information
onto an implant.

704
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,090
It's usually
military intelligence.

705
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:50,188
Where's the implant?

706
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,962
It's right there.

707
00:55:54,023 --> 00:55:55,661
Yeah, I've seen those before.

708
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:58,969
You can upload and download data
via a short-range transmission,

709
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:02,408
but the chip also monitors
the electrical impulses of your heart.

710
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:06,808
The problem is

711
00:56:06,836 --> 00:56:09,510
if you get killed,
it wipes the intel.

712
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,644
Are the police at least
gonna come and help us?

713
00:56:14,677 --> 00:56:18,124
Sweetheart, this is a top secret
military dark facility.

714
00:56:18,147 --> 00:56:20,525
The police do not know
about this place,

715
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,154
never could, never will.

716
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:25,359
But you don't have to worry, 'cause
if somebody tries to come and kill you,

717
00:56:25,388 --> 00:56:27,925
they gotta come through me
and my friends.

718
00:56:27,957 --> 00:56:29,959
What's that noise?

719
00:56:29,993 --> 00:56:32,030
Pipes, man. They run
all the way through the prison.

720
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:34,063
The inmates use them
to communicate.

721
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:35,735
I have an MP held up
in the kitchen.

722
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:37,767
He's trying to let us know
he's all right.

723
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:42,513
Man: Hey, boss man.

724
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:44,779
Charlotte, get over here.
Now get down.

725
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:46,809
Hey, boss man.

726
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:49,414
We know you got some women back there.
Just give us one.

727
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:51,447
We'll take our frustrations
out on her.

728
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:55,691
Or you could fuck her yourself
and just give us your keys.

729
00:56:55,718 --> 00:56:57,288
Cross: I got a better idea.

730
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,561
Why don't you fuck your mama
and one of your pet poodles?

731
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:01,262
(gunfire)

732
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,398
They found the weapons.

733
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:29,551
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

734
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,456
You fucking pussy.

735
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:48,402
I have the asset and confirmation
of the chip implant and location.

736
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,842
Cross is
right behind me.

737
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:52,904
Get to the extraction point.

738
00:58:52,935 --> 00:58:54,812
How do you want me
to do that? I'm lost.

739
00:58:54,837 --> 00:58:57,977
You see where she is? What's
the quickest way to the garbage room?

740
00:58:58,007 --> 00:59:00,487
It's hard to say.

741
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,514
If you want to keep on breathing,
you'd better figure it out.

742
00:59:03,546 --> 00:59:05,958
From where she is,

743
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:07,984
she'd have to go
through the kitchen

744
00:59:08,017 --> 00:59:10,190
and then skirt B and C blocks.

745
00:59:12,121 --> 00:59:14,123
Collins, we have the asset.

746
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:17,297
She's being pursued by Cross
towards the kitchen in your sector.

747
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:19,397
Take out Cross,
rendezvous with Charlotte,

748
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,841
and get her
to the extraction point.

749
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:24,310
Rendezvous with Collins in the kitchen.
We'll open the doors.

750
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,335
Head to the kitchen.

751
00:59:53,062 --> 00:59:55,975
Happy to see a familiar face?

752
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,678
Manning, contact, 12.

753
01:00:31,601 --> 01:00:32,773
Pull back.

754
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,249
Pull back.

755
01:00:40,977 --> 01:00:43,082
Hold your fire.

756
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:53,094
Having fun yet?

757
01:00:53,122 --> 01:00:54,726
Fuck, I'm having a blast.

758
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:57,533
We've been clearing these
motherfuckers as we find them.

759
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,666
They're heading for the kitchen.
You want to hit that bitch together?

760
01:01:00,696 --> 01:01:02,972
I'd love to, but unfortunately
they're too mobile.

761
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:05,001
She'll be gone
before we get there.

762
01:01:05,034 --> 01:01:06,980
I need to hit
the control room.

763
01:01:07,003 --> 01:01:09,244
Now I can track her
from there.

764
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:11,377
We've got time,
'cause they can't kill her yet.

765
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:13,478
Clear.

766
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:15,921
Another little problem-

767
01:01:15,945 --> 01:01:18,755
we have one of the MP-s
held up in the kitchen

768
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,624
and the bad guys
are headed that way.

769
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,494
Shit. Poor motherfucker
ain't got a chance.

770
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:26,966
- Let me see what I can do.
- Yes, sir.

771
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:29,026
You guys, I want you
to sweep up the rear,

772
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:31,129
make sure Manning's six is clear.

773
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,766
I'll radio when I hit the target.

774
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,033
All right, let's do it.

775
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:49,955
Do you think anyone heard
your signals?

776
01:01:59,188 --> 01:02:01,464
- ( Whispers )
- No, wait.

777
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:11,902
Blake: Kitchen, I have movement
by cold storage.

778
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:26,449
( Rustling )

779
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,034
-( Esmeralda screams)
- Shut up. Bring them over here now.

780
01:02:42,932 --> 01:02:45,037
It's Terrence-- an MP.

781
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,982
Tell Cross and Manning
everything is clear down here.

782
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,887
Tell them you have the girl.

783
01:02:59,749 --> 01:03:02,855
This is Terrence.
We are in the kitchen.

784
01:03:10,226 --> 01:03:12,672
Terrence: It's a trap.
Mayday, Mayday!

785
01:03:12,695 --> 01:03:15,642
- No!
- ( two gunshots)

786
01:03:47,229 --> 01:03:49,402
Collins:
We have the asset.

787
01:03:49,432 --> 01:03:53,107
Blake: Get her out of the kitchens.
Send her to the extraction point.

788
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:55,137
Collins: Copy that.

789
01:04:06,982 --> 01:04:09,986
Blake: Contact,
I have movement.

790
01:04:13,622 --> 01:04:16,034
Looks like Manning's coming
through your sector.

791
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:17,093
Where?

792
01:04:23,999 --> 01:04:25,842
Blake: I lost him.
He's got to be there somewhere.

793
01:04:25,868 --> 01:04:27,870
Extraction in 10 minutes.

794
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,905
Fan out.

795
01:04:29,939 --> 01:04:33,079
Mess with me, I'll gouge your
eyes out with my fingers.

796
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:25,262
(screams)

797
01:05:53,055 --> 01:05:55,433
(screaming )

798
01:06:19,348 --> 01:06:20,918
(two gunshots)

799
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:07,593
Make a noise, you die.

800
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:41,898
Hey, are you okay?

801
01:08:51,266 --> 01:08:53,268
You like that shit?

802
01:08:55,237 --> 01:08:56,978
What the fuck, baby?

803
01:09:22,665 --> 01:09:25,009
Holy shit.

804
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:27,241
My kind of woman.

805
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:50,163
( Gasps )

806
01:09:50,192 --> 01:09:53,036
You think you're going to enjoy
yourself, baby cakes?

807
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:55,303
I don't.

808
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:57,901
- ( Screams )
- I'm gonna take good care of you.

809
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,140
No! No. No!

810
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:04,211
No. No!

811
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,912
Shut up, bitch!

812
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:11,448
Please stop.
Please stop.

813
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:17,428
You're gonna-
you're gonna like it.

814
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:18,625
Oh, yeah.

815
01:10:18,654 --> 01:10:20,656
No!

816
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,028
( laughs)

817
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:29,198
Blake:
Where's the asset?

818
01:10:29,231 --> 01:10:32,007
We've been in here too long already.
We have to move.

819
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:34,537
Working on it.

820
01:10:38,774 --> 01:10:41,277
No. No.

821
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:44,981
Come here.

822
01:10:45,013 --> 01:10:48,654
(Samantha exclaiming)
No. No. No.

823
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,902
Hey, fuckhead, over here.

824
01:11:00,996 --> 01:11:02,498
Fresh meat.

825
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:27,865
Yes, bitch?

826
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:46,453
(screaming )
Bitch!

827
01:12:47,236 --> 01:12:49,614
Back to business.

828
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:02,853
I'm gonna give you something
to think about.

829
01:13:02,885 --> 01:13:06,628
See, you're lucky. I was gonna
kill you and cut the chip out.

830
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:08,999
But now I know
I can't do that.

831
01:13:09,024 --> 01:13:12,631
It's a good thing I didn't
fuck up Cross before I found out.

832
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:14,868
So you're not gonna die just yet,

833
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:17,878
not before I get that data
scanned out of you.

834
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,402
When I do,

835
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:22,347
guess where
I'm gonna stick this?

836
01:13:27,276 --> 01:13:29,415
( Stick clatters )

837
01:13:29,444 --> 01:13:31,856
Got the bitch.
What's the situation?

838
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,884
Let's bounce.
Open everything-- all doors.

839
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:39,059
Get out of there and meet me
at the extraction point with the asset.

840
01:13:40,455 --> 01:13:42,799
Garbage room-- show me.

841
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:44,497
Now.

842
01:13:44,526 --> 01:13:46,904
Come on, come on.

843
01:14:04,313 --> 01:14:07,624
I should have known you were a plant
when they picked you up from state pen.

844
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:10,858
No con fights like that.
You're goddamn CIA.

845
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:12,058
So what if I am?

846
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:13,862
So you're supposed to be
on my side.

847
01:14:13,889 --> 01:14:16,028
Says who?

848
01:14:16,058 --> 01:14:18,402
My contact was CIA.

849
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:22,401
Why are you doing this?

850
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:24,604
We both want the same things.

851
01:14:24,633 --> 01:14:26,271
We're both helping
our countries-

852
01:14:26,301 --> 01:14:29,874
No, you just want to feel good
about yourself and I want to get paid.

853
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:31,782
You're so fucking dumb,
you didn't even know

854
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,447
what you were handing your contact
before we capped him.

855
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:36,649
If you did, you'd be lying
on a beach somewhere by now

856
01:14:36,678 --> 01:14:39,215
with a different face,
laughing at all of us.

857
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:41,523
Too bad for you.

858
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,052
Come on.

859
01:15:14,983 --> 01:15:17,395
Manning over radio:
Cross, they have the target.

860
01:15:17,419 --> 01:15:19,057
Cross: Rendezvous
with the team.

861
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,897
We'll meet up at the extraction point
in the garbage room.

862
01:15:35,737 --> 01:15:39,685
Charlotte, where are you?
Let's go. I want that package.

863
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:44,186
Getting there. They didn't give me
a map when they booked me in.

864
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,590
This wasn't supposed
to be my job.

865
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:51,159
Look, you hit F block,
then C block.

866
01:15:51,186 --> 01:15:52,688
Let's move it.

867
01:15:55,023 --> 01:15:56,058
Move it.

868
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,779
What the fuck
happened to you?

869
01:16:06,802 --> 01:16:10,306
Got my ass whupped
by my new girlfriend.

870
01:16:10,338 --> 01:16:13,217
They acquired the target.
Cross will be tracking her.

871
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:15,619
The extraction point
is the garbage room.

872
01:16:15,644 --> 01:16:17,954
Cross wants to lock down
all the doors,

873
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:19,515
contain the extraction team.

874
01:16:19,548 --> 01:16:22,654
You have five minutes to meet up.
Use what you can to get out.

875
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:25,221
I'm gonna circle around the back, make
sure they don't hit us from the rear.

876
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:27,096
- All right, got it.
- Move.

877
01:16:27,122 --> 01:16:28,829
Boys.

878
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:02,131
( Keyboard keys clicking )

879
01:17:02,157 --> 01:17:04,569
Cross: Time to lock it up.
It's my game now.

880
01:17:08,263 --> 01:17:10,004
( Buzzing )

881
01:17:19,241 --> 01:17:20,720
( gate buzzes )

882
01:17:22,744 --> 01:17:24,746
We're trapped.

883
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:25,951
Blake: Where?

884
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:27,654
F block, covered walkway.

885
01:17:27,682 --> 01:17:29,457
I've got keys, but it's gonna
slow me down.

886
01:17:29,484 --> 01:17:31,521
Blake: We're right behind you.

887
01:17:31,553 --> 01:17:32,827
Move.

888
01:17:32,854 --> 01:17:34,856
Warden,

889
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,302
get out your goddamn keys.

890
01:18:00,582 --> 01:18:02,789
Open the fucking gate.

891
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:04,797
Why do you keep
putting your keys away, huh?

892
01:18:04,819 --> 01:18:06,321
Are you clowning around
with me?

893
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:07,958
Huh? Are you
clowning with me?

894
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:09,263
Please.

895
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,328
It's not far.

896
01:18:12,327 --> 01:18:14,307
Move it.

897
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:24,410
Whoa.

898
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,950
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

899
01:18:29,244 --> 01:18:32,453
Get to the extraction point now.
Secure the area.

900
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,426
Go, go.

901
01:18:34,449 --> 01:18:36,292
Hold it.

902
01:18:39,054 --> 01:18:40,294
Come on.

903
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:42,233
Come on, come on, Warden.

904
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,705
( Gate buzzes )

905
01:18:49,564 --> 01:18:51,635
Oh, fuck.

906
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:56,507
All right, maintenance room
should only be 100 yards from here.

907
01:18:56,538 --> 01:18:58,540
Let's start blowing doors.

908
01:19:41,216 --> 01:19:44,356
If I'm gonna die, you son of a bitch,
I'm taking you with me.

909
01:19:44,386 --> 01:19:46,263
( Gate buzzes )

910
01:19:49,457 --> 01:19:51,459
Secure the door.

911
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,062
Come on, jerk-off,
get going.

912
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:03,479
Okay, Warden,
you were great.

913
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:04,916
(two gunshots)

914
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:30,637
Charlotte: The implant is
just below her left breast.

915
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:33,043
You need some kind of
special scanner to get it out.

916
01:20:33,068 --> 01:20:35,070
Just shut the fuck up
for five minutes.

917
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:37,606
I've done this about 50 times.
I know what I'm doing.

918
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,175
Watch my back.

919
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:45,419
( Beeping )

920
01:21:01,563 --> 01:21:04,066
I am so gonna enjoy this.

921
01:21:06,301 --> 01:21:08,508
Are you gonna work out
or are you gonna fight?

922
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:10,413
I guess we'll find out.

923
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,596
( laughs)

924
01:21:58,186 --> 01:22:00,666
No pain, no gain.

925
01:22:18,206 --> 01:22:20,015
That's it. I've got it.

926
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:23,318
You traitor.

927
01:22:23,344 --> 01:22:25,017
Kill the bitch.
Let's bounce.

928
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,752
Samantha: Cross!

929
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:33,197
- Charlotte: Cover.
- Blake: Give me that.

930
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,936
Isn't that the tactical genius?

931
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:41,905
I got you outmanned
and outgunned two to one.

932
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,035
I guess you're
not so clever after all.

933
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:46,477
It ain't the amount.
It's the skill.

934
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,879
The skill the guy's got-
that's what it is.

935
01:22:48,903 --> 01:22:50,905
Save it for your girlfriend.

936
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:52,612
Want to hear
something funny, though?

937
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,881
All right.

938
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,911
See my smiling face?

939
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:59,892
It's the last thing you're gonna see
before you hit your grave.

940
01:23:08,723 --> 01:23:11,761
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

941
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:13,534
Drop your fucking weapons!

942
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:16,565
- Put them down now! Put them down!
- Drop your weapons now!

943
01:23:16,598 --> 01:23:18,305
You motherfucker, drop it!

944
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:21,143
- Drop it! Drop your weapon!
-( men shouting )

945
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:22,580
( shouts )

946
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:42,460
Cover me.

947
01:23:45,894 --> 01:23:47,737
I'm out.

948
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:49,173
Cover him!

949
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,462
You're dead, bitch.

950
01:25:04,339 --> 01:25:06,945
Keep them pinned down.
I'm gonna flank them.

951
01:25:06,975 --> 01:25:08,648
I'll catch you long.
Go, go, go.

952
01:25:28,763 --> 01:25:30,174
Motherfucker!

953
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:28,857
I got four of them.
How about you?

954
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:31,363
I got some myself.

955
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:35,463
Look at this sorry-ass bitch.

956
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,026
(chuckling )

957
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:39,628
Okay.

958
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,571
Yeah, we made it.

959
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:49,872
God damn, which one of you
motherfuckers killed my future ex-wife?

960
01:27:52,473 --> 01:27:53,918
Cross.

961
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:58,513
You're out of ammo.

962
01:27:58,546 --> 01:28:00,548
So am I.

963
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:04,594
Why don't we talk?

964
01:28:11,626 --> 01:28:14,163
We've got a lot in common,
you and I--

965
01:28:14,195 --> 01:28:16,971
Special Forces,

966
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:19,239
black ops, CIA.

967
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:20,803
No, I'm not Special Forces.

968
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:23,179
I was never Special Forces.
I was a Marine.

969
01:28:23,204 --> 01:28:25,150
Whatever.

970
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:27,744
What the hell are we trying
to kill each other for, huh?

971
01:28:27,775 --> 01:28:31,313
(throws down gun )
This isn't about patriotism

972
01:28:31,345 --> 01:28:34,588
with a flag.
This is about money.

973
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:36,322
(throws down gun )

974
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,523
You know who
Samantha's contact was?

975
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:40,362
It was a money guy.

976
01:28:40,388 --> 01:28:42,800
He delivered secret government funds
to favored efforts

977
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:45,100
in trouble spots
around the world.

978
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:48,039
He was a bag man
for the CIA

979
01:28:48,062 --> 01:28:50,064
delivering bribes
and payoffs.

980
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:52,703
And that chip that was
implanted in her...

981
01:28:52,733 --> 01:28:55,077
Yeah?

982
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:58,549
That contained secret
financial information.

983
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:00,985
With that, we could access

984
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:04,353
at least $200 million
of whitewashed money-

985
01:29:04,378 --> 01:29:06,790
clean money.

986
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:08,691
You know what you could do
with that?

987
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:13,264
You could open yourself
a free clinic in Mogadishu

988
01:29:13,287 --> 01:29:15,563
or an orphanage in Mexico

989
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,661
or a bordello in Berlin-

990
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:19,603
whatever the fuck you want.

991
01:29:19,627 --> 01:29:21,038
Right?

992
01:29:21,062 --> 01:29:22,234
Yeah.

993
01:29:22,263 --> 01:29:24,265
You and I both know

994
01:29:24,298 --> 01:29:26,778
this isn't about good guys
and bad guys anymore.

995
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:29,805
We split that money
right down the middle.

996
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:33,785
You walk away a rich guy.
I walk away a rich guy.

997
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:36,789
Maybe you really would
give me $100 million.

998
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:46,591
There's your act of good faith.

999
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:49,500
You know, I'm just thinking
to myself

1000
01:29:49,523 --> 01:29:53,061
that somewhere

1001
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:55,506
in the back of my mind,

1002
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:57,839
I kind of feel like

1003
01:29:57,865 --> 01:30:01,642
you're not being
completely sincere.

1004
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,948
What, you don't trust me?

1005
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:12,924
Not exactly.

1006
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:05,241
Look at you, man.

1007
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:07,507
You're dead.

1008
01:31:08,536 --> 01:31:11,847
Money can't buy life.
Money can't buy honor.

1009
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,077
You ain't got shit.

1010
01:31:16,477 --> 01:31:19,117
I don't know what's wrong
with you, man.

1011
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:22,783
Now you're dead.

1012
01:31:23,918 --> 01:31:26,455
Argh! Jeez.

1013
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,398
You talk about
being a warrior.

1014
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:33,405
How does a warrior
break his word of honor?

1015
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:38,407
You know the story about
the scorpion and the frog?

1016
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:40,036
- Yeah.
- Well, that's me.

1017
01:31:40,067 --> 01:31:41,808
I'm the fucking bad guy.

1018
01:31:41,836 --> 01:31:43,338
Yeah? Well, I'm the good guy.

1019
01:32:08,562 --> 01:32:10,906
Hi.

1020
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:13,138
You all right?

1021
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:22,443
(Cross laughs)

1022
01:32:40,461 --> 01:32:43,806
Make sure that's set right.
Got a long trip.

1023
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:49,143
Well, I need a minute
with you, brother.

1024
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,172
Yeah, I got a minute.
What you got?

1025
01:32:51,205 --> 01:32:53,651
You know, this whole thing
was about money-

1026
01:32:53,674 --> 01:32:55,676
$200 million.

1027
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:59,350
I got the bank accounts
with all the numbers right here.

1028
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:02,554
It's all black ops money,

1029
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,927
all off the books.

1030
01:33:04,952 --> 01:33:07,262
Ain't nobody to give it back to.

1031
01:33:07,288 --> 01:33:09,290
I'm giving you half.

1032
01:33:10,825 --> 01:33:12,702
What do you want to do
with it, man?

1033
01:33:12,726 --> 01:33:16,173
Shit, probably use half of it
for some paybacks.

1034
01:33:16,197 --> 01:33:19,178
Yeah, I'd like that myself.

1035
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:24,006
Maybe use the other half
to start up a security company,

1036
01:33:24,038 --> 01:33:26,484
buy some toys.

1037
01:33:26,507 --> 01:33:28,180
What the hell
are you gonna do?

1038
01:33:28,209 --> 01:33:32,021
I think I'll give half
to St. Jude's in Memphis.

1039
01:33:32,046 --> 01:33:34,424
The other half I'll use
to have some fun,

1040
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:37,224
help some of my friends
and my family.

1041
01:33:38,452 --> 01:33:41,023
Listen, in about 43 hours, man,

1042
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:42,728
after you finish your thing,

1043
01:33:42,756 --> 01:33:44,793
I was hoping you could meet me
in Port D'Azul.

1044
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,361
You know that place,
don't you?

1045
01:33:46,393 --> 01:33:49,169
Yeah, I know the place.

1046
01:33:49,196 --> 01:33:51,574
It's where we used to do
the mission debriefs.

1047
01:33:51,599 --> 01:33:54,273
What the hell are you
cooking up now?

1048
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:56,907
I got another operation for us.

1049
01:33:56,937 --> 01:33:59,008
I think you're gonna like it.

1050
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:01,041
Remember, man,

1051
01:34:01,075 --> 01:34:04,079
it ain't over till we're dead.

1052
01:34:08,883 --> 01:34:11,864
I hope you like to fly, baby,
'cause it's time to go.

1053
01:34:41,949 --> 01:34:44,225
( Instrumental music playing )

1054
