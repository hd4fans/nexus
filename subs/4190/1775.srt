1
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,130
你是要米奇也来吗
Are you gonna... You bringing Micky in?

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,130
1993年  马萨诸塞州  洛厄尔

3
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,070
是的  他在这
Yeah, he's here.

4
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,150
应该叫上他  他也该一起来
He should come. He should be here as well.

5
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,300
我们以为米奇只是来回答问题
We thought that Micky is coming to answer the questions.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,520
不  说是让我们俩都上镜
No, they said it was going to be both of us.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,870
我现在正对着摄像机吗
Am I looking right into the camera here?

8
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,410
看着我就行
Just look at me right now.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,910
好吧
All right.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,090
你采访时不看摄像机吗
You're not going to look at the camera with the interviews?

11
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,940
我十二岁那年开始打拳击
I started boxing when I was twelve years old

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,560
我当时骗他们说我十八岁了
and I lied and said I was eighteen or whatever it was.

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,490
名字啥的都是假的
I had a different name and everything.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,590
我说我没打过架
I mean, I don't have any fights,

15
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,750
其实在我成为职业选手前
I've done a hundred more than that

16
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,310
打过无数次架
before I turned professional.

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,170
今天早上你说
This morning you said that...

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,840
-我们干嘛拍这个  -再来一次
- Why are we doing this? - One more time.

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,820
你想重头来一遍吗  再录一次
You want to go over it all? You want to start again?

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,290
他是我弟弟  我把所有本事都教给他了
He's my younger brother. I taught him everything he knows.

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,520
我现在还是他的教练  我们风格迥异
I'm still his trainer. I know we've got different styles,

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,450
我他妈的喜欢出其不意
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,670
就好像我还没在状态
You know, like, I'm not even there.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,370
苏格・雷就这么说过
That's what Sugar Ray said.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,300
我是他碰过的最狡猾的拳击手
I was the most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,370
迪克・埃克伦德对阵苏格・雷・莱纳德
1978年7月18日  马萨诸塞州  波士顿

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,370
1978年  在苏格・雷・莱纳德以前
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,720
我告诉过他  他打不赢我
I told him he couldn't get to me.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,440
他打不赢我
He couldn't get to me.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,380
大家都称我为洛厄尔的骄傲
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,180
大家至今都在谈论  尤其是我弟弟
Everybody still talks about it, you know, especially my brother.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,580
他一生都想从事我所做的事
His whole life he wanted to do what I did, you know?

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,930
但我们是完全不同的拳击手
But we're very different fighters.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,700
米奇是强击手  他出拳强而有力  要我说
Micky's a heavy hitter. He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,530
他的左拳威力巨大
Thunderous left punch.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,570
米奇  他简直是自虐
Micky, he takes a punishment.

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,040
我不知道他为什么这么做
I don't know why he does it.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,240
我会问他  你没事吧  他在里面奋斗
I'd say "You all right?" He likes getting on the inside.

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,770
而我则在场外支持他
I stay on the outside.

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,380
根据真实故事改编

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,290
别闹了
Come on!

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,030
迪奇
Dicky...

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,900
别闹了行吗
Would you come on?

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
别再闹了  你得帮我干完这个
Stop. You've got to help me finish this.

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,290
别闹了
Come on!

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,500
一如既往地无法预测
Unpredictable as ever!

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,480
你不用成为神探哥伦坡就知道朝哪出拳
You don't have to be Columbo to see where this fight is headed!

48
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,040
太棒了
Yeah, bam!

49
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,920
他一拳将米奇・沃德打倒在地
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

50
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,090
HBO要将我的回归  还有我弟弟下周
HBO's making a movie on me and my comeback

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,750
在亚特兰大击败绍尔・麦比的故事拍成电影
and my brother is going to beat Saoul Mamby in Atlanta next week!

52
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,610
洛厄尔的骄傲又回来了
The Pride of Lowell is back!

53
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,810
呱呱
Quacker!

54
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,810
斗士

55
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,410
谁要来点  谁要来点
Who wants some? Who wants some?

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,700
算我一份
I want a cut.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,870
怎么样
Doing good?

58
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,940
你们今天好吗
You guys having a good day?

59
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,740
你好吗
How are you?

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,490
来啊  你想怎么着  要出什么招
Come on. Come on. What you got? What you got going on?

61
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,620
卢  喂  卢・迪拜勒
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

62
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,450
你们好吗
How are you guys, huh?

63
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,560
我卷土重来了
I'm making my comeback.

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,800
马蒂  到这来
Hey, Marty, Marty. Come out here, huh?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,910
HBO要给我拍电影
HBO is making a movie on me!

66
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,620
嗨  美妞
Hey, beautiful.

67
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,730
你喜欢她吗
You got that?

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,230
压根不记得她是谁  啥都想不起来
Can't remember who she is. I can't remember shit!

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,870
加西亚
Hey! Hey, Garcia!

70
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
怎样  你还真不错啊
How are you, nice?

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,840
你怎么来的  开车吗
How'd you get here? Drive around?

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,940
喂  雷  我爱你  伙计
Hey, Ray. Hey. I love you, Ray.

73
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,180
我就这意思
This is what it's all about.

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,830
他搞错时间了吗
He make mistake?

75
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,030
没有  他会来的  我也说了
No, he'll be here. Like I said,

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,410
有时他按自己的时间表行事
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,

77
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,660
但他一旦来了  我们会很努力
but when he gets here we work hard.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
没人比他更严格地鞭策我了
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,310
他应该现在训练你的吧
He's supposed to be training you right now, right?

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,140
你怎么不去和我姐妹们聊聊
Why don't you just go talk to them, my sisters?

81
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,460
她们会絮絮叨叨让你听烦
They'll talk your ear off.

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,360
你得出钱她们才会闭嘴
You gotta pay them to shut up.

83
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,860
他可以讲迪奇是怎么帮他的
He can tell you how Dicky was helping him.

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,540
说吧  米奇
Come on, Micky.

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,520
好吧
Okay.

86
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
我们不知道迪奇在哪
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,660
你知道他在哪
You know where he is.

88
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,810
那个蠢蛋条子在这搞什么
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

89
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,620
姑娘们  迪奇呢
Where's Dicky? Girls?

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,410
-我不知道  -你今早见到他了吗
- I don't know. - You see him this morning?

91
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,470
-看到你兄弟了吗  -今早没见到
- Your brother? - Not this morning.

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,720
看妈妈  为拍电影还盛装打扮
Look at Mom! All dressed up for the movie, huh?

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,390
身材真是火爆
You are smoking hot!

94
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,160
从拳台上下来  奥基夫
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,520
我儿子迪奇才该在里面
My Dicky should be doing that.

96
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,430
迪奇不在  爱丽丝
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

97
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,550
米奇马上有场重要的比赛
Micky's got an important fight coming up

98
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,570
但他还没训练
and he's not training.

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,390
得了  别管他了
Forget about him. Never mind about him.

100
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
他没有尽到他应尽的责任
He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

101
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,910
就拿米奇来说...
Start saying to Micky...

102
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,280
这不是他的工作  好吗
He's not part of this, all right?

103
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,510
爱丽丝  他的训练方式不对
Alice, he's not being handled right.

104
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,690
我这么上镜可以吗
Did you get me coming in all right?

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,680
我要再来一遍吗
You want me to do it again?

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,020
从拳台上下来  奥基夫
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

107
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,390
-迪奇才是教练  -我是想帮忙  爱丽丝
- Dicky's the trainer. - I'm doing him favor, Alice.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
你们来这边看看
I will show you over here

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,850
这是我收藏多年的剪贴簿
these scrapbooks I have been collecting for years.

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
米奇以前总黏着他哥哥
Micky used to follow his big brother everywhere.

111
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,760
他教给了你一切吧  亲爱的
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

112
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,150
1978年我们得到与苏格・雷・莱纳德对战的机会
In '78 we got the offer to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

113
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,150
苏格・雷在马萨诸塞州

114
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,700
天哪  你们看过那片子吗
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?

115
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,840
当然了  你们是HBO的人
Well, you're from HBO,

116
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,100
那就再看一次吧  片子呢
you've got to see it again! Come on. Where's the video at?

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,380
体育节目特别播报

118
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,500
今晚  我的儿子
Tonight my son is going to

119
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,030
将出乎所有人意料  击败苏格・雷・莱纳德
surprise everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,070
相信我  我知道
Believe me. I know it.

121
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,200
苏格・雷今晚也许会有些麻烦
Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.

122
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,380
这很有可能
That's a good possibility.

123
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,730
他今天的对手是位优秀的拳击手
He comes in here against a good boxer,

124
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,730
一个出拳凶猛的年轻人
a young man who can punch,

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,320
而这次在我看来
and I would like to say at this time

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,660
他们在身体上势均力敌
that physically they're just about equal.

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,650
莱纳德倒下了  这是不是致命一击呢
Leonard is down. Let's see if that's a knockout.

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
不可思议
This is unbelievable.

129
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,940
埃克伦德就这么轻易取胜了
Eklund just walked over there.

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,960
没人知道是怎么回事
Nobody seems to know what's happening.

131
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,430
迪奇成功了
Dicky did it.

132
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,070
迪奇成功了
Dicky did it.

133
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,290
迪奇成功了
Dicky did it!

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,550
你现在不是该在训练米奇吗
Aren't you supposed to be training Micky right now?

135
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,090
没有  9点钟再说
No, it ain't until 9:00.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
迪奇  他妈的现在都11点45了
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,540
-11点三刻了  迪克  -啥
- 11:45, Dick. - What?

138
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,770
你他妈的把车停哪了  白痴
Where'd you fucking park the car, Boo Boo?

139
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,930
不是我停的  你停的
I didn't park it. You did.

140
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,610
你他妈摸摸口袋找找钥匙
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.

141
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,650
你拿着钥匙呢
You've got the keys, huh?

142
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,390
不是我停的  伙计
I didn't park it, man.

143
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,820
-没停在这  我不知道  -摸摸口袋
- Not here. I don't know... - Check your pockets, all right?

144
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,160
妈的  我跑着去  我他妈的得跑着去了
Oh, fuck it, I'll run. I need the fucking road work.

145
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,310
跑着去  你疯了吗
Road work? Are you crazy?

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,870
他很擅长跑步
He's a great runner.

147
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,850
-呱呱  -迪奇
- Quacker! - Hey, Dicky.

148
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,840
总比不来强
Better late than never.

149
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,980
看啊
Here, look.

150
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,880
警探大人在现场
Detectives on the scene...

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,180
得把这个带回去
Get to the bar with this...

152
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,140
-查清楚是怎么回事  -搞什么...
- Figure this one out, huh? - Why don't you...

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,160
等一下  我就有话直说了吧
Hold it. Hold it. Let me get this straight.

154
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,330
你们都是拳台外面
You guys are working in

155
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,420
米奇教练席上的吧
the same corner as Micky, together, right?

156
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,890
没错  他们都在我的教练席上
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner.

157
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,900
-就是这样  -好吧  这肯定...
- This is what goes on. - Okay. It must be...

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,010
你难道不用工作吗
Don't you have a job to go to or something?

159
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,720
说真的  奥基夫有他的工作
Really, O'Keefe has a job that he should be at.

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,340
是啊  奥基夫警官在这儿加班
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's working overtime here.

161
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,390
我们的对手是个老家伙
So we go at this old man:

162
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,830
犹太黑人  前任世界冠军
Jewish, black, former world champion.

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,630
我想我们做好了充分的准备
I think we've got all the bases covered.

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,020
我的弟弟  他连输了三场比赛
And my kid brother, he's lost three fights in a row.

165
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,070
他可不能这么一败涂地下去  心理上会有阴影
He can't get used to losing. It's a mental thing.

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,620
但我们会在麦比身上有所突破  是吧
But we're gonna break that with Mamby, right?

167
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,220
但愿如此  只要开始训练
Yeah, I hope. When we can train.

168
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,880
没错  训练  别浪费时间了  小米
When we train. Right. Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

169
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,560
-你还说浪费时间  -都他妈半天过去了
- Wasting time? - Half the fucking day's gone.

170
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,190
是吗  你也知道  我可是一直在等你
Yeah, half the day's gone. I've been waiting for you.

171
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,430
迅速  我们要击垮麦比  明白吗
Come on, move. We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

172
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,230
猛击对方头部
Take it out on the head.

173
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,680
头部  身体  头部  连击
Head, body, head. That's your combo.

174
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,360
头部  身体  头部  身体
Head, body, head, body.

175
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,290
这是迪奇教他的
My Dicky taught him that.

176
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,730
苏格・雷也会去那
You know, Sugar Ray's going to be there

177
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,040
为ESPN做现场解说
calling the fight for ESPN.

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,940
我打败他后就再没见过他
I ain't seen him since I knocked him down,

179
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,000
大概有十四年了吧
like, fourteen years ago or something, right?

180
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,860
动点真格的吧
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

181
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,820
别给自己丢脸
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

182
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,550
你也不想在苏格・雷面前丢脸吧
Don't want to embarrass yourself in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,820
来吧  头部  身体  头部
Come on, head, body, head.

184
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,320
这拳威武  伙计
Your punch, man!

185
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,360
这才是你的水平  这就对了
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,130
你得使出全身的力道
Use your whole fucking body now.

187
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,300
乔治的手指肥得要死  拨电话都不行
George's fingers are so fucking big he can't even dial the phone!

188
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,190
做那手势也没用  乔治
That's not helping, George!

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
-等等  我有些晕了  -啥
- Wait, I'm confused. - What?

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,890
-我也有些晕  -我们都晕了
- I'm confused, too. - We're confused.

191
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,250
-乔治是谁的爹  -你晕了吗
- George is whose father? - You're confused?

192
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,580
老迪克・埃克伦德是迪奇  朵娜  盖尔和菲丽斯的爹
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's, Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

193
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,290
-是迪克・埃克伦德  -对
- Is Dick Eklund. - Yeah.

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,650
而爱丽丝姓埃克伦德  辛蒂和凯茜也是
And even though Alice is an Eklund, so are Cindy and Cathy.

195
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,650
而乔治...
George is really...

196
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,830
-只有米奇  -不
- And Micky... - No.

197
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,680
我和米奇都姓沃德
Micky and I are Wards.

198
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,660
听着像是我和迪克・埃克伦德分开后
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund and I were separated, right?

199
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,000
乔治出现了  就是乔治
And then there was George. Just George.

200
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,460
-乔治是我男人  -乔治是咱爹
- George is my man. - George is our papa.

201
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,170
迪克之后又是乔治吗
After Dick, it was just George.

202
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,170
双关语 dick和george都用来形容巨大的老二

203
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,380
快点  过来
Come on. Come over here...

204
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,050
怎么不过去搭讪  她是个好女孩
Why don't you just go talk to her? She's a nice girl.

205
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,810
我跟她说过所有你的事
I told her all about you.

206
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,420
我不想约她  她肯定会拒绝
I don't want to ask her. She's going to say no.

207
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,850
能抗拒那美臀的诱惑吗
Can't beat that ass, can you?

208
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,750
快上  去吧  快去
Get at it. Go. Come on.

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,600
你准备就这么站着盯着我屁股看吗
Are you just going to stand there and stare at my ass?

210
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,630
你父亲也看  但他好歹和我讲话
Your father stares at my ass but he talks to me.

211
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,270
他觉得你是最棒的
He thinks you're the greatest.

212
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,060
他可没说你是新手
He didn't tell me you were new.

213
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,040
留着零钱吧  美人儿
Keep the change, doll.

214
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,750
他说你来找你的姐姐
He told me you came for you sister.

215
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,540
-这算小费吗  -没错  我给的小费
- This is a tip? - Yeah, that's my tip!

216
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,470
你知道这叮呤当啷的什么意思吗
You know what the bell says about this one?

217
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,180
下贱的小气鬼
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

218
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,960
每天都来  还给我抠门的小费
Comes in every day, gives me shitty tips.

219
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,650
好吧  你也去死
Yeah, fuck you, too.

220
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
你是铺路的吧
You pave streets, right?

221
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
是的  我也是个拳击手
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

222
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,180
是吗  听说你是垫脚石
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

223
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
我不是垫脚石
I'm no stepping stone.

224
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,790
他们利用你这种人
You're the guy they use

225
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,090
让其他拳击手踩着你往上爬
against the other fighters to move the other fighters up.

226
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,330
我之前是吃了几次败仗  但那不是我 
I've had a few tough fights, but that's not who I am.

227
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,770
下场比赛我会使出真正的势力
The next fight's going to show who I am.

228
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,020
可不  他最后还是会输
Yeah, and he's going to lose that one, too.

229
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,850
威士忌苏打  夏琳  其中一杯我请你
Scotch and soda, Charlene. And one for yourself.

230
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,350
你那性感的屁股快给我动起来...
Now move that sugar ass...

231
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,630
放尊重些  不准冒犯她
Okay, be respectful. Don't disrespect her.

232
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,530
喂  别伤了你的手  你下周还要比赛
Hey, don't hurt your hand. You've got a fight next week.

233
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,460
再说你还得用那只手擦屁股呢
Besides, you wipe your ass with that one.

234
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,600
你赶紧给我滚
Don't wait up, or I'm going

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,280
不然让我逮着在车里揍死丫的  明白
to hit you in the car, sucker, all right?

236
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,610
这下他残了
He's gonna be so lame.

237
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,670
听懂了吗
All right? All right?

238
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,200
这样才对
That's right.

239
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,160
带上你的饮料  拿上饮料
Take your drink. He's taking his drink.

240
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,690
这家伙会成为冠军
This guy's going to be champion.

241
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,540
他很棒  是很出色的拳击手
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,100
好了  等等  谢谢你的饮料
Okay? Hold on. Thanks for the drink.

243
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,450
那些跟着他的摄像机是要给他拍电影
You know those cameras are making a movie about him?

244
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,310
要在HBO上播  他怎么击败了苏格・雷
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO.

245
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,670
所以他们一直扛着摄像机跟着他
That's why they're following him around with the cameras.

246
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,590
他们要拍部关于他回归的电影
They're making a movie about his comeback.

247
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,500
是啊  大家都在谈论这事
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,580
那你是要和谁比赛
But who are you fighting?

249
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
-绍尔・麦比  -绍尔・麦比
- Saoul Mamby. - Saoul Mamby?

250
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,580
-什么人会起这种名字  -犹太黑人
- What kind of name is that? - Black and Jewish.

251
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,390
他们哪找的那么一个人
Where did they find a guy like that?

252
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,550
他可不是盖的  是前任世界冠军
He's no joke. Former world champion.

253
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,430
-前任世界冠军吗  -是啊
- Former champ? - Yeah.

254
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,960
-而我和他正好相配  -是吗
- I match up good with him, though. - Yeah?

255
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,030
-是的  -什么意思
- Yeah. - What does that mean?

256
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,110
我快熬出头了
Well, I got a light end, you know?

257
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,180
我打架很在行
I've got a reputation for brawling,

258
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,270
但我不和他打架
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

259
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,980
-我是和他打拳  -有区别吗
- I'm going to try to box him. - There's a difference?

260
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,830
当然  打架是要一决雌雄
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.

261
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,970
你一拳我一拳
I hit you. You hit me.

262
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,640
而拳击则是一场博弈
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

263
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,520
得出招制胜
Got to pick my punches to take him down.

264
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,580
我的话就是头部  身体  头部  身体连击
I'm going head, body, head, body...

265
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,670
那是什么意思
What is head, body, head, body?

266
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,130
我先攻击他头部
Well, I hit him in the head,

267
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,540
他把手举起来防卫
then his hands got to go up to protect himself.

268
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,820
那身体就暴露了  我就打他身体
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,

269
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,070
接着他手缩回来  我又去打他头部
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

270
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,170
手又去护头  我就又打他的身体
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

271
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,330
不懂拳击的人
People who don't know fighting

272
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,100
觉得冲着头部去杀伤力最大
think you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

273
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,510
但其实你该重点攻击对方身体
but you actually do more hitting the body.

274
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,470
你觉得如何  我能约你出去吗
So what do you think? Can I take you out?

275
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,440
你结婚了吗
Are you married?

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,260
没有  我要是结婚了怎么还约你出去
No, would I ask you out if I was married?

277
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,380
你把我当成什么人
What kind of guy do you think I am?

278
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,990
这种事太常见了  相信我
Happens all the time, trust me.

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,380
我不是那种人
I'm not like that.

280
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,820
我没结婚  有一个女儿
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,

281
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,790
每隔一周见她一次
I see her every other weekend.

282
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
她叫凯茜  就这样
Her name is Kasie. But that's it.

283
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,300
拜托  和我约会吧
Come on, let me take you out.

284
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,730
什么时候
When?

285
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,070
周六晚上我就从亚特兰大回来了
Saturday night I'll be back in Atlantic City.

286
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,890
这是真号码吗
Is this the real number?

287
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,760
你打了就知道
You'll have to call it and see.

288
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,090
我会的
I will.

289
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,970
周六  一起吃晚饭和看电影
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

290
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,650
你好吗
Hey. What's up?

291
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,680
米奇  还好吗
Micky, hey. How's it going?

292
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,750
我觉得萝莉现在不想见你
I don't think Laurie's expecting you right now.

293
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,280
他来这干什么  今天不是探视日  米奇
What's he doing here? This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

294
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,300
我只是想和凯茜打声招呼
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,990
今天不行  再见
It's not your day, goodbye.

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,940
是的  但我下周不在
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

297
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,670
你连你探视的日子都不要了吗
Now you're ditching the days you do have?

298
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,510
不  我有比赛  我跟你说了
No, I have a fight. I told you that.

299
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,090
-吉米  -我不想被夹在中间
- Jimmy... - I can't get in the middle.

300
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,310
我和她说不通  所以我问你  吉米
I can't talk to her, okay? So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

301
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,730
我现在想和我女儿说话
I want to talk to my daughter now.

302
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,200
-和你爸聊聊  -该死的  吉米
- Talk to your father. - God damn it, Jimmy.

303
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,320
嗨  爸爸  你会打败绍尔・麦比
Hi, Daddy. - Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

304
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,780
没错  我赢了之后呢
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that after I win,

305
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,270
就能开始赚大钱
I'm gonna start making big money.

306
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,550
我就能搬去个大房子  我们说好的
And I'll move into a bigger apartment, like we talked about,

307
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,810
这样你就能多陪我几天
so you can live with me more days, okay?

308
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,930
好极了  更大的房子
Yeah, a bigger apartment!

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
-祝我好运吧  -你可别指望他  凯茜
- Wish me luck, all right? - Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

310
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,720
你怎么能这么误导自己女儿  米奇
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

311
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,960
祝你好运  爸爸
Good luck, Daddy.

312
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,180
谢谢  凯茜  我爱你  亲爱的
Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

313
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,460
回见  宝贝
Bye, baby.

314
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,370
-他人呢  -老天  真他妈耽误事
- Where is he? - Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

315
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,110
担心个啥  有必要这么叹气嘛
Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.

316
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,540
烟喷了我一脸
All that shit in my face...

317
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,120
我知道这和我无关  我参加过很多次会面
I know it's none of my business. I go to a lot of meetings,

318
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,240
他们都说  随他去吧  让上帝做决定
and they have a saying: "Let go and let God."

319
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,210
你得随他去
You've got to let him go,

320
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,640
-小米  -他教会了我知道的一切
- Mick. - He's taught me everything I know.

321
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,510
只有他在场外才行  我一个人不行
He's been in my corner. I can't do it without him.

322
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,690
-你一个人已经做到了  -不  我不行
- You're already doing it without him. - No I'm not.

323
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,540
你当然可以
Yes you are.

324
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,460
听着  你知道他在哪
Look, you know where he is.

325
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,870
你干嘛不去接他
Why don't you just go get him?

326
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,330
你能去接他吗
Can you get him?

327
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,980
我他妈的可不去接他
I'm not fucking going to get him.

328
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,270
我们一伙人带着爱丽丝
Well are we all going to go over

329
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,140
坐着豪华汽车去接他吗  这样可不成
there in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

330
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,780
迪奇
Dicky.

331
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,170
-你妈妈来了  -啥
- Your mother's outside. - What?

332
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,790
迪奇  你妈妈来了  她就在下面
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside. She's down there.

333
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,600
说我不在
I'm not here.

334
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,560
不要  迪奇  别这样
Don't, Dicky. Dicky! NO!

335
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,340
你他妈的搞什么
What the fuck are you doing?

336
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,840
你知道我们现在得赶去机场
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

337
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,550
我们要去赶飞机
We've got a flight to catch.

338
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,780
你也知道这场比赛对我很重要
You know how important this fight is to me.

339
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,430
-别跟妈说我在这  -可她知道
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right? - She knows.

340
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,200
-在房子后面等我  -你他妈到底...
- Pick me up back at the house, all right? - Are you fucking...

341
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,760
她现在就在房子前面
She's in the driveway right now.

342
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,770
好吧  快点  她就在前面
All right, but hurry up. She's in the fucking driveway.

343
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,450
我们要赶飞机
We've got a flight to catch.

344
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,200
你在你弟弟比赛前还这样
You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

345
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,020
-你们在搞什么  -只是小试牛刀
- What are you doing? - Just trying to see what I have.

346
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,040
你打他了吗
The fuck did you hit him for?

347
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,170
你为什么逼我打你
Why'd you make me do that to you?

348
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,330
-上帝  -天哪  迪奇
- Jesus! - Oh, my God, Dicky...

349
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,110
我正要走  妈
I was on my way, Mom.

350
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,030
-你们在干什么  -没事儿  妈
- What are you doing? - No, Mom. Mom...

351
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,680
我们还是快去机场吧
Why can't we just go to the fucking airport for once, please?

352
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,480
爱丽丝  你老公怎么办
Hey, Alice, what about your husband

353
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,250
他倒地不起了
who's laying on the fucking ground over here?

354
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,820
你不扶一下你老公吗
You want to help your husband?

355
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,610
你干什么呢
What are you doing,

356
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,660
跑过来像个该死的银背大猩猩
running in here like a silverback fucking gorilla?

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,290
-我们得抓住他  -是啊  你可抓住他了
- We had to get him, didn't we? - Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

358
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,480
你看麦比
You see Mamby?

359
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,240
看到麦比的手臂是怎么抬的了吗
See how Mamby's arm comes up?

360
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,830
让他两侧留空
Leaves his side open,

361
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,330
然后就像弹球机一样打他
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

362
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,620
打得他尿血  你赢定了  小米  肯定能赢
He'll be pissing blood. No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

363
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,970
-你好  卢  -好  迪奇
- Hey, Lou. - Dicky, boy.

364
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,820
听着  伙计
Hey listen, boy.

365
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,590
ESPN就不能提供好点的房间吗
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

366
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,100
现在我倒不为房间的事儿担心
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,330
迪奇  你有更大的麻烦了
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

368
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,830
怎么了
Like what?

369
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,510
医生不允许麦比参赛
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

370
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,790
为什么
Why not?

371
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,150
-他得了流感  -麦比得了流感吗
- He's got the flu. - Mamby got the flu?

372
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,090
是
Yeah.

373
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,660
迪奇  我们还是能参赛的
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

374
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,570
-对手是谁  -麦克・穆金
- With who? - Mike Mungin.

375
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,060
麦克・穆金是谁
Mike Mungin, who's that?

376
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,520
-来自费城  坐过牢  -出来有几个月了
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison. - He's been out a few months.

377
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,640
我所有人和地方都找过了
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.

378
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,210
只能找到他了
He's the only guy I could find.

379
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,400
前三场比赛很艰难  卢
My last three fights were rough, Lou.

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,050
我以为这场会轻松点
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

381
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,040
我们训练时研究的是麦比
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

382
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,120
没错  但这家伙刚从班房里出来
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.

383
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
有好一阵子没打了
He's been sitting on his ass.

384
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,190
对米奇来说也许很轻松
Could be an easy win for Mick.

385
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,090
还记得乔伊・法雷吗  他曾把他打得很惨
Joey Farrell, remember him? He knocked his ass out.

386
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,850
而你曾把乔伊・法雷打得够呛
And you knocked down Joey Farrell...

387
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,910
没错  穆金刚从号子里出来
Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

388
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,860
还没减肥  也许有些超重
Can't make weight. Might be a bit over, though.

389
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,030
超多少
How over?

390
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,400
-162  165的样子  -165磅
- 162, 165... - 165?

391
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,470
米奇减重了  他才146磅
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

392
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,110
卢  我们为麦比备战的  明白吗
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right? We prepared for Mamby!

393
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,260
这家伙刚出来  而米奇状态正佳
This guy just got off the couch. Micky's in shape.

394
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,560
受过长跑等各种训练  而那家伙毛都没有
Road work, everything else. This other guy hasn't done dick.

395
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,790
别忘了  如果不参赛就没钱

I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

409

但这家伙是中量级

415
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,100

What, they don't have a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

416
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,780
迪奇  告诉他  他能行  他绝对没问题
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right? He can do anything.

He did not just get off the fucking couch.

429

要真是这样  我也想去那号子蹲蹲看
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

430

他想让我去拉斯维加斯训练
He wants to train me in Vegas.

You can't trust that guy, Micky. He ain't family, you know?

他需要休息  他心情很不好
He's going to go rest. He's all grumpy.

543
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,760
他累了  打输了  感觉有些丢脸
He's tired. He's beat up. He's a little embarrassed, I think.

544
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,400
谁
Who is it?

545

我看到你的影子了
I saw the shade move.

546
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,380
米奇  影子还在动  我看到你来窗前了
Micky, the shade is still moving. I saw you come to the window.

我知道你就在那

你好歹开个门
The least you can do is open up this door

549

亲口告诉我昨天为什么没给我打电话

我想打来着  就要打了  但是没打
I started to call. I was going to call. I just couldn't.

552
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,280
因为你输掉了比赛吗
Because you lost the fight?

553
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,110
也许是吧  因为我输了

这是那个黑犹太人打的吗
Did the black Jewish guy do this to you?

我没跟他打
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

564
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,800
那你为什么参赛
Why did you?

565
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,170

他们都说我能打败他
Everybody said I could beat him.

567

你真以为你的家人关心你吗

别那样说  我不喜欢

全世界却为之哭泣
which started the whole world crying.

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,390
我会哭泣
I started to cry,

659
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,620
全世界却为之而笑
which started the whole world laughing.

660
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,550
假如我知道
Oh, if only I'd seen

661
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,020
那只是在取笑自己
that the joke was on me.

662
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,040
我会仰望天际
I looked at the skies,

663
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,840
在眼前挥舞双手
running my hands over my eyes,

664
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,530
接着我跌下床
and I fell out of bed,

665
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,320
撞破头...
hurting my head...

666
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,840
你是"海狸"  你是"红熊"
So you're Beaver, and you're Red Bear.

667
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,390
"红胡子"
Red beard.

668
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,940
她是"红狗"  那是"海狸"
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

669
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,500
你是"红狗"  你是"海狸"
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

670
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,160
别叫那些名字  家里人才能叫
Yeah, don't use those names. It's just for family.

671
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,610
客气点
Be nice.

672
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,170
不要叫昵称
Don't use the nicknames.

673
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,650
那我他妈的该叫她们什么
What the fuck will I call them then?

674
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,090
说到家人...
Speaking of family...

675
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,100
你好
Hello.

676
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,940

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,270
我听过你很多事
I've heard a lot about you.

678
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,010
是吗  我也听过你很多事
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

679
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,070
-你什么意思  -和你一样的意思
- What's that supposed to mean? - Same thing you meant.

680
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,050
我们能坐下好好谈正事吗
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

681
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,390
小米  我又帮你组织了场拳赛  
I got you another fight, Mick.

682
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,250
正如我承诺过那样
Just like I said I would.

683
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,880
卢和ESPN给我们的补偿
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

684
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,680
正如我所说
Just like I told you.

685
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,930
对手是乔・梅伦克  六周后在快活赌场
Joe Melenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

686
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,690
他是个...  十二分把握  他什么都不是
He's a... Ten in eight. He's none.

687
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,570
报酬是两万美元
And they're going to pay us twenty grand.

688
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,560
准确地说是17500美元
$17,500, technically.

689
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,970
好吧  17500美元也很可观了  小米
All right, $17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

690
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,880
是啊
Yeah.

691
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,420
那是很好  迪克
That's good, Dick.

692
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,880
我只想弄清楚怎样最合适我
I'm just trying to figure out what's best for me.

693
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,580
比方说呢
Like what, huh?

694
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,410
什么最合适你  亲爱的
What's best for you, sweetheart?

695
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,400
得了吧  小米  我想你会很激动
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.

696
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,240
你怎么不激动呢
Why aren't you more excited?

697
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,390
这场比赛有把握  报酬也不错  
It's a good fight, good money.

698
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,170
我和卢・金谈好了
I got something with Lou Gold.

699
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,980
他了解我们
He knows us.

700
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,140
我知道  妈妈
I know, Mom.

701
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,340
我只是不想再这样下去
I just don't want things going the way they've been going.

702
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,390
小米  上场比赛不公平  那不公平
Mick, that last fight was unfair. That was unfair.

703
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,980
我们不会再重蹈覆辙
And we ain't going to repeat that,

704
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,280
-对吗  -绝对不行
- right? - Oh, not on your life.

705
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,540
老弟  你只要上了拳台就行
You know, buddy, it's just you in the ring.

706
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,140
是的  我知道是我上拳台
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

707
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,300
但我不喜欢这里处理事情的方式
But I don't like the way things have been going here.

708
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,400
-哪里  -哪里
- Where? - Where?

709
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,400
这里  这些  我们  洛厄尔的一切
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

710
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,240
-乔治  你别管  -都是你们在说
- George, stay out of it! - You're doing all the talking.

711
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,240
-听他说  -我是在问他
- Let him talk. Listen. - I'm asking him.

712
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,310
-你是在命令他  你听他说  -你别管
- You're telling him. Listen. - Stay out of it.

713
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,500
别这么和我说话
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

714
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,730
小米  到底是什么问题
Mick, what's the problem?

715
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,530
-很多问题  -那都是些什么问题
- Problems. - What problems?

716
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,060
-问题是...  -比如说呢
- Problems... - Like what?

717
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,150
比如说  训练时你没准时到
Like maybe you not showing up on time to train.

718
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,480
比方说  快上飞机的时候
Like maybe him having to come find you in a crack house

719
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,660
他还不得不去毒品屋找你
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

720
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,860
不好意思  我不认识你  说什么呢
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are. Why are you talking?

721
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,970
我是夏琳  我们才认识
I'm Charlene. We just met.

722
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,360
我们在一起  是不是要再来一遍  你好  我是夏琳
We're together. Do we need to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

723
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,200
-你好  夏琳  -你好
- Hi, Charlene. - Hi.

724
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,070
-你好  我是夏琳  -你好  夏琳
- Hi, I'm Charlene. - Hi, Charlene.

725
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,670
我们在一起了
Hey, we're together.

726
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,590
你想什么呢  小米
What are you going to do, Mick?

727
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,150
听个在酒吧干活的"MV女郎"瞎掰吗
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

728
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,130
她懂个屁拳击
What does she know about boxing?

729
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,970
我只知道  他们在维加斯
I know they're going to Vegas

730
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,380
能领到薪水还能接受全年训练
and getting paid to train year-round.

731
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,020
这听起来可比
Sounds a hell of a lot better than

732
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,140
你们的计划好多了
what you've got him doing here.

733
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,900
你就这样让她和你妈说话吗
You going to let her talk like that to your mother?

734
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,270
得了吧  米奇
Come on, Micky.

735
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,530
我告诉过你  我们在一起
I told you, we're together.

736
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,330
这是我女友  我想让她待这里
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

737
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,900
我所做的一切都是为了你  米奇
I have done everything. Everything I could for you, Micky.

738
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,170
结果这个MV女郎一来...
This MTV girl comes along...

739
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,260
别再叫我"MV女郎"了  不管他妈的是什么意思
Stop calling me an MTV girl, whatever the fuck that means.

740
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,140
-烂货  -荡妇
- Skank. - Wild.

741
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,440
我干这行超过十五年了
I've been doing this over fifteen years.

742
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
她来了  对我不敬...
She comes in, disrespects me...

743
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,480
她没想要对你不敬  好吗
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

744
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,540
我有机会赚钱接受全年训练
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

745
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,190
全年的  明白吗  这就是她的意思
Year-round, okay? That's all she's talking about.

746
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,270
我希望能得到你们的支持
I would hope that you guys could appreciate that.

747
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,650
我认同你的想法  好吧
I know what you're talking about, all right?

748
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,020
我能搞定
I could have had that.

749
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,600
如果你愿意  我会想办法搞定
You know, I had opportunities like maybe you're going to have.

750
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,320
你想要钱去全年训练  对吗
Now, you want money so you can train year-round? Yeah?

751
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,010
我会帮你搞到钱  你就可以去全年训练
I'll get you money so you can train year-round.

752
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,180
-你行吗  -我会去办
- You? - Yeah, I'll do it.

753
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,040
-相信我  -怎么弄
- Trust me. - How?

754
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,560
相信我  好吗
Hey, trust me, all right?

755
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,760
说定了
Done.

756
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,020
行吗  夏琳  你觉得呢  大家呢
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

757
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,870
你投入200美元
So you put in $200...

758
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,930
再找十个人每人投入200美元
Then you get ten other people to put in $200...

759
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,050
这样你就能得到2000美元
And you've got your $2000.

760
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,220
每个人给你200美元吗  
Everybody give you $200?

761
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,570
不是每个人  只是你们中的十个
No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

762
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,880
十个幸运者
Ten lucky ones.

763
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,590
-你要骗我们  -不  不是的
- You'll rip us off. - No, no.

764
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,240
-就是给你个机会  -那你给我200美元
- Give you an opportunity. - You give me $200!

765
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,290
不  你把这个机会给其他十个人
No, you get that from ten other people

766
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,010
你从他们手里赚这笔钱
who you offer the opportunity to.

767
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,480
对吗  你懂不懂
Right? You understand? No?

768
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,940
他觉得你把柬埔寨人都当傻瓜
He thinks you think Cambodian people are stupid.

769
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,750
我爱柬埔寨人
I love Cambodian people!

770
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,130
看看凯伦
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

771
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,510
她是我女朋友  她很美  我爱她
She's my girlfriend. She's beautiful. I love her.

772
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,940
还有布莱恩  我们是同事
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

773
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,140
最近不咋见了
Not so much lately.

774
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,260
布莱恩  我们是同事
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

775
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,820
我的意思是很久没见你了  
You haven't been showing up, that's what I'm saying.

776
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,450
这和柬埔寨人没关系
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

777
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,710
白人之间也常这么干
White people do this to other white people.

778
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,010
这世界就是这样
It's what makes the world go around.

779
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,070
我觉得那没什么用
I don't think that's helping.

780
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,980
这可是千载难逢的机会...
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

781
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,660
我是说他们不懂
I mean, they didn't understand.

782
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,690
他们一直看我的比赛...
They're practically on my game...

783
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,490
通常都会听我的
Usually they listen to what I say,

784
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,630
但他们不懂得抓住机会
but they just didn't understand the opportunity.

785
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,370
我是说那机会难得
I mean, it was awesome.

786
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,870
我们聊到哪了
What were we talking about?

787
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,470
-就在你和苏格・雷比赛前  -对  对  对
- Before you fought Sugar Ray. - Right, right, right.

788
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,180
苏格・雷的故事太多  发生得太快
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.

789
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,940
我得慢慢回忆
I needed to build up slow.

因为这太悲哀了  
Because it's sad that

867
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,210
你就这么被他们那愚蠢的一套随意糊弄
you let them take it away from you with their stupid bullshit.

868
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,030

916
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,730
在那之前  我本想去参加银手套联赛之类
Before that, I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

917
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,620
只有我是孩子  当时才12岁  醉得一塌糊涂
I was the only kid. I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

918
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,130
我来告诉你吸毒是什么感觉
I'll tell you how crack was.

919
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,410
它会进入你的肺  等它进去后

920
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,260
-我想看爸爸  -上帝啊
- I want to watch Daddy. - Oh, my God.

921
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,430
不行的  亲爱的  回楼上去
No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.

922
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,460
但我想看电视上的爸爸
But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

923
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,840
不行  现在你不能看你爸爸  好吗
No, you can't. You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

924
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,250
你回楼上睡觉  好吗
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

925
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,690
这是我兄弟  来看看
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

926
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,730
今天我能卖你什么  一条蟒蛇吗
What... What can I sell you today? A python?

927
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,060
好啊  拿来看看  老兄  
Yeah, check it out, man.

928
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,220
他们会替我买单
They're going to buy me some.

929
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,230
有一阵子了  现在来什么我都能行
It's been a while. I'll take anything right now.

930
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,390
从未想过我会去亲条蛇
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.

931
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,690
我倒是经常梦到  但...
I always dreamed about it, but...

932
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,510
你嗑药嗑嗨了啥破事都干过  是吧
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

933
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,930
见鬼  是的  让洛厄尔举世瞩目了
Heck, yeah. Put it all on the map.

934
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,130
你击倒了苏格・雷  你不是说过吗
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, didn't you say?

935
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,380
是的  他击倒了他  
Yeah, he knocked him down,

936
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,210
但我觉得那不算击倒
but I don't think it was a knockout.

937
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,020
我觉得他是滑倒的  
I think he slipped.

938
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,010
他击倒了他
He knocked him down.

939
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,530
-他不是滑倒  -他就是滑倒的 
- He didn't slip. - He slipped.

940
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,150
-杰克...  -得了吧
- Oh, Jack... - Come on.

941
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,670
他妈的骗人
That's a fucking lie!

942
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,740
他们说他惹上了毒瘾...
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

943
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,800
你们在干嘛  
What are you doing?

944
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,420
你是不是在诋毁我们家人
Are you talking shit about the family?

945
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,560
没  根本没有  
No, not at all.

946
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,470
我听到你们在说
Yeah. I heard you say.

947
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,810
我们不喜欢这样
We're not like that.

948
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,870
洛厄尔根本不是那么回事
This is not what Lowell is all about.

949
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,150
我原以为他会浪子回头
I thought he could make a comeback

950
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,290
成为我们的骄傲  但他没有
and make us proud, but he didn't.

951
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,160
我不知道迪奇怎么想
I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

952
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,320
让人觉得又讨厌又失望
Very disappointing. Very disgusting.

953
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,340
你让洛厄尔城倒退三十年
You brought the city of Lowell back thirty years.

954
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,310
我们很不满意
We're not happy.

955
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,040
-你好  -吉米
- Hello? - Jimmy.

956
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,190
你能不能帮我个忙  
Hey, will you do me a favor?

957
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,860
别让凯茜看HBO的电影
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

958
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,660
其实我们现在正看着  小米
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

959
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,540
但不用担心  我会处理...
but don't worry about it. I got it...

960
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,280
我就想让她看看
I want her to see it.

961
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,780
让她看看她叔叔是什么人
Let her see who her uncle is.

962
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,290
-什么  -你又是什么人
- What? - Who you are.

963
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,570
我是什么人  你说什么呢
Who I am? What are you talking about?

964
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,100
得让孩子了解真相  小米
Kids need to know the truth, Mick.

965
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,900
萝莉  求你了  快关掉
Laurie, turn it off, please.

966
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,400
她没必要看这些
She does not need to see this.

967
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,380
她没必要看到  她只是个孩子
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

968
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,030
你要是嗑了药
If you're on crack,

969
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,660
就会感到飘飘欲仙
you feel so much lighter.

970
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,280
感到青春焕发  
You know, you feel young.

971
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,870
所有的东西都那么好笑
And everything is so funny.

972
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,200
所有的东西都...
Everything is just...

973
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,530
接着所有的东西都不好笑了
Everything is... It wasn't funny.

974
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,830
接着就没感觉了  
And then it fades,

975
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,230
你会想再爽一下
then you've got to get high again.

976
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,850
你那部分电影该结束了
Your part of the movie's going to end

977
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,320
之后你就去坐牢了  
with you going to jail.

978
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,570
我们了解迪奇  我们会照顾他的吧
We know Dicky. We're going to take care of him, huh?

979
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,290
你们不能告诉他
You guys can't talk to him.

980
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,260
关掉那该死的东西  快关掉
Turn that shit off. Turn this off, all right?

981
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,470
关掉它  你关不关
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

982
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,610
你不关  那他妈的我来关
You don't turn this off. I'm turning it fucking off.

983
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,020
那是我的生活  他妈的那可是我的生活
Hey, that's my life. That's my fucking life up there.

984
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,860
-我就想看  我无所谓  -去你妈的鬼
- I want to watch this. I don't care. - I will fuck you up.

985
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,290
你他妈的欠揍吗  劝你别惹我
You fucking want some? Don't fucking try me.

986
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,490
我他妈的可还是狠角色  你是想挨揍吗
I still fucking won it, okay? You fucking want some?

987
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,010
那是我儿子  你敢嘲笑他吗
That's my son there. You're laughing at him?

988
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,580
那是我儿子  他在哭
That's my son, he's crying,

989
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,620
他需要我  而我他妈的还被困在这
he needs me, and I'm fucking stuck in here?

990
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,410
米奇  你在看吗
Micky, are you watching this?

991
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,420
他们对我们都干了些什么
What are they doing to us?

992
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,400
我不知道怎么和你说
I don't know what to tell you.

993
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,800
这些年来你都假装视而不见
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.

994
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,070
他这样都好几年了
He's been doing this for years.

995
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,660
我知道这很可怕  但是妈...
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom. But...

996
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,160
你又怎么看
What do you think?

997
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,570
你觉得是他们陷害他的吗
You think they set him up?

998
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,470
妈  你觉得他都在干嘛
Mom, what do you think he was doing?

999
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,060
是他们给他钱
You know, they gave him money,

1000
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,950
给他毒品在电影里抽  是吧
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

1001
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,590
米奇
Micky?

1002
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,140
-换了新沙袋吗  -对

1004
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,160
-这沙包怎么回事  -不知道
- What happened to the peanut? - Don't know.

1005
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,690
像个沙滩球
Like a beach ball.

1006
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,750
不错
Good job.

1007
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,080
-小米  这是萨尔・拉纳诺  -小米  最近好吗
- Mick, Sal Lanano. - Hey, Mick. How you doing?

1008
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,120
你是个出租车公司的老板吧
You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?

1009
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,460
他做生意很有一套
He's very organized.

1010
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,870
-手怎样了  -还行  挺好
- How's the hand? - It's good, you know?

1011
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,160
好多了  能用上力了
It's getting better. Stronger.

1012
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,240
我之前打了几通电话
You know, I made a few calls already.

1013
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,790
我和布迪・泰格谈过了
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

1014
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,090
他说能给安排几场地区赛
He said he can set up something local.

1015
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,450
也可以说是  复出赛
You know, something to start back with.

1016
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,810
-让你重拾信心  -没错
- Get your confidence back. - That's it.

1017
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,130
你得重整旗鼓
You've got to get your confidence back.

1018
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,800
就这意思
That's all.

1019
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,700
你爸想让萨尔做你的经纪人
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

1020
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,670
让我做教练
And he wants me to train you,

1021
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,320
但有一个条件
But he'll only do it on one condition.

1022
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,270
-不能再迁就那帮疯子  -没错
- No crazy time nonsense. - That's how it's got to be.

1023
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:07,190
-没有迪奇和爱丽丝  -没有迪奇和爱丽丝
- No Dicky, no Alice. - No Dicky, no Alice.

1024
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,220
我懂  我懂  我都明白
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.

1025
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,860
我很珍惜这次机会
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

1026
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,810
受不了那鬼扯的一套了  小米  无意冒犯  乔治
Can't take the bullshit, Mick. No offense, George.

1027
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,500
没关系  我是说
None taken. I mean,

1028
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,340
我去摆平他  大不了把他骟了
I'm going to be the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

1029
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,450
你们就笑吧
Yeah, you laugh.

1030
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,740
-你个叛徒  -你这是干什么
- You traitor! - What are you doing?

1031
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,260
你这又犯的什么神经病
What the hell's the matter with you?

1032
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
我的天
Come on!

1033
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,010
疼吗  疼死你才好
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

1034
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,800
-萨尔・拉纳诺是个好人  -好人?
- Sal Lanano is a good man! - A good man?

1035

- He's a legitimate businessman! For Christ sake. - Legitimate businessman?

1036
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,790
-怎么了  -我的老天  知道那听上去像什么吗
- What? - Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

1037
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,450
-他丫是个骗子  乔治  -他是出租车公司的老板
- He's a crook, George! - He owns a taxicab company!

-手底下有很多人  -天哪  他是个开出租的
- He's organized! - Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

1039
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,400

- He knows everything about boxing, right? - Yes.

1040
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,900
放你娘的屁
I don't think so!

1041
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,120
他是想把你儿子的钱一个子儿不剩全骗走
I think he's going to steal your son's money and rob him blind!

1042
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,910
你怎么能这么想  你为什么非要这么想
Why would you think that? Why would you even think that?

1043
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,510
-你就是不肯信任任何人  -我把人都看透了
- Why can't you trust anybody? - I know people.

1044
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,150
乔治  我知道你嫌我没见识  可我了解人的心理
I know, George. You think I don't know anything. But I know people.

1045
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,400
你可真是通情达理...
I know you know things...

1046
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,180
那什么萨尔・拉那那还是拉粑粑的
And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

1047
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,790
我们不需要他
We don't need that in our lives!

1048
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,900
孩子们跟着你根本赚不着钱
We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

1049
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,450
你背叛了我  你背叛我
You betrayed me. You betrayed me.

1050
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,810
我操  我背叛你个妹
Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

1051
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,130
-总这么说有意思吗...  -他是个大骗子
- You're always have to say... - He's a fucking crook!

1052
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,070
你想让米奇怎么办  迪奇还在监狱里
What's Micky supposed to do? Dicky's in jail.

1053
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,220
我们没说教练的事  宝贝
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.

1054
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,020
我们在说谁该当经纪人  是你娘我
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

1055
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,460
没错  可是妈  也许米奇该尝试些改变...
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should try something different...

1056
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,610
你是吃哪碗饭的  敢跟我在这顶嘴
What are you doing, opening your mouth in my kitchen?

1057
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,970
你还欠我200块呢
You owe me $200.

1058
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,640
我说了下周给你
I said I was going to pay you next week.

1059
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,350
你给我闭上你的嘴
I don't want another word out of you.

1060
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,270
你上个月就和我这么说
That was last month you told me two weeks.

1061
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,580
你吃我的  住我的  欠我的钱  还胳膊肘往外拐
Do you take sides against me in my own house? You owe me money?

1062
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,490
妈妈才是对米奇最好的  雪莉
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

1063
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:42,540
没错  谁能比妈妈更会照顾自己的儿子
Really, who's going to look after Micky better than his own mother?

1064
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,230
都是夏琳那婊子惹的祸
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

1065
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,910
我们得去除掉她  妈妈
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

1066
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,990
得去除掉她
We've got to get rid of her.

1067
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,570
都是夏琳闹的  她得滚蛋
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

1068
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,610
你们要把夏琳搅进来吗
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?

1069
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,140
你们是这意思吗
Is that what you're all telling me?

1070
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,770
-是吗  -我知道她住哪
- Huh? - I know where she lives.

1071
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,290
你们找她去干什么
What are you picking on her for?

1072
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,900
她就住斯蒂文街的一栋黄色的楼里
She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.

1073
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,300
没错  屎黄色的
Yeah, the puke yellow.

1074
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,090
我得跟米奇谈谈  我得亲自摆平这事
I'm going to talk to Micky. Sort this out for myself.

1075
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,420
-没错  带着你的城管大队去吧  -咱们走
- Yeah, sure. You go handle it with your vigilantes.  - Go.

1076
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,660
你大错特错了  爱丽丝
This is wrong, Alice!

1077
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,650
-我来开  -都别挡道  快上车
- I got it. - Get out of my way! Get in the car.

1078
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,420
快上来
Get in the car.

1079
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,500
米奇  你在里面吗
Micky, are you in there?

1080
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,310
就在二楼
Up in there on the second floor.

1081
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,450
米奇
Micky!

1082
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,450
你在哪呢
Where the hell are you, huh?

1083
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,440
你在楼上吗  快下来
Are you up there? Come on down.

1084
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,420
你在哪
Where are you?

1085
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,920
天哪  米奇  你妈带着你的姐妹团来了
Holy shit, Micky. Your mother and your sisters are here.

1086
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,170
不  不  别出去  求你了
No, no. Do not go out there, please.

1087
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,390
不  我干嘛要躲着这些疯婆子
No, I'm not hiding from your crazy fucking family.

1088
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,600
哎呦喂  瞧瞧
Well, well, well. Look at this.

1089
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,950
瞧什么
Look at what?

1090
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,220
为什么躲着我们  米奇
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

1091
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,010
-他没有  -谁跟你说话了
- He's not hiding. - I wasn't talking to you.

1092
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,800
我跟我儿子说话呢
I was talking to my son.

1093
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,240
-你站她后边干嘛  -我就在这呀
- What are you doing next to her? - I'm right here.

1094
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,860
我谁都没躲  爱丽丝
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1095
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,470
你和你爸那混账朋友拉纳诺一起没前途
Well you're not helping yourself with your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

1096
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,360
然后你想干嘛  把迪奇扔在一边吗
What are you going to do? Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

1097
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,640
我们只是想帮你成为世界冠军
All we ever wanted for you was to be world champion.

1098
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,470
米奇不是小孩子了  他能为自己做主
Micky's a grown man. He can think for himself.

1099
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,890
-闭你丫的嘴  -妖妇
- Shut your mouth. - Skank!

1100
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,300
别再叫我妖妇
Don't call me skank.

1101
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,560
小心我拔秃你的头发
I'll rip that nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

1102
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:56,400
我是他的妈妈  也是他的经纪人
I'm his mother and his manager.

1103
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,180
你不再是我的经纪人了
You're not my manager anymore.

1104
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:01,740
我也不会等迪奇出狱  我耗不起这时间了
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay? I'm not getting any younger.

1105
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:04,670
-那谁来照顾你呢  亲爱的  -我自己呀
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart? - How about me?

1106
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,200
我知道你不会懂  我有九个孩子
I know you don't understand it but I had nine kids,

1107
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,190
你们每一个都是我的心头肉
and I love every one of you the same.

1108
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,270
让他挨打  让他的手受伤  如果这就是你的爱
You've got a funny way of showing it, letting him get beat up,

1109
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,430
-那他受不起  -臭婊子  -你疯了
- letting him get his hand broken. - Bastard. - You're crazy.

1110
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,470
-臭婊子  -忘了我刚才说什么吗
- Bastard. - What did I just say to you?

1111
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,470
放开她
Let her go.

1112
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,220
操你妈
Fuck you!

1113
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,120
操
Fuck!

1114
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,120
都给我滚  快
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

1115
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,430
-去死吧  夏琳  -米奇
- Fuck you, Charlene!  - Micky.

1116
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,490
-妖妇  -有本事出来呀
- Skank! - I want them the fuck out of here.

1117
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:44,260
-你死定了  -贱人
- You're fucking dead. - Fucking bitch!

1118
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,100
盖尔  天哪  你鼻子怎么了
Gail! Oh, my God. What did she do to your nose?

1119
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,500
咱们撤
Let's get the hell out of here.

1120
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:00,170
这到底是怎么了  宝贝们  我不明白  
What's happening to everybody? I don't understand, sweetheart.

1121
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,200
沃德对阵赫尔南德兹
新罕布什尔州  汉普顿沙滩娱乐场

1122
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,930
我的名字里多拼了个E   
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"? Because I don't.

1123
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,730
-米奇・沃德  不是"米基"  -没人按电梯吗
- "No E" Micky Ward. - Hey, somebody push that button.

1124
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,730

- The ring's across the street? - Yeah.

1128
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:02,540

Smaller venue. They've got no dressing rooms over there.

1129
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,540
这是你首场比赛  米奇  慢慢来
It's a starter, Micky. Just a starter.

1130

迪奇
Dicky!

1138
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,670
听说你赢了好几场比赛  小米  真不错
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick. That's good.

1139
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,850
我知道你知道我在干什么
I know you know what I'm doing.

1140
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,230
爱丽丝什么的肯定都告诉你了
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

1141
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,700
我只想当面跟你说
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

1142
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,880
我有了新的经纪人  麦基・奥基夫现在是我教练
I've got a new manager and Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1143
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,520
一切都很好
It's going good.

1144
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,830
是呀  他们说你下场对阿尔方索・桑切斯
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

1145
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,950
-HBO台会转播  -觉得挺自豪吧
- On HBO. - Bet you're proud of that.

1146
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,330
-当然了  -HBO就善于靠墨西哥式拳击捞钱  醒醒吧
- Fucking right. - HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

1147
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,640
我没想到他们会在我身上下那么大本钱
I didn't think they were going to be invested in me.

1148
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,250
-我的机会来了  我得抓住它  -别做梦了
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it. - Wake up.

1149
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,510
他们才不管你死活
They don't care if it kills you.

1150
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:42,070
肯定是迈克・托马  他在利用你
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

1151
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,310
让桑切斯踩着你往上爬
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

1152
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,080
-你怎么就不明白  -我明白
- Why don't you see? - Oh, I see.

1153
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,610
没有伟大的迪克・埃克伦德在场边指导
How could I stand a chance without the great

1154
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:52,930
我怎么可能赢呢  对吧
Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1155
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,550
当初就算我被穆金打死了  你也无动于衷吧    
You didn't give a fuck if I got killed by Mungin,

1156
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,570
如今你倒善心大发了
now, all of the sudden,

1157
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,850
担心桑切斯会伤着我
you're worried Sanchez is going to hurt me?

1158
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,950
为什么
Why?

1159
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,230
坦白点吧  迪克  就因为你现在
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck

1160
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,140
身陷大狱而不再是瞩目的焦点
in here and can't be the center of attention no more?

1161
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,390
-你就那么想出名吗  -这可是墨西哥式拳击
- You need it that bad? - It's a Mexican fight.

1162
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,250
那老墨发起狠来就像头野驴  你知道吗
He fights you, hits like a fucking mule, all right?

1163
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,470
15次连胜  你是真傻假傻? 
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

1164
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:12,300
那个开出租的白痴拉纳诺  他巴不得你死
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano? He went right for it.

1165
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,040
他就是个纸老虎  利用你偷钱
He's a paper gangster. He's using you to steal money.

1166
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,790
你为什么就不能闭上嘴为我高兴会
Why can't you just shut up and be happy for me?

1167
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,900
过去十年  我一直荒废在你和爱丽丝
I've spent the last ten years

1168
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,570
给我安排的坑爹的比赛中
of my life in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1169
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,820
如今我终于熬出点成绩
I've finally got a good thing going for me,

1170
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,050
你就不为我感到一丁点的欣慰吗  为什么
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

1171
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,490
你有什么战术  你想怎么对付桑切斯
What's your plan? How are you going to fight Sanchez?

1172
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,440
我不想谈这个
I ain't going to talk about that.

1173
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,080
你的战术是什么
What's your plan?

1174
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:37,240
-我不是来谈这个  -放屁  你就是
- I'm not here to talk about that. - Bullshit. Yes you are.

1175
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,390
你到时候看比赛就知道了
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

1176
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,150
我看不了  他们不让看
I can't watch it. They don't let us.

1177
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,840
说那太你妈暴力  明白吗
It's too fucking violent, you know?

1178
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,080
还有两分钟  迪奇
Two minutes, Dicky.

1179
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,780
-他们给我们放什么傻逼吸毒纪录片  -迪奇
- They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,  - Dicky.

1180
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,810
却不让我看亲弟弟的拳击赛
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

1181
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,070
说呀  小米  你想怎么打
Hey, Mick. What is it?

1182
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,710
你害怕了  你想不出战术所以无地自容?
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't even have a plan?

1183
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,320
我是你哥哥  告诉我
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1184
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,200
不论我说什么你都会嘲笑我
You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.

1185
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,830
怎么会呢  跟我说说
I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

1186
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,500
步步紧逼  中间回合开始右下击拳
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.

1187
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,200
那是他软肋
He's weak against overhand right.

1188
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,910
-谁出的这主意  胖子奥基夫吗  -操你妈  迪奇
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe? - Fuck you, Dicky.

1189
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,780
他出击  你就躲  拖着他  直到他丧失斗志
You've got to run against this guy. Let him burn himself out.

1190
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,260
贴紧他  懂吗  到他内侧去  注意脚下移动
Take it to the body, right? Get inside, switch stances

1191
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,060
用假动作恍他  声东击西
like you're going to work his right. Hit him on the left.

1192
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,410
你不是我  你也不可能成为我
You ain't me. Okay, you can't be me.

1193
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,470
就因为你以前都是按你的意愿行事
You had a hard enough time being you when you had your fucking chance,

1194
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,420
所以你才沦落到大狱里  好吧
and that's why you're in here, all right?

1195
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,990
我要用我自己的方式击败桑切斯
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1196
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:36,600
我就是在说你的方式  你个傻瓜
I'm talking about the way you fight, you moron!

1197
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:40,710
-你知道我是对的  他知道  -是呀
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right. - All right.

1198
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,190
桑切斯对阵沃德
拉斯维加斯  托马斯&麦克体育中心

1199
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,990
打右路
Blow to the right.

1200
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:53,630
沃德入场  目前战绩  29胜  7负
Ward just in. 29 wins, 7 losses so far.

1201
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,520
20次击倒对手  
Twenty KOs.

1202
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,460
刚J・B也指出  他自从回归拳坛后
He's been a little better since he refocused himself on the sport,

1203
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,020
表现一直不错
as J.B. pointed out.

1204
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,190
现在登场的是沃德的对手  来自墨西哥蒂华纳的
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

1205
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:13,360
阿尔方索・桑切斯  战绩  16胜  15次击倒对手
out of Tijuana, Mexico. See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

1206
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,210
其中8次在第一局内击倒
8 first-round KOs.

1207
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,550
这位是迈克・托马  此次比赛的发起人
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,

1208
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:19,310
他在桑切斯身上投入不小
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1209
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,960
称桑切斯是拳击界最有潜力的新星之一
He says that Sanchez is one of the most talented young prospects in the sport of boxing.

1210
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:40,040
这可算是拳击史上最糟糕的比赛之一了
This is really one of the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1211
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,240
米奇・沃德已经31岁了  他出来比赛就为了养家糊口
Micky Ward is 31 years old. He's here because he needs the money.

1212
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,900
他正在挨打  
He's taking a beating.

1213
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,830
他真没必要在这挨拳头
My point is that he doesn't really have to sit here and take this beating.

1214
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,300
-他该做些什么  -比如说?  让教练扔毛巾?
- He can do something about it. - Which is what?  Have his corner throw in the towel?

1215
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,980
或是回击
Or fight back.

1216
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,270
你可以看到他的力量  沃德被他打得步步后退
You can see his power. Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

1217
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,640
除非裁判认为他撑不住了...
Unless the referee thinks he can't...

1218
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,460
裁判该停止比赛
The referee should just stop this fight.

1219
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,600
米奇肯定不想再继续下去了
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

1220
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,410
不  他打得畏首畏尾  迪克
 No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

1221
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,620
一直躲闪  不回击
Running away, not hitting back.

1222
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,130
天哪  这下肯定伤得不轻
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

1223
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,810
接着这么找死吧
Doing the same old shit.

1224
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,880
从没看过这么惨的比赛
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

1225
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,960
是我告诉他那么做的  妈妈  他在按我说的做
He's doing what I told him, Mom. He's doing what I told him.

1226
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,820
别担心  是我教他那样的
Don't worry about it. He's doing what I told him.

1227
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,700
米奇・沃德只得...
Micky Ward showing nothing but...

1228
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,630
你总躲什么  别再抱头乱窜了
What are you running around for? Stop running around.

1229
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,860
闭你娘的嘴  萨尔  别说了
Shut the fuck up, Sal. Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,210
我不知道你在干什么  米奇
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.

1231
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,720
想谈谈吗
You want to fucking tell me?

1232
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:40,060
我真不知道你想干什么
Because I don't know what you're doing.

1233
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,110
我们已经输了五局了
We'd have lost all five rounds.

1234
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,070
这就是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

1235
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,160
这太可怕了  太可怕了
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1236
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,360
一会告诉我是否还要继续  小米
You've got to show me something soon, Mick

1237
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,540
否则我要终止比赛了
or I'm going to stop the fight.

1238
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,050
他们要终止比赛了  米奇
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

1239
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,960
他是要贴进去  妈妈
He's got to go inside, Mom.

1240
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,990
他要贴到对方身上  他懂的  
He's got to take it to the body. He's got it.

1241
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:56,950
不许终止比赛  用不着终止
Don't stop the fight. Don't stop it.

1242
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,540
你得做点什么  宝贝  做点什么
You've got to do something, baby. You've got to do something.

1243
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,140
试着按我说的做  米奇
Try what we talked about, Micky.

1244
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,070
记得咱的战术吗  可你偏不照做
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

1245
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,400
去吧 
Let's go.

1246
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,250
米奇  你已经输了前五回合
All right, Micky. You've lost the first five rounds,

1247
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,610
下一回合还会如此悲剧吗
what's the next strategy going to be?

1248
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,000
桑切斯两记右直拳  三记左勾拳
Double right hand by Sanchez, then a triple left hook.

1249
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,210
拳头如雨点般打在米奇・沃德脸上
Couple of the left hooks landed flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1250
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,410
沃德紧紧贴住桑切斯
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1251
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,520
米奇・沃德的表现十分奇怪
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

1252
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,700
沃德貌似想要用一记重拳
Ward seems to be trying to land

1253
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,980
警告桑切斯自己不是好惹的...
one big shot to either change Sanchez's mind...

1254
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,610
他双臂的防御开始松懈
And he's beginning to open up,

1255
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:32,510
他想趁机靠近沃德
taking advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

1256
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,820
挥拳猛击这个
and throw against a fighter

1257
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,290
并不出拳进行自卫的拳击手
who is not defending himself by punching.

1258
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:41,130
桑切斯想要终结这场比赛
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

1259
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:48,940
你干什么呢  加油
What are you doing? Come on.

1260
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,710
加油
Come on!

1261
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,160
他被一记上钩拳击倒了
He's down on an uppercut.

1262
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,880
一记精准的左勾拳直击要害
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

1263
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,080
很精彩  沃德刚挥出一记很不错的右拳
Very good. And right after Ward threw a pretty good right hand.

1264
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,350
小米  你还好吗
Mick, you all right?

1265
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,380
这场比赛不该再进行下去了
This is a fight that should be stopped.

1266
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:14,380
加油  头部  身体  头部连击
Come on, head, body, head.

1267
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,310
-这根本不是专业竞技  -我就是这意思
- This is not professional. - That's exactly what I'm saying.

1268
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,430
给钱我也不愿意看这样的比赛
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

1269
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,300
加油  小米  头部  身体  头部连击
Come on, Mick! Head, body, head.

1270
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,400
沃德作出了一记漂亮的身体攻击
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1271
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:34,030
-或许他要展开反击  -我说的是他的身体攻击
- Maybe he'll turn it around. - I'm talking about his body shot.

1272
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,960
桑切斯被那拳击倒了  噢  天啊
Sanchez dropped by that shot! Oh, my God!

1273
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,580
这拳太漂亮了
What a punch!

1274
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,340
这是你所见过的最不可思议的击倒
The most unlikely knockout you have ever seen!

1275
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,200
那是一记肾击
That is a kidney shot.

1276
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,890
这种肾击并没有那么猛烈
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

1277
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,040
我还是没法相信刚才看到的那一幕
I still don't believe what I just saw!

1278
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,120
米奇  米奇  米奇
Micky! Micky! Micky!

1279
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,710
米奇赢了
Micky won!

1280
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,320
现在看来  米奇・沃德似乎用他那
Now did Micky Ward just make

1281
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,630
卓越不群的拳击战术把我们都给耍了
idiots of us all with a spectacular piece of strategy?

1282
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,110
-再看一遍  -太惊人了
- Take another look. - Amazing.

1283
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,610
这真是来自洛厄尔的米奇・沃德
A big win in the career of

1284
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,410
拳击生涯中一次至关重要的胜利
Micky Ward of Lowell, Mass.

1285
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,970
米奇・沃德的双拳创造了一次令人难以置信的胜利
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

1286
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,400
他在比赛中
who had all but given

1287
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,420
居然直接放弃了前六轮
away the first half dozen rounds in the bout.

1288
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,840
我想米奇的这种打法是因为
I think what Micky did was he

1289
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,420
他认准了他的身体攻击会收到奇效
recognized that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

1290
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,650
米奇这名选手的打法
Micky's a better fighter than

1291
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,590
比仅仅一味硬拼要强的多
that to not be running from that guy like that.

1292
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,800
大逆转
Theater of the unexpected.

1293
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,550
你永远不知道会发生什么  对吧
Hey, you never know what can happen, right?

1294
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,680
在拳击场上决不能放弃  对吧  决不能放弃
Never give up in this game, right? Never give up.

1295
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,360
千真万确  朋友们
You can't make it up, folks.

1296
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,890
你们知道米奇刚才说了什么吗
You know what Micky just said?

1297
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,850
他说在拳击场上  你决不能放弃
He said you can't give up in this game.

1298
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:41,210
可能米奇当时听到我说他该停止这场比赛
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say he should stop this fight,

1299
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,440
-于是他站出来阻止了  -没错
- and he went out and stopped it. - Yeah.

1300
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,100
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1301
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,240
我在下面看着 
I'm looking over and I'm

1302
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,250
我跟他们一样  心里想着
thinking to myself like they were thinking:

1303
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,490
这比赛完了
This thing is over.

1304
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:52,600
可我告诉你  甚至是那些解说
But I tell you what. Even look at the commentators.

1305
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,880
在击倒倒数结束之前
They started to take their

1306
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,020
他们都把耳机摘下来了
headsets off before he was even counted out.

1307
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,360
-他们都想走了  -小米
- They just wanted to get out of there. - Mick. Mick...

1308
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,620
我刚又跟迈克・托马谈了谈
I just spoke to Mike Toma again

1309
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,520
他跟我说了些很有意思的事
and he just told me something very interesting.

1310
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:04,180
他刚告诉我  要是桑切斯今晚赢了
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,

1311
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,500
他就能参加拳王争霸赛
he would have gotten the title shot.

1312
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,620
-老天啊  那太棒了  -怎么了  这有什么棒
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful. - Why? Why is that beautiful?

1313
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,410
-拳王争霸赛  -这下米奇能参加了
- A title shot. - Micky gets the shot.

1314
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,450
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

1315
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,060
你得把这事弄清楚了
You've got to be very clear about this,

1316
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,330
-这可关系到我儿子的将来  -我刚跟那人谈过
- because this is my kid's future. - I just spoke to the guy.

1317
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,800
-迈克  来  告诉他们  -恭喜
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys. - Hey. Congratulations.

1318
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,710
-谢谢  -再也不是垫脚石了
- Thank you. - Not a stepping stone anymore.

1319
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,330
我就知道你有这种天分  多么伟大的战术
I always knew you had the talent. That was a hell of a strategy,

1320
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,900
不断消耗他的体能  然后一记身体攻击终结
wearing him down like that and taking it to the body.

1321
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,090
我在这行干了三十年
Thirty years in the business,

1322
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,580
还从没见过这样的击倒
I've never seen a knockout like that.

1323
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,830
评论员莫什特都在准备给你写讣告了
Larry Merchant was writing your

1324
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,060
然而桑切斯像吃了枪子一样倒了下来
obituary and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

1325
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,580
你从哪儿学的这招
Where did you get that?

1326
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,270
那是我哥哥教我的第一课
That's the first thing my brother taught me.

1327
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,790
敲打他们的头  再猛捣他们的身体
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

1328
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,810
-真是一记漂亮的身体攻击  -谢谢
- That's a hell of a body shot. - Thank you.

1329
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,200
准备好参加拳王争霸赛了吗
You ready for a title shot?

1330
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,010
-准备好了  -准备好了
- Yes! - Yes!

1331
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,720
我刚说的就是这个
That's what I was talking about.

1332
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,660
他准备好了  你准备好了  对吧
He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

1333
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:54,300
伦敦的拳王谢伊・奈里
Shea Neary in London for the title!

1334
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,630
你说真的吗  我们得庆祝一下
Are you kidding me? We've got some celebrating to do.

1335
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,580
-没错  我也这么想  -太感谢你了
- Yeah, I think so. - Thank you so much.

1336
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,090
你将会成为伟大的拳王  孩子
You're going to have a great champion, my boy.

1337
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,480
那是你哥哥的梦想
It's what your brother would have always wanted.

1338
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,110
他甚至没法到场
He's not even going to be there.

1339
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:36,480
-嘿  -爸爸
- Hey! - Daddy!

1340
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,700
-嘿  小伙子  -爸爸  爸爸
- Hey there, buddy. - Daddy, Daddy!

1341
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:43,110
见到你真好  
Good to see you! Oh!

1342
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,320
抱得好  抱得好
That's a good hug! That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

1343
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,650
-宝贝  -妈妈
- Sweetheart! - Hi, Mom.

1344
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:52,230
你看起来真好
Oh, you look so good.

1345
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,800
天啊
Oh, my God.

1346
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:05,520
-你的牙真干净  -是吧  看我这口牙
- You have clean teeth. - I do! Look at my teeth!

1347
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,750
我换了新牙  都是新的
I got new teeth. Everything.

1348
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,240
你觉得我看起来怎么样
How do you think I look?

1349
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,610
-很好  -是吗
- Good. - Yeah?

1350
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,430
-你要带上我吗  -不
- Are you going to carry me? - No.

1351
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,330
还有蛋糕  冰淇淋
And more cake. Ice cream...

1352
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,420
-冰淇淋加蛋糕  -冰淇淋加蛋糕蛋糕蛋糕
- Ice cream with cake. - Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

1353
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,110
冰淇淋蛋糕蛋糕  冰淇淋蛋糕蛋糕
Ice cream, cake and cake. Ice cream, cake and cake.

1354
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,250
呱呱
Quacker!

1355
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,970
妈
Mom.

1356
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,010
-他们给你换了新牙  -是啊
- They gave you some new teeth, huh? - Yeah.

1357
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,240
乔治  你怎么出来了
Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?

1358
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,880
把他放出来了吗  妈
Run him out of the house, Mom?

1359
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,060
听着  来认识一下萨尔・拉纳诺
Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

1360
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,440
你好吗  迪奇
How you doing, Dicky?

1361
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,570
咱们训练吧  好吗
Let's spar, huh?

1362
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:32,600
你好  夏琳
Hi, Charlene.

1363
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,970
-欢迎回来  -嘘  得给他个惊喜
- Welcome back! - Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

1364
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,940
我要迟到了
I'm running late.

1365
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,640
小米  我简直难以形容
Mick, I can't even tell you.

1366
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,850
重新回到这间难闻的更衣室
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

1367
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,620
经历了这一切  终于能回来跟你一起
Getting back with you is what got me through.

1368
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:14,450
你看起来不错  眼睛更清澈了
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

1369
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,890
爱丽丝说入狱对我来说或许是件好事
Alice says prison might have been the best thing for me.

1370
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:24,230
让我更纯净了  把我这里洗干净了
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

1371
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,480
那真好  迪克
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1372
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:31,050
我得跟你说件事
I've got to talk to you about something.

1373
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,510
还是那个老柜子
The old locker, huh?

1374
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:43,290
我跟他们保证不再跟你一起干了
I made a promise to them I wouldn't work with you again.

1375
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:57,130
我只能这样  发生了那么多事  对不起
I had to, after everything that happened. I'm sorry.

1376
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,280
你说真的吗
You sticking to that?

1377
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,190
我很高兴你回来了
I'm glad you're back.

1378
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,010
你看起来很好
You look good.

1379
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,220
我不知道还能说些什么
I don't know what else to say.

1380
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:24,000
-小米  你他妈开玩笑吧  -没有
- Mick, you fucking kidding me? - No, I'm not.

1381
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,330
-米奇  -米奇  过来
- Hey, Micky. - Micky, come on in.

1382
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:34,610
你们太吵了  还是省着回家庆祝吧  拜托
You're too loud. You've got to do this at home, please.

1383
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,480
-你说什么呢  -妈  拜托
- What are you talking about? - Mom, please.

1384
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,280
好吧  姑娘们  咱们收起来
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1385
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,830
-为什么  -把它收起来
- Why? - Let's get it put away.

1386
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,660
要是米奇想这样  我们就收起来
If that's what Micky wants, we're going to put it away.

1387
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,480
-哥哥来了  -迪奇
- There's your brother. - Dicky!

1388
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,950
大家好  大家好
Hey there. Hey there.

1389
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:26,090
真好  真不错
It's nice. It's nice.

1390
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:29,280
-我们花了两个星期  -雪莉  别哭了
- Been working on it for two weeks. - Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

1391
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,300
好吧  姑娘们  来吧  咱们回家
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.

1392
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,260
显然  现在不适合弄这个
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

1393
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,170
-怎么了  -我们不能一起干了
- What's going on? - We ain't going to work together.

1394
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,150
他们不想让我和他一起
They don't want me to work with him.

1395
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:46,150
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1396
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,480
这可不对
That's not right.

1397
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,810
要不是迪奇  米奇可赢不了桑切斯
Micky never would have won Sanchez without Dicky.

1398
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:55,520
你他妈瞎说什么  给我收回去
That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!

1399
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:59,220
-别他妈这么跟我妈说话  -操你妈的
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that. - Fuck you!

1400
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,690
你怎么不问问米奇
Why don't you ask Micky?

1401
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,630
我们要训练了  让他们走
We're going to train. They've got to go.

1402
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,620
让他们走  小米  拜托了
They've got to go, Mick. Come on.

1403
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,510
-你还好吗  -问他  乔治
- You all right? - Ask him, George.

1404
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,470
问问他要不是他哥哥  他能赢桑切斯吗
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez without his brother.

1405
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:19,950
对  要不是迪奇我赢不了桑切斯
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez if it wasn't for Dicky.

1406
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,710
-你怎么能当着奥基夫这么说  -因为事实如此
- How can you say that to O'Keefe? - Because it's true.

1407
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,850
我试着用我们的战术
I went in with our game plan and it

1408
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:28,300
可没奏效  我就重新用迪奇教我的打法
wasn't working so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

1409
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,020
要不是你我也赢不了  奥基夫  行吗
And I wouldn't have won without you, either, O'Keefe, okay?

1410
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,130
你也知道  我们刻苦训练  你让我准备充分
I mean, you know that. We worked hard. You got me ready.

1411
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,830
你的信心和斗志都来自奥基夫
You got your confidence and your focus from O'Keefe,

1412
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,700
来自萨尔  父亲  还有我
and from Sal, and from your father, and from me.

1413
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,910
-迪奇是个废物  -喂
- Dicky is a junk bag. - Hey!

1414
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,260
他就是个废物
He's a junk bag!

1415
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:47,850
-操你妈的  夏琳  -操你妈的
- Fuck you, Charlene. - Oh, fuck you!

1416
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,940
我已经清醒了
I'm sober.

1417
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,050
是吗  我觉得你既然已经出来了
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going

1418
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,690
肯定又会找借口去弄那玩意
to need something for something now that you're out.

1419
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,460
-"我的背不行了"  -操你妈的
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!" - Fuck you!

1420
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,770
-为什么你总是找我的茬  -操你妈的
- What are you always picking on me for, huh? - No, fuck you!

1421
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,150
那奥基夫怎么说  我们是一条船上的
And what about O'Keefe? We're in the same boat.

1422
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,920
我们一起工作过吧  奥基夫  你跟我
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe? You and me.

1423
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,250
现在他在这怎么就行了  
It's all right for him to be here?

1424
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,680
为什么问题都他妈出在我身上
Why am I the fucking problem?

1425
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,840
-我是他的亲人  他的家人  -你自己就是个问题
- I'm his blood! I'm his family! - You're the problem!

1426
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,420
我才是拳击手  好吗  不是你  不是你  也不是你
I'm the one fighting, okay? Not you, not you, and not you.

1427
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,710
-我知道我需要什么  -你需要迪奇吗
- I know what I need. - And you need Dicky?

1428
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,150
我想让迪奇回来
I want Dicky back.

1429
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,920
我也要你  夏琳  我也要奥基夫
And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe.

1430
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:20,180
我要我的家人  这有什么问题
I want my family. What's wrong with that?

1431
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,290
-这可不是我们说好的  宝贝  -她说得对  米奇
- Not the deal we made, baby. - She's right, Micky.

1432
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:28,000
-这不是我们说好的  -不是我们说好的
- That's not the deal. - It wasn't the deal.

1433
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,900
拜托  你不能这么对我们
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1434
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,180
你现在说话跟他们一样了
You sound like them now.

1435
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,980
-我说话跟他们一样  -对  你说话跟他们一样
- I sound like them now? - Yeah, you sound like them.

1436
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,330
我们说话跟他们一样
We sound like them?

1437
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:36,540
你不能这么对我们  你不能这么对我们
You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

1438
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,900
你说话跟他们一样
You sound like them.

1439
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:41,080
你他妈真该好好听听你在说什么
You should fucking listen to yourself.

1440
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:42,510
你说话跟他们一样  一模一样
You sound like them, just like them.

1441
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,740
或许这才是你的归宿
Maybe this is where you belong.

1442
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,130
-你就是这么爱他的吗  -夏琳
- That's the way you love him? - Charlene!

1443
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,540
-拜托  -你想要你哥哥  自求多福吧
- Come on! - You want your brother? Good luck.

1444
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,250
-奥基夫  拜托  -米奇
- O'Keefe, come on... - Micky.

1445
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,300
米奇
Micky...

1446
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,810
好了  事出必有因
Come on, everything happens for a reason.

1447
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,660
说不定这样对大家都好
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1448
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,770
老天自有公道
God has a plan.

1449
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,430
想跟你哥哥练练吗
Want to spar with your brother?

1450
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,820
迪克・埃克伦德  洛厄尔的骄傲
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

1451
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,150
那些年都是这么练的吧
Watching that for years, huh?

1452
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,040
你他妈这是干什么
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

1453
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,560
-米奇  我的天哪  -爸爸  爸爸
- Micky, for crying out loud! - Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1454
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,090
把那孩子带出去
Take that baby out of here.

1455
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,410
十分钟前我就跟你说了把他带走
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

1456
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,200
宝贝  你还好吗  你的背怎么样了
Sweetheart, are you all right? You okay? Your back?

1457
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,630
你干什么呢  你出什么毛病了
What are you doing? What's the matter with you?

1458
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,750
这次能为了我吗  爱丽丝
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

1459
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,880
就一次  就这么一次  不为了迪奇
Just once? Maybe just this one time, not for Dicky?

1460
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,400
我知道你觉得现在他回来了
I know you think he's coming back,

1461
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,700
可他都四十了
but he's forty years old and he

1462
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,010
他嘴里连他妈一颗自己的牙都没有
doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

1463
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:59,400
先让你弟弟说两句  行吗
Let your brother talk for a minute here, all right?

1464
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,190
你想说什么  宝贝
What are you saying, sweetheart?

1465
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:04,000
再不闭嘴我打爆你的头  迪奇
Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

1466
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:07,050
你想怎么着
What are you going to do?

1467
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,970
你他妈想让我打爆你的头吗
You want me to bust your fucking head open?

1468
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,120
拜托  拜托  乔治
Come on! Come on! George!

1469
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,050
-求求你们  -迪奇
- Please! Please! - Dicky!

1470
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:14,620
你想说什么  宝贝  告诉我
What are you saying, sweetheart? Tell me what you're saying.

1471
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,550
这该是我的比赛
This is supposed to be my fight.

1472
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,020
-这是我成为拳王的机会  -是你的比赛
- This is my shot at a title. - It is your fight.

1473
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,300
我再也不会有这样的机会了
I won't get another one after this.

1474
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,830
我自私吗  我有没有一直在叫自己的名字
Am I being selfish? Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

1475
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,820
要是我自私  对不起
Because you know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1476
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,010
我一直以为我能为了冠军而奋斗
I thought I was fighting for the championship.

1477
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,810
我还以为你也是我妈妈
And I thought you were my mother, too.

1478
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,780
我是你妈妈
I am your mother.

1479
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:39,970
小米  对不起  我不知道你会这么想  好吗
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt like that, all right?

1480
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:43,090
要是我做错了什么  我会改的
If I made mistakes, I'm going to be better.

1481
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,920
我不想伤害你  真对不起
I don't want to hurt you. I am so sorry.

1482
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,880
对不起
I'm sorry.

1483
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,260
迪奇  你陪着他
Dicky! Stay with him.

1484
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,710
迪奇
Dicky!

1485
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,610
迪奇
Dicky!

1486
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,660
-迪奇  -我有事要做
- Dicky! - Got to do something.

1487
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,570
迪奇  等会  拜托
Dicky, wait. Come on.

1488
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,880
米奇需要你  我也需要你
Micky wants you. I want you.

1489
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,730
我有事要做
I've got to do something.

1490
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,890
我知道你是什么意思  别这样
I know what that means. Don't do this!

1491
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,890
"洛厄尔的骄傲"回来了

1492
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,020

1496
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:04,930
-看看你  -看看这小子
- Look at you! - Look at my boy, huh?

1497
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,080

1503

要不要上去坐坐
So, want to head up there?

1504
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,250
迪奇回来了

1505
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:30,480

-给你庆祝一下  宝贝  -回来吧
- Throw a little party for you, babe. - Hey, come back!

1507
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,670
他这是搞什么鬼
What the hell was that?

1508
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,220
夏琳  我是迪奇
Charlene, it's Dicky.

1509
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:07,720
滚远点  人渣
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

1510
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,560
你他妈的还有脸来我家
How fucking dare you come?

1511
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,080
滚你妈的
Cock sucker!

1512
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,270
王八蛋

1513
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,260
垃圾
Fucking ass!

1514
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,080
烂货
Fucking sick!

1515
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,410
迪奇你个傻逼  给我滚远点
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky. I want you off my fucking porch.

1516
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,800
你他妈怎么不下来
Huh? Why don't you just

1517
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,340
让我们谈一谈
fucking come down here and talk to me, huh?

1518
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,280
你这混蛋居然敢来我家
You're such an asshole, coming to my fucking house.

1519
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,480
-还敢站在我家门口瞎喊  -对不起
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch! - Sorry, sorry.

1520
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,840
像你这么对着大街喊叫
It's not fucking ladylike to

1521
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,080
不太好吧
be shouting in the street like this, all right?

1522
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:36,790
-你这混蛋还敢来  -求你了
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here. - Please!

1523
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,760
-你以为我在乎吗  -求你了  下来吧
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care? - Come on. Just fucking...

1524
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,060
滚远点  迪奇
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

1525
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,110
那是什么狗  西班牙长耳猎犬吗
What kind of dog is that? Is that a cocker spaniel?

1526
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,060
我知道你受不了我
All right, I know you can't fucking stand me.

1527
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:06,800
是吗  你也知道啊
Really, what makes you say that?

1528
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,420
我告诉你件事
I got news for you, all right?

1529
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,170
我弟弟爱着你
My brother loves you,

1530
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:12,600
你不能因为我  就这么走了
and you can't just run away because of me.

1531
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,930
你不能这么对他
He don't deserve that, all right?

1532
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,530
如果你想我走  那我就走
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1533
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,930
-扯什么淡  -我说真的
- You're full of shit. - I swear to God.

1534
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,150
如果你肯回来  我就退出
I will quit if it means you'll come back, all right?

1535
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:23,960
但拜托你好好想想
But I want you to think about something.

1536
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:27,060
米奇有机会做成我从未做过的事
Micky has a chance to do something that I never did,

1537
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,310
我这辈子从没做过的事
that in my time, I never had.

1538
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,550
可不是  我当时可打败了苏格・雷
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance

1539
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:32,500
我他妈的真了不起
was with Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

1540
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,080
我可是洛厄尔的骄傲
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.

1541
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,820
没错  我打败了苏格・雷
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

1542
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,500
-我都知道  -我来是想和你改变这一切
- I've heard it. - I came to make things right with you.

1543
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:40,470
好  那就开始吧  首先
Okay, let's make things right. Number one:

1544
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,750
你没有击倒苏格・雷  是他自己绊倒的
You didn't knock down Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1545
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,820
我当时就在拳台上
I was in the ring. Don't you

1546
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,780
难道我不知道是怎么回事吗
think I know what really fucking happened that day?

1547
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,290
-你的生活成功吗  -我喜欢我的生活
- What have you ever done with your life? - I like my life.

1548
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,390
你都有过什么成就
Yeah? What have you ever done with it?

1549
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,140
我喜欢我现在的生活  迪奇
I like my life now, Dicky.

1550
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:56,300
你有没有过什么成就
What have you ever done with your life?

1551
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,930
你大学辍学  夏琳
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1552
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,100
只是个酒吧女  你的生活烂透了
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

1553
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:03,210
好吧
All right.

1554
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,550
我酗酒  还在很多酒吧工作过
I drink too much. I worked in a lot of bars.

1555
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,260
我毁掉了无数机会
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,

1556
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,820
但我正在努力改变
but I'm trying to do better here.

1557
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,850
-米奇也是  -我也是
- So is Micky. - So am I.

1558
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,250
你知道他需要我  我知道他也需要你
And he needs me, you heard him. And I know he needs you.

1559
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,810
你胳膊上那什么玩意
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1560
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,530
蛋糕的糖霜
It's icing.

1561
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:32,680
好吧
Okay.

1562
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,350
到时在米奇的教练席上再见  不然就见鬼去吧
I'll see you in Micky's corner. Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1563
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,480
-一言为定  -一言为定
- It's a deal. - All right, it's a deal.

1564
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,090
我们帮你都说好了  问她吧
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1565
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:56,960
好吧  现在去把奥基夫找回来
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1566
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,770
我会的
I will.

1567
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,700
小米
Hey, Mick.

1568
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,180
你觉得我击倒了苏格・雷吗
Do you think I knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard?

1569
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,570
你坚持了十回合  能打伤他已经很棒了
You went ten rounds. One of the best to do anything to hurt him.

1570
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,770
你是我的偶像
You're my hero.

1571
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,410
我曾经是
I was.

1572
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:23,730
曾经是
I was...

1573
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,350
-对不起  -真的吗
- I'm sorry. - Yeah?

1574
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:22,480
沃德对阵奈里

1576
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,830

米奇・沃德  我们有问题要问
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward! We have a question over here.

1580
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:19,630
你是如何训练的
How have you been training?

1581
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,920
没什么特别  刻苦训练而已
I train. I train hard.

1582
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,130
谢伊二十二战全胜  从未被击倒过

1584
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,250
我们其实期待着更强大的对手

1587
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,200
谢伊  你最喜欢哪个拳击手
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

1588
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,950
下一场你打算和谁较量
And who would you like to fight next?

1589
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:39,590
明天我会踩着米奇・沃德继续前进
I plan on moving right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

1590
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:42,330
与其他更伟大的选手比赛  比如加蒂
moving on to other big fighters, like Gatti.

1591
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,690
加蒂和我会进行一场伟大的比赛
I believe Gatti and I would make a great match.

1592
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:02,060
女士们先生们  这里是世界拳击联盟

1593
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:08,470
十二回合次中量级冠军赛
for the WBU Welterweight Championship of the World!

1594
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,310
别理他们  小米
Don't listen to them, Mick.

1595
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,110
下面进场的是来自马萨诸塞州
And there is Micky Ward of Lowell,

1596
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,790
洛厄尔的米奇・沃德
Massachusetts entering the ring.

1597
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,760
这是他第一次在美国之外比赛
It's his first fight outside the United States.

1598
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:19,610
米奇・沃德  三十胜七负
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses....

1599
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:22,920

1600
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:27,500
沃德在等待他的对手  谢伊・奈里
And now Ward awaits his opponent, Shea Neary.

1601
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,300
奈里自称欧洲的阿图罗・加蒂
Neary regards himself as the European Arturo Gatti,

1602
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,590
这说明他是个注重进攻的选手
meaning that he is a head-on high-contact fighter

1603
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,300
他每回合出拳达七十次
who throws seventy punches per round.

1604
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,690
奈里来自利物浦
Neary is from Liverpool

1605
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:43,380
所以他今晚会有众多的拥簇
and should have a huge following here tonight.

1606
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,590
伴随着麦洪的《狂欢》
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red" By the Mahone.

1607
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,030
奈里是当下次中量级世界冠军
Neary is the current Welterweight Champion of the World.

1608
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,420
他是个非常厉害的年轻选手
He is a very tough young man.

1609
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:59,010
他无比专注  像斯巴达勇士一样生活
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

1610
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,390
据他的赞助人称
And according to his promoters,

1611
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,320
他只做这几件事  吃  喝  思考
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

1612
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:08,190
和梦想自己的拳击之路
fantasize and dream of fighting.

1613
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,820
谢伊・奈里的战绩是二十二战全胜
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights and won them all.

1614
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,380
十七次击倒对手
Seventeen KOs.

1615
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:27,560
铃声响了再开始  两位请握手
Start when you hear the bell. Shake hands.

1616
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,150
你们两个  握手
Both of you. Shake hands.

1617
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:34,450
两个人站在拳台中间
As close as we just saw them

1618
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:38,090
头顶头相互较劲
in the middle of the ring, forehead to forehead.

1619
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:43,760
这就是我们所一直
That's how close we expect them

1620
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,570
期待的比赛气氛
to be for as long as this fight goes on.

1621
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:48,620
沃德远渡重洋来到这  不会那么轻松
Ward is a long ways from home. Don't coast in a foreign country.

1622
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,530
对于沃德来说  最大的挑战就是
Well, the big challenge for Ward is

1623
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,580
摆脱旧习惯  迅速进入比赛
to get off to a faster start than is customary for him.

1624
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:57,130
米奇・沃德在大赛中一向很慢热
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter in big fights.

1625
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,620
谢伊・奈里则是个急性子
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

1626
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,290
问题有待于第一回合
And that's the question that

1627
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:04,060
才能揭晓  比赛要开始了
hovers over round one. Get ready for the fight.

1628
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,080
谢伊・奈里已经把他逼至场边
Already Shea Neary starts taking it to him on the ropes.

1629
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,620
奈里开始击打身体  这可是沃德的强项
And Neary going to the body, which is Ward's specialty.

1630
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:14,110
奈里击打沃德的身体
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1631
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:15,930
然后奈里来了个漂亮的上勾拳
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1632
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:18,260
奈里以一个漂亮的左刺拳领先
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1633
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,890
不断用刺拳破坏对手的防御
Keeps opponents off balance, jabbing here and there.

1634
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,900
奈里一记漂亮的左勾拳击中了沃德
That was a good left hook by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1635
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,800
奈里在这个距离进攻
Ward not able to deal with him

1636
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,760
使得沃德有些被动
very well when Neary stands at range like this.

1637
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:35,450
-加油  -就是这样  打他
- Come on! - That's it! Get him!

1638
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,910
这对米奇・沃德来说有些艰难
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

1639
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:42,050
奈里不断用右拳击打沃德的身体
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.

1640
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,260
近距离不断地击打
They trade shots at close range.

1641
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:47,130
沃德试图反击
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

1642
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:48,970
奈里重新开始进攻了
and now Neary starts to come

1643
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:52,160
这回合进入最后三十秒
on and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

1644
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:54,600
-这下可够受  -停
- How about that! - Break!

1645
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,570
真是无比凶猛的一分钟啊
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.

1646
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,670
瞧瞧这个  难以置信
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

1647
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,170
多精彩的一回合
What a great round one!

1648
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,270
沃德需要跟上比赛节奏
Ward is going to have to pick up the tempo

1649
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,170
重振旗鼓  进行反击
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1650
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,530
奈里无疑更棒
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

1651
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:19,750
在上一回合奈里挥出了四记重击
Four hard right hands Neary has belted in the last minute.

1652
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,760
他比沃德更快  更果断地进攻
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.

1653
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,740
对于自己的目标非常肯定
Surer of what he wants to do.

1654
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,920
他们站在场中相持着
They're standing and trading shots at the center of the ring.

1655
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:29,100
对于沃德现在的情况
Ward's going to have to step

1656
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,990
他需要更加努力
it up a little bit more than he is right now.

1657
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,370
米奇・沃德的教练组
Micky Ward's corner taking

1658
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:34,560
真得好好研究一下现在的情况
a really deep look at what's going on now,

1659
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,790
他的亲友团也希望他能更加努力
and his family at ringside well aware he's stepping up in class.

1660
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:41,590
沃德需要更有侵略性
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

1661
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,300
他不能被动地等着对手犯错
He can't just try to wait until everything is perfect.

1662
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:46,940
随着比赛的进行米奇・沃德会越来越悲观
Despondence over Micky Ward is increasing as the fight goes on

1663
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:51,070
因为他的计划正确  他也在执行它
because his plan was the right one and he's executing it.

1664
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:58,360
如此多的击打让奈里占据着主动
Punches like these make it seem that it's now Neary's fight.

1665
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:01,620
沃德还从没有和奈里
Ward hasn't been in this

1666
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:05,100
这种强壮的对手比赛过
kind of war with as strong a fighter as Neary.

1667
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:10,150
他们在尝试用一拳打击对方
They are trying to hurt each other with only punches.

1668
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,350
他们了解了对方的意图
They've tested each other's will,

1669
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:14,930
现在在试探对方的技巧
now they're testing each other's skill.

1670
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,380
沃德被奈里一记右交叉拳搞得手忙脚乱
And Ward fumbled there by a right cross from Neary.

1671
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:21,060
沃德受伤了  他的步伐乱了
Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.

1672
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:24,770
奈里打算终结掉米奇
Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

1673
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:27,870
奈里猛烈地进攻着
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1674
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:31,420
而沃德甚至没想从围绳上离开
And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

1675
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,410
我看他是不能吧  杰夫
I don't know if he can, Jeff.

1676
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,400
他在等着奈里把他打出去
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

1677
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,680
米奇・沃德倒地了  他可能要出局了
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

1678
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:44,050
站起来  加油
Come on, that's it!

1679
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:46,650
好样的
That's my boy!

1680
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,580
向前  向前  加油
Forward! Forward! Come on!

1681
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:55,860
-沃德的脚步完全乱了  -废物  滚回美国吧
- Ward is out on his feet! - Loser! Go back to America!

1682
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:58,000
这就是米奇・沃德的终结了吧
This could be it for Micky Ward.

1683
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,680
迪奇  让他坐下  凳子他妈在哪
Dicky, get him a fucking stool! Where's the stool?

1684
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:03,350
滚一边去  夏琳
Charlene, will you get the fuck out of here with your high heels?

1685
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:08,890
沃德的哥哥在帮他恢复步伐
His brother's got Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1686
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,010
这么做是对的
I think this could be

1687
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,380
这是沃德最后的胜机
Ward's last chance to turn this fight around.

1688
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,140
这里是米奇沃德对阵
It's Micky Ward against the

1689
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,220
出拳凶狠利落的谢伊・奈里
aggressiveness and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1690
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:21,550
如果不好好防御  真的会受伤
If you don't have your defense up you can really get hurt.

1691
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,280
米奇・沃德陷入了困境
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

1692
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:27,090
奈里看来不打算把金腰带交给他
I don't think he's going to give it to him, at this rate.

1693
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,130
现在是生死存亡的时刻
This is a survival move.

1694
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:32,880
你难道想像我一样  只能打败苏格・雷吗
Are you like me? Huh? Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1695
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,420
我从没得过冠军  你得超过我
I never had to win, did I? You've got to do more than that.

1696
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:41,570
你要赢得冠军  为你  为我  为了洛厄尔
You've got to win a title. For you, for me, for Lowell.

1697
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:44,070
这是你的机会  你得好好抓牢
This is your time, all right? You take it.

1698
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:46,990
我也曾有过  但我搞砸了  你绝不能失败
I had my time, and I blew it. You don't have to, all right?

1699
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,770
现在给我站起来  把你所有压抑的愤怒
Now fucking get out there. Bring that fucking anger.

1700
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:53,410
把这么多年来所有的愤怒与不顺
All the shit you've been through over the fucking years,

1701
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,580
全部发泄到拳台上
put it in the ring right now.

1702
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,060
这是你的比赛  你的舞台
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

1703
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,980
-好  -记住  头部  身体  头部连击
- Okay. - Fucking head, body, head, body.

1704
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:02,490
-你说一遍  -头部  身体  头部连击
- Say it back to me. - Head, body, head, body.

1705
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:06,400
你能做到  别他妈地贴在围绳上
You can do it. Stay off the fucking ropes.

1706
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:13,360
如果我是米奇・沃德的教练
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1707
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:14,770
我在想  如果他在这回合
I'm thinking if he doesn't

1708
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,930
再不进攻  
pick things up this round and get going,

1709
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:21,130
他可能就没有机会了
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1710
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:23,610
离开围绳  离开围绳  小米
Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes, Mick!

1711
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,920
又是这样  沃德贴着围绳任由奈里进攻
Once again, Ward against the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1712
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:30,320
你在干什么  加油  小米
What are you doing? Come on, Mick...

1713
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,440
有时候你要是想赢
Sometimes if you want to win,

1714
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,660
就得去尝试一些没做过的事
you've got to be something that you're not.

1715
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:38,330
离开他妈的围绳  这样不行
Off the fucking rope, man! That ain't it!

1716
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:41,380
奈里继续着进攻
Neary continues to pound away.

1717
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:47,710
别站着不动  这是你的比赛  米奇
Don't take no abuse! This is your time, Micky!

1718
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,710
这都是为了你
It's all for you!

1719
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,980
-奈里两击不中  -就是这样  就是这样
- Two big misses by Neary. - That's it! That's it!

1720
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:55,840
沃德好像找回了节奏
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1721
01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:00,080
沃德压迫着奈里  不断地进攻
Now he backs Neary up. Ward trades his way back.

1722
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:03,140
沃德在点头  好像在说  来吧
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

1723
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:05,710
来吧  干上一架
"Come on, let's fight!"

1724
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:09,110
越来越接近奈里的胸部
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1725
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,730
现在米奇・沃德掌控了比赛
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1726
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,370
一记左勾拳  又一记上勾拳
And a left hook to the body, and an uppercut lands,

1727
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:17,090
现在他正压迫着奈里
and now he backs Neary up.

1728
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:20,100
沃德朝着奈里的身体给了一拳
Ward hits Neary with a body shot.

1729
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,850
四记左勾拳
Four left hooks in the body.

1730
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,830
奈里倒地了  二十三场职业比赛的第一次
Neary on his butt, first time in 23 professional fights

1731
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:32,470
谢伊・奈里被击倒了
that Shea Neary has gone down.

1732
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:34,900
就是这样  就是这样  米奇
This is it! This is it, Micky!

1733
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,810
本回合还剩二十三秒
23 seconds remain in this

1734
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:40,130
米奇现在胜利在望
round as Micky now wipes off Neary's gloves.

1735
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:48,760
沃德击中一记左勾拳  米奇・沃德不断进攻
Ward lands a huge left hook as Micky Ward works away.

1736
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,590
连续的左勾拳  又一记上勾拳
Blows to the body with the left hook. There's the uppercut again!

1737
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,910
比赛结束
Gonna stop it right there.

1738
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:01,950
米奇・沃德在第八回合以技术性击倒获胜
"Irish" Micky Ward with a big eighth-round TKO!

1739
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,930
他又做到了  他又做到了
He's done it again. He's done it again.

1740
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:11,070
米奇・沃德又艰难地赢得了一场大胜
They grinding gutting Micky Ward pulls out another big victory.

1741
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:25,560
你是世界冠军
You're the champion of the world,

1742
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:28,060
小米  你他妈的是世界冠军
Mick! You're the fucking champion of the world!

1743
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,560
你他妈真的做到了
You fucking did it!

1744
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:46,340
我儿子是世界冠军
My boy's the champion of the world!

1745
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,400
我爱你
I love you!

1746
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,160
镇里的人总说你是个拳击手
This town always said you're a fucking boxer, right?

1747
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:24,550
你觉得这一文不值
You thought it's a piece of shit.

1748
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,880
-他又让洛厄尔出了名  -是我们
- He put Lowell back on the map, you know. - We did.

1749
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:29,920

谁是曾经的"洛厄尔的骄傲"  是我
Who used to be the Pride of Lowell? Right here.

1751
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,680
现在谁是"洛厄尔的骄傲"  是他
Who's the Pride of Lowell now? Right there.

1752
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:37,760
本来就该是这样
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1753
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:40,900
把这份骄傲传下去  没什么比这更好了
Hand it down to him. Nothing better than that.

1754
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:43,180
没什么比这更好了
Nothing better than that...

1755

他做到了  我得走了
He did it. I've got to go.

1756
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:46,940
我得走了
I've got to go.

1757
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,990
米奇・沃德又和阿图罗・加蒂进行了三场比赛
出场费达到几百万

1758
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:58,030
他在2003年退役

1759
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:03,470
米奇在2005年娶了夏琳  他们和女儿凯茜一起生活在洛厄尔

1760
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:08,760
迪奇依然是当地的传奇人物
他在弟弟的体育馆训练拳击手

1761
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:19,030
呱呱
Quacker!

1762
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:23,910
你的牙怎么没了
Boo, where's your teeth?
