1
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,130
Are you gonna... You bringing Micky in?

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,130


3
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,070
Yeah, he's here.

4
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,150
He should come. He should be here as well.

5
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,300
We thought that Micky is coming to answer the questions.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,520
No, they said it was going to be both of us.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,870
Am I looking right into the camera here?

8
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,410
Just look at me right now.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,910
All right.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,090
You're not going to look at the camera with the interviews?

11
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,940
I started boxing when I was twelve years old

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,560
and I lied and said I was eighteen or whatever it was.

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,490
I had a different name and everything.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,590
I mean, I don't have any fights,

15
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,750
I've done a hundred more than that

16
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,310
before I turned professional.

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,170
This morning you said that...

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,840
- Why are we doing this? - One more time.

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,820
You want to go over it all? You want to start again?

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,290
He's my younger brother. I taught him everything he knows.

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm still his trainer. I know we've got different styles,

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,450
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,670
You know, like, I'm not even there.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,370
That's what Sugar Ray said.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,300
I was the most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,370


27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,370
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,720
I told him he couldn't get to me.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,440
He couldn't get to me.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,380
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,180
Everybody still talks about it, you know, especially my brother.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,580
His whole life he wanted to do what I did, you know?

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,930
But we're very different fighters.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,700
Micky's a heavy hitter. He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,530
Thunderous left punch.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,570
Micky, he takes a punishment.

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,040
I don't know why he does it.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,240
I'd say "You all right?" He likes getting on the inside.

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,770
I stay on the outside.

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,380


41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,290
Come on!

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,030
Dicky...

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,900
Would you come on?

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Stop. You've got to help me finish this.

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,290
Come on!

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Unpredictable as ever!

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,480
You don't have to be Columbo to see where this fight is headed!

48
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, bam!

49
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,920
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

50
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,090
HBO's making a movie on me and my comeback

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,750
and my brother is going to beat Saoul Mamby in Atlanta next week!

52
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,610
The Pride of Lowell is back!

53
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,810
Quacker!

54
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,810


55
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,410
Who wants some? Who wants some?

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,700
I want a cut.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,870
Doing good?

58
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,940
You guys having a good day?

59
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,740
How are you?

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,490
Come on. Come on. What you got? What you got going on?

61
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,620
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

62
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,450
How are you guys, huh?

63
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm making my comeback.

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,800
Hey, Marty, Marty. Come out here, huh?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,910
HBO is making a movie on me!

66
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,620
Hey, beautiful.

67
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,730
You got that?

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,230
Can't remember who she is. I can't remember shit!

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,870
Hey! Hey, Garcia!

70
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
How are you, nice?

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,840
How'd you get here? Drive around?

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,940
Hey, Ray. Hey. I love you, Ray.

73
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,180
This is what it's all about.

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,830
He make mistake?

75
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,030
No, he'll be here. Like I said,

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,410
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,

77
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,660
but when he gets here we work hard.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,310
He's supposed to be training you right now, right?

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,140
Why don't you just go talk to them, my sisters?

81
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,460
They'll talk your ear off.

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,360
You gotta pay them to shut up.

83
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,860
He can tell you how Dicky was helping him.

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,540
Come on, Micky.

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,520
Okay.

86
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,660
You know where he is.

88
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,810
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

89
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,620
Where's Dicky? Girls?

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,410
- I don't know. - You see him this morning?

91
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,470
- Your brother? - Not this morning.

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,720
Look at Mom! All dressed up for the movie, huh?

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,390
You are smoking hot!

94
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,160
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,520
My Dicky should be doing that.

96
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,430
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

97
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,550
Micky's got an important fight coming up

98
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,570
and he's not training.

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,390
Forget about him. Never mind about him.

100
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

101
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,910
Start saying to Micky...

102
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,280
He's not part of this, all right?

103
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,510
Alice, he's not being handled right.

104
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,690
Did you get me coming in all right?

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,680
You want me to do it again?

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,020
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

107
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,390
- Dicky's the trainer. - I'm doing him favor, Alice.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
I will show you over here

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,850
these scrapbooks I have been collecting for years.

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
Micky used to follow his big brother everywhere.

111
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,760
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

112
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,150
In '78 we got the offer to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

113
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,150


114
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,700
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?

115
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,840
Well, you're from HBO,

116
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,100
you've got to see it again! Come on. Where's the video at?

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,380


118
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,500
Tonight my son is going to

119
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,030
surprise everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,070
Believe me. I know it.

121
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,200
Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.

122
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,380
That's a good possibility.

123
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,730
He comes in here against a good boxer,

124
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,730
a young man who can punch,

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,320
and I would like to say at this time

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,660
that physically they're just about equal.

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,650
Leonard is down. Let's see if that's a knockout.

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
This is unbelievable.

129
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,940
Eklund just walked over there.

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,960
Nobody seems to know what's happening.

131
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,430
Dicky did it.

132
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,070
Dicky did it.

133
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,290
Dicky did it!

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,550
Aren't you supposed to be training Micky right now?

135
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,090
No, it ain't until 9:00.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,540
- 11:45, Dick. - What?

138
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,770
Where'd you fucking park the car, Boo Boo?

139
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,930
I didn't park it. You did.

140
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,610
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.

141
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,650
You've got the keys, huh?

142
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,390
I didn't park it, man.

143
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,820
- Not here. I don't know... - Check your pockets, all right?

144
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,160
Oh, fuck it, I'll run. I need the fucking road work.

145
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,310
Road work? Are you crazy?

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,870
He's a great runner.

147
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,850
- Quacker! - Hey, Dicky.

148
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,840
Better late than never.

149
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,980
Here, look.

150
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,880
Detectives on the scene...

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,180
Get to the bar with this...

152
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,140
- Figure this one out, huh? - Why don't you...

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Hold it. Hold it. Let me get this straight.

154
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,330
You guys are working in

155
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,420
the same corner as Micky, together, right?

156
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,890
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner.

157
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,900
- This is what goes on. - Okay. It must be...

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,010
Don't you have a job to go to or something?

159
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,720
Really, O'Keefe has a job that he should be at.

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,340
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's working overtime here.

161
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,390
So we go at this old man:

162
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,830
Jewish, black, former world champion.

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,630
I think we've got all the bases covered.

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,020
And my kid brother, he's lost three fights in a row.

165
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,070
He can't get used to losing. It's a mental thing.

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,620
But we're gonna break that with Mamby, right?

167
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,220
Yeah, I hope. When we can train.

168
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,880
When we train. Right. Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

169
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,560
- Wasting time? - Half the fucking day's gone.

170
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,190
Yeah, half the day's gone. I've been waiting for you.

171
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,430
Come on, move. We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

172
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,230
Take it out on the head.

173
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,680
Head, body, head. That's your combo.

174
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,360
Head, body, head, body.

175
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,290
My Dicky taught him that.

176
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,730
You know, Sugar Ray's going to be there

177
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,040
calling the fight for ESPN.

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,940
I ain't seen him since I knocked him down,

179
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,000
like, fourteen years ago or something, right?

180
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,860
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

181
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,820
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

182
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,550
Don't want to embarrass yourself in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,820
Come on, head, body, head.

184
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,320
Your punch, man!

185
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,360
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,130
Use your whole fucking body now.

187
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,300
George's fingers are so fucking big he can't even dial the phone!

188
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,190
That's not helping, George!

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
- Wait, I'm confused. - What?

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,890
- I'm confused, too. - We're confused.

191
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,250
- George is whose father? - You're confused?

192
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,580
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's, Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

193
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,290
- Is Dick Eklund. - Yeah.

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,650
And even though Alice is an Eklund, so are Cindy and Cathy.

195
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,650
George is really...

196
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,830
- And Micky... - No.

197
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,680
Micky and I are Wards.

198
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,660
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund and I were separated, right?

199
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,000
And then there was George. Just George.

200
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,460
- George is my man. - George is our papa.

201
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,170
After Dick, it was just George.

202
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,170


203
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,380
Come on. Come over here...

204
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,050
Why don't you just go talk to her? She's a nice girl.

205
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,810
I told her all about you.

206
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,420
I don't want to ask her. She's going to say no.

207
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,850
Can't beat that ass, can you?

208
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,750
Get at it. Go. Come on.

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,600
Are you just going to stand there and stare at my ass?

210
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,630
Your father stares at my ass but he talks to me.

211
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,270
He thinks you're the greatest.

212
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,060
He didn't tell me you were new.

213
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,040
Keep the change, doll.

214
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,750
He told me you came for you sister.

215
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,540
- This is a tip? - Yeah, that's my tip!

216
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,470
You know what the bell says about this one?

217
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,180
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

218
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,960
Comes in every day, gives me shitty tips.

219
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,650
Yeah, fuck you, too.

220
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
You pave streets, right?

221
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

222
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,180
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

223
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm no stepping stone.

224
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,790
You're the guy they use

225
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,090
against the other fighters to move the other fighters up.

226
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,330
I've had a few tough fights, but that's not who I am.

227
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,770
The next fight's going to show who I am.

228
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,020
Yeah, and he's going to lose that one, too.

229
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,850
Scotch and soda, Charlene. And one for yourself.

230
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,350
Now move that sugar ass...

231
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,630
Okay, be respectful. Don't disrespect her.

232
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,530
Hey, don't hurt your hand. You've got a fight next week.

233
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,460
Besides, you wipe your ass with that one.

234
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,600
Don't wait up, or I'm going

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,280
to hit you in the car, sucker, all right?

236
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,610
He's gonna be so lame.

237
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,670
All right? All right?

238
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,200
That's right.

239
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,160
Take your drink. He's taking his drink.

240
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,690
This guy's going to be champion.

241
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,540
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,100
Okay? Hold on. Thanks for the drink.

243
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,450
You know those cameras are making a movie about him?

244
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,310
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO.

245
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,670
That's why they're following him around with the cameras.

246
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,590
They're making a movie about his comeback.

247
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,500
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,580
But who are you fighting?

249
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
- Saoul Mamby. - Saoul Mamby?

250
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,580
- What kind of name is that? - Black and Jewish.

251
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,390
Where did they find a guy like that?

252
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,550
He's no joke. Former world champion.

253
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,430
- Former champ? - Yeah.

254
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,960
- I match up good with him, though. - Yeah?

255
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,030
- Yeah. - What does that mean?

256
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,110
Well, I got a light end, you know?

257
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,180
I've got a reputation for brawling,

258
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,270
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

259
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,980
- I'm going to try to box him. - There's a difference?

260
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,830
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.

261
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,970
I hit you. You hit me.

262
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,640
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

263
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,520
Got to pick my punches to take him down.

264
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,580
I'm going head, body, head, body...

265
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,670
What is head, body, head, body?

266
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,130
Well, I hit him in the head,

267
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,540
then his hands got to go up to protect himself.

268
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,820
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,

269
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,070
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

270
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,170
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

271
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,330
People who don't know fighting

272
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,100
think you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

273
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,510
but you actually do more hitting the body.

274
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,470
So what do you think? Can I take you out?

275
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,440
Are you married?

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,260
No, would I ask you out if I was married?

277
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,380
What kind of guy do you think I am?

278
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,990
Happens all the time, trust me.

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,380
I'm not like that.

280
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,

281
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,790
I see her every other weekend.

282
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Her name is Kasie. But that's it.

283
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,300
Come on, let me take you out.

284
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,730
When?

285
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,070
Saturday night I'll be back in Atlantic City.

286
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,890
Is this the real number?

287
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,760
You'll have to call it and see.

288
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,090
I will.

289
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,970
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

290
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,650
Hey. What's up?

291
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,680
Micky, hey. How's it going?

292
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,750
I don't think Laurie's expecting you right now.

293
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,280
What's he doing here? This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

294
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,300
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,990
It's not your day, goodbye.

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,940
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

297
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,670
Now you're ditching the days you do have?

298
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,510
No, I have a fight. I told you that.

299
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,090
- Jimmy... - I can't get in the middle.

300
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,310
I can't talk to her, okay? So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

301
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,730
I want to talk to my daughter now.

302
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,200
- Talk to your father. - God damn it, Jimmy.

303
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,320
Hi, Daddy. - Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

304
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,780
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that after I win,

305
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm gonna start making big money.

306
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,550
And I'll move into a bigger apartment, like we talked about,

307
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,810
so you can live with me more days, okay?

308
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,930
Yeah, a bigger apartment!

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
- Wish me luck, all right? - Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

310
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,720
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

311
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,960
Good luck, Daddy.

312
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,180
Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

313
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,460
Bye, baby.

314
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,370
- Where is he? - Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

315
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,110
Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.

316
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,540
All that shit in my face...

317
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,120
I know it's none of my business. I go to a lot of meetings,

318
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,240
and they have a saying: "Let go and let God."

319
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,210
You've got to let him go,

320
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,640
- Mick. - He's taught me everything I know.

321
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,510
He's been in my corner. I can't do it without him.

322
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,690
- You're already doing it without him. - No I'm not.

323
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,540
Yes you are.

324
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,460
Look, you know where he is.

325
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,870
Why don't you just go get him?

326
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,330
Can you get him?

327
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm not fucking going to get him.

328
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,270
Well are we all going to go over

329
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,140
there in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

330
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,780
Dicky.

331
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,170
- Your mother's outside. - What?

332
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,790
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside. She's down there.

333
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm not here.

334
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,560
Don't, Dicky. Dicky! NO!

335
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,340
What the fuck are you doing?

336
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,840
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

337
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,550
We've got a flight to catch.

338
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,780
You know how important this fight is to me.

339
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,430
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right? - She knows.

340
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,200
- Pick me up back at the house, all right? - Are you fucking...

341
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,760
She's in the driveway right now.

342
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,770
All right, but hurry up. She's in the fucking driveway.

343
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,450
We've got a flight to catch.

344
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,200
You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

345
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,020
- What are you doing? - Just trying to see what I have.

346
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,040
The fuck did you hit him for?

347
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,170
Why'd you make me do that to you?

348
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,330
- Jesus! - Oh, my God, Dicky...

349
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,110
I was on my way, Mom.

350
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,030
- What are you doing? - No, Mom. Mom...

351
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,680
Why can't we just go to the fucking airport for once, please?

352
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,480
Hey, Alice, what about your husband

353
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,250
who's laying on the fucking ground over here?

354
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,820
You want to help your husband?

355
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,610
What are you doing,

356
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,660
running in here like a silverback fucking gorilla?

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,290
- We had to get him, didn't we? - Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

358
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,480
You see Mamby?

359
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,240
See how Mamby's arm comes up?

360
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,830
Leaves his side open,

361
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,330
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

362
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,620
He'll be pissing blood. No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

363
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,970
- Hey, Lou. - Dicky, boy.

364
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,820
Hey listen, boy.

365
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,590
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

366
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,100
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,330
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

368
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,830
Like what?

369
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,510
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

370
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,790
Why not?

371
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,150
- He's got the flu. - Mamby got the flu?

372
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,090
Yeah.

373
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,660
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

374
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,570
- With who? - Mike Mungin.

375
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,060
Mike Mungin, who's that?

376
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,520
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison. - He's been out a few months.

377
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,640
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.

378
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,210
He's the only guy I could find.

379
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,400
My last three fights were rough, Lou.

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,050
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

381
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,040
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

382
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,120
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.

383
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
He's been sitting on his ass.

384
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,190
Could be an easy win for Mick.

385
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,090
Joey Farrell, remember him? He knocked his ass out.

386
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,850
And you knocked down Joey Farrell...

387
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,910
Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

388
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,860
Can't make weight. Might be a bit over, though.

389
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,030
How over?

390
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,400
- 162, 165... - 165?

391
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,470
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

392
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,110
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right? We prepared for Mamby!

393
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,260
This guy just got off the couch. Micky's in shape.

394
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,560
Road work, everything else. This other guy hasn't done dick.

395
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,790
Don't forget. You don't fight, nobody gets paid.

396
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,960
Lou, please...

397
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,100
All right. Um, Joey Farrell knocked him out...

398
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,870
Going to be a hell of a fight, huh?

399
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,150
I'm not doing this. 165 is big.

400
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,640
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

401
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,110
So what? He's a middleweight.

402
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,960
He just got off the couch.

403
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,390
He's got twenty pounds on me, Dicky.

404
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,310
Joey Farrell knocked him out. You knocked down Joey Farrell.

405
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,470
- You just said that. - Yeah but... You can't be scared.

406
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,460
- Scared? - Yeah.

407
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,450
Why don't you go fucking fight him?

408
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,440
I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

409
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,600
Go snap out the teeth. It's your big comeback, right?

410
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,050
That's what Alice wants.

411
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,750
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

412
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,460
All right, I knocked down Joey Farrell, okay?

413
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,030
But the guy is a middleweight.

414
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,970
I'm a welterweight.

415
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,100
What, they don't have a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

416
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,780
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right? He can do anything.

417
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah, Alice. No problem.

418
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,960
You watch from the outside now.

419
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,210
Ladies and gentlemen, Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

420
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,210


421
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,560
Holy shit!

422
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,670
Hey, look. There's Sugar Ray Leonard.

423
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,430
Hey, Ray. Sugar Ray. Over here.

424
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,430
Dicky, come on. Look at the size of that guy.

425
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,650
- Holy shit. - Yeah, holy shit.

426
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,300
That guy's no welterweight.

427
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,160
All right, Mick. Gonna have to learn to fuss you around. It's time now.

428
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,900
He did not just get off the fucking couch.

429
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,680
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

430
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,930
I don't care who that guy is. I don't care. Look at me.

431
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,540
You're Micky Ward. You're Micky Ward.

432
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,740


433
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,910
Micky Ward fighting a last-minute replacement from Philadelphia,

434
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,620
a much bigger man.

435
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,110
Punches smashing Ward.

436
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,380
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

437
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,910
Micky, what the fuck is wrong? Get rid of this dude!

438
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,420
Mungin didn't even know he'd be fighting today...

439
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,350
Come on, now, Mick!

440
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,890
Ward, a respected fighter.

441
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,560
You hope this mismatch doesn't hurt his confidence.

442
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,910
- You're a loser! - Loser!

443
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,800
You're a loser!

444
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,390
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

445
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,570
Hey, Dicky!

446
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,030
- How are you doing, man? - How are you?

447
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,420
165 pounds. ESPN screwed us.

448
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,520
- The guy was huge. - You know what I'm saying?

449
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,120
You know, I knocked Ray down.

450
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,620
I look like shit, but I knocked Ray down.

451
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,000
Let me buy you guys a drink, all right? You want a cold one?

452
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,420
- No, no, no... - A cold one!

453
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,330
I've got to leave. I've got a plane to catch. Next time.

454
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,280
Hey, Ray. HBO is making a movie on me, you know?

455
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,190
Can they call you?

456
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,220
I'm going to get a fight.

457
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,910
I'd like you to be there, for old times' sake.

458
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,080
You can commentate or something.

459
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,940
What's the movie about?

460
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,990
My comeback, right?

461
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,010
- Call me. - I'll call you.

462
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,550
Don't be a stranger.

463
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,890
He's my old pal.

464
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,530
- You going to the hospital? - What is that?

465
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,340
Look, Mick. Nobody's got heart like you.

466
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,590
You're a very talented fighter,

467
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,160
but you're not getting the right fights.

468
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,920
It's killing your chances.

469
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,200
What's he talking to Mike Toma about?

470
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,110
I don't know what that is.

471
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,960
I want to give you a real shot.

472
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,350
I want you to come with me.

473
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,360
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

474
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,240
- Where? - Las Vegas.

475
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,240
Do it right and make one last run at this thing before it's too late.

476
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,030
What about my brother?

477
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,640
With all due respect, he's too much trouble.

478
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,730
You owe it to yourself to come to Vegas.

479
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,480
Come on, Mick. What has Dicky done for you?

480
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,570
He gets you into fights.

481
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,450
He lets you get beat like you did tonight.

482
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,660
You know you never should have been in that fight.

483
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,340
Eighteen pounds. Think of it that way.

484
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,990
You should have given it up.

485
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,400
Get out of the car there. Come on, you!

486
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,170
- Sit the hell down. - Just a little more scotch for Mom, okay?

487
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,810
Here you go. Nice and easy.

488
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,410
Don't hurt yourself coming back, old broad.

489
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,350
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray...

490
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,440
He's a beautiful man, isn't he? Right?

491
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,010
A beautiful man.

492
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,010
You should have seen the way he was looking at her.

493
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,780
- He's a pretty man, huh? - He's a good guy. I like him. I know.

494
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,790
I seen him ringside,

495
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,150
and he was so happy seeing me and Mick together.

496
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,470
You know he's all about family, that guy.

497
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,440
Likes to see a family stick together.

498
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,150
Mick, what'd Mike Toma want with you last night, huh?

499
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,690
He wants to train me in Vegas.

500
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,150
You can't trust that guy, Micky. He ain't family, you know?

501
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,560
You don't know him.

502
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,800
He say anything about me? He say I could come?

503
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,610
He didn't mention you.

504
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,470
What are you going to do in Vegas without your brother, huh?

505
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,720
That guy just wants to use you, like a piece of toilet paper.

506
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,870
What are you going to do in Vegas without Dicky? Without your family?

507
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,290
I know. That's what I told him.

508
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,170
You told him that, right?

509
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,920
Yeah, I told him. I said I need to be with my family.

510
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,560
That's right. Nothing wrong with that.

511
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,360
Sugar Ray said call him. We're going to call him, baby.

512
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,850
You guys can spar a little, right?

513
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,610
There's my champ. Daddy's home. Daddy's home!

514
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,600
I love you...

515
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,160
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

516
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,370
Because it's killing me.

517
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,000
- Come on... - Uncle Micky win the fight?

518
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,580
No, Uncle Micky didn't win this time. Not this time.

519
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,520
Hey, Mick. Take care. I'll call you tomorrow.

520
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,940
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

521
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,540
I don't know, Mom. I don't think I want to do this no more.

522
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,010
What don't you want to do no more?

523
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,500
I just don't want to do it anymore.

524
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,370
- What are you talking... - Hey, Mick.

525
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,240
ESPN screwed us. They owe us.

526
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,460
We'll get another fight. You heal up.

527
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,850
- It'll be okay. - Yeah, listen to your brother.

528
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,140
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

529
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,770
Hey, maybe they'll even do Dicky's comeback fight.

530
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,290
What do you think, huh?

531
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,300
Oh, come on. Cheer up. You take a little soap when you get home.

532
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,360
Have a day or two to think about it.

533
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,530
I'll find you a better fight, sweetheart.

534
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,340
Much better fight. I'm going to talk to them.

535
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
- For Christ's sake, Alice. - What?

536
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,070
He's been through the ringer. Leave him alone.

537
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,980
What are you talking about?

538
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,030
- Leave him some time to himself. - What is your fucking problem?

539
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,920
Where's Micky? Is Micky not going to come in?

540
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,790
No, he's not coming in. He needs to get back and get some rest.

541
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,370
Come on. Let's go inside.

542
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,710
He's going to go rest. He's all grumpy.

543
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,760
He's tired. He's beat up. He's a little embarrassed, I think.

544
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,400
Who is it?

545
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,920
I saw the shade move.

546
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,380
Micky, the shade is still moving. I saw you come to the window.

547
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
I know you're in there.

548
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,680
The least you can do is open up this door

549
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,240
and tell me to my face why you didn't call me yesterday.

550
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,890
Why did you stand me up last night?

551
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,690
I started to call. I was going to call. I just couldn't.

552
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,280
Because you lost the fight?

553
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,110
Maybe, yeah. Because I lost the fight.

554
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,030
How do you know my house anyway?

555
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,880
I asked my brother.

556
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,820
Your thing's coming off. And your other thing.

557
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,630
You got any tape?

558
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,200
Did the black Jewish guy do this to you?

559
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,380
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

560
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,850
You didn't get to go head, body, head?

561
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,240
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

562
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,200
Guy that took his place had twenty pounds on me.

563
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
I never should have fought him.

564
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,800
Why did you?

565
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,170
Nobody would have got paid.

566
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,680
Everybody said I could beat him.

567
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,140
Who's everybody?

568
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,800
My mother and my brother.

569
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,650
So are you going to take me to dinner and a movie, or what?

570
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,240
- You look great. - Thank you.

571
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,110
You've got a nice house, too.

572
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,550
It's an apartment building.

573
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,730
There's five of them in there.

574
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,200
One of my old roommates lives with me.

575
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,880
Roommate? What, were you in the army?

576
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,090
- College. - College? Wow.

577
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,860
Yeah, a lot of good it did me. I work in a bar.

578
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,520
You seem to enjoy it. Very popular down there.

579
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,430
Ugh, yeah. Popular. I've got to get out of there.

580
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,290
If I don't drink while I'm working I'll fucking kill myself.

581
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,420
- What college? - URI. Full boat.

582
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,700
- A full boat's a scholarship, right? - Yeah.

583
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,160
For what?

584
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,150
- I was a high-jumper. - High-jumper?

585
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,630
You've got to be kidding me.

586
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,130
Fuck you. I was good.

587
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,030
I was New England champ. I cleared 5'8".

588
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,940
Never graduated. I partied too hard.

589
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,300
You?

590
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,780
What are we doing in richie-rich Lexington?

591
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,340
You come to this theater a lot?

592
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, it's a good theater. They've got good movies here.

593
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,480
- Yeah? Like what? - Belly Epi-cue.

594
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,550
I think it's Bell Epic.

595
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,290
It's epic. Bell Epic.

596
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,710
Belle Epoque. The New York Times don't lie.

597
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,650
Well I never heard of it.

598
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,860
Where'd you hear about it? The New York Times?

599
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,860
No, a guy from work.

600
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,200
And the cinematography is supposed to be gorgeous.

601
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,250
Oh. Cool.

602
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,960
That's the movie you wanted to see?

603
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,200
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

604
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,400
Had to read the whole fucking movie. Fucking subtitled.

605
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,670
Some guy from a road crew recommended it to you?

606
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,470
A fucking subtitled movie?

607
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,140
What's going on, huh?

608
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,870
What's going on? You got a girlfriend or something?

609
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,590
You hiding me from her?

610
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,210
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

611
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,020
I like you.

612
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,280
I came here because I don't want to show my face in Lowell.

613
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,950
I told everybody I was going to win that fight

614
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,730
and get back on track.

615
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,790
I told my daughter I was going

616
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,450
to get a bigger apartment so she could move in.

617
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,430
You don't think I wanted to call you?

618
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,690
I was embarrassed.

619
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,090
I'm sick of being a fucking disappointment.

620
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,200
You really think your family is looking out for you?

621
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,840
Don't say that. I don't like that.

622
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,640
What else I can say after what you told me?

623
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,380
Look at your face.

624
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,480
Look at you.

625
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,110
Bullshit, Lou.

626
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm not going to stop calling until

627
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,740
you make this right and get us a fight that's fair.

628
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,310
My boy could have got killed last time.

629
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,410
Yeah, like what?

630
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,210
Just don't tell me he just got off the fucking couch.

631
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,600
Coming off a loss?

632
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,640
That sounds very interesting. I'll get back to you.

633
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,650
Got a great opportunity here.

634
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,260
We've got to go find Micky.

635
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,270
Nobody's seen him for, like, three weeks.

636
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,540
Jesus...

637
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,080
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find. Now it's both of them?

638
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,300
Mom, I think he's with that girl from the bar.

639
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,470
- What girl? - It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

640
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,750
That's who he's with. That girl from the bar.

641
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,470
George was all fucking eager for them to get together.

642
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,030
- I heard she's into three-ways. - Yeah, with other girls.

643
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,070
Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

644
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,340
MTV girls? What are you talking about?

645
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,450
Wild.

646
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,380
She acts all fucking superior because she went to college.

647
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,530
You girls just go find your brother Micky.

648
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,970
Tell him I've got important business to discuss.

649
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,910
I've got to go find Dicky.

650
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,920
Dicky!

651
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,420
Hey, Mom. It's not... It's just...

652
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
It's just a friend's house.

653
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,050
Come on, whatever.

654
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,110
I started a joke,

655
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,220
which started the whole world crying.

656
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,460
Oh, if only I'd seen

657
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,500
that the joke was on me.

658
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,390
I started to cry,

659
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,620
which started the whole world laughing.

660
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,550
Oh, if only I'd seen

661
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,020
that the joke was on me.

662
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,040
I looked at the skies,

663
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,840
running my hands over my eyes,

664
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,530
and I fell out of bed,

665
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,320
hurting my head...

666
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,840
So you're Beaver, and you're Red Bear.

667
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,390
Red beard.

668
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,940
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

669
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,500
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

670
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,160
Yeah, don't use those names. It's just for family.

671
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,610
Be nice.

672
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,170
Don't use the nicknames.

673
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,650
What the fuck will I call them then?

674
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,090
Speaking of family...

675
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,100
Hello.

676
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,940
- Alice, this is Charlene. - Hi.

677
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,270
I've heard a lot about you.

678
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,010
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

679
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,070
- What's that supposed to mean? - Same thing you meant.

680
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,050
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

681
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,390
I got you another fight, Mick.

682
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,250
Just like I said I would.

683
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,880
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

684
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,680
Just like I told you.

685
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,930
Joe Melenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

686
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,690
He's a... Ten in eight. He's none.

687
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,570
And they're going to pay us twenty grand.

688
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,560
$17,500, technically.

689
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,970
All right, $17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

690
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,880
Yeah.

691
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,420
That's good, Dick.

692
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm just trying to figure out what's best for me.

693
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,580
Like what, huh?

694
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,410
What's best for you, sweetheart?

695
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,400
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.

696
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,240
Why aren't you more excited?

697
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,390
It's a good fight, good money.

698
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,170
I got something with Lou Gold.

699
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,980
He knows us.

700
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,140
I know, Mom.

701
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,340
I just don't want things going the way they've been going.

702
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,390
Mick, that last fight was unfair. That was unfair.

703
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,980
And we ain't going to repeat that,

704
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,280
- right? - Oh, not on your life.

705
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,540
You know, buddy, it's just you in the ring.

706
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,140
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

707
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,300
But I don't like the way things have been going here.

708
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,400
- Where? - Where?

709
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,400
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

710
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,240
- George, stay out of it! - You're doing all the talking.

711
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,240
- Let him talk. Listen. - I'm asking him.

712
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,310
- You're telling him. Listen. - Stay out of it.

713
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,500
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

714
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,730
Mick, what's the problem?

715
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,530
- Problems. - What problems?

716
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,060
- Problems... - Like what?

717
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,150
Like maybe you not showing up on time to train.

718
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,480
Like maybe him having to come find you in a crack house

719
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,660
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

720
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,860
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are. Why are you talking?

721
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,970
I'm Charlene. We just met.

722
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,360
We're together. Do we need to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

723
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,200
- Hi, Charlene. - Hi.

724
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,070
- Hi, I'm Charlene. - Hi, Charlene.

725
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,670
Hey, we're together.

726
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,590
What are you going to do, Mick?

727
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,150
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

728
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,130
What does she know about boxing?

729
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,970
I know they're going to Vegas

730
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,380
and getting paid to train year-round.

731
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,020
Sounds a hell of a lot better than

732
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,140
what you've got him doing here.

733
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,900
You going to let her talk like that to your mother?

734
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,270
Come on, Micky.

735
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,530
I told you, we're together.

736
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,330
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

737
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,900
I have done everything. Everything I could for you, Micky.

738
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,170
This MTV girl comes along...

739
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,260
Stop calling me an MTV girl, whatever the fuck that means.

740
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,140
- Skank. - Wild.

741
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,440
I've been doing this over fifteen years.

742
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
She comes in, disrespects me...

743
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,480
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

744
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,540
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

745
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,190
Year-round, okay? That's all she's talking about.

746
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,270
I would hope that you guys could appreciate that.

747
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,650
I know what you're talking about, all right?

748
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,020
I could have had that.

749
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,600
You know, I had opportunities like maybe you're going to have.

750
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,320
Now, you want money so you can train year-round? Yeah?

751
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,010
I'll get you money so you can train year-round.

752
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,180
- You? - Yeah, I'll do it.

753
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,040
- Trust me. - How?

754
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,560
Hey, trust me, all right?

755
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,760
Done.

756
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,020
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

757
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,870
So you put in $200...

758
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,930
Then you get ten other people to put in $200...

759
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,050
And you've got your $2000.

760
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,220
Everybody give you $200?

761
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,570
No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

762
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,880
Ten lucky ones.

763
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,590
- You'll rip us off. - No, no.

764
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,240
- Give you an opportunity. - You give me $200!

765
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,290
No, you get that from ten other people

766
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,010
who you offer the opportunity to.

767
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,480
Right? You understand? No?

768
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,940
He thinks you think Cambodian people are stupid.

769
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,750
I love Cambodian people!

770
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,130
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

771
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,510
She's my girlfriend. She's beautiful. I love her.

772
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,940
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

773
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,140
Not so much lately.

774
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,260
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

775
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,820
You haven't been showing up, that's what I'm saying.

776
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,450
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

777
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,710
White people do this to other white people.

778
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,010
It's what makes the world go around.

779
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,070
I don't think that's helping.

780
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,980
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

781
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,660
I mean, they didn't understand.

782
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,690
They're practically on my game...

783
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,490
Usually they listen to what I say,

784
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,630
but they just didn't understand the opportunity.

785
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,370
I mean, it was awesome.

786
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,870
What were we talking about?

787
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,470
- Before you fought Sugar Ray. - Right, right, right.

788
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,180
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.

789
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,940
I needed to build up slow.

790
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,450
What's this movie about again?

791
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,920
I told you, it's about crack addiction.

792
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,780
Showing what it really is so kids can see it for real.

793
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,430
Fuck. We've got to get Mick's money.

794
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,970
Yeah! That was awesome!

795
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,270
- Get out of the car! - Oh, shit!

796
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,500
Put your hands on the roof!

797
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,470
Put your hands on the roof, that's it!

798
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,160
- Empty your pockets. - Are you a cop?

799
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,560
Get on the fucking sidewalk,

800
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,420
move! Fucking move! Don't turn around!

801
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,720
Don't turn around! We'll have to take your vehicle.

802
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,090
- How am I going to get home? - That's your problem.

803
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,750
How much we got here? Count it.

804
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,240
What the fuck?

805
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,120
That's the guy!

806
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,870
He did it to me and he's doing it again!

807
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,980
Get on the ground right now!

808
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,040


809
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,040
Open the door! I've got to get off the fucking street!

810
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,150
I'm trying to get off the fucking street!

811
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,660
It's Dicky. The cops are fucking punching him.

812
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,670
They're beating him. He needs help.

813
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,280
Stay here. Don't get up. Stay here.

814
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,130
Listen to him. Stay right here.

815
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,850
Are you fucking kidding me?

816
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,660
Hey what the fuck? Come on.

817
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,830
Just put him in the car. You don't need to do that.

818
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,060
Want to get involved? Now you're involved.

819
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,060
Get out of my brother, or I will kill you.

820
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,420
He's a fighter. Break his fucking hands

821
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,420
I do nothing.I do nothing.

822
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,390
Micky your hand... Your hand...

823
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,030
Separate cars, separate cells.

824
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,470
I don't want them making up some bullshit defense story.

825
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,150
Come on, folks, time to go home. Let's go.

826
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,430
- Hey, Dicky! - What the fuck, man?

827
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,870
- Dicky! - Jesus Christ.

828
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,990
His hands...

829
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:40,280
Welcome back, Dicky. That's 27 arrests.

830
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,990
Ward: One count of disturbing the peace,

831
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,530
released on your own recognizance.

832
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,430
Eklund: Three counts of assault and battery on a police officer,

833
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,270
two counts of resisting arrest,

834
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,370
two counts of larceny from a person,

835
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,800
two counts of impersonating a police officer.

836
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,930
Bail set at $25,000.

837
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,710
Case continued two weeks from today.

838
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,500
I'm wondering about the File 357.

839
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,590
I need a copy of the discovery report, as well.

840
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,700
- Mick, you're going to say it was self-defense, right? - What?

841
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,860
You're going to say it was self-defense, right?

842
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,610
You came outside, you seen them beating on me.

843
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,170
I didn't do nothing.

844
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,960
I was just waiting outside like anybody else.

845
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,100
Mick, I was doing it for you.

846
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,620
- You did it for me? - Yes.

847
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,900
This? Do me a favor.

848
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,650
Don't do fucking nothing for me no more, okay?

849
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,270
I'm fucking dont lying for you.

850
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,360
What are you going to do without me, huh?

851
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,810
Huh? This ain't how it was going to go down.

852
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,060
They should have just put me in the car, huh?

853
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,810
Mick, come on! Mick!

854
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,440
Dicky, hey! What's up, Dicky?

855
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,750
Hey, that's the man!

856
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,310
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

857
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,250
Dicky! Dicky! Dicky!

858
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:02,690
Who is it?

859
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,860
I don't want to see you, Micky.

860
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,280
Charlene...

861
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,220
I can't take it.

862
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,120
I'm not going to let you or your family drag me down.

863
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,140
I'm quitting, Charlene, okay?

864
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,050
I don't fighting. I don't need it anymore.

865
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,570
- That's fucking stupid. - What? Why?

866
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,280
Because it's sad that

867
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,210
you let them take it away from you with their stupid bullshit.

868
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,030
What else I can do, Charlene?

869
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,770
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

870
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,850
There's this guy that your dad wants you to meet,

871
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,900
you just don't think you can do it without Dicky.

872
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,890
Charlene...

873
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,420
- Don't call. - Come on.

874
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,600
Don't call me, okay?

875
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,710
Hey, Dicky, you hurt bad?

876
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,900
Poor fucker.

877
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,140
Hey, Micky, bring another bucket, huh?

878
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,580
Good.

879
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,360
And this Friday, an HBO original documentary.

880
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,540
Right here in Lowell, Mass., the story of Dick Eklund,

881
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,270
the once promising boxer who turned criminal.

882
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,790
Oh, look who it is.

883
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,870
That's... That's Dicky's brother.

884
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,970
- Hey, Micky. - Regular.

885
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,230
- Hey, what's up, man? - Look who's here.

886
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,140
- Good to see you, bro. - How are you doing?

887
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,930
How you feeling? How's the hand?

888
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,140
- Uh, it's getting there. - Looks better.

889
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,690
Why don't you come down to the gym?

890
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,350
We'll work out, if you want.

891
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,340
You fat fuck, you're getting big.

892
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,320
Yeah, I know. It's just...

893
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,840
Roofing for my father and spending more time with Kasie.

894
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,000
By the way, this movie on HBO, man.

895
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,430
What are you boys looking at?

896
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,850
The movie's not about him. It's about his crazy brother.

897
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,120
I should go.

898
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,820
- Come back to the gym, Mick. - Bye, Mick.

899
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,740
Don't go watch that crazy shit on TV. Don't.

900
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,930
Going to Hollywood...

901
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,950
Let's get this started!

902
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,060
Lowell was the birthplace

903
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,100
of the Industrial Revolution in America.

904
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,780
- Oh, that's... - These people came to find...

905
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,080


906
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,990
I used to live over there.

907
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,080
This town's got good memories, right?

908
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,770
- Check it out. - Fuck yeah.

909
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,990
This house right up this way, the white house...

910
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,790
- Oh, yeah! - First time I got my crack over here.

911
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,130
Did you ever know they smoke crack at the white house?

912
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,830
The first time I did crack or whatever,

913
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,300
I was about twenty-three.

914
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,270
A friend of mine gave me a gram or whatever.

915
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:27,680
Fuck I wish that never happened.

916
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,730
Before that, I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

917
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,620
I was the only kid. I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

918
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,130
I'll tell you how crack was.

919
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,410
It enters your lungs. When it enters your lungs,

920
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,260
- I want to watch Daddy. - Oh, my God.

921
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,430
No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.

922
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,460
But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

923
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,840
No, you can't. You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

924
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,250
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

925
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,690
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

926
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,730
What... What can I sell you today? A python?

927
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,060
Yeah, check it out, man.

928
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,220
They're going to buy me some.

929
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,230
It's been a while. I'll take anything right now.

930
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,390
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.

931
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,690
I always dreamed about it, but...

932
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,510
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

933
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,930
Heck, yeah. Put it all on the map.

934
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,130
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, didn't you say?

935
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,380
Yeah, he knocked him down,

936
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,210
but I don't think it was a knockout.

937
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,020
I think he slipped.

938
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,010
He knocked him down.

939
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,530
- He didn't slip. - He slipped.

940
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,150
- Oh, Jack... - Come on.

941
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,670
That's a fucking lie!

942
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,740
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

943
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,800
What are you doing?

944
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,420
Are you talking shit about the family?

945
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,560
No, not at all.

946
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,470
Yeah. I heard you say.

947
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,810
We're not like that.

948
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,870
This is not what Lowell is all about.

949
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,150
I thought he could make a comeback

950
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,290
and make us proud, but he didn't.

951
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,160
I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

952
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,320
Very disappointing. Very disgusting.

953
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,340
You brought the city of Lowell back thirty years.

954
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,310
We're not happy.

955
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,040
- Hello? - Jimmy.

956
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,190
Hey, will you do me a favor?

957
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,860
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

958
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,660
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

959
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,540
but don't worry about it. I got it...

960
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,280
I want her to see it.

961
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,780
Let her see who her uncle is.

962
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,290
- What? - Who you are.

963
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,570
Who I am? What are you talking about?

964
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,100
Kids need to know the truth, Mick.

965
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,900
Laurie, turn it off, please.

966
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,400
She does not need to see this.

967
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,380
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

968
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,030
If you're on crack,

969
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,660
you feel so much lighter.

970
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,280
You know, you feel young.

971
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,870
And everything is so funny.

972
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,200
Everything is just...

973
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,530
Everything is... It wasn't funny.

974
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,830
And then it fades,

975
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,230
then you've got to get high again.

976
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,850
Your part of the movie's going to end

977
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,320
with you going to jail.

978
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,570
We know Dicky. We're going to take care of him, huh?

979
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,290
You guys can't talk to him.

980
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,260
Turn that shit off. Turn this off, all right?

981
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,470
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

982
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,610
You don't turn this off. I'm turning it fucking off.

983
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,020
Hey, that's my life. That's my fucking life up there.

984
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,860
- I want to watch this. I don't care. - I will fuck you up.

985
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,290
You fucking want some? Don't fucking try me.

986
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,490
I still fucking won it, okay? You fucking want some?

987
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,010
That's my son there. You're laughing at him?

988
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,580
That's my son, he's crying,

989
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,620
he needs me, and I'm fucking stuck in here?

990
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,410
Micky, are you watching this?

991
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,420
What are they doing to us?

992
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,400
I don't know what to tell you.

993
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,800
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.

994
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,070
He's been doing this for years.

995
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,660
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom. But...

996
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,160
What do you think?

997
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,570
You think they set him up?

998
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,470
Mom, what do you think he was doing?

999
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,060
You know, they gave him money,

1000
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,950
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

1001
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,590
Micky?

1002
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,140
- You got a new bag, huh? - Yup.

1003
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,710
- New bracket, too? - Yup.

1004
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,160
- What happened to the peanut? - Don't know.

1005
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,690
Like a beach ball.

1006
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,750
Good job.

1007
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,080
- Mick, Sal Lanano. - Hey, Mick. How you doing?

1008
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,120
You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?

1009
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,460
He's very organized.

1010
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,870
- How's the hand? - It's good, you know?

1011
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,160
It's getting better. Stronger.

1012
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,240
You know, I made a few calls already.

1013
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,790
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

1014
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,090
He said he can set up something local.

1015
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,450
You know, something to start back with.

1016
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,810
- Get your confidence back. - That's it.

1017
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,130
You've got to get your confidence back.

1018
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,800
That's all.

1019
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,700
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

1020
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,670
And he wants me to train you,

1021
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,320
But he'll only do it on one condition.

1022
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,270
- No crazy time nonsense. - That's how it's got to be.

1023
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:07,190
- No Dicky, no Alice. - No Dicky, no Alice.

1024
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,220
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.

1025
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,860
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

1026
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,810
Can't take the bullshit, Mick. No offense, George.

1027
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,500
None taken. I mean,

1028
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,340
I'm going to be the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

1029
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,450
Yeah, you laugh.

1030
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,740
- You traitor! - What are you doing?

1031
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,260
What the hell's the matter with you?

1032
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Come on!

1033
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,010
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

1034
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,800
- Sal Lanano is a good man! - A good man?

1035
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,030
- He's a legitimate businessman! For Christ sake. - Legitimate businessman?

1036
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,790
- What? - Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

1037
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,450
- He's a crook, George! - He owns a taxicab company!

1038
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,790
- He's organized! - Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

1039
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,400
- He knows everything about boxing, right? - Yes.

1040
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,900
I don't think so!

1041
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,120
I think he's going to steal your son's money and rob him blind!

1042
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,910
Why would you think that? Why would you even think that?

1043
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,510
- Why can't you trust anybody? - I know people.

1044
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,150
I know, George. You think I don't know anything. But I know people.

1045
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,400
I know you know things...

1046
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,180
And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

1047
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,790
We don't need that in our lives!

1048
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,900
We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

1049
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,450
You betrayed me. You betrayed me.

1050
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,810
Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

1051
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,130
- You're always have to say... - He's a fucking crook!

1052
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,070
What's Micky supposed to do? Dicky's in jail.

1053
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,220
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.

1054
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,020
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

1055
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,460
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should try something different...

1056
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,610
What are you doing, opening your mouth in my kitchen?

1057
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,970
You owe me $200.

1058
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,640
I said I was going to pay you next week.

1059
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,350
I don't want another word out of you.

1060
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,270
That was last month you told me two weeks.

1061
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,580
Do you take sides against me in my own house? You owe me money?

1062
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,490
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

1063
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:42,540
Really, who's going to look after Micky better than his own mother?

1064
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,230
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

1065
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,910
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

1066
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,990
We've got to get rid of her.

1067
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,570
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

1068
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,610
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?

1069
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,140
Is that what you're all telling me?

1070
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,770
- Huh? - I know where she lives.

1071
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,290
What are you picking on her for?

1072
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,900
She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.

1073
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,300
Yeah, the puke yellow.

1074
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,090
I'm going to talk to Micky. Sort this out for myself.

1075
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,420
- Yeah, sure. You go handle it with your vigilantes.  - Go.

1076
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,660
This is wrong, Alice!

1077
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,650
- I got it. - Get out of my way! Get in the car.

1078
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,420
Get in the car.

1079
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,500
Micky, are you in there?

1080
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,310
Up in there on the second floor.

1081
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,450
Micky!

1082
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,450
Where the hell are you, huh?

1083
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,440
Are you up there? Come on down.

1084
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,420
Where are you?

1085
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,920
Holy shit, Micky. Your mother and your sisters are here.

1086
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,170
No, no. Do not go out there, please.

1087
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,390
No, I'm not hiding from your crazy fucking family.

1088
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,600
Well, well, well. Look at this.

1089
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,950
Look at what?

1090
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,220
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

1091
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,010
- He's not hiding. - I wasn't talking to you.

1092
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,800
I was talking to my son.

1093
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,240
- What are you doing next to her? - I'm right here.

1094
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,860
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1095
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,470
Well you're not helping yourself with your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

1096
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,360
What are you going to do? Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

1097
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,640
All we ever wanted for you was to be world champion.

1098
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,470
Micky's a grown man. He can think for himself.

1099
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,890
- Shut your mouth. - Skank!

1100
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,300
Don't call me skank.

1101
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,560
I'll rip that nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

1102
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:56,400
I'm his mother and his manager.

1103
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,180
You're not my manager anymore.

1104
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:01,740
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay? I'm not getting any younger.

1105
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:04,670
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart? - How about me?

1106
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,200
I know you don't understand it but I had nine kids,

1107
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,190
and I love every one of you the same.

1108
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,270
You've got a funny way of showing it, letting him get beat up,

1109
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,430
- letting him get his hand broken. - Bastard. - You're crazy.

1110
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,470
- Bastard. - What did I just say to you?

1111
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,470
Let her go.

1112
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,220
Fuck you!

1113
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,120
Fuck!

1114
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,120
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

1115
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,430
- Fuck you, Charlene!  - Micky.

1116
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,490
- Skank! - I want them the fuck out of here.

1117
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:44,260
- You're fucking dead. - Fucking bitch!

1118
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,100
Gail! Oh, my God. What did she do to your nose?

1119
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,500
Let's get the hell out of here.

1120
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:00,170
What's happening to everybody? I don't understand, sweetheart.

1121
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,200


1122
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,930
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"? Because I don't.

1123
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,730
- "No E" Micky Ward. - Hey, somebody push that button.

1124
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,730


1125
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,590
- Where are we going? - To the ring.

1126
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,810
The ring's across the street.

1127
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,950
- The ring's across the street? - Yeah.

1128
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:02,540
Smaller venue. They've got no dressing rooms over there.

1129
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,540
It's a starter, Micky. Just a starter.

1130
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,770
Hey.

1131
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,220
Good luck.

1132
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,100


1133
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1134
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,400


1135
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400


1136
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,790
Visit for Dick Eklund.

1137
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,360
Dicky!

1138
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,670
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick. That's good.

1139
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,850
I know you know what I'm doing.

1140
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,230
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

1141
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,700
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

1142
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,880
I've got a new manager and Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1143
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,520
It's going good.

1144
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,830
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

1145
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,950
- On HBO. - Bet you're proud of that.

1146
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,330
- Fucking right. - HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

1147
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,640
I didn't think they were going to be invested in me.

1148
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,250
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it. - Wake up.

1149
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,510
They don't care if it kills you.

1150
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:42,070
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

1151
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,310
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

1152
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,080
- Why don't you see? - Oh, I see.

1153
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,610
How could I stand a chance without the great

1154
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:52,930
Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1155
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,550
You didn't give a fuck if I got killed by Mungin,

1156
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,570
now, all of the sudden,

1157
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,850
you're worried Sanchez is going to hurt me?

1158
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,950
Why?

1159
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,230
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck

1160
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,140
in here and can't be the center of attention no more?

1161
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,390
- You need it that bad? - It's a Mexican fight.

1162
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,250
He fights you, hits like a fucking mule, all right?

1163
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,470
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

1164
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:12,300
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano? He went right for it.

1165
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,040
He's a paper gangster. He's using you to steal money.

1166
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,790
Why can't you just shut up and be happy for me?

1167
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,900
I've spent the last ten years

1168
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,570
of my life in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1169
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,820
I've finally got a good thing going for me,

1170
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,050
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

1171
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,490
What's your plan? How are you going to fight Sanchez?

1172
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,440
I ain't going to talk about that.

1173
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,080
What's your plan?

1174
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:37,240
- I'm not here to talk about that. - Bullshit. Yes you are.

1175
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,390
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

1176
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,150
I can't watch it. They don't let us.

1177
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,840
It's too fucking violent, you know?

1178
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,080
Two minutes, Dicky.

1179
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,780
- They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,  - Dicky.

1180
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,810
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

1181
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,070
Hey, Mick. What is it?

1182
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,710
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't even have a plan?

1183
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,320
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1184
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,200
You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.

1185
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,830
I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

1186
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,500
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.

1187
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,200
He's weak against overhand right.

1188
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,910
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe? - Fuck you, Dicky.

1189
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,780
You've got to run against this guy. Let him burn himself out.

1190
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,260
Take it to the body, right? Get inside, switch stances

1191
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,060
like you're going to work his right. Hit him on the left.

1192
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,410
You ain't me. Okay, you can't be me.

1193
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,470
You had a hard enough time being you when you had your fucking chance,

1194
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,420
and that's why you're in here, all right?

1195
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,990
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1196
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm talking about the way you fight, you moron!

1197
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:40,710
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right. - All right.

1198
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,190


1199
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,990
Blow to the right.

1200
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:53,630
Ward just in. 29 wins, 7 losses so far.

1201
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,520
Twenty KOs.

1202
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,460
He's been a little better since he refocused himself on the sport,

1203
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,020
as J.B. pointed out.

1204
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,190
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

1205
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:13,360
out of Tijuana, Mexico. See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

1206
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,210
8 first-round KOs.

1207
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,550
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,

1208
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:19,310
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1209
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,960
He says that Sanchez is one of the most talented young prospects in the sport of boxing.

1210
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:40,040
This is really one of the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1211
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,240
Micky Ward is 31 years old. He's here because he needs the money.

1212
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,900
He's taking a beating.

1213
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,830
My point is that he doesn't really have to sit here and take this beating.

1214
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,300
- He can do something about it. - Which is what?  Have his corner throw in the towel?

1215
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,980
Or fight back.

1216
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,270
You can see his power. Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

1217
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,640
Unless the referee thinks he can't...

1218
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,460
The referee should just stop this fight.

1219
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,600
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

1220
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,410
 No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

1221
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,620
Running away, not hitting back.

1222
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,130
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

1223
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,810
Doing the same old shit.

1224
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,880
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

1225
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,960
He's doing what I told him, Mom. He's doing what I told him.

1226
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,820
Don't worry about it. He's doing what I told him.

1227
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,700
Micky Ward showing nothing but...

1228
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,630
What are you running around for? Stop running around.

1229
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,860
Shut the fuck up, Sal. Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,210
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.

1231
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,720
You want to fucking tell me?

1232
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:40,060
Because I don't know what you're doing.

1233
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,110
We'd have lost all five rounds.

1234
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,070
Is that what you want?

1235
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,160
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1236
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,360
You've got to show me something soon, Mick

1237
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,540
or I'm going to stop the fight.

1238
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,050
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

1239
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,960
He's got to go inside, Mom.

1240
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,990
He's got to take it to the body. He's got it.

1241
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:56,950
Don't stop the fight. Don't stop it.

1242
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,540
You've got to do something, baby. You've got to do something.

1243
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,140
Try what we talked about, Micky.

1244
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,070
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

1245
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,400
Let's go.

1246
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,250
All right, Micky. You've lost the first five rounds,

1247
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,610
what's the next strategy going to be?

1248
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,000
Double right hand by Sanchez, then a triple left hook.

1249
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,210
Couple of the left hooks landed flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1250
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,410
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1251
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,520
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

1252
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,700
Ward seems to be trying to land

1253
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,980
one big shot to either change Sanchez's mind...

1254
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,610
And he's beginning to open up,

1255
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:32,510
taking advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

1256
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,820
and throw against a fighter

1257
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,290
who is not defending himself by punching.

1258
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:41,130
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

1259
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:48,940
What are you doing? Come on.

1260
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,710
Come on!

1261
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,160
He's down on an uppercut.

1262
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,880
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

1263
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,080
Very good. And right after Ward threw a pretty good right hand.

1264
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,350
Mick, you all right?

1265
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,380
This is a fight that should be stopped.

1266
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:14,380
Come on, head, body, head.

1267
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,310
- This is not professional. - That's exactly what I'm saying.

1268
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,430
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

1269
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,300
Come on, Mick! Head, body, head.

1270
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,400
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1271
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:34,030
- Maybe he'll turn it around. - I'm talking about his body shot.

1272
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,960
Sanchez dropped by that shot! Oh, my God!

1273
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,580
What a punch!

1274
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,340
The most unlikely knockout you have ever seen!

1275
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,200
That is a kidney shot.

1276
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,890
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

1277
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,040
I still don't believe what I just saw!

1278
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,120
Micky! Micky! Micky!

1279
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,710
Micky won!

1280
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,320
Now did Micky Ward just make

1281
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,630
idiots of us all with a spectacular piece of strategy?

1282
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,110
- Take another look. - Amazing.

1283
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,610
A big win in the career of

1284
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,410
Micky Ward of Lowell, Mass.

1285
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,970
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

1286
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,400
who had all but given

1287
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,420
away the first half dozen rounds in the bout.

1288
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,840
I think what Micky did was he

1289
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,420
recognized that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

1290
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,650
Micky's a better fighter than

1291
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,590
that to not be running from that guy like that.

1292
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,800
Theater of the unexpected.

1293
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,550
Hey, you never know what can happen, right?

1294
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,680
Never give up in this game, right? Never give up.

1295
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,360
You can't make it up, folks.

1296
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,890
You know what Micky just said?

1297
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,850
He said you can't give up in this game.

1298
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:41,210
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say he should stop this fight,

1299
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,440
- and he went out and stopped it. - Yeah.

1300
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,100
I can't believe it.

1301
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,240
I'm looking over and I'm

1302
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,250
thinking to myself like they were thinking:

1303
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,490
This thing is over.

1304
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:52,600
But I tell you what. Even look at the commentators.

1305
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,880
They started to take their

1306
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,020
headsets off before he was even counted out.

1307
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,360
- They just wanted to get out of there. - Mick. Mick...

1308
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,620
I just spoke to Mike Toma again

1309
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,520
and he just told me something very interesting.

1310
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:04,180
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,

1311
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,500
he would have gotten the title shot.

1312
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,620
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful. - Why? Why is that beautiful?

1313
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,410
- A title shot. - Micky gets the shot.

1314
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,450
Are you sure about that?

1315
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,060
You've got to be very clear about this,

1316
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,330
- because this is my kid's future. - I just spoke to the guy.

1317
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,800
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys. - Hey. Congratulations.

1318
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,710
- Thank you. - Not a stepping stone anymore.

1319
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,330
I always knew you had the talent. That was a hell of a strategy,

1320
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,900
wearing him down like that and taking it to the body.

1321
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,090
Thirty years in the business,

1322
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,580
I've never seen a knockout like that.

1323
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,830
Larry Merchant was writing your

1324
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,060
obituary and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

1325
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,580
Where did you get that?

1326
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,270
That's the first thing my brother taught me.

1327
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,790
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

1328
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,810
- That's a hell of a body shot. - Thank you.

1329
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,200
You ready for a title shot?

1330
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,010
- Yes! - Yes!

1331
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,720
That's what I was talking about.

1332
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,660
He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

1333
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:54,300
Shea Neary in London for the title!

1334
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,630
Are you kidding me? We've got some celebrating to do.

1335
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,580
- Yeah, I think so. - Thank you so much.

1336
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,090
You're going to have a great champion, my boy.

1337
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,480
It's what your brother would have always wanted.

1338
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,110
He's not even going to be there.

1339
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:36,480
- Hey! - Daddy!

1340
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,700
- Hey there, buddy. - Daddy, Daddy!

1341
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:43,110
Good to see you! Oh!

1342
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,320
That's a good hug! That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

1343
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,650
- Sweetheart! - Hi, Mom.

1344
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:52,230
Oh, you look so good.

1345
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,800
Oh, my God.

1346
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:05,520
- You have clean teeth. - I do! Look at my teeth!

1347
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,750
I got new teeth. Everything.

1348
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,240
How do you think I look?

1349
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,610
- Good. - Yeah?

1350
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,430
- Are you going to carry me? - No.

1351
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,330
And more cake. Ice cream...

1352
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,420
- Ice cream with cake. - Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

1353
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,110
Ice cream, cake and cake. Ice cream, cake and cake.

1354
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,250
Quacker!

1355
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,970
Mom.

1356
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,010
- They gave you some new teeth, huh? - Yeah.

1357
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,240
Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?

1358
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,880
Run him out of the house, Mom?

1359
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,060
Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

1360
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,440
How you doing, Dicky?

1361
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,570
Let's spar, huh?

1362
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:32,600
Hi, Charlene.

1363
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,970
- Welcome back! - Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

1364
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,940
I'm running late.

1365
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,640
Mick, I can't even tell you.

1366
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,850
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

1367
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,620
Getting back with you is what got me through.

1368
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:14,450
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

1369
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,890
Alice says prison might have been the best thing for me.

1370
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:24,230
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

1371
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,480
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1372
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:31,050
I've got to talk to you about something.

1373
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,510
The old locker, huh?

1374
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:43,290
I made a promise to them I wouldn't work with you again.

1375
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:57,130
I had to, after everything that happened. I'm sorry.

1376
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,280
You sticking to that?

1377
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,190
I'm glad you're back.

1378
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,010
You look good.

1379
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,220
I don't know what else to say.

1380
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:24,000
- Mick, you fucking kidding me? - No, I'm not.

1381
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,330
- Hey, Micky. - Micky, come on in.

1382
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:34,610
You're too loud. You've got to do this at home, please.

1383
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,480
- What are you talking about? - Mom, please.

1384
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,280
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1385
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,830
- Why? - Let's get it put away.

1386
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,660
If that's what Micky wants, we're going to put it away.

1387
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,480
- There's your brother. - Dicky!

1388
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,950
Hey there. Hey there.

1389
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:26,090
It's nice. It's nice.

1390
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:29,280
- Been working on it for two weeks. - Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

1391
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,300
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.

1392
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,260
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

1393
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,170
- What's going on? - We ain't going to work together.

1394
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,150
They don't want me to work with him.

1395
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:46,150
What are you talking about?

1396
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,480
That's not right.

1397
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,810
Micky never would have won Sanchez without Dicky.

1398
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:55,520
That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!

1399
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:59,220
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that. - Fuck you!

1400
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,690
Why don't you ask Micky?

1401
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,630
We're going to train. They've got to go.

1402
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,620
They've got to go, Mick. Come on.

1403
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,510
- You all right? - Ask him, George.

1404
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,470
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez without his brother.

1405
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:19,950
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez if it wasn't for Dicky.

1406
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,710
- How can you say that to O'Keefe? - Because it's true.

1407
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,850
I went in with our game plan and it

1408
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:28,300
wasn't working so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

1409
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,020
And I wouldn't have won without you, either, O'Keefe, okay?

1410
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,130
I mean, you know that. We worked hard. You got me ready.

1411
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,830
You got your confidence and your focus from O'Keefe,

1412
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,700
and from Sal, and from your father, and from me.

1413
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,910
- Dicky is a junk bag. - Hey!

1414
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,260
He's a junk bag!

1415
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:47,850
- Fuck you, Charlene. - Oh, fuck you!

1416
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,940
I'm sober.

1417
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,050
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going

1418
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,690
to need something for something now that you're out.

1419
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,460
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!" - Fuck you!

1420
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,770
- What are you always picking on me for, huh? - No, fuck you!

1421
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,150
And what about O'Keefe? We're in the same boat.

1422
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,920
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe? You and me.

1423
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,250
It's all right for him to be here?

1424
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,680
Why am I the fucking problem?

1425
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,840
- I'm his blood! I'm his family! - You're the problem!

1426
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,420
I'm the one fighting, okay? Not you, not you, and not you.

1427
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,710
- I know what I need. - And you need Dicky?

1428
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,150
I want Dicky back.

1429
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,920
And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe.

1430
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:20,180
I want my family. What's wrong with that?

1431
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,290
- Not the deal we made, baby. - She's right, Micky.

1432
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:28,000
- That's not the deal. - It wasn't the deal.

1433
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,900
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1434
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,180
You sound like them now.

1435
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,980
- I sound like them now? - Yeah, you sound like them.

1436
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,330
We sound like them?

1437
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:36,540
You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

1438
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,900
You sound like them.

1439
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:41,080
You should fucking listen to yourself.

1440
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:42,510
You sound like them, just like them.

1441
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,740
Maybe this is where you belong.

1442
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,130
- That's the way you love him? - Charlene!

1443
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,540
- Come on! - You want your brother? Good luck.

1444
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,250
- O'Keefe, come on... - Micky.

1445
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,300
Micky...

1446
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,810
Come on, everything happens for a reason.

1447
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,660
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1448
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,770
God has a plan.

1449
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,430
Want to spar with your brother?

1450
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,820
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

1451
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,150
Watching that for years, huh?

1452
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,040
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

1453
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,560
- Micky, for crying out loud! - Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1454
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,090
Take that baby out of here.

1455
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,410
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

1456
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,200
Sweetheart, are you all right? You okay? Your back?

1457
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,630
What are you doing? What's the matter with you?

1458
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,750
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

1459
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,880
Just once? Maybe just this one time, not for Dicky?

1460
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,400
I know you think he's coming back,

1461
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,700
but he's forty years old and he

1462
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,010
doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

1463
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:59,400
Let your brother talk for a minute here, all right?

1464
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,190
What are you saying, sweetheart?

1465
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:04,000
Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

1466
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:07,050
What are you going to do?

1467
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,970
You want me to bust your fucking head open?

1468
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,120
Come on! Come on! George!

1469
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,050
- Please! Please! - Dicky!

1470
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:14,620
What are you saying, sweetheart? Tell me what you're saying.

1471
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,550
This is supposed to be my fight.

1472
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,020
- This is my shot at a title. - It is your fight.

1473
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,300
I won't get another one after this.

1474
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,830
Am I being selfish? Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

1475
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,820
Because you know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1476
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,010
I thought I was fighting for the championship.

1477
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,810
And I thought you were my mother, too.

1478
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,780
I am your mother.

1479
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:39,970
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt like that, all right?

1480
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:43,090
If I made mistakes, I'm going to be better.

1481
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,920
I don't want to hurt you. I am so sorry.

1482
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,880
I'm sorry.

1483
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,260
Dicky! Stay with him.

1484
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,710
Dicky!

1485
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,610
Dicky!

1486
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,660
- Dicky! - Got to do something.

1487
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,570
Dicky, wait. Come on.

1488
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,880
Micky wants you. I want you.

1489
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,730
I've got to do something.

1490
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,890
I know what that means. Don't do this!

1491
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,890


1492
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,020
Hey, Jim.

1493
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,180
- Smart. - Hey, Dicky.

1494
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:59,530
Hey, Dicky's back!

1495
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:01,220
Dicky!

1496
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:04,930
- Look at you! - Look at my boy, huh?

1497
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,080
Come over here.

1498
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,760
You look good. Welcome back.

1499
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,230
- Yeah, you're looking good. - You look great.

1500
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,260
Good to see you.

1501
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,020
- Welcome home. - Hi, honey.

1502
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,540
What's up, man? You're looking good.

1503
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,830
So, want to head up there?

1504
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,250
Dicky's back!

1505
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:30,480
Go upstairs, take a while, huh?

1506
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:41,150
- Throw a little party for you, babe. - Hey, come back!

1507
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,670
What the hell was that?

1508
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,220
Charlene, it's Dicky.

1509
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:07,720
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

1510
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,560
How fucking dare you come?

1511
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,080
Cock sucker!

1512
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,270
Fucking boy!

1513
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,260
Fucking ass!

1514
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,080
Fucking sick!

1515
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,410
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky. I want you off my fucking porch.

1516
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,800
Huh? Why don't you just

1517
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,340
fucking come down here and talk to me, huh?

1518
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,280
You're such an asshole, coming to my fucking house.

1519
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,480
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch! - Sorry, sorry.

1520
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,840
It's not fucking ladylike to

1521
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,080
be shouting in the street like this, all right?

1522
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:36,790
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here. - Please!

1523
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,760
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care? - Come on. Just fucking...

1524
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,060
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

1525
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,110
What kind of dog is that? Is that a cocker spaniel?

1526
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,060
All right, I know you can't fucking stand me.

1527
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:06,800
Really, what makes you say that?

1528
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,420
I got news for you, all right?

1529
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,170
My brother loves you,

1530
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:12,600
and you can't just run away because of me.

1531
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,930
He don't deserve that, all right?

1532
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,530
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1533
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,930
- You're full of shit. - I swear to God.

1534
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,150
I will quit if it means you'll come back, all right?

1535
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:23,960
But I want you to think about something.

1536
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:27,060
Micky has a chance to do something that I never did,

1537
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,310
that in my time, I never had.

1538
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,550
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance

1539
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:32,500
was with Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

1540
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,080
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.

1541
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,820
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

1542
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,500
- I've heard it. - I came to make things right with you.

1543
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:40,470
Okay, let's make things right. Number one:

1544
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,750
You didn't knock down Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1545
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,820
I was in the ring. Don't you

1546
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,780
think I know what really fucking happened that day?

1547
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,290
- What have you ever done with your life? - I like my life.

1548
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,390
Yeah? What have you ever done with it?

1549
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,140
I like my life now, Dicky.

1550
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:56,300
What have you ever done with your life?

1551
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,930
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1552
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,100
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

1553
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:03,210
All right.

1554
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,550
I drink too much. I worked in a lot of bars.

1555
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,260
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,

1556
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,820
but I'm trying to do better here.

1557
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,850
- So is Micky. - So am I.

1558
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,250
And he needs me, you heard him. And I know he needs you.

1559
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,810
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1560
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,530
It's icing.

1561
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:32,680
Okay.

1562
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,350
I'll see you in Micky's corner. Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1563
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,480
- It's a deal. - All right, it's a deal.

1564
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,090
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1565
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:56,960
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1566
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,770
I will.

1567
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,700
Hey, Mick.

1568
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,180
Do you think I knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard?

1569
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,570
You went ten rounds. One of the best to do anything to hurt him.

1570
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,770
You're my hero.

1571
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,410
I was.

1572
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:23,730
I was...

1573
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,350
- I'm sorry. - Yeah?

1574
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:22,480


1575
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,400
There's a press conference downstairs.

1576
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,830
- Come on. Let's go. - Guys...

1577
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:01,340
Neary, Ten stone, six pounds.

1578
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:12,140
Ward, Ten stone, six pounds.

1579
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,340
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward! We have a question over here.

1580
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:19,630
How have you been training?

1581
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,920
I train. I train hard.

1582
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,130
Shea's 22 in 0. Never been knocked down.

1583
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,050
Well that's going to change tomorrow.

1584
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,250
In fact we expected a much better fighter.

1585
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,360
I'm just grateful to be here and

1586
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,590
have the opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.

1587
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,200
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

1588
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,950
And who would you like to fight next?

1589
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:39,590
I plan on moving right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

1590
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:42,330
moving on to other big fighters, like Gatti.

1591
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,690
I believe Gatti and I would make a great match.

1592
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:02,060
And now, ladies and gentlemen, twelve rounds of boxing

1593
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:08,470
for the WBU Welterweight Championship of the World!

1594
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,310
Don't listen to them, Mick.

1595
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,110
And there is Micky Ward of Lowell,

1596
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,790
Massachusetts entering the ring.

1597
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,760
It's his first fight outside the United States.

1598
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:19,610
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses....

1599
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:22,920
He's back and better, recently. Twenty KOs.

1600
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:27,500
And now Ward awaits his opponent, Shea Neary.

1601
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,300
Neary regards himself as the European Arturo Gatti,

1602
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,590
meaning that he is a head-on high-contact fighter

1603
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,300
who throws seventy punches per round.

1604
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,690
Neary is from Liverpool

1605
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:43,380
and should have a huge following here tonight.

1606
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,590
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red" By the Mahone.

1607
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,030
Neary is the current Welterweight Champion of the World.

1608
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,420
He is a very tough young man.

1609
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:59,010
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

1610
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,390
And according to his promoters,

1611
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,320
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

1612
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:08,190
fantasize and dream of fighting.

1613
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,820
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights and won them all.

1614
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,380
Seventeen KOs.

1615
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:27,560
Start when you hear the bell. Shake hands.

1616
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,150
Both of you. Shake hands.

1617
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:34,450
As close as we just saw them

1618
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:38,090
in the middle of the ring, forehead to forehead.

1619
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:43,760
That's how close we expect them

1620
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,570
to be for as long as this fight goes on.

1621
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:48,620
Ward is a long ways from home. Don't coast in a foreign country.

1622
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,530
Well, the big challenge for Ward is

1623
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,580
to get off to a faster start than is customary for him.

1624
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:57,130
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter in big fights.

1625
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,620
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

1626
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,290
And that's the question that

1627
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:04,060
hovers over round one. Get ready for the fight.

1628
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,080
Already Shea Neary starts taking it to him on the ropes.

1629
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,620
And Neary going to the body, which is Ward's specialty.

1630
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:14,110
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1631
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:15,930
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1632
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:18,260
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1633
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,890
Keeps opponents off balance, jabbing here and there.

1634
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,900
That was a good left hook by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1635
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,800
Ward not able to deal with him

1636
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,760
very well when Neary stands at range like this.

1637
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:35,450
- Come on! - That's it! Get him!

1638
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,910
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

1639
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:42,050
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.

1640
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,260
They trade shots at close range.

1641
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:47,130
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

1642
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:48,970
and now Neary starts to come

1643
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:52,160
on and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

1644
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:54,600
- How about that! - Break!

1645
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,570
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.

1646
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,670
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

1647
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,170
What a great round one!

1648
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,270
Ward is going to have to pick up the tempo

1649
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,170
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1650
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,530
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

1651
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:19,750
Four hard right hands Neary has belted in the last minute.

1652
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,760
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.

1653
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,740
Surer of what he wants to do.

1654
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,920
They're standing and trading shots at the center of the ring.

1655
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:29,100
Ward's going to have to step

1656
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,990
it up a little bit more than he is right now.

1657
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,370
Micky Ward's corner taking

1658
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:34,560
a really deep look at what's going on now,

1659
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,790
and his family at ringside well aware he's stepping up in class.

1660
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:41,590
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

1661
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,300
He can't just try to wait until everything is perfect.

1662
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:46,940
Despondence over Micky Ward is increasing as the fight goes on

1663
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:51,070
because his plan was the right one and he's executing it.

1664
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:58,360
Punches like these make it seem that it's now Neary's fight.

1665
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:01,620
Ward hasn't been in this

1666
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:05,100
kind of war with as strong a fighter as Neary.

1667
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:10,150
They are trying to hurt each other with only punches.

1668
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,350
They've tested each other's will,

1669
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:14,930
now they're testing each other's skill.

1670
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,380
And Ward fumbled there by a right cross from Neary.

1671
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:21,060
Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.

1672
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:24,770
Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

1673
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:27,870
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1674
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:31,420
And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

1675
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,410
I don't know if he can, Jeff.

1676
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,400
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

1677
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,680
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

1678
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:44,050
Come on, that's it!

1679
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:46,650
That's my boy!

1680
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,580
Forward! Forward! Come on!

1681
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:55,860
- Ward is out on his feet! - Loser! Go back to America!

1682
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:58,000
This could be it for Micky Ward.

1683
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,680
Dicky, get him a fucking stool! Where's the stool?

1684
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:03,350
Charlene, will you get the fuck out of here with your high heels?

1685
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:08,890
His brother's got Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1686
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,010
I think this could be

1687
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,380
Ward's last chance to turn this fight around.

1688
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,140
It's Micky Ward against the

1689
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,220
aggressiveness and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1690
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:21,550
If you don't have your defense up you can really get hurt.

1691
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,280
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

1692
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:27,090
I don't think he's going to give it to him, at this rate.

1693
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,130
This is a survival move.

1694
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:32,880
Are you like me? Huh? Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1695
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,420
I never had to win, did I? You've got to do more than that.

1696
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:41,570
You've got to win a title. For you, for me, for Lowell.

1697
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:44,070
This is your time, all right? You take it.

1698
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:46,990
I had my time, and I blew it. You don't have to, all right?

1699
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,770
Now fucking get out there. Bring that fucking anger.

1700
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:53,410
All the shit you've been through over the fucking years,

1701
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,580
put it in the ring right now.

1702
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,060
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

1703
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,980
- Okay. - Fucking head, body, head, body.

1704
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:02,490
- Say it back to me. - Head, body, head, body.

1705
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:06,400
You can do it. Stay off the fucking ropes.

1706
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:13,360
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1707
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:14,770
I'm thinking if he doesn't

1708
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,930
pick things up this round and get going,

1709
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:21,130
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1710
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:23,610
Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes, Mick!

1711
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,920
Once again, Ward against the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1712
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:30,320
What are you doing? Come on, Mick...

1713
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,440
Sometimes if you want to win,

1714
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,660
you've got to be something that you're not.

1715
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:38,330
Off the fucking rope, man! That ain't it!

1716
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:41,380
Neary continues to pound away.

1717
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:47,710
Don't take no abuse! This is your time, Micky!

1718
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,710
It's all for you!

1719
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,980
- Two big misses by Neary. - That's it! That's it!

1720
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:55,840
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1721
01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:00,080
Now he backs Neary up. Ward trades his way back.

1722
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:03,140
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

1723
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:05,710
"Come on, let's fight!"

1724
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:09,110
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1725
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,730
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1726
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,370
And a left hook to the body, and an uppercut lands,

1727
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:17,090
and now he backs Neary up.

1728
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:20,100
Ward hits Neary with a body shot.

1729
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,850
Four left hooks in the body.

1730
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,830
Neary on his butt, first time in 23 professional fights

1731
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:32,470
that Shea Neary has gone down.

1732
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:34,900
This is it! This is it, Micky!

1733
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,810
23 seconds remain in this

1734
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:40,130
